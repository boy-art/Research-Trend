J	Wolfe, Dylan; Russell, Kelly								Garden/Art: The Nature-Based Sculpture Program of the South Carolina Botanical Garden								ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNICATION-A JOURNAL OF NATURE AND CULTURE				4	2			237	249	PII 922719639	10.1080/17524031003755341			2010	2010	This essay discusses an art program developed to engage viewers in environmental thought through unexpected experiences. Spread over 300 acres, the 15 nature-based sculptures of the South Carolina Botanical Garden (SCBG) are creative interventions developed with local natural materials to suit their separate unique sites. Since its inception in 1995, the SCBG's sculpture program has worked with artists of national and international prominence to create a world-renowned collection of nature-based site-specific sculptures. Placed in various terrains, without explanation, visitors to the garden experience the art outside of the more common context of gallery or museum space. The sculptures blur distinctions between nature and culture, as well as disrupt the presuppositions attached to public spaces, natural spaces, and artistic expression.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1752-4032			WOS:000278465500007

Participants made recommendations for the management of technical and biological variation. They also stressed the need for enhanced interdisciplinary training and communication as well as considerable investment into the generation and curation of appropriate reference omic data.CONCLUSIONS: The participants concluded that, although there are hurdles to pass on the road to regulatory acceptance, omics technologies are already useful for elucidating modes of action of toxicants and can contribute to the risk assessment process as part of a weight-of-evidence approach.									60	2	0	55	0	62			0091-6765			WOS:000273292800017	20056575

This may influence bioavailability and fate of both the nanoparticles and the other contaminants. The present study examined the effect of a combination of soluble copper and surface-modified single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) on Daphnia magna. Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) was used to modify the surface of SWNTs, reducing the surface hydrophobicity of the tubes and thereby producing a stable aqueous nanoparticle suspension. The toxicity of the nanoparticle-copper (Cu) mixture was determined to be additive. The addition of nontoxic concentration of LPC-SWNTs enhanced the uptake and toxicity of copper. Greater amounts of Cu were shown to accumulate in D. magna upon addition of 0.5 and 1.0 mg/L LPC-SWNTs. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2010;29:122-126.

Continuous exposures of suspended clay and silt have been shown to affect growth and reproduction of Cladocera, leading to a decrease in population growth rate. The mechanism of clay toxicity in these filter-feeding organisms is clogging of the gut tract, resulting in decreased food uptake and assimilation. When placed in clean water, daphnids can purge clay from their gut and recover. In many surface waters, aquatic organisms experience episodic exposures of high concentrations of suspended solids driven by rain events. However, little is known about the consequences of pulsed exposures on individuals and populations. The objective of the present study was to characterize the effects of continuous and pulsed exposures of natural and defined clays on survival, growth, and reproduction of Daphnia magna. Two defined clays, montmorillonite and kaolinite, as well as clay isolated from the Piedmont region of South Carolina, USA, were used. Continuous exposures of clays elicited a dose dependent decrease in survival. Toxicity varied depending on clay source with montmorillonite > natural clay > kaolinite. Pulsed exposures caused a decrease in survival in a 24 h exposure of 734 mg/L kaolinite. Exposure to 73.9 mg/l also caused an increase in the time to gravidity, although there was not a corresponding decrease in neonate production over 21 d. No significant effects resulted from 12 h exposures even at 730 mg/l, almost 10 times the 24-h reproductive effects concentration. This suggests that exposure duration impacted toxicity more than exposure concentration in these pulsed exposures. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2010;29:168-175.

Mounting evidence has revealed the important role of sirtuins in a variety of biological processes, including transcription regulation, apoptosis, DNA repair, metabolism, and more prominently, aging. Sirtuins regulate lifespan in evolutionarily diverse species partly through modulating calorie restriction pathways. Sirtuins link the nutritional status of the cell to transcription regulation through their nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+))-dependent deacetylase and/or ADP-ribosyltransferase. The unique features of sirtuins make them ideal targets for discovery of prolongevity compounds or aging interventions. This chapter will review the functions of sirtuins in aging and aging interventions related to sirtuins.									1	0	0	1	0	1					978-1-4419-0638-0	WOS:000273356700005

The antioxidant EC(50) values of the crude nutmeg oil dissolved in methanol were 2.4 mu L/mL and 0.4 mu L/mL, respectively. The former value was approximately equivalent to the free radical scavenging capacities of 462 mu M BHT and 656 mu M alpha-tocopherol, and the latter one was comparable to the inhibitive capacities of 43 mu M BHT and 9 mu M alpha-tocopherol against the oxidation of beta-carotene and linoleic acid. Further investigations discovered three major antioxidant constituents of the nutmeg oil (i.e., eugenol, isoeugenol, and methoxyeugenol), which were sequentially separated and identified by silica open column chromatography, HPLC and GC-MS. Their antioxidant activities in the DPPH(center dot) assay decreased in the following order: eugenol > methoxyeugenol > BUT > isoeugenol > alpha-tocopherol, while in the beta-carotene-linoleic acid assay, the antioxidant activities of the chemicals were in the following order: alpha-tocopherol > BHT > isoeugenol > methoxyeugenol > eugenol.					236th National Meeting of the American-Chemical-Society236th National Meeting of the American-Chemical-Society	AUG 17-21, 2008AUG 17-21, 2008	Amer Chem SocAmer Chem Soc	Philadelphia, PAPhiladelphia, PA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0097-6156		978-0-8412-2549-7	WOS:000292708300015

These cavities serve as nanoscale reactors for the synthesis of nanoparticles from a variety of materials. The membranes with embedded nanoscale semiconductors, still optically transparent, have been used as sheet-photocatalysts for energy conversion applications, while those with embedded reactive metals used as nano-energetic materials for hydrogen generation and beyond. This chapter provides an overview on the templated synthesis of nanomaterials in fluorinated ionomer membranes and the various energy-related applications of this unique class of nanocomposite materials.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0097-6156		978-0-8412-2610-4	WOS:000305161400007

Skeels] peel								FOOD CHEMISTRY				118	1			62	66		10.1016/j.foodchem.2009.04.073			JAN 1 2010	2010	Fruits of wampee [Clausena lansium (Lour.) Skeels] contain a significant amount of coumarins with many health benefits. The activity-guided separation of an ethyl acetate-soluble fraction on a polyamide column followed by silica gel column and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) preparation afforded a pure compound, which was identified to be 8-hydroxypsoralen based on the (1)H, (13)C NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance), and ESI-MS (electrospray ionisation mass spectrometric) analysis. This isolate exhibited good scavenging activities against DPPH radical and superoxide anion as well as significant reducing power. It also showed potent proliferation inhibitory activity against human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cell line (HepG2), human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line (A549) and human cervical carcinoma cell line (HELA). This is the first report on the antioxidant and cytotoxic properties of C. lansium fruit extract. The food and pharmaceutical industry could be benefited by the usage of this extract containing this constituent. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We are identifying genes involved in otogenesis, with the longer term goal of studying their mechanisms of action, leading to inner ear induction and patterning. Using Agilent microarrays, we compared the differential expression of a test domain (which consisted of the pre-otic placodal ectoderm with the adjacent hindbrain ectoderm and the underlying mesendodermal tissues) with a rostral control domain (which included tissue that is competent, but not specified, to express inner ear markers in explant assays). We identified 1261 transcripts differentially expressed between the two domains at a 2-fold or greater change: 463 were upregulated and 798 were downregulated in the test domain. We validated the differential expression of several signaling molecules and transcription factors identified in this array using in situ hybridization. Furthermore, the expression patterns of the validated group of genes from the test domain were explored in detail to determine how the timing of their expression relates to specific events of otic induction and development. In conclusion, we identified a number of novel candidate genes for otic placode induction. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Due to its recent development, this organizational phenomenon is complex and has many variables, making the process of choosing a research topic also complex for researchers and students. Thus, this paper aims to provide an analysis of the major topics studied in over 173 papers published about supply chain management in the most important international production and operation management journals between 2004 and 2006. The results show that the major topics are coordination, information sharing between companies, production decisions, and supply chain design and performance. Many topics should also be the focus of future studies until the supply chain management becomes a discipline.		A crescente importância da cadeia de suprimentos tem levado pesquisadores a desenvolverem um volume significativo de trabalhos sobre o tema. Ao mesmo tempo, devido ao seu recente surgimento, esse fenômeno organizacional é complexo e engloba inúmeras variáveis, tornando igualmente complexo o processo de escolha do objeto de pesquisa por pesquisadores e estudantes. Por essa razão, esse artigo tem o objetivo de proporcionar uma análise dos principais tópicos estudados em 173 artigos sobre gestão da cadeia de suprimentos publicados nos principais periódicos acadêmicos internacionais entre 2004 e 2006. Os resultados mostram que os artigos focam, principalmente, a coordenação e a troca de informações entre empresas, a configuração da produção, o design e o desempenho da cadeia de suprimentos. Além disso, também são destacadas as características de alguns dos principais periódicos internacionais. Diversos tópicos, ainda, precisam ser estudados até que a gestão da cadeia de suprimentos se solidifique como disciplina.							3	0	0	0	3	5			1806-9649			SCIELO:S0104-530X2010000100016

Owners can now deduct outright reforestation costs up to $10,000 per year for each qualifying timber property and amortize any additional amount over 8 tax years. To assess the financial benefit the new incentives provide to forest owners, the authors developed spreadsheets that calculate after-tax Bare Land Value (BLV) for a representative southern pine management plan under three tax situations: no reforestation incentives, the incentives under previous law, and the incentives under the current law. They found that compared to no tax incentive, the current law chiefly benefits owners with high non-timber income, increasing BLV by an amount equivalent to a reforestation cost share of roughly 25-30% as opposed to 5-15% for owners with low or median income. Compared to previous law, the current law chiefly benefits owners of large forest holdings, increasing BLV by an amount equivalent to a reforestation cost share of roughly 10-20%. For owners of small forest holdings, however, BLV decreased by an amount equivalent to a 5-10% increase in reforestation costs. These findings are significant as Congress likely intended that the new incentives continue to benefit primarily "small woodland owners" with modest incomes and forest holdings.									0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-60876-262-0	WOS:000281447700019

The second era witnessed the rapid expansion of the service field beyond service marketing. This era, described with the metaphor of social evolution, progresses through three additional stages: Making Tools, Creating Language, and Building Community. We expand on Building Community as the future of the service field with discussion of the state of Service Science, Management, and Engineering (SSME), the idea of adding service arts, the need to serve customers, and memes for building the service community. We envision a service field that is customer-centered, multidisciplinary and collaborative.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1865-4924		978-1-4419-1627-3	WOS:000277769000029

Of the 201 stories appearing in 1996, 2001, or 2006, 97 incorporated a public health frame (i.e., connects problem to the larger social and environmental context; exposes risk factors; includes information regarding preventatives and correctives). Significant risk factors were identified as unhealthy eating practices, lack of physical activity, and ads for junk food directed at children. Prevalent categories of preventatives and correctives focused on changes in diet, particularly in the home or in areas controlled by parents. Offered less frequently were suggestions regarding increases in physical activity. Consistent with previous research, the majority of both preventatives and correctives focused on individual-level as opposed to societal-level factors. Implications of these findings for the framing of news regarding childhood obesity are discussed.									16	0	0	1	0	16			1041-0236			WOS:000285146800010	21153987	
S	Moody, N. R.; Reedy, E. D., Jr.; Corona, E.; Adams, D. P.; Kennedy, M. S.; Cordill, M. J.; Bahr, D. F.						Bremand, F		Buckle Driven Delamination in Thin Hard Film Compliant Substrate Systems								ICEM 14: 14TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EXPERIMENTAL MECHANICS, VOL 6		EPJ Web of Conferences		6						40006	10.1051/epjconf/20100640006			2010	2010	Deformation and fracture of thin films on compliant substrates are key factors constraining the performance of emerging flexible substrate devices. [1-3] These systems often contain layers of thin polymer, ceramic and metallic films and stretchable interconnects where differing properties induce high normal and shear stresses. [4] As long as the films remain bonded to the substrates, they may deform far beyond their freestanding form. Once debonded, substrate constraint disappears leading to film failure. [3] Experimentally it is very difficult to measure properties in these systems at sub-micron and nanoscales. Theoretically it is very difficult to determine the contributions from the films, interfaces, and substrates. As a result our understanding of deformation and fracture behavior in compliant substrate systems is limited. This motivated a study of buckle driven delamination of thin hard tungsten films on pure PMMA substrates.The films were sputter deposited to thicknesses of 100 nm, 200 nm, and 400 nm with a residual compressive stress of 1.7 GPa. An aluminum oxide interlayer was added on several samples to alter interfacial composition. Buckles formed spontaneously on the PMMA substrates following film deposition. On films without the aluminum oxide interlayer, an extensive network of small telephone cord buckles formed following deposition, interspersed with regions of larger telephone cord buckles. (Figure 1) On films with an aluminum oxide interlayer, telephone cord buckles formed creating a uniform widely spaced pattern. Through-substrate optical observations revealed matching buckle patterns along the film-substrate interface indicating that delamination occurred for large and small buckles with and without an interlayer. The coexistence of large and small buckles on the same substrate led to two distinct behaviors as shown in Figure 2 where normalized buckle heights are plotted against normalized film stress. The behaviors deviate significantly from behavior predicted by rigid elastic solutions.To address this issue we developed a finite element analysis technique that employed a cohesive zone model to simulate interfacial crack growth. Specifying the traction-separation relationship, cohesive strength, and work of separation along with film thickness, film stress, and film and substrate properties, buckle width and height were determined as a function of interfacial toughness. The simulations indicate that an analysis based on rigid substrate solutions significantly underestimate toughness for prescribed buckle widths: a result consistent with an analysis by Yu and Hutchinson [5] that pieced together a solution based on non-linear plate theory with a solution for the linear film on substrate problem. More importantly, the results defined a lower limiting bound to seemingly disparate buckle deflection data (Figure 2). The substrate compliance is controlling behavior. Comparison of the experimental results with cohesive zone simulations suggests that the two buckle behaviors are associated with different levels of substrate yielding. In this presentation we will use the results to show how substrate compliance and deformation affect delamination and buckling of films on compliant substrates and provide a means to predict device performance.					14th International Conference on Experimental Mechanics (ICEM14)14th International Conference on Experimental Mechanics (ICEM14)	JUL 04-09, 2010JUL 04-09, 2010	European Assoc Expt Mech (EURASEM); French Soc Mech (AFM); Grp Adv Methods Stress Anal (GAMAC); Natl Ctr Sci Res (CNRS); Univ Poitiers, British Soc Stain Measurement (BSSM); Soc Expt Mech; Japanese Soc Expt Mech (JSEM)European Assoc Expt Mech (EURASEM); French Soc Mech (AFM); Grp Adv Methods Stress Anal (GAMAC); Natl Ctr Sci Res (CNRS); Univ Poitiers, British Soc Stain Measurement (BSSM); Soc Expt Mech; Japanese Soc Expt Mech (JSEM)	Poitiers, FRANCEPoitiers, FRANCE	1	0	0	0	0	1			2100-014X		*****************	WOS:000291704000275

IEEE					Image-Based Segmentation of Indoor Corridor Floors for a Mobile Robot								IEEE/RSJ 2010 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT ROBOTS AND SYSTEMS (IROS 2010)		IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems						837	843		10.1109/IROS.2010.5652818			2010	2010	We present a novel method for image-based floor detection from a single image. In contrast with previous approaches that rely upon homographies, our approach does not require multiple images (either stereo or optical flow). It also does not require the camera to be calibrated, even for lens distortion. The technique combines three visual cues for evaluating the likelihood of horizontal intensity edge line segments belonging to the wall-floor boundary. The combination of these cues yields a robust system that works even in the presence of severe specular reflections, which are common in indoor environments. The nearly real-time algorithm is tested on a large database of images collected in a wide variety of conditions, on which it achieves nearly 90% detection accuracy.

This paper explores the benefits of combining the two by addressing the problem of classifying unknown objects, such as found in service robot applications. In the proposed approach, an object lies on a flat background, and the goal of the robot is to interact with and classify each object so that it can be studied further. The algorithm considers each object to be classified using color, shape, and flexibility. Experiments on a number of different objects demonstrate the ability of efficiently classifying and labeling each item through interaction.

Participants used either real walking, gaze-directed, pointing-directed, or torso-directed travel to follow a target through an environment while simultaneously responding to auditory stimuli. In addition to travel technique, we investigated gender as a between-subjects variable and task difficulty (simple or complex) and task type (single or divided) as within-subjects variables. Real walking allowed superior performance over the pointing-directed technique on measures of navigation task performance and recognition of stimuli presented during navigation. This indicates that participants using real walking may have had more spare cognitive capacity to process and encode stimuli than those using pointing-directed travel. We also found a gender-difficulty interaction where males performed worse and responded slower to the attention task when the spatial task was more difficult, but no differences were observed for females between difficulty levels. While these results may be pertinent for the design of virtual environments, the nature and goal of the virtual environment tasks must be carefully considered to determine whether similar effects on performance can be expected under different conditions.

J	Shen, Haiying (Helen)								IRM: Integrated File Replication and Consistency Maintenance in P2P Systems								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS				21	1			100	113		10.1109/TPDS.2009.43			JAN 2010	2010	In peer-to-peer file sharing systems, file replication and consistency maintenance are widely used techniques for high system performance. Despite significant interdependencies between them, these two issues are typically addressed separately. Most file replication methods rigidly specify replica nodes, leading to low replica utilization, unnecessary replicas and hence extra consistency maintenance overhead. Most consistency maintenance methods propagate update messages based on message spreading or a structure without considering file replication dynamism, leading to inefficient file update and hence high possibility of outdated file response. This paper presents an Integrated file Replication and consistency Maintenance mechanism (IRM) that integrates the two techniques in a systematic and harmonized manner. It achieves high efficiency in file replication and consistency maintenance at a significantly low cost. Instead of passively accepting replicas and updates, each node determines file replication and update polling by dynamically adapting to time-varying file query and update rates, which avoids unnecessary file replications and updates. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of IRM in comparison with other approaches. It dramatically reduces overhead and yields significant improvements on the efficiency of both file replication and consistency maintenance approaches.									19	2	0	0	0	21			1045-9219			WOS:000272318700009

In this system, as components fail one by one, the total load or traffic applied to the system is redistributed among the remaining surviving components, which is commonly referred to as load-sharing. This develops parameter estimation methods for these type of systems. A closed-form Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) and Best Unbiased Estimator (BUE) are provided under a general load-sharing rule when the underlying lifetime distribution of the components in the system is exponential. As an extension, it is assumed that the underlying lifetime distribution of the components is Weibull and it is shown that, after the shape parameter is estimated by solving the one-dimensional log-likelihood estimating equation, the closed-form MLE and conditional BUE of the rate parameter are easily obtained. The asymptotic distribution of the proposed MLE is also provided. Illustrative examples and Monte Carlo simulation results are also presented and these substantiate the proposed methods.									12	0	0	0	0	12			0740-817X	1545-8830		WOS:000279442200005

A connected dominating set (CDS) of a graph is a subset S of the nodes such that the subgraph induced by S is connected and every other node in the graph is adjacent to some node of S. A CDS is suitable as a spine or subset for communication. We provide and analyze two versions of a self-stabilizing algorithm for creating a good CDS. The better version is based on the construction of a breadth-first spanning tree with large internal degree and then discarding the leaves.

This paper presents a closed-loop control of a robotic UV curing system by using thermal vision feedback through two infrared (IR) cameras. The proposed approach is developed based on a mathematical analysis of the fundamental UV curing process and the integration of the local and global IR cameras in a cascade manner. A computer simulation study is conducted to evaluate the proposed strategy by regarding two control variables: the radiant intensity of the UV heater and the sweeping speed of the robot end effector. The results indicate that controllers using either control variable can compensate for interferences and improve curing quality under this thermal-vision-based architecture.

In this paper, a finite in-plane shear deformation of auxtic honeycombs having effective negative Poisson's ratio is investigated over the base material's elastic range. An analytical model of the in-plane plastic failure of the cell walls is refined with finite element (FE) micromechanical analysis using periodic boundary conditions. A nonlinear constitutive relation of honeycombs is obtained from the FE micromechanics simulation and is used to define the coefficients of a hyperelastic strain energy function. Auxetic honeycombs show high shear flexibility without a severe geometric nonlinearity when compared to their regular counterparts.

The system consists of a piezoelectric cantilever unimorph structure embedded within an air chamber to mimic the vibration of the reeds in a harmonica when subjected to air flow In principle, when wind blows into the air chamber, the air pressure in the chamber increases and bends the cantilever beam opening an air path between the chamber and the environment. When the volumetric flow rate of air past the cantilever is large enough, the energy pumped into the structure via the nonlinear pressure forces offset the intrinsic damping in the system setting the beam into self-sustained limit-cycle oscillations. These oscillations induce a periodic strain in the piezoelectric layer which produces a voltage difference that can be channeled into an electric load. Unlike traditional vibratory energy harvesters where the excitation frequency needs to match the resonant frequency of the device for efficient energy extraction, the nonlinearly coupled aero-elasto dynamics of this device guarantees autonomous vibration of the cantilever beam near its natural frequency as long as the volumetric flow rate is larger than a certain threshold. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the ability of this device to harvest wind energy under normal wind conditions.

In MEMS applications, open-loop control is attractive as it computes a priori the required system input to achieve desired dynamic behavior without using feedback In this work, a 3-D computational electromechanical analysis is performed to preshape the voltage commands applied to electrostatically actuate a torsional micromirror to a desired tilt angle with minimal residual oscillations. The effect of higher vibration modes on the controlled response is also investigated. We show that, depending on the design of the micromirros, the first bending mode of the micromirror structures can have significant effect on the dynamic behavior of the system, which is difficult to suppress by using the step-voltage open-loop control. We employ a numerical optimization procedure to shape the input voltage from the real time dynamic response of the mirror structures. The optimization procedure results in a periodic non-linear input voltage design that can effectively suppress the bending mode effect.

An important feature in crash simulation is the amount of detail included in modeling spot weld connections. Traditionally for efficiency, simple node-to-node rigid (MPC) connections for modeling spot weld connections between different components are used in crash models, especially when many components are connected in a fully assembled vehicle crash model. In this work, different levels of complexity in spot weld modeling are examined: (a) simple node-to-node rigid connection, (b) rigid mesh independent spot welds, (c) elastic mesh independent spot welds, and (d) elastic mesh independent spot welds with failure. Mesh-independent spot-weld models define the location of the center point of the spot weld and define the spot weld radius on adjacent surfaces of connected components. A distributed coupling to nodes within the radius specified is automatically created which approximates the behavior of a spot weld of finite size. In order to study the fundamental behavior of different mesh-independent spot weld models, pullout and peal tests between two thin ductile steel plates are performed which isolate different failure modes. Comparisons of reaction force versus displacement curves and internal energy versus displacement for different spot weld models are examined. A case study of a front longitudinal rail for an automobile is presented to illustrate the behavior of the spot-weld models for crash analysis on a realistic and important automotive component which exhibits complex crushing modes with combined axial and bending and designed for strength and energy absorption.

In particular, an effort is made here to study the characteristics of a die cast automotive front seat backrest frame and develop a method for predicting the optimized material and support rib distribution which provides a lightweight seat which satisfies both strength and deflection requirements in a design space which includes the action of multiple load cases. An existing commercially available die cast backrest frame serves as the reference design space. Both 3D surface and solid models are created for representation as shell and solid finite element models for analysis. The objective function for topology optimization of the 3D solid model is to minimize mass of the component subject to stress and deflection constraints and is used as a guide in determining optimal geometric distribution of stiffening ribs. When the shell model of the reference seat is subjected to free-size optimization with this same constraint and objective given, an optimized material distribution measured by shell element thicknesses is obtained. For the topology optimization, manufacturing constraints of preferred draw direction and symmetry are applied in order to obtain an optimized material distribution which can be manufactured in the die-cast process. The procedure followed in this work generated an optimal material distribution and stiffening ribs in a lightweight die cast automotive seat backrest frame when subjected to multiple load cases. An overall reduction in weight of 13% is achieved over a reference commercially available die cast backrest frame component.

ASME					ON THE EFFECTS OF EDGE SCALLOPING FOR COLLAPSIBLE SPOKES IN A NON-PNEUMATIC WHEEL DURING HIGH SPEED ROLLING								IMECE2009: PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL MECHANICAL ENGINEERING CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION, VOL 13								685	697					2010	2010	The acoustic signature produced by non-pneumatic wheels with collapsible spokes is a critical design criterion for automotive and other mobility applications. During high speed rolling, acoustic noise may be produced by the interaction of vibrating spokes with a shear deformable ring as they enter the contact region, buckle and then snap back into a state of tension. In order to identify and help understand the causes of acoustic noise for a rolling non-pneumatic wheel, a two-dimensional finite element model with geometric nonlinearity has been utilized. The model consists of a shear ring modeled as two relatively inextensible membranes with high circumferential modulus separated by a hyper-elastic material. The temporal variation in spoke length as the spoke passes through the contact zone is extracted and used as input to a three-dimensional (3-D) model of a single spoke. The 3-D spoke model is able to capture out-of-plane vibration modes of the spoke which may contribute as a source of acoustic excitation and allows for modeling of edge scalloping. Natural frequencies and mode shapes of the various spoke design strategies are computed and correlated with the frequency response of the out-of-plane spoke vibrations. Results indicate that scalloping the edges of the spoke can dramatically reduce the amplitude of vibration, but does not have a strong effect on location of frequency peaks in a FFT of the time-signal.

B	Sill, Justin; Ayalew, Beshah			ASME					ON THE FREQUENCY DOMAIN ANALYSIS OF TIRE RELAXATION EFFECTS ON TRANSIENT ON-CENTER VEHICLE HANDLING PERFORMANCE								IMECE2009: PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL MECHANICAL ENGINEERING CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION, VOL 13								755	762					2010	2010	This paper presents an elegant frequency domain approach that can be used to analyze lateral vehicle dynamics for transient understeer and oversteer performance. Commonly used steady-state understeer analysis techniques are not able to expose some effects, such as tire relaxation, in on-center transient maneuvers. The approach presented here addresses such transient issues using a simple two degree of freedom handling model coupled to a model for tire lateral dynamics. In addition to the usual yaw rate and lateral acceleration transfer functions, this paper proposes using an understeer angle transfer function as an easy-to-interpret metric to evaluate transient on-center handling. Using the approach, it is shown that at low vehicle velocities, the inclusion of tire relaxation introduces dramatically different system dynamics by introducing highly undamped poles into the coupled system for both an understeering and an overstecring vehicle.

ASME					PROPERTIES, CHARACTERIZATION AND FIBER EXTRUSION SIMULATION OF NOVEL AMORPHOUS POLYMERS FOR OPTICAL APPLICATION								IMECE2009: PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL MECHANICAL ENGINEERING CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION, VOL 14								147	155					2010	2010	Polymeric optical fibers are generally manufactured in the same manner as traditional glass (silica) fibers. As technology advances, more efficient, cost effective materials and processes are being developed to serve the duties of optical materials within networks.Traditional polymer optical fibers are comprised of hydrocarbon amorphous polymers and include polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and polystyrene (PS). These types of polymers have inherent issues in optical applications such as their signal absorption loss. This is largely due to the vibration of the carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond contained in the polymer backbone.Therefore, to broaden the scope of polymer optical fibers, novel exotic amorphous polymers are being developed. One such polymer family, reported to have excellent optical properties, is perfluorocyclobutyl aryl ethers (PFCB), which do not exhibit the strong C-H vibrations associated with absorption loss. At this time, little is known of the intrinsic properties of PFCBs as well as the behavior of the polymer melt during extrusion.This work will review the thermal and rheological properties of two PFCB polymers: biphenylvinyl ether (BPVE) and hexafluoroisopropylidene vinyl ether (6F). The information gathered from the analysis of these two intrinsic properties will be used as the input data for a fiber extrusion simulation model, FiSim. The application of the FiSim software was done in order to produce a viable limited range of process conditions for which fibers could be melt spun.

Localization of Phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-Trisphosphate to Phagosomes in Entamoeba histolytica Achieved Using Glutathione S-Transferase- and Green Fluorescent Protein-Tagged Lipid Biosensors								INFECTION AND IMMUNITY				78	1			125	137		10.1128/IAI.00719-09			JAN 2010	2010	Entamoeba histolytica is an intestinal protozoan parasite that causes amoebic dysentery and liver abscess. Phagocytosis by the parasite is a critical virulence process, since it is a prerequisite for tissue invasion and establishment of chronic infection. While the roles of many of the proteins that regulate phagocytosis-related signaling events in E. histolytica have been characterized, the functions of lipids in this cellular process remain largely unknown in this parasite. In other systems, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP(3)), a major product of phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3-kinase) activity, is essential for phagocytosis. Pleckstrin homology (PH) domains are protein domains that specifically bind to PIP(3). In this study, we utilized glutathione S-transferase (GST)- and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled PH domains as lipid biosensors to characterize the spatiotemporal aspects of PIP(3) distribution during various endocytic processes in E. histolytica. PIP(3)-specific biosensors accumulated at extending pseudopodia and in phagosomal cups in trophozoites exposed to erythrocytes but did not localize to pinocytic compartments during the uptake of a fluid-phase marker, dextran. Our results suggest that PIP(3) is involved in the early stages of phagosome formation in E. histolytica. In addition, we demonstrated that PIP(3) exists at high steady-state levels in the plasma membrane of E. histolytica and that these levels, unlike those in mammalian cells, are not abolished by serum withdrawal. Finally, expression of a PH domain in trophozoites inhibited erythrophagocytosis and enhanced motility, providing genetic evidence supporting the role of PI3-kinase signaling in these processes in E. histolytica.									9	0	0	9	0	9			0019-9567			WOS:000272984300012	19901063

The purpose of this study is to investigate flow theory in understanding the impacts of virtual experiences of Second Life on people's travel intentions. Undergraduate college students at Clemson University were chosen as participants and data was collected in April, 2009, entailing 42 usable surveys. The study results demonstrated that the antecedents of flow and flow experiences in 3D virtual destinations positively associated with people's intentions to take an actual trip. By engaging in a virtual tourism destination site and experiencing enhanced flow, customers can develop consideration and awareness in their potential destination choice. More systematic research is needed to investigate the virtual experience and its effects on the traveler's decision making process.

The input sequence is from a commercial night-vision module dedicated for automotive applications. The text presents an in-house feature-level fusion routine that applies three fusing relationships; intersection, disjointing and inclusion, in addition to a new objects tracking routine. The processing is done for two specific night driving scenarios: a passing vehicle and an approaching vehicle with glare. The study presents the feature-level fusion details that include; a registration done at the hardware-level, a Gaussian-based preprocessing, a feature extraction subroutine, and finally the fusing logic. The evaluation criteria are based on the retrieved objects morphology and the number of features extracted. Presented comparison show that feature-level is more robust over variations in intensity of input channels and provides higher signal to noise ratio; 6.18 compared to 4.72 for the pixel-level case. Additionally, this study indicates that the pixel-level extracts more information from the channel with higher intensity while the feature-level highlights the input with higher number of features.

The interactive training simulation features a virtual instructor who teaches the trainee the Five Moments of hand hygiene, recommended by the Centers of Disease Control and the World Health Organization, via instructions and demonstrations in a tutorial phase. In an interactive training phase, a virtual health care worker demonstrates by interacting with a virtual patient and the patient's environment in ten randomly generated virtual scenarios. After watching each scenario the trainee evaluates if the virtual healthcare worker's actions are in accordance with the Five Moments of Hand Hygiene procedure. In a feedback phase, the trainee receives feedback on their performance in the training phase after which the trainee can either exit or return to any phase of the interactive simulation. We describe the design and development of the hospital environment, simulated virtual instructor, health care worker and patient, and the interactive simulation components towards teaching and training in healthcare best practices associated with hand hygiene.					10th International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVA)10th International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVA)	SEP 20-22, 2010SEP 20-22, 2010	Univ Penn, SIG Ctr Comp GraphUniv Penn, SIG Ctr Comp Graph	Philadelphia, PAPhiladelphia, PA	1	0	0	0	0	1			0302-9743		978-3-642-15891-9	WOS:000312453400013

Social Inhibition in Virtual Worlds								INTELLIGENT VIRTUAL AGENTS, IVA 2010		Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence		6356				454	467					2010	2010	What effect does controlling an avatar, while in the presence of other virtual agents, have on task performance in virtual worlds? Would the type of view have an influence on this effect? We conducted a study to observe the effects of social inhibition/facilitation traditionally seen in human-to-human interaction. The theory of social inhibition/facilitation states that the presence of others causes people to perform worse on complex tasks and better on simple tasks. Simple tasks are well-learned, easy tasks, while complex tasks require more thought processes to complete the task. Participants interacted in a virtual world through control of an avatar. Using this avatar, they completed both simple and complex math tasks in both 1st person and 3rd person views, either in the presence of another female virtual agent, male agent, or alone. The results from this study show that gender of virtual agents has an effect on real humans' sense of presence in the virtual world. Trends exist for inhibition and facilitation based on the gender of the agent and the view type. We have also identified several challenges in conducting experimental studies in virtual worlds. Our results may have implications on designing for education and training purposes in virtual worlds.					10th International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVA)10th International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVA)	SEP 20-22, 2010SEP 20-22, 2010	Univ Penn, SIG Ctr Comp GraphUniv Penn, SIG Ctr Comp Graph	Philadelphia, PAPhiladelphia, PA	4	0	0	0	0	4			0302-9743		978-3-642-15891-9	WOS:000312453400049

Genetic characterization using simple sequence repeats (SSRs) is a rapid and accurate technique complementary to morphological characterization. In this study, 27 cultivars (M. acuminate (AA genome), M. balbisiana (BB genome), polyploids and interspecific hybrids) were characterized using morphological traits and SSRs. From the SSR analysis, 2-11 alleles were observed, reflecting the genetic diversity among cultivars and hence an important reason for their conservation. Average linkage method (UPGMA) grouping of Musa cultivars showed some similarity to morphological grouping. 'Angaviaru' (AAB genome), 'Seenikesel' (ABB genome), 'Kolambaseeni' (ABB genome) and 'Embul' (AAB genome) were very diverse from the other cultivars. Wild 'Unel' (AA genome) showed less similarity to Sri Lankan cultivars than the other wild 'Etikesel' (BB genome). 'Ambon' (AAA genome), which was previously morphologically classified as a 'Gros Michel' (AAA genome), was actually closer related to 'Binkesel' (AAA genome, 'Cavendish' subgroup). Fertile diploids, such as 'Unel', 'Etikesel' and 'Navari' (AA genome), are distinct genotypes useful for genetic mapping and breeding. 'Muwanethikesel' (AAB genome), which has no male bud, is a possible mutant of 'Walsuwandel' (AAB genome). 'Alukesel' (ABB genome) and 'Etamburu' (ABB genome), which occasionally produce seeds, are also unique genotypes useful in banana improvement. 'Puwalu' (AAB genome), and 'Seenikesel' are superior genotypes with respect to bunch, fruit and yield characteristics.

Prototype objects are HR 4049 and the Red Rectangle. For most objects our infrared spectra reveal the presence of CO vibration-rotation lines and in some objects H2O vibration-rotation lines. The most extreme of these objects is HR 4049 where the 4.6 mu m spectrum shows a rich forest of CO and H2O emission lines of circumbinary origin. The presence of H2O lines confirm the oxygen-rich nature of the circumbinary gas which is in contrast to previously detected carbon-rich dust in many of these objects. Modeling of the line profiles suggests that the circumbinary gas is located in a thin layer near the dust disk. Modeling the circumbinary line profiles allows the masses of the individual stars in the binary to be derived. In the cases analyzed so far the supergiant has mass typical for a white dwarf confirming its post-AGB nature. The orbital parameters of these stars require a previous stage of common envelope evolution suggesting an origin of the circumbinary disk in the common envelope stage.

International journal of bioinformatics research and applications				6	2			101	19					2010	2010	An approach for module identification, Modules of Networks (MoNet), introduced an intuitive module definition and clear detection method using edges ranked by the Girvan-Newman algorithm. Modules from a yeast network showed significant association with biological processes, indicating the method's utility; however, systematic bias leads to varied results across trials. MoNet modules also exclude some network regions. To address these shortcomings, we developed a deterministic version of the Girvan-Newman algorithm and a new agglomerative algorithm, Deterministic Modularization of Networks (dMoNet). dMoNet simultaneously processes structurally equivalent edges while preserving intuitive foundations of the MoNet algorithm and generates modules with full network coverage.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1744-5485			MEDLINE:20223734	20223734

Structures were predicted using a homology modelling method. Folding and binding energy differences between wild-type and mutant structures were computed to quantitatively assess the effects of amino acid substitutions on protein stability and protein protein interaction, respectively. We demonstrated that pathogenic mutations at the interaction interface could affect binding energy and destabilise protein complex, whereas mutations at the non-interface might reduce folding energy and destabilise monomer structure. The results suggest that the structure-based analysis can provide useful information for understanding the molecular mechanisms of diseases.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1756-0756	1756-0764		BCI:BCI201200062726	21297231

The combined effects of population growth, climate change, and rural industrialization have led to greater demand for an increasingly scarce resource. Ensuring that communities have adequate access to water-an essential requirement for community health and prosperity-requires finegrained management policies based on real-time in situ data, both environmental and hydrological. To address this requirement at the state level, we have developed the South Carolina Digital Watershed, an end-to-end system for monitoring water resources. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of the core system components: (i) in situ sensing hardware, (ii) collection and uplink facilities, (iii) data streaming middleware, and (iv) back-end repository and presentation services.

J	Harrison, Jennilee; Klotz, Leidy								Women as Sustainability Leaders in Engineering: Evidence from Industry and Academia								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION				26	3	SI		727	734					2010	2010	Women are underrepresented in engineering education and practice, which limits the quality of the engineering workforce. One way to increase the participation of women in engineering is to emphasize subjects that appeal to them and require skills at which they are especially adept. A subject that may fit this description is sustainability. To examine whether the subject of sustainability may help increase the participation of women in engineering, the purpose of this research is to compare the percentage of women in selected sustainable engineering leadership positions with the percentage of women in general engineering leadership positions. Gender data were collected for the 'sustainability leader' at 79 of the largest design and construction companies in the U. S. Similar data were also compiled for engineering faculty attending workshops to share best practices for teaching sustainability. The percentage of women in the sustainability leader industry positions is much higher (39%) than the percentage of women in general management positions (8%). The percentage of woman attending the workshops is much higher (32%) than the percentage of woman engineering faculty (12%). Analysis of these results shows a statistically significant positive correlation between the subject of sustainability and increased percentages of women in engineering leadership positions. Increased consideration of sustainability in engineering education and practice could also help address the critical need to attract more women to the field.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0949-149X			WOS:000278764400023

There is growing acceptance of discipline-based education as a valuable research enterprise, on the same level as research into, say, mechanical engineering or organic chemistry. Evidence of innovative ways that discipline-based education programs are taking root in higher education include the establishment of cross-disciplinary departments in science, technology, and engineering education. These departments bring together faculty whose research area is education, who can tackle large-scale problems across the curriculum in addition to discipline-specific research projects. These departments seek to ensure that: 1) faculty engaged in engineering and science education research conduct rigorous, scholarly work, 2) education research is accessible and valued by faculty in 'traditional' engineering and science disciplines, and 3) the next generation of engineering and science educators will promote and apply education research. In this paper, we will review the details behind the formation of departments that include engineering education, specifically highlighting their roots, structures and purpose. We will also provide information on typical courses, programs and degrees offered by these departments, and career paths for their graduates. Finally, we offer examples of how the discipline of engineering education has been fostered at institutions without a dedicated department, such as centers and other 'hybrid' models.									17	0	0	0	0	17			0949-149X			WOS:000283515600004

Student-Centered Active, Cooperative Learning in Engineering								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION				26	5	SI		1097	1110					2010	2010	The Student-Centered Activities for Large Enrollment Undergraduate Programs (SCALE-UP) approach to instructional design was adapted with the goal of delivering more effective statics, dynamics and multivariate calculus instruction and integrated course curricula. Inquiry-based learning exercises were designed, incorporating material from statics and dynamics into multivariable calculus, and vice-versa, as well as integrating statics and dynamics into one course. The effectiveness of the revised course designs and activities were assessed using a mixed method approach. Student performance in these courses and in follow-on courses was used to measure improvements in concept retention. Conceptual tests (Statics and Dynamics Concept Inventories) were administered before and after semesters, and average normalized gains were compared with those for students in traditional learning environments. Open-ended questions on end-of-semester course evaluations assessed student perceptions of the course format. Results indicate increases in conceptual measures in statics with SCALE-UP, significant reductions in failure rates for students in the integrated statics/dynamics course, and reduction in time to completion of statics and dynamics courses. Additionally, anecdotal evidence demonstrates that students are continuing the patterns of peer instruction and positive interdependence, hallmarks of student-centered and active learning, in follow-on courses. Based on these research findings, faculty development materials were developed that concisely state the pedagogical underpinnings of the method, provide evidence of success in our courses, and identify key aspects of successful implementation of student-centered, active, and inquiry-based learning in engineering courses.

J	Fan, Xiaohu; Wang, Xi; Chen, Feng								Ultrasonically Assisted Production of Biodiesel from Crude Cottonseed Oil								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GREEN ENERGY				7	2			117	127	PII 920911502	10.1080/15435071003673419			2010	2010	Transesterification of crude cottonseed oil with methanol in the presence of base catalyst by means of low-frequency ultrasonic irradiation at room temperature was investigated to evaluate the effects of reaction time, molar ratio of methanol to oil, catalyst type, and catalyst concentration on the biodiesel yield. All the catalysts exhibited better activity at 6/1 molar ratio of methanol to oil, among which potassium methoxide demonstrated the best activity. In addition, the effect of ultrasonic frequency on the biodiesel yield was also assessed. The high yield for the crude cottonseed oil biodiesel under the ultrasonic irradiation condition was attributed to the efficacy of cavitation, which could enhance the mass transfer between the methanol and crude cottonseed oil. The present results confirmed the high efficiency and feasibility of using ultrasonic energy to produce biodiesel.									21	1	1	1	0	23			1543-5075			WOS:000277470900001		
J	Shi, Shangzhao; Hwang, Jiann-Yang; Li, Xuan; Sun, Xiang; Lee, Burtrand I.								Enhanced hydrogen sorption on carbonaceous sorbents under electric field								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				35	2			629	631		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.11.008			JAN 2010	2010	The effect of an applied electric field on hydrogen physisorption isotherm on carbonaceous sorbents was studied. Distinctive sorption enhancement was obtained by applying a positive electrical potential of 2000 V to platinum-supported carbon samples. The phenomenon was ascribed to stronger interactions between hydrogen and the sorbent. Theoretical studies suggested that, the interaction between hydrogen and neutral carbon is primarily the electrostatic attraction between the pi-bonds of the aromatic rings and the sigma-bonds of H(2), which is classified as van der Waals interaction and is weak However the interaction between electrically charged carbon and hydrogen might involve orbital interactions between hydrogen and carbon, an interaction stronger than van der Waals attraction. Experimental studies indicated that the presence of platinum would induce dissociation of hydrogen molecules in to hydrogen atoms. The easier accessibility of the atomic orbital might favor the electron transfer from the atomic hydrogen to charged carbon. (C) 2009 Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The complex interplay between heat-based cancer treatments such as thermal ablation and chemotherapy may require computational models to identify the relationship between heat exposure and pharmacokinetics in order to optimise drug delivery.Materials and methods: Spatio-temporal data on tissue temperature and perfusion from heat-transfer models of radiofrequency ablation were used as input data. A spatio-temporal multi-compartmental pharmacokinetic model was built to describe the release of doxorubicin (DOX) from LTSL into the tumour plasma space, and subsequent transport into the extracellular space, and the cells. Systemic plasma and tissue compartments were also included. We compared standard chemotherapy (free-DOX) to LTSL-DOX administered as bolus at a dose of 0.7 mg/kg body weight.Results: Modelling LTSL-DOX treatment resulted in tumour tissue drug concentration of similar to 9.3 mu g/g with highest values within 1 cm outside the ablation zone boundary. Free-DOX treatment produced comparably uniform tissue drug concentrations of similar to 3.0 mu g/g. Administration of free-DOX resulted in a considerably higher peak level of drug concentration in the systemic plasma compartment (16.1 mu g/g) compared to LTSL-DOX (4.4 mu g/g). These results correlate well with a prior in vivo study.Conclusions: Combination of LTSL-DOX with thermal ablation allows localised drug delivery with higher tumour tissue concentrations than conventional chemotherapy. Our model may facilitate drug delivery optimisation via investigation of the interplays among liposome properties, tumour perfusion, and heating regimen.									38	0	0	25	0	39			0265-6736			WOS:000279802300009	20377363	
J	Gandhi, Tejash; Rogers, William; Amirkhanian, Serji								Laboratory evaluation of warm mix asphalt ageing characteristics								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PAVEMENT ENGINEERING				11	2			133	142		10.1080/10298430903033339			2010	2010	Since warm asphalt technology is relatively new, there are no old pavements to study the ageing behaviour of warm mix asphalt (WMA). While several studies have been conducted to study the properties ofWMA, its ageing characteristics are yet to be evaluated in detail. This paper presents the results of a laboratory study conducted to evaluate the ageing characteristics of WMA. Laboratory-prepared samples were aged artificially in the oven to simulate long-term ageing and then compared with unaged samples. Results of this study indicate that the warm asphalt additives improved the moisture susceptibility of the mixes and the mixes containing Sasobit(R) exhibited lowered rutting. Also, Aspha-min(R) lowered the resilient modulus (M(R)) values of the mixes at 25 and 40 degrees C. The additives did not seem to have any significant effect on the moisture susceptibility or the rutting resistance of the mixes as they aged, but significantly increased the M(R) values of the mixes as they aged.									14	1	0	0	2	16			1029-8436			WOS:000272701200005

Laboratory investigation of the influence of warm asphalt additives on long-term performance properties of CRM binders								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PAVEMENT ENGINEERING				11	2			153	160		10.1080/10298430903197225			2010	2010	This paper presents an experimental analysis of the long-term properties of rubberised binders containing warm asphalt additives. The rubberised binders were manufactured at 10% by binder weight using five different binder sources and the binders with the additives were produced using two (i.e. Aspha-min(R) and Sasobit(R)) of the available warm asphalt processes. The rubberised warm asphalt binders were artificially short-term and then long-term aged through the rolling thin film oven and pressure ageing vessel procedures. Superpave binder tests were carried out on the binders using the rotational viscometer, the dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) and the bending beam rheometer (BBR). In general, the results of this limited study indicated that (1) the addition of the warm asphalt additives into the rubberised binders showed positive effects on increasing rutting resistance, (2) the rubberised binders containing the additives were less resistant to fatigue cracking at intermediate temperatures than the control rubberised binders (based on the G*sin delta values at 25 degrees C from the DSR test) and (3) the addition of Sasobit(R) represented a possible lower resistance to low-temperature cracking (based on the stiffness and the m-value at -12 degrees C from the BBR test) and the addition of Aspha-min(R) had a statistically insignificant effect on low-temperature properties of rubberised binders.									10	0	0	0	1	10			1029-8436			WOS:000272701200007

We employed the competing values framework to capture the underlying value orientations of organizational culture. Using survey data collected from 226 US manufacturing plants, the relationships between four culture types and 10 TQM/Six Sigma practices were examined via the structural equation modeling technique. The results reveal the differential effects of the culture types on the implementation of TQM/Six Sigma practices. The implications of the links between different cultures and different TQM/Six Sigma practices are discussed. While the relationship between TQM practices and culture has been the subject of prior research, this is the first look at the relationship between organizational culture and a comprehensive set of quality management practices including the new Six Sigma practices. The understanding of the advantage of each culture type should help managers achieve effective implementation of TQM/Six Sigma practices from a holistic perspective of both quality management and culture.

Despite SEM's increasing prominence in the field, leading scholars continue to call for a deeper infusion of theory into empirical OM research. To strengthen ties between theory and analysis in OM research, this study evaluates previous OM applications of SEM and identifies specific ways we can use SEM to advance operations management theory. Through judicious use of SEM techniques, we believe that OM researchers have the opportunity to confirm and extend existing theoretical frameworks. Further, we offer guidance on how to operationalise measurement models such that researchers accurately depict the causality of a construct. To demonstrate how to advance theory, we use an illustrative example of SEM in an OM context based upon data gathered from a survey of over 200 respondents.									9	0	0	1	1	10			0020-7543			WOS:000278647700001

Analysis of the Social Carrying Capacity of a National Park Scenic Road								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION				4	2			75	94	PII 916904607	10.1080/15568310802438940			2010	2010	Most visitors experience national parks using their personal automobiles, but what is the capacity of park roads to accommodate this use? A simulation model of a national park scenic road was built to explore the road's social carrying capacity and service quality. Current and potential future vehicle use levels were compared in the simulation against visitor-reported standards for congestion. Social carrying capacities for the road were derived from the simulation model results - both with and without an alternative management approach applied. These social carrying capacities suggest that traditional transportation planning concepts need to be reevaluated when applied to scenic or experiential roads.									5	0	0	1	0	5			1556-8318			WOS:000271893400001

Control of this emerging new class of robots has proved difficult due to the inherent complexity of their dynamics. Using a recently established full dynamic model, we introduce a new nonlinear model-based control strategy for continuum robots. The approach is applicable to continuum robots which can extend/contract as well as bend throughout their structure. Results are illustrated using a three-section, six degree of freedom planar continuum robot.					9th WSEAS International Conference on Signal Processing, Robotics and Automation (ISPRA'10)9th WSEAS International Conference on Signal Processing, Robotics and Automation (ISPRA'10)	FEB 20-22, 2009FEB 20-22, 2009	WSEASWSEAS	Univ Cambridge, Cambridge, ENGLANDUniv Cambridge, Cambridge, ENGLAND	5	0	0	1	0	5			1792-4308		978-960-474-157-1	WOS:000276878300019

S	Memmott, F. D.; Hassell, R. L.						Sun, SX		Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) Grafting Method to Reduce Labor Cost by Eliminating Rootstock Side Shoots								IV INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON CUCURBITS		Acta Horticulturae		871				389	393					2010	2010	Watermelon grafting methods vary from Europe and Asia and are based on efficiency, skill and needs. China mainly practices the whole insertion grafting method where as Europe and Japan employs the splice/slant-cut grafting method. These methods are not suitable for grafting production in the U. S. due to the intense amount of labor cost necessary to successfully produce grafted watermelon transplants. This paper introduces a modified grafting technique called the "cotyledon devoid" method. Both rootstock cotyledons are removed at time of grafting to eliminate any potential rootstock regeneration. By allowing the rootstock and scion material to develop, to the appearance of the second or third true leaf before grafting, (employing the complete removal of both cotyledons) grafting success greatly increase. Furthermore by removing the need to maintain an active root system by excising the root, hypocotyl energy reserves can be conserved to initially heal the graft union and then generate new roots as needed. Grafting was performed on ten plants in five replications using four different rootstocks: Lagenaria siceraria 'Emphasis', Citrullus lanatus var. citroides 'Ojakkyo', Cucurbita moschata x Cucurbita maxima 'Strongtosa', and Citrullus lanatus var. lanatus 'Tri-X 313'. All scion material was Citrullus lanatus var. lanatus 'Tri-X 313'. Rootstocks and scion material was allowed to develop conjointly to the appearance of the first, second and third true leaf whereupon both cotyledons were removed and grafting was performed at each respective developmental stage. A 65 degrees angle was cut below and half an inch below the rootstock and scion cotyledons respectively. Opposing cuts were matched together and secured with a plastic clip. Roots were subsequently excised from the rootstock at soil base and inserted into fresh media for rooting. Grafts were randomly placed inside a healing chamber for 7 days.					4th International Symposium on Cucurbits4th International Symposium on Cucurbits	SEP 21-26, 2009SEP 21-26, 2009	Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)	Changsha, PEOPLES R CHINAChangsha, PEOPLES R CHINA	5	0	0	5	0	5			0567-7572		978-90-66055-13-1	WOS:000313513500053

Jack] in the residential landscape of Miami-Dade County, Florida. Flush shoots (10 cm) were collected from ten orange jasmine hedges in each of the four communities (Doral, Coral Gables, Palmetto Bay, and Homestead). We did not detect any consistent pattern in the fluctuation of psyllid density over time in the four communities. The greatest densities of eggs (65.5 +/- 36.3 eggs/shoot), early instars (first to third) (87.2 +/- 47.8 nymphs/shoot), and late instars (fourth and fifth) (16.9 +/- 9.3 nymphs/shoot) were detected on 24 May 2006 in Palmetto Bay (egg) and Doral (early and late instars). The density of adult psyllids remained below two individuals per flush shoot at all locations for the entire sampling period. There were no consistent correlations between environmental factors (temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, and wind speed) and the densities of nymphs and eggs. Percent parasitism by Tamarixia radiata (Waterston) averaged 18.5% in 2006, and no consistent patterns were observed among communities and sampling dates. Ladybeetles, syrphid flies, and spiders were the most common generalist predators observed on the psyllid-infested flush shoots.									7	0	0	7	2	9			1523-5475	2153-652X		BCI:BCI201200567545

The initial GC unit was replaced with a commercially available PB interface that allows analysis of liquid samples via electron ionization (EI) mass spectrometry. The original EI source has been removed and replaced with a simple, home-built glow discharge (GD) source, allowing both molecular and elemental information to be obtained simultaneously. Nebulization characteristics were optimized with respect to liquid flow, nebulizer gas, desolvation temperature, and the ability to remove solvent by a two-stage momentum separator. Glow discharge source block temperatures and plasma conditions were optimized relative to the caffeine (test compound) responses. The optimized conditions determined in this study are comparable to work done on a similar type of GDMS in this laboratory. Comparisons of analyte responses for the EI and GD sources with the PB interface reveal caffeine detection limits of 34 and 15 ng mL(-1), respectively. The GD and EI mass spectra for caffeine are similar to those of prior work and the NIST mass spectral library. Analytical responses of 100 mu L injections varied from 4.7-9.2% RSDs for concentrations of 0.001-250 mu g mL(-1) of caffeine, creatinine, a tetra-peptide, selenium-methyl-selenocysteine, and Cs and Pb salts. Detection limits were found to be in the ng mL(-1) level with absolute masses ranging from 0.24-31.4 ng.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0267-9477			WOS:000283150100016

Conditioned Media Enhance Osteogenic Differentiation on Poly(L-lactide-co-epsilon-caprolactone)/Hydroxyapatite Scaffolds and Chondrogenic Differentiation in Alginate								JOURNAL OF BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE-POLYMER EDITION				21	11			1441	1458		10.1163/092050609X12518804794703			2010	2010	The biochemical factors that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation can provide a means of optimizing culture conditions to develop a tissue-engineered osteochondral construct. Thus, the objectives of this study were to determine the effects of chondrocyte conditioned medium ( CM) on the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) cultured on poly(L-lactide-co-epsilon-caprolactone)/hydroxyapatite (PLA/PCL/HAP) scaffolds and to determine the effect of osteoblast CM on the chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs cultured in alginate. In addition, the biomaterial's effect on MSC differentiation was also investigated. MSCs were grown in two groups: ( 1) on porous PLA/PCL/HAP scaffolds in osteogenic differentiation medium or ( 2) encapsulated in alginate in chondrogenic differentiation medium. CM was taken from one group and administered to the 'opposite' group in volumetric concentrations of 25% or 50% at each medium change. The osteogenic group samples that were administered chondrocyte CM showed higher alkaline phosphatase activity than the controls that were not administered CM. Additionally, the cells that were given chondrocyte CM had higher osteocalcin and sialoprotein expression than the controls. Samples in the chondrogenic group that were administered osteoblast CM at a volumetric concentration of 50% produced more sGAG than the controls. The aggrecan and Sox9 expression was significantly higher in the samples given 50% CM as compared to the controls. The study also showed that culturing cells in alginate, without differentiation medium, can produce similar levels of differentiation as cells that were administered differentiation medium.

J	Raghavan, Devanathan; Shah, Sagar R.; Vyavahare, Naren R.								Neomycin Fixation Followed by Ethanol Pretreatment Leads to Reduced Buckling and Inhibition of Calcification in Bioprosthetic Valves								JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART B-APPLIED BIOMATERIALS				92B	1			168	177		10.1002/jbm.b.31503			JAN 2010	2010	Glutaraldehyde crosslinked bioprosthetic heart valves (BHVs) have two modalities of failure: degeneration (cuspal tear due to matrix failure) and calcification. They can occur independently as well as one can lead to the other causing co-existence. Calcific failure has been extensively studied before and several anti-calcification treatments have been developed; however, little research is directed to understand mechanisms of valvular degeneration. One of the shortcomings of glutaraldehyde fixation is its inability to stabilize all extracellular matrix components in the tissue. Previous studies from our lab have demonstrated that neomycin could be used as a fixative to stabilize glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) present in the valve to improve matrix properties. But neomycin fixation did not prevent cuspal calcification. In the present study, we wanted to enhance the anti-calcification potential of neomycin fixed valves by pretreating with ethanol or removing the free aldehydes by sodium borohydride treatment. Ethanol treatment has been previously used and found to have excellent anti-calcification properties for valve cusps. Results demonstrated in this study suggest that neomycin followed by ethanol treatment effectively preserves GAGs both in vitro as well as in vivo after subdermal implantation in rats. In vivo calcification was inhibited in neomycin fixed cusps pretreated with ethanol compared to glutaraldehyde (GLUT) control. Sodium borohydride treatment by itself did not inhibit calcification nor stabilized GAGs against enzymatic degradation. Neomycin fixation followed by ethanol treatment of BHVs could prevent both modalities of failure, thereby increasing the effective durability and lifetime of these bioprostheses several fold.

J	Ward, Mark, Sr.								The Ethic of Exigence Information Design, Postmodern Ethics, and the Holocaust								JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION				24	1			60	90		10.1177/1050651909346932			JAN 2010	2010	Compared to ethics in technical writing, ethics in design has received less attention. This lack of attention grows more apparent as document design becomes ''information design.'' Since Katz discerned an ''ethic of expediency'' in Nazi technical writing, scholars have often framed technical communication ethics in categorical terms. Yet analyses of information design must consider why arrangements of text and graphics have symbolic potency for given cultures. An ''ethic of exigence'' can be seen in an example of Nazi information design, a 1935 racial-education poster that illustrates how designers and users co-constructed a communally validated meaning. This example supports the postmodern view that ethics must account for naturalized authority as well as individual actions.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1050-6519			WOS:000272107100003		
J	Zinzow, Heidi; Seth, Puja; Jackson, Joan; Niehaus, Ashley; Fitzgerald, Monica								Abuse and Parental Characteristics, Attributions of Blame, and Psychological Adjustment in Adult Survivors of Child Sexual Abuse								JOURNAL OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE				19	1			79	98		10.1080/10538710903485989			2010	2010	The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of abuse and parental characteristics on attributional content and determine the relative contribution of different attributions of blame in predicting psychological symptomatology among adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse. One hundred eighty-three female undergraduates with a history of childhood sexual abuse completed self-report questionnaires. Abuse characteristics were significantly related to attributions. Family- and perpetrator-blame accounted for significant variability in psychological symptomatology, beyond the contributions of abuse characteristics, family environment, and self-blame. Implications for research and treatment are discussed.									2	1	0	0	1	4			1053-8712			WOS:000207709600006	20390780

Attributions of Responsibility in a Child Sexual Abuse (CSA) Vignette Among Respondents with CSA Histories: The Role of Abuse Similarity to a Hypothetical Victim								JOURNAL OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE				19	2			171	189		10.1080/10538711003615020			2010	2010	Previous research suggests that similarity to a victim may influence attributions of responsibility in hypothetical child sexual abuse scenarios. One aspect of similarity receiving mixed support in the literature is respondent child sexual abuse history. Using a sample of 1,345 college women, the present study examined child sexual abuse history, similarity to victim, and attributions of responsibility to a hypothetical victim, family member, and perpetrator in a child sexual abuse vignette. Results revealed no group differences in responsibility ratings among respondents with and without child sexual abuse histories. However, among the 133 respondents with child sexual abuse histories, results indicated that similarity to victim moderated the relationship between vignette characteristics, respondent history, and responsibility attributions. Results suggest that similarity to a victim may influence ratings in a self-preserving manner.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1053-8712			WOS:000207709700005	20390786

This can mask heterogeneity of effects, making it difficult to identify subsets of the population for whom impacts might differ from a population average. The authors exploit the design of Mexico's Oportunidades programme to construct measures of the heterogeneous impacts of the programme on contraception and compare these with conventional effect estimates. They find that the latter, while probably reliable for particular types of effects, fail to uncover the substantial programme impacts on the poorest women in rural Mexico.									4	0	0	1	1	5			1943-9342			WOS:000294612900004

The ZRI metamaterials, which is composed of metallic grids with periodic square lattice and slices of medium, is placed in front of the conventional patch antenna as a lens. The design progress and results are presented and discussed. A prototype of such a designed antenna has been fabricated and tested. The measured radiation patterns and return loss of the antenna are compared with the computed results, and a good agreement is observed. The ZRI lens can maintain 10 dBi maximum gain enhancement compared to the conventional patch antenna from 11.5 GHz to 12.5 GHz. The measured results show that the patch antenna with the ZRI lens has an impedance bandwidth in the range from 11.70 GHz to 12.56 GHz for S(11) < -10 dB.									15	0	0	0	0	15			0920-5071			WOS:000279337000019		
J	Moreland, Jeffrey C.; Sharp, Julia L.; Brown, Philip J.								Lab-Scale Fiber Spinning Experimental Design Cost Comparison								JOURNAL OF ENGINEERED FIBERS AND FABRICS				5	1			39	49					2010	2010	Many statistical experimental designs are too costly or require too much raw material to be feasible for lab-scale fiber spinning experiments. In this study a four-factor response surface design is presented to study the fiber spinning process in detail at the lab scale. The time, cost, and amount of raw material required to execute the proposed design are compared to the typical completely randomized 24 factorial design used in fiber spinning experiments and also to a standard four-factor response surface design. Sample fiber data as well as analysis from a typical statistical software package is provided to further demonstrate the differences between each design. By designating some treatment factors in the design as hard-to-change, split-plotting is used to reduce the time, cost, and amount of raw material required to complete the experiment. The proposed split-plot design is faster and less expensive than a typical factorial design and has the advantage of fitting a more complex second-order model to the system. When compared to a standard response surface design, the proposed split-plot design provides the same second-order modeling capabilities but reduces the cost of the experiment by 53%, the total time by 36%, and the amount of polymer required by 24%. Thus, a split-plot response surface design based on hard-to-change factors is recommended in lab-scale spinning.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1558-9250			WOS:000276998400005

While the impact to group decision-making has been studied, its impact on collaborative activities such as design review has not been well investigated. An experiment is conducted to investigate the effect of (1) group familiarity and (2) information held in common among group members on design review effectiveness. The results suggest that information held in common among group members affects the group's ability to identify design problems during a design review. Group familiarity was not found to have a significant effect on most of the results of the design review activity.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0954-4828			WOS:000272848900006

Enhancing protein and sugar release from defatted soy flakes using ultrasound technology								JOURNAL OF FOOD ENGINEERING				96	2			270	278		10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2009.07.023			JAN 2010	2010	This research focused on the use of high-power ultrasound prior to soy protein extraction to simultaneously enhance protein and sugar release in the extract. Defatted soy flakes dispersed in water were sonicated for 15, 30, 60 and 120 s using a bench-scale ultrasound unit. The ultrasonic amplitudes used were: 0, 21, 42, 63 and 84 mu m(pp) (peak-to-peak). The respective power densities were 0.30, 0.87, 1.53 and 2.56 W/mL Scanning electron micrographs of sonicated samples showed the structural disruption of soy flakes. The particle size decreased nearly 10-fold following ultrasonic treatment at high amplitudes. Sonication at high amplitude for 120 s gave the highest increase in total sugar released (50%) and protein yield (46%) when compared with non-sonicated samples (control). Ultrasonic pretreatment was also carried out with and without cooling for temperature moderation. The heat generated during sonication had no significant effect on protein and sugar release from defatted soy flakes. The use of ultrasound can significantly improve protein yield and reduce the overall cost of producing soy protein from flakes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, these studies have been unable to dissociate memory reductions from losses in attention associated with tobacco abstinence. In the present study, the authors sought to determine whether episodic memory reduction is a primary effect of nicotine withdrawal during tobacco abstinence. Heavy smokers were tested when smoking normally and following 24 hrs of abstinence. Participants were tested with a recognition memory task in which items were studied under full and divided attention conditions. Forward digit span and backward digit span were also included as control measures. Withdrawal was associated with a reduction in memory performance that was independent of attention at encoding. The authors conclude that impairment of episodic memory is a primary effect of nicotine withdrawal during tobacco abstinence. Further research is required to determine if this is associated with continued use of tobacco and cessation failures.									7	0	0	6	0	7			0022-1309			WOS:000283887100001	21086856

The Thrill of Victory: Measuring the Incentive to Win								JOURNAL OF LABOR ECONOMICS				28	1			87	112					JAN 2010	2010	There is ample evidence that incentive-pay structures, such as tournaments, result in increased performance. Is this due to selection or increased individual effort, and is any increased individual effort caused by pecuniary incentives or merely thirst for the thrill of victory (TOV)? Prior literature has not separated the different effects. We look at performance in horse and dog racing and find that only horses, controlled by jockeys during the race, exhibit performance corresponding to pecuniary incentives, while both respond to selection and TOV. The results show that pay structures do matter.									10	0	0	0	0	10			0734-306X			WOS:000273398900003

Thus, the purpose of this paper is to detail experimental design options for conducting such tests in a manner that has the potential to yield results that have high levels of internal and construct validity.Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents a logical analysis of strategies for testing me:nation models so as to insure valid inferences about causal relations between variables.Findings - The most appropriate strategy for testing assumed mediation models is research that uses randomized experimental designs.Practical implications - Managers should base their actions on valid evidence about phenomena. More specifically, managerial actions should be predicated on research results that have high levels of internal, construct, and statistical conclusion validity. Thus, this paper encourages managers to base decisions about organizational policies and practices on well-designed experimental research.Originality/value - This paper addresses a number of points about issues involving internal and construct validity in tests of assumed causal models that have not been covered in previous work.									12	0	0	0	0	12			0268-3946			WOS:000287467900001

The semifluorinated PFCB aryl ether polymers were shown to be hydrophobic, but demonstrated complete wetting by hydrocarbon-based liquids. Upon the incorporation of F-POSS as a drop-in modifier at low weight percent loadings, the composite fluoropolymer spin cast films exhibited increased water in addition to hydrocarbon repellency as determined by contact angle analysis. Composite film surface characterization included SEM and AFM analyses which showed excellent F-POSS dispersion and increased surface roughness. Thermal properties of the blended films were analysed using DSC and this demonstrated that the incorporation of F-POSS did not affect the bulk matrix properties inherent of PFCB aryl ether polymers. This work demonstrated that optimized F-POSS PFCB aryl ether polymer blend formulations have potential use as hydro-and oleophobic materials for seals, fibers, and coatings.									25	1	0	1	0	25			0959-9428			WOS:000276152100010

The multilayers possess an ordered layer structure with tunable nanoscale periods of thickness. Systematic investigation of growth kinetics revealed unique underlying film growth mechanisms. The growth of the MMT and sol-gel ZrO(2) layers is strongly coupled. For fresh aqueous ZrO(2) precursors, the growth rates of sol-gel ZrO(2) layers on MMT surfaces as functions of time and precursor concentration do not follow the standard mass transfer or interfacial reaction controlled kinetic models. Furthermore, the growth of the sol-gel oxide layers on MMT surfaces is self-limited to a maximum thickness of similar to 50-60 nm. These observations suggest a surface-mediated growth of sol-gel oxide layers on MMT surfaces, and such growth is likely influenced or controlled by electrostatic interactions. For the aged precursors, the growth mechanism differs; the growth of sol-gel oxide layers is controlled by hydrodynamics and follows the Landau-Levich model. These new findings on detailed growth kinetics, which have been difficult to observe and quantify via the synthesis of more prevailing polyelectrolyte-based multilayers, significantly advance the general understanding of the layer-by-layer electrostatic assembly. Overall, layer-by-layer assembly of multilayers using sol-gel oxides, instead of polyelectrolytes, as both adhesive and functional components in the structure, is a new concept of nanoscale fabrication, which can lead to the development of a broad range of inorganic nanostructured films. The mechanical properties and potential applications of this new class of multilayers are briefly discussed.									7	1	0	0	0	7			0959-9428			WOS:000278275500025

Tb-L1 and TbL2 show lifetimes in the order of almost 1 ms at room temperature, good color purity, and high relative photoluminescence quantum yields. This makes them excellent probes for sensing temperature via measurement of luminescence lifetime. Probes Eu1, Eu2, Tb-L1 and Tb-L2 were incorporated into various polymer matrices to give sensor films for use as temperature-sensitive paints (TSPs). Eu (III) complexes have the advantage of being effectively excited by purple light-emitting diodes with their peak wavelengths of 405 nm. All TSPs based on these europium and terbium probes display good sensitivities to temperature, in particular, TSP based on Tb-L1 and Tb-L2 can show temperature lifetime sensitivities of -13.8 ms per degrees C and -9.2 ms per degrees C, respectively. Assuming a precision of +/- 1 ms in the determination of lifetime, this will enable temperature to be determined with a precision of around +/- 0.1 degrees C. This temperature dependence is the highest one reported so far for lanthanide complexes.									58	0	0	8	0	58			0959-9428			WOS:000280818000021

Composite films on glassy carbon electrode surfaces were deposited by a coating method, applying a drop of solution containing the suspended CNOs and filler, PDDA or Chit. Composites form relatively porous structures on the electrode surface and exhibit typical capacitive behavior, as well as excellent mechanical and electrochemical stability over a wide potential window, from +600 to -600 mV. The capacitance of the films is primarily related to the amount of CNOs incorporated into the layer of the filler. The capacitance ranges between 20 and 30 F g(-1) of incorporated CNOs. The composites also show a low relaxation time from resistive to capacitive behavior, therefore indicating that they can operate as capacitors in short time windows.									17	1	0	0	0	17			0959-9428			WOS:000281411000024

Matthew Liao's recent paper 'The Basis of Human Moral Status'. I argue that Liao's account both does too much and too little: it grants rightholder status to those who may not deserve it, and it does not provide grounds for offering such status to those who arguably do deserve it. Given these troubling aspects of his approach, I encourage Liao to abandon his 'physical basis of moral agency' account of moral status and instead adopt a position closer to a traditional 'speciesist' view.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1740-4681			WOS:000290934300006

In this paper, the same bulk-production technique was applied to the synthesis of significantly C-13-enriched graphitic materials, from which graphene oxides similarly enriched with C-13 were prepared and characterized. The results demonstrate that arc-discharge is a convenient method to produce bulk quantities of C-13-enriched graphene materials from relatively less expensive precursors (largely amorphous C-13 powders).									5	0	0	1	0	5			1687-4110			WOS:000283182600001		
J	Ellis, Scott C.; Henry, Raymond M.; Shockley, Jeff								Buyer perceptions of supply disruption risk: A behavioral view and empirical assessment								JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT				28	1			34	46		10.1016/j.jom.2009.07.002			JAN 2010	2010	As supply chains become more complex, firms face increasing risks of supply disruptions. The process through which buyers make decisions in the face of these risks, however, has not been explored. Despite research highlighting the importance of behavioral approaches to risk. there is limited research that applies these views of risk in the supply chain literature. This paper addresses this gap by drawing on behavioral risk theory to investigate the causal relationships amongst situation, representations of risk, and decision-making within the purchasing domain. We operationalize and explore the relationship between three representations of supply disruption risk: magnitude of supply disruption, probability of supply disruption, and overall supply disruption risk. Additionally, we draw on exchange theories to identify product and market factors that impact buyers' perceptions of the probability and magnitude of supply disruption. Finally, we look at how representations of risk affect the decision to seek alternative sources of supply. We test our model using data collected from 223 purchasing managers and buyers of direct materials. Our results show that both the probability and the magnitude of supply disruption are important to buyers' overall perceptions of supply disruption risk. We also find that product and market situational factors impact perceptions of risk, but they are best understood through their impact on perceptions of probability and magnitude. Finally, we find that decisions are based on assessments of overall risk. These findings provide insight into the decision-making process and show that all three representations of risk are necessary for fully understanding risky decision-making with respect to supply disruptions.

We propose two major sources of work-family conflict: the structure of work and individual mindsets toward work. Furthermore, we examine beliefs about the employer that can diminish work-family conflict. We test our hypotheses using data gathered from 126 IT professionals. Our model explains more than 45% of the variance in work-family conflict. Our findings suggest: (1) skill variety requirements increase work-family conflict, (2) work ethic positively relates to work-family conflict, (3) leisure ethic negatively relates to work-family conflict, and (4) professionalism has mixed effects on work-family conflict. Finally, we found that when IT professionals perceive high levels of job security and are satisfied with supervision, work-family conflict diminishes. The study concludes with implications for research and practice.									11	0	0	0	2	13			1091-9392	1532-7744		WOS:000274736400006

In peaches, roots are white when they first appear and then become brown with age, which corresponds to a number of physiological changes. We related root browning to nitrogen (N) absorption and respiration in order to provide a better understanding of how color changes as typically observed using minirhizotrons relate to changes in root physiology. The experiment was conducted on peach seedlings (Prunus persica cv. 'Guardian') grown in 30-L pots in a greenhouse. Brown roots showed lower respiration rates than white roots. White roots showed a higher 15N uptake than brown roots and higher concentration of N, potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe) and copper (Cu), no significant differences were observed regarding calcium (Ca), and zinc (Zn) concentration.									6	0	0	5	1	6			0190-4167			WOS:000273476300014

JOURNAL OF POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY				5	1			62	72		10.1080/17439760903435224			2010	2010	When asked to describe a courageous action they have taken personally, people overwhelmingly describe an action with a successful outcome (Pury, Kowalski, & Spearman, 2007). Study 1 replicated these findings in observations of other people. Fifty participants described a courageous action taken by another person and made parallel ratings to Pury et al. Participants in Study 1 also described actions with overwhelmingly successful outcomes. In Study 2, 152 participants rated otherwise identical scenarios differing in success of outcome and attribution (internal vs. external) for outcome. Successful actions were rated as more courageous than unsuccessful outcomes, although this effect was attenuated for external attributions. Thus, we suggest that successful outcome is an unarticulated part of implicit theories of courage.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1743-9760			WOS:000291742400006

The conductivities of membranes prepared with different NH(4)(+) compositions were measured in deionized water at room temperature and compared to those at 80 degrees C in a gas phase for various relative humidities. The liquid-phase conductivity decreased linearly with an increase in the NH(4)(+) composition in the membrane (y(NH4+)), with that of the NH(4)(+)-form having a conductivity 25% that of the H(+)-form. The gas-phase conductivity of the NH(4)(+)-form, on the other hand, declined by 66-98% relative to the H(+)-form depending on humidity. The conductivities of fresh membranes in the presence of gas-phase NH(3) at different humidities were also studied. The conductivity decreased with time-on-stream and reached the same conductivity at a given humidity regardless of the NH(3) concentration, but the time to reach steady-state varied with NH(3) concentration. The y(NH4+) at steady-state conductivity was equivalent for all the NH(3) concentrations studied. The kinetics of conductivity decrease was slower at higher humidities. The humidity and y(NH4+) appear to have a concerted effect on the conductivity. The quantitative conductivity data under practical fuel cell conditions should be useful for future fuel cell modeling.

The effects of several experimental parameters on the frontal profile, the breakthrough volume, and the equilibrium parameters were determined for each solute. The amount adsorbed at exhaustion of naphthalene and naphthol was also compared. The kinetics and thermodynamics were maintained at relatively fast flow rates/linear velocities (similar to 6-18 mm/s). Comparisons of dynamic capacity revealed that naphthalene was more retained than naphthol, in most situations more than five times that of the naphthol adsorption. This increase in capacity is most likely due to the multilayering of naphthalene on the surface of the fibers through pi-pi interactions between the solute and the fiber surface and successive layering of solute molecules. The extent of layering is a function of the flow, with faster flow rates (and subsequent shear forces) reducing the extent of adsorbate-adsorbate interactions. Although the overall loading capacity of the capillary-channeled polymer fibers is far below porous phases, there are a number of attractive attributes that support further development.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1615-9306			WOS:000274306800006	20091715

Through a critical evaluation of existing research, the aim is to highlight key issues and to present potentially worthy avenues for future study.Design/methodology/approach - In reviewing recent and past advances in the study of customers behaving badly, an overview of existing research into customers behaving badly and addressing issues of terminology and definition is provided. Thereafter, three perspectives that provide the most opportunity and insight in studying the darker side of service dynamics are outlined. This leads to a review of some of the research design and methodological problems and issues that are faced when rigorously studying these issues. Subsequently, the paper devotes a section to the provocative idea that while dysfunctional customer behavior has many negative influences on customers, employees, and service firms, there are actually some positive functions of customers behaving badly.Findings - A research agenda is provided that is believed to identify and discuss a range of projects that comprises not only insightful theoretical contributions but is also practically relevant.Originality/value - The paper identifies a range of issues about which managers should be aware and proactively manage.									43	1	0	0	0	44			0887-6045			WOS:000285072400002		
J	Lio, Y.

Thus, the Shewhart-type control chart performs particularly well when the observed process data come from a near-normal distribution. On the other hand, when the underlying distribution is unknown or non-normal, the sampling distribution of a parameter estimator may not be available theoretically. In this case, the Shewhart-type charts are not available. Thus, in this paper, we propose a parametric bootstrap control chart for monitoring percentiles when process measurements have an inverse Gaussian distribution. Through extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate the behaviour and performance of the proposed bootstrap percentile charts. The average run lengths of the proposed percentage charts are investigated.									6	1	0	0	0	7			0094-9655			WOS:000273915300005

Both solvent-to-pitch ratios (S/P) >5 and a positive retrograde temperature gradient of 380-330 degrees C at 70 bar were found to reduce significantly the amount of trimer+ oligomers in the overhead product from the SCE column. This monomer- and dimer-rich overhead was subsequently stripped of monomer with gaseous toluene in a second packed column at 380 degrees C and 1.5 bar to obtain an 80+ mol% dimer product with an overall yield, based on the original feed, of 30%. To our knowledge, this is the first reported fractionation of a dimer-rich cut from a petroleum pitch with a demonstrably low level of both lower and higher mol wt impurities. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J	Gandhi, Tejash; Akisetty, Chandrakiran; Amirkhanian, Serji								A Comparison of Warm Asphalt Binder Aging with Laboratory Aging Procedures								JOURNAL OF TESTING AND EVALUATION				38	1			57	64		10.1520/JTE101934			JAN 2010	2010	Warm asphalt has been gaining increasing popularity in recent years; however there are several characteristics about warm asphalt that are still unknown. While several studies have been conducted to study the performance of warm asphalt mixtures, aging characteristics of warm mix asphalt (WMA) binders are not known in great detail. This paper presents the results of a limited study to evaluate the aging characteristics of two WMA binders artificially aged in the rolling thin film oven (RTFO) and the pressure aging vessel and comparing them with binder extracted from freshly prepared and artificially aged warm asphalt mixtures. RTFO aging was performed at 163 degrees C and a lower temperature to simulate warm asphalt aging. Tests on binders aged in the laboratory and binders extracted from freshly mixed and aged mixtures indicated that the WMA binders extracted from WMA mixtures had significantly lower viscosities and G*/sin delta compared to binders extracted from hot mix asphalt (HMA) and binders aged in the RTFO at 163 degrees C (325 degrees F). This indicates that the lower mixing and compaction temperatures reduce the aging of the warm asphalt binders. Also, binders extracted from WMA had significantly lower creep stiffness values and significantly higher m-values compared to warm asphalt binders aged in the RTFO at 163 degrees C (325 degrees F) and binders extracted from HMA. Binders containing WMA additives did not have higher G* sin delta values, indicating that the warm asphalt additives do not negatively affect the fatigue properties of the binders. Gel permeation chromatography analysis indicated that the addition of the warm asphalt additives did not have any significant effect on the %LMS of the binders used in this study.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0090-3973	1945-7553		WOS:000273449500007

Evaluation of Engineering Properties of Rubberized Laboratory Mixes Containing Warm Mix Additives								JOURNAL OF TESTING AND EVALUATION				38	1			65	72		10.1520/JTE102319			JAN 2010	2010	Warm mix asphalt (WMA) refers to technologies which allow a significant reduction of mixing and compaction temperatures of asphalt mixes. From previous studies, it is observed that warm mix additives work in different ways, either in reducing the viscosity of the asphalt binder or allowing better workability of the asphalt mix at lower temperatures through volume expansion in the binder. If the technologies of WMA are incorporated into rubberized asphalt mixes, which are generally produced and compacted at higher temperature than conventional mixes, it is possible to reduce the mixing and compaction temperatures of rubberized mixes to those of conventional mixes. This paper presents a limited study that characterizes the engineering properties of crumb rubber modifier (CRM) mixtures containing warm mix additives. Six CRM mixtures (two of control mixtures and four of warm mixtures) were prepared using two aggregate sources and two additives: Aspha-min(R) and Sasobit(R). Evaluation of all mixtures included the following testing procedures: tensile strength ratio, asphalt pavement analyzer, resilient modulus, and resilient modulus after long-term oven aging. The results from this study showed that in general, there was no significant difference between the control and warm CRM mixtures for the properties evaluated in this study, indicating that the use of WMA technologies into CRM mixes is expected to have no negative effect on the mixture's engineering properties.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0090-3973	1945-7553		WOS:000273449500008

Sampling was carried out on replicate trees with the rootstocks selected based on industry importance and to represent a wide range or tree sizes. Ten-year-old cherry trees on Mahaleb. Gisela (R) 5, Gisela (R) 6 and Weiroot 158 rootstocks, and 5-year-old peach trees on Bailey, Cadaman (R), Controller 5, Krymsk (R) 1 and Lovell rootstocks were examined. Root distribution was determined using a soil core sampling technique. Tree roots were separated from the soil cores, assigned to one of three size classes, dried and weighed. Data were analyzed by standard analysis of variance to determine main effects and interactions of rootstock, sampling depth and location. Total root biomass distribution differed significantly among peach but not cherry rootstocks. However, differences in root mass were noted at the different sampling locations around the tree and depths in the soil profile. Most roots were located within the tree row and distribution of roots perpendicular to the tree row were primarily located within the herbicide strip. The degree of lateral root distribution of the five peach rootstocks was not proportional to trunk diameter or tree biomass. These results indicate that a relatively simple soil core sampling technique is sufficient to detect root distribution differences among rootstock cultivars.									9	0	0	3	1	9			1527-3741			WOS:000276633600008

A newly documented and significant Piedmont prairie site with a Helianthus schweinitzii Torrey & A.Gray (Schweinitz's sunflower) population. J. Torrey Bot. Soc. 137: 120-129. 2010.-This study documented and described a recently located (2003) and significant Piedmont prairie site (Troy Prairie) from Montgomery County, NC. From 2006-08 a complete floristic inventory was conducted. In addition, 75 quadrats (1 x 1 m) were sampled for species frequency, and 12 quadrats were sampled at 3 depths (0-10 cm, 11-20 cm, 21-30 cm) for soil chemistry to determine pH, and extractable P, K, Ca, Mg, Zn, and Mn. A total of 163 vascular plant species were identified, including 62 monocots, 97 dicots, three ferns, and one lycopsid. There were 57 (35%) graminoids and 39 (24%) Asteraceae. Of the Asteraceae, Helianthus schweinitzii (Schweinitz's sunflower) is Federally endangered, while Solidago gracillima and S. radula are both rare-listed for NC. Only five individuals of H, schweinitzii were found in this study of an estimated 100 in 2003. Eighty-seven (53%) species had previously been reported as occurring in prairie-like associations. Andropogon gerardii and Rubus sp. had the highest frequency at 48%. Troy Prairie is one of only three known A. gerardii populations in North or South Carolina > 0.5 ha. The site contains upland to hydric conditions, and 42 (26%) of the species listed were obligate to facultative wetland. The mean soil pH was very strongly acidic (4.9). Phosphorus, K, and Ca levels were low for all three sampled depths for both upland and hydric sections, while there were medium levels of Mg. A portion of the site is under current consideration for a highway improvement project.									2	0	0	3	0	3			1095-5674			WOS:000277756900011		
J	Kutty, Jaishankar K.; Webb, Ken								Vibration stimulates vocal mucosa-like matrix expression by hydrogel-encapsulated fibroblasts								JOURNAL OF TISSUE ENGINEERING AND REGENERATIVE MEDICINE				4	1			62	72		10.1002/term.219			JAN 2010	2010	The composition and organization of the vocal fold extracellular matrix (ECM) provide the viscoelastic mechanical properties that are required to sustain high-frequency vibration during voice production. Although vocal injury and pathology are known to produce alterations in matrix physiology, the mechanisms responsible for the development and maintenance of vocal fold ECM are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of physiologically relevant vibratory stimulation on ECM gene expression and synthesis by fibroblasts encapsulated within hyaluronic acid hydrogels that approximate the viscoelastic properties of vocal mucosa. Relative to static controls, samples exposed to vibration exhibited significant increases in mRNA expression levels of HA synthase 2, decorin, fibromodulin and MMP-1, while collagen and elastin expression were relatively unchanged. Expression levels exhibited a temporal response, with maximum increases observed after 3 and 5 days of vibratory stimulation and significant downregulation observed at 10 days. Quantitative assays of matrix accumulation confirmed significant increases in sulphated glycosaminoglycans and significant decreases in collagen after 5 and 10 days of vibratory culture, relative to static controls. Cellular remodelling and hydrogel viscosity were affected by vibratory stimulation and were influenced by varying the encapsulated cell density. These results indicate that vibration is a critical epigenetic factor regulating vocal fold ECM and suggest that rapid restoration of the phonatory microenvironment may provide a basis for reducing vocal scarring, restoring native matrix composition and improving vocal quality.

Ilia in these clades are distinctive when complete and articulated with the rest of the pelvic girdle, but when preserved as isolated and broken fossils they may appear superficially similar. Reliable identification of urodele ilia is further hampered by limited information about the basic structure and contacts of the bone and its variation within the clade. Here we demonstrate that the ilium is more variable among urodeles than previously realized and provide the first detailed inventory of features that are potentially useful for differentiating ilia of anurans and urodeles. Many of these features relate to differences between the two clades in the orientation of the ilium and its contacts with other bones and with soft tissues. Based on the results of our survey, we re-interpret the holotype and two referred ilia of Nezpercius dodsoni (Late Cretaceous; Montana, U.S.A.) as being from an indeterminate urodele, not an anuran as originally described. Additional examples of Late Cretaceous urodele ilia are documented to highlight some of the variation seen in fossil urodele ilia and to aid in the proper identification of such specimens.									17	0	0	14	0	17			0272-4634	1937-2809		WOS:000284888100003

Trombulak, SC; Baldwin, RF		Introduction: Creating a Context for Landscape-Scale Conservation Planning								LANDSCAPE-SCALE CONSERVATION PLANNING								1	15		10.1007/978-90-481-9575-6_1	10.1007/978-90-481-9575-6		2010	2010	Over the last 130 years, conservation practitioners have increasingly enlarged their view of the important spatial scales on which to base the development and implementation of conservation plans. For example, even though national parks have been an essential tool in the global conservation toolbox since the late 1800s, it is now well understood that critical conservation goals can only be achieved if parks are viewed as being connected to each other ecologically and embedded within a larger landscape that includes a diverse mixture of ownerships, histories, and uses. The tools for planning at these greater spatial scales, from both the natural and social sciences, are only slowly being developed, tested, and refined. This book represents a step in that process, bringing together lessons on a variety of perspectives - including history, economics, wildlife biology, computer modeling, and climate change science - on how to achieve landscape-scale conservation planning. Although the authors represented in this book primarily describe their work on conservation planning in Eastern North America, these chapters serve as case studies on how conservation planning can be successfully approached in landscapes anywhere in the world.									2	0	0	1	0	2					978-90-481-9574-9	WOS:000282707600001

Landscape-scale conservation planners need to dissect those 'threats' (human activities that have driven ecological processes beyond the range of natural variability) to understand exactly what anthropogenic activities are influencing which aspects of ecosystem pattern and process. This chapter reviews two aspects of land use/land cover change (disaggregated and aggregated transitions), and introduces other anthropogenic activities that are treated in more depth in other chapters (i.e., pollution, disease, and climate change) before describing an ecoregional threat assessment project focused on identifying, mapping, and forecasting 'keystone threats.' Keystone threats are those strongly-interacting human activities - e.g., land use/land cover change - that if captured and modeled with some degree of accuracy can provide insights into where and when to protect habitats. The chapter suggests that in more wild or pristine areas, pollution or disease may be keystone threats while land use/land cover change will be the primary driver of biodiversity loss elsewhere. Given enough information any of these threats can be mapped and modeled to assist conservation planners in making decisions.									1	0	0	1	0	1					978-90-481-9574-9	WOS:000282707600002

Environmental history and conservation social science, specifically qualitative methods are useful to uncover and reveal important information regarding the history of land use and place attachment in a particular region. This study used both tools with an embedded case study designed to examine an intense conflict related to a conservation initiative in the heart of the Appalachian/Acadian ecoregion. Primary data for this study came from interviews with 21 opinion leaders in the region. The data were explored using a three part conceptual framework; cultural memory, essentialized images and vernacular conservation. The findings revealed clear fixed points in time, cultural memory, that define the local narrative of place. Not knowing these may have caused undue conflict from misunderstanding between conservation planners and local residents. Evidence of essentialized images escalation of the conflict was found, and clear examples were found, that may have helped form a conservation initiative rooted in the vernacular of the place. Understanding these elements can lead to a better process and ultimately one that preserves the dignity of local residents while creating a resilient conservation plan.									1	0	0	0	0	1					978-90-481-9574-9	WOS:000282707600003

As a result responses to these threats increasingly use a systematic process to identify important habitat at large enough scales necessary to support biodiversity that is currently or potentially threatened by human activity. However despite the relative agreement regarding emerging best practices for identifying and ranking areas within an eco-region for conservation and the wide use of eco-regional planning and ecosystem management in both developed and developing nations, biodiversity and the habitats they rely on continue to degrade. In most cases, one of the major barriers to implementing these landscape scale conservation plans appears to he poor institutional coordination and cooperation (horizontal and vertical fragmentation) across eco-regional scales. This paper describes some of the common barriers to effective eco-regional governance which hamper the implementation of conservation planning efforts and proposes specific steps and conditions necessary for the development of eco-regional institutions, which are thought to overcome governance fragmentation. As complex and transboundary threats such as climate change, pollution, and land conversion increase, it is thought that without this transformation in governance, biodiversity will continue to decline.									5	0	0	2	0	5					978-90-481-9574-9	WOS:000282707600004

Seabirds typically nest in colonies and are long-lived species with low annual reproductive rates. Seabird breeding sites typically occur on islands or along coasts and as such are often at the boundaries of ecological or political zones. During the breeding season, seabirds cross a very distinct terrestrial/marine ecological boundary on a regular basis to forage. Even relatively 'local' species cross multiple jurisdictions within a day (e.g., state lands and waters, and federal waters) while pelagic species may transit through international waters on a daily, weekly, or monthly time-frame. Seabird life-histories expose individuals and populations to environmental conditions affecting both terrestrial and marine habitats. The wide-ranging and transboundary nature of seabird ecology also exposes these species to various environmental and anthropogenic forces such as contamination, commercial fisheries and climate forcing that also are transboundary in nature. Therefore, wherever conservation of seabirds or the management of their populations is the goal, consideration must be given to ecosystem dynamics on land and at sea. Because the jurisdiction of agencies does not cross the land-sea boundary in the same manner as the seabirds they are managing, these efforts are facilitated by multi-agency communication and collaboration. By their very nature and by the nature of the systems that they must function within, seabirds embody the complexity of wildlife ecology and conservation in the twenty-first century.									4	0	0	4	0	5					978-90-481-9574-9	WOS:000282707600008

We describe three examples that focus on benefits and challenges of (1) delivering GIS-based expert systems in stakeholder-based contexts, (2) integrating expert judgment and computer-based site selection scenarios, and (3) reaching expert consensus on delineating conservation planning areas across a diverse ecoregion. The examples highlight several important lessons. First, engagement of experts should not be simply about gaining approval. To maximize the extent of buy-in by experts, they need to be legitimately involved in the creation of methodology and results. Second, experts need to be distinguished in the planning process from stakeholders and local residents. While precise definitions are elusive and likely to vary from one region to another, a transparent methodology for assessing and weighting each group's input is important. Finally, the methods used for engaging expert participation need to match the experts' technological capabilities and conceptual understandings. While a lack of familiarity with certain aspects should not disqualify an expert from participation, it does highlight the importance of advanced preparation on the part of those facilitating the process. Beyond these more technical issues are those related to the social sciences of expert engagement. Social and qualitative forms of data are needed to build this understanding.									2	0	0	2	0	2					978-90-481-9574-9	WOS:000282707600011		
B	Trombulak, Stephen C.; Baldwin, Robert F.; Woolmer, Gillian						Trombulak, SC; Baldwin, RF		The Human Footprint as a Conservation Planning Tool								LANDSCAPE-SCALE CONSERVATION PLANNING								281	301		10.1007/978-90-481-9575-6_13	10.1007/978-90-481-9575-6		2010	2010	Conservation planning is aided by an ability to view spatially explicit patterns of landscape transformation that are both multivariate and mapped with a fine-scale resolution. The Human Footprint is one such measure of transformation, integrating information on human access, settlement, transformation of land use/land cover, and development of energy infrastructure. We used this methodology to develop a fine-scale (90-m resolution) map of the degree of human transformation of the Northern Appalachian/Acadian ecoregion as well as develop models to project changes in key dynamic aspects of this map - roads, human population density, and land cover change due to amenities development - to identify in a comprehensive and systematic fashion locations that are currently highly transformed or vulnerable to transformation in the future. Although more than 90% of this ecoregion exhibits less than half of the maximum amount of transformation seen anywhere here, several regions, particular around urban areas and within major valleys, are already highly transformed. In addition, under reasonable scenarios of future population growth and development, threat levels for several areas currently with low levels of transformation are projected to increase, providing conservation planners a way to prioritize current conservation action to proactively achieve conservation goals for the future.									5	0	0	3	0	5					978-90-481-9574-9	WOS:000282707600013

Habitat conservation initiatives that seek to reconnect patches using functional corridors are increasingly part and parcel of conservation planning projects. Numerous methods have evolved all based on similar of least cost paths, functional rather than structural connectivity, and landscape resistance. However significant differences in approach exist including whether a network of patches is considered simultaneously or as patch patch pairs, and whether the goal is to model spatially explicit corridors or movement bottlenecks. We review these approaches and then describe ecological connectivity modeling for an ecoregion using the graph-theoretic approach considering two different patch-node scenarios, at the ecoregion scale and apply a more localized connectivity modeling exercise for a subregion and a single focal species the American Black bear (Ursus americanus). We discuss the difficulties of attempting to model functional corridors for focal species over heterogenous landscapes, and the potential benefits of using 'naturalness' or Human Footprint surrogates for connectivity.									8	0	0	4	0	8					978-90-481-9574-9	WOS:000282707600016

The usefulness of using symbolic interactionism to understand the creation of these meanings is also assessed. Ten meaning-themes emerged (aesthetic beauty, lack of built infrastructure/pristine environment, abundance and diversity of coral and other wildlife, unique natural resource, facilitation of desired recreation activity, safety and accessibility, curiosity and exploration, sense of connection to the natural world, escape from the everyday, and experiences with family and friends), and evidence supporting the utility of symbolic interactionism was identified. Using these findings, researchers may be better able to identify place meanings and the processes that create them.									17	1	0	3	1	19			0149-0400			WOS:000277546500005

Cutting forces may increase or decrease depending on the combined contribution from the flank and/or crater wear. Quantitative understanding and prediction of cutting forces under both tool flank and crater wear conditions is of importance to cutting process thermal modeling, tool life estimation, chatter prediction, and tool condition monitoring purposes. Unfortunately, there is no adequately documented work to analytically study the combined effects of both flank and crater wear on cutting forces and investigate the associated underlying machining physics. In this study, a slip-line field based force modeling approach is proposed to capture the worn tool cutting mechanism under the combined effects of both flank and crater wear in orthogonal cutting. The proposed slip-line field and the associated hodograph are introduced, and the slip-line models for the primary shear zone, the flank wear land and each part of the secondary shear zone are discussed in detail. The model implementation procedure is also proposed in terms of the hodograph geometric relationship and the force and moment equilibrium in order to predict cutting forces of interest.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1091-0344			WOS:000275533300001

Cutting forces may increase or decrease, depending on the combined contribution from the flank and/or crater wear. A two-dimensional (2D) slip-line field based analytical model has been proposed to model the force contributions from both the flank and crater wear. To validate the proposed force model, the Bayesian linear regression is implemented with credible intervals to evaluate the force model performance in orthogonal cutting of CK45 steels. In this study, the proposed analytical worn tool force model-based predictions fall well within the 75% credible intervals determined by the Bayesian approach, implying a satisfactory modeling capability of the proposed model. Based on the parametric study using the proposed force model, it is found that cutting forces decrease with the increasing crater wear depth but increase with the increasing flank wear length. Also, the predicted cutting forces are affected noticeably by the friction coefficients along the rake and flank faces and the ratio of crater sticking region to sliding region, and better knowledge of such friction coefficients and ratio is expected to further improve worn tool force modeling accuracy. Compared with the finite element approach, the proposed analytical approach is efficient and easy to extend to three-dimensional worn tool cutting configurations.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1091-0344			WOS:000275533300002

Micro crystallizations were observed at the fused region on the fused region and the taper region of polarization maintaining fiber devices with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The amount and size of the micro crystallizations are increased with decreasing drawing speed and their distribution is asymmetry along the fiber axis. Moreover, micro cracks were observed only at the taper region. The micro cracks became broader and deeper with increasing drawing speed and their distribution is also asymmetry along the fiber axis. The asymmetry of these microstructures is the primary reason that results in micro torsion during the fabrication process of polarization maintaining fiber devices and further deteriorates the optical performance, especially extinction ratio.

The objective of this research was to investigate the laboratory engineering behavior characteristics of the rubberized asphalt binders and mixtures made with PG 64-22 and a softer binder (PG 52-28) containing a high percentage of RAP (30%). Some of the testing used for this research included viscosity, dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), bending beam rheometer (BBR), indirect tensile strength (ITS), resilient modulus, and fatigue life evaluations. The experimental design included the use of two aggregate and RAP sources, two virgin binder grades (PG 64-22 and PG 52-28), two types of crumb rubber (ambient and cryogenic), and four rubber contents (0%, 5%, 10%, and 15%). The results indicated that: (1) the crumb rubber improved the aging resistance of the aged binder and prolonged the fatigue life of the mixtures containing 0% RAP, in addition, results indicated a decrease of ITS and resilient modulus values was found as the rubber content increased, regardless of rubber type; (2) the utilization of softer binder decreased the influence of aged binder and decreased the resilient modulus values of the mixtures. In most cases, regardless of rubber types, the rubberized mixtures containing 30% RAP made with PG 52-28 binder did not show a significant increase in fatigue life with those made with PG 64-22 binder.									11	3	0	1	0	13			1359-5997			WOS:000272318000017

The aim of this study is to show a novel accurate algorithm for the computer-based automated tracing of CCA in longitudinal B-Mode ultrasound images.One hundred ultrasound B-Mode longitudinal images of the CCA were processed to delineate the region of interest containing the artery. The algorithm is based on geometric feature extraction, line fitting, and classification. Output of the algorithm is the tracings of the near and far adventitia layers. Performance of the algorithm was validated against human tracings (ground truth) and benchmarked with a previously developed automated technique.Ninety-eight images were correctly processed, resulting in an overall system error (with respect to ground truth) equal to 0.18 +/- 0.17 mm (near adventitia) and 0.17 +/- 0.24 mm (far adventitia). In far adventitia detection, our novel technique outperformed the current standard method, which showed overall system errors equal to 0.07 +/- 0.07 mm and 0.49 +/- 0.27 mm for near and far adventitia, respectively. We also showed that our new technique is quite insensitive to noise and has performance independent on the subset of images used for training the classifiers.Superior architecture of this methodology could constitute a general basis for the development of completely automatic CCA segmentation strategies.

The methods are compared based on loading percentages (i.e. 100% loading would be equal to 2 Mn+: 1 Tf) determined for Cr3+ loading into apo-transferrin. Spectral interferences and overlapping LMCT bands cause inaccurate chromium (qualitative) and iron (qualitative and quantitative) results for the UV-VIS absorbance method. The ICP-OES and PB/HC-OES methods are in good agreement providing evidence that the PB/HC-OES method is a valid technique for investigating metal-protein complexes. Maximum Cr3+ loading into apo-transferrin over a 24 h period was determined to be 26.8 +/- 3.5% by the ICP-OES method and 25.3 +/- 2.2% by the PB/HC-OES method. Loading percentages were increased to 49.7 +/- 1.9% (ICP-OES) and 55.7 +/- 3.2% (PB/HC-OES) when the metal-transferrin solution was allowed to incubate for up to 10 days. Under non-excess carbonate conditions the Cr3+ loading is elevated over a 24 h incubation time, but under physiological conditions the loading is inhibited. Equal loading of Fe3+ and Cr3+ into apo-transferrin was achieved when chromium was at a level more than 5 times in excess of iron. Inhibition of Cr3+ loading was only observed when an excess of Fe3+ was available to bind into apo-transferrin. The ability for Cr3+ to displace Fe3+ from holo-transferrin was observed as small amounts of Cr3+ were loaded into the once occupied metal binding site.									8	0	0	7	0	8			1756-5901			WOS:000285101000001	21510013

We analyze administrative data from Pennsylvania prisons, with high-quality information on nativity and demographic characteristics. The latter allow us to construct incarceration rates for detailed population groups using U.S. Census data. The raw gap in incarceration rates for the foreign and native born is large, in accord with the extremely high concern at the time about immigrant criminality. But adjusting for age and gender greatly narrows that observed gap. Particularly striking are the urban/rural differences. Immigrants were concentrated in large cities where reported crime rates were higher. However, within rural counties, the foreign born had much higher incarceration rates than the native born. The interaction of nativity with urban residence explains much of the observed aggregate differentials in incarceration rates. Finally, we find that the foreign born, especially the Irish, consistently have higher incarceration rates for violent crimes, but from 1850 to 1860 the natives largely closed the gap with the foreign born for property offenses.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1574-8715		978-0-85724-153-5	WOS:000299848000013

To determine if a frequency band is in use, spectrum sensing techniques (e.g., energy detection, feature detection) are employed by the secondary radios. Such techniques require that the secondary radios cease transmitting in the band during spectrum sensing periods. We propose a technique whereby cognitive radios that are secondary users of a frequency band can monitor the band for the emergence of primary signals while communicating. This enhancement permits more efficient use of spectrum by the secondary network, which results in increased channel utilization.

S	Juang, Michael A.; Pursley, Michael B.			IEEE					Adaptation of Modulation and Coding for OFDM Packet Transmission								MILITARY COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE, 2010 (MILCOM 2010)		IEEE Military Communications Conference						1613	1618					2010	2010	A novel protocol is proposed for adaptive modulation and coding for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in packet radio networks. Previous protocols in the literature rely on channel measurements or parameter estimates to provide channel state information, which is then processed to determine the appropriate transmission parameters. Our proposed protocols avoid the complexity of making measurements or estimates; instead, we use simple statistics that are derived easily from the receiver's demodulator and decoder. Employing only these simple statistics from the reception of the most recent packet, our protocol first determines the code rate for the next packet and then selects the modulation format to be used on each subcarrier. The throughput results for our adaptive OFDM transmission protocol are obtained analytically and by simulation.

The effect of the processor's fixed-point resolution on the decoder performance is determined, and a simple technique is described for minimizing the performance penalty incurred when using the (highest throughput) lowest-resolution arithmetic mode of the processor. A reordering of the decoder schedule and a modification of the parity checks are also considered which permit increased software pipelining and improved latency hiding, with a corresponding increase in the data throughput. The fixed-point Storm-1 stream processor is used for comparative throughput results.

The networks we investigate employ frequency-agile radios that are able to change their carrier frequency and chip rate over a wide range of possibilities. These protocols have the capability to increase the network performance of an ad hoc network by utilizing the multiple bands available to the network. We show that our jointly designed channel-access and routing protocols significantly increase network performance over an approach in which the channel-access and routing protocols are not designed to cooperate. We also show that the channel-access and routing protocols should be adapted jointly according to the specific characteristics of the network.

Many bacteria express adhesins on their surfaces in the form of specialized organelles that seek and bind to cognate receptors on the surface of mucosal cells. Some of these specific receptors have been reported and many of them are carbohydrates in nature. We have explored the use of specific carbohydrate receptors for the functionalization of nanoparticles and demonstrated their binding specificities and their ability to mediate aggregations of targeted bacteria. Based on these binding specificities, here we report the development of adhensin-specific nanomechanical cantilever (microcantilever) biosensors for the detection of their targeted microorganisms.

This electrokinetic focusing eliminates sheath flows and in-channel microeleetrodes. It results from the cross-stream dielectrophoretic motion of cells induced by the intrinsic channel curvatures.

Fewer studies describing the biogeographic responses of marine species to the LGM have been conducted, but existing genetic data from coastal marine species indicate that fewer taxa show clear signatures of post-LGM recolonization. We have assembled a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data set for 14 co-distributed northeastern Pacific rocky-shore species from four phyla by combining new sequences from ten species with previously published sequences from eight species. Nuclear sequences from four species were retrieved from GenBank, plus we gathered new elongation factor 1-alpha sequences from the barnacle Balanus glandula. Results from demographic analyses of mtDNA for five (36%) species (Evasterias troschelii, Pisaster ochraceus, Littorina sitkana, L. scutulata, Xiphister mucosus) were consistent with large population expansions occurring near the LGM, a pattern expected if these species recently recolonized the region. However, seven (50%) species (Mytilus trossulus, M. californianus, B. glandula, S. cariosus, Patiria miniata, Katharina tunicata, X. atropurpureus) exhibited histories consistent with long-term stability in effective population size, a pattern indicative of regional persistence during the LGM. Two species of Nucella with significant mtDNA genetic structure showed spatially variable demographic histories. Multilocus analyses for five species were largely consistent with mtDNA: the majority of multilocus interpopulation divergence times significantly exceeded the LGM. Our results indicate that the LGM did not extirpate the majority of species in the northeastern Pacific; instead, regional persistence during the LGM appears a common biogeographic history for rocky-shore organisms in this region.									100	0	0	98	0	101			0962-1083			WOS:000273005800015	20092033

As fluorescent tags, conjugated polymer nanoparticles possess a number of advantageous properties, such as small particle size, extraordinary fluorescence brightness, excellent photostability, and high emission rate. Exciton diffusion occurring in the nanoparticles results in amplified energy transfer, doubling the energy transfer efficiency in some cases. Amplified energy transfer has been exploited to obtain highly red-shifted emission, oxygen-sensing nanoparticles, and fluorescence photoswitching. Additional observed phenomena are attributable to amplified energy transfer in conjugated polymers, including superquenching by metal nanoparticles, and fluorescence modulation by hole polarons. This feature article presents an overview of recent investigations of optical properties and energy transfer phenomena of this relatively novel type of fluorescent nanoparticle with a viewpoint towards demanding fluorescence-based imaging and sensing applications.									111	1	0	13	0	112			2040-3364			WOS:000282686200013	20697652

The molecular basis of floral bud chilling requirement is poorly understood, despite its importance to the adaptation and production of fruit trees. In addition, the genetic nature of heat requirement and the genetic interrelationships among chilling requirement, heat requirement and bloom date remain unclear.A peach (Prunus persica) F(2) population of 378 genotypes developed from two genotypes with contrasting chilling requirements was used for linkage map construction and quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. The floral bud chilling and heat requirements of each genotype were evaluated over 2 yr and the bloom date was scored over 4 yr.Twenty QTLs with additive effects were identified for three traits, including one major QTL for chilling requirement and two major QTLs for bloom date. The majority of QTLs colocalized with QTLs for other trait(s). In particular, one genomic region of 2 cM, pleiotropic for the three traits, overlapped with the sequenced peach EVG region.This first report on the QTL mapping of floral bud chilling requirement will facilitate marker-assisted breeding for low chilling requirement cultivars and the map-based cloning of genes controlling chilling requirement. The extensive colocalization of QTLs suggests that there may be one unified temperature sensing and action system regulating chilling requirement, heat requirement and bloom date together.									75	1	0	73	3	78			0028-646X			WOS:000274412400012	20028471

The Transcultural Self-Efficacy Tool was used to evaluate self-perceived cultural competence in a convenience sample of 60 baccalaureate nursing students enrolled in a community health nursing course following the completion of service-learning projects with local and international communities. Pre- and posttests were analyzed based on total scores and subscale (cognitive, practical, and affective) scores. A paired-samples t test compared the mean pretest total score to the mean posttest total score, which demonstrated a significant increase. In addition, paired-samples t tests demonstrated a significant increase in each subscale.									29	0	0	2	0	29			1536-5026			MEDLINE:20397475	20397475

The mode of action in humans is still not clear. Using microarray technology, we have compared the ethanol extracts of two different lingzhi (red lingzhi, G. lucidum; and purple lingzhi, G. sinense) for their effects on gene expression profile in human monocytic cells. Our results suggest that at best approximate to 25% of target genes are common to the two lingzhi: functionally ranging from cell development, negative regulation of cellular process, and cellular protein metabolic process to signal transduction and transcription. The pathways mediated by purple lingzhi focus on inflammation and immune response, whereas red lingzhi modestly increases levels of expression for genes involved in macromolecule metabolism. Furthermore, our ethanolic extracts of both red and purple lingzhi do not inhibit monocytic cell growth. The extract of red lingzhi does not have significant effect on the genes in the nuclear factor kappa B (NFB) pathway (an important inflammation pathway), whereas the extract of purple lingzhi can increase multiple key genes in the NFB pathway. Altogether, our results suggest that the common mode of action for lingzhi is complex; and different species of Ganoderma can modulate different pathways in human cells.									5	1	0	3	0	6			0163-5581			WOS:000279120100011	20574926

Among the many barriers that discourage participation are weight-related stigmas. The primary purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between consciousnesses of weight-related stigma and perceived competence in physical activity. A secondary purpose of the study was to explore the potential mediation effects of body esteem and body mass index (BMI) on the relationship. Consciousness of weight stigma, body esteem, and BMI are explored as predictors of perceived competence in physical activity. Methods: Participants included 76 adults who were enrolled in a weight management program. Data were collected using self-administered questionnaires. Path modeling was used to assess the relationships between stigma consciousness and perceived physical activity competence, and the potential mediation effects of BMI and body esteem. Results: Tests indicated that body esteem, but not BMI, mediated the relationship of consciousness of weight-related stigma and perceived physical activity competence. Conclusions: Consciousness of weight stigma, regardless of objective weight status, may negatively affect individuals' willingness to participate in physical activity. Findings such as these are important in furthering understanding the factors that affect behavior, and subsequently conducting programs to overcome perceptions of weight and physical activity to encourage participation.									26	0	0	4	2	26			1662-4025			WOS:000275346700003	20215791

Statistical significance (p <= 0.05) was identified in 7 of 10 statements when patient groups were compared. Provider responses indicated agreement with all five statements included in the Survey.Conclusions: Patients with cancer and oncology staff reported that patient navigation is effective in increasing patient satisfaction and decreasing barriers to care.Implications for Nursing: Patient navigation is an emerging trend in cancer care. Patient navigators can play a significant role in assisting patients with coordinating services across the continuum of care. Continued research is essential in refining the role and eminence of patient navigators.									42	0	0	6	0	43			0190-535X			WOS:000273623700006	20044340

Indeed, the low-cost high-through-put fiberization of crystalline materials could permit a step-jump in performance critical for use in high energy laser, infrared counter-measure, communication, and sensor systems. Further, the high degree of crystallinity is of considerable scientific value since optical fiber fabrication is a highly non-equilibrium process and so achieving high degrees of crystallinity is very counter-intuitive and offers new insight into crystal growth mechanisms.

A reference Michelson interferometer is used to compensate for the optical path difference and mismatch of dispersion and polarization states due to the miniaturized probe. This configuration allows arbitrary probe fiber length and provides sufficient working space for imaging optics and their package, and thus is suitable for OCT imaging of lumens of various sizes. Additionally, the reference intensity is able to be tuned by index match oil to optimize the signal to noise ratio of the system. Due to this common-path configuration, the OCT signal is immune to the bending or handling of the fiber connecting with the probe.

With the emergence of click reactions, particularly the copper(I) catalyzed version of Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition between azides and alkynes, new pathways to functionalize the particle surface in aqueous environments have opened for researchers to explore. In colloidal systems synthesized by free radical polymerization with monomers containing azides or alkynes, networked polymers are produced due to the bifunctionality of both monomers. The primary means of characterizing the success of these reactions due to the rigidity of the crosslinked particle is the use of a chromophore as the "clicked' material or titrations of a weak acid that has been "clicked'. Herein, the piecewise process of building a core-shell particle is described that avoids the unwanted crosslinking of an alkyne containing monomer. Due to the control of the piecewise fabrication, the polymer shell can removed with a favorable solvent pre- or post-functionalization with an azide-functionalized anthracene molecule.

Nelson, RL; Kajzar, F; Kaino, T		Comparative study on the effect of thermal annealing on polymer/small molecule blend and copolymer organic light emitting devices								ORGANIC PHOTONIC MATERIALS AND DEVICES XII		Proceedings of SPIE-The International Society for Optical Engineering		7599						75991R	10.1117/12.842614			2010	2010	The intrinsic deterioration in device performance of polymeric single layer OLEDs that were doped with a fluorescent emitter was studied. The specific focus was on the role that thermal aging, at sub-glass transition temperatures of the polymeric layer, has on the phase separation of the active layer. This was accomplished by the rational design of an oxadiazole-containing methylacrylate monomer that was energetically similar to the technologically important electron-transporting small molecule 2-biphenyl-4-yl-5-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazole (tBu-PBD). This monomer was copolymerized with a carbazole containing hole-transporting monomer 2-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl 2-methylacrylate (CE) and the resulting copolymer was utilized as the active layer with coumarin 6. With coumarin 6, the devices exhibited a stable mean luminance of ca. 400 cd/m(2) with thermal aging at temperatures ranging from 23 degrees C to 130 degrees C, while a comparable poly(9-vinyl-9H-carbazole)/tBu-PBD blend device exhibited a drop from an initial mean luminance of 2500 cd/m(2) to 1.6 cd/m(2). The reduction in luminance and luminance efficiency for the blend system was attributed to phase separation in the blend.

Herman, WN; Flom, SR; Foulger, SH		Electroluminescence with Colloidal Particles								ORGANIC THIN FILMS FOR PHOTONIC APPLICATIONS		ACS Symposium Series		1039				161	170					2010	2010	A simple route to producing electroluminescent colloidal particles that can be designed to produce a wide range of emission colors and that can be potentially converted into printable inks is presented. This approach utilizes a miniemulsion fabrication route and exploits the concept that the particles in a colloidally-based OLED can be viewed as individual "particle-devices". EL dye components were sequestered in particles that prevented any interparticle energy transfer. Red, green, and blue emitting particles were synthesized and converted into devices that exhibited emissions that spanned a large color spectrum.					236th National Meeting of the American-Chemical-Society236th National Meeting of the American-Chemical-Society	AUG 17-21, 2008AUG 17-21, 2008	Amer Chem SocAmer Chem Soc	Philadelphia, PAPhiladelphia, PA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0097-6156		978-0-8412-2563-3	WOS:000296820200011		
J	Plummer, Lawrence A.								Spatial Dependence in Entrepreneurship Research Challenges and Methods								ORGANIZATIONAL RESEARCH METHODS				13	1			146	175		10.1177/1094428109334199			JAN 2010	2010	Measures used in entrepreneurship research are often subject to spatial dependence. Spatial dependence renders ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation inappropriate because the estimates will be biased, inconsistent, and/or inefficient. The aims of this article are (a) to demonstrate how spatial dependence is especially problematic for entrepreneurship research and (b) to arm researchers with spatial modeling techniques that are more appropriate for such analysis. As such, not only will this article illustrate how to incorporate spatial dependence explicitly into the linear regression model, it also discusses how these techniques make it possible to explore and locate areas with particularly high levels of spatial dependence (i.e., hot spots). These techniques, although new to the management literature, are well known in both the regional science and geography literatures and are rapidly diffusing to economics, sociology, and related social sciences.									9	0	0	0	0	9			1094-4281			WOS:000272273100009

During the past several decades, XAFS has gained dramatic advances in every aspect, including theoretical explanation and experimental applications. In this review, we outline the basic physics underlying the X-ray absorption process, experimental design, data analysis for both extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), which is one of the mainstream directions of absorption spectroscopy and allows high-accuracy determination of the parameters of the short-range order in multicomponent amorphous and quasi-crystalline substances, and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES). The modern advances and future outlook are also briefly included.									7	0	0	1	0	7			0272-6351			WOS:000276880900001

Field Evaluation of Virginia-Type Peanut Cultivars for Resistance to Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus, Late Leaf Spot, and Stem Rot								Peanut Science				37	1			63	69		10.3146/PS09-007.1			JAN 2010	2010	Susceptibility to viral and fungal diseases is a major factor limiting profit in the production of virginia-type peanuts (Arachis hypogaea L.) in the South Carolina coastal plain. Field tests were conducted over a three-year period (2006-08) to evaluate the disease resistance of 47 experimental virginia-type breeding lines and eight cultivars. Relative to commercially available standards, cultivar Bailey (recently released by N. C. State Univ.), three sister lines (N03088T, N03089T, and N03090T), and N03091T were found to have consistently less susceptibility to tomato spotted wilt tospovirus; late leaf spot, Cercosporidium personatum (Berk. and Curt.) Deighton; and stem rot, Sclerotium rolfsii Sacc. The level of field resistance measured for these three diseases was comparable to that of a resistant runner-type cultivar, Georgia-03L. Yield was highly correlated with multiple disease resistance, and yield performance of some resistant lines exceeded the best commercial standard cultivars under reduced fungicide programs. Potential negative attributes of Bailey, its sister lines, and N03091T were a greater susceptibility to leafhopper injury, Empoasca fabae (Harris), and a relatively larger plant size at maturity, without well defined rows to facilitate digging. Other lines that demonstrated reduced susceptibility to both tomato spotted wilt and stem rot were N03005J and N02009. Although only evaluated in the last test year, five Univ. of Florida lines (FLMR7, FLMR9, FLMR12, FLMR14, and FLMR15) and Georgia-08V (recently released by the Univ. of Georgia) also showed some reduction in stem rot susceptibility relative to the standard (cultivar NC-V 11). Equally important, many experimental lines were identified with significantly greater disease susceptibility than current commercial cultivars. Under South Carolina production conditions, these lines would be poor candidates for advancement. Deployment of the multiple disease resistance found in these experimental cultivars offers several potential benefits beyond direct yield improvement: reduction of fungicide input costs for both foliar and soil disease control, prolonging the utility of currently available fungicides, and reduction of weather related harvest risk by allowing earlier initial planting dates.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0095-3679			BCI:BCI201000423042

A series of samples was produced with fullerene concentrations ranging from fractional levels to several molar percent, and the effects of the fullerence additions upon the resulting. microstructure have been considered. Thermal and electrical, transport properties have been measured from 10 to 300 K, and the data are discussed in light of the underlying physical mechanisms.									13	0	0	0	0	13			1862-6300			WOS:000274280900024

Thickness of the brush layer in dry state was similar to 15 nm. The brush, consisting of poly(ethylene glycol) and poly(acrylic acid)-b-poly(styrene) in a 50/50 composition was switched between two different states by changing the pH of the solution. An IR mapping ellipsometer at the IRIS beamline located at the BESSY II synchrotron facility in Berlin, Germany, was used for high lateral resolution in-situ measurements. The results show strong chemical changes in the brush layer due to COOH - COO- conversion of the PAA's carboxylic groups. Measurements with spot sizes of similar to 1 mm on different positions on the samples proved good homogeneity of the brush layer and the qualification of this method for investigation of ultrathin organic films in aqueous solutions in-situ with IR ellipsometry.

In this paper, we examine the solvation of TEA(+) and BF(4)(-) in ACN, and the structure, capacitance, and dynamics of the electrical double layers (EDLs) in the TEABF(4)-ACN electrolyte using molecular dynamics simulations complemented with quantum density functional theory calculations. The solvation of TEA(+) and BF(4)(-) ions is found to be much weaker than that of small inorganic ions in aqueous solutions, and the ACN molecules in the solvation shell of both types of ions show only weak packing and orientational ordering. These solvation characteristics are caused by the large size, charge delocalization, and irregular shape (in the case of TEA(+) cation) of the ions. Near neutral electrodes, the double-layer structure in the organic electrolyte exhibits a rich organization: the solvent shows strong layering and orientational ordering, ions are significantly contact-adsorbed on the electrode, and alternating layers of cations/anions penetrate ca. 1.1 nm into the bulk electrolyte. The significant contact adsorption of ions and the alternating layering of cation/anion are new features found for EDLs in organic electrolytes. These features essentially originate from the fact that van der Waals interactions between organic ions and the electrode are strong and the partial desolvation of these ions occurs easily, as a result of the large size of the organic ions. Near charged electrodes, distinct counter-ion concentration peaks form, and the ion distribution cannot be described by the Helmholtz model or the Helmholtz + Poisson-Boltzmann model. This is because the number of counter-ions adsorbed on the electrode exceeds the number of electrons on the electrode, and the electrode is over-screened in parts of the EDL. The computed capacitances of the EDLs are in good agreement with that inferred from experimental measurements. Both the rotations (ACN only) and translations of interfacial ACN and ions are found to slow down as the electrode is electrified. We also observe an asymmetrical dependence of these motions on the sign of the electrode charge. The rotation/diffusion of ACN and the diffusion of ions in the region beyond the first ACN or ion layer differ only weakly from those in the bulk.									37	2	0	0	0	37			1463-9076			WOS:000277689500031	20467670

We find experimentally that such energy transfer is the most efficient at a solvent pH of 8 and for a phenanthrene : dendrimer molar ratio of 1 : 2. Using molecular dynamics simulations we show that the strongest binding interactions occur between phenanthrene and the primary amines of the dendrimer. The simulations provide evidence that at low pH, phenanthrene-phenanthrene interactions are favorable and compete with phenanthrene-dendrimer binding. This study offers a new scheme for detecting dendrimer molecular assembly and a physical basis for exploiting dendrimer nanotechnologies for water purification and environmental remediation.									27	0	0	4	0	27			1463-9076			WOS:000280708400020	20571614

Latitudinal Differences in the Hibernation Characteristics of Woodchucks (Marmota monax)								PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL ZOOLOGY				83	1			135	141		10.1086/648736			JAN-FEB 2010	2010	There is little information on the phenotypic flexibility of hibernation characteristics within species. To address this issue, we observed differences in hibernation characteristics of three free-ranging populations of woodchucks (Marmota monax) distributed along a latitudinal gradient from Maine to South Carolina. Data from free-ranging animals exhibited a direct relationship between latitude and length of the hibernation season. As expected, woodchucks in the northern latitudes hibernated longer than those in the southern latitudes. Also, the length of interbout arousals decreased with increase in latitude, whereas the length of torpor bouts and the number of arousals increased. Thus, we observed phenotypic plasticity in hibernation characteristics based primarily on latitudinal temperature differences in each population. Further analysis revealed a direct relationship between latitude and total time spent in torpor. Maine animals spent 68% more time in torpor than South Carolina animals. However, total time spent euthermic did not differ among the three populations. The "cost-benefit" hypothesis of hibernation may help to explain these results. It assumes that hibernators avoid the physiological stress of torpor by staying euthermic as much as possible. Woodchucks in each population maximized time spent euthermic, utilizing torpor only at the level needed to survive winter hibernation and to commence reproduction in the spring.									23	0	0	22	0	23			1522-2152			WOS:000272845800013	19958172

During this period, a new generation of plant pathologists emerged in the United States Department of Agriculture, agricultural colleges, and state agricultural experiment stations with a methodological and theoretical framework to determine the cause and nature of disease and make control recommendations based on experimental evidence. These plant pathologists, in turn, became eager to establish a professional identity, for some an identity separate from traditional botany and mycology. For these scientists, the goal would be facilitated by establishing a new society for plant pathologists. The story of the creation of APS is best understood within the nature of the ensuing debates over identity and the merits of forming a new society among its first generation of scientists.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0031-949X			WOS:000272496500001	19968545

The twining response prior to haustoria formation is regarded as the first sign for dodders to parasitize host plants, and thus has been the focus of studies on the host-parasite interaction. However, the molecular mechanism is still poorly understood. In the present work, we have investigated the different effects of blue and white light on the twining response, and identified a set of proteins that were differentially expressed in dodder seedlings using a proteomic approach. Approximately 1,800 protein spots were detected on each 2-D gel, and 47 spots with increased or decreased protein levels were selected and analyzed with MALDI-TOF-MS. Peptide mass fingerprints (PMFs) obtained for these spots were used for protein identification through cross-species database searches. The results suggest that the blue light-induced twining response in dodder seedlings may be mediated by proteins involved in light signal transduction, cell wall degradation, cell structure, and metabolism.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0167-4412			WOS:000272320400015	19876747

We investigated the genetic basis of sex-specific differences in wing size between two closely related species of Nasonia by positional cloning a major male-specific locus, wing-size1 (ws1). Male wing size increases by 45% through cell size and cell number changes when the ws1 allele from N. giraulti is backcrossed into a N. vitripennis genetic background. A positional cloning approach was used to fine-scale map the ws1 locus to a 13.5 kilobase region. This region falls between prospero (a transcription factor involved in neurogenesis) and the master sex-determining gene doublesex. It contains the 5'-UTR and cis-regulatory domain of doublesex, and no coding sequence. Wing size reduction correlates with an increase in doublesex expression level that is specific to developing male wings. Our results indicate that non-coding changes are responsible for recent divergence in sex-specific morphology between two closely related species. We have not yet resolved whether wing size evolution at the ws1 locus is caused by regulatory alterations of dsx or prospero, or by another mechanism. This study demonstrates the feasibility of efficient positional cloning of quantitative trait loci (QTL) involved in a broad array of phenotypic differences among Nasonia species.									28	0	0	26	0	28			1553-7390			WOS:000274194300029	20090834

The electrical volume resistivity of composites decreased with the addition of CNFs from over 10(12) Omega cm for pure LLDPE to less than 10(4) Omega cm for carbon nanofibers (CNF) contents of 15 wt% or more. Tensile modulus increased from 110 MPa for pure LLDPE to 200 MPa and 300 MPa for 15 wt% MJ and 15 wt% PR composites, respectively. However, the tensile strength remained fairly unchanged at about 20 MPa. Strain-to-failure decreased from 690% for pure LLDPE to 460% and 120% for 15 wt% MJ and 15 wt% PR composites, respectively. It was inferred that the interfacial interactions of LLDPE matrix with MJ fibers is better than that with PR fibers, resulting from the rougher surface of MJ fibers. POLYM. ENG. SCL, 50:93-99, 2010.

During each of 3 visits, the following ice samples were collected: 1) freshly prepared, unused ice; 2) product-contact ice from ice-packed poultry parts; 3) product-contact ice from ice-packed poultry that had been visibly inspected and condemned as not for reuse; and 4) product-contact ice from ice-packed poultry that had passed visible inspection and had been prepared for reuse by washing (rinse with potable water and drain). The overall pattern for lowest to highest numbers of total aerobic microorganisms, coliforms, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacteriaceae was as follows: unused ice < washed ice < product-contact ice < condemned ice. Mean levels of total aerobic microorganisms, coliforms, and Enterobacteriaceae in the unused ice were 0.3, 0.4, and 0.4 log(10) cfu/mL, respectively. No E. coli was detected in the unused or washed ice, and levels were 0.5 and 1.5 log(10) cfu/mL in the product-contact and condemned ice samples, respectively. Mean levels of bacteria enumerated in condemned ice were 0.8, 1.0, and 0.6 log(10) cfu/mL higher than the levels of bacteria found in product-contact ice for coliforms, E. coli, and Enterobacteriaceae, respectively. Washing and draining the product-contact ice decreased counts by 0.9, 0.7, 0.5, and 1.7 log(10) cfu/mL for total aerobic microorganisms, coliforms, E. coli, and Enterobacteriaceae, respectively. All of the ice samples had similar pH values (pH 6.1 to 6.4). Unused and washed ice were not significantly different for total solids, total suspended solids, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, and chemical oxygen demand. Condemned ice contained the highest concentration of total solids, total suspended solids, total Kjeldahl nitrogen, and chemical oxygen demand, with levels more than 3 times that found in product contact ice. Data from the present study demonstrate that visible contamination in ice corresponds with increased microbiological and chemical contamination. Product-contact ice may be washed and the washing procedure can reduce the bacterial, solids, nitrogen, and organic loads.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0032-5791			WOS:000273144000020	20008812

Field-wide application results in nematicides being applied to areas without nematodes and the application of sub-effective levels in areas with high nematode densities. Efforts to use grid maps as a guide to site-specific application have proven to be too expensive to be cost effective. Recently, the availability of GPS-GIS has allowed the use of soil electrical conductivity systems to rapidly and inexpensively develop cost effective soil texture maps. These maps are used to project where nematodes are likely to occur within a field. Variable-rate application systems for granular and fumigant nematicides have been developed and tied via software to soil texture maps providing a mechanism for the effective delivery of nematicides in a site-specific, variable-rate manner in individual fields. Efforts in South Carolina, Georgia, and Arkansas are further developing this system and refining our knowledge of how soil texture and other edaphic factors affect the distribution of cotton nematodes.									6	0	0	6	0	6					978-90-481-9276-2	WOS:000281513700024

The exploratory, theory-based, qualitative study design involved interviews with preschoolers (n=24) and their primary care providers (n=22) and childcare providers (n=2). Maps were used to qualitatively compare similarities in responses to questions regarding fruits and vegetables between a preschooler and her primary care provider and childcare provider. The concepts expressed by the preschoolers were shared minimally with their primary care providers and childcare providers. Further work is needed in understanding how to utilize primary care providers and childcare providers and the underlying preschool contextual setting to increase preschoolers' concepts and knowledge of fruits and vegetables.									0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-60876-026-8	WOS:000284337000011

This emerging technology shows great promise in regenerative medicine, because it may help to address current crisis of tissue and organ shortage for transplantation. Organ printing is developing fast, and there are exciting new possibilities in this area. Successful cell and organ printing requires many key elements. Among these, the choice of appropriate cells for printing is vital. This chapter surveys available cell sources for cell and organ printing application and discusses factors that affect cell choice. Special emphasis is put on several important factors, including the proposed printing system and bioprinters, the assembling method, and the target tissues or organs, which need to be considered to select proper cell sources and cell types. In this chapter, characterizations of the selected cells to justify and/or refine the cell selection will also be discussed. Finally, future prospects in this field will be envisioned.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1618-7210		978-1-4419-1394-4	WOS:000274149200004

Successful implementation is a direct result of close collaboration between medical and engineering personnel. The use of medical imaging and rapid prototyping has the potential to reduce the cost and time in the fabrication of the wax patterns and could result in a more accurate morphologic result. This chapter describes the use of medical imaging and rapid prototyping used in the fabrication of an auricular wax pattern and its adaption to the clinical defect. The use of this technology results in a more symmetrical wax pattern and a significant time saving compared to sculpting in the traditional manner.Maxillofacial Prosthetics is the subspecialty of prosthodontics in dentistry dealing with the prosthetic rehabilitation of head and neck cancer, trauma, and craniofacial patients. The specialty involves extraoral prostheses (Figs. 7.1-7.3) such as nasal, orbital, and auricular defects and intraoral prostheses such as obturators (Fig. 7.4), resection appliances, speech bulbs, and palatal lifts. For many years, the custom made prosthesis fabricated by hand was time intensive. The use of technology has the potential to transform the specialty in which Surgical and prosthetic reconstruction are planned virtually, three-dimensional models are made for treatment planning, and the fabrication of custom made prostheses [1]. The use of medical imaging and rapid prototyping has been used more extensively with extraoral prostheses: whereas, the use of this technology in intraoral prostheses is at its infancy.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1618-7210		978-1-4419-1394-4	WOS:000274149200007

The preoperative system requires the preparation of a high volume of patients, each with an individual set of characteristics and array of required tasks before surgery. Staff resources do not have a prescribed sequence of activities nor mutually exclusive duties. A novel discrete event modeling paradigm has been adopted for simulating the complex behavior of the preoperative system, identifying the underlying causes of process inefficiencies, and testing mitigating strategies. Current investigations are underway to shift the prescriptive approach of resource decision-making towards an agent-based approach, allowing resources to select their workload in such a way that achieves maximum utility for the agent.					2010 Winter Simulation Conference2010 Winter Simulation Conference	DEC 05-08, 2010DEC 05-08, 2010	IEEE; ASA; ACM/SIGSIM; IEEE/SMC; IIE; INFORMS-SIM; NIST; SCSIEEE; ASA; ACM/SIGSIM; IEEE/SMC; IIE; INFORMS-SIM; NIST; SCS	Baltimore, MDBaltimore, MD	1	0	0	0	0	1			0891-7736		978-1-4244-9864-2	WOS:000287976702040

We show that with the knowledge of distance to the next charging station only, substantial reduction in fuel use, up to 18%, is possible by planning a blended utilization of electric motor and the engine throughout the entire trip. To achieve this we formulate a modified Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS) which takes into account the traveling distance. We show further fuel economy gain, in the order of 1-5%, is possible if the future terrain and velocity are known; we quantify this additional increase in fuel economy for a number of velocity cycles and a hilly terrain profile via deterministic dynamic programming.					2nd Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Conference (DSCC 2009)/Bath/ASME Symposium on Fluid Power and Motion Control2nd Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Conference (DSCC 2009)/Bath/ASME Symposium on Fluid Power and Motion Control	OCT 12-14, 2009OCT 12-14, 2009	ASME, Dynam Syst & Control Div; ASME, Fluid Power Syst DivASME, Dynam Syst & Control Div; ASME, Fluid Power Syst Div	Hollywood, CAHollywood, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-4892-0	WOS:000279952600034

ASME					WIND SHEAR MODELING FOR WIND TURBINE SITING STUDIES								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME DYNAMIC SYSTEMS AND CONTROL CONFERENCE 2009, PTS A AND B								339	345					2010	2010	A wind turbine generator offers a green renewable alternative to the traditional fossil and nuclear fuel processes to generate electrical power. Both wind energy technology and wind turbine farm designs remain in demand given the current growth in energy requirements and the public's preference for clean sources. Simply put, wind energy offers a safe, relatively cost effective solution for global energy production. For example, the energy demand for populated coastal cities encourages offshore farms to fulfill future electrical needs. Similarly, wind turbines may be placed in land-locked regions and power transmitted through electric grids to population centers. Most wind models available to engineers offer superb capabilities for predicting wind velocities on land and far offshore (5 km and greater). However, near shore winds have proven difficult to determine due to surface roughness, thermal stratification, and abrupt displacement height variances. This paper discusses the model comparison of two foremost wind speed prediction tools, AWS Truewinds' MASS and WindPro's WAsP. The model comparison is related to measured South Carolina coastal data and suggests AWS Truewind's MASS wind shear model is the more effective near-shore wind speed prediction tool. In arriving at these results, several areas of future work are discussed.					2nd Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Conference (DSCC 2009)/Bath/ASME Symposium on Fluid Power and Motion Control2nd Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Conference (DSCC 2009)/Bath/ASME Symposium on Fluid Power and Motion Control	OCT 12-14, 2009OCT 12-14, 2009	ASME, Dynam Syst & Control Div; ASME, Fluid Power Syst DivASME, Dynam Syst & Control Div; ASME, Fluid Power Syst Div	Hollywood, CAHollywood, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-4892-0	WOS:000279952600045

A distributed-parameters modeling is considered for such system. The motions of the microcantilever are studied in a general Cartesian coordinate with an excitation at the base such that beam end with a tip mass is subject to a general force. This general force comprising of two attractive and repulsive parts with high power terms is taken as the atomic intermolecular one which has a relation with the displacement between the tip mass and the surface such that the total general force will be in the form of an implicit nonlinear equation. It is most desired to observe the effects of the base excitation in high frequencies on the rip van der Waals interaction force. Hence, the general force will produce a peak in the FFT spectrum corresponding to the frequency of the base.					2nd Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Conference (DSCC 2009)/Bath/ASME Symposium on Fluid Power and Motion Control2nd Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Conference (DSCC 2009)/Bath/ASME Symposium on Fluid Power and Motion Control	OCT 12-14, 2009OCT 12-14, 2009	ASME, Dynam Syst & Control Div; ASME, Fluid Power Syst DivASME, Dynam Syst & Control Div; ASME, Fluid Power Syst Div	Hollywood, CAHollywood, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-4892-0	WOS:000279952600101

It employs a piezoresistive sensing device with a high level of accuracy to avoid using the bulky and expensive laser interferometer. Change in the resistance of piezoelectric layer due to the deflection of microcantilever, caused by the variation of surface topography, is monitored through a Wheatstone bridge. Hence, it captures the surface topography without the use of laser and with nanometer scale accuracy. To improve the speed of imaging, however, a Lyapunov-based robust adaptive control strategy is implemented in the 2-DOF scanning stage. It has been demonstrated in an earlier publication that this control framework has superior performance over the conventional PID controllers typically used in commercial AFMs. The paper, then, demonstrates a set of experiments on a standard AFM calibration sample with 200 nm stepped topography. Results indicate accurate imaging of the sample up to the frequency of 30 Hz, for a 16 mu m x 16 mu m scanning area, proving the feasibility of less costly and high speed AFM-based metrology.					2nd Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Conference (DSCC 2009)/Bath/ASME Symposium on Fluid Power and Motion Control2nd Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Conference (DSCC 2009)/Bath/ASME Symposium on Fluid Power and Motion Control	OCT 12-14, 2009OCT 12-14, 2009	ASME, Dynam Syst & Control Div; ASME, Fluid Power Syst DivASME, Dynam Syst & Control Div; ASME, Fluid Power Syst Div	Hollywood, CAHollywood, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-4892-0	WOS:000279952600102

A better understanding of the nonlinear response and subharmonics of such systems is needed to enhance the applications of piezoelectrically actuated microcantilevers that are increasingly becoming popular in many science and engineering areas including scanning force microscopy, biosensors, and microactuators. In this paper, the method of multiple scales is used to derive the 2x and 3x subharmonic resonances appearing in nonlinear flexural vibrations of a piezoelectrically actuated microcantilever.

Moving radiant actuators, in particular act on a distributed parameter process where the velocity of the actuator is an additional manipulated variable with its own constraints. In this paper, a model predictive control (MPG) scheme is developed for a distributed-parameter process employing such a moving radiant actuator. The designed MPG controller uses an online optimization approach to determine both the radiant intensity and velocity of the moving actuator based on a linearized process model and a distributed state/parameter estimator A particular source-model reduction that enables the approach is outlined. The proposed strategy is then demonstrated for a radiative curing process considering different control scenarios with the objective of achieving desired cure level uniformhy and minimizing process energy use.

In this paper, shear damage behaviors of five different hexagonal mesostructures are investigated with rapid prototyped polycarbonate (PC) honeycomb coupon samples and proper design of a fixture for shear loading. Effective shear stress-strain curves of PC honeycomb coupons are generated for each shear test and the corresponding local cell wall failure is investigated. Two different failure modes of PC honeycombs were observed primarily depending on the cell wall thickness: The PC honeycombs having a lower cell wall thickness induce the plastic post buckling, resulting in preventing propagation of initial cracks through the cell wall end up with higher plastic load bearing. On the other hand, the failure mode of the honeycombs having a high cell wall thickness is the cell wall fracture by crack propagation through wall without severe buckling.

This study makes use of the change notifications to identify if any of the change were as a result of a previous change.

This research explores how complexity is managed within the design process through: the generation of complexity within the design process (sources), the techniques which were used to manage complexity (approaches), and the examination of design tools with respect to complexity. Mappings are developed between the sources, the approaches, and the tools with respect to phases of design. The mappings are propagated through these distinct, yet adjacent domains in order to study how the tools might be able to be used to manage complexity sources found in different stages of the design process. As expected, the highest value for each design tool is found in the stage of design in which the tool is traditionally been used. However, there are secondary ratings which suggest that design tools can be used in other stages of the design process to manage specific aspects of complexity.

However, there is generally no guarantee that they will converge to the expected optimum design under general assumptions. Those with proven convergence often have restricted hypotheses or a prohibitive cost related to the required computational effort. Therefore there is still a need for improved, mathematically grounded, decomposition and coordination techniques that will achieve convergence while remaining robust, flexible and easy to implement. In recent years, classical Lagrangian and augmented Lagrangian methods have received renewed interest when applied to decomposed design problems. Some methods are implemented using a subgradient optimization algorithm whose performance is highly dependent on the type of dual update of the iterative process. This paper reports on the implementation of a cutting plane approach in conjunction with Lagrangian coordination and the comparison of its performance with other subgradient update methods. The method is demonstrated on design problems that are decomposable according to the analytic target cascading (ATC) scheme.

The objective of this method is to design a skin structure that will deform to a desired final shape when acted on by a specific load. The method utilizes a ground structure geometry which can facilitate variable bending stiffness along the length of the skin using compliant spring members. Synthesis procedures involve the use of direct displacement to determine how the bending stiffness of the skin must vary to produce the desired shape change. The direct displacement synthesis method differs from other compliant mechanism synthesis methods found in literature, such as pseudo-rigid-body and continuum structure optimization, in the approach taken to solve for the unknown variables in the system. By using direct displacement to determine how the structure must respond to a specific load to achieve the desired shape change, the unknown variables within the system can be extracted directly without the use of optimization techniques.

While designing an effective shear modulus, e.g., G(12)* of 1 OMPa, of hexagonal honeycombs, we are searching honeycomb geometries. Using an aluminum alloy (7075-T6) as the constituent material, the in-plane linear elastic honeycomb model is employed to get effective shear moduli, effective shear yield strengths and effective shear yield strains of hexagonal honeycombs. The numerical parametric study based on the linear cellular theory is combined with honeycomb design to get the optimal cell geometry associated with a manufacturing limitation. The re-entrant geometry makes 7075-T6 NPR honeycombs flexible, resulting in an effective shear yield strength, (tau(pl)*)12 of 1.7MPa and an effective shear yield strain, (gamma(pl))12 of 0.17 when they are designed to have a G(12)* of lOMPa.

Usually, the slider motion is defined first to synthesize crank motion. When slider motion has acceleration continuity only, crank acceleration is discontinuous causing shock loading at high speeds. To avoid such behavior, motion constraints must be assigned up to ping continuity at the limiting positions. This paper presents kinematic motion equations of slider-crank mechanisms with input from both the slider and crank. Toggle and limiting positions having required transmission angles at varied link ratios are determined. Motion functions that yield continuous crank acceleration are demonstrated.

Also, a comparative study is conducted on the ability of the sinusoidal mesostructure over auxetic mesostructure for high shear flexure. In an effort to design components with high shear flexure, the re-entrant wall of the auxetic honeycomb is replaced with a sinusoidal wall. Existing analytical models that predict the effective in-plane elastic properties for auxetic honeycomb mesostructure are limited to straight re-entrant wall. In order to predict the effective in plane shear modulus, G12*, for conceptual design study, an analytical model is needed. The principle of energy methods is used to determine the effective in-plane shear modulus and is verified with the solution in ABAQUS. The analytical model is in agreement with the computational model with a 10% maximum error over a wide range of cell wall thickness and shear strain. The two structures are designed to possess the same equivalent shear modulus and the degree of shear flexure is measured computationally in terms of yield shear strain. The sinusoidal structure introduces nonlinearity with increase in cell wall thickness and shear strain. This nonlinearity causes the sinusoidal auxetic mesostructure to have low shear flexure at a high shear modulus which is higher than about 1 OMPa. However, it is marginally better than auxetic mesostructure at a low shear modulus which is 10MPa and less.

Using Green-Naghdi's theory, the updated Lagrangian governing integral equation is obtained from the weak form of elastoplasticity over a local sub-domain. The meshless function approximation is implemented by using the moving least-squares approximation. In Green-Naghdi's theory, the Green-Lagrange strain is decomposed into the elastic part and plastic part and a J(2) elastoplastic constitutive relation is used to relate the Green-Lagrange strain to the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress. The essential boundary conditions are imposed by a generalized collocation method and the natural boundary conditions are incorporated into the system governing equation and require no special handling. The solution algorithm for large deformation analysis is discussed in detail. Numerical examples show that this method is accurate and robust.

In this formulation, the problem domain is clouded with a node set using automatic node generation. The sub-domain and the support domain related to each node are also generated automatically using algorithms developed for this purpose. The governing integral equation is obtained from the weak form of elastoplasticity over a local sub-domain and the moving least-squares approximation is employed for meshless function approximation. The geotechnical materials are described by pressure-sensitive multi-surface Drucker-Prager/Cap plasticity constitutive law with hardening. A generalized collocation method is used to impose the essential boundary conditions and natural boundary conditions are incorporated in the system governing equations. A comparison of the meshless results with the FEM results shows that the meshless integral method is accurate and robust enough to solve geotechnical materials.

The current matrix based modeling schemes are congruent to the steps followed in typical design processes but are limited to functional requirements. An industrial case study is analyzed to understand how and where the non functional requirements contribute to the design. It is observed from the case study that the non functional requirements drive the design decision process and constrains the way the product functionality is realized. Based on the observations made in the case study, a sequence of multiple domains is proposed: functional requirements to functions, functions to working principle, working principle to non functional requirements, non functional requirements to components, components to design parameters, design parameters to test measures and test measures to tests. This sequence is realized in a matrix based hierarchical modeling scheme, to capture the conceptual design information.

This data management system has been in use and evolving over a span of fifteen years. To ensure the system is robust to withstand the future growth of the corporation, a study is done to identify deficiencies that may prohibit efficient large scale data management. Specifically, this case study focused on the means in which project requirements are managed and explored the issues of perceived utility in the system. Two major findings are presented: completion metrics are not consistent or expressive of the actual needs and there is no linking between the activities and the original client requirements. Thus, the results of the study were used to depict the potential vulnerability of such deficiencies.

Requirements engineering involves several key activities including eliciting, modeling, and analyzing requirements. Problems with requirements engineering include addressing requirements generated from multiple design perspectives, communicating requirements across the design team, and understanding how requirements affect other product design information. Several requirement management tools have been developed to address these issues. However, evaluating the capabilities of current and next generation tools has not been systematically addressed. In this paper, a systematic approach and example problem are developed to evaluate the capability of modem requirements management tools. First, eight capabilities are identified from existing literature and industry design problems. Next, a baseline example problem is developed and implemented in two requirement management tools, namely IBM DOORS and No Magic MagicDraw+SysML. The evaluation results show that each software tool addresses seven of the eight capabilities to a varying degree, with the exception of input validation of an individual requirement. Further, SysML offers a robust and descriptive set of relationships for modeling complex engineering systems that are useful for requirements analysis. Finally, the research is not intended to be a complete survey of all requirements management tools, but rather to provide a repeatable and systematic method for evaluating and developing requirements management tools.

The non-pneumatic tire consists of three major components: two inextensible circumferential membranes, a critical shear beam, and deformable spokes. The non-pneumatic tire fabricated of segmented cylinders is illustrated and the FEM model of pneumatic tire is presented in detail. The tire is treated as an elastic deformable body and the inertial effect is included. The road and obstacle is represented as analytical rigid bodies.

Similar to music-playing harmonica that create tones via oscillations of reeds when subjected to air blow, the proposed device uses flow-induced self-excited oscillations of a piezoelectric beam embedded within a cavity to generate electric power. Specifically, when the volumetric flow rate of air past the beam exceeds a certain threshold, the energy pumped into the structure via nonlinear pressure forces offsets the intrinsic damping in the system setting the beam into self-sustained limit-cycle oscillations. The vibratory energy is then converted into electricity through principles of piezoelectricity.

A series of function structures are developed in an attempt to create an accurate model of a passively morphing airfoil. This paper describes each approach taken, while noting their modeling aspects that were successful or unsuccessful to identify representation features of existing function structure syntax and rules that relate to the usability of the models. System boundaries and definitions, function and flow definitions, carrier flows, and system state definitions are investigated. It was found that function structures in their current state, are incapable of accurately modeling the functionality of the shape changing aspect of a passively morphing airfoil. These limitations are identified and recommendations necessary to model artifacts similar to the morphing airfoil are presented. Finally, previous research efforts in the design of morphing airfoil technology are presented as solutions to certain key functions identified, thereby demonstrating the possible benefits of implementing function structures to this field.

Current research efforts have focused on the formalization of functional models, development of function-based design repositories, and concept generation based on a quantitative functional similarity metric. In this paper, three levels of abstraction of function models are obtained by including supporting functions, excluding supporting functions, and applying abstraction rules to function models of 128 products in a design repository. The similarity of these products is computed using the Functional Basis controlled vocabulary and a matrix-based similarity metric. A matrix-based clustering algorithm is then applied to the similarity results to identify groups of similar products. A subset of these products is then studied to further compare the three levels of abstraction and to validate the results. Similarity between consumer products depends on the level of abstraction of the models, with higher levels of abstraction producing better results.

Using a simple nonlinear electromechanical model and the method of multiple scales, we study the general nonlinear physics of energy harvesting from a piezoelectric beam subjected to static axial loading and traversal dynamic excitation. We obtain analytical expressions for the steady-state response amplitude, the voltage drop across a resistive load, and the output power. We utilize these expression to study the effect of the axial loading on the overall nonlinear behavior of the harvester. It is demonstrated that, in addition to the ability of tuning the harvester to the excitation frequency via axial load variations, the axial load aids in i) increasing the electric damping in the system thereby enhancing the energy transfer from the beam to the electric load, ii) amplifying the effect of the external excitation on the structure, and hence, increases the steady-state response amplitude and output voltage, and iii) increasing the bandwidth of the harvester by enhancing the effective nonlinearity of the system.

ASME					REDUCED-ORDER MODELING OF ENERGY HARVESTERS								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, VOL 1, PTS A AND B								477	488					2010	2010	This work addresses the accuracy and convergence of reduced-order models (ROMs) of energy harvesters. Two types of energy harvesters are considered, a magnetostrictive rod in axial vibrations and a piezoelectric cantilever beam in traverse oscillations. The partial differential equations (PDEs) and associated boundary conditions governing the motion of these harvesters are obtained. The eigenvalue problem is then solved for the exact eigenvalues and modeshapes. Furthermore, an exact expression for the steady-sate output power is attained by direct solution of the PDEs. Subsequently, the results are compared to a ROM attained following the Rayleigh-Ritz procedure. It is observed that the eigenvalues and output power near the first resonance frequency are more accurate and has a much faster convergence to the exact solution for the piezoelectric cantilever beam. In addition, it is shown that the convergence is governed by two dimensionless constants, one that is related to the electromechanical coupling and the other to the ratio between the time constant of the mechanical oscillator and the harvesting circuit. Using these results, conclusions are drawn with regards to the design values for which the common single-mode ROM is accurate.

As the design progresses, additional information is externally added or internally generated within the design process. As a result, the design solution becomes increasingly well-defined and the uncertainty of the problem reduces, diminishing to zero at the end of the process when the design is fully defined. In this research a measure of uncertainty is proposed for a class of engineering design problems called discrete design problems. Previously, three components of complexity in engineering design, namely, size, coupling and solvability, were identified. In this research uncertainty is measured in terms of the number of design variables (size) and the dependency between the variables (coupling). The solvability of each variable is assumed to be uniform for the sake of simplicity. The dependency between two variables is measured as the effect of a decision made on one variable on the solution options available to the other variable. A measure of uncertainty is developed based on this premise, and applied to an example problem to monitor uncertainty reduction through the design process. Results are used to identify and compare three task-sequencing strategies in engineering design.

Cell wall thicknesses are found for each material to reach the target shear modulus for available cell heights with five honeycomb configurations. PC honeycomb structures can be tailored with 0.4 to 1.3mm cell wall thicknesses to attain the 6.5MPa shear modulus. MS honeycombs can be built with 0.2mm or lower wall thicknesses to reach the target shear modulus. Sensitivity of wall thickness on effective properties may be a hurdle to overcome when designing metallic honeycombs. The sensitivity appears to be more significant with an increased number of unit cells in the vertical direction. PC auxetic honeycombs having 0.4 to 1.9 mm cell wall thicknesses show 15% maximum effective shear strain without local cell damage. Auxetic honeycombs having negative Poisson's ratio show lower effective shear moduli and higher maximum effective shear strains than the regular counterparts, implying that auxetic honeycombs are candidate geometries for a shear flexure design.

As the design models become increasingly realistic, the decision making methodology becomes increasingly complex. That is, because of the realistic design models, more and more decisions are made under uncertain environments without making any unrealistic assumptions. A decision maker is usually forced to work with uncertainties of which some stochastic information is known (aleatory) or no information is known (epistemic). In this paper, we discuss both forms of uncertainties and their modeling methodologies. We also define risk as a random function of these uncertainties and propose a risk quantification technique. Existing methods to handle aleatory uncertainties are discussed and an alternative search based decision making methodology is proposed to handle epistemic uncertainties. We illustrate our decision making methodology using the side-impact crashworthiness problem presented by Gu, et.al. [1]. In addition to the aleatory uncertainties considered by these researchers, we model a couple of non-design variables as epistemic uncertainties in our decision problem. Lack of information of these epistemic uncertainties increases the complexity of the side-impact crashworthiness problem significantly. However the proposed methodology helps to identify a robust design with respect to epistemic uncertainty					ASME International Design Engineering Technical Conferences/Computers and Information in Engineering ConferenceASME International Design Engineering Technical Conferences/Computers and Information in Engineering Conference	AUG 30-SEP 02, 2009AUG 30-SEP 02, 2009	ASME, Design Engn Div; ASME, Computers & Info Engn DivASME, Design Engn Div; ASME, Computers & Info Engn Div	San Diego, CASan Diego, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-4902-6	WOS:000290417800098

Both exploit two characteristics of VCFEM. The first approach utilizes the property that a hole or inclusion can be placed in the element: the design variables for the topology optimization are sizes of the hole. In the second approach, we note that VCFEM may mesh the design domain as n sided polygons. We restrict our attention to hexagonal meshes of the domain while applying Solid Isotropic Material Penalization (SIMP) material model. Researchers have shown that hexagonal meshes are not subject to the checker boarding problem commonly associated with standard linear quad and triangle elements. We present several examples to illustrate the efficacy of the methods in compliance minimization as well as discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method.

ASME					A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF QUANTITATIVE SCALES TO POPULATE AFFORDANCE STRUCTURE MATRICES								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, VOL 8, PTS A AND B								863	872					2010	2010	The Affordance Structure Matrix (ASM) is a concept exploration and attention directing tool to enable designers to take advantage of the special properties of affordances, such as form dependence and polarity of positive and negative affordances. However, in an ASM, as in other popular matrix based tools, the entities being mapped (in the case of an ASM, affordances and components, respectively) are typically assumed to be of equal importance. In this paper we present a comparative study of various quantitative scales used to populate ASMs. By using these scales, we can capture the relative importance of different affordances, for example that cutting the user is more important to avoid than annoying the user with noise. Also, by using scales of increased granularity for populating the interior of an ASM, the relative strength of relationships between product components and individual components can be captured. For example, larger, heavier components have a stronger relationship with transportability than smaller, lighter components. The results of the comparison studies on the case study of a shaving razor show that a scale of negative ten through positive ten for populating the interior of the matrix is necessary to produce results which clearly rank all of the components in terms of helpful and harmful relationships. The results also show that the scale used for populating the interior of the matrix has a much stronger effect on the results than does the scale used for weighting the individual affordances. An electro-mechanical razor is used as the consumer product in the comparative study. Based on the results of the study, practical suggestions for redesigning the razor are also suggested.

The same demands exist and are even more acute for military vehicles. The reduction of weight across a military vehicle platform can affect hundreds of thousands of vehicles with dramatic ramifications for military budgets, logistic support, deployment time and cost, and other factors critical to national defense. In this paper we report on methods developed for requirements analysis and function integration based on a modeling framework (developed in previous work) which captures requirements, functions, working principles, components, component parameters, test measures, and tests. We also show that the problem of assigning the mass of individual components to requirements is not solvable in practice. The methods are demonstrated using a case study of the United States Department of Defense Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV).

Function models also aid in guiding design activities such as generating concepts and allocating design team resources. Recent research effort have focused on the formalization of function models through a controlled vocabulary and archival of functional representations in computer-based repositories. However, the usefulness and interpretability of these function models has not fully been explored.This paper presents the results of a user study to ascertain the interpretability of functional representations at three levels of abstraction. In this interpretability is defined as the ability to identify the product based on a functional representation. These function models vary in abstraction in two dimensions: (1) the number of function within the model and (2) the specificity of the terms used within the functional models. Sixteen mechanical engineering graduate students are asked to identify the products from the functional models in these three abstraction levels. In addition to identifying the product, students are asked to record time and list any keywords in the functional model that help them to choose a product. Analysis of the results indicates that interpretability of a functional model increases substantially by using free language terms over a limited functional vocabulary and environmental context of the product. Additionally, the number of functions within the functional model correlates with the identification of similar products.

In this paper we present a novel interface design implemented on three multi-modal prototype systems, in which design was based on results from an initial field study we conducted. The design of these systems incorporate two main objectives: 1) enforce a systematic check on each of the items on the list to reduce missed items and 2) facilitate mobility in that the tools used to assist in inspection can be installed at one area and then later easily moved to another area. Our novel graphical software interface aims to enforce systematic checks through incorporation of a system-directed delivery of the checklist items with options for error correction and support of dynamic inspection, where items identified for inspection may differ among checkpoints. We have designed three hardware configurations that support our interface, with aims to achieve mobility from one inspection area to another, leave both hands free for inspection, and incorporate a more convenient way to refer to the list while conducting an inspection. This paper additionally presents preliminary feedback and suggestions for improvement from a pilot study conducted on our interface implemented on three hardware configurations. In the future we plan to incorporate the suggestions from the pilot study and to conduct a more formal evaluation on our multi-modal systems.					2nd ASME 2010 World Conference on Innovative Virtual Reality2nd ASME 2010 World Conference on Innovative Virtual Reality	MAY 12-14, 2010MAY 12-14, 2010	ASME, Transportat DivASME, Transportat Div	Virtual Real Appl Ctr, Ames, IAVirtual Real Appl Ctr, Ames, IA	1	0	0	0	0	1					978-0-7918-4908-8	WOS:000290053800031

Its habits and habitats have remained unknown. This scymnine coccinellid is newly reported from South Carolina on the basis of 43 adults from grasses, mainly big cordgrass (Spartina cynosuroides (L.) Roth; Poaceae), in or near brackish marshes and along tidal waterways. Its probable prey on big cordgrass is the mealybug Dysmicoccus dennoi Kosztarab. Near stands of S. cynosuroides, the coccinellid was collected occasionally from marshhay cordgrass (S. patens (Ait.) Muhl.) and from a beardgrass, Andropogon tenuispatheus (Nash) Nash (sensu Weakley 2007), that was infested by the mealybug Trionymus clandestinus McConnell and the eriococcid or felt scale Eriococcus dubius Cockerell. A diagnosis of H. venustulus and color photograph of the adult habitus are provided to facilitate recognition of this little-known lady beetle.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0013-8797			WOS:000275226000014

Nymphs and adults of C. hirtipes Blatchley were found in fallen pine cones at eight sites in Florida. Nymphs (occasionally >20/cone; n = 5) of all instars, exuviae, and teneral nymphs and adults were observed in cones, suggesting more than incidental and ephemeral occupancy by species of Cnemodus. The bugs might use the labium to transport seeds of pine and other plants to the shelter of cones before they begin to feed, obtain nutrition from pine seeds that remain in fallen cones, or feed on seeds of grasses or other plants that lodge in cones. Fallen cones could be used for overwintering and oviposition but might be most important for allowing the bugs to minimize desiccation in xeric habitats characterized by high soil-surface temperatures, especially if nymphs cluster in cones. Other heteropteran species were infrequent inhabitants of fallen pine cones: the rhyparochromids Eremocoris setosus Blatchley (Florida, Georgia, South Carolina), Neopamera bilobata (Say) (Florida), and Ozophora trinotata Barber (Florida); and the largid A rhaphe carolina Herrich-Schaeffer (South Carolina). We also record C. mavortius from crowns of bunchgrasses in southern states (Georgia, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas) and C. hirtipes from bunchgrasses in Florida.									3	0	0	2	1	3			0013-8797			WOS:000275226000015

Fully coupled thermomechanical finite element analysis of material evolution during friction-stir welding of AA5083								PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART B-JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MANUFACTURE				224	B4			609	625		10.1243/09544054JEM1750			2010	2010	Interactions between the rotating and advancing pin-shaped tool (terminated at one end with a circular cylindrical shoulder) with the clamped welding plates and the associated material and heat transport during a friction-stir welding (FSW) process are studied computationally using a fully coupled thermomechanical finite element analysis. To surmount potential numerical problems associated with extensive mesh distortions/entanglement, an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation was used, which enabled adaptive remeshing (to ensure the continuing presence of a high-quality mesh) while allowing full tracking of the material-free surfaces. To demonstrate the utility of the present computational approach, the analysis is applied to the case of FSW of AA5083 (a solid-solution strengthened and strain-hardened/stabilized Al-Mg wrought alloy). To account for the competition between plastic deformation-controlled strengthening and dynamic recrystallization-induced softening phenomena during the FSW process, the original Johnson Cook strain and strain-rate hardening and temperature-softening material strength model is modified using the available recrystallization kinetics experimental data. Lastly, the computational results obtained in the present work are compared with their experimental counterparts available in the open literature. This comparison revealed that general trends regarding spatial distribution and temporal evolutions of various material-state quantities and their dependence on the FSW process parameters are reasonably well predicted by the present computational approach.									30	2	0	0	2	31			0954-4054			WOS:000277529600007

Bi-unicondylar knee prosthesis functional assessment utilizing force-control wear testing								PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART H-JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE				224	H7			813	821		10.1243/09544119JEIM726			2010	2010	Recent in vivo studies have identified variations in knee prosthesis function depending on prosthesis geometry, kinematic conditions, and the absence/presence of soft-tissue constraints after knee replacement surgery. In particular, unicondylar knee replacements (UKR) are highly sensitive to such variations. However, rigorous descriptions of UKR function through experimental simulation studies, performed under physiological force-controlled conditions, are lacking. The current study evaluated the long-term functional performance of a widely used fixed-bearing unicompartmental knee replacement, mounted in a bi-unicondylar configuration (Bi-UKR), utilizing a force-controlled knee simulator during a simulated (ISO 14243) walking cycle. The wear behaviour, the femoral-tibial kinematics, and the incurred damage scars were analysed. The wear rates for the medial and the lateral compartments were 10.27 +/- 1.83 mg/million cycles and 4.49 +/- 0.53 mg/million cycles, respectively. Although constant-input force-controlled loading conditions were maintained throughout the simulation, femoral-tibial contact point kinematics decreased by 65 to 68 per cent for average anterior/posterior travel and by 58 to 74 per cent for average medial/lateral travel with increasing cycling time up to 2 million cycles. There were no significant differences in damage area or damage extent between the medial and the lateral compartments. Focal damage scars representing the working region of the femoral component on the articular surface extended over a range of 16-21 mm in the anterior-posterior direction. Kinematics on the shear plane showed slight variations with increasing cycling time, and the platform exhibited medial pivoting over the entire test. These measures provide valuable experimental insight into the effect of the prosthesis design on wear, kinematics, and working area. These functional assessments of Bi-UKR under force-controlled knee joint wear simulation show that accumulated changes in the UKR articular conformity manifested as altered kinematics both for anterior/posterior translations and internal/external rotations.									5	0	0	2	0	5			0954-4119			WOS:000280611500002	20839649

Two equivalent control structures for an electrohydraulic actuator								PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART I-JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND CONTROL ENGINEERING				224	I5			599	609		10.1243/09596518JSCE869			2010	2010	Two non-linear control structures are considered for position control of an electrohydraulic actuator. The first control structure is derived from a direct near input-output (IO) linearization of the actuator model with position as output. The second control structure is a cascade of a near IO linearizing pressure force controller as an inner loop to a feedback plus feedforward outer-loop position controller. In the present paper, it is shown that the two control structures are theoretically equivalent. Then, it is highlighted that the equivalence can be exploited to extract a simple and intuitive tuning procedure for selecting the gains of one control structure from the gains of the other structure. This result is particularly useful for tuning the near IO linearizing position controller as the interpretation of its gains is obscured by the non-linear state transformation of the feedback linearization. Some numerical simulation and experimental results are included to demonstrate the identified tuning procedure.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0959-6518			WOS:000281259800009

Additionally, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service (USDA FS) has, since 2006, supported the national early detection stream baiting survey of forests and urban areas to monitor the potential spread of this pathogen from nurseries and other high-risk settings. These surveys have been conducted in cooperation with universities and state forestry agencies. As a result of these activities, P. ramorum has been detected in waterways at 10 sites in six states between 2006 and June 2009 (fig. 1).Below is a brief overview of these positive sites.Florida - In 2006 and 2007, P. ramorum was recovered from standing and flowing water inside, but not outside, a retail garden center where P. ramorum-positive plants were present. In February 2008, P. ramorum was recovered from a drainage ditch at a nearby production nursery that was associated with the garden center site. Then, in December 2008 and again in March 2009, the pathogen was detected in bait leaves deployed in a stream outside this nursery.Mississippi P. ramorum was baited from a drainage ditch outside a nursery in December 2007. Subsequently, it was recovered from this ditch several times in 2008 and 2009 and a creek into which the ditch drains (using PCR on bait leaves) on multiple occasions from January 2008 through early 2009. Streamside vegetation surveys outside of the nursery resulted in PCR positives on two APHIS official host and associated host plant (HAP) (http://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/plant_pest_info/pram/) samples in December 2007 and February 2008.

These plants can be infected or merely infested by P. ramorum and with or without symptoms. The pathogen has been detected most frequently on container-grown nursery plants, and occasionally has been found in the container mix around these plants. Because of this close association with container-grown nursery plants, P. ramorum can be disseminated within a nursery, among local nurseries, and between nurseries in different states on infected plants or infested materials. Pathogen propagules can be moved readily from nurseries or landscapes to natural ecosystems in soil and water. Therefore, a major concern is that P. ramorum will be introduced into nurseries in the eastern United States (U.S.) and then will become established in forests and other natural areas where environmental conditions are favorable for pathogen survival and reproduction and susceptible plants are present. Consequently, we have been cooperating with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA APHIS) to monitor for P. ramorum in soil and water at retail nurseries in the southeastern U.S. when infected plants have been found by routine surveys.					4th Sudden Oak Death Science Symposium4th Sudden Oak Death Science Symposium	JUN 15-18, 2009JUN 15-18, 2009	US Dept Agr, Pacif SW Res Stn; California Oak Mortal Task Force; US Dept Agr, Forest Serv, Pacif SW Region; US Dept Agr, Anim & Plant Hlth Inspect Serv, Plant Protect & Quarantine; Univ California Cooperat Extens; California Dept Forestry & Fire Protect; Washington State Univ, Dept Plant Pathology; Univ California Integrated Hardwood Range Management ProgramUS Dept Agr, Pacif SW Res Stn; California Oak Mortal Task Force; US Dept Agr, Forest Serv, Pacif SW Region; US Dept Agr, Anim & Plant Hlth Inspect Serv, Plant Protect & Quarantine; Univ California Cooperat Extens; California Dept Forestry & Fire Protect; Washington State Univ, Dept Plant Pathology; Univ California Integrated Hardwood Range Management Program	Santa Cruz, CASanta Cruz, CA	6	0	0	6	0	6			0196-2094		*****************	WOS:000337495300009

Frankel, SJ; Kliejunas, JT; Palmieri, KM							Variation in Density and Diversity of Species of Phytophthora in Two Forest Stream Networks								PROCEEDINGS OF THE SUDDEN OAK DEATH FOURTH SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM		USDA FOREST SERVICE GENERAL TECHNICAL REPORT PACIFIC SOUTHWEST		229				193	+					2010	2010	Monitoring occurrence and distribution of Phytophthora species, including Phytophthora ramorum, in forest ecosystems can be achieved in several ways including sampling symptomatic plants, infested soils, and infested streams. Collecting plant and soil samples can be laborious and time consuming due to the distance surveyors need to travel. Not all forests are available for survey because of limited accessibility and stand density. Species of Phytophthora are well adapted to aquatic habitats and more diverse populations of Phytophthora spp. are found in forest streams than in nearby soils and symptomatic riparian plants. The current protocol for the National P. ramorum Early Detection Survey, conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service (USDA FS), adopted sampling forest streams using baiting and filtration procedures. One assumption being made in these monitoring efforts is that species present in a stream network are representative of those present in the land area drained by that network. Therefore, careful selection of stream networks is essential to optimize the sampling effort with limited available resources, and strategic selection of sample sites within a stream network should maximize detection of the species of Phtyophthora present A stream network in a natural ecosystem consists of a main stream, its tributaries, and a drainage point of the main stream. In this study, our hypothesis was that the occurrence and diversity of Phytophthora spp. at the drainage point of the main stream represents the overall population of Phytophthora spp. within the upstream network. If our hypothesis is true, a stream network could be surveyed effectively at the drainage point without additional sampling of the upstream tributaries.					4th Sudden Oak Death Science Symposium4th Sudden Oak Death Science Symposium	JUN 15-18, 2009JUN 15-18, 2009	US Dept Agr, Pacif SW Res Stn; California Oak Mortal Task Force; US Dept Agr, Forest Serv, Pacif SW Region; US Dept Agr, Anim & Plant Hlth Inspect Serv, Plant Protect & Quarantine; Univ California Cooperat Extens; California Dept Forestry & Fire Protect; Washington State Univ, Dept Plant Pathology; Univ California Integrated Hardwood Range Management ProgramUS Dept Agr, Pacif SW Res Stn; California Oak Mortal Task Force; US Dept Agr, Forest Serv, Pacif SW Region; US Dept Agr, Anim & Plant Hlth Inspect Serv, Plant Protect & Quarantine; Univ California Cooperat Extens; California Dept Forestry & Fire Protect; Washington State Univ, Dept Plant Pathology; Univ California Integrated Hardwood Range Management Program	Santa Cruz, CASanta Cruz, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0196-2094		*****************	WOS:000337495300034

Phytophthora spp. and other oomycetes are known to be sensitive to copper-based fungicides. Therefore, algaecides registered to manage algae in natural waterways and irrigation waters also might be effective for mitigating or even eradicating Phytophthora species, including P. ramorum, in these same waterways. Many of the commercially available algaecides are registered for use in diverse natural and agricultural water environments, and water treated with these products may be used for swimming, fishing, watering livestock, and irrigating turf and ornamental plants immediately after treatment. Consequently, these algaecides appear to be relatively safe for both humans and the environment. Experiments in our laboratory have demonstrated that two algaecides with copper-based active ingredients were toxic to zoospores, sporangia, and chlamydospores of P. ramorum and to zoospores of six other species of Phytophthora.					4th Sudden Oak Death Science Symposium4th Sudden Oak Death Science Symposium	JUN 15-18, 2009JUN 15-18, 2009	US Dept Agr, Pacif SW Res Stn; California Oak Mortal Task Force; US Dept Agr, Forest Serv, Pacif SW Region; US Dept Agr, Anim & Plant Hlth Inspect Serv, Plant Protect & Quarantine; Univ California Cooperat Extens; California Dept Forestry & Fire Protect; Washington State Univ, Dept Plant Pathology; Univ California Integrated Hardwood Range Management ProgramUS Dept Agr, Pacif SW Res Stn; California Oak Mortal Task Force; US Dept Agr, Forest Serv, Pacif SW Region; US Dept Agr, Anim & Plant Hlth Inspect Serv, Plant Protect & Quarantine; Univ California Cooperat Extens; California Dept Forestry & Fire Protect; Washington State Univ, Dept Plant Pathology; Univ California Integrated Hardwood Range Management Program	Santa Cruz, CASanta Cruz, CA	1	0	0	2	0	2			0196-2094		*****************	WOS:000337495300041

First, RTI is defined and a rationale is provided for its use in improving the reading performance of all students, particularly those students identified as at risk for reading-related learning disabilities. Next, reading risk is defined and discussed, including prevalence, antecedents, and how risk is assessed through universal screening and progress monitoring. Existing literature on the use of RTI models in reading is summarized, including small- and large-scale implementation studies. Finally, future research directions in the area of reading within an RTI model are discussed. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.									11	0	0	0	0	11			0033-3085			WOS:000273027800003

Experiments were conducted to examine the effect of sediment iron mineral composition and oxidation state on plutonium sorption and reduction. A pH 6.3 vadose zone sediment containing iron oxides and iron-containing phyllosilicates was treated with various complexants (ammonium oxalate) and reductants (hydroxylamine hydrochloride and dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate (DCB)) to selectively leach and/or reduce iron oxide and phyllosilicate/clay Fe(III). (57)Fe-Mossbauer spectroscopy was used to identify initial iron mineral composition of the sediment and monitor dissolution and reduction of iron oxides and reduction of phyllosilicate Fe(III). (57)Fe-Mossbauer spectroscopy showed that the Fe-mineral composition of the untreated sediment is: 25-30% hematite, 60-65% small-particle/Al-goethite, and < 10% Fe(III) in phyllosilicate; there was no detectable Fe(II). Upon reduction with a strong chemical reductant (dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate buffer), much of the hematite and goethite was removed. Partial reduction of phyllosilicate Fe(III) was evident in the sediments subjected to DCB treatment. Sorption of Pu(V) was monitored over one week for the untreated and each of five treated sediment fractions. Plutonium oxidation state speciation in the aqueous and solid phases was monitored using solvent extraction, coprecipitation, and XANES. The rate of sorption appears to correlate with the fraction of Fe(II) in the sediment (untreated or treated). Pu(V) was the only oxidation state measured in the aqueous phase, irrespective of treatment, whereas Pu(IV) and much smaller amounts of Pu(V) and Pu(VI) were measured in the solid phase. Surface-mediated reduction of Pu(V) to Pu(IV) occurred in treated and untreated sediment samples; Pu(V) remained on untreated sediment surface for two days before reducing to Pu(IV). Similar to the sorption kinetics, the reduction rate appears to be correlated with sediment Fe(II) concentration. The correlation between Fe(II) concentrations and Pu(V) reduction demonstrates the potential impact of changing iron mineralogy on plutonium subsurface transport through redox transition areas. These findings should influence the conceptual models of long-term stewardship of Pu contaminated sites that have fluctuating redox conditions, such as vadose zones or riparian zones.					12th International Conference on Chemistry and Migration Behaviour of Actinides and Fission Products in the Geosphere12th International Conference on Chemistry and Migration Behaviour of Actinides and Fission Products in the Geosphere	SEP 20-25, 2009SEP 20-25, 2009		Kennewick, WAKennewick, WA	17	0	0	10	0	17			0033-8230			WOS:000284126700020

It is a critical source of water for water supply, agriculture, natural ecosystems, hydroelectric power, and industry and is central to issues of drought, flood, and disease hazards. The most desired characteristic of rainfall is the rainfall rate at Earth's surface. This book, "Rainfall: State of the Science," aims to synthesize the three main aspects (microphysics, measurement and estimation, and statistical;analyses) of rainfall rate estimation efforts to provide an integral picture of this endeavor. In this introductory chapter, we present the issues that will be discussed in detail in the subsequent chapters.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0065-8448		978-0-87590-481-8	WOS:000289960800001

Raindrops experience a range of forces, including those due to fluid flow (both inside and outside the drop), hydrostatic forces, and electrostatic forces. A falling raindrop deviates in shape from spherical, becoming a flattened oblate spheroid, a shape that becomes more prominent as the raindrop diameter increases. This shape is characterized by a chord ratio, which is the ratio of the height to the width of the raindrop. The drop shape is often variable, oscillating because of excitation of the natural frequencies of the drop by the flow of fluid around the drop and through interactions between the natural frequency of the drop and vortex shedding in the wake of the drop. These interactions make raindrop morphodynamics, the study of the dynamic and stable raindrop shape, an especially rich problem. Drop collisions also affect the transient behavior of drop shape. Polarimetric radar techniques have further motivated studies of raindrop morphodynamics, since knowledge of raindrop shape can be utilized to improve rain rate retrievals using these radars. Experimentation and analytical efforts have explored several facets of raindrop morphodynamical behavior, including raindrop fall speeds, nonoscillating and oscillating shapes, chord ratio versus diameter relationships, oscillation frequencies, and the preferred harmonic modes, for example. Herein, we provide a survey of the current state of knowledge of these aspects of raindrop morphodynamics.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0065-8448		978-0-87590-481-8	WOS:000289960800002

Surface damage during ultrasonic consolidation of 3003-H18 aluminum								RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL				16	1			12	19		10.1108/13552541011011677			2010	2010	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the formation of surface damage associated with the ultrasonic consolidation (UC) of single ply 150 Am thick 3003-H18 foil to a 3003-18 build plate and the relationship between the development of this damage state with the linear weld density (LWD) achieved during consolidation.Design/methodology/approach - The influence of the consolidation control variables on the area fraction of the sonotrode induced top foil surface damage is established through application of a full factorial three-level design-of-experiment methodology, the control variables limits being fixed by the capability of the UC system.Findings - Detailed analysis of the foil top surface structure after consolidation reveals the presence of two characteristic, damaged and undamaged, regions. The former corresponded to plastically deformed areas, these being formed as a result of interaction of the foil top surface with the sonotrode, while the latter corresponded to the original foil surface. Sonotrode normal load, vibrational amplitude and its rotational velocity are found to have an interdependent affect on the development of the sonotrode-induced top surface damage. Top surface damage initiates upon impression of the sonotrode into the foil surface followed by the commencement of oscillatory and forward rotational motion of the sonotrode. Finally, evidence is presented that the degree of sonotrode induced top surface damage bears a direct relationship with the linear ultrasonic weld density developed at the foil-build plate interface, increasing top surface damage being associated with increased LWD.Originality/value - A linear relationship between the degree of bonding at the foil-build plate interface and the plastically deformed area on the foil top surface is established, this correlation demonstrating that bond formation between foils during UC depends on effective frictional conditions at the sonotrode-foil interface.									4	1	0	0	0	4			1355-2546			WOS:000274668600003

HT-29 cell was selected as a model mammalian cell to investigate the effect of laser fluence on the post-transfer cell viability. MAPLE DW-based HT-29 cell direct writing was implemented using an ArF excimer laser under a wide range of laser fluence. Trypan blue dye-exclusion was used to test the post-transfer cell viability.Findings - It has been observed that: the HT-29 cell viability decreases from 95 to 78 percent as the laser fluence increases from 258 to 1,482 mJ/cm(2); and cell injury in this study is mainly due to the process-induced mechanical stress during the cell droplet formation and landing processes while the effects of thermal influence and ultraviolet radiation are below the level of detection.Research limitations/implications - This paper reveals some interesting relationships between the laser fluence and the post-transfer mammalian cell viability and injury, and the resulting knowledge of these process-related relationships helps the wide implementation of MAPLE DW-based biofabrication. Post-transfer cell injury reversibility and cell proliferation capacity need to be further elucidated.Practical implications - This paper will help the wide implementation of cell direct-write technologies including MAPLE DW to fabricate biological constructs as artificial tissues/organs and bio-sensing devices.Originality/value - The shortage of donor organs and the need of various bio-sensing devices have significantly prompted the development of various biological material-based direct-write technologies. Process-induced cell injury happens during fabricating of biological constructs using different direct-write technologies including MAPLE DW. The post-transfer cell viability is a key index to evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of any biofabrication technique. This paper has investigated the effect of laser fluence on the post-transfer HT-29 cell viability and injury. The knowledge from this study will help effectively and efficiently fabricate various biological constructs for organ printing and biosensor fabrication applications.

Past research points to a limiting height to width ranging from 0.7 to 1.2 on build features.Design/methodology/approach - Resonances of a build feature due to a change in geometry are examined and then a simple non-linear dynamic model of the UC process is constructed that examines how the geometry change may influence the overall dynamics of the process. This simple model is used to provide estimates of how substrate geometry affects the differential motion at the bonding interface and the amount of energy emitted by friction change due to build height. The trends of changes in natural frequency, differential motion, and frictional energy are compared to experimental limits on build height.Findings - The paper shows that, at the nominal build, dimensions of the feature the excitation caused by the UC approach two resonances in the feature. In addition trends in regions of changes of differential motion, force of friction, and frictional energy follow the experimental limit on build height.Originality/value - This paper explores several aspects of the UC process not currently found in the current literature: examining the modal properties of build features, and a lumped parameter dynamic model to account for the changes in of the substrate geometry.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1355-2546			WOS:000280915700008

An improved real-time PCR system for broad-spectrum detection of Didymella bryoniae, the causal agent of gummy stem blight of cucurbits								SEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				38	3			692	703					2010	2010	Gummy stem blight is a major disease of cucurbit crops caused by Didymella bryoniae (anamorph Phoma cucurbitacearum). Previously, we used random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) profiles and specific PCR primers to sort a worldwide collection of isolates of D. bryoniae into two major genotypes, RAPD Group (RG) I and RG II. A recently developed real-time PCR assay for D. bryoniae specific only for isolates with the RG I genotype has limitations in practical disease diagnosis. The objective of the present study was to develop a new set of primers and Tay Man probe in conjunction with real-time PCR to detect both genotypes. This new Didymella detection system generated strong Ct values to a worldwide collection of D. bryoniae including 105 RG I, 13 RG II and 7 unassigned isolates. This broad spectrum and specific real-time PCR system could be used in routine seed and plant health diagnosis for D. bryoniae.									7	0	0	6	0	7			0251-0952	1819-5717		WOS:000287107500017

The sorption of both elements in boehmite suspensions (1M NaCl, 600mgL-1 boehmite) increased with increasing pH. The sorption edges for neptunium and plutonium occurred at approximately pH 8.0 and 6.6, respectively. After steady state partitioning was reached, HEDPA was added to the neptunium-boehmite and plutonium-boehmite suspensions. Neptunium and plutonium partitioning appears to be primarily affected by the formation of soluble Np:HEDPA and Pu:HEDPA complexes, the dissolution of boehmite promoted by HEDPA, and the precipitation of Np:HEDPA and Pu:HEDPA colloids. The results are discussed in terms of applicability of HEDPA-promoted dissolution as a waste reduction method in the treatment of sludge phases contained within high-level nuclear waste storage tanks.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0149-6395			WOS:000277727800001

Designing fluoroprobes through Forster resonance energy transfer: surface modification of nanoparticles through "click" chemistry								SOFT MATTER				6	24			6083	6095		10.1039/c0sm00470g			2010	2010	Aqueous-phase 83 nm poly(propargyl acrylate) (PA) nanoparticles were surface-functionalized with sparingly water soluble fluorescent moieties through a copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) (i.e., "click" transformation) to produce fluoroprobes with a large Stokes shift. For moieties which could not achieve extensive surface coverage on the particles utilizing a standard click transformation procedure, the presence of beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) during the transformation enhanced the grafting density onto the particles. Moieties containing oxadiazolyl groups exhibited an 84% increase in grafting density when the transformation was performed in the presence of the oligosaccharide, going from 1.04 oxadiazolyl groups/nm(2) to 1.91 oxadiazolyl groups/nm(2). Similarly, an azide-modified coumarin 6 (AD1) underwent a 17% enhancement in grafting density from 1.56 AD1 groups/nm(2) to 1.82 AD1 groups/nm(2) when the transformation was done in the presence of b-CD. A polyethylene glycol modified naphthalimide-based emitter (AD2) was less sensitive to the presence of b-CD due to its elevated water solubility and exhibited a 5% increase in grafting density. In contrast, a carbazolyl-containing moiety which could achieve 100% surface coverage of the particles without the use of b-CD exhibited a slight retardation in the incorporation rate (and final grafting density) onto the particle when the oligosaccharide was employed. Photoluminescence studies of the particles modified singly or with multiple moieties indicated that when oxadiazolyl and carbazolyl groups were attached to the particles, an exciplex was formed that had a peak emission at ca. 400 nm. The absorption of the surface attached naphthalimide-based dye exhibited a complete spectral overlap with the carbazole/oxadiazole exciplex emission and photoluminescence excitation studies indicated an efficient energy transfer process from the carbazolyl and oxadiazolyl groups to the dye, resulting in an emission maxima at 510 nm for the modified particles and a total Stokes shift of 180 nm. This large Stokes shift is an important determinant of the ultimate sensitivity of a fluoroprobe, where scattering and background fluorescence can interfere with the detection of low concentrations of an analyte and the ability to manipulate the separation between the excitation and emission wavelengths is a critical parameter for optimal detection.									9	0	0	0	0	9			1744-683X			WOS:000284773900009

They inform the product line's business case and they inform its architecture and quality attribute requirements. This paper establishes the connection between business goals and a product line's business case and architecture. It then presents a set of common business goal categories, gleaned from a systematic search of the business literature that can be used to elicit an organization's business goals from key stakeholders. Finally, it presents a well-defined method, which we have tried out in practice, for eliciting and capturing business goals and tying them to quality attribute requirements.					14th International Software Product Lines Conference14th International Software Product Lines Conference	SEP 13-17, 2010SEP 13-17, 2010	Korean Inst Informat Sci & Engn; CoSDEC; Hitachi Ltd; Carnegie Mellon, Software Engn Inst; BigLever Software Inc; IBM; Fraunhofer Inst Appl Informat TechnolKorean Inst Informat Sci & Engn; CoSDEC; Hitachi Ltd; Carnegie Mellon, Software Engn Inst; BigLever Software Inc; IBM; Fraunhofer Inst Appl Informat Technol	Jeju Island, SOUTH KOREAJeju Island, SOUTH KOREA	1	0	0	0	0	1			0302-9743		978-3-642-15578-9	WOS:000286579500027

We report a two orders of magnitude efficient moderately hard x-ray (50 - 300 keV) source based on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNT) irradiated by moderately intense (10(15) - 10(17) Wcm(-2)) ultra-short laser pulses. This is also accompanied by a three orders of magnitude reduction in ion debris in comparison with conventional metallic targets making these sources operationally safe. The bremsstrahlung measurement reveals a two orders of magnitude increment in x-ray flux from MWNT. Contrary to expectation that the rise in "hot" electron temperature leads to an increment of emitted ion energies form the plasma, a monotonic reduction of ion energies with increasing laser intensity for MWNT is noticed. Angle resolved ion flux measurement reveals an extremely divergent ion emission from MWNT with an evident three orders of magnitude reduction in ion flux. Based on the scaling laws for resonance absorption, our experimental data remarkably matches with theoretical predictions based on electrostatic calculations. This confirms the localized enhancement of the laser electric field near the tip of the MWNTs yield localized hot spots in the expanding plasma sheath layer leading to a non-planar expansion. This is characterized by a decrease in ion accelerating potential as well as a divergent ion emission, as observed in experiments.

Reconstructing the cosmic history of metals, from the first population of stars to the processes involved in the formation of galaxies and clusters of galaxies, is a key observational challenge. Most baryons reside in diffuse structures, in (proto)-galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and are predicted to trace the vast filamentary structures created by the ubiquitous Dark Matter. X-ray spectroscopy of diffuse matter has the unique capability of simultaneously probing a broad range of elements (C through Fe) in all their ionization stages and all binding states (atomic, molecular, and solid), and thus provides a model-independent survey of the metals. Xenia - proposed to the Astro2010 Decadal Survey - will combine cryogenic imaging spectrometers and wide field X-ray optics with fast repointing to collect essential information from three major tracers of metals: Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs), Galaxy Clusters, and the Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM). We give an overview of the mission and discuss the instruments designed to carry out these observations.

The extractable, carbonate-bound, iron/manganese oxide-bound, and organic-bound phases were extracted. A large number of trace elements were investigated, but As, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Zn had the best relative standard deviations (RSDs), usually less than 50%. Better reproducibility (less than 16%) was obtained for a standard reference material (SRM) that indicated that sample heterogeneity caused the large RSDs observed for the sediments. Analysis by ICP-OES was challenging because of the high salt concentrations in the extract. Calibration standards were matrix-matched, and some extracts were diluted to decrease the salt concentration. The percentage of extractable elements was smaller at the impacted sites compared to the upstream site; however, the concentrations of extractable elements were larger at the impacted sites. The largest exchangeable concentrations of As, Cr, and Cu were observed at the impacted sites and were 4.6, 1.1, and 5.5mg/kg, respectively. Contrarily, the largest exchangeable Co and Zn concentrations were observed upstream of the spill, which indicated that these elements were more tightly bound to fly ash compared to uncontaminated sediments. The majority of extractable As was bound to iron and manganese oxides and may be liberated under reducing conditions. Students in a senior-level environmental chemistry course performed most of this work. The entire course was devoted to this research, and students benefited from exploring one problem in great depth.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0038-7010			WOS:000283365900010

Multinuclear measurements on the square precursor complex, [Pt([9]aneS(3))Cl(2)], show acetonitrile coordination upon dechlorination in that solvent, and acetonitrile coordination is additionally confirmed by the solid-state structure of [Pt([9]aneS(3))(MeCN)(2)](2+). We form the complex through the reaction of [Pt([9]aneS(3))Cl(2)] with excess AgPF(6) in refluxing MeCN to produce a solid- state solution containing two complex cations with exclusive hexafluorophosphate counterions. Besides [Pt([9]aneS(3))(MeCN)(2)](2+), a second cation is obtained, [Pt([9]aneS(3))(2)](2+), which shows disorder between a double endo and a rare double exo conformation for the two [9]aneS(3) ligands. We also report the structures of two Rh(III) thiacrown complexes, cis-[Rh([12]aneS(4))Cl(2)](PF(6)), which involves cis chloro ligands and an asymmetric binding of the two equatorial sulphur donors, as well as trans-[Rh([16]aneS(4))(H(2)O)(Cl)](OTf)(2) with adjacent rather than alternating chair and twist-boat conformations. Lastly, the crystal structure of [{Pd([9]aneS(3))(Cl)}(2)(pyrazine)](OTf)(2) displays a pyrazine ligand bridging two [Pd([9]aneS(3))Cl](+) moieties with cis stereochemistry of the two chloro ligands. Distortion of the pyrazine ligand is observed, which alleviates strain from bridging the two Pd centres. The extended structure of the complex consists of chains of dimers running parallel to the b- axis of the crystal.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1061-0278			WOS:000274589600005

These gains require different approaches to a number of the practices in the development organization including testing. The planned variability that facilitates some of the benefits of the product line approach poses a challenge for test-related activities. This chapter provides a comprehensive view of testing at various points in the software development process and describes specific techniques for carrying out the various test-related tasks. These techniques are illustrated using a pedagogical product line developed by the Software Engineering Institute (SEI).We first introduce the main challenges approached by this chapter, then Section 2 overviews basic software product lines concepts. Section 3 explains, in a product line context, several testing concepts introduced in Chapter 1. Section 4 complements this by introducing Guided Inspections, a technique that applies the discipline of testing to the review of non-software assets typically found in software product lines. The core of the chapter is Section 5, which describes techniques that can be used to test product lines. Section 6 discusses how we can evaluate the benefits of a product line approach for testing, and Section 7 illustrates some of the presented techniques. Finally, we end with a discussion of related issues and research questions (see Section 8), and conclusions (see Section 9) about product line testing and its relation to development.					2nd Pernambuco Summer School on Software Engineering2nd Pernambuco Summer School on Software Engineering	DEC 03-07, 2007DEC 03-07, 2007	Formal Methods Europe; Sociedade Brasileira Computacao; United Nations Univ; Univ Fed Pernambuco; Univ YorkFormal Methods Europe; Sociedade Brasileira Computacao; United Nations Univ; Univ Fed Pernambuco; Univ York	Recife, BRAZILRecife, BRAZIL	5	0	0	0	0	5			0302-9743		978-3-642-14334-2	WOS:000287944900004

Quality by design (QbD) is a set of offline tools in which robust design (RD) plays significant role in controlling variance in the pharmaceutical process recently. The conventional RD approach basically deals with static data while the bioequivalence tests require dynamic (time-oriented) data. The primary objective of this paper is to develop a new RD approach with time-oriented responses to bioequivalence tests for generic drug. Because the responses are a function of control factors and time, it is reasonable that the tentative relationship can be analyzed according to both vertical and horizontal directions in which the response surface methodology (RSM) is utilized. For seeking the optimal control factors setting, a mean squared error (MSE) robust design model is chosen and optimized by utilizing Matlab package. A experimental study is conducted to demonstrate how to apply proposed RD approach in practice and how can it be used to improve the quality of generic drug for meeting statistical criteria of bioequivalence tests.					3rd International Conference on the Development of Biomedical Engineering in Vietnam3rd International Conference on the Development of Biomedical Engineering in Vietnam	JAN 11-14, 2010JAN 11-14, 2010		Ho Chi Minh City, VIETNAMHo Chi Minh City, VIETNAM	0	0	0	0	0	0			1680-0737		978-3-642-12019-0	WOS:000307677500017

However, high levels of leakage dramatically reduce the economic impact of such tourism. While the problem of economic leakage in rural peripheries is well documented, there is a paucity of research on strategies to reduce leakage. Strategies that can be employed at the village level may be especially useful as they do not require the co-operation of outside stakeholders who may profit from the leakage out of the village. This study identifies three such strategies employed in rural villages in northern Thailand and uses the case-study method to evaluate their effectiveness. It concludes with a discussion of the applicability of these strategies to other locations.									21	0	0	2	0	21			1461-6688			WOS:000274373400004

The Impact of Visa-free Entry on Outbound Tourism: A Case Study of South Korean Travellers Visiting Japan								TOURISM GEOGRAPHIES				12	2			302	323	PII 922930265	10.1080/14616681003727991			2010	2010	Although visa-free entry is important to tourism flows across borders there has been limited academic research into the effects of this arrangement on international tourism demand. Using the ARIMA, the ARIMA intervention, Winters Exponential Smoothing and the Stepwise Autoregressive models, this study examined the effect of visa-free entry on tourism demand between South Korea and Japan, and estimated the impact of this visa-free travel on tourism numbers and receipts. The results showed that for Koreans visiting Japan, introducing visa-free travel was statistically significant with a positive sign. In the first year tourists increased by 12.1 percent and receipts by $US246 million and in the second year tourists increased by 25 percent and receipts by $US792 million. The key finding is that in a market with strong effective demand, the influence of a change to visa-free entry could be greater than 20 percent. However, as individual, national and external reasons modulate each context, further research into the influence of visa controls on various established tourism markets is recommended.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1461-6688			WOS:000278723600007		
J	Ogden, C. A.; Ileleji, K. E.; Richardson, F.								MORPHOLOGICAL PROPERTIES AND BREAKAGE BEHAVIOR OF THREE GROUND BIOFEEDSTOCKS BY HAMMERMILLING								TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE				53	1			199	204					JAN-FEB 2010	2010	Size reduction is one of the most important first steps during processing of biofeedstocks for food, feed, fuel, or fiber production. Size reduction improves conversion processes because of the creation of larger reactive surface areas, and it is also used to improve material handling in the process. This study investigated the particle size, particle size distribution, and morphological changes of three biofeedstocks (switchgrass, corn kernels, and soybean seeds) ground by hammermilling through three screen sizes (6.4 mm, 3.2 mm, and 1.6 mm). Feedstock particle size was analyzed based on both screen size and feedstock type. Significant differences were found among screen sizes; however, particle size differences among feedstock types were only significant for material passing through 6.4 mm and 3.2 mm screens. Of the three feedstocks, ground corn exhibited the smallest particle size as expressed by its geometric mean diameter (d(wg)), while soybean seeds exhibited the largest dwg. The morphological features of all the feedstocks, expressed as circularity, roundness, and aspect ratio, did not change significantly, as was initially hypothesized. While ground switchgrass had very high aspect ratios (10 to 12) and low circularity (0.20) and roundness (0.10), the opposite was seen for ground corn and soybean, which exhibited more spherical particles. It was concluded that the breakage behavior of biofeedstocks is an inherent material property that changes very little with size reduction by hammermilling.

The Clemson University campus, in South Carolina, was used as a case study to determine the ability of roadside parking information systems to reduce delay, cut travel time, and manage changing volumes of cars. To examine these effects, a traffic simulation model of the campus was built, calibrated, and validated. The model used a dynamic assignment approach to capture the rerouting of vehicles in response to parking availability information for several key parking lots. It was found that use of roadside parking information systems, such as dynamic message signs, can reduce delay while not significantly affecting volumes, travel times, or speeds. The findings suggested that delay reduction was caused by a decrease in vehicle circulation time.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0361-1981			WOS:000287791000001

Past efforts to produce RHA have yielded ashes, some with high carbon content and others with some crystalline silica, neither of which is desirable for use of RHA as a pozzolan. Within the past decade, the production of off-white-colored RHA containing high levels of amorphous silica and very little carbon has become possible through innovations in incineration techniques. Results are presented from a study conducted to ascertain the properties of a low-carbon-content RHA and evaluate it as a supplementary cementing material. In addition, the as-obtained RHA was ground to a smaller particle size to study the effect of finer ash on properties of cementitious mixtures. Specific tests conducted include pozzolanic reactivity and microstructure of RHA and other properties of cementitious pastes and mortars. These include flow, initial and final setting time, compressive strength, flexural strength, and split tensile strength. In addition, other tests such as water absorption, effective porosity, and rapid chloride ion permeability were conducted to ascertain the improvements offered by RHA in enhancing durability of cementitious mixes. Comparative studies were conducted with silica fume mixes. Results from this study are very encouraging and suggest that RHA produced with a consistent quality (i.e., high amorphous silica content and low carbon content) can serve as an environmentally friendly and sustainable supplement for cementitious material needs in future; it can reduce the carbon footprint of concrete.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0361-1981			WOS:000284728900004

A case study was performed to compare the contributions of green construction credits and those of environmentally sustainable traffic operations to reducing energy use and emissions. The study measured the impacts of green credits by using the Carnegie Mellon University economic input output life-cycle assessment model. These impacts were compared with those achieved through sustainable traffic operation strategies, consisting of a high-occupancy vehicle lane and access to public transit. The study shows that the energy and emissions reductions obtained by use of the traffic operation strategies eclipsed those obtained by use of the green credit measures in just 1 month of traffic operations. The carbon dioxide emissions created and the total energy consumed by only 1 month of traffic were three times greater and 30% more, respectively, than those obtained by repaving the same roadway. In addition to reducing emissions, environmentally sustainable traffic operations offer social sustainability benefits, such as reducing traffic delays and improving flow, which reduce the demand for transportation infrastructure and which can ultimately reduce the need for new roadway construction. Although both green credit measures and environmentally sustainable traffic operations are essential to true sustainability, the relative impacts of both traffic operations and construction credits should be considered when research and infrastructure investments are prioritized.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0361-1981			WOS:000284728800013		
J	Kanhere, Neeraj K.; Birchfield, Stanley T.; Sarasua, Wayne A.; Khoeini, Sara								Traffic Monitoring of Motorcycles During Special Events Using Video Detection								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD					2160			69	76		10.3141/2160-08			2010	2010	Because of a recent federal initiative, states are required to submit motorcycle vehicle miles traveled data to the FHWA. Data are needed to obtain better counts of motorcycles to evaluate their impact on crashes and traffic flow, but there is concern about the quality of data. Many states have identified problems with automatic traffic recorders accounting for motorcycle traffic. Existing sensors exhibit difficulties counting motorcycles that travel side by side or close behind each other, they have difficulty distinguishing larger motorcycles from passenger vehicles, and magnetic counters in particular do not sense motorcycles that do not pass over or travel close enough to sensors. Alternatively, some states conduct manual classification counts, which are labor intensive and lead to sparse data. Because classification counts are frequently conducted during the week, they do not capture weekend numbers. This paper evaluates a video-based traffic monitoring system that was developed at Clemson University and can classify vehicles, including motorcycles. The processor uses vehicle tracking, rather than virtual detection, to collect vehicle count, speed, and classification data. An algorithm calculates a motorcycle's (l)ength, width, and height through a series of frames. The system is evaluated by using traffic data for more than 2,000 motorcycles, collected at two locations in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, during a motorcycle rally. The difference between actual and system motorcycle counts ranged from 0.6% to just over 6%, depending on direction and location. The difference for all vehicles ranged from 0.25% to 3.6%. While the system successfully classifies motorcycles traveling in close pairs and in small groups, it experienced difficulty in cases of severe occlusion.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0361-1981			WOS:000282834800008		
J	Xiao, Feipeng; Amirkhanian, Serji N.; Putman, Bradley J.								Evaluation of Rutting Resistance in Warm-Mix Asphalts Containing Moist Aggregate								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD					2180			75	84		10.3141/2180-09			2010	2010	In recent years, rising energy prices and more stringent environmental regulations have resulted in an interest in warns-mix asphalt (WMA) technologies to decrease the energy consumption and emissions associated with conventional hot-mix asphalt production. In this study, the objective was to conduct a laboratory investigation of rutting resistance in WMA mixtures containing moist aggregates. Rut depth, weight loss, and gyration number of dry and conditioned specimens were measured for all of the mixtures. The experimental design included two aggregate moisture contents (0% and similar to 0.5% by weight of the dry mass of the aggregate), two lime contents (1% and 2% lime by weight of dry aggregate), three WMA additives (Aspha-min, Sasobit, and Evotherm), and three aggregate sources. Thirty-six mixtures were prepared, and 216 specimens were tested in this study. Test results indicated that the aggregate source significantly affects the rutting resistance regardless of the WMA additive, lime content, and moisture content. In addition, rut depth of the mixture containing moist aggregate generally satisfies the demand of pavement performance without additional treatment. The mixture with Sasobit additive exhibited the best rutting resistance. The mixtures containing Aspha-min and Evotherm additives generally showed a rut resistance similar to that of the control mixture.									34	0	0	0	0	34			0361-1981			WOS:000287776500009		
J	Duanmu, Jun; Taaffe, Kevin; Chowdhury, Mashrur								Minimizing Patient Transport Times During Mass Population Evacuations								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD					2196			150	158		10.3141/2196-16			2010	2010	Emergency evacuation in a health care environment has focused on methods for evacuating a facility, resources for transferring patients, and sufficient capacity at sheltering facilities. What has been overlooked is the interaction between health care facility evacuation and any communitywide evacuation that would result in significant roadway congestion. This paper focuses on how to route hospital vehicles during a hurricane evacuation. To provide an analytical comparison of evacuation time, delay, and routes across various evacuation scenarios, a simulation model is developed that combines hospital and general population traffic. The tailored model incorporates mesoscopic traffic flow concepts to evaluate a region covering several hundred miles with the ability to control speeds and make decisions at the individual vehicle level. With this novel modeling approach, evacuation planners can easily program the routes, test the travel times, and quickly consider different scenarios. It can be a useful tool for hospital evacuation planners and statewide or regional evacuation planners making decisions about traffic operational strategies. The analysis includes consideration of the evacuation of the Charleston, South Carolina, metropolitan area during a hurricane threat. The study found that to evacuate all patients 6 h before a hurricane landfall, the hospital evacuation must start at least 12 h before the mandatory evacuation order (a typical 24-h notice). Alternatively, the hospital evacuation can take place at the same time as the mandatory evacuation if both begin 48 h before landfall.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0361-1981			WOS:000287995100016

J	Bartens, Julia; Wiseman, P. Eric; Smiley, E. Thomas								Stability of landscape trees in engineered and conventional urban soil mixes								URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING				9	4			333	338		10.1016/j.ufug.2010.06.005			2010	2010	Urban trees are frequently exposed to unsuitable soil conditions that can hamper root system development, potentially affecting both tree health and stability. Engineered soil designs have been developed to increase soil volume for trees planted in confined spaces, and past research has shown that these designs improve growing conditions. However, tree stability in these engineered soils has received limited attention from researchers. In this study, we evaluated the stability of two tree species of contrasting soil quality tolerance (Prunus serrulata and Ulmus parvifolia) after 3 years growth in two skeletal soil mixes, in a suspended pavement design (uncompacted soil), and in a conventionally prepared soil pit. Tree stability was evaluated by measuring trunk resistance to a lateral deflecting force applied with a rope winch system under both ambient and near-saturated soil conditions. Although heavily irrigating the experimental soils had no effect on tree stability, species-specific responses to soil mixes were observed. P. serrulata grown in the gravel-based skeletal soil showed greater trunk deflection resistance than trees grown in the other soil treatments, yet the stability of U. parvifolia was unaffected by soil type. These species-specific responses were consistent with earlier observations of root development in which P. serrulata grew up to 60 times greater root length in gravel-based skeletal soil whereas U. parvifolia root growth was similar in all soil treatments. This research provides evidence that certain tree species planted in conventional tree pits may be more prone to uprooting due to poor root development and that root anchorage might be improved for these species by utilizing a skeletal soil mix.

S	Faust, J. E.; Lewis, K. P.; Rapaka, V. K.						Erkan, M; Aksoy, U		Identifying the Storage Potential of Unrooted Shoot-Tip Cuttings of Eight Ornamental Species								VI INTERNATIONAL POSTHARVEST SYMPOSIUM		Acta Horticulturae		877				1771	1776					2010	2010	Unrooted cuttings are typically produced in tropical climates and shipped via air freight to North American and European markets. Shipments usually occur during 3 to 4 days per week, since customers do not desire to receive cuttings on Friday, Saturday or Sunday. Thus, the number of days per week to actually harvest cuttings is limited unless those cuttings can be held in storage prior to shipment. The objective of this project was to identify the storage potential of the following eight ornamental species: Artemisia xhybrida, Angelonia angustifolia, Diascia xhybrida, Gaura lindheimeri, Ipomea batatas, Nemesia xhybrida, Solenostemon scutellarioides and Verbena xhybrida. Cuttings were harvested from stock plants and placed at 0, 5, 10, 15 or 20 degrees C for 2, 4, 6 or 8 days and then placed into a simulated shipping environment for two days. A control group of cuttings was not stored and only received the simulated shipping treatment. Roots and shoots were visually rated after three weeks in propagation. Angelonia and Solenstemon were the least cold tolerant species, e. g., they had damaged tissue after 2 days storage at 0 degrees C. Angelonia, Diascia, Gaura and Nemesia were the least heat tolerant species, e.g., they did not perform well in propagation following for more than 2 days of storage at 20 degrees C. While the optimal temperature varied from 5 to 15 degrees C for each species, all species performed well at this temperature range following 2 to 4 days of storage. This work suggests that cutting suppliers can harvest cuttings every day of the week and ship the cuttings only 1 to 2 days per week. This creates the opportunity for companies to minimize the number of trained cutters that need to be employed and to minimize transportation costs by consolidating orders harvested throughout the week into a minimum number of shipments.					6th International Postharvest Symposium6th International Postharvest Symposium	APR 08-12, 2009APR 08-12, 2009	Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)	Antalya, TURKEYAntalya, TURKEY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-90-6605-613-8	WOS:000323614700243

Unrooted cuttings were harvested from stock plants, placed in plastic bags at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, or 25 degrees C for 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, or 14 days, and then placed on a propagation bench for 21 days. Shoot quality was visually rated (1-5 scale: 1=dead, 5=excellent) immediately after storage, after one day in propagation, and at the end of propagation. Rooting quality was also given a visual rating (1-5 scale) at the end of propagation (Day 21). After 24 hours in propagation, chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm) was recorded for each treatment. Storage longevity was 10 days at 10 or 15 degrees C, 6 days at 5 degrees C, and 4 days at 0, 20 or 25 degrees C. Final cutting quality recorded at Day 21 was closely correlated to the chlorophyll fluorescence values recorded after one day in propagation. Currently, transportation of unrooted poinsettias from Central America to North America typically requires two days via airfreight. This project suggests that trans-oceanic carriers, which take up to 7 days for delivery, may be a feasible alternative shipping method provided that the optimal temperatures (10-15 degrees C) are maintained throughout the postharvest life.					6th International Postharvest Symposium6th International Postharvest Symposium	APR 08-12, 2009APR 08-12, 2009	Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)	Antalya, TURKEYAntalya, TURKEY	1	0	0	1	0	1			0567-7572		978-90-6605-613-8	WOS:000323614700247

Formation potential tests of samples obtained from various drinking water sources showed that ozonation-chlorination produced the highest HNM yields followed by in the order of chlorination, ozonation-chloramination, and chloramination. Similar or higher HNM yields were observed in the treated waters (i.e., after conventional water treatment) than in the raw waters, indicating that hydrophilic natural organic matter (NOM) components that are not effectively removed by conventional treatment processes are likely the main precursors of HNMs. This was further confirmed by examining HNM formation potentials of NOM fractions obtained with resin fractionation. Hydrophilic NOM fractions (HPI) showed significantly higher HNM yields than hydrophobic (HPO) and transphilic (TPH) fractions. The correlation analysis of HNM formation potentials during ozonation-chlorination with various water quality parameters showed the best correlation between the HNM yields and the ratio of dissolved organic carbon to dissolved organic nitrogen concentrations in the water samples tested.

Increasing the shading from 0 to 87% decreased germination of fresh, viable seeds in dark front 25 to 12%. Abscisic acid (ABA) content of seeds from plants in 0% shade increased from 13.3 ng g(-1) dry seed to 19.1 ng g(-1) dry seed with 87% shade. Shading of the mother plant did not influence the 1,000-seed weight of Palmer amaranth. Seeds that matured in the top and middle third of the mother plant had 67 to 78% greater germination than those that matured in the bottom third of the mother plant. Endogenous gibberellic acid (GA) content of seeds did not differ between locations on the mother plant; however, the ABA content of seeds produced on the bottom third of the plant was 46 and 59% higher than the ABA content of seeds produced at the middle and top third of the plant, respectively. Endogenous ABA or GA content of seeds and 1,000-seed weight had no relationship with seed germination over and above the treatment effects. This research Suggests that shading and plant location can influence germination of fresh, viable seeds of Palmer amaranth, which will be a dormancy strategy for seed dispersal over time.									7	0	0	4	1	7			0043-1745			WOS:000273994100003

As such, the current chapter proposes a dual-process model to understand the causes of destructive leadership behavior (DLB). This model conceptualizes DLB as stemming from two psychological processes-a self-regulatory process which suggests the importance of psychological resources and a social cognitive process based on the theory of planned behavior. The model also considers the roles that leaders' traits may play in these two processes. Specifically, we describe the direct and indirect influences of the five factor model, psychological resilience, and so-called "dark side" traits on supervisors' DLBs.									7	0	0	0	0	7					978-1-61735-067-2	WOS:000281006300006		
S	Reighard, G. L.; Ouellette, D.; Brock, K.						Costa, G		Dormant Applications of a Soybean Oil Adjuvant plus Ethephon Reduce Peach Flower Bud Survival								XI INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON PLANT BIOREGULATORS IN FRUIT PRODUCTION		Acta Horticulturae		884				629	634					2010	2010	Early removal of flower buds, flowers or small fruitlets increases peach fruit size and commercial value. Due to the lack of labeled or consistent thinning chemicals, peach growers usually wait similar to 30 days after bloom before hand-thinning fruit, which decreases fruit growth potential. Experiments were conducted near Seneca, South Carolina to determine the efficacy of combining Vegetoil (R) (VO), an emulsified soybean oil adjuvant (93% soybean oil), with Ethrel (R) (E) (a.i. 21.7% Ethephon) for pre-bloom killing of peach flower buds. 'Contender', 'Cresthaven' and 'Rubyprince' peach trees were sprayed once in January 2008 with 10% VO containing Ethephon concentrations of 25 (only 'Rubyprince'), 50 or 75 ppm. Dormant oil (DO) at 3% and VO at 10% were the control treatments. In 2009, 10% VO with 75 ppm Ethephon was sprayed on 'Cresthaven' and 'Rubyprince' trees on either 1 of 5 different dates ranging from 12 January to 16 February. In 2008, Vegetoil (R) reduced 'Contender', 'Cresthaven' and 'Rubyprince' flower bud survival by 10, 20 and 30%, respectively compared to the DO control and by 20-25, 50-60, and 45-55%, respectively when VO was combined with different Ethephon concentrations. The VO plus E treatments reduced fruit yield by 25-35% in 'Cresthaven' and 45-60% in 'Rubyprince' compared to the DO control. 'Rubyprince' yield was also significantly affected (i.e., reduced) because of a late spring freeze. 'Contender' fruit yield was only slightly reduced by the Vegetoil (R) plus Ethephon treatments. Mean fruit size increased 10-15% with the VO and E treatments. The 2009 flower bud survival, fruit set and yield were significantly reduced by the VO plus E treatments for all application times.

PPV natural resistance has been only found in some North American apricot cultivars and efforts are being made to introduce this character on Mediterranean germplasm.Recent studies on segregation of different intraspecific apricot crosses suggest that PPV resistance is controlled by at least one major dominant locus on the upper part of linkage group 1 (LG1). Using microsatellites already mapped in different Prunus spp. we have built a high density genetic map for an interval of 13 cM comprising this region in apricot. In addition, overgo probes designed from SSR clone sequences have been used to screen an apricot Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) library. Positive clones identified are being used to construct a BAC contig spanning the apricot genomic region containing the PPV resistance locus using the peach physical map developed by Zhebentyayeva et al. (2008) as reference.					14th International Symposium on Apricot Breeding and Culture14th International Symposium on Apricot Breeding and Culture	JUN 16-20, 2008JUN 16-20, 2008	Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)	Matera, ITALYMatera, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-90-66053-56-4	WOS:000313516500073

Forest soils with high levels of organic carbon are a potential terrestrial source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into the East River. DOC is of great concern, since it can form carcinogenic disinfection byproducts (DBPs) during drinking water treatment. In this study, soils from three altitudes (200, 450 and 900 m) in the Xiangtou Mountain Nature Reserve in South China, representing soils from evergreen moon forest, transitional evergreen broadleaf forest, and evergreen broadleaf forest, respectively, were evaluated for their potential contributions of DBP precursors into the East River. The water extractable organic carbon (WEOC) in three forest soils was physically and chemically fractionated into particulate organic carbon (1.2-0.45 mm), colloidal organic carbon (0.45-0.22 mu m), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (<0.22 mu m), hydrophobic acid (HPOA), transphilic acid and hydrophilic acid and were analysed for the formation potentials of trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetonitriles (HANs), and chloral hydrate (CHD). Also, soils were incubated at 15, 25 and 35 degrees C for 14 d in darkness to examine the impact of temperature effects on the availability and characteristics of WEOC. The extraction study showed that the amount of WEOC was proportional to soil organic carbon content, of which about 1% was water extractable. Regardless of soil type, DOC and HPOA were the most reactive fractions in forming THMs, CHD, and HANs. Production of DOC and HPOA in WEOC increased over 14 d incubation as incubation temperature increased, but the temperature did not alter the distribution of physical and chemical fractions and their reactivity in DBP formation. Results suggest higher inputs of DOC and DBP precursors from forest watersheds into source water may result in a warmer environment. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Nanoparticles composed of conjugated polymers possess high absorption cross sections, high radiative rates, and low or moderate aggregation quenching, resulting in extraordinarily high fluorescent brightness. The bright fluorescence (similar to 200 000 photons detected per particle per 20 ms exposure) yields a theoretical particle tracking uncertainty of less than 1 nm. A lateral tracking uncertainty of 1-2 nm was determined from analysis of trajectories of fixed and freely diffusing particles. Axial (Z) position information for 3D particle tracking was obtained by defocused imaging. Nanoscale tracking of single particles in fixed cells was demonstrated, and a range of complex behaviors, possibly due to binding/unbinding dynamics, were observed.									71	1	0	15	0	72			0002-7863			WOS:000273615800053	20028148

Subjects rotated the arm in elbow configurations that yielded either a constant or variable separation between these axes. We hypothesized that increasing the motion frequency and the task complexity would result in the limbs' rotational axis to correspond to e(3) in order to minimize rotational resistances. Results showed two velocity-dependent profiles wherein the rotation axis coincided with the SH-EL axis for S and I velocities and then in the IF velocity shifted to either a SH-CM/e(3) trade-off axis for one profile, or to no preferential axis for the other. A third profile was velocity-independent, with the SH-CM/e(3) trade-off axis being adopted. Our results are the first to provide evidence that the rotational axis of a multi-articulated limb may change from a geometrical axis of rotation to a mass or inertia based axis as motion frequency increases. These findings are discussed within the framework of the minimum inertia tensor model (MIT), which shows that rotations about e(3) reduce the amount of joint muscle torque that must be produced by employing the interaction torque to assist movement.

The enhanced solubility of CMP1 can be traced to the prevention of coordinative crosslinking between polymer chains. The sterically enforced 1:1 bipy/metal ratio was confirmed by job analysis of absorption spectroscopic titration data. In addition to enhanced processability, this strategy also leads to twice as many metal ions, and consequently twice the charge, on CMP1 versus traditional bipyridyl-PPV metallopolymers that are typified by a 2:1 bipy/metal ratio with certain metals.									10	0	0	1	0	10			1022-1336			WOS:000273440300002	21638497

Very little work has been done on particle electrophoretic motions in real microchannels that may have one OF Multiple turns for reducing the devices size or achieving other functions. This article presents an experimental and numerical study of particle electrophoresis in curved microchannels. Polystyrene microparticles are found to migrate across streamlines and flow out of a spiral microchannel in a focused stream near the Outer wall. This transverse focusing effect arises from the dielectrophoretic particle motion induced by the non-uniform electric field intrinsic to curved channels. The experimental observations agree quantitatively with the numerical predictions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.									45	0	0	26	0	45			0021-9797			WOS:000271310200021	19782995

Assessing the Influence of Adsorbed-State Conformation on the Bioactivity of Adsorbed Enzyme Layers								LANGMUIR				25	24			13926	13933		10.1021/la900799m			DEC 15 2009	2009	Systems using immobilized enzymes are attractive for a wide range of industrial and medical applications because they allow for the fabrication of stable, reusable substrates with highly specific functionality. The performance of these systems is greatly dependent upon the orientation and conformation of the adsorbed enzymes. To investigate these relationships, we have developed and applied methods to quantitatively assess the secondary structure of adsorbed enzyme layers on planar surfaces using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and evaluate their bioactivity using colorimetric assays. These combined measurements provide molecular-level insights regarding whether observed changes in adsorbed enzyme bioactivity are due to the adsorbed orientation of an enzyme or adsorption-induced changes in its conformation. Using this approach, we investigated the adsorption behavior of lysozyme (HEWL), xylanase (XYL), and glucose oxidase (GOx) on OH-, CH3-. NH2-, and COOH-terminated alkanethiol self-assembled monolayer (SAM) surfaces. The bioactivities of small enzymes HEWL and XYL had pronounced variations between the different SAM surfaces despite their structural stability, highlighting the role of adsorbed orientation on bioactivity. In contrast, GOx, which is a much larger enzyme, exhibited wide variations in both its structure and bioactivity after adsorption, with adsorption-induced conformational changes actually enhancing its bioactivity. These results provide new insights into protein-surface interactions at the molecular level and demonstrate that adsorption can either promote or inhibit bioactivity depending on how the surface chemistry influences the orientation and conformational state of the enzyme on the surface.									35	1	0	12	0	36			0743-7463			WOS:000272394400032	19499935

There are situations, for example, when sampling from finite populations, where resampling with out replacement provides a more realistic bootstrap procedure and produces dependent bootstrap random variables. The desired properties of consistency and asymptotic validity are shown to hold for certain nonparametric dependent boot strap estimators. In addition, it is shown that the smaller variation independent boot strap estimators can be used to increase precision in some of the estimators. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

BMC proceedings				3 Suppl 7				S13	S13					2009 Dec 15	2009	The North American Rheumatoid Arthritis Consortium case-control study collected case participants across the United States and control participants from New York. More than 500,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in the sample of 2000 cases and controls. Careful adjustment for the confounding effect of population stratification must be conducted when analyzing these data; the variance inflation factor (VIF) without adjustment is 1.44. In the primary analyses of these data, a clustering algorithm in the program PLINK was used to reduce the VIF to 1.14, after which genomic control was used to control residual confounding. Here we use stratification scores to achieve a unified and coherent control for confounding. We used the first 10 principal components, calculated genome-wide using a set of 81,500 loci that had been selected to have low pair-wise linkage disequilibrium, as risk factors in a logistic model to calculate the stratification score. We then divided the data into five strata based on quantiles of the stratification score. The VIF of these stratified data is 1.04, indicating substantial control of stratification. However, after control for stratification, we find that there are no significant loci associated with rheumatoid arthritis outside of the HLA region. In particular, we find no evidence for association of TRAF1-C5 with rheumatoid arthritis.									6	1	0	4	0	7				1753-6561		MEDLINE:20017996	20017996	
J	Medlock, Jan; Meyers, Lauren Ancel; Galvani, Alison								Optimizing allocation for a delayed influenza vaccination campaign.								PLoS currents				1				RRN1134	RRN1134					2009 Dec 09	2009	During unexpected infectious disease outbreaks, public health agencies must make effective use of limited resources. Vaccine distribution may be delayed and staggered through time, as underscored by the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Using a mathematical model parametrized with data from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, we found that optimal allocations of vaccine among people in different age groups and people with high-risk conditions depends on the schedule of vaccine availability relative to the progress of the epidemic. For the projected schedule of H1N1 vaccine availability, the optimal strategy to reduce influenza-related deaths is to initial target high-risk people, followed by school-aged children (5-17) and then young adults (18-44). The optimal strategy to minimize hospitalizations, however, is to target ages 5-44 throughout the vaccination campaign, with only a tiny amount of vaccine used on high-risk people. We find that optimizing at each vaccine release time independently does not give the overall optimal strategy. In this manuscript, we derive policy recommendations for 2009 H1N1 vaccine allocation using a mathematical model. In addition, our optimization procedures, which consider staggered releases over the entire epidemic altogether, are applicable to other outbreaks where not all supplies are available initially.									0	0	0	0	0	0				2157-3999		MEDLINE:20033093	20033093

The former measured state parameters of the layer (plasma density, temperature, and composition) while the latter observed small-scale plasma waves and the associated quasiperiodic (QP) echoes. Regularization was used to estimate horizontal vector ion drifts from Arecibo line-of-sight data. Assuming the ion temperatures and drifts to be representative of the neutral atmospheric temperatures and drifts in the mesosphere lower-thermosphere (MLT) region, we evaluated the Richardson number criterion for neutral dynamic instability in regions occupied by the layers. We find that the condition for instability was generally satisfied and thus that dynamic instability is consistent with the layer breakup. The electrodynamics of the resulting patchy layers could then give rise to the QP echoes.									15	0	0	0	0	15			2169-9380	2169-9402		WOS:000272446900001

Numerous simulations are performed for a wide range of fabrication temperatures (973.15-1273.15 K) as well as different CH(4) (500-1000 sccm) and H(2) (250-750 sccm) flow rates. The effect of temperature, total flow rate, and feed mixture ratio on CNTs growth rate as well as the effect of amorphous carbon formation on the final product are calculated and compared with experimental results. The outcomes from this study provide a fundamental understanding and basis for the design of an efficient CNT fabrication process that is capable of producing a high yield of CNTs, with a minimum amount of amorphous carbon.

Here, we examined whether bonobos and chimpanzee differ in selected brain regions that may map to these different social and cognitive abilities. Eight chimpanzees and eight bonobos matched on age, sex and rearing experiences were magnetic resonance images scanned and volumetric measures were obtained for the whole brain, cerebellum, striatum, motor-hand area, hippocampus, inferior frontal gyrus and planum temporale. Chimpanzees had significantly larger cerebellum and borderline significantly larger hippocampus and putamen, after adjusting for brain size, compared with bonobos. Bonobos showed greater leftward asymmetries in the striatum and motor-hand area compared with chimpanzees. No significant differences in either the volume or lateralization for the so-called language homologs were found between species. The results suggest that the two species of Pan are quite similar neurologically, though some volumetric and lateralized differences may reflect inherent differences in social organization, cognition and motor skills.

Kenneth								Metals analysis of botanical products in various matrices using a single microwave digestion and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) method								ANALYTICAL METHODS				1	3			188	194		10.1039/b9ay00080a			DEC 2009	2009	Presented here is the development and validation of a simple and singular sample preparation method for the detection of heavy metals (i.e. arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury) and other elements (i.e. iron, sodium, calcium, phosphorus, and zinc) in botanical products by microwave digestion and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). This one methodology is successfully applied to botanical samples existing in three very different forms; powdered raw material, liquid phyto-caps (i.e. glycerin-based matrices) and ethanolic tinctures. Method validation results were obtained by the generation of calibration curves with multi-element aqueous standard solutions and a standard addition method. NIST standard reference material (SRM) 3241 Ephedra sinica Stapf Native Extract, SRM 3243 Ephedra-Containing Solid Oral Dosage Form and SRM 3246 Ginkgo biloba (leaves) were used for the method validation. Limits of detection obtained from the calibration functions range from 4 to 100 ng/mL. Concentration ranges determined for the various botanical extracts were as follows: iron (1-434 mu g/g), sodium (3-6742 mu g/g), calcium (4-46537 mu g/g), phosphorus (24-14710 mu g/g), and zinc (7-7247 mu g/g). For the majority of the heavy metals (As, Cd, Hg and Pb) the concentration results were not detectable (ND), i.e. below the detection limits of the method.									11	1	0	5	0	11			1759-9660			WOS:000275164800005

Efficacy of a commercially available post-thaw bovine semen sexing kit in both single-ovulating and hyperstimulated cows								ANIMAL REPRODUCTION SCIENCE				116	3-4			376	380		10.1016/j.anireprosci.2009.01.012			DEC 2009	2009	Currently, there are few inexpensive, reliable, effective methods for commercially separating X- and Y-chromosome bearing fresh and frozen bovine sperm. The objective of these experiments was to determine the efficacy of a commercially available post-thaw bovine semen sexing kit, HeiferPlus (TM) (HP) which claims to alter the sex ratio in favor of female calves following artificial insemination. Three trials included the insemination of hyperstimulated cows with Control or HP-treated semen, non-surgical embryo collection on Day 7, and a combined PCR/dot blot assay to determine embryo sex. Chi-square analysis showed that the Control group produced a greater proportion (p < 0.0005) of female embryos than the HP group. There were no differences in the proportions of transferable compared with degenerate embryos or in number of ovulations, embryos, and unfertilized ova collected from Control compared with HP groups. When treatments were combined, one of the two bulls used in the hyperstimulation studies produced an overall greater proportion of females (p < 0.05), suggesting a bull effect. Another trial involved the insemination of cows synchronized via OvSynch (R) with fetal sexing via ultrasonography. Results of these studies indicated that HP semen sexing kit did not alter the sex ratio in favor of females in either hyperstimulated or single-ovulating cows; however, potential bull effects may be further evaluated to understand the capacity of HP with semen from specific bulls. Additionally, perhaps the sex of the surviving embryo can be manipulated by the maternal side, through ovarian, hormonal, oviductal, or uterine influences. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

It identifies both new ventures and incumbent firms as the mechanisms that penetrate the knowledge filter. Recent empirical work has shown that new firms are more proficient at penetrating the knowledge filter than are incumbent firms; however, the analysis has only examined expanding economies and has relied on purely cross-sectional regression methodologies. This study explores the role of new and incumbent firms in penetrating the knowledge filter utilizing recent developments in spatial panel estimation techniques to provide a more robust set of findings. The results suggest those new firms are more proficient at penetrating the knowledge filter in declining and growing regions alike.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0570-1864	1432-0592		WOS:000270978500010

We investigate the optical/near-infrared light curve of the afterglow of GRB 080710 in the context of rising afterglows.Methods. Optical and near-infrared photometry was performed using the seven-channel imager GROND and the Tautenburg Schmidt telescope. X-ray data were provided by the X-ray Telescope onboard the Swift satellite. We construct an empirical light curve model using the available broadband data, which is well-sampled in the time and frequency domains.Results. The optical/NIR light curve of the afterglow of GRB 080710 is dominated by an initial increase in brightness, which smoothly turns over into a shallow power law decay. At around 10 ks post-burst, there is an achromatic break from shallow to steeper decline in the afterglow light curve with a change in the power law index of Delta alpha similar to 0.9.Conclusions. The initially rising achromatic light curve of the afterglow of GRB 080710 can be accounted for with a model of a burst viewed off-axis or a single jet in its pre-deceleration phase and in an on-axis geometry. A unified picture of the afterglow light curve and prompt emission properties can be obtained with an off-axis geometry, suggesting that late and shallow rising optical light curves of GRB afterglows might be produced by geometric effects.									30	0	0	0	0	30			1432-0746			WOS:000273296700007

The radio galaxy NGC 1275 was recently observed by VERITAS at energies above 100 GeV for about 8 hr. No VHE gamma-ray emission was detected by VERITAS from NGC 1275. A 99% confidence level upper limit of 2.1% of the Crab Nebula flux level is obtained at the decorrelation energy of approximately 340 GeV, corresponding to 19% of the power-law extrapolation of the Fermi Large Area Telescope result.									17	0	0	0	0	17						WOS:000273132700015

Electrostatic effects represent the strongest type of these interactions and the type that is most difficult to accurately represent because of their long-range influence. While many different methods have been developed to represent electrostatic interactions, the particle mesh Ewald summation (PME) method is generally considered to be the most accurate one for calculating these effects. However, the PME method was designed for systems with three-dimensional (3D) periodicity, and not for interfacial systems such as the case of protein adsorption to a charged surface. Interfacial systems such as these have only two-dimensional periodicity, which may not be appropriate for treatment with PME due to the possibility that the presence of multiple charged image surfaces parallel to the primary simulation cell's surface, may introduce nonphysical effects on the behavior of the charged molecules in the system. In an effort to address this issue, the authors have conducted a set of nanosecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations to calculate the equilibrium distribution of Na(+) and Cl(-) ions near a charged surface using PME and a range of radial cutoff methods for treating electrostatic interactions, where the cutoffs prevent interaction with the periodic images of the system. The resulting ion concentration profiles were compared to one another and to a continuum analytical solution of the theoretical ion distribution obtained from the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. Their results show that the PME method does not introduce the suspected nonphysical effects in the ion distributions due to the 3D periodic images of the system, thus indicating that it is appropriate for use for this type of molecular simulation. Although their interest is motivated by protein-surface interactions, the conclusions are applicable for the treatment of electrostatics in other aqueous systems with two-dimensional periodicity. c 2009 American Vacuum Society.

Previous work has focused on thinning methods and classical time series autoregressive moving-average difference equations; in contrast, our methods use a renewal process to generate a correlated sequence of Bernoulli trials. By superpositioning independent copies of such processes, stationary series with binomial, Poisson, geometric or any other discrete marginal distribution can be readily constructed. The model class proposed is parsimonious, non-Markov and readily generates series with either short- or long-memory autocovariances. The model can be fitted with linear prediction techniques for stationary series. As an example, a stationary series with binomial marginal distributions is fitted to the number of rainy days in 210 consecutive weeks at Key West, Florida.									14	1	0	0	0	15			0006-3444			WOS:000272179100002

Inactivation of Salmonella spp. in cow manure composts formulated to different initial C:N ratios								BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY				100	23			5898	5903		10.1016/j.biortech.2009.06.083			DEC 2009	2009	Aerobic composting is a common management practice to inactivate pathogens in manure; however, additional research on the role of compost composition in pathogen inactivation is needed. The objective of this study was therefore to determine the effect of the carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratio and the presence of ammonium sulfate on inactivation of Salmonella spp. in cow manure-based mixtures composted in a bioreactor under controlled conditions. Compost preparations with an initial C:N ratio of 20:1 required a maximum of 4 days of storage before Salmonellae were inactivated by 7 log(10), whereas preparations with C:N ratios of 30:1 and 40:1 C:N required more than 5 and 7 days of storage, respectively. The pH values of both the 20:1 and 30:1 C:N preparations decreased during the onset of composting before increasing to >8. In contrast, pH values of 40:1 C:N preparations increased immediately to >8, generally within the first day of storage. Maximum temperatures observed in 20:1 C:N preparations for inactivation of pathogens were less than 50 degrees C, and the cumulative heat exposure required for pathogen inactivation in 20:1 C:N preparations was 15-fold less than in 40:1 C:N preparations. Supplementation of compost mixtures with 0.08% ammonium sulfate resulted in slightly higher temperatures; however, these higher temperatures did not translate into more rapid rates of pathogen inactivation.

The absorption efficiency and respiration rate of the Florida Lancelet, Branchiostoma floridae								COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY A-MOLECULAR & INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY				154	4			570	574		10.1016/j.cbpa.2009.09.007			DEC 2009	2009	The present study investigates some aspects of the digestive biology and physiological energetics of the Florida lancelet, Branchiostoma floridae. Florida lancelets are able to remove 47.2-56.9% of the energy from a diet of mixed algae. The respiration rate is 0.100 mL O(2) (STPD) h(-1) g(-1) (wet), which estimates a metabolic rate of 0.248 J h(-1), at an average body mass of 0.125 g (wet). Published values of the chlorophyll a concentration in its natural habitat indicate that a 125 mg lancelet would need to filter 0.018-0.031 L h(-1) to remove sufficient food to support its resting metabolism. The filtration rate of lancelets has been reported as 0.138 L h(-1), indicating that the actual filtration rate is 4-7 times greater than the filtration rate needed to meet resting metabolic demands. It appears that lancelets have the potential to be raised in aquaculture, because their absorption efficiency and respiration rate are comparable to suspension-feeding invertebrates that have been successfully aquacultured.

In this work, a framework for probabilistic assessment of landslide is presented with a focus on the El Berrinche landslide, Honduras. One unique feature of this case study involving the El Berrinche landslide is that the stability analysis has to be carried out with limited data. Another challenge in this study is to assess possible remedial measures in a way that can easily be communicated to the government and the public. A reliability-based framework for a probabilistic assessment is proposed. With this approach, different levels of risk for landslide are assessed and the associated costs are estimated; and all information is integrated into the decision-making process for choosing a remedial action.									7	0	0	1	0	7			1866-6280			WOS:000274181100001

The speciation and bioavailability of copper (Cu) in MWNTs-associated NOM was studied using Daphnia magna. Cu titration data indicated that the binding affinity of Cu for MWNTs-associated NOM was lower than that for NOM alone. The free Cu(2+) ion activity was increased even by the addition of a low nontoxic concentration of 1.0 mg/L MWNTs. The 96 h LC(50) of MWNTs was determined to be 2.48 mg/L. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra results showed clearly different features in Cu spiked between NOM and MWNTs-associated NOM, indicating that the interruption of Cu binding was probably due to steric stabilization of the MWNTs dispersed in NOM, which inhibited the complexation by rendering the functional groups in NOM less favorable to Cu. The mortality and biochemical reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the D. magna bioassay were enhanced in MWNTs-associated NOM compared to NOM alone because of increased free Cu(2+) ion activity as expected from the titration and FTIR results. This study suggests the bioavailability of Cu is enhanced by the presence of MWNTs interacting with NOM.									47	2	0	38	0	49			0013-936X			WOS:000272038900050	19943676

They draw on four different samples of employees working in various organizations to: (a) generate items to measure POO, (b) assess the psychometric properties of the POO scale, (c) replicate the factor structure and other psychometric properties of the scale, (d) assess the discriminant validity with respect to existing measures of the employer-employee relationship, and (e) determine whether POO explains additional variance beyond existing constructs (perceived organizational support, psycholosgical contract breach, organizational politics, procedural justice, and organizational frustration) in the exit, voice, loyalty, and neglect framework. The results of this study indicate that the POO scale is internally consistent and unidimensional, demonstrates discriminant validity with respect to existing employer-employee relationship constructs, and explains additional variance in the exit, voice, loyalty, and neglect framework.									33	0	0	1	0	33			1059-6011			WOS:000272173000003

However, nothing is known about the potential of the GAFP lectin to confer disease resistance to the ring nematode, Mesocriconema xenoplax, in plum. Three transgenic plum lines (4I, 4J, and 5D) expressing gafp-1 under the control of CaMV 35S promoter sequence were evaluated for their response to M. xenoplax in the greenhouse. All plum lines were rated as hosts of M. xenoplax. Among the individual plum lines tested, the number of M. xenoplax per gram of dry roots was lowest in the rhizosphere of transgenic line 5D, intermediate in that of the nontransformed control line, and greatest in line 4J. The results of this study indicate that the comparisons of the final soil densities (Pf) of adult and juvenile M. xenoplax expressed as nematodes per gram of dry roots provide a better measure of the nematode carrying capacity by the tested lines than Pf values referred to as number of M. xenoplax/100 cm(3) soil.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0018-5345	2327-9834		WOS:000272751600022

The device is for eventual intramuscular implantation as an electrochemical biotransducer for the continuous amperometric monitoring of glucose and lactate in a vertebrate animal trauma model. The microfabricated ECC MDEA5037 comprises two discrete electrochemical cells-on-a-chip, each with a shared reference electrode, a discrete counter electrode, and an MDEA working electrode. Each MDEA consists of 37 openings, each 50 mu m in diameter, and separated within a hexagonal close packed array by center-on-center distances of 100 mu m. The 4 mm by 2 mm biotransducer was packaged for implantation and electrochemical signal acquisition by mounting onto a ceramic chip carrier to which it was gold wire-bonded and the chip carrier soldered to a five-conductor, shielded, silicone insulated hookup wire. Robust first level packaging was developed to withstand harsh chemical, elevated temperature and plasma surface treatments. The use of cross-linked SU-8 as a second level packaging layer reduced the qualifying device failure rate from 90% to almost < 1% (n = 65). Finally, the packaged biotransducer was coated with a layer of bioactive hydrogel as a means to confer molecular recognition, specificity and biocompatibility in preparation for implantation. Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), Electrical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), and microscopic examination were performed for packaged biochip qualification.									6	0	0	3	0	6			1530-437X			WOS:000271156400018

Time and Frequency Bias in Extrapolating Wideband Responses of Resonant Structures								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION				57	12			3934	3941		10.1109/TAP.2009.2033285			DEC 2009	2009	An improved technique is presented to extrapolate a wideband electromagnetic response of a resonant structure using only early-time and low-frequency computed data. The response is represented as a sum of weighted polynomials and pole terms. Previously, poles were estimated from early-time data. In this paper, poles are also estimated from low-frequency data and used to accurately extrapolate a response. A time or frequency bias is observed when estimating poles from either early-time or low-frequency data, respectively. It is shown that poles estimated from early-time and low-frequency data can be combined to reduce the amount of directly-computed data needed to accurately extrapolate a response.

J	Ma, Yongchang; Chowdhury, Mashrur; Sadek, Adel; Jeihani, Mansoureh								Real-Time Highway Traffic Condition Assessment Framework Using Vehicle-Infrastructure Integration (VII) With Artificial Intelligence (AI)								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS				10	4			615	627		10.1109/TITS.2009.2026673			DEC 2009	2009	This paper presents a framework for real-time highway traffic condition assessment using vehicle kinetic information, which is likely to be made available from vehicle-infrastructure integration (VII) systems, in which vehicle and infrastructure agents communicate to improve mobility and safety. In the proposed VII framework, the vehicle onboard equipment and roadside units (RSUs) collaboratively work, supported by an artificial intelligence (AI) paradigm, to determine the occurrence and characteristics of an incident. Two AI paradigms are examined: 1) support vector machines (SVMs) and 2) artificial neural networks (ANNs). Each RSU then assesses the traffic condition based on the information from multiple vehicles traveling on its supervised highway segment. As a case study, this paper developed a model of the VII-SVM framework and evaluated its performance in a microscopic traffic simulation environment for a highway network in Spartanburg, SC. The performance of the VII-SVM was compared with the performance of the corresponding VII-ANN framework, and both frameworks were found to be capable of classifying the travel experience using the kinetic data generated by each vehicle. The performance of the VII-SVM framework, in terms of its detection rate, false-alarm rate, and detection times, was also found to be superior to a baseline California-type incident-detection algorithm. Moreover, the framework provided additional information, including an estimate of the incident location and the likely number of lanes blocked, which will be helpful for implementing an appropriate response strategy. The proposed VII-AI framework thus provides a reliable alternative to traditional traffic sensors in assessing traffic conditions.									47	0	0	1	0	47			1524-9050	1558-0016		WOS:000272320300008

The natural ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) frequencies for the two samples are about 8.5 and 11.5 GHz. A 50 mA dc produces a FMR frequency reduction of about 1 GHz in both samples. We extracted susceptibility spectra for the samples from the measurement data. We studied inductance variations of Py embedded transmission lines for different dc levels. With 50 mA dc, the operational frequencies of the inductances decreased by 9% and 12.5%. We also tested effects of magnetic fields generated by external magnets on the submicrometer patterns for comparison. To obtain the same magnetization rotation angle, the external magnetic field needs to be about five times larger than the Ampere field created by the direct current. This behavior is unique and may be associated with the increased thermal energy from the Joule heating effects.									12	0	0	0	0	12			0018-9464			WOS:000271951900007		
J	Brooks, Richard R.; Schwier, Jason M.; Griffin, Christopher								Behavior Detection Using Confidence Intervals of Hidden Markov Models								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART B-CYBERNETICS				39	6			1484	1492		10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2019732			DEC 2009	2009	Markov models are commonly used to analyze real-world problems. Their combination of discrete states and stochastic transitions is suited to applications with deterministic and stochastic components. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are a class of Markov models commonly used in pattern recognition. Currently, HMMs recognize patterns using a maximum-likelihood approach. One major drawback with this approach is that data observations are mapped to HMMs without considering the number of data samples available. Another problem is that this approach is only useful for choosing between HMMs. It does not provide a criterion for determining whether or not a given HMM adequately matches the data stream. In this paper, we recognize complex behaviors using HMMs and confidence intervals. The certainty of a data match increases with the number of data samples considered. Receiver operating characteristic curves are used to find the optimal threshold for either accepting or rejecting an HMM description. We present one example using a family of HMMs to show the utility of the proposed approach. A second example using models extracted from a database of consumer purchases provides additional evidence that this approach can perform better than existing techniques.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1083-4419	1941-0492		WOS:000270143800012	19414292

Kaye, Nigel/0000-0001-7190-7791			An experimental study of large area source turbulent plumes								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND FLUID FLOW				30	6			1099	1105		10.1016/j.ijheatfluidflow.2009.05.001			DEC 2009	2009	A series of experiments was performed to measure the rate of entrainment of ambient fluid into a negatively buoyant turbulent plume emerging from a large area source with low initial momentum flux, a so called 'lazy plume'. Immediately below the source, the plume contracts until it reaches a neck of diameter approximately half the source diameter. Beyond the neck it expands, eventually forming a classic pure plume with linear radial growth rate. The variation of volume flow rate, Q with vertical distance from the source, z, was measured in the near source region, between the source and the neck for different source values of Gamma(0), equivalent to the source Richardson number. Experiments were run for 10(5) < Gamma(0) < 5 x 10(7). Our results indicate that the volume flux in the plume increases linearly from the source to the neck, that is, Q proportional to z. This scaling is in contrast to pure plumes where the flow rate increases as Q proportional to z(5/3). Our experimental results collapsed onto a single line when scaled, giving an empirical expression for the near source flow rate of the form Q proportional to Gamma(1/3)(0)z. We discuss this result in relation to the classic entrainment model for turbulent plumes and show that modifications to existing closure schemes are required for lazy plumes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

J	Hales, Douglas N.; Chakravorty, Satya S.; Sridharan, V.								Testing Benford's Law for improving supply chain decision-making: A field experiment								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION ECONOMICS				122	2			606	618		10.1016/j.ijpe.2009.06.017			DEC 2009	2009	Supply chain managers must often trust data reported from suppliers to make decisions about sourcing and product reliability due to the costs or complexity of implementing traditional monitoring systems. Without some form of monitoring, these types of data are vulnerable to manipulation, thus making their suitability for decision-making ambiguous and creating an opportunity for 'supplier opportunism'. Recent practitioner literature suggests one solution to this problem they refer to as 'trust-but-verify'. The purpose of this empirical study is to scientifically examine the feasibility and cost of implementing one 'trust-but-verify' method in a real-world supply chain using a principle called Benford's Law. The results of this two-year study suggest that the technique is feasible and cost effective in identifying supply chain data that have been intentionally manipulated. This finding can allow supply chain managers to segregate suspect data from decision-making until they can be validated and thus mitigate supplier opportunism. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A Test of the Measurement Validity of the Resistance to Change Scale in Russia and Ukraine								JOURNAL OF APPLIED BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE				45	4			468	489		10.1177/0021886309338813			DEC 2009	2009	The authors developed a Russian-language version of Oreg's (2003) Resistance to Change (RTC) Scale, a multidimensional dispositional measure of an individual's tendency to avoid or resist change, and tested its generalizability to the post-Soviet context with data from Russia and Ukraine. Confirmatory factor analysis results indicated a lack of configural consistency for the cognitive rigidity subscale, and post hoc examination suggested an unintended frame of reference for the cognitive rigidity items. The other three subdimensions of the scale-routine seeking, emotional reaction, and short-term thinking-were measurement-invariant in the two countries, providing a psychometrically acceptable measure of individual resistance to change. As a result, this respecification of the RTC Scale should be useful for much needed research devoted to individual resistors to change in the post-Soviet context, an effort essential for understanding obstacles to organizational change, and for generating prescriptive guidelines in a situation where most organizations are pressed by transition-induced need for systemic change and development.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0021-8863			WOS:000280708600001

Strain effect analysis on phonon thermal conductivity of two-dimensional nanocomposites								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS				106	11					114302	10.1063/1.3259383			DEC 1 2009	2009	In this paper, we present a model that combines lattice dynamics and the phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) to analyze strain effect on the cross-plane phonon thermal conductivity of silicon wire-germanium host nanocomposites. For a given strain condition, mechanical strain is translated to crystal lattice deformation by using the Cauchy-Born rule. Strain-dependent phonon thermal properties of Si and Ge obtained from lattice dynamics with Tersoff empirical interatomic potential are then incorporated into the BTE, in which ballistic transport within one material and diffuse scattering between Si-Ge interface are employed. The strain-dependent BTE is solved numerically on an unstructured triangular mesh by using a finite volume method. Nanocomposites with different Si nanowire cross sections are also investigated. The results show that the phonon thermal conductivity of the nanocomposites can be significantly decreased (or increased) by a tensile (or compressive) strain. With the same length change, hydrostatic strain produces a larger variation in phonon thermal conductivity than uniaxial strain. In addition, it is shown that with the same atomic percentage, the cross-sectional shape makes little difference to the thermal conductivity except at very small characteristic lengths of the Si nanowire.									26	0	0	0	0	26			0021-8979			WOS:000272838600116

Sampling Stink Bugs (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) for Population Estimation and Pest Management in Southeastern Cotton Production								JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY				102	6			2360	2370					DEC 2009	2009	Stink bugs (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) were sampled in commercial cotton, Gossypitint hirsutum L., fields in 2007 and 2008 in South Carolina and Georgia. The main species collected with the beat cloth and sweep net methods were green stink bug, Acrostenium hilare (Say) (63 and 57%, respectively); brown stink bug, Euschistus servus (Say) (23 and 18%, respectively); and southern green stink bug, Nezara viridula (L.) (14 and 22%, respectively). Average stink bug densities were 0.145 +/- 0.010 (mean +/- SEM) for adults and 0.250 +/- 0.027 for nymphs per 3.7 m of row by using the beat cloth method. Average stink bug densities were 0.291 +/- 0.016 for all adults and 0.137 +/- 0.018 for all nymphs per 50 sweeps. A density of two southern green stink bugs per 3.7 m of row by using the beat cloth method required 43 samples (reliability or precision, D(x), = 0.3) for population estimation, whereas 88 samples were necessary for a density of two southern green stink bugs per 50 sweeps. At low densities, the sweep net was a more cost-reliable sampling method for all species and life stages. For adult stink bugs, the beat cloth method became more reliable at densities of 1.0, 3.2, and 5.8 stink bugs per 3.7 m of cotton row for southern green stink bug, brown stink bug, and green stink bug, respectively. Sequential sampling consistently reduced sample size for all insects compared with a fixed sampling plan.									16	0	0	16	3	17			0022-0493			WOS:000272492800043	20069868

Improving the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of prolactin, GH, and their antagonists by fusion to a synthetic albumin-binding peptide								JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGY				203	3			375	387		10.1677/JOE-09-0211			DEC 2009	2009	To prolong the circulation half-life of human prolactin (hPRL), human GH (hGH), and their competitive antagonists,, hPRL-G129R, and hGH-G120R, we examined the effects of fusing a serum albumin-binding peptide (SA20) to their amino- or carboxyl-terminus. Fusion of the SA20 peptide to the amino-terminus of the ligands was less detrimental upon their ability to induce or inhibit signal transduction and cell proliferation in vitro than fusion to the carboxyl-terminus. Pharmacokinetic (PK) Studies in mice revealed that the half-life of SA20-hPRL and SA20-hGH was prolonged and their clearance was reduced in comparison with hPRL and hGH. Pharmacodynamic (PD) studies in 8-week-old female mice revealed that lobuloalveolar development in mammary glands was greater in all three groups (daily, every 2 days, or every third day over a 12-day period) of mice treated with SA20-hPRL (4 mg/kg) compared with hPRL (3.59 mg/kg). Similarly, daily administration (i.p.) of SA20-hGH (8 mg/kg) or hGH (7.15 mg/kg) to 23-day-old female mice over a 40-day period revealed the superiority of SA20-hGH over hGH as measured by weight gain, body length, and lobuloalveolar development ill the mammary glands. These findings indicate that SA20 modification of hPRL, hGH, and their respective antagonists improves their PK/PD properties.

New developments include several component models for estimating the lateral ground movement profile, angular distortion and lateral strain in a building, and damage potential of a building adjacent to an excavation. These new developments along with an existing model for the vertical ground movement profile are integrated into the proposed simplified model. Case histories are used to verify the developed simplified model. Furthermore, the uncertainty in the developed model is quantified, which enables a probabilistic assessment of the excavation-induced building damage potential. An example probabilistic assessment of building damage potential is presented.									17	14	0	0	0	29			1090-0241			WOS:000272181800005

Recursive Memory-based Hysteresis Modeling for Solid-state Smart Actuators								JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MATERIAL SYSTEMS AND STRUCTURES				20	18			2161	2171		10.1177/1045389X09348927			DEC 2009	2009	This article presents a new modeling approach for the memory-dependent hysteresis phenomenon in a broad class of smart structures and systems. We propose a recursive formulation to relate the minor hysteresis trajectories to their surrounding loops. More specifically, each internal (minor) trajectory targets its previous turning point and converges to its neighboring loop with a tunable exponential rate. By applying the 'curve alignment' and the 'wiping out' properties at the turning points, we present a new strategy within the context of a memory-based hysteresis modeling framework. A Galfenol-driven micropositioning actuator and a piezoelectrically driven nanopositioning stage are used to experimentally validate the model. Galfenol exhibits large butterfly-type nonlinearity with a small hysteresis effect, while the piezoelectric actuator exhibits wide hysteresis loops. The model is able to precisely predict the major and minor hysteresis loops in both the Galfenol and piezoelectric actuators, and is expected to be effectively and conveniently applicable to general systems exhibiting memory-dependent hysteresis.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1045-389X	1530-8138		WOS:000271683100002

A 0.02 cm(-1) detection limit for these devices is demonstrated. This detection limit represents a threefold improvement as compared to a straight waveguide sensor, while the physical device length is reduced by 40-fold. The reduction in device footprint with enhanced sensitivity makes the structure attractive for "sensor-on-a-chip" device applications. We also present a design optimization approach for cavity-enhanced IR absorption spectroscopy using traveling-wave resonators, which indicates that further performance improvement can be achieved in optimally coupled, low-loss resonant cavities.									25	1	0	1	0	26			0733-8724			WOS:000270724600004

The present model is an extension of our recently developed unit cell-based ballistic material model for the same class of composites (M. Grujicic, G. Arakere, T. He,W.C. Bell, B. A. Cheeseman, C.-F. Yen, and B. Scott, A Ballistic Material Model for Cross-Plied Unidirectional Ultra-High Molecular-Weight Polyethylene Fiber-reinforced Armor-Grade Composites, Mater. Sci. Eng, A 2008, 498(1-2), p 231-241) which was found to be physically sound, but computationally not very efficient. The present model is constructed in such a way that it can be readily integrated into commercial finite element programs like ANSYS/Autodyn (ANSYS/Autodyn version 11.0, User Documentation, Century Dynamics Inc., a subsidiary of ANSYS Inc., 2007), as a User Material Subroutine. To validate the model, a series of transient nonlinear dynamics computational analyses of the transverse impact of armor-grade composite laminates with two types of bullets/projectiles is carried out and the computational results compared with their experimental counterparts. Relatively good agreement is found between the experiment and the computational analysis relative to: (a) the success of the armor panels of different areal densities in defeating the bullets at different initial bullet velocities; (b) postmortem spatial distribution of the damage modes and the extents within the panels; (c) the temporal evolution of the armor-panel back-face bulge; and (d) The existence of three distinct armor-penetration stages (i.e., an initial filament shearing/cutting dominated stage, an intermediate stage characterized by pronounced filament/matrix debonding/decohesion, and a final stage associated with the extensive filaments extension and armor-panel back-face bulging).									34	1	0	0	0	35			1059-9495			WOS:000271750100003

The on-line monitoring for illicit radioactive material with no false positives or false negatives is the goal of homeland security monitoring, but is unrealistic. However, statistical fluctuations in the detector signal, short detection times, large source to detector distances, and shielding effects make distinguishing between a radiation source and natural background particularly difficult. Experimental time series data were collected using a 1aEuro(3) x 1aEuro(3) LaCl(3)(Ce) based scintillation detector (Scionix, Orlando, FL) under various simulated conditions. Experimental parameters include radionuclide (gamma-ray) energy, activity, density thickness (source to detector distance and shielding), time, and temperature. All statistical algorithms were developed using MATLAB (TM). The Shewhart (3-sigma) control chart and the cumulative sum (CUSUM) control chart are the classical procedures adopted, while the Bayesian technique is the Shiryayev-Roberts (S-R) control chart. The Shiryayev-Roberts method was the best method for controlling the number of false positive detects, followed by the CUSUM method. However, The Shiryayev-Roberts method, used without modification, resulted in one of the highest false negative incidence rates independent of the signal strength. Modification of The Shiryayev-Roberts statistical analysis method reduced the number of false negatives, but resulted in an increase in the false positive incidence rate.					8th International Conference on Methods and Applications of Radioanalytical Chemistry8th International Conference on Methods and Applications of Radioanalytical Chemistry	APR 05-10, 2009APR 05-10, 2009	Amer Nucl SocAmer Nucl Soc	Kona, HIKona, HI	6	0	0	2	0	6			0236-5731			WOS:000272303100048		
J	Tayfur, E.; Taaffe, K.								Simulating hospital evacuation-the influence of traffic and evacuation time windows								JOURNAL OF SIMULATION				3	4			220	234		10.1057/jos.2009.16			DEC 2009	2009	Hospital operators typically do not have the luxury of carrying out a sufficient number of full-scale drills to accurately predict performance (eg, evacuation completion time, time required to evacuate a patient, when to start the evacuation, etc) during evacuation. This research presents a stochastic model via simulation to address an advanced-notice evacuation event such as a hurricane. We employ a simulation-optimization approach, comparing the benefits of additional simulation replications or additional simulation test scenarios in providing statistical accuracy in the results. We then identify the staffing and vehicle transport requirements within a pre-specified evacuation time period while minimizing cost. Moreover, we provide these managers with a modelling framework that can indicate if their current resource set is inadequate to evacuate the patient population within the specified time period. Because the operational costs can be highly variable by facility, we present two alternate cost structures in the analysis. Finally, we consider the effect of varying the evacuation start time on overall cost, as well as evacuation completion. By accounting for competing traffic flow from the mass population evacuation, it would be in the best interest of the hospital to begin their evacuation early, however this is often not an option due to the uncertainty in weather predictions several days prior to hurricane landfall.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1747-7778			WOS:000208735600004		
J	Wang, Hui; Wang, Tong; Pometto, Anthony L., III; Johnson, Lawrence A.								A Laboratory Decanting Procedure to Simulate Whole Stillage Separation in Dry-Grind Corn Ethanol Process								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN OIL CHEMISTS SOCIETY				86	12			1241	1250		10.1007/s11746-009-1451-y			DEC 2009	2009	In the dry-grind corn ethanol industry, horizontal decanter centrifuges are used to separate the whole stillage into wet grains and thin stillage. The wet grains mixed with condensed thin stillage are dried to form dried distiller's grains with solubles (DDGS). In order to investigate the effect of different corn breaking treatments on increasing oil partitioning in thin stillage, a laboratory method is needed to simulate industrial decanting where a typical thin stillage is produced. The thin stillage obtained using a conventional laboratory centrifuge had much lower solids content and less than one-half of the dry-matter yield compared to the industry counterpart because the conventional laboratory centrifuge and industry decanter centrifuge have different separation mechanisms. By evaluating the properties of industrial thin stillage and the mechanism of industrial decanter centrifugation, a laboratory decanting device was designed and a decanting procedure, the multiple-wash centrifugal filtration (MWCF) method, was developed. This method involves multiple steps of filtration under centrifugal force after washing the solids with the liquid generated from the same mash. Four cycles of MWCF produced a thin stillage with similar solids content (7.3 vs. 7.2%), dry-matter yield (54.2 vs. 54.7%), and wet yield (83.3 vs. 80.6%) compared to industrial thin stillage. The presence of ethanol did not influence the laboratory decanting results, which indicates the application robustness of this laboratory thin stillage preparation method.									5	0	0	3	0	5			0003-021X			WOS:000271735600013

J	Kothapalli, Chandrasekhar R.; Ramamurthi, Anand								Lysyl oxidase enhances elastin synthesis and matrix formation by vascular smooth muscle cells								JOURNAL OF TISSUE ENGINEERING AND REGENERATIVE MEDICINE				3	8			655	661		10.1002/term.214			DEC 2009	2009	Lysyl oxidase (LOX) is a copper-dependent enzyme that initiates covalent crosslinking of elastin precursors by oxidizing peptidyl lysine to aminoadipic semi-aldehydes. Previous studies have shown LOX deficiency to affect crosslinking of elastin and collagen in vivo, resulting in disorganized connective tissue formation. In this study, we investigated the utility of exogenously supplemented LOX peptides (50-100 mu l/well) to elastin synthesis, crosslinking efficiency and matrix deposition in adult rat aortic smooth muscle cell (RASMC) cultures. Additionally, we also examined the role of LOX peptides on SMC proliferation and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) synthesis in these cultures. Highly purified bovine aorta LOX peptide was found to increase matrix elastin synthesis by 40-80% to that in control cultures in a dose-dependent manner, while the crosslinking efficiency significantly (as measured by the ratio of matrix elastin protein to the total elastin protein synthesized) improved to 45-55% of total elastin synthesized under these conditions. However, LOX peptides affected neither SMC proliferation relative to controls, nor elastin precursor (tropoelastin) synthesis, nor the total elastin synthesis on a per-cell basis. In general, LOX peptides also did not affect MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities relative to control cultures, except for MMP-9 activity suppression at a higher LOX dose, suggesting that these LOX peptide cues could be safely used to enhance tropoelastin crosslinking into matrix structures and elastin matrix yield, within tissue-engineered constructs, a major challenge in the field.

Witnessed Community and Parental Violence in Relation to Substance Use and Delinquency in a National Sample of Adolescents								JOURNAL OF TRAUMATIC STRESS				22	6			525	533		10.1002/jts.20469			DEC 2009	2009	This study examined whether witnessed community and parental violence represented risk factors for substance use and delinquency among adolescents, beyond the contribution of direct violence and other risk factors. We also examined the role of violence characteristics. Participants were a national sample of 3,614 adolescents. Structured telephone interviews assessed demographics, trauma history, witnessed violence, delinquency, and substance use. While accounting for trauma history and other risk factors, witnessed community and parental violence were associated with delinquency. Community violence was associated with substance use, Chronic violence, knowing the perpetrator, and violence outside of school were correlated with substance use and delinqueney among adolescents who witnessed community violence. These findings highlight the importance of targeting witnessed violence in prevention and intervention efforts.									29	0	0	8	0	29			0894-9867			WOS:000273187100006	19885872

Seat-cushion and soft-tissue material modeling and a finite element investigation of the seating comfort for passenger-vehicle occupants								MATERIALS & DESIGN				30	10			4273	4285		10.1016/j.matdes.2009.04.028			DEC 2009	2009	Improved seating comfort is an important factor that most car manufacturers use to distinguish their products from those of their competitors. In today's automotive engineering practice, however, design and development of new, more comfortable car seats is based almost entirely on empiricism, legacy knowledge and extensive, time-consuming and costly prototyping and experimental/field testing. To help accelerate and economize the design/development process of more-comfortable car seats, more extensive use of various computer aided engineering (CAE) tools will be necessary. However, before the CAE tools can be used more successfully by car-seat manufacturers, issues associated with the availability of realistic computer models for the seated human, the seat and the seated-human/seat interactions as well as with the establishment of objective seating-comfort quantifying parameters must be resolved.In the present work detailed finite element models of a prototypical car seat and of a seated human are developed and used in the investigation of seated-human/seat interactions and the resulting seating comfort. To obtain a fairly realistic model for the human, a moderately detailed skeletal model containing 16 bone assemblies and 15 joints has been combined with an equally detailed "skin" model of the human. The intersection between the two models was then used to define the muscular portion of the human. Special attention in the present work has been given to realistically representing/modeling the materials present in different sections of the car seat and the seated human. The models developed in the present work are validated by comparing the computational results related to the pressure distribution over the seated-human/seat interface with their open-literature counterparts obtained in experimental studies involving human subjects.

We present herein a proof-of-concept experiment of a novel particle focusing technique in DC electrokinetic flow through a planar serpentine microchannel. This focusing stems from the cross-stream dielectrophoretic motion induced within the channel turns. The observed particle focusing behavior is consistent with the predicted particle trajectories from a numerical modeling.									60	1	0	29	0	60			1613-4982			WOS:000271550500002		
J	Klein, Richard; Rai, Arun								INTERFIRM STRATEGIC INFORMATION FLOWS IN LOGISTICS SUPPLY CHAIN RELATIONSHIPS								MIS QUARTERLY				33	4			735	762					DEC 2009	2009	This paper focuses on strategic information flows between buyers and suppliers within logistics supply chain relationships and on subsequent relationship-specific performance outcomes. Our analysis of dyadic data collected from 91 buyer-supplier logistics relationships finds that buyer and supplier strategic information flows positively impact the relationship-specific performance of both sharing and receiving parties. Specifically, each party gains financially from improved management of assets, reduced costs of operations, and enhanced productivity. Moreover, each benefits operationally from improved planning, control, and flexibility of resources. Buyer dependence on the supplier increases buyer strategic information flows to the supplier. Additionally, buyer IT customization and both buyer and supplier trusting beliefs in the receiving party positively impact strategic information sharing with partners. This study suggests that partnerships for supply chain services engage in cooperative initiatives to generate relational rents and are an alternative to conventional "arms length" transactional exchanges. These partnerships need to be motivated to go beyond the sharing of order-related information (which must occur in transactional exchanges) and to share strategic information (which has the potential for both additional rent generation and risks of misappropriation).									105	2	0	1	0	107			0276-7783			WOS:000272211500008

Morphological Patterns of Hybridization between Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout and Introduced Rainbow Trout in the South Fork of the Snake River Watershed, Idaho and Wyoming								NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT				29	6			1529	1539		10.1577/M08-128.1			DEC 2009	2009	Hybridization between native and introduced species is considered a serious threat for many native fish populations. In western North America, native cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii subspecies are declining dramatically across their ranges; competition and hybridization with nonnative rainbow trout O. mykiss are recognized as key factors in their decline. Presently, identification of cutthroat trout X rainbow trout hybrids is commonly made using molecular genetic markers because morphological differences are thought to be inaccurate. We sampled trout from the South Fork of the Snake River and 10 tributary streams to test for morphological differences that could predict genetic identity of individual Yellowstone cutthroat trout O. clarkii bouvieri, rainbow trout, and their hybrids. We found distinctive body shape differences among the three groups: Yellowstone cutthroat trout and hybrids had larger heads than rainbow trout. Yellowstone cutthroat trout had shallower bodies and caudal peduncles than rainbow trout, whereas hybrids exhibited intermediate body depth and caudal peduncle depth. Using logistic regression with a suite of morphological measurements, we found an overall rate of 92% for correctly classifying trout as Yellowstone cutthroat trout, hybrids, or rainbow trout. Over 99% of Yellowstone cutthroat trout and 80% of rainbow trout were correctly categorized; however, the correct classification rate for hybridized individuals was considerably lower. This study demonstrates that consistent morphological differences exist between Yellowstone cutthroat trout and rainbow trout in the wild, and the degree of introgression accounts for a significant portion of morphological variation in Yellowstone cutthroat trout X rainbow trout hybrids, thus causing difficulty in the use of morphology alone to classify trout.									4	0	0	4	0	4			0275-5947			WOS:000277113800003

The data recorded produced power spectral density (PSD) profiles which are currently used in laboratory settings to drive vibration tables in order to simulate a particular vehicle type. Overall Grms values were averaged and compared to previous research studies.The data collected from this research study could be utilized for packaging research when developing products and packages that will pass through a distribution cycle which includes transportation via a feeder aircraft. One example of this type of distribution cycle is the small parcel shipping environment. The PSD profiles which were analyzed from this research could simulate in-flight aircraft vibration of the aircraft chassis in a laboratory environment. This will enable further research in the air transport environment. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0894-3214			WOS:000273184300006

Early and late onset sepsis results in significant mortality in extremely preterm infants, but little is known about sepsis outcomes in late preterm infants.Methods: This is an observational cohort study of infants <121 days of age (119,130 infants less than or equal to 3 days of life and 106,142 infants between 4 and 120 days of life) with estimated gestational age at birth between 34 and 36 weeks, admitted to 248 neonatal intensive care units in the United States between 1996 and 2007.Results: During the study period, the cumulative incidence of early and late onset sepsis was 4.42 and 6.30 episodes per 1000 admissions, respectively. Gram-positive organisms caused the majority of early and late onset sepsis episodes. Infants with early onset sepsis caused by Gram-negative rods and infants with late onset sepsis were more likely to die than their peers with sterile blood cultures (odds ratio [OR]: 4.39, 95% Cl: 1.71-11.23, P = 0.002; and OR: 3.37, 95% CI: 2.35-4.84, P < 0.001, respectively).Conclusion: Late preterm infants demonstrate specific infection rates, pathogen distribution, and mortality associated with early and late onset sepsis. The results of this study are generalizable to late preterm infants admitted to the special care nursery or neonatal intensive care unit.									83	3	0	46	5	91			0891-3668			WOS:000272225200003	19953725

Drawing upon psychological theories involving self-concept and motivation, we investigated both the main and interactive effects of CSE and cognitive ability when predicting an objective outcome. Specifically, results indicated that high CSE strengthened the positive relation between cognitive ability and academic achievement. Study contributions and limitations are discussed.

In this work we analyze the changes in the Raman spectra of SWNT samples substitutionaly doped with boron, nitrogen, and phosphorous. We find that small amounts of dopants are not enough to change the frequency of the tangential G mode, but there is a doping-dependent shift in omega(G) when the P-doped SWNTs are measured at high laser power, indicating that doping can change the thermal properties of SWNT bundles. This result seems to hold also for B-doped samples, but not for N-doped SWNTs, showing a different behavior for donors (P- and N- doping). The I(D)/I(G) ratio analysis to provide information about the doping level in the SWNT samples is also discussed. (C) 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Lameness score, muscle atrophy, osteoarthritis (OA) score, and range of motion (ROM) were evaluated preoperatively, and at 6 weeks and 7-10 months postoperatively.ResultsOperative time was 75 +/- 16 minutes. Fifty-six percent required > 1 bone tunnel attempts. One dog required revision at 2 weeks because of suture loosening. All stifles were stable at 6 weeks postoperatively. Fifteen animals were available for follow-up (7-10 months). Lameness improved significantly at 6 weeks (P <.0001), whereas muscle atrophy was worse at 6 weeks (P=.008) but improved at 7-10 months (P <.0001). OA scores were unchanged at 6 weeks (P=.08) but were significantly worse at 7-10 months (P <.0001). ROM remained unchanged at 6 weeks (P=1) and 7-10 months (P=.6).ConclusionsThe medially placed toggle provides a reliable short-term proximal anchor for the extracapsular suture with outcomes similar to other extracapsular techniques. The aiming device and drill bit are not recommended in their current form.Clinical RelevanceThe TCTS appears to be a well-tolerated technique for proximal suture anchoring in extracapsular CrCL repair in small dogs and cats where instrumentation and anatomic constraints preclude other techniques.									13	0	0	6	0	13			0161-3499			WOS:000272590600011	20017856

Some scholars have proposed that elements of African American social experience may contribute to the maintenance of these positive self-views. The article evaluates these arguments using data drawn from a panel study of socioeconomically diverse African American adolescent girls living in Iowa and Georgia. The article analyzes the relationship between body size and social self-image over three waves of data, starting when the girls were 10 years of age and concluding when they were approximately 14. The findings show that heavier respondents hold less positive social self-images; however, the findings also show that being raised in a family that practices racial socialization moderates this relationship.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0044-118X			WOS:000271482700005	20161575

We demonstrate that these nanoscale surface films exhibit a self-selecting or "equilibrium" thickness, akin to those observed in simpler binary oxides [Luo and Chiang, Annu. Rev. Mater. Res. 38, 227 (2008)]. These observations can be interpreted as a case of coupled prewetting and premelting. Similar nanoscale intergranular films are also observed.

ACT formative process data were examined at the end of each year to provide timely, corrective feedback to keep the intervention "on track".Results: Between years 1 and 2 and years 2 and 3, three significant changes were made to attempt to increase dose and fidelity rates in the program delivery and participant attendance (reach). These changes included expanding the staff training, reformatting the intervention manual, and developing a tracking system for contacting parents of students who were not attending the after-school programs regularly. Process outcomes suggest that these efforts resulted in notable improvements in attendance, dose, and fidelity of intervention implementation from years 1 to 2 and 2 to 3 of the ACT trial.Conclusion: Process evaluation methods, particularly implementation monitoring, are useful tools to ensure fidelity in intervention trials and for identifying key best practices for intervention delivery.									29	0	0	6	0	29			1479-5868			WOS:000272818400001	19948049

While multiple laboratory studies have shown the effects of such compounds on an individual basis at elevated concentrations, little research has attempted to characterize the effects of exposure to environmentally relevant mixtures of estrogenic compounds. The current study examined the effects of long-term exposure to graded concentrations (0, 50, 100%) of wastewater effluent on the fathead minnow, Pimephales promelas. The F1 generation was cultured in control water to test for transgenerational effects from parental exposure to wastewater effluent. Total estrogenic activity in the wastewater was determined to be approximately 1.7 ng/L 17 beta-estradiol equivalents. Survival, growth, and reproduction in the parent generation were not affected by exposure to the wastewater treatments. An increase in the gonadosomatic index and a reduction in the expression of secondary sex characteristics in male fathead minnows exposed to 100% wastewater in the parent generation were observed. Conversely, the expression of secondary sex characteristics was greater in males from the F1 generation of wastewater-exposed parents. Additionally, a positive relationship between parental exposure to wastewater and the onset of reproductive activity in the F1 generation was observed. Results of this study suggest that exposure to wastewater effluent did not pose a significant threat to the successful growth, development, and reproduction of the fathead minnow. Early onset of reproductive activity observed in the F1 generation of wastewater-exposed parents in subsequent generations should be studied further. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Genome characterization showed that the virus isolated from horses (with neurological disorders, 78% fatality) belongs to a new species the Peruvian horse sickness virus (PHSV), within the genus Orbivirus, family Reoviridae. This represents the first isolation of PHSV, which was subsequently also isolated during 1999, from diseased horses in the Northern Territory of Australia (Elsey virus, ELSV). Serological and molecular studies showed that PHSV and ELSV are very similar in the serotype-determining protein (99%, same serotype). The second virus (Rioja virus, RIOV) was associated with neurological signs in donkeys, cattle, sheep and dogs and was shown to be a member of the species Yunnan orbivirus (YUOV). RIOV and YUOV are also almost identical (97% amino acid identity) in the serotype-determining protein. YUOV was originally isolated from mosquitoes in China. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) was used to polymerize VDMA in benzene at 65 degrees C using either 2-(2-cyanopropyl) dithiobenzoate (CPDB) or 2-dodecylsulfanylthiocarbotlylsulfanyl-2-methylpropionic acid (DMP) as RAFT chain transfer agents (CTAs). The pseudo-first-order kinetics and resultant well-defined polymers of low polydispersity indicate that both CTAs afford control over the RAFT polymerization of VDMA. Dynamic and static light scattering and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) were performed to determine the weight-average molecular weight, radius of gyration, and second virial coefficient of VDMA homopolymers in THF. Additionally, well-defined polymers of VDMA containing carboxyl end groups were covalently attached to epoxy-modified silicon wafers via esterification to produce polymeric scaffolds that can be subsequently functionalized for various bio-inspired applications.									31	1	0	3	0	32			0024-9297	1520-5835		WOS:000271756500060

Nanoparticle Electroluminescence: Controlling Emission Color Through Forster Resonance Energy Transfer in Hybrid Particles								ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS				19	22			3604	3609		10.1002/adfm.200900473			NOV 23 2009	2009	Electroluminescent (EL) polymers are attractive for developing all-organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) due to the potential advantages that polymeric systems may offer in the large-scale manufacturing of electronics. Nonetheless, many of these EL pi-conjugated polymers are inherently insoluble in the solvents employed in the intended solution-basd manufacturing processes. One such polymer is poly(2,5-dioctyl-1,4- phenylenevinylene) (POPPV), where the inherent lack of solubility of POPPV in organic solvents has frustrated its widespread application in devices and no OLEDs have been presented that exploit its electroluminescence characteristics. In this effort, a unique strategy is presented for the preparation of hybrid nanoparticles composed of POPPV, a green emitter (lambda(em) = 505 nm) and poly(9,9-di-n-octylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl) (PFO), a blue emitter (lambda(em)= 417 nm). The aqueous-based nanoparticle dispersion composed of these hybrid particles is stable to aggregate and can be employed in the construction of OLEDs. The color characteristics of the electroluminescence for the devices can be tuned by exploiting the Forster resonance energy transfer between the polymers within a particle, while suppressing energy transfer between the particles. These aqueous-based nanoparticle dispersions are amenable to being printed into devices through high-throughput manufacturing techniques, for example, roll-to-roll printing.									21	0	0	0	0	21			1616-301X			WOS:000272503500011

Blindfolded subjects (n = 14) estimated their subjective vertical in conditions of deviation of the centre of mass (CM) of (1) the head-trunk unit or (2) the head segment alone Verticality estimates (provided in a haptic modality) were significantly altered by the deviation of the head-trunk CM (by either 4 degrees or 7 degrees), indicating that the subjects used mass-based proprioceptive information stemming from the trunk. Modifying the perception of body orientation by shifting the trunk CM sideways while keeping the body vertical, deviates the subjective vertical towards the opposite side in a similar way to the so-called 'E-effect'. The induced deviations of head CM (9.33 degrees) did not affect the subjective vertical. suggesting that when the balance of the body is not threatened, proprioceptive or vestibular information is prioritized to estimate gravitational direction (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The effects of different solvents, solvent concentration and solid to liquid ratio on corilagin contents were individually determined. The optimum conditions of high pressure extraction (HPE) for corilagin content were carried out also at various pressures (200-500 MPa), time (2.5-30 min) and temperatures (30-90 degrees C). The content of corilagin obtained by HPE (9.65 mg/g dry matter) was higher than the ultrasonic (7.91 mg/g dry matter) or conventional (2.35 mg/g dry matter) extraction. Thus, application of HPE obtained higher corilagin content and required less extraction time compared to other extraction methods. The pharmaceutical and food industry can be benefited by the usage of high pressure extraction technology. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the effects of the addition of La, V, and/or Fe promoters on the kinetics of the formation of various products were determined and the mechanistic pathways were delineated using a Langmuir-Hinshelwood approach. Non-promoted and promoted Rh supported on SiO2 were prepared using the incipient wetness impregnation method and were reduced in H-2 at 500 degrees C before reaction. The kinetic study was carried out using a fixed-bed differential reactor. It was found that, in general, increasing H-2 pressure resulted in increased activities, while increasing CO partial pressure had an opposite effect. However, the specific influence of H-2 or CO partial pressure on the activity and selectivities differed greatly with different promoters. There was a more significant change in the activity of the La-V doubly promoted Rh catalyst with H-2 or CO partial pressure than for other catalysts, which may be due to a synergistic effect between La and V. The Fe singly promoted catalyst showed different trends in both rate and selectivity from other catalysts, suggesting a different promoting mechanism than La or V. Based on the fact that hydrogen-assisted CO dissociation has been reported to best describe the mechanism for Rh catalysts, Langmuir-Hinshelwood rate expressions for the formation of methane and of ethanol were derived and compared to the experimentally derived power-law parameters. It was found that the addition of different promoters appeared to result in different rate-limiting steps. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Biomineralization is mediated by a mantle epithelium that appears to be involved in calcium uptake and the secretion of calcium laden matrix. Larval and adult intertidal Balanomorph barnacles tolerate a wide range of salinities and it is hypothesized that active ion transport is the primary mechanism for osmoregulation. We observed adult Amphibalanus amphitrite producing an electrolyte-rich secretion emanating from the junction of the basis and parietal plates. Further study of this region using silver staining microscopic techniques, verified by scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive spectroscopy, revealed a chloride ion rich mantle epithelium. A distinctive pattern of silver chloride stained epithelia was revealed in all A. amphitrite life stages. These epithelia were observed to contain mitochondria rich cells in nauplius and cyprid larvae (as shown by DASPMI staining visualized with confocal laser scanning microscopy) and therefore exhibit potential for active ion transport. Rhod-5 N (a low affinity cellular Ca(2+) indicator) labeling was also observed in all barnacle life stages, in tissues shown to be chloride positive. We suspect that the observed chloride ion rich epithelia facilitate ionic regulation via active transport, and biomineralization via cellular Ca(2+) uptake, storage and mobilization.

X-ray crystal structures have been determined for multiple members of this family and, together with biochemical studies, provide insights into the active site and catalytic mechanisms used by these enzymes. These studies have shown that the enzymes use a domain rotation of 140 degrees to reconfigure a single active site to catalyze the two partial reactions. We present here the crystal structure of a new medium chain acyl-CoA synthetase from Methanosarcina acetivorans. The binding pocket for the three substrates is analyzed, with many conserved residues present in the AMP binding pocket. The CoA binding pocket is compared to the pockets of both acetyl-CoA synthetase and 4-chlorobenzoate:-CoA ligase. Most interestingly, the acyl-binding pocket of the new structure is compared with other acyl- and aryl-CoA synthetases. A comparison of the acyl-binding pocket of the acyl-CoA synthetase from M. acetivorans with other structures identifies a shallow pocket that is used to bind the medium chain carboxylates. These insights emphasize the high sequence and structural diversity among this family in the area of the acyl-binding pocket. Proteins 2009; 77:685-698.

Coupled vibration and parameter sensitivity analysis of rocking-mass vibrating gyroscopes								JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION				327	3-5			564	583		10.1016/j.jsv.2009.06.021			NOV 13 2009	2009	Vibrating beam gyroscopes are widely used to measure the angle or the rate of rotation of many mechanical systems. The vibration and parameters sensitivity analyses of a specific type of vibrating beam gyroscope namely rocking-mass gyroscopes are presented in this paper. These types of gyroscopes by far have a better performance than the conventional single-beam gyroscopes. The system comprises of four slender beams attached to a rigid substrate, undergoing coupled flexural and torsional vibrations with a finite mass attached in the middle. Two of the beams carry piezoelectric patch actuators on top, while the other two possess piezoelectric patch sensors. Using extended Hamilton's principle, the resulting eight coupled partial differential equations of motion with their corresponding boundary conditions are derived. In spite of the need for a high computational power, the system is analysed in the frequency domain using an exact method and the closed-form characteristic equations for two cases of fixed and rotating base support are obtained. Furthermore, a detailed parameter sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine the effects of different parameters on the complex natural frequencies of the system. Results presented are valuable in the design of this type of gyroscope as the exact resonant conditions and the sensitivity of the system parameters play important roles in the dynamic performance of gyroscopes.

We have used calculations to design three nonfluorous compounds meant to model the monomeric repeat units of polymers that exhibit multiple favorable binding sites for CO2. These compounds are methoxy isopropyl acetate, 2-methoxy ethoxy-propane, and 2-methoxy methoxy-propane. We have synthesized oligomers or polymers based on these small compounds and have tested their solubility in CO,). All three of these exhibit appreciable solubility ill CO2. At 25 degrees C, oligo(3-acetoxy oxetane)6 is 5 wt % soluble at 25 MPa, the random copolymer (vinyl methoxymethyl ether(30)-co-vinyl acetate(9)) is 5 wt % soluble at 70 MPa and random copolymer (vinyl 1-methoxyethyl ether(30)-co-vinyl acetate(9)) is 3 wt % soluble at 120 MPa. These oligomers and polymers represent new additions to the very short list of nonfluorous CO2-soluble polymers. However, none of these are more soluble than poly(vinyl acetate), which exhibits the highest CO2 solubility of any known polymer containing only the elements C, H, and O.									28	2	0	0	0	30			1520-6106			WOS:000271428200018	19845375

This paper provides the first estimate of the rate of marital disruption in the U. S. in 1860 - 1948. In the long run, the cohort rate of marital disruption increased from about 10% in the mid-1860s to about 30% in the 1940s. Marital disruption rate was similar to the divorce rate after the Civil War but the two rates diverged wildly in the early 20(th) century. In 1900 - 1930, the disruption rate was as much as double the divorce rate, implying that perhaps half of all disruptions never reached the court.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1435-9871			WOS:000271617100001

Reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide, have been shown to be potent mediators of this inflammation.Methods: Mucosal biopsy specimens were collected from patients undergoing sinonasal surgery and were used as a source of primary epithelial cells. Human sinonasal epithelial (HSNE) cells and were isolated from sinus tissue, maintained in culture, and ultimately treated with varying concentrations of CSE with or without free superoxide dismutase (SOD). Supernatants and cell lysates were examined for the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-8. Similar experiments were performed using normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cell lines.Results: CSE induces both secretion and intracellular production of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-8 by HSNE cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, this up-regulation can be suppressed by SOD. CSE induces secretion of IL-8 in NHBEs that is also suppressed by SOD.Conclusion: Inflammation in the airway after CSE can be blocked by SOD in this in vitro model. The ability to attenuate CSE-induced inflammation with SOD could provide a therapeutic/preventative approach for individuals with cigarette smoke exposure.

The basis for the relationship between pediatric asthma and obesity is not well established.Objectives: To explore the association between obesity and asthma severity in children and adolescents and to test whether obesity-induced inflammation, as characterized by serum C-reactive protein (CRP), is associated with increased severity of asthma.Methods: Retrospective cohort analysis of interview, physical examination, and laboratory test data from participants younger than 20 years in 2 rounds of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2001-2002 and 2003-2004). We also performed generalized ordered logistic regression to evaluate the effect of body mass index (BMI) z score and CRP level on asthma severity, controlling for the impact of age, sex, race, income, insurance, and tobacco smoke exposure.Results: Of the 77 million individuals younger than 20 years represented by this weighted sample, 19% met the study-defined criteria for asthma; most cases were defined as mild (11%) or moderate (6%); 2% had severe asthma. In multivariable models, elevated BMI z scores (odds ratio, 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.21) were associated with worse asthma severity. Elevated CRP level was associated with obesity (P<.001) and asthma severity (odds ratio, 1.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-1.52).Conclusions: Higher BMI z scores and elevated serum CRP levels are associated with increased asthma severity. These findings highlight the importance of controlling for inflammation when considering the role of obesity and provide support for the hypothesis that obesity-induced inflammation may contribute to greater asthma severity.

We investigate two cases which are different in the way that servers work together when at the same station; namely collaboratively or non-collaboratively. For the collaborative case we prove the optimal policy to be such that the servers work together at a single station at any point in time. In addition to the policy being state-dependent, it also follows a switching-curve structure. In the non-collaborative case, on the other hand, it may be optimal to allocate servers to different stations. Some numerical examples and results regarding policy assignments, switching Curves, and system throughput are presented.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0254-5330			WOS:000273720500001

We show that even in the two-station two-server case the optimal policy follows a complex state-dependent structure that may be difficult to implement in practice. We propose three alternate heuristic policies and assess their performance. We show that a simpler policy which only moves one server can achieve close to optimal results.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0254-5330			WOS:000273720500014

The goals of this Study were to examine ways of measuring PC in heart rate variability (HRV) data and the relationship between PC and team performance. Teams were tasked with entering both real and simulated rooms and "shooting" individuals with a weapon and identifying individuals without a weapon. The linear correlation and directional agreement PC methods were shown to be the most sensitive to differences in performance, with greater PC being associated with better performance. The correlation method when applied to a measure of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) revealed a significant difference between high and low performers (t[8] = -2.31, p = 0.03) and the directional agreement applied to inter-beat-intervals and RSA revealed trend-level differences (t[4.62] = -1.86, p = 0.06 and t[8] = -1.68, p = 0.07). These results suggest that PC may have merit for predicting team performance. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Physical considerations based on the collision kinetic energy and the surface energies of the colliding drops lead to the development of a theoretical regime diagram for the drop/raindrop collision outcomes in the We-p plane (We - Weber number, p - raindrop diameter ratio). This theoretical regime diagram is supported by laboratory experimental observations of drop collisions using high-speed imaging. Results of this fundamental study bring in new insights into the quantitative understanding of drop dynamics, applications of which extend beyond precipitation microphysics. In particular, results of this drop collision study are expected to give impetus to the physics-based dynamic modeling of the drop size distributions that is essential for various typical modern engineering applications, including numerical modeling of evolution of raindrop size distribution in rain shaft.

As biological approaches alone, such as VEGF, have fallen short of their promises, one may look for an engineering approach to build microvasculature. Layer-by-layer approaches for customized fabrication of cell/scaffold constructs have shown some potential in building complex 3D structures. With the advent of cell printing, one may be able to build precise human microvasculature with suitable bio-ink. Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) and fibrin were studied as bio-ink for microvasculature construction. Endothelial cells are the only cells to compose the human capillaries and also form the entire inner lining of cardiovascular system. Fibrin has been already widely recognized as tissue engineering scaffold for vasculature and other cells, including skeleton/smooth muscle cells and chondrocytes. In our study, we precisely fabricated micron-sized fibrin channels using a drop-on-demand polymerization. This printing technique uses aqueous processes that have been shown to induce little, if any, damage to cells. When printing HMVEC cells in conjunction with the fibrin, we found the cells aligned themselves inside the channels and proliferated to form confluent linings. The 3D tubular structure was also found in the printed patterns. We conclude that a combined simultaneous cell and scaffold printing can promote HMVEC proliferation and microvasculature formation.

Enhanced solid-liquid separation of dairy manure with natural flocculants								BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY				100	22			5417	5423		10.1016/j.biortech.2008.11.012			NOV 2009	2009	The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of natural flocculants to reduce solids and nutrient loads in dairy cow wastewater using solid-liquid separation: chitosan was used as a model. Its use efficiency and optimum application rate were determined using flushed dairy cow manure of varied strengths - 0.4%, 0.8%, 1.6%. and 3.2% total solids (TS) content. Treatments consisted of nine rates of chitosan. The flocculated manure was dewatered using 1-mm and 0.25-mm screens. Separation by screening alone was not effective: average efficiencies were about 60% for total suspended solids (TSS), 22% for total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), and 26% for total phosphorus (TP). Mixing with chitosan before screening substantially increased separation. At optimum chitosan rate (0.5 g/L for the highest strength effluent), separation efficiencies were >95% for TSS, >73% for TKN, and >54% for TP. The results of this study indicate that natural flocculants such as chitosan are useful for the solid-liquid separation treatment of livestock wastewater. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

However, risk managers typically have not been able to quantify how resource availability, the cost of acquiring those resources. and evacuation completion time are related. This paper proposes a deterministic optimization approach for identifying the staffing and vehicle transport requirements, as well as the scheduling of these requirements, within a pre-specified evacuation time period while minimizing cost. Moreover, we provide these managers with a modeling framework that can indicate if their current resource set is inadequate to evacuate the patient population within the specified time period. We suggest a tailored solution approach that relaxes certain complicating integer constraints in an effort to find feasible, quality solutions. Using this optimization-based heuristic, we then evaluate the hospital evacuation problem, providing insights into the period-by-period requirements of nurses and vehicles, as well as how resource restrictions would affect the evacuation. Finally, we provide a comparison of minimizing cost against minimizing evacuation completion time, where we have a budget restriction in the latter case. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This article examines how cost and quality priorities-two key attributes of manufacturing strategy-influence a manufacturer's propensity to outsource. By doing so, we bridge the existing gap between research on manufacturing strategy and firm boundaries. We develop a theory-based model that links a manufacturer's cost and quality priorities to its plans to outsource production. Our empirical analyses, based on survey data obtained from 867 manufacturing business units, control for firm-specific factors previously shown to impact outsourcing, including asset specificity, uncertainty, and current capabilities in cost and quality. We found that the competitive priority placed on cost played an integral role in sourcing decisions, while, surprisingly, conformance quality priorities did not. The cost result is consistent with our expectations and observations in practice. The significant effect of cost priority on outsourcing shows that any theory of firm boundaries that fails to consider competitive priorities is incomplete. The finding regarding quality, which was counter to our expectations, may partially explain why there is an emergence of so many nonconforming products associated with outsourcing. Taken together, our results provide theoretical insights for future research into how manufacturing managers can improve their decision making on outsourcing production.									11	0	0	0	0	11			0011-7315			WOS:000272188600003

A common failure in these constructions during high wind events is loss of roof sheathing, especially in corner areas. Less common perhaps, but usually catastrophic, is the failure of the roof-to-wall connections in these structures. The main objective of the current research project is to evaluate the in-situ capacity of roof-to-wall connections and sheathing to rafter fasteners in light-framed wood constructions. The unique opportunity provided by Clemson University to access four residential structures located within a residential complex enabled the collection of perishable yet statistically significant data on the strengths of existing residential structures. The uplift capacities of 100 roof-to-wall toenail connections and 34 plank sheathing units were evaluated from field and laboratory tests. Realizing the key role of probability distributions in developing fragility estimates and loss prediction models, distribution fits and parameters for these structural components are postulated. One conclusion drawn is that the uplift capacities of two and three nail connections are best described by a lognormal distribution. The initial stiffness and the vertical displacement at peak load of both two nail and three nail connections follow a normal and Weibull distribution respectively. The uplift capacity of plank sheathing follows a lognormal distribution. An analytical model designed to approximate the uplift behavior of toenail connections is developed to facilitate modeling of roof systems. These probabilistic and analytical models developed by this study allow for the performance of detailed reliability based studies on light-framed wood roof structures. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

For example, procyclic form (PF) trypanosomes monitor changes in glucose levels to regulate surface molecule expression, which is important for survival in the tsetse fly vector. The molecular connection between glycolysis and surface molecule expression is unknown. Here we partially characterize T. brucei homologs of the beta and gamma subunits of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and determine their roles in regulating surface molecule expression. Using flow cytometry and mass spectrometry, we found that TbAMPK beta or TbAMPK gamma-deficient parasites express both of the major surface molecules, EP- and GPEET-procyclin, with the latter being a form that is expressed when glucose is low such as in the tsetse fly. Last, we have found that the putative scaffold component of the complex, TbAMPK beta, fractionates with organellar components and colocalizes in part with a glycosomal marker as well as the flagellum of PF parasites.

Recently, Chen et al. (Acta Math Sci Ser A Chin Ed 27(1):166-170, 2007) proved that a cubic graph has paired-domination number at most three-fifths the number of vertices in the graph.

Two types of solid-ore ARROW fibers were considered and signal demodulation was achieved by using the white light interferometric technique. The ARROW fibers have two rings of high index rods arranged in a hexagonal structure with a lattice constant of 6 m. The different sizes of the rods cause different measurand sensitivities for the two fibers. Resolutions of +/- 1.1 mu epsilon and +/- 0.07 degrees C were achieved for strain and temperature, respectively.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1041-1135			WOS:000270947000001

Grammar Recovery from Parse Trees and Metrics-Guided Grammar Refactoring								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING				35	6			780	794		10.1109/TSE.2009.65			NOV-DEC 2009	2009	Many software development tools that assist with tasks such as testing and maintenance are specific to a particular development language and require a parser for that language. Because a grammar is required to develop a parser, construction of these software development tools is dependent upon the availability of a grammar for the development language. However, a grammar is not always available for a language and, in these cases, acquiring a grammar is the most difficult, costly, and time-consuming phase of tool construction. In this paper, we describe a methodology for grammar recovery from a hard-coded parser. Our methodology is comprised of manual instrumentation of the parser, a technique for automatic grammar recovery from parse trees, and a semiautomatic metrics-guided approach to refactoring an iterative grammar to obtain a recursive grammar. We present the results of a case study in which we recover and refactor a grammar from version 4.0.0 of the GNU C++ parser and then refactor the recovered grammar using our metrics-guided approach. Additionally, we present an evaluation of the recovered and refactored grammar by comparing it to the ISO C++98 grammar.									6	1	0	0	0	7			0098-5589	1939-3520		WOS:000272172800004

This paper differs in that the process mean and variance are considered to be a biobjective problem since the primary goal of robust design is to determine the optimal robust design factor settings by minimizing performance variability and deviation from a target value of a product. A more comprehensive set of solutions is developed using a lexicographic weighted Tchebycheff approach to the biobjective robust design model rather than the approaches traditionally used in the dual-response approach to obtain efficient solutions. Numerical examples show that the proposed model is far more effective than the traditional weighted sum approach.									20	0	0	4	0	20			0740-817X			WOS:000270267500003

Axis Ratios of Water Drops Levitated in a Vertical Wind Tunnel								JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY				26	11			2413	2419		10.1175/2009JTECHA1275.1			NOV 2009	2009	The shapes of falling raindrops are often significantly altered by drop oscillations, complicating dual-polarization radar methods that rely on a predictable, monotonic variation of drop axis ratio alpha with equivolume drop diameter d. This oscillation behavior varies with d so that time-averaged shapes, which are determined by oscillation mode, sometimes deviate from the d-dependent quiescent shape. The literature identifies a predominance of particular oscillation modes at discrete d, as well as the onset of oscillations at d approximate to 1 mm; however, the specific mechanisms of this phenomenon are unknown. In the present work, measurements of drop axis ratio alpha were obtained from observations of drops levitated in a vertical wind tunnel. Discordance of the present data with the literature suggests a correlation between oscillation mode and fall trajectory, as well as a steady-state mechanism for the excitation of specific modes for d = 1.3-3-mm drops.									5	1	0	0	0	6			0739-0572			WOS:000271904500011

Estimates of the child health input demand functions and the child health production functions from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey accord with the prediction that optimizing behavior results in higher levels of aggregate child health. Observable parental behaviors respond to the physical developmental status of their children. These parental responses appear to yield large and statistically significant improvements in children's early physiological outcomes. However, because some health inputs choices are not observable, it is impossible to ascertain whether these measured effects are due solely to variations in the observed input choices.

The objective of this study is to propose a practical framework for simultaneous estimation of the local stiffness and piezoelectric properties of materials. For this, the governing equation of motion of a vertical PFM is derived at a given point on the sample. Using the expansion theorem, the governing ordinary differential equations of the system and their state-space representation are derived under applied external voltage. For the proof of the concept, the results obtained from both frequency and step responses of a PFM experiment are utilized to simultaneously identify the microcantilever parameters along with local spring constant and piezoelectric coefficient of a periodically poled lithium niobate sample. In this regard, a new parameter estimation strategy is developed for modal identification of system parameters under general frequency response. Results indicate good agreements between the identified model and the experimental data using the proposed modeling and identification framework. This method can be particularly applied for accurate characterization of mechanical and piezoelectric properties of biological species and cells.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0022-0434			WOS:000271646800014

Plastic composite support tubes, composed of 50% (w/w) polypropylene and 50% (w/w) agricultural products were used as support media. The effects of operating pH (3.5, 4.0, and 4.5) and hydraulic retention times (HRTs) (5.0, 3.75, 2.5, and 1.25 h) on fungal growth, chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal and unwanted bacterial growth were evaluated under nonaseptic conditions. COD removal and biomass production were highest at pH 4.0 with lowest bacterial competition. Maximum COD removal of up to 80% was achieved at a 5.0 h HRT with a biomass yield of 0.44 g volatile suspended solids per g COD removed. A higher biomass yield was achieved at a shorter HRT of 2.5 h due to increased substrate availability; however, the biofilm was more sensitive to changes in wastewater composition. A HRT of 3.5-4 h was considered optimal in achieving organic removal and fungal biomass production. Significant loss of fungal biomass due to washout occurred at a 1.5 h HRT. Undesirable bacterial populations as a fraction of total biomass decreased with reducing HRT, excluding the 1.25 h HRT. Reductions in COD removal and biomass production were observed with decreases in aeration rate (1.0-0.25 L/min or 0.8-0.2 vvm (air volume per reactor working volume per minute). The recovered fungal biomass was found to contain protein of up to 40% (dry mass basis), which could serve as a source of high-value animal feed.									4	1	0	1	0	5			0733-9372	1943-7870		WOS:000270913300004

Microalgal biomass production and utilization offers potential for greenhouse gas (GHG) avoidance by providing biofuel replacement of fossil fuels and carbon-neutral animal feeds. This paper presents an initial analysis of the potential for GHG avoidance using a proposed algal biomass production system coupled to recovery of flue-gas CO2 combined with waste sludge and/or animal manure utilization. A model is constructed around a 50-MW natural gas-fired electrical generation plant operating at 50% capacity as a semibase-load facility. This facility is projected to produce 216 million k.Wh/240-day season while releasing 30.3 million kg-C/season of GHG-CO2. An algal system designed to capture 70% of flue-gas CO2 would produce 42,400 t (dry wt) of algal biomass/season and requires 880 ha of high-rate algal ponds operating at a productivity of 20 g-dry-wt/m(2)-day. This algal biomass is assumed to be fractionated into 20% extractable algal oil, useful for biodiesel, with the 50% protein content providing animal feed replacement and 30% residual algal biomass digested to produce methane gas, providing gross GHG avoidances of 20, 8.5, and 7.8%, respectively. The total gross GHG avoidance potential of 36.3% results in a net GHG avoidance of 26.3% after accounting for 10% parasitic energy costs. Parasitic energy is required to deliver CO2 to the algal culture and to harvest and process algal biomass and algal products. At CO2 utilization efficiencies predicted to range from 60-80%, net GHG avoidances are estimated to range from 22-30%. To provide nutrients for algal growth and to ensure optimal algae digestion, importation of 53 t/day of waste paper, municipal sludge, or animal manure would be required. This analysis does not address the economics of the processes considered. Rather, the focus is directed at determination of the technical feasibility of applying integrated algal processes for fossil-fuel replacement and power-plant GHG avoidance. The technology discussed remains in early stages of development, with many important technical issues yet to be addressed. Although theoretically promising, successful integration of waste treatment processes with algal recovery of flue-gas CO2 will require pilot-scale trials and field demonstrations to more precisely define the many detailed design requirements.									88	1	0	53	0	90			0733-9372	1943-7870		WOS:000270913300007

Fresh litter and decomposed duff materials for the four dominant vegetation components of California oak woodlands: blue oak (Quercus douglassi H. & A.), live oak (Quercus wislizenii A. DC.), foothill pine (Pinus sabiniana Dougl.), and annual grasses, were exposed in natural condition for an entire rainy season (December to May) to evaluate their contributions of particulate (POC) and dissolved (DOC) organic carbon, particulate (PON) and dissolved (DON) organic nitrogen, inorganic nitrogen (NH(4)(+) and NO(3)(-)), and trihalomethane (THM) and haloacetonitrile (HAN) formation potentials, to surface waters. Litter and duff materials can be significant sources of DOC (litter = 29-126 mg DOC g(-1) C; duff = 6.5-37 mg DOC g(-1) C) and THMs and HANs (LIP to 4600 mu g-THMs g-C(-1) and 137 mu g-HANs g-C(-1)). Blue oak litter had the highest yield of DOC, THM, and HAN precursors. When scaled to the entire watershed, leachate production yielded 445 kg-DOC ha(-1), as compared to DOC export via streams of 5.25 kg-DOC ha(-1). DOC transport to surface waters is facilitated by subsurface lateral flow through A horizons during storm events. The majority of DOM and DBP precursors was leached from plant materials in the initial rainfall events and thus may explain the seasonal stream pattern of a DOC pulse early in the rainy season.									26	3	0	22	0	29			0047-2425			WOS:000271774400019	19875789

Results of cyclic laboratory tests on relatively undisturbed and reconstituted specimens suggest an increase in the correction factors of 0.12 per log cycle of time and an average reference age of 2 days for the reconstitute specimens. Laboratory and field test results combined with cyclic resistance ratio (CRR) charts suggest an increase in the correction factors of 0.13 per log cycle of time and an average reference age of 23 years. A reference age of 23 years seems appropriate for the commonly used CRR charts derived from field liquefaction and no liquefaction case history data. Because age of natural deposits is often difficult to accurately determine, a relationship between measured to estimated shear-wave velocity ratio (MEVR) and liquefaction resistance correction factor is also derived directly from the compiled data. This new MEVR-liquefaction resistance correction factor relationship is not as sensitive to MEVR as in the relationship derived indirectly in a previous paper.									17	0	0	0	0	17			1090-0241			WOS:000270913200013

Two types of energy harvesters are considered, a magnetostrictive rod in axial vibrations and a piezoelectric cantilever beam in traverse oscillations. Using generalized Hamilton's principle, the partial differential equations (PDEs) and associated boundary conditions governing the motion of these harvesters are obtained. The eigenvalue problem is then solved for the exact eigenvalues and modeshapes. Furthermore, an exact expression for the steady-sate output power is attained by direct solution of the PDEs. Subsequently, the results are compared to a ROM attained following the common Rayleigh-Ritz procedure. It is observed that the eigenvalues and output power near the first resonance frequency are more accurate and has a much faster convergence to the exact solution for the piezoelectric cantilever-type harvester. In addition, it is shown that the convergence is governed by two dimensionless constants, one that is related to the electromechanical coupling and the other to the ratio between the time constant of the mechanical oscillator and the harvesting circuit. Using these results, some interesting conclusions are drawn in regards to the design values for which the common single-mode ROM is accurate. It is also shown that the number of modes necessary for convergence should be obtained at maximum electric loading for the piezoelectric harvester and at minimum electric loading in the magnetostrictive case.									10	1	0	0	0	11			1045-389X			WOS:000270992000008		
J	Stanley, David W.; Shapiro, Martin								Eicosanoids influence insect susceptibility to nucleopolyhedroviruses								JOURNAL OF INVERTEBRATE PATHOLOGY				102	3			245	249		10.1016/j.jip.2009.09.002			NOV 2009	2009	Nine pharmaceutical inhibitors of eicosanoid biosynthesis (e.g., bromophenacyl bromide, clotrimazole, diclofenamic acid, esculetin, flufenamic acid, indomethacin, nimesulide, sulindac, tolfenamic acid) that increased the susceptibility of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.), to the nucleopolyhedrovirus LdMNPV were tested against the beet armyworm Spodoptera exigua (Hubner), the corn earworm Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) and the fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) and their respective NPVs to determine whether these Compounds also alter the susceptibility of these insects. The susceptibility of the beet armyworm was increased by six inhibitors (bromophenacyl bromide, clotrimazole, diclofenic acid, esculetin, flufenamic acid, nimesulide). The Susceptibility of the fall armyworm was increased by seven inhibitors, (bromophenacyl bromide, diclofenamic acid, esculetin, indomethacin, nimesulide, sulindac, tolfenamic acid), whereas the Susceptibility of the corn earworm was increased by only one inhibitor (sulindac). The influence of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin was expressed in a concentration-related manner in beet armyworms. We infer from these findings that eicosanoids, including prostaglandins and lipoxygenase products, act in insect anti-viral defenses.

J	Grujicic, M.; Pandurangan, B.; Bell, W. C.; Coutris, N.; Cheeseman, B. A.; Fountzoulas, C.; Patel, P.; Templeton, D. W.; Bishnoi, K. D.								An Improved Mechanical Material Model for Ballistic Soda-Lime Glass								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				18	8			1012	1028		10.1007/s11665-008-9343-0			NOV 2009	2009	In our recent work (Grujicic et al., Int. J. Impact Eng., 2008), various open-literature experimental findings pertaining to the ballistic behavior of soda-lime glass were used to construct a simple, physically based, high strain rate, high-pressure, large-strain mechanical model for this material. The model was structured in such a way that it is suitable for direct incorporation into standard commercial transient non-linear dynamics finite element-based software packages like ANSYS/Autodyn (Century Dynamics Inc., 2007) or ABAQUS/Explicit (Dessault Systems, 2007). To validate the material model, a set of finite element analyses of the edge-on-impact tests was conducted and the results compared with their experimental counterparts obtained in the recent work of Strassburger et al. (Proceedings of the 23rd International Symposium on Ballistics, Spain, April 2007; Proceedings of the 22nd International Symposium on Ballistics, November 2005, Vancouver, Canada). In general, a good agreement was found between the computational and the experimental results relative to: (a) the front shapes and the propagation velocities of the longitudinal and transverse waves generated in the target during impact and (b) the front shapes and propagation velocities of a coherent-damage zone (a zone surrounding the projectile/target contact surface which contains numerous micron and submicron-size cracks). However, substantial computational analysis/experiment disagreements were found relative to the formation of crack centers, i.e. relative to the presence and distribution of isolated millimeter-size cracks nucleated ahead of the advancing coherent-damage zone front. In the present work, it was shown that these disagreements can be substantially reduced if the glass model (Grujicic et al., Int. J. Impact Eng., 2008) is advanced to include a simple macrocracking algorithm based on the linear elastic fracture mechanics.									22	0	0	0	0	22			1059-9495			WOS:000271027100003

Field-effect is demonstrated in a device that uses facile fabrication techniques along with a small-ion as the gate electrolyte-and this is accomplished as a result of the semiconductor enhancement of the tubes. The optical transparency and electrical resistance of the device are modulated with gate voltage. A time-response study of the modulation of optical transparency and electrical resistance upon application of gate voltage suggests the percolative charge transport in the network. Also the ac response in the network is investigated as a function of frequency and temperature down to 5 K. An empirical relation between onset frequency and temperature is determined.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1533-4880			WOS:000270471100040	19908560

However, one of the challenges is developing low-cost methods to deposit films of glassy material while retaining glass stoichiometry and high film quality. In this paper. we demonstrate a spin-coating technique for the deposition of such films. The dissolution mechanisms of Ge23Sb7S70 in different solvents are studied in order to select the optimal solvent for film deposition. We show that the use of amine-based solvents allow the deposition of stoichiometric films in contrast to alkaline solutions. Films with low surface roughness (RMS roughness <5 nm) and controlled thickness (100-600 nm) can be deposited from solutions. We also show that annealing the films in vacuum decreases the amount of residual solvent, the presence of which is expected to lead to variation in optical properties of the thin films.

Determination of tritium enrichment parameters of a commercially available PEM electrolyzer: a comparison with conventional enrichment electrolysis								JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY				282	2			511	515		10.1007/s10967-009-0256-7			NOV 2009	2009	Aqueous tritium enrichment parameters of a commercially available Iridium/Platinum (Ir/Pt) polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) cell were determined after electrolysis of tritium aqueous standards, and compared to those of a conventional Nickel/Iron (Ni/Fe) electrochemical cell. Lower aqueous enrichment is seen in the Ir/Pt PEM electrolyzer in comparison to the conventional Ni/Fe electrolytic cell. This is explained by the values found for the PEM cell fractionation factor beta (Ir/Pt) and electrolytic fractionation factor beta (eIr/Pt) values determined to be 4.7 +/- A 0.3 (beta (Ni/Fe) = 26), and 6.6 +/- A 0.7 (beta (eNi/Fe) = 37), respectively. A direct consequence of the Ir/Pt beta (e) value is the richer tritium gas phase produced relative to the conventional cell, which is advantageous for direct reduction of HTO to HT gas.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0236-5731			WOS:000271672300036

The goal of the detection system is to quantify at concentrations below the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) primary drinking water standard (740 Bq/L) with minimal expendables. The detector operating voltage, efficiency, background count rate of the passively shielded counter were measured in order to calculate the minimum detectable concentration of the detection system. The electrolyzer fractionation factor beta (e) value deduced from the measurement of gas phase activity concentrations generated from tritium aqueous standards was found in good agreement with literature values.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0236-5731			WOS:000271672300037

The main focus was on strontium separation from barium, with the goal of developing an automated separation process for Sr-90 in high-level wastes. High-level waste contains significant Cs-137 activity, of which Ba-137m is of great concern as an interference to the quantification of strontium. In addition barium, yttrium and plutonium were studied as potential interferences to strontium uptake and detection. A number of complexants were studied in a series of batch K-d experiments, as SuperLig(A (R)) 620 was not previously known to elute strontium in typical mineral acids. The optimal separation was found using a 2 M nitric acid load solution with a strontium elution step of similar to 0.49 M ammonium citrate and a barium elution step of similar to 1.8 M ammonium citrate. Sr-90 quantification of Hanford high-level tank waste was performed on a sequential injection analysis microfluidics system coupled to a flow-cell detector. The results of the on-line procedure are compared to standard radiochemical techniques in this paper.									4	1	0	1	0	5			0236-5731			WOS:000271672300055

Recognizing the growing importance of disability sport to people with disabilities, the purpose of this study was to use the construct of symbolic interactionism to examine the identity development of adolescent girls with physical disabilities who participate in organized wheelchair sports with a specific focus on athletic identity development. An understanding of how the girls' interaction with various socializing agents through a wheelchair sport program to develop an athletic identity was developed through interviews.

The laser-induced defects are identified from absorption, luminescence, and Raman spectroscopy. Their linear and nonlinear optical properties are measured from Kramers-Kronig calculations and third-harmonic generation microscopy experiments. No conclusive correlation between the change in the optical properties, the initial impurity levels, and the photoinduced structures could be established based on the results obtained in this study. In addition, several hypotheses (densification and color center formation) have been rejected to explain why the linear and nonlinear optical properties of the photoinduced structures follow a contradicting evolution. This phenomenon is attributed to an experimental artifact on the measurement of the third-order susceptibility due to scattering of the photoinduced structures.

This study examines experiential aspects of transportation on Acadia National Park's primary scenic road - Ocean Drive. Interviews with vehicle-based road users were conducted to identify indicators to measure and manage experiential quality on Ocean Drive. Also, a survey was conducted to make comparisons with important variables identified on "transportation-only" urban roads. Results suggest that (I) Ocean Drive is important to park visitors' experience; (2) experiential indicators for Ocean Drive include vehicle crowding, scenery, and travel freedom/convenience; and (3) experiential aspects of transportation on scenic roads in parks may differ substantially from urban roads. Study findings suggest a need to deliberately and thoughtfully plan and manage for quality recreational experiences on roads in national parks and related areas. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Such an approach can undermine the potential for a dynamic, intimate relationship to exist between residents and tourists. This research offers the theory of emotional solidarity, put forth by Emile Durkheim, as a theoretical framework to examine the relationship between residents and tourists. In addition, a series of focus groups with residents of a coastal South Carolina county was conducted to ascertain residents' feelings about tourists and commonalities with tourists (i.e., shared beliefs, shared behavior, and interaction). Themes corresponding to constructs from Durkheim's model were generated from the qualitative data analysis.

A systematic investigation on the growth of GaAs, GaAlAs(N), and AlAs(N) at low temperatures (< 300 degrees C) on various substrates has been carried out to determine the effects of constituent elements of the alloy and the growth process parameters on the surface morphology and structural and optical properties of the materials. Optimized growth conditions were thus established for the successful growth of GaAlAsN polycrystalline layers with an average transmission of 80% in the visible region, with optical absorption energy >3.0 eV. The surface exhibited meandering cracks, with root mean square roughness of about 1 nm in the smooth areas between the cracks. Peaks observed in the x-ray diffraction and Raman spectra of these layers were relatively sharp in comparison to the other unoptimized quaternary layers, clearly attesting to the better quality of these layers. In addition, these layers exhibit preferential Al-N bond formation as evidenced in the corresponding Raman spectra.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1071-1023			WOS:000272803400015

Fully coupled atmosphere-land surface-lake climate models that could be used for both of these types of study simultaneously do not presently exist, though there are many applications that would benefit from such models. It is argued here that current understanding of physical and biogeochemical processes in freshwater systems is sufficient to begin to construct such models, and a path forward is proposed. The largest impediment to fully representing lakes in the climate system lies in the handling of lakes that are too small to be explicitly resolved by the climate model, and that make up the majority of the lake-covered area at the resolutions currently used by global and regional climate models. Ongoing development within the hydrological sciences community and continual improvements in model resolution should help ameliorate this issue.									41	3	0	19	0	44			0024-3590			WOS:000272785700004

Design and acceleration of phase-only filter-based optical pattern recognition for fingerprint identification								OPTICAL ENGINEERING				48	11					117206	10.1117/1.3265549			NOV 2009	2009	We present the use of phase-only filter-based correlation for fingerprint pattern identification. The main advantage of this approach is that it is distortion tolerant and can be realized in optical or electronic parallel hardware. Given that real-world fingerprints are almost never perfect, distortion tolerance can prove to be very important for this application. Our results indicate that the algorithm can identify prints with 58% of the data missing on average. With large fingerprint databases, identification can be a computationally challenging task. The high parallelism in the phase-only correlation filter makes it ideally suited to field programmable gate array (FPGA)-based hardware acceleration. We examine the FPGA-based acceleration of the fingerprint algorithm. On a Xilinx Virtex II Pro FPGA, we achieve speedups of about 47 times over an optimized C implementation of the algorithm on a 2.2-GHz AMD Opteron processor. Our FPGA implementation is optimized to allow efficient processing of large databases. (C) 2009 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

The FG-nanoclay composite material functioned as the oxygen barrier layer and demonstrated comparable oxygen barrier properties when compared with a similar laminate utilizing ethylene vinyl alcohol as the barrier layer at a relative humidity (RH) of up to 50%. The introduction of nanometer-sized filler clay into the FG matrix lowered the oxygen permeability (OP) because of the tortuosity effect of the clay particles. In addition, the FG-nanoclay composite film exhibited bond strengths similar to both LDPE and PET. The hydrophilic nature of FG significantly increases OP under high (>50%) RH conditions. However, this new FG laminate film could be a possible alternative for packaging designers desiring a more sustainable packaging material for low-RH (<50%) applications.

Finite element analysis of the effect of up-armouring on the off-road braking and sharp-turn performance of a high-mobility multi-purpose wheeled vehicle								PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART D-JOURNAL OF AUTOMOBILE ENGINEERING				223	D11			1419	1434		10.1243/09544070JAUTO1187			NOV 2009	2009	A comprehensive finite element investigation is carried out of the effect of up-armouring on the off-road performance of a prototypical high-mobility multi-purpose wheeled vehicle. The effect of up-armouring on the vehicle performance was investigated under the following off-road manoeuvres: straight-line flat-land braking; straight-line off-angle downhill braking; sharp left turn. In each case, the appropriate vehicle performance criteria are identified and the parameters used to quantify these criteria are defined and assessed. The computational results obtained clearly revealed the compromises in vehicle off-road performance caused by the up-armouring employed to improve vehicle blast and ballistic protection performance and survivability. The results obtained are also analysed and explained in terms of general field-test observations in order to judge the physical soundness and fidelity of the present computational approach. Finally, the potential benefits and ramifications of lightweight up-armouring in providing the needed level of blast and/or ballistic performance while causing fewer compromises in the vehicle off-road performance are also discussed.									12	0	0	0	0	12			0954-4070			WOS:000272265500005

Affordance-based design methods for innovative design, redesign and reverse engineering								RESEARCH IN ENGINEERING DESIGN				20	4			225	239		10.1007/s00163-009-0064-7			NOV 2009	2009	Rather than developing methods to address problems as they occur, the effort in this paper is to formulate methods based on an explicit theory. Methods developed in this way have more scientific rigor because underlying propositions and assumptions are clearly articulated, thus the applicability and limitations of the methods are well defined. The underlying theory used in this work is that of affordance-based design, which has been developed by the authors in a recent series of papers, and is based in turn on the theory of affordances from perceptual psychology. This paper extends affordance-based design into prescriptive methods. A broad affordance-based design process is introduced together with methods for documenting affordances, methods for designing individual affordances, an affordance-based method for reverse engineering and redesign, the affordance structure matrix, and affordance-based selection matrices. Engineering examples used to illustrate the methods include the high level design of an automobile, comfort to automobile passengers, the meshing of gears, wear of gears, a vacuum cleaner, and automotive window switches.									44	2	0	0	0	46			0934-9839			WOS:000271419100002

Use of the high resolution JY RF-5000 polychromator allows simultaneous, multielement analysis; a necessary requirement for comprehensive speciation analysis. Parametric optimization was performed for the nebulization conditions, desolvation temperature, glow discharge Current and pressure, and the source block temperature (vaporization) using nitrate salts containing lead, nickel, and silver. Peak area, height. and width were recorded for optical emission of Pb (1) 220.35 nm, Ni (1) 341.41 nm. and Ag (1) 338.28 nm in order to determine optimal peak characteristics under chromatographic separation conditions. Response curves for a multielement salt solution containing Pb, Ni, and Ag were obtained using the optimized conditions, with detection limits for triplicate injections of 2.2, 0.17. and 0.19 ng, respectively. The ability to monitor multiple elements simultaneously reveals the existence of interelement matrix effects that have not been noted previously in hollow cathode devices.

J	Sun, Xiaoqian; He, Zhuoqiong; Zhang, Jing; Kabrick, John								Bayesian spatial models with repeated measurements: with application to the herbaceous data analysis								STATISTICAL METHODS AND APPLICATIONS				18	4			585	601		10.1007/s10260-009-0114-3			NOV 2009	2009	This paper proposes a new statistical spatial model to analyze and predict the coverage percentage of the upland ground flora in the Missouri Ozark Forest Ecosystem Project (MOFEP). The flora coverage percentages are collected from clustered locations, which requires a new spatial model other than the traditional kriging method. The proposed model handles this special data structure by treating the flora coverage percentages collected from the clustered locations as repeated measurements in a Bayesian hierarchical setting. The correlation among the observations from the clustered locations are considered as well. The total vegetation coverage data in MOFEP is analyzed in this study. An Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm based on the shrinkage slice sampler is developed for simulation from the posterior densities. The total vegetation coverage is modeled by three components, including the covariates, random spatial effect and correlated random errors. Prediction of the total vegetation coverage at unmeasured locations is developed.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1618-2510			WOS:000270985700008		
J	Kothapalli, Chandrasekhar R.; Gacchina, Carmen E.; Ramamurthi, Anand								Utility of Hyaluronan Oligomers and Transforming Growth Factor-Beta1 Factors for Elastic Matrix Regeneration by Aneurysmal Rat Aortic Smooth Muscle Cells								TISSUE ENGINEERING PART A				15	11			3247	3260		10.1089/ten.tea.2008.0593			NOV 2009	2009	The progression of aortic aneurysms (AAs) is typically associated with an activated smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotype, diminished density of mature medial elastic fibers, and an elevated presence of matrix-degrading enzymes, which ultimately leads to vessel rupture. Currently, no surgical or nonsurgical methods are available to regress aneurysms via regeneration of new elastic matrices, particularly because of inherently poor elastin synthesis by adult vascular cells and absence of tools to stimulate the same. We seek to address this void in this study. We recently showed 0.2 mu g/mL of hyaluronan oligomers and 1 ng/mL of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (termed elastogenic factors) to dramatically enhance elastin synthesis and matrix formation by healthy aortic SMCs. In this study, the effect of these factors, alone or together, on suppressing procalcific and elastolytic activities of aneurysmal vascular cells, and improving their elastin matrix synthesis and assembly is examined. Periadventitial injury with calcium chloride was used to induce AAs in rats, and similar to 45% increase in aortic diameter was observed after 4 weeks. Aneurysmal SMCs isolated from these AA segments produced higher levels of inflammatory markers matrix metalloproteinases-2 and 9 elastase activity and calcific deposits, while synthesizing significantly less collagen, tropoelastin, and matrix elastin proteins over a 3-week culture period, relative to healthy SMCs. While hyaluronan oligomers alone significantly suppressed aneurysmal cell proliferation and promoted 20-50% increases in collagen and elastin synthesis (p<0.01), transforming growth factor-beta 1 alone had no effect on cellular proliferation and elastin synthesis. However, provision of factors together resulted in significantly higher amounts of collagen/elastin protein synthesis and crosslinking, by upregulating lysyl oxidase and desmosine. Compared to their individual contributions, the factors together were highly effective in minimizing the release of inflammatory enzymes, and encouraging elastic fiber formation. Since elastic matrix amounts were one order of magnitude lower than that observed with healthy cells, even upon elastogenic stimulation at doses optimized previously for healthy cells, increased doses are likely required and must be reoptimized for diseased cells. Despite this, the results point to the potential utility of these elastogenic factors in regenerating elastic matrices within AAs.									11	0	0	9	0	11			1937-3341			WOS:000271746800005	19374489	
J	Thomson, Susanne A.; Baldwin, William S.; Wang, Ying H.; Kwon, Gwijun; LeBlanc, Gerald A.								Annotation, phylogenetics, and expression of the nuclear receptors in Daphnia pulex								BMC GENOMICS				10						500	10.1186/1471-2164-10-500			OCT 28 2009	2009	Background: The nuclear receptor superfamily currently consists of seven gene subfamilies that encompass over 80 distinct receptor proteins. These transcription factors typically share a common five-domain structure with a highly conserved DNA-binding domain. Some nuclear receptors are ubiquitous among the metazoans, while others are unique to specific phylogenetic groups. Crustaceans represent the second largest group of arthropods with insects being the largest. However, relative to insects, little is known about the nuclear receptors of crustaceans. The aim of this study was to identify putative nuclear receptors from the first assembled genome of a crustacean Daphnia pulex http://wFleaBase.org. Nuclear receptor expression was evaluated and receptors were subjected to phylogenetic analyses to gain insight into evolution and function.Results: Twenty-five putative nuclear receptors were identified in D. pulex based on the presence of a conserved DNA-binding domain. All of the nuclear receptor protein sequences contain a highly homologous DNA-binding domain and a less conserved ligand-binding domain with the exception of the NR0A group. These receptors lack a ligand-binding domain. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of all seven receptor subfamilies. The D. pulex genome contains several nuclear receptors that have vertebrate orthologs. However, several nuclear receptor members that are represented in vertebrates are absent from D. pulex. Notable absences include receptors of the 1C group (peroxisome proliferators-activated receptors), the 3A group (estrogen receptor), and the 3C group (androgen, progestogen, mineralcorticoid, and glucocorticoid receptors). The D. pulex genome also contains nuclear receptor orthologs that are present in insects and nematodes but not vertebrates, including putative nuclear receptors within the NR0A group. A novel group of receptors, designated HR97, was identified in D. pulex that groups with the HR96/CeNHR8/48/DAF12 clade, but forms its own sub-clade. Gene products were detected in adult female D. pulex for 21 of the 25 receptors.Conclusion: Nuclear receptors are ancient proteins with highly conserved DNA-binding domains. The DNAbinding domains of the nuclear receptors of D. pulex contain the same degree of conservation that is typically found within nuclear receptors of other species. Most of the receptors identified in D. pulex have orthologs within the vertebrate and invertebrate lineages examined with the exception of the novel HR97 group and the Dappu-HR10 and potentially the Dappu-HR11 receptors found in D. pulex. These groups of receptors may harbour functions that are intrinsic to crustacean physiology.									37	1	1	37	0	39			1471-2164			WOS:000271883000002	19863811

Both processes are required to represent adequately the adsorption profile over the entire progression to pseudoequilibrium. Insight into the relative importance of the two processes, the terminus of the diffusion-dominated regime, and differences between diffusion in free Solution and in confinement is also provided. The results demonstrate commonality between adsorption of micelle-forming surfactant-like copolymers and biomimetic vesicles formed by small-molecule surfactants, both of which are systems dominated by rearrangements on the surface.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0024-9297			WOS:000270807300040

Interdiffusion of Short Chain Oligomers into an Entangled Polymer Film								MACROMOLECULES				42	20			7969	7973		10.1021/ma9013109			OCT 27 2009	2009	The crossover from a simple liquid to an unentangled oligomer diffusing into liquid and glassy entangled polymer matrices is studied by molecular dynamics simulations. The oligomer film is described by a bead-spring model of chain length N(o) = 10 and 50 while the polymer matrix consist of chains of length N(p) = 500. Results are compared to interdiffusion into an unentangled polymer matrix of chain length N(p) = 50. Diffusion of the oligomer into the polymer is observed in all cases as evidenced by t(1/2) scaling of both the mass uptake of the oligomer by the polymer and oligomer density profiles oil the polymer-rich side of the interface as a function of time t. Oil the oligomer-rich side, the scaling exponent is less than 1/2 due to the swelling of the polymer film and depends on the chain length of both the oligomer and polymer. Oligomer diffusivities into the entangled polymer matrix are highly concentration dependent, in contrast to a nearly constant diffusivity for penetration into the unentangled polymer. The roughness of the polymer Film evolves as t(0.2) for both liquid and glassy films.									5	1	0	0	0	5			0024-9297			WOS:000270807300048

In this work, the effect of Fe on Rh-La-V/SiO2 was examined and the role of each individual promoter was further scrutinized. Several series of promoted Rh/SiO2 catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness and characterized by BET, XRD, TEM. FTIR, TPR, and H-2-TPD. The catalytic activity was tested using a fixed-bed differential reactor at 230 degrees C and 1.8 atm. It was found that the addition of 0.8 wt% Fe, 2.6 wt% La, and 1.5 wt% V to 1.5 wt% Rh/SiO2 resulted in the highest selectivity to ethanol (34.6%) and a moderate activity compared to other promoted catalysts. The investigation based on the catalytic performance and other characterizations of Rh/SiO2. promoted by different promoters suggests that the primary promoting effects of La, V, and Fe are different. The main effects of the addition of different promoters in this study appear to be increasing CO adsorption and insertion for La, decreasing CO adsorption but enhancing CO dissociation and chain growth for V, and decreasing CO adsorption but enhancing hydrogenation for Fe. The synergistic effects of the multiple promoters indicate that the key in catalyst design for ethanol synthesis from syngas is to optimize CO dissociation, hydrogenation. and CO insertion in a balanced way.

J	Russell, Anthony P.; Higham, Timothy E.								A new angle on clinging in geckos: incline, not substrate, triggers the deployment of the adhesive system								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES				276	1673			3705	3709		10.1098/rspb.2009.0946			OCT 22 2009	2009	Lizards commonly climb in complex three-dimensional habitats, and gekkotans are particularly adept at doing this by using an intricate adhesive system involving setae on the ventral surface of their digits. However, it is not clear whether geckos always deploy their adhesive system, given that doing so may result in decreased (i.e. reduction in speed) locomotor performance. Here, we investigate circumstances under which the adhesive apparatus of clinging geckos becomes operative, and examine the potential tradeoffs between speed and clinging. We quantify locomotor kinematics of a gecko with adhesive capabilities (Tarentola mauritanica) and one without (Eublepharis macularius). Whereas, somewhat unusually, E. macularius did not suffer a decrease in locomotor performance with an increase in incline, T. mauritanica exhibited a significant decrease in speed between the level and a 108 incline. We demonstrate that this results from the combined influence of slope and the deployment of the adhesive system. All individuals kept their digits hyperextended on the level, but three of the six individuals deployed their adhesive system on the 108 incline, and they exhibited the greatest decrease in velocity. The deployment of the adhesive system was dependent on incline, not surface texture (600 grit sandpaper and Plexiglas), despite slippage occurring on the level Plexiglas substrate. Our results highlight the type of sensory feedback (gravity) necessary for deployment of the adhesive system, and the trade-offs associated with adhesion.									40	1	0	31	0	40			0962-8452			WOS:000270172200017	19656797

Mote, Thomas/0000-0002-0021-0134			A storage model approach to the assessment of snow depth trends								WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH				45						W10426	10.1029/2009WR007996			OCT 20 2009	2009	This paper introduces a stochastic storage model capable of assessing trends in daily snow depth series. The model allows for seasonal features, which permits the analysis of daily data. Breakpoint times, which occur when the observing station changes location or instrumentation, are shown to greatly influence estimated trend margins and are accounted for in this analysis. The model is fitted by numerically minimizing a sum of squares of daily prediction errors. Standard errors for the model parameters, useful in making trend inferences, are presented. The methods are illustrated in the analysis of a century of daily snow depth observations from Napoleon, North Dakota. The results here show that snow depths are significantly declining at Napoleon, with spring ablation occurring earlier, and that breakpoint features are very influential in deriving realistic trend estimates.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0043-1397			WOS:000271135700002

This work was conducted with a view to explaining the unexpected observation that litchi polyphenol oxidase (PPO) did not oxidise directly anthocyanins. Litchi fruit were stored for 4 days at 25 degrees C and 80-90% relative humidity. Browning index and H2O2 and (OH)-O-center dot contents of pericarp tissues of litchi fruit during storage were determined. The browning index of litchi fruit rapidly increased while H2O2 and (OH)-O-center dot contents decreased and then increased markedly, as storage time progressed. The obvious pericarp browning was associated with the rapid increases in H2O2 and (OH)-O-center dot contents of litchi fruit after 4 days of storage. Furthermore, litchi anthocyanins were purified by column chromatography and then H2O2 and hydroxyl radical were used to examine their degradation roles in the purified anthocyanin. It was found that the purified litchi anthocyanin was degraded markedly in the presence of H2O2 or hydroxyl radical. Increasing concentration of H2O2 or hydroxyl radical enhanced the anthocyanin degradation. of which the latter exhibited a greater effect on the anthocyanin degradation although no peak of litchi anthocyanin appeared after the treatment with 0.1% H2O2 for 10 min. This study can account for the pericarp browning of postharvest litchi fruit during storage based on the oxidative degradation of anthocyanin caused by Pro. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

For the AZ91 alloy, the results indicate a mixed mode of creep behavior, with some grain boundary effects contributing to the overall behavior. However for the RE and Si added samples, sliding of grain boundaries was greatly suppressed and the dislocation climb controlled creep was the dominant deformation mechanism. Analysis of creep rates also showed that the Si addition resulted in formation of Mg(2)Si particles (in Chinese Script form) which have a high thermal stability. After Si addition the steady state creep rates were decreased and the creep resistance was improved. This was due to formation of Mg(2)Si particles which change the deformation mechanism at elevated temperatures. Addition of cerium rich misch metal to AZ91 alloy resulted in formation of needle shape particles, which also had a very high thermal stability, providing increased creep resistance and superior mechanical properties compared to AZ91 magnesium alloy. As a result, the grain boundaries were less susceptible for grain boundary sliding at high temperatures. By decreasing the Al content of the alloy having 2 wt.% RE from 9 to 4 wt.%, the steady state creep rate was also decreased compared to AZ91 + 2% RE alloy. The fracture mechanism was also investigated and it was observed that although the Si addition improves the creep resistance, it can make the alloy brittle at ambient temperature.

The execution of deep cryogenic treatment on samples changed the distribution of beta precipitates. The tiny laminar beta particles almost dissolved in the microstructure and the coarse divorced eutectic beta phase penetrated into the matrix. This microstructural modification resulted in a significant improvement on mechanical properties of the alloy. The steady state creep rates were measured and it was found that the creep behavior of the alloy, which is dependent on the stability of the near grain boundary microstructure, was improved by the deep cryogenic treatment. For the AZ91 alloy, the results indicate a mixed mode of creep behavior, with some grain boundary effects contributing to the overall behavior. However for the deep cryogenic samples dislocation climb controlled creep is the dominant deformation mechanism. After the deep cryogenic treatment the sliding of grain boundaries was greatly suppressed due to morphological changes. As a result, the grain boundaries are less susceptible for grain boundary sliding at high temperatures. Dry sliding wear tests were also applied and the wear resistance of the alloy improved remarkably after deep cryogenic treatment. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles were characterized by various techniques, and uniform nanoparticles with an average particle size of 116 +/- 15 nm with high encapsulation efficiencies (EE) were obtained. Additionally, a sustained release of paclitaxel from paclitaxel-loaded chitosan nanoparticles was successful. Using different ratios of paclitaxel-to-chitosan, the EE ranged from 32.2 +/- 8.21% to 94.0 +/- 16.73%. The drug release rates of paclitaxel from the nanoparticles were approximately, 26.55 +/- 2.11% and 93.44 +/- 10.96% after 1 day and 13 days, respectively, suggesting the potential of the chitosan nanoparticles as a sustained drug delivery system. cytotoxicity tests showed that the paclitaxel-loaded chitosan had higher cell toxicity than the individual paclitaxel and confocal microscopy analysis confirmed excellent cellular uptake efficiency. TEM images showed the ultrastructure changes of A2780 cells incubated with paclitaxel-loaded nanoparticles. Flow cytometric analysis revealed two subdiploid peaks for the cells in the paclitaxel-loaded nanoparticles and paclitaxel treated groups, respectively, with the intensity of the former higher than that of the latter. Moreover, the cell cycle was arrested in the G(2)-M phase, which was consistent with the action mechanism of the direct administration of paclitaxel. These results indicate that chitosan nanoparticles have potential uses as anticancer drug carriers and also have an enhanced anticancer effect. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Extracellular matrices, such as collagen, gelatin, and laminin, have excellent biocompatibility and allow cell in growth and survival, but structural weakness makes them difficult to handle and greatly limits their uses. Degradable nanofibers support cell attachment and can provide structural support and directional guidance, but individual degradable nanofibers are fragile and have a tendency to form dense fiber bundles which limit cell penetration into the spaces between the nanofibers. especially in the case of aligned nanofibers. To overcome these difficulties, degradable loose nanofibers were embedded in protein matrix in an attempt to fabricate a hybrid scaffold with improved properties, such as improved strength, guidance, spacing among nanofibers, etc, Polycaprolactone (PCL) was used as a model material for degradable nanofibers. Gelatin was employed as a model protein for matrix structure formation. Thin hybrid films (average thickness = 2.78 um) were fabricated by wetting the loose aligned undirectional nanofiber arrays or loose aligned bi-directional nanofiber grids with a gelatin aqueous solution, which also allows for live cell loading into the nanofiber-protein composite if cell are premixed with protein solution or on the surface of the films. Gelatin film alone without nanofiber reinforcement is difficult to handle due to the weakness of the thin membrane. Gelatin films with a fiber density as low as 3% v/v were structurally robust enough for handling, and manipulation into complex shapes. Mechanical testing confirmed that the addition of nanofibers enhanced the strength of gelatin films, in both dry and hydrated state. In vitro testing confirmed that nanofiber reinforced films were biocompatible and provided cells with directional guidance. Results demonstrate the promise of gelatin/PCL nanofiber composites as a tissue scaffolding material. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Zero knowledge hidden Markov model inference								PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS				30	14			1273	1280		10.1016/j.patrec.2009.06.008			OCT 15 2009	2009	Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are widely used in pattern recognition. HMM construction requires an initial model structure that is used as a starting point to estimate the model's parameters. To construct a HMM without a priori knowledge of the structure, we use an approach developed by Crutchfield and Shalizi that requires only a sequence of observations and a maximum data window size. Values of the maximum data window size that are too small result in incorrect models being constructed. Values that are too large reduce the number of data samples that can be considered and exponentially increase the algorithm's computational complexity. In this paper, we present a method for automatically inferring this parameter directly from training data as part of the model construction process. We present theoretical and experimental results that confirm the utility of the proposed extension. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

A Box-Behnken design was applied to investigate the effects of ultrasonic temperature (30-70 degrees C), power (120-300 W), and time (10-50 min) on OLFP recovery. The model showed a good agreement with the experimental results on the basis of R(2) of 0.9655 and P-value <0.05. From response surface plots, ultrasonic power, time, and temperature exhibited independent and interactive effects on OLFP recovery. The optimal conditions to obtain the highest OLFP recovery were determined to be 13 min, 121 W, and 65 degrees C. Gas chromatography analysis indicated that purified OLFP comprised Gal (71.5%), GIc (24.6%), and GaIA (3.9%). The analysis of glycosidic linkages showed that the backbone consisted of -> 3)-Gal-(1 ->, -> 6)-Gal-(1 ->, GIc-(1 -> and -> 3)-GaIA-(l -> with a molar proportion of 13:5:6:1. Furthermore, the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryldydrazyl (DPPH) and superoxide anion radical scavenging assays showed that OLFP exhibited strong antioxidant activities in a dose-dependent manner.									21	1	0	14	0	22			0021-8561			WOS:000270461500079	19739643

Experimental and simulation studies of a real-time polymerase chain reaction in the presence of a fullerene derivative								NANOTECHNOLOGY				20	41					415101	10.1088/0957-4484/20/41/415101			OCT 14 2009	2009	The real-time polymerase chain reaction of the plant gene heat shock transcription factor was fully inhibited in the presence of a fullerene derivative C-60(OH)(20) at a concentration of 4 x 10(-4) mM. This inhibition was attributed to the interaction between the nanoparticle and Taq DNA polymerase in the reaction. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations showed a clear tendency for hydrogen bonding between C-60(OH)(20) and both the dNTPs and ssDNA components of the polymerase chain reaction. These studies facilitate our understanding of the fate of nanoparticles in biomolecular systems, a topic of tremendous importance for addressing the biological and environmental implications of nanomaterials.									16	0	0	7	0	16			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000269930100002

Silica-coated NaYF(4) upconversion nanoparticles (UCNs) co-doped with lanthanide ions (Yb/Er) were synthesized. Folic acid and anti-Her2 antibody conjugated UCNs were used to fluorescently label the folate receptors of HT-29 cells and Her2 receptors of SK-BR-3 cells, respectively. The intracellular uptake of the folic acid and antibody conjugated UCNs was visualized using a confocal fluorescence microscope equipped with an NIR laser. siRNA was attached to anti-Her2 antibody conjugated UCNs and the delivery of these nanoparticles to SK-BR-3 cells was studied. Meanwhile, a luciferase assay was established to confirm the gene silencing effect of siRNA. Upconversion nanoparticles can serve as a fluorescent probe and delivery system for simultaneous imaging and delivery of biological molecules.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1361-6528		MEDLINE:19420539	19420539

For ease of assembly and testing, the nanoparticles are embedded onto the surface of flexible resin films, which are then simply adhered on top of the light emitting samples. Large enhancements in photoluminescence efficiency are correspondingly measured at emission wavelengths near the nanoparticle plasmonic resonance. At the same time, when samples emitting at a sufficiently far detuned wavelength are used, the measured efficiency is not affected by the nanoparticles, which confirms the plasmonic origin of the observed enhancement.

By utilizing two ternary (meth)acrylate networks, MA-co-MMA-co-PEGDMA and 2HEMA-co-BMA-co-PEGDMA, relationships between glass transition temperature (T(g)), water content and state, and toughness were studied by varying the weight ratio of the linear monomers (MA to MMA or 2HEMA to BMA). Differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis were performed to evaluate the thermal behavior and water content as a function of either MA or 2HEMA concentration while tensile strain-to-failure tests were performed at 37 degrees C to determine network toughness. Both networks exhibited a maximum in toughness in PBS in the composition corresponding to a T(g) close to the testing temperature. This toughness maximum was achieved by adjusting the glass transition temperature and/or hydrophilicity through changes in chemistry. These relationships may be utilized to design tough photopolymerizable networks for use in mechanically rigorous biomedical applications. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) was micropatterned on PLA using photolithography in step 1, followed by carbodiimide wet chemistry to covalently attach biotin to acid groups in step 2. The PAA micropatterning reaction progression was monitored using attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FT-IR) spectroscopy, water contact angle goniometry, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The PAA-biotin conjugation reaction characterization using XPS confirmed the carbodiimide mediated amidation reaction.

Functional gene silencing mediated by chitosan/siRNA nanocomplexes								NANOTECHNOLOGY				20	40					405103	10.1088/0957-4484/20/40/405103			OCT 7 2009	2009	Chitosan/siRNA nanoparticles to knock down FHL2 gene expression were reported in this work. The physicochemical properties such as particle size, surface charge, morphology and complex stability of chitosan nanoparticle-incorporated siRNA were evaluated. Nanoparticles which were formulated with chitosan/siRNA exhibited irregular, lamellar and dendritic structures with a hydrodynamic radius size of about 148 nm and net positive charges with zeta-potential value of 58.5 mV. The knockdown effect of the chitosan/siRNA nanoparticles on gene expression in FHL2 over-expressed human colorectal cancer Lovo cells was investigated. The result showed that FHL2 siRNA formulated within chitosan nanoparticles could knock down about 69.6% FHL2 gene expression, which is very similar to the 68.8% reduced gene expression when siRNA was transfected with liposome Lipofectamine. Western analysis further showed significant FHL-2 protein expression reduced by the chitosan/siRNA nanoparticles. The results also showed that blocking FHL2 expression by siRNA could also inhibit the growth and proliferation of human colorectal cancer Lovo cells. The current results demonstrated that chitosan-based siRNA nanoparticles were a very efficient delivery system for siRNA in vivo as previously reported.									31	2	0	22	0	33			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000269929900003	19752491

This approach utilizes statistical analysis of complex SPM responses at a single spatial location to identify the target behavior, which is reminiscent of associative thinking in the human brain, obviating the need for analytical models. We demonstrate, as an example of recognition imaging, rapid identification of cellular organisms using the difference in electromechanical activity over a broad frequency range. Single-pixel identification of model Micrococcus lysodeikticus and Pseudomonas fluorescens bacteria is achieved, demonstrating the viability of the method.									12	0	0	2	0	12			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000269929900035	19752493

It was formed by sufficiently dissolving as-grown ropes of B-SWNTs and densely assembling them on silicon substrate. We find that superconducting transition temperature (T(c)) of 8 K under absent pressure can be induced up to 19 K by applying a small pressure to the film and that a frequency in the radial breathing phonon drastically increases with applying pressure. Discussion about IVDWC and distribution of B-SWNTs diameter imply the strong correlation. (C) 2009 American Institute of Physics.

This paper reports on the beetle's distribution and host plants in South Carolina. Descriptive data on the severity of attacks in different locations and at specific heights of southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora L.) trees were also gathered. Xylosandrus compactus was trapped or observed in 18 counties in South Carolina, from the Atlantic Coast to the upper Piedmont regions. The recorded ornamental host plants of X. compactus in South Carolina include Buxus sempervirens L. (boxwood), Cercis canadensis L. (eastern redbud), Cornus florida L.

Small (wax myrtle), and Pinus sp. (pine). On average, 47% of southern magnolia trees in seven neighborhoods of North Myrtle Beach, SC suffered attacks by X. compactus. Southern magnolia terminals at a height of 0-1 m (from soil surface) suffered the highest percentage of attacks (11.1%), followed by those at 1-2 m (7.2%). The percentage of terminals attacked was reduced to less than 4% at 3-6 m. The tendency for X. compactus to infest terminals at heights less than two meters suggests that preventive insecticide applications should target the lower branches to reduce damage.									3	0	0	1	0	3			1523-5475			WOS:000207974600005

Soil respiration, which is a large component of NEE, could be strongly influential to NEE variability. Vegetation type, landscape position, and site history can influence soil properties and therefore drive the microbial and root production of soil CO(2). This study measured soil respiration and soil chemical, biological and physical properties on various types of temperate forest stands in Northern Wisconsin (USA), which included ash elm, aspen, northern hardwood, red pine forest types, clear-cuts, and wetland edges. Soil respiration at each of the 19 locations was measured six times during 1 year from early June to mid-November. These data were combined with two additional data sets from the same landscape that represent two smaller spatial scales. Large spatial variation of soil respiration occurred within and among each forest type, which appeared to be from differences in soil moisture, root mass and the ratio of soil carbon to soil nitrogen (C:N). A soil climate driven model was developed that contained quadratic functions for root mass and the ratio of soil carbon to soil nitrogen. The data from the large range of forest types and site conditions indicated that the range of root mass and C:N on the landscape was also large, and that trends between C:N, root mass, and soil respiration were not linear as previously reported, but rather curvilinear. It should be noted this function appeared to level off and decline at C:N larger than 25, approximately the value where microbial nitrogen immobilization limits free soil nitrogen. Weak but significant relationships between soil water and soil C:N, and between soil C:N and root mass were observed indicating an interrelatedness of (1) topographically induced hydrologic patterns and soil chemistry, and (2) soil chemistry and root production. Future models of soil respiration should address multiple spatial and temporal factors as well as their co-dependence. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Innovative transgenic strategies to render Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the primary vector of dengue, incompetent for dengue transmission are under development. We modeled the evolutionary impact of different transgenic mosquito strategies on dengue-induced mortality, that is, dengue virulence, to both humans and mosquitoes. This model incorporates various evolutionary trade-offs in dengue virus epidemiological traits, for example, a trade-off between dengue transmission rate and its virulence to humans. Our results indicate that strategies that block transmission or reduce mosquito biting impose selection on dengue virulence in humans. This selection can be for either higher or lower virulence, depending on the interaction between the effect of the transgene and the trade-offs in epidemiological traits, highlighting the need for detailed quantitative data to understand more fully the impact of mosquito transgenesis on dengue virulence. Dengue virulence in mosquitoes can be selected on by transgenic strategies of blocking transmission, decreased mosquito biting, increased mosquito background mortality, and increased mosquito infection-induced mortality. Our results suggest that dengue control strategies that raise mosquito background mortality or mosquito infection-induced mortality pose less risk of causing increased virulence to humans than strategies that block transmission or reduce mosquito biting.									24	0	0	23	0	25			0003-0147	1537-5323		WOS:000269824800014	19737112

This work presents a sheathless electrokinetic focusing of yeast cells in a planar serpentine microchannel using dc-biased ac electric fields. The concurrent pumping and focusing of yeast cells arise from the dc electrokinetic transport and the turn-induced ac/dc dielectrophoretic motion, respectively. The effects of electric field (including ac to dc field ratio and ac field frequency) and concentration (including buffer concentration and cell concentration) on the cell focusing performance were studied experimentally and numerically. A continuous electrokinetic filtration of E. coli cells from yeast cells was also demonstrated via their differential electrokinetic focusing in a serpentine microchannel.									43	0	0	24	0	43			1932-1058			WOS:000273217500009	20216971

These fulleropyrrolidines were fully characterized via rigorous structure determination through multiple spectral experiments, which included 1D, 2D NMR, FT-1R, MS and X-ray crystallography. During the reaction, gossypol decomposed into benzaldehyde which was successfully detected as a new intermediate through GC-MS. In an in vitro assay of NO radical induced apoptosis in 3T3L1 cells, N-methylfulleropyrrolidine (2) and N-methyl-2,2-dimethylfulleropyrrolidine (3) showed dose dependent and stronger radical scavenging activities than the parent fullerene.

J	Xiao, Feipeng; Zhao, P. E. Wenbin; Amirkhanian, Serji N.								Fatigue behavior of rubberized asphalt concrete mixtures containing warm asphalt additives								CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS				23	10			3144	3151		10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2009.06.036			OCT 2009	2009	The long-term performance of pavement is associated with various factors such as pavement structure, materials, traffic loading, and environmental conditions. Improving the understanding of the fatigue behavior of the specific rubberized warm mix asphalt (WMA) is helpful in recycling the scrap tires and saving energy. This study explores the utilization of the conventional fatigue analysis approach in investigating the fatigue life of rubberized asphalt concrete mixtures containing the WMA additive. The fatigue beams were made with one rubber type (-40 mesh ambient crumb rubber). two aggregate sources, two WMA additives (Asphamin (R) and Sasobit (R)), and tested at 20 degrees C. A total of eight mixtures were performed and 29 fatigue beams were tested in this study. The test results indicated that the addition of crumb rubber and WMA additive not only reduced the mixing and compaction temperatures of rubberized asphalt mixtures offset by crumb rubber but also effectively extended the long-term performance of pavement when compared with conventional asphalt pavement. In addition, the exponential function forms are efficient in achieving the correlations between the dissipated energy and load cycle as well as mixture stiffness and load cycle.

Here, we hypothesized that our established model could be used to determine if the SGSB was a general, non-discriminate vector by using two other opportunistic bacterial pathogens of bolls (Pantoea ananatis [Serano] and Klebsiella pneumoniae [Schroeter]) and the known fungal pathogen Nematospora coryli (Peglion). Variants of P. ananatis (strain Pa-1R) and K. pneumoniae (strain Kp 5-1R) selected for rifampicin (Rif) resistance were used as bacterial opportunists. N. coryli was detected only from laboratory-reared SGSB directly exposed to the fungus. Both Pa-1R and Kp 5-1R were recovered from SGSB previously provided a contaminated food source (2 days), sterile food (5 days), and then harvested after being caged on bolls (2 days) at levels reaching 10(3) and 10(4) colony forming units (cfus) per insect, respectively. However, bolls caged with insects infected with Pa-1R or Kp 5-1R and with evidence of feeding did not become diseased nor were either opportunists detected from boll tissues. Insects infected with N. coryli transmitted the pathogen, which resulted in diseased bolls and fungi concentrations reached 10(6) cfus/g locule tissue at 2 weeks following the caging period. Notably, each of the three pathogens independently caused boll disease when mechanically inoculated using a needle puncture. Generally, these results suggest that cotton pathogen acquisition by the SGSB was not sufficient to determine whether the insects were disease vectors of the opportunists.									16	0	0	17	0	17			0343-8651			WOS:000269857200008	19636620

It was shown that in the first case, this mutation is related with the substitution of serine residue for proline in position 248; in the second case, with the substitution of phenylalanine for serine in position 317 of the beta-tubulin's amino acid sequence. Three-dimensional models of the beta-tubulin molecule from Chlamydomonas with the well-known location of mutations determining dinitroaniline- and phosphorothioamides resistance (the substitution of lysine residue for methionine in position 350), and beta-tubulin from Nicotiana plumbagnifolia have been reconstructed. On the basis of the analysis of the interaction site for dinitroanilines and phosphorothioamides located on the Chlamydomonas beta-tubulin's molecule it was concluded that the revealed mutations on Nicotiana plumbaginifolia beta-tubulin are affected by the residues of the amino acids, participating in the formation of this site.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0095-4527			WOS:000270631100010

This study evaluated the kinetics of water uptake and percent conversion in neat versus ethanol-solvated resins that were formulated to be used as dental bonding agents.Methods. Five methacrylate-based resins of known and increasing hydrophilicities (R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5) were used as reference materials. Resins were evaluated as neat bonding agents (100% resin) or they were solvated with absolute ethanol (95% resin/5% ethanol or 85% resin/15% ethanol). Specimens were prepared by dispensing the uncured resin into a circular mold (5.8 mm x 0.8 mm). Photo-activation was performed for 80 s. The water sorption/diffusion/solubility was gravimetrically evaluated, while the degree of conversion (DC) was calculated by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy.Results. Water sorption increased with the hydrophilicity of the resin blends. In general, the solvated resins exhibited significantly higher water sorption, solubility and water diffusion coefficients when compared to their corresponding neat versions (p < 0.05). The only exception was resin R1, the least hydrophilic resin, in which neat and solvated versions exhibited similar water sorption (p > 0.05). Addition of ethanol increased the DC of all resins tested, especially of the least hydrophilic, R1 and R2 (p < 0.05). Despite the increased DC of ethanol-solvated methacrylate-based resins, it occurs at the expense of an increase in their water sorption/diffusion and solubility values.Significance. Negative effects of residual ethanol on water sorption/solubility appeared to be greater as the hydrophilicity of the resin blends increased. That is, the use of less hydrophilic resins in dental adhesives may create more reliable and durable bonds to dentin. (C) 2009 Academy of Dental Materials. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

We compared cerebrospinal fluid parameters [white blood cell count, red blood cell count, glucose, and protein], demographics, and Outcomes between infants with and without Group B streptococcal meningitis.Results: We identified 46 infants with Group B streptococcal meningitis. The median cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count was 271 cells/mm(3) for infants with Group B streptococcal meningitis and 6 cells/mm(3) for infants Without meningitis (p = 0.0001). Of the infants with Group B streptococcal meningitis, 9/46 (20%) had negative blood Cultures. Meningitis complicated 22/145 (15%) of episodes of early-onset Group B streptococcal sepsis and 13/23 (57%) of episodes of late-onset Group B Streptococcal sepsis.Conclusions: Group B streptococcal meningitis Occurs in the presence of negative blood Cultures. In hospitalized infants who undergo a lumbar Puncture, Group B streptococcal sepsis is frequently complicated by GBS meningitis. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In this article we report a similar finding about volatility in the medium term: we find evidence that reversals of trend-growth are sharper and more frequent in non-democracies. Motivated by this evidence, we construct a model in which non-democracies have high barriers to entry for new firms. This leads to less sectoral diversification and so, in an uncertain environment, to larger growth swings in less democratic countries. We present empirical evidence that confirms the positive relation between democracy and industrial diversification.									12	0	0	0	0	12			0013-0133			WOS:000269575800002

Ionic conduction in polyether-based lithium arylfluorosulfonimide ionic melt electrolytes								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				54	24			5877	5883		10.1016/j.electacta.2009.05.050			OCT 1 2009	2009	We report synthesis, characterization and ion transport in polyether-based ionic melt electrolytes consisting of Li salts of low-basicity anions covalently attached to polyether oligomers. Purity of the materials was investigated by HPLC analysis and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The highest ionic conductivity of 7.1 x 10(-6) S/cm at 30 degrees C was obtained for the sample consisting of a lithium salt of an arylfluorosulfonimide anion attached to a polyether oligomer with an ethyleneoxide (EO) to lithium ratio of 12. The conductivity order of various ionic melts having different polyether chain lengths suggests that at higher EO:Li ratios the conductivity of the electrolytes at room temperature is determined in part by the amount of crystallization of the polyether portion of the ionic melt.

Throughout this period, there has been intense conflict about whether and how to transfer water from the Bay-Delta to users elsewhere-a conflict marked by a fundamental opposition of interests among stakeholders. we document how the State of California has failed to organize itself effectively to resolve this conflict and make a decision on how to manage the Delta. The strategy consistently adopted by the State was to encourage the main parties - agricultural and urban water diverters, and fisheries and other instream-protection interests - to work out a solution among themselves, rather than imposing one externally. However, economic theory suggests that a bargaining solution is unlikely to exist because of the extreme opposition of interest among the parties. The Bay-Delta history amply confirms this theoretical prediction. Thus, the State's strategy of relying on voluntary agreement to resolve the issue is fundamentally misconceived and is, at some level, an abdication of its responsibility.

Patterns of Inheritance of Mating Signals in Sailfin and Shortfin Mollies (Poeciliidae: Poecilia: Mollienesia)								ETHOLOGY				115	10			958	971		10.1111/j.1439-0310.2009.01683.x			OCT 2009	2009	Divergence in mating signals is a primary factor leading to reproductive isolation, and thus, speciation. However, the genetic changes underlying such divergence are poorly understood, especially in vertebrates. We used two species of poeciliid fishes, Poecilia velifera and P. mexicana, to explore the link between genes and mating behaviors that has resulted in pre-mating reproductive isolation between these species. Using backcross hybrids created from the F1 male offspring of reciprocal interspecific crosses between a sailfin molly (P. velifera) and a shortfin molly (P. mexicana), we examined the effects of Y-linkage and autosomal contributions on the expression of two male mating behaviors: courtship displays and gonopodial thrusts. The F1 hybrid males displayed a strong influence of sire on courtship display rates, with F1 males sired by the sailfin species showing courtship display rates that were up to three times higher than the rates of displays performed by F1 males sired by the shortfin species. These results suggest a Y-linked genetic effect on the expression of courtship display behavior. Comparisons between backcross hybrid males with sailfin Y-chromosomes or shortfin Y-chromosomes suggested that the interaction of autosomal genes also influences the inheritance of courtship display rates. Sailfin autosomal genes significantly increased the probability of performing courtship displays for hybrid males, and increased display rate for males from the sailfin Y-chromosome line. Autosomal genes had less of an impact on gonopodial thrusting behavior, however, thrust rates did significantly decrease with an increasing proportion of sailfin autosomes in males from the shortfin Y-chromosome line. These results suggest that the inheritance of species differences in mating signals between shortfin and sailfin mollies involves both genes found on the Y-chromosome and autosomal gene influences on their expression.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0179-1613			WOS:000269539800006

This study empirically examines the value proposition of BPO with respect to the nature of the processes being outsourced. Using the event study methodology, we employ the value chain (VC) position and existing ownership of a business process as our primary independent variables, and the stock abnormal return in response to the BPO announcement as the dependent performance variable in our research model. The study was conducted on 298 BPO announcements from 1998 to 2005. Results support the argument that outsourcing is valuable for both primary and supportive business processes. However, we found that BPO announcements on primary processes yield higher abnormal returns than supportive processes. Although existing process ownership was not found to be a powerful differentiator for BPO performance, its interaction with VC position provides important insights into the timing of outsourcing. The evidence suggests that internal cultivation of processes is important for BPO success, particularly when BPO is applied to primary processes.

The long-term trend in average height was upwards for all social groups but differences in stature between social groups were about as large as in Communist Czechoslovakia as in market economies, such as the UK. Sons of blue-collar fathers and of parents employed in agriculture were generally shorter than sons of clerks and professional employees (teachers, doctors, lawyers). The anthropometric record also suggests that in the immediately post-war years inequality was greater than in the late 1950s and early 1960s. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Increases (p <= 0.05) in the nonprotein nitrogen (NPN) fraction were found at sequential stages of processing, while starter cultures had no major effects on NPN content. Concentrations of most free amino acids increased (p <= 0.05) during fermentation and drying, and culture effects were found for differences among concentrations of some individual free amino acids. From SDS-PAGE analysis of sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar protein fractions after fermentation and drying, myosin heavy and light chains, actin and troponin were degraded during processing. However, starter culture effects were absent from SDS-PAGE protein patterns. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									25	5	0	17	0	30			0308-8146	1873-7072		WOS:000267229500022

GENOME				52	10			819	828		10.1139/G09-050			OCT 2009	2009	Commercial production of apricot is severely affected by sensitivity to climatic conditions, an adaptive feature essential for cycling between vegetative or floral growth and dormancy. Yield losses are due to late winter or early spring frosts and inhibited vegetative or floral growth caused by unfulfilled chilling requirement (CR). Two apricot cultivars, Perfection and A.1740, were selected for high and low CR, respectively, to develop a mapping population of F(1) individuals using a two-way pseudo-testcross mapping strategy. High-density male and female maps were constructed using, respectively, 655 and 592 markers (SSR and AFLP) spanning 550.6 and 454.9 cM with average marker intervals of 0.84 and 0.77 cM. CR was evaluated in two seasons on potted trees forced to break buds after cold treatments ranging from 100 to 900 h. A total of 12 putative CR quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were detected on six linkage groups using composite interval mapping and a simultaneous multiple regression fit. QTL main effects of additive and additive x additive interactions accounted for 58.5% +/- 6.7% and 66.1% +/- 5.8% of the total phenotypic variance in the Perfection and A.1740 maps, respectively. We report two apricot high-density maps and QTLs corresponding to map positions of differentially expressed transcripts and suggested candidate genes controlling CR.									32	3	0	31	0	35			0831-2796			WOS:000271832300001	19935906
