The ability to predict whether a given mutation is disease-causing or harmless is of great importance for the early detection of patients with a high risk of developing a particular disease and would pave the way for personalized medicine and diagnostics. Here we review existing methods and techniques to study and predict the effects of DNA mutations from three different perspectives: in silico, in vitro and in vivo. It is emphasized that the problem is complicated and successful detection of a pathogenic mutation frequently requires a combination of several methods and a knowledge of the biological phenomena associated with the corresponding macromolecules.									13	0	0	8	1	14			1422-0067			WOS:000338639000028	24886813

Paradox of the drinking-straw model of the butterfly proboscis								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY				217	12			2130	2138		10.1242/jeb.097998			JUN 2014	2014	Fluid-feeding Lepidoptera use an elongated proboscis, conventionally modeled as a drinking straw, to feed from pools and films of liquid. Using the monarch butterfly, Danaus plexippus (Linnaeus), we show that the inherent structural features of the lepidopteran proboscis contradict the basic assumptions of the drinking-straw model. By experimentally characterizing permeability and flow in the proboscis, we show that tapering of the food canal in the drinking region increases resistance, significantly hindering the flow of fluid. The calculated pressure differential required for a suction pump to support flow along the entire proboscis is greater than 1 atm (similar to 101 kPa) when the butterfly feeds from a pool of liquid. We suggest that behavioral strategies employed by butterflies and moths can resolve this paradoxical pressure anomaly. Butterflies can alter the taper, the interlegular spacing and the terminal opening of the food canal, thereby controlling fluid entry and flow, by splaying the galeal tips apart, sliding the galeae along one another, pulsing hemolymph into each galeal lumen, and pressing the proboscis against a substrate. Thus, although physical construction of the proboscis limits its mechanical capabilities, its functionality can be modified and enhanced by behavioral strategies.									9	0	0	9	0	11			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000338521400018	24920837

Food Consumption and Growth Rates of Juvenile Black Carp Fed Natural and Prepared Feeds								JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT				5	1			35	45		10.3996/112012-JFWM-101			JUN 2014	2014	The introduced mollusciphagic black carp Mylopharyngodon piceus poses a significant threat to native mollusks in temperate waters throughout the northern hemisphere, but consumption rates necessary to estimate the magnitude of impact on mollusks have not been established. We measured food consumption and growth rates for small (77-245 g) and large (466-1,071 g) triploid black carp held individually under laboratory conditions at 20, 25, and 30 degrees C. Daily consumption rates (g food . g wet weight fish(-1).d(-1).100) of black carp that received prepared feed increased with temperature (small black carp 1.39-1.71; large black carp 1.28-2.10), but temperature-related increases in specific growth rate (100[ln(final weight) - ln(initial weight)]/number of days) only occurred for the large black carp (small black carp -0.02 to 0.19; large black carp 0.16-0.65). Neither daily consumption rates (5.90-6.28) nor specific growth rates (0.05-0.24) differed among temperatures for small black carp fed live snails. The results of these laboratory feeding trials indicate food consumption rates can vary from 289.9 to 349.5 J.g(-1).d(-1) for 150 g black carp receiving prepared feed, from 268.8 to 441.0 J.g(-1).d(-1) for 800 g black carp receiving prepared feed, and from 84.8 to 90.2 J.g(-1).d(-1) for 150 g black carp that feed on snails. Applying estimated daily consumption rates to estimated biomass of native mollusks indicates that a relatively low biomass of black carp could eliminate native snails and substantially reduce recruitment of mussels in time periods as short as 180 d.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1944-687X			WOS:000338436900004

Utilization of Music Therapy in Palliative and Hospice Care An Integrative Review								JOURNAL OF HOSPICE & PALLIATIVE NURSING				16	4			231	239		10.1097/NJH.0000000000000060			JUN 2014	2014	The purpose of this integrative review was to discuss the utilization and effectiveness of music therapy as an adjunct therapy in symptom management for adult patients in palliative care and/or hospice. This review sought to extend empirical knowledge for the use of music as a therapeutic modality by determining which symptoms are most commonly treated with music interventions and how efficacious treatments are. Guided by the Roy Adaptation Model, music is a positive stimulus to improve coping for patients at end of life. An extensive search using CINAHL and the keywords music therapy, hospice, and symptom management was performed for the period of 2006 to 2013. Inclusion criteria were English language, peer reviewed, adult, and use of music as a therapy for symptom management. Exclusion criteria were articles related to program development/evaluation, pediatrics, mechanical injury symptoms, and nonresearch. Seventeen articles were selected for this review. Anxiety and pain were found to be the most commonly addressed symptoms by music therapy, and the interventions decreased the intensity of these symptoms. Limitations included nonrandom sampling and small sample sizes in 6 studies. Most of these studies were of moderate levels of evidence. Implications for advanced practice nurse practice, education, and research are addressed.									4	0	0	1	0	4			1522-2179	1539-0705		WOS:000338204400006

Unlike conventional methods based on viscometers, our microfluidic system employs samples of less than 30 mu l to complete a measurement. Viscosity coefficients of ethanol and fetal bovine serum, as typical examples of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids, were obtained experimentally, and found to be in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. Additionally, a practical application to a DNA solution with incremental ethidium bromide content was employed and the results are consistent with clinical data, indicating that our system provides a potentially important complementary tool for use in such biological and medical applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1054-660X	1555-6611		WOS:000338337500014	27087769	
J	Ballato, John; Dragic, Peter								Materials Development for Next Generation Optical Fiber								MATERIALS				7	6			4411	4430		10.3390/ma7064411			JUN 2014	2014	Optical fibers, the enablers of the Internet, are being used in an ever more diverse array of applications. Many of the rapidly growing deployments of fibers are in high-power and, particularly, high power-per-unit-bandwidth systems where well-known optical nonlinearities have historically not been especially consequential in limiting overall performance. Today, however, nominally weak effects, most notably stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) are among the principal phenomena restricting continued scaling to higher optical power levels. In order to address these limitations, the optical fiber community has focused dominantly on geometry-related solutions such as large mode area (LMA) designs. Since such scattering, and all other linear and nonlinear optical phenomena including higher order mode instability (HOMI), are fundamentally materials-based in origin, this paper unapologetically advocates material solutions to present and future performance limitations. As such, this paper represents a 'call to arms' for material scientists and engineers to engage in this opportunity to drive the future development of optical fibers that address many of the grand engineering challenges of our day.									14	0	0	0	0	14			1996-1944			WOS:000338517300018

Here we present the replication of the Pieris rapae butterfly optical structure. This butterfly has white wings with black spots. The white coloration is produced by light scattering on pterin beads ranging from 100 to 500 nm whereas black spots correspond to areas without pterin beads, thus revealing a highly pigmented layer underneath. In order to mimic the butterfly wing structure, we deposited SU-8 beads produced by electrospraying on a black absorbing layer made of black SU-8. We thereby replicated the optical effect observed on Pieris rapae. Additional experiments showed that the white coloration replication is a structural color. Finally, we further demonstrate that these optical engineered surfaces can be used for sucrose sensing in the range of 1 g/L to 250 g/L.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2072-666X			WOS:000338343700007		
J	Schwindaman, Jeffrey P.; Castle, James W.; Rodgers, John H., Jr.								Biogeochemical Process-Based Design and Performance of a Pilot-Scale Constructed Wetland for Arsenic Removal from Simulated Bangladesh Groundwater								WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION				225	6					2009	10.1007/s11270-014-2009-7			JUN 2014	2014	A pilot-scale constructed wetland treatment system (CWTS) was designed and built to produce bio-geochemical conditions promoting processes targeted for removal of arsenic from simulated Bangladesh ground-water. Two CWTS series were designed to promote coprecipitation and sorption of arsenic with iron oxyhydroxides under oxidizing conditions, and two series were designed to promote precipitation of arsenic sulfide and coprecipitation of arsenic with iron sulfide under reducing conditions. Arsenic removal performance was greater in series with oxidizing conditions than in series with reducing conditions (mean outflow concentrations of 64 and 108 mu g L-1, respectively). Additions of zero-valent iron (ZVI) to oxidizing series and to reducing series enhanced arsenic removal (mean removal efficiencies of 72 and 42%, respectively) compared to unamended series (27 and 20 %, respectively). Arsenic removal performance was significantly greater (alpha=0.05) in the oxidizing series amended with ZVI than in the other series, with removal extents, efficiencies, and rate coefficients ranging from 6 to 79 mu g L-1, 40 to 95 %, and 0.13 to 0.77 day(-1), respectively. Results from this pilot-scale study demonstrate that a CWTS can decrease concentrations of arsenic in arsenic-contaminated water to below the World Health Organization (WHO) drinking water quality guideline of 10 mu g L-1.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0049-6979	1573-2932		WOS:000338334200040

The TE properties of Mg2(Si,Sn) are enhanced via the synergistical implementation of three types of point defects, that is, Sb dopants, Mg vacancies, and Mg interstitials in Mg2Si0.4Sn0.6-xSbx with high Sb content (x > 0.1), and it is found that i) Sb doping at low ratios tunes the carrier concentration while it facilitates the formation of Mg vacancies at high doping ratios (x > 0.1). Mg vacancies act as acceptors and phonon scatters; ii) the concentration of Mg vacancies is effectively controlled by the Sb doping ratio; iii) excess Mg facilitates the formation of Mg interstitials that also tunes the carrier concentration; vi) at the optimal Sb-doping ratio near x approximate to 0.10 the lattice thermal conductivity is significantly reduced, and a state-of-the-art figure of merit ZT > 1.1 is attained at 750 K in 2 at% Zn doped Mg2Si0.4Sn0.5Sb0.1 specimen. These results demonstrate the significance of point defects in thermoelectrics, and the promise of point defect chemistry as a new approach in optimizing TE properties.									34	1	0	1	0	34			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000337953200017

Within-Field Spatial Distribution of Stink Bug (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae)-Induced Boll Injury in Commercial Cotton Fields of the Southeastern United States								ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY				43	3			744	752		10.1603/EN13332			JUN 2014	2014	Spatial distribution of boll injury caused by stink bugs to developing cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) bolls was studied in five commercial fields (approximate to 22 ha each) in 2011 and 2012 to understand variability in boll injury dynamics within fields. Cotton bolls and stink bugs were sampled weekly from a georeferenced grid of sampling points (one sample per 0.40 ha) in each field, but no samples were taken within 30 m of field edges. The inverse distance weighted interpolation, variogram analysis, and MoranOs I were used to describe spatial variability of boll damage within the fields. Boll injury was found to be spatially associated at distances ranging from approximate to 75 to 275 m with an average distance approximate to 150 m. An exponential variogram model was selected as the best fitting model to describe the spatial association in four of the five fields. MoranOs I indicated that spatial association was significant in three of the five fields. The spread of boll injury from stink bugs was gradual in most fields and always exceeded the treatment threshold during the fourth or fifth week of bloom. Capture of stink bugs using a sweep net was inefficient, strongly suggesting that quantifying boll injury is a better sampling method and predictor of stink bug activity when sampling all but the edges of the field. These data suggest that scouts need to sample boll injury from sample locations separated by at least 150 m to assure independence in the central part of large fields. Second, future researchers who plan to use parametric statistical methods could use a 150-m grid, as opposed to a denser grid that would require greater time and effort.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0046-225X	1938-2936		WOS:000337697500023	24735500

RFID and WSNs are well known for their abilities in identity identification and data transmission, respectively, and hence widely used in applications for environmental and health monitoring. Though the integration of a sensor and an RFID tag was proposed to gather both RFID tag and sensed information, few previous research efforts explore the integration of data transmission modes in the RFID and WSN systems to enhance the performance of the applications. In this paper, we propose a hybrid RFID and WSN system (HRW) that synergistically integrates the traditional RFID system and WSN system for efficient data collection. HRW has hybrid smart nodes that combine the function of RFID tags, the reduced function of RFID readers, and wireless sensors. Therefore, nodes can read each other's sensed data in tags, and all data can be quickly transmitted to an RFID reader through the node that first reaches it. The RFID readers transmit the collected data to the back-end servers for data processing and management. We also propose methods to improve data transmission efficiency and to protect data privacy and avoid malicious data selective forwarding in data transmission. Comprehensive simulation and trace-driven experimental results show the high performance of HRW in terms of the cost of deployment, transmission delay and capability, and tag capacity requirement.									5	1	0	0	0	6			1045-9219	1558-2183		WOS:000337966400006

Sterile cultures were initiated on modified Murashige and Skoog medium, and clones from individual donor plants were assigned to experimental conditions when approximately 100 shoots of each clone were available. The effects of temperature, light quality, and plant growth regulators on multiplication and survival were assessed. Four clones from which large greenhouse populations were obtained were selected for in-depth analysis. When shoots were cultured at 10A degrees C and 16A degrees C, multiplication ratios consistently > 1 were observed from three of four clones and two of four clones, respectively, during the five-subculture cycles. None of the clones stably increased when cultured at 24A degrees C, and plants from this treatment did not survive acclimatization in the greenhouse. Only one clone showed increased multiplication ratios in response to plant growth regulator treatments, with maximum multiplication when shoots were cultured with 9 mu M benzyladenine and 0.5 mu M naphthaleneacetic acid. Light quality in the laboratory did not affect multiplication ratio but did affect subsequent greenhouse survival. The size of plants derived from culture was most often equivalent (65% of 1,271) to 3-yr-old seed-derived plants. Although the growth of clones during acclimatization differed, plants derived from cultures incubated at 16A degrees C had the best rates of overall greenhouse survival. Temperature and light treatments in vitro critical to long-term plant survival were demonstrated and will assist the establishment of a mass propagation system for V. californicum.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1054-5476	1475-2689		WOS:000337159600005

To date, agarose molds have been extensively used to facilitate fusion process of tissue spheroids. As a molding material, agarose typically requires low temperature plates for gelation and/or heated dispenser units. Here, we proposed and developed an alginate-based, direct 3D mold-printing technology: 3D printing microdroplets of alginate solution into biocompatible, bio-inert alginate hydrogel molds for the fabrication of scaffold-free tissue engineering constructs. Specifically, we developed a 3D printing technology to deposit microdroplets of alginate solution on calcium containing substrates in a layer-by-layer fashion to prepare ring-shaped 3D hydrogel molds. Tissue spheroids composed of 50% endothelial cells and 50% smooth muscle cells were robotically placed into the 3D printed alginate molds using a 3D printer, and were found to rapidly fuse into toroid-shaped tissue units. Histological and immunofluorescence analysis indicated that the cells secreted collagen type I playing a critical role in promoting cell-cell adhesion, tissue formation and maturation.									15	0	0	7	0	15			1758-5082	1758-5090		WOS:000337705000013	24717646

As overt forms of resistance are often not feasible in situations where nurses occupy subordinate positions to their bullies, I propose that cognitive reappraisal can be an effective coping strategy, and situate this perspective within the research on humour, hope and optimism.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1322-7114	1440-172X		WOS:000337544800008	24889001

Effect of the endosymbiotic pea crab Calyptraeotheres garthi on the metabolic rate and oxidative status of the slipper limpet Crepidula cachimilla								INVERTEBRATE BIOLOGY				133	2			170	179		10.1111/ivb.12050			JUN 2014	2014	Parasites may induce metabolic changes and imbalances in the redox status of hosts. This study tested the effect of parasites on the O2 consumption rate (O2-CR) of hosts, and explored the link between O2-CR and oxidative stress in parasitized hosts. We used the symbiotic pea crab Calyptraeotheres garthi and its slipper limpet host Crepidula cachimilla as models. The O2-CR of long-term (3months) infested limpets was 2.5 times greater than that of long-term uninfested limpets. Also, the O2-CR of limpets stripped of crabs 24h before measurements was intermediate between that of long-term infested and uninfested limpets. These results indicate a parasitic relationship between C. garthi and Cr. cachimilla, and suggest that the effect of the parasite on the metabolic rate of limpets is reversible. Lastly, the activity of two antioxidant enzymes (CAT and GST) as well as lipid peroxidation did not vary between infested and uninfested limpets. Thus, increased O2-CR is not necessarily coupled with oxidative stress in pea crab-parasitized slipper limpets.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1077-8306	1744-7410		WOS:000337532900007

Surprisingly, prior research has not investigated the factors that affect this fundamentally important career decision. We conduct two surveys to investigate the relevant factors of the audit-tax decision from the perspectives of upper-division accounting students and experienced public accounting professionals. Our student survey documents the underlying factors that influence the audit-tax decision. For example, accounting students who plan to pursue careers in audit believe that they will have more client interaction, better future job opportunities (i.e., industry positions), and greater knowledge of business processes if they work in audit (as opposed to tax). In contrast, accounting students who plan to pursue careers in tax perceive that they will have a more stable daily routine, develop more specialized skills, and build more collaborative client relationships if they work in tax (as opposed to audit). While our public accounting respondents agree with many of the students' perceptions, professionals also disagree with several of the students' perceptions, suggesting misimpressions of practice. Our results should be of interest to the accounting professionals, firm recruiters, and accounting professors who advise future accounting professionals.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0888-7993	1558-7975		WOS:000337182000001

Frizzled10 mediates WNT1 and WNT3A signaling in the dorsal spinal cord of the developing chick embryo								DEVELOPMENTAL DYNAMICS				243	6			833	843		10.1002/dvdy.24123			JUN 2014	2014	Background: WNT1 and WNT3A drive a dorsal to ventral gradient of -catenin-dependent Wnt signaling in the developing spinal cord. However, the identity of the receptors mediating downstream functions remains poorly understood. Results: In this report, we show that the spatiotemporal expression patterns of FZD10 and WNT1/WNT3A are highly correlated. We further show that in the presence of LRP6, FZD10 promotes WNT1 and WNT3A signaling using an 8xSuperTopFlash reporter assay. Consistent with a functional role for FZD10, we demonstrate that FZD10 is required for proliferation in the spinal cord. Finally, by using an in situ proximity ligation assay, we observe an interaction between FZD10 and WNT1 and WNT3A proteins. Conclusions: Together, our results identify FZD10 as a receptor for WNT1 and WNT3A in the developing chick spinal cord. Developmental Dynamics 243:833-843, 2014.

J	Chen, Xing; Chen, Fangyuan; Huang, Kama; Xu, Xiao-Bang								A Fast Algorithm to Simulate 2-D Electromagnetic Field for Objects With Gradually Time-Varying Dielectric Permittivity								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES				62	6			1284	1290		10.1109/TMTT.2014.2321343			JUN 2014	2014	In some cases such as heating objects by microwave power, variation of the temperature in objects changes their dielectric permittivity and then leads to variation of the electromagnetic (EM) field. The commonly adopted method of simulation for the heating procedure is to repeatedly execute the full-wave simulation for each small time intervals, which results in a heavy computation burden. A fast algorithm for simulating 2-D sceneries is proposed for the first time. It starts with a full-wave simulation to get an initial EM field, and then corrects the EM field in an efficient way rather than repeating the full-wave simulation when the object's permittivity has slightly changed. A few sample numerical results are presented and analyzed, which verifies the accuracy, robustness, and effectiveness of the proposed fast algorithm.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0018-9480	1557-9670		WOS:000337122800003

After LASIK, riboflavin 0.1% was instilled in the residual stromal bed for 60 seconds. After the riboflavin was washed out and the flap placed in its original position, ultraviolet-A light (30 mW/cm(2)) was administered for 60 seconds. The LASIK CXL eyes and the LASIK-only eyes were compared. The uncorrected (UDVA) and corrected (CDVA) distance visual acuities, manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE), keratometry values, endothelial cell density (ECD), pachymetry, optical coherence tomography (OCT), corneal hysteresis (CH), corneal resistance factor (CRF), keratoconus match index (KMI), and 37 parameters from a dynamic bidirectional applanation device (Ocular Response Analyzer) were analyzed. Morphologic changes were evaluated using confocal microscopy.RESULTS: No significant differences in UDVA, CDVA, MRSE, ECD, dynamic bidirectional applanation readings (eg, CH, CRF, KMI), or 37 additional parameters were found between the 2 groups (P>.05). Increased hyperreflectivity and a demarcation line similar to that seen after CXL were observed in the LASIK-CXL eyes. The demarcation line (mean depth 200.04 mu m +/- 27.01 [SD]; range 178 to 278 gm) was present in 23 eyes (95.8%); the line was well defined in 2 eyes (8.3%) and faint in 21 eyes (87.5%).CONCLUSION: Combined LASIK CXL was safe, causing insignificant corneal biomechanical and morphologic changes similar to those with CXL treatment only.

This corresponds to a total radiant exposure of 5.4 J/cm(2). Preoperative and 1, 3, and 6 months postoperative examinations were performed.RESULTS: The study enrolled 39 eyes of 22 patients. The mean uncorrected distance visual acuity showed a statistically significant improvement, from 1.11 +/- 0.42 logMAR preoperatively to 0.89 +/- 0.53 logMAR 6 months postoperatively (P<.01). The mean maximum keratometry readings also changed significantly, from 49.95 +/- 6.11 diopters (D) preoperatively to 49.19 +/- 5.82 D at 6 months (P<.01). There were no statistically significant changes in the endothelial cell density between preoperatively and postoperatively.CONCLUSIONS: The changes after accelerated CXL were similar to those after conventional CXL. Thus, accelerated CXL has the potential to efficiently treat and halt the progression of keratoconus and may be an effective, efficient therapeutic option for treating corneal ectatic disease.

Durability of a Novel Durable Bait for Control of Subterranean Termites (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae): Results of Five-Year Field Aging Studies								JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY				107	3			1201	1205		10.1603/EC13382			JUN 2014	2014	A durable termite bait containing 0.5% noviflumuron was evaluated for physical durability, retention of active ingredient, consumption by termites, and toxicity to termites over 5 yr in field studies at locations in Indiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina. Plots in Indiana and Mississippi included both natural rainfall and irrigated plots, while plots in South Carolina received only natural rainfall. Samples collected every 3 mo for the first 4 yr were evaluated for consumption with a 7d no-choice bioassay using Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar). Consumption and toxicity of 5 yr samples were evaluated in similar bioassays conducted for 42d. Durable baits received from field sites had some cracking, and a small amount of external flaking, but no major deterioration based on visual observation. There were no significant differences in noviflumuron concentration over the 5-yr period and no trend toward reduced concentrations of noviflumuron over time. Consumption of aged durable baits over 4 yr was variable, but termites usually consumed more aged durable bait than fresh durable bait and the differences were frequently significant. There were some exceptions, but termites consumed significantly more fresh durable bait than aged durable bait in only 4% of observations. When 5 yr samples were evaluated, consumption was lowest for fresh durable bait and termites consumed significantly more aged durable bait from irrigated plots in Indiana and from both natural and irrigated plots in Mississippi than fresh durable bait. Survival of termites fed blank durable bait was significantly higher than that for termites fed any of the baits containing noviflumuron and there were no significant differences in survival among the noviflumuron durable baits. Our results suggest that the bait would be durable for at least 5 yr and possibly longer under most environmental conditions.									6	0	0	5	1	6			0022-0493	1938-291X		WOS:000337174300040	25026683

Preparing for Patient-Centered Care: Assessing Nursing Student Knowledge, Comfort, and Cultural Competence Toward the Latino Population								JOURNAL OF NURSING EDUCATION				53	6			305	312		10.3928/01484834-20140428-01			JUN 2014	2014	As the Latino population continues to grow throughout the United States, cultural competence training of nursing students at the baccalaureate level has become a priority. This study aimed to explore undergraduate nursing students' attitudes and beliefs toward Latino patients and their perceived readiness to provide care to Latino patients. A cross-sectional survey was conducted at four major nursing schools in the southeastern United States, which is the region that has seen the highest percentage of growth in the Latino population. Results from multivariable regression suggest that social interaction with Latino individuals and cultural immersion in a Spanish-speaking country predict student knowledge, cultural competence, and comfort with Latino patients. Direct influence by nursing programs, such as clinical experience, coursework, and language proficiency, are positively associated with the designed outcomes, but these relationships are not statistically significant. Our findings suggest that dosage of training matters. Implications for student recruitment, selection, and training are discussed.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0148-4834	1938-2421		WOS:000337165000002	24766083

This study proposes that users' trust in the system may influence their satisfaction and continuance intention. While trust has been found to have strategic implications for understanding consumers' technology usage, relatively little research has examined how trust's influence operates over time. To gain insight into trust's influence on strategic system usage over time and to explain how trust relates to satisfaction and continuance intention, we integrate trust-related constructs with the Complete Expectation Disconfirmation Theory (EDT) Model. Our results demonstrate that trust plays a central role in the EDT process and that the EDT process helps explain trust's role more completely. The study shows that technology trusting expectations influence trusting intention through performance, disconfirmation, and satisfaction. We also show that technology trusting intention adds predictive power to EDT's satisfaction construct as together they predict usage continuance intention. For research, our results provide a strong combined EDT and trust theory base for future studies that examine expectation management and system development projects. For practice, our study informs systems implementation strategies for technologies that have fewer human-like characteristics and more technology-like characteristics. Our findings underscore that managers need to adopt an EDT process-based view when seeking to build trust, satisfaction, and continuance intention in strategically important information systems.

J	Campbell, Alan O.; Pagano, Christopher C.								The effect of instructions on potential slide-out failures during portable extension ladder angular positioning								ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION				67				30	39		10.1016/j.aap.2014.01.025			JUN 2014	2014	Accidents involving portable ladders are a common cause of serious occupational and non-occupational injuries throughout the industrialized world. Many of these injuries could be prevented with better instruction on the proper usage of portable ladders. Research is reported that focused on both the human factors and engineering aspects of portable extension ladder usage based on common ladder setup procedures. Results of the human factors experiment revealed evidence of unsafe acts that could lead to catastrophic ladder slide-out accidents in real-life situations. Six different ladder setup methods were evaluated for safety and stability based on placement angles: the basic, 75 degree, stand-reach, L sticker, 4:1, and bubble level methods. Ideally, ladder users would set the ladder up at 75.5 degrees to achieve the consensus industry standard safest angle. Setup methods varied in complexity and nature of instruction. The level method produced the most accurate and the least variable results. The engineering analysis determined the coefficient of friction of a variety of clean and contaminated surfaces commonly used with ladders. This analysis determined the total number of slide-out failures that would likely have occurred in the data obtained in each of the ladder setup methods tested in the human factors experiment. Based on test participants' setup angles, the average calculated ladder slide-out failure rate was 8.7 percent for ladders positioned on a surface with the lowest measured coefficient of friction. When broken down by ladder setup method, the 4:1 method had a failure rate of 18.8 percent, the 75 degree method had a failure rate of 15.2 percent, and the basic method had a failure rate of 9.8 percent. The stand-reach and L sticker methods had identical failure rates at 3.3 percent and the level method was best at 1.1 percent. The level method provided the lowest error, least variability, and setup closest to the target angle of 75.5 degrees. Analysis of the overall results revealed the need for additional user training and clearer instructions affixed to ladders. This research is unique in that it combines an analysis and comparison of human factors and engineering in the same study. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Density functional theory calculations coupled to microkinetic models identify mixed Cu-Co alloy sites, at Co-enriched surfaces, as ideal for the selective production of long-chain alcohols. Accordingly, a versatile synthesis route is developed based on metal nanoparticle exsolution from a molybdate precursor compound whose crystalline structure isomorphically accommodates Cu2+ and Co2+ cations in a wide range of compositions. As revealed by energy-dispersive X-ray nanospectroscopy and temperaturere-solved X-ray diffraction, superior mixing of Cu and Co species promotes formation of CuCo alloy nanocrystals after activation, leading to two orders of magnitude higher yield to high alcohols than a benchmark CuCoCr catalyst. Substantiating simulations, the yield to high alcohols is maximized in parallel to the CuCo alloy contribution, for Co-rich surface compositions, for which Cu phase segregation is prevented.									45	2	0	3	0	47			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000337095900012	24827541

Using a 2 x 3 x 2 between-subjects experimental design, this research explored the relationship between friend adding (add; no add), levels of self-disclosure (low, medium, high), and sex of the Facebook profile owner (male; female) on feelings of interpersonal liking, future behavioral intentions to interact, and homophily. Results indicated that friend adding and higher levels of self-disclosure led to greater feelings of interpersonal liking and homophily amongst both male and female participants. In addition, males tended to view other male profiles with moderate amounts of disclosure and female profiles with the highest amount of disclosure most favorably. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									1	1	0	0	0	2			0747-5632	1873-7692		WOS:000336878600053		
J	Plumblee, Jeff; Klotz, Leidy								Marlo's windows: why it is a mistake to ignore hazard resistance in LCA								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT				19	6			1173	1178		10.1007/s11367-014-0741-2			JUN 2014	2014	Hazard-resistant materials for homes promise environmental benefits, such as avoided waste and materials for repairs, which can be overlooked by scoping in life-cycle assessment (LCA) approaches. Our motivation for pursuing this research was to see how incorporating these avoided losses in the LCA could impact choices between hazard-resistant and traditional materials.Two choices common in home construction were analyzed using an LCA process that incorporates catastrophe modeling to consider avoided losses made possible with hazard-resistant materials. These findings were compared to those based on a similar LCA that did not consider these avoided losses. The choices considered were standard windows vs. windows with impact-resistant glass and standard windows with no opening protection vs. standard windows with impact-resistant storm panels.For the window comparisons, the standard products were environmentally preferable when avoided losses from storm events were not considered in the LCA. However, when avoided losses were considered, the hazard-resistant products were environmentally preferable. Considering avoided losses in LCAs, as illustrated by the window choices, can change which product appears to be the environmentally preferable option. Further, as home service life increases, the environmental net benefit of the hazard-resistant product increases.Our results show the value of an LCA approach which allows more complete scopings of comparisons between hazard-resistant materials and their traditional counterparts. This approach will help translate the impacts of hazard-resistant products into the more familiar language used to talk about "green" products, enabling more informed decisions by product manufacturers, those who develop building certification systems and codes, researchers, and other building industry stakeholders.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0948-3349	1614-7502		WOS:000337062400001

While most scientists concur that this region has warmed on aggregate, there is no a priori reason to believe that temporal trends in extremes and averages will exhibit the same patterns. Indeed, under minor regularity conditions, the sample partial sum and maximum of stationary time series are asymptotically independent (statistically). Previous authors have suggested that minimum temperatures are warming faster than maximum temperatures in the United States; such an aspect can be investigated via the methods discussed in this study. Here, statistical models with extreme value and changepoint features are used to estimate trends and their standard errors. A spatial smoothing is then done to extract general structure. The results show that monthly maximum temperatures are not often greatly changing-perhaps surprisingly, there are many stations that show some cooling. In contrast, the minimum temperatures show significant warming. Overall, the southeastern United States shows the least warming (even some cooling), and the western United States, northern Midwest, and New England have experienced the most warming.									7	0	0	2	0	8			0894-8755	1520-0442		WOS:000336889300020

A C. jejuni-specific primer set targeting a portion of the C. jejuni hippuricase gene was developed. The specificity of the newly designed primer pair was verified using 5 C. jejuni strains and 20 other bacterial strains. Sensitivity was determined to be as low as 1 genome copy per reaction. A total of 73 samples were collected at different sites along the processing line during 2 visits to a poultry slaughterhouse and were examined by direct plating onto modified charcoal cefoperazone deoxycholate agar or after enrichment in Bolton broth followed by plating on modified charcoal cefoperazone deoxycholate agar. The newly developed real-time PCR assay was used to identify the presumptive colonies as belonging to C. jejuni. A real-time PCR assay targeting 16S ribosomal RNA was also applied to determine Campylobacter spp. prevalence. Results from the real-time PCR analysis indicated considerable variability in Campylobacter contamination, with incidence rates of 72.7 and 27.6% for sampling days A and B, respectively. Campylobacter was isolated from 100% of prescalded and preeviscerated carcasses on sampling day A. In contrast, on sampling day B, the highest number of Campylobacter-positive carcasses was recovered after evisceration (60%). The chilling process significantly reduced (P < 0.05) Campylobacter population, but the percentage of positive samples on sampling day A increased to 80%. All samples collected from the processing environment, except scalding tank 3 and the prechiller and chiller tanks, were 100% positive on day A, whereas no campylobacters were isolated from machinery on sampling day B. Our results revealed the widespread of C. jejuni in poultry processing and proved that the newly developed real-time PCR assay is a simple, specific, and inexpensive method for rapid C. jejuni identification. The newly developed PCR method can be easily used in laboratories for reliable and unambiguous identification of C. jejuni in poultry samples.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0032-5791	1525-3171		WOS:000337078000030	24879709

Three groups were observed within this sample of 435 rape victims from a national telephone household probability sample of women: those who did not consult with anyone about reporting (n = 364), those who consulted with someone and were encouraged to report to police (n = 40), and those who consulted with someone and were not encouraged to report (n = 31). Descriptive analyses indicated that the encouraged group was more likely to report to police than either of the other two groups (which did not differ from each other). Because there were no differences between the two consulting groups on demographic or rape-related variables, they were combined in subsequent analyses. Consulting with others about whether to report, peri-traumatic fear of injury or death, assault perpetration by a stranger, and concerns about contracting a sexually transmitted disease were significant predictors of reporting to police after controlling for other significant predictors in a multivariate regression analysis. Implications of these findings are discussed, including the benefits and consequences of formal rape reporting for victims, and the role that disclosure recipients may have in assisting victims postrape (e.g., encouragement of reporting, emotional support).									8	0	0	0	0	8			0361-6843	1471-6402		WOS:000337058700006	25431519

Previous work estimating the iodine sorption has not allowed for samples to reach full equilibrium and field studies have reported significant fractions of up to three major species of iodine; therefore, further research into the kinetics of iodine sorption to sediments is warranted. The objective of this study is to investigate the kinetics of iodine sorption in the presence of subsurface upland sediments and wetland sediments from an area within an I-129 plume at the Savannah River Site in Aiken, SC. Batch sorption studies for these systems took longer than 8 weeks to reach equilibrium, which is significant as previous studies did not reach such timescales. In addition, experiments were conducted under oxic and anoxic conditions. Results confirm that there are three species present in these systems (iodide, iodate, and organo-iodine) with a majority as organo-iodine species at equilibrium for systems with high organic matter content. It is notable that the anoxic conditions exhibited reduced sorption for the iodate species to wetland sediment with high organic matter. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Caruso, Nicholas M.; Sears, Michael W.; Adams, Dean C.; Lips, Karen R.					Lips, Karen/0000-0002-2719-1551			Widespread rapid reductions in body size of adult salamanders in response to climate change								GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY				20	6			1751	1759		10.1111/gcb.12550			JUN 2014	2014	Reduction in body size is a major response to climate change, yet evidence in globally imperiled amphibians is lacking. Shifts in average population body size could indicate either plasticity in the growth response to changing climates through changes in allocation and energetics, or through selection for decreased size where energy is limiting. We compared historic and contemporary size measurements in 15 Plethodon species from 102 populations (9450 individuals) and found that six species exhibited significant reductions in body size over 55years. Biophysical models, accounting for actual changes in moisture and air temperature over that period, showed a 7.1-7.9% increase in metabolic expenditure at three latitudes but showed no change in annual duration of activity. Reduced size was greatest at southern latitudes in regions experiencing the greatest drying and warming. Our results are consistent with a plastic response of body size to climate change through reductions in body size as mediated through increased metabolism. These rapid reductions in body size over the past few decades have significance for the susceptibility of amphibians to environmental change, and relevance for whether adaptation can keep pace with climate change in the future.									34	0	0	30	0	35			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000336482700005	24664864	
J	Shen, Haiying; Li, Ze; Li, Ting								Token list based information search in a multi-dimensional massive database								JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS				42	3			567	594		10.1007/s10844-013-0289-9			JUN 2014	2014	Finding proximity information is crucial for massive database search. Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) is a method for finding nearest neighbors of a query point in a high-dimensional space. It classifies high-dimensional data according to data similarity. However, the "curse of dimensionality" makes LSH insufficiently effective in finding similar data and insufficiently efficient in terms of memory resources and search delays. The contribution of this work is threefold. First, we study a Token List based information Search scheme (TLS) as an alternative to LSH. TLS builds a token list table containing all the unique tokens from the database, and clusters data records having the same token together in one group. Querying is conducted in a small number of groups of relevant data records instead of searching the entire database. Second, in order to decrease the searching time of the token list, we further propose the Optimized Token list based Search schemes (OTS) based on index-tree and hash table structures. An index-tree structure orders the tokens in the token list and constructs an index table based on the tokens. Searching the token list starts from the entry of the token list supplied by the index table. A hash table structure assigns a hash ID to each token. A query token can be directly located in the token list according to its hash ID. Third, since a single-token based method leads to high overhead in the results refinement given a required similarity, we further investigate how a Multi-Token List Search scheme (MTLS) improves the performance of database proximity search. We conducted experiments on the LSH-based searching scheme, TLS, OTS, and MTLS using a massive customer data integration database. The comparison experimental results show that TLS is more efficient than an LSH-based searching scheme, and OTS improves the search efficiency of TLS. Further, MTLS per forms better than TLS when the number of tokens is appropriately chosen, and a two-token adjacent token list achieves the shortest query delay in our testing dataset.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0925-9902	1573-7675		WOS:000336277700010

A physical example of the emerging genre of "architectural robotics," AWE features a programmable, reconfigurable "wall," three horizontal, mobile work-surfaces, and embedded information technologies. AWE is the result of an iterative design process involving surveys, task analyses, virtual and physical prototyping, and usability testing accomplished by a transdisciplinary team of engineers, architects, sociologists, and human factors psychologists. Usability testing has demonstrated AWE's potential to enhance working life: AWE adapts to variations in complex activities involving users working in one physical place with physical and digital tools and artifacts.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1617-4909	1617-4917		WOS:000336404300015

Traditional rear lighting research has not used the visual search paradigm in experimental design. It is our claim that the visual search design uniquely uncovers visual attention processes operating when drivers search the visual field that current designs fail to capture. This experiment is a validation and extension of previous simulator research on this same topic and demonstrates that detection of red automobile brake lamps will be improved if tail lamps are another color (in this test, amber) rather than the currently mandated red. Results indicate that when drivers miss brake lamp onset in low ambient light, RT and error are reduced in detecting the presence and absence of red brake lamps with multiple lead vehicles when tail lamps are not red compared to current rear lighting which mandates red tail lamps. This performance improvement is attributed to efficient visual processing that automatically segregates tail (amber) and brake (red) lamp colors into distractors and targets respectively.

However, the potential of this method for the study of adsorbed protein structure is largely undeveloped at this time. The objective of this research was therefore to extend these capabilities by developing and applying AAL/MS techniques for a range of amino acid types to identify the dominant configurations of an adsorbed protein on a material surface. In this study, the configuration of hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL) adsorbed on fused silica glass, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) was mapped by combining the labeling profiles obtained from five amino acid labels, which were independently applied. In order to be able to combine the results from the different amino acid labeling processes, the intensity of the HEWL segment without the target amino acids was used as an internal control to normalize the intensity shifts to an equivalent level. The resulting quantitative differences in the normalized amino acid profiles were then used to provide insights into adsorbed orientation, protein-protein interactions and adsorption-induced tertiary unfolding of HEWL, which were found to be distinctly different between the fused silica glass, HDPE and PMMA surfaces. The developed technique has the potential for broad application and for expansion to additional targeted amino acids to provide highly detailed information on the adsorbed state of any protein on any given surface.

J	Bisesi, Joseph H., Jr.; Bridges, William; Klaine, Stephen J.								Reprint of: Effects of the antidepressant venlafaxine on fish brain serotonin and predation behavior								AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY				151		SI		88	96		10.1016/j.aquatox.2014.02.015			JUN 2014	2014	Antidepressants that enter receiving waters through final treated wastewater effluent have exhibited relatively low acute toxicity in traditional fish tests at currently measured concentrations. However, the psychotropic mode of action of these compounds warrants examination of the behavioral effects these chemicals may have on aquatic organisms. Previous research has demonstrated that exposure to the antidepressant fluoxetine causes decreased brain serotonin levels in fish and results in a decreased ability to capture prey. Another antidepressant, venlafaxine, has been found at low mu g/L concentrations in final treated wastewater effluent. The objective of this study was to quantify the effects of venlafaxine on fish predation behavior and determine if this effect was correlated with changes in brain neurotransmitter concentrations. The predator prey bioassay used hybrid striped bass (Morone saxatilis x Morone chrysops) as the predator and fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) as prey. Bass were exposed to venlafaxine (0-500 mu g/L) for a period of 6 days and then allowed to recover for 6 days. During both exposure and recovery, bass were fed four minnows every third day. The time to capture the minnows was quantified and compared among treatments to determine if there was an effect on predation behavior. Brain tissue was analyzed for serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, to determine the relationship between exposure concentration, brain monoamine levels, and predation behavior. Results indicated that venlafaxine exposures increased time to capture prey 1 and 2 by day 6 for the 250 and 500 mu g/L treatments. Time to capture prey 3 was increased for all venlafaxine treatments by day 6. Venlafaxine caused a statistically significant decrease in brain serotonin concentrations that initially decreased in a dose dependent manner before reaching a steady state by the end of exposures for all treatments. No significant, dose-dependent changes in dopamine or norepinephrine were seen. Brain serotonin alone did not adequately explain behavioral results. Serotonin response in other tissues as well as peripheral effects may have accounted for additional behavioral responses after brain serotonin reached a depressed steady state. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Nineteen high-, 48 average-, and 17 low-achieving students participated in this study. All participants were asked to complete three different multiplication tests and to explain how they solved these problems. Results suggested that low achievers used incorrect operation strategies more frequently, indicating a lack of conceptual understanding of multiplication. High-achieving students demonstrated greater flexibility in problem-solving and were more accurate in performing direct retrieval or math algorithm strategies. Results were discussed about improving low achievers' use of advanced strategies, enhancing their flexibility in choosing strategies and improving students' accuracy in using direct retrieval or math algorithms.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0256-2928	1878-5174		WOS:000336400200002

The presence of plant cell wall degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) in the beetle's digestive tract makes this degradation possible. Sequences encoding these beetle-derived PCWDEs were originally identified from transcriptomes and strikingly resemble those of saprophytic and phytopathogenic microorganisms, raising questions about their origin; e.g. are they insect- or microorganism-derived? To demonstrate unambiguously that the genes encoding PCWDEs found in beetle transcriptomes are indeed of insect origin, we generated a bacterial artificial chromosome library from the genome of the leaf beetle Chrysomela tremula, containing 18432 clones with an average size of 143kb. After hybridizing this library with probes derived from 12 C.tremulaPCWDE-encoding genes and sequencing the positive clones, we demonstrated that the latter genes are encoded by the insect's genome and are surrounded by genes possessing orthologues in the genome of Tribolium castaneum as well as in three other beetle genomes. Our analyses showed that although the level of overall synteny between C.tremula and T.castaneum seems high, the degree of microsynteny between both species is relatively low, in contrast to the more closely related Colorado potato beetle.									5	0	0	5	0	5			0962-1075	1365-2583		WOS:000335577400002	24456018

A novel, multiobjective stochastic mixed-integer programming model is developed to establish a biofuel infrastructure system that is effective and resilient in hedging against potential hazards through integrating four dimensions of resilience, as follows: (1)robustness, (2)rapidity, (3)redundancy, and (4)resourcefulness. As a case study, the model is used to evaluate the infrastructure requirements for cellulosic ethanol production from biomass wastes in California, which is prone to seismic hazards. An average of 19% overall system cost reduction can be achieved under seismic hazards by using the developed model over common engineering methods without resilience consideration.

The characterization of porous pavement behavior presented is appropriate for initial pavement design purposes. During any given storm, there are four distinct phases of porous pavement behavior: infiltration, accumulation, runoff, and drawdown. Analytical and graphical methods are presented for describing each of these phases from which a nonconvoluted approximate runoff hydrograph can be derived. This approach approximates peak runoff and time of that peak for a given storm depth, rainfall distribution, and pavement design. Second, a generalized method for calculating a porous pavement's effective curve number (ECN) based on the National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) [formerly Soil Conservation Service (SCS)] runoff curve number is presented. The analysis shows that for undrained porous pavements, the ECN is a function not only of the pavement and soil properties, but also of the storm depths and hyetographs used in the analysis. A standard calculation and presentation method is suggested that will allow local regions or municipalities to generate a local ECN design tool appropriate for their intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) data, which are only a function of the effective storage depth and the daily effective soil infiltration depth. A plot of the maximum ECN for all pavement depths and soil types is presented for each NRCS storm type as a reference for generating local ECN figures.									7	0	0	1	0	7			1084-0699	1943-5584		WOS:000336254900003

This can be achieved through a combination of experimental and numerical studies to gain insights on the macrolevel strength-deformation behavior and microlevel defects and crack growth of masonry structures. Although experiments aid in calibration and validation of the numerical model to reduce errors and uncertainties in predictions, the success of the simulations fundamentally depends on the accuracy of the mechanical principles used to represent the heterogeneous masonry assembly. In this paper, three modeling techniquesdetailed micromodeling, simplified micromodeling, and macromodelingare investigated, considering not only the accuracy but also the robustness of the model predictions. In detailed micromodeling, the brick units and mortar joints are modeled as separate entities. In simplified micromodeling, the bricks and mortar are smeared, homogenized units bonded with zero-thickness interface elements. In macromodeling, the masonry composites are smeared into a homogenous continuum. Linear properties of these three alternative models are first calibrated by exploiting the modal parameters identified through dynamic experiments conducted on a scaled dome specimen in the laboratory. The fidelity of the two micromodeling and the macromodeling techniques are then evaluated by comparing the model predictions against static, load-to-failure tests conducted on the same scaled masonry dome. Finally, the robustness of the three models to uncertainty in the input parameters is evaluated.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0887-3828	1943-5509		WOS:000336246800007

Effects of elevated CO2 on the extractable amino acids of leaf litter and fine roots								NEW PHYTOLOGIST				202	4			1257	1265		10.1111/nph.12762			JUN 2014	2014	<list list-type="bulleted" id="nph12762-list-0001"> Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations can change chemistry and input rate of plant tissue to soil, potentially influencing above- and below-ground biogeochemical cycles. Given the important role played by leaf and root litter chemistry in controlling ecosystem function and vulnerability to environmental stresses, we investigated the hydrolyzable amino acid distribution and concentration in leaf and fine root litter among control and elevated CO2 treatments at the Rhinelander free air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment (WI, USA). We extracted hydrolyzable amino acids from leaf litter and fine (<2mm) roots at three depths for both control and elevated CO2 plots. We found that elevated CO2 decreased the proportion of total leaf amino acid carbon (C), but had no effect on total leaf amino acid nitrogen (N). There was no treatment effect for total root amino acid N or amino acid C for any depth. The decrease in leaf amino acids is probably a result of the shift of protein compounds to more structural compounds. Despite the decrease in leaf amino acid C concentrations, the overall increase in annual plant production under elevated CO2 would result in an increase in plant amino acids to the soil.									4	0	0	3	0	4			0028-646X	1469-8137		WOS:000335470200017	24635834

Alex								Systems genetics: A paradigm to improve discovery of candidate genes and mechanisms underlying complex traits								PLANT SCIENCE				223				45	48		10.1016/j.plantsci.2014.03.003			JUN 2014	2014	Understanding the control of any trait optimally requires the detection of causal genes, gene interaction, and mechanism of action to discover and model the biochemical pathways underlying the expressed phenotype. Functional genomics techniques, including RNA expression profiling via microarray and high-throughput DNA sequencing, allow for the precise genome localization of biological information. Powerful genetic approaches, including quantitative trait locus (QTL) and genome-wide association study mapping, link phenotype with genome positions, yet genetics is less precise in localizing the relevant mechanistic information encoded in DNA. The coupling of salient functional genomic signals with genetically mapped positions is an appealing approach to discover meaningful gene phenotype relationships. Techniques used to define this genetic genomic convergence comprise the field of systems genetics. This short review will address an application of systems genetics where RNA profiles are associated with genetically mapped genome positions of individual genes (eQTL mapping) or as gene sets (co-expression network modules). Both approaches can be applied for knowledge independent selection of candidate genes (and possible control mechanisms) underlying complex traits where multiple, likely unlinked, genomic regions might control specific complex traits.

In order to investigate defense mechanisms of Populus in response to S. musiva, differential gene expression in leaf tissues of two resistant (DN34, P. deltoides x nigra; NM6, P. nigra x maximowiczii) and two susceptible clones (DN164, P. deltoides x nigra; NC11505, P. maximowiczii x trichocarpa) was analyzed by RNA-Seq. Of the 511 million reads obtained, 78% and 0.01% were successfully aligned to the genomes of P. trichocarpa and S. musiva, respectively. Functional annotation of differentially expressed genes based on comparisons between resistant and susceptible clones revealed that there were significant differences in the expression of genes involved in disease/stress resistance and oxidation-reduction in mock-inoculated leaves. Four days post inoculation with S. musiva, 36 differentially expressed genes were found to be regulated in the same direction in both resistant clones. The 22 up-regulated loci in resistant clones included genes involved in protein fate, cell wall structure, and responsiveness to various biotic and abiotic stresses. In particular, Potri.008G187100 locus encodes a putative multi antimicrobial extrusion protein and Potri.006G272600 encodes a family1 glycosyltransferase required for pathogen resistance. The differentially expressed loci with increased expression in the susceptible clones corresponded to NB-ARC domain-containing disease resistance protein, phospholipase A 2A, MutT/nudix family protein, and an elicitor-activated gene 3-1 product. The results from this study indicate that strong defense mechanisms involved in oxidation-reduction, protein fate, secondary metabolism, and accumulation of defense-related gene products may contribute to Septoria resistance in DN34 and NM6, while increased expression of hypersensitive response-loci, particularly those encoding NB-ARC domain-containing disease resistance proteins, may contribute to the susceptibility of DN164 and NC11505 through interaction with pathogen effectors.

In a sample of 150,000 contracts from 85 procurement offices over 11 years, increases in workload decrease reliance on competitive acquisition procedures, decrease reliance on firm-fixed-price contracts, increase risk of renegotiation, and increase costs. These estimates are consistent with a model of endogenously incomplete contracting.

Estimation of hand hygiene opportunities on an adult medical ward using 24-hour camera surveillance: Validation of the HOW2 Benchmark Study								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF INFECTION CONTROL				42	6			602	607		10.1016/j.ajic.2014.02.020			JUN 2014	2014	Background: We previously published a formula to estimate the number of hand hygiene opportunities (HHOs) per patient-day using the World Health Organization's "Five Moments for Hand Hygiene" methodology (HOW2 Benchmark Study). HHOs can be used as a denominator for calculating hand hygiene compliance rates when product utilization data are available. This study validates the previously derived HHO estimate using 24-hour video surveillance of health care worker hand hygiene activity.Methods: The validation study utilized 24-hour video surveillance recordings of 26 patients' hospital stays to measure the actual number of HHOs per patient-day on a medicine ward in a large teaching hospital. Statistical methods were used to compare these results to those obtained by episodic observation of patient activity in the original derivation study.Results: Total hours of data collection were 81.3 and 1,510.8, resulting in 1,740 and 4,522 HHOs in the derivation and validation studies, respectively. Comparisons of the mean and median HHOs per 24-hour period did not differ significantly. HHOs were 71.6 (95% confidence interval: 64.9-78.3) and 73.9 ( 95% confidence interval: 69.1-84.1), respectively.Conclusion: This study validates the HOW2 Benchmark Study and confirms that expected numbers of HHOs can be estimated from the unit's patient census and patient-to-nurse ratio.

J	Namouz, Essam Z.; Summers, Joshua D.				Summers, Joshua/B-7362-2009	Summers, Joshua/0000-0002-6129-2663			Comparison of Graph Generation Methods for Structural Complexity Based Assembly Time Estimation								JOURNAL OF COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCE IN ENGINEERING				14	2					021003	10.1115/1.4026293			JUN 2014	2014	This paper compares two different methods of graph generation for input into the complexity connectivity method to estimate the assembly time of a product. The complexity connectivity method builds predictive models for assembly time based on 29 complexity metrics applied to the product graphs. Previously, the part connection graph was manually created, but recently the assembly mate method and the interference detection method have introduced new automated tools for creating the part connectivity graphs. These graph generation methods are compared on their ability to predict the assembly time of multiple products. For this research, eleven consumers products are used to train an artificial neural network and three products are reserved for testing. The results indicate that both the assembly mate method and the interference detection method can create connectivity graphs that predict the assembly time of a product to within 45% of the target time. The interference detection method showed less variability than the assembly mate method in the time estimations. The assembly mate method is limited to only solid-works assembly files, while the interference detection method is more flexible and can operate on different file formats including IGES, STEP, and Parasolid. Overall, both of the graph generation methods provide a suitable automated tool to form the connectivity graph, but the interference detection method provides less variance in predicting the assembly time and is more flexible in terms of file types that can be used.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1530-9827	1944-7078		WOS:000335951700003

Ten isolates were examined from each field. Fungicide sensitivity assays were carried out based on visual assessment of diametrical mycelial growth after 4 days of incubation on media amended with discriminatory doses of fungicides in microtiter plates. Results of visual assessments were verified with selected isolates using a previously published germination assay and by inoculating representative isolates with resistant phenotypes on fungicide-sprayed fruit. The overall resistance frequencies of 750 isolates collected in 2012 for thiophanate-methyl, pyraclostrobin, boscalid, cyprodinil, fenhexamid, iprodione, and fludioxonil were 76, 42, 29, 27, 25, 3, and 1%, respectively. Frequencies of 1,060 isolates collected in 2013 were 85, 59, 5, 17, 26, 2, and 1%, respectively. Resistance to thiophanate-methyl and pyraclostrobin was found in virtually every location in both years, whereas resistance to iprodione and fludioxonil was rarely found. Resistant isolates were resistant to either one (23%), two (18%), three (19%), four (14%), five (3%), or six (0.1%) chemical classes of fungicides in 2012. In 2013, this distribution was 24, 29, 26, 8, 2, and 0.3%, respectively. Multifungicide-resistant isolates of B. cinerea were widespread in southern states and evidence suggests that the frequency of isolates with multifungicide resistance increased from 2012 to 2013. The data also show that fungicide resistance in B. cinerea was already present in blossoms, indicating that resistance management needs to be implemented early in the season.									16	1	0	13	0	17			0191-2917	1943-7692		WOS:000336005200016

Role of the Basement Membrane in Regulation of Cardiac Electrical Properties								ANNALS OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING				42	6			1148	1157		10.1007/s10439-014-0992-x			JUN 2014	2014	In the heart muscle, each adult cardiomyocyte is enclosed by a basement membrane (BM). This innermost extracellular matrix is a layered assembly of laminin, collagen IV, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans. In this study, the role of the BM network in regulation of the electrical properties of neonatal cardiomyocytes (NCMs) cultured on an aligned collagen I gel was investigated using a multielectrode array (MEA). A laminin antibody was added to the culture medium for 48-120 h to conjugate newly secreted laminin. Then, morphology of the NCMs on an MEA was monitored using a phase contrast microscope, and the BM network that was immunocytostained for laminin was imaged using a fluorescence microscope. When the BM laminin was absent in this culture model, dramatic changes in NCM morphology were observed. Simultaneously, the MEA-recorded cardiac field potential showed changes compared to that from the control groups: The period of contraction shortened to 1/2 of that from the control groups, and the waveform of the calcium influx shifted from a flat plateau to a peak-like waveform, indicating that the electrical properties of the NCMs were closely related to the components and distribution of the BM network.									4	0	0	3	0	4			0090-6964	1573-9686		WOS:000335653000003	24577875

The Eschatological Conversion of 'All the Nations' in Matthew 28.19-20: (Mis)reading Matthew through Paul								JOURNAL FOR THE STUDY OF THE NEW TESTAMENT				36	4			353	382		10.1177/0142064X13519375			JUN 2014	2014	The Great Commission in Matthew envisions the eschatological conversion of some from among 'all the nations' (pi alpha nu tau alpha tau alpha epsilon theta nu eta) to Israel's Messiah, Jesus of Nazareth, and to his authoritative interpretation of Torah, which, until the end arrives, includes the observance of its every 'letter and stroke of a letter'. Matthew's belief that foreigners will be converted to the Israelite covenant with YHWH at the ingathering of the lost sheep of the house of Israel coheres with other Second Temple Jewish texts and develops out of his reading of Isa. 56.1-8. Matthew is certainly unPauline in this regard, but he is not consciously anti-Pauline, as has been argued by David Sim. Yet, Matthew does advocate a position on Gentile inclusion into eschatological Israel that is fundamentally different from Paul's. Matthew and Paul stand in canonical tension on the nature of Torah observance for Gentiles wanting to enter the epsilon kappa lambda eta sigma iota alpha of Israel.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0142-064X	1745-5294		WOS:000361365200003

This report summarizes 239 site-years of field research examining effects of zero, moderate, and high stover removal rates at 36 sites in seven different states. Grain and stover yields from all sites as well as N, P, and K removal from 28 sites are summarized for nine longitude and six latitude bands, two tillage practices (conventional vs no tillage), two stover-harvest methods (machine vs calculated), and two crop rotations {continuous corn (maize) vs corn/soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]}. Mean grain yields ranged from 5.0 to 12.0 Mg ha(-1) (80 to 192 bu ac(-1)). Harvesting an average of 3.9 or 7.2 Mg ha(-1) (1.7 or 3.2 tons ac(-1)) of the corn stover resulted in a slight increase in grain yield at 57 and 51 % of the sites, respectively. Average no-till grain yields were significantly lower than with conventional tillage when stover was not harvested, but not when it was collected. Plant samples collected between physiological maturity and combine harvest showed that compared to not harvesting stover, N, P, and K removal was increased by 24, 2.7, and 31 kg ha(-1), respectively, with moderate (3.9 Mg ha(-1)) harvest and by 47, 5.5, and 62 kg ha(-1), respectively, with high (7.2 Mg ha(-1)) removal. This data will be useful for verifying simulation models and available corn stover feedstock projections, but is too variable for planning site-specific stover harvest.									15	0	0	12	0	15			1939-1234	1939-1242		WOS:000335400800008

High rates of corn stover removal can be associated with decreased soil organic matter (SOM) quantity and quality and increased highly erodible soil aggregate fractions. Limited data are available on the impact of stover harvesting on soil microbial communities which are critical because of their fundamental relationships with C and N cycles, soil fertility, crop protection, and stresses that might be imposed by climate change. Using fatty acid and DNA analyses, we evaluated relative changes in soil fungal and bacterial densities and fungal-to-bacterial (F:B) ratios in response to corn stover removal under no-till, rain-fed management. These studies were performed at four different US locations with contrasting soil-climatic conditions. At one location, residue removal significantly decreased F:B ratios. At this location, cover cropping significantly increased F:B ratios at the highest level of residue removal and thus may be an important practice to minimize changes in soil microbial communities where corn stover is harvested. We also found that in these no-till systems, the 0- to 5-cm depth interval is most likely to experience changes, and detectable effects of stover removal on soil microbial community structure will depend on the duration of stover removal, sampling time, soil type, and annual weather patterns. No-till practices may have limited the rate of change in soil properties associated with stover removal compared to more extensive changes reported at a limited number of tilled sites. Documenting changes in soil microbial communities with stover removal under differing soil-climatic and management conditions will guide threshold levels of stover removal and identify practices (e.g., no-till, cover cropping) that may mitigate undesirable changes in soil properties.									8	0	0	6	0	8			1939-1234	1939-1242		WOS:000335400800009

Influence of Corn Residue Harvest Management on Grain, Stover, and Energy Yields								BIOENERGY RESEARCH				7	2			590	597		10.1007/s12155-014-9433-9			JUN 2014	2014	Economic, environmental, and energy independence issues are contributing to rising fossil fuel prices, petroleum supply concerns, and a growing interest in biomass feedstocks as renewable energy sources. Potential feedstocks include perennial grasses, timber, and annual grain crops with our focus being on corn (Zea mays L.) stover. A plot-scale study evaluating stover removal was initiated in 2008 on a South Carolina Coastal Plain Coxville/Rains-Goldsboro-Lynchburg soil association site. In addition to grain and stover yields, carbon balance, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and soil quality impact reported elsewhere in this issue, variation in gross energy distribution within various plant fractions - whole plant, below ear shank (bottom), above ear shank (top), cob, as well as leaves and stems of the bottom and top portions (n ((part, year)) = 20) was measured with an isoperibol calorimeter. Stalks from above the ear shank were the most energy dense, averaging 18.8 MJ/kg db, and when combined with other plant parts from above the ear shank, the entire top half was more energy dense than the bottom half - 18.4 versus 18.2 MJ/kg db. Gross energy content of the whole plant, including the cob, averaged 18.28 +/- 0.76 MJ/kg db. Over the 4 years, partial to total removal (i.e., 25 % to 100 %) of above-ground plant biomass could supply between 30 and 168 GJ/ha depending upon annual rainfall. At 168 GJ/ha, the quantity of corn stover biomass (whole plant) available in a 3,254-km(2) area (32 km radius) around the study site could potentially support a 500-MW power plant.									4	0	0	3	0	4			1939-1234	1939-1242		WOS:000335400800014

Molecular systematics of the Simulium jenningsi species group (Diptera: Simuliidae), with three new fast-evolving nuclear genes for phylogenetic inference								MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION				75				138	148		10.1016/j.ympev.2014.02.018			JUN 2014	2014	A molecular phylogeny was inferred for the 22 nominal species of black flies in the Simulium jenningsi species group, which includes major pests of humans and livestock in North America. Females are structurally monomorphic, presenting a problem for identification of the pests. For each species, we sequenced approximately two kilobases from the mitochondrial genome (ND2, Cox I, proximal one-half of Cox II) and about six kilobases from the nuclear genome (ca. 2 kilobases each from 3 rapidly evolving nuclear genes: big zinc finger IBZFI, "5-intron gene" [5intG], and elongation complex protein 1 [ECP11) and analyzed them phylogenetically using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. The three nuclear loci have not previously been used in phylogenetic studies. The mitochondrial region recovered 6 group members as monophyletic. BZF, 5intG, and ECP1 sequences each permitted identification of 13 species and recovered the S. fibrinflatum and S. taxodium subgroups. Simulium aranti Stone and Snoddy and S. luggeri Nicholson and Mickel were consistently recovered at the base of the group. Simulium ozarkense Moulton and Adler, S. dixiense Stone and Snoddy, S. krebsorum Moulton and Adler, and S. haysi Stone and Snoddy branched off before two well-supported sister groups of the remaining species. This remainder consisted of species occupying slow, sandy lowland streams S. definitum Moulton and Adler, S. jonesi Stone and Snoddy, and the S. taxodium subgroup (S. taxodium Snoddy and Beshear, S. chlorum Moulton and Adler, S. confusum Moulton and Adler, and S. lakei Snoddy) as sister to two clades of species inhabiting swift, rocky upland streams the S. fibrinflatum subgroup (S. fibrinflatum Twinn, S. notiale Stone and Snoddy, and S. snowi Stone and Snoddy) and a clade comprised of S. anchistinum Moulton and Adler, S. jenningsi Malloch, and S. nyssa Stone and Snoddy, plus species having cocoons without anterolateral apertures (S. infenestrum Moulton and Adler, S. podostemi Snoddy, S. penobscotense Snoddy and Bauer, and S. remissum Moulton and Adler). Simulium snowi Stone and Snoddy is here considered a synonym of S. notiale Stone and Snoddy. Trees inferred from BZF and 5intG were largely concordant with those from ECP1, but slightly less resolved. Combining mitochondria] and nuclear data sets did not greatly improve the performance of the ECP1 data set alone. We, therefore, propose ECP1 as the gold standard for identification of members of the S. jenningsi group. Maximum likelihood analysis of combined sequences from all three nuclear genes, with three morphological constraints imposed, yielded a tree proposed as the best hypothesis of relationships among group members, based on all available data.

On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequencing and DNA base composition, strain MJ1(T) was assigned to the Firmicutes. The DNA G+C content was 42.8 mol%. Fermentative growth was supported by glucose and citrate in a defined basal medium. The bacterium is a strict anaerobe that grows between at pH 6.0 and pH 8.0 and 18 and 37 A degrees C. The culture did not grow with hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine (RDX) as the electron acceptor or mineralize RDX under these conditions. However, MJ1(T) transformed RDX into MNX, methylenedinitramine, formaldehyde, formate, ammonium, nitrous oxide, and nitrate. The nearest phylogenetic relative with a validly published name was Desulfotomaculum guttoideum (95 % similarity). However, MJ1(T) was also related to Clostridium celerecrescens DSM 5628 (95 %), Clostridium indolis DSM 755 (94 %), and Clostridium sphenoides DSM 632 (94 %). DNA:DNA hybridization with these strains was between 6.7 and 58.7 percent. The dominant cellular fatty acids (greater than 5 % of the total, which was 99.0 % recovery) were 16:0 fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) (32.12 %), 18:1cis 11 dimethyl acetal (DMA) (16.47 %), 16:1cis 9 DMA (10.28 %), 16:1cis 9 FAME (8.10 %), and 18:1cis 9 DMA (5.36 %). On the basis of morphological, physiological, and phylogenetic data, Clostridium geopurificans is proposed as a new species in genus Clostridium, with strain MJ1(T) as the type strain.									4	0	0	4	0	4			0343-8651	1432-0991		WOS:000334267700010	24522483

Some polymethine dyes are characterized with strong IR absorption and therefore can significantly improve light energy harvesting characteristics in such devices due to extension of the absorption spectrum of the photoconducting layer to the IR region. In a view of these opportunities, photovoltaic properties of BHJ systems constituted with poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) as an electron donor, 6,6-phenyl-C-61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) ful-lerene- type electron acceptor, and cation polymethine or merocyanine dyes were studied depending on the dye concentration and under different light excitation conditions. A new physical effect of photoinduced current hysteresis was observed in dye containing BHJ solar cells, when the dye concentration was in the range of 16-60%. The photocurrent hysteresis is detected only when simultaneously polythiophene and dye molecules are excited with light (white light excitation), while no current hysteresis can be seen in the dark or under selective excitation of the polymer component (490 nm) or dye component (740 nm) of the BHJ system. In addition, significant reduction of the photocurrent collected from the dye-containing devices under illumination with white light in comparison to a selective excitation of the polymer component only is observed. Therefore, the phenomenon can be described as an illumination induced photoresistance of the composite BHJ layer. It can be explained based on energy diagram consideration as a generation of transition dipole moments at polymethine dye molecules located close to the heterojunction and thus opposing donor-acceptor charge transfer events.

We demonstrate that the deformation modes can be controlled by the hydrogenation patterning parameters.

This research investigates the impact of a vertical porosity distribution on the overall permeability of pervious concrete. First, an unimpaired porosity-permeability relationship was generated using pervious concrete specimens which had uniform porosity throughout. This relationship was then used in conjunction with the vertical porosity distribution of surface compacted pervious concrete specimens to generate a vertical permeability distribution. An effective permeability value was used to summarize the overall behavior of the permeability distribution and was shown to have a much better correlation with the actual permeability of the specimens than the permeability predicted using the average porosity of the specimen. Additionally, an analysis of the relationship between the permeability distribution and the effective permeability showed that the minimum permeability (and therefore minimum porosity) tends to have the largest impact on the effective permeability.

Based on the rejuvenation theory and some related studies, rejuvenator, waste cooking and cotton seed oils can be used for asphalt regeneration. The objective of this study was to investigate the high temperature rheological properties of rejuvenating aged asphalt binder with rejuvenator, waste cooking and cotton seed oils. The materials used for this study included three sources of aged asphalt (recovered from reclaimed asphalt pavement), one virgin asphalt (PG 64-22), and three rejuvenating materials: rejuvenator, waste cooking and cotton seed oils with three percentages (0%, 5%, and 10% of rejuvenating asphalt). The used mass ratio of aged to virgin asphalt is 1:3 (i.e. 25% aged binder) in this study. The high temperature characteristics of these rejuvenated asphalts were tested including rutting resistance factor (phase angle and complex modulus), failure temperature and rotational viscosity. The results indicated that the rutting resistance factor and the complex modulus of rejuvenated binders decreased due to the addition of rejuvenator, cotton seed oil or waste cooking oil while their phase angles increased. In addition, the aged asphalt used a small amount of waste cooking oil or cotton seed oil can more easily achieve the demand of PG 64 binder in rutting resistance factor, phase angle, complex modulus and failure temperature of aged asphalt compared with rejuvenator. Finally, waste cooking oil or cotton seed oil can slightly reduce the viscosity value of the aged asphalt and thus decrease the mixing and compaction temperatures of the mixture.

JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES				119	10			5757	5766		10.1002/2013JD021446			MAY 27 2014	2014	A recent observation in NOAA's National Climatic Data Center's monthly assessment of the state of the climate was that contiguous U. S. average monthly temperatures were in the top third of monthly ranked historical temperatures for 13 straight months from June 2011 to June 2012. The chance of such a streak occurring randomly was quoted as (1/3) 13, or about one in 1.6 million. The streak continued for three more months before the October 2012 value dropped below the upper tercile. The climate system displays a degree of persistence that increases this probability relative to the assumption of independence. This paper puts forth different statistical techniques that more accurately quantify the probability of this and other such streaks. We consider how much more likely streaks are when an underlying warming trend is accounted for in the record, the chance of streaks occurring anywhere in the record, and the distribution of the record's longest streak.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2169-897X	2169-8996		WOS:000337766600001

The Reference Transcriptome of the Adult Female Biting Midge (Culicoides sonorensis) and Differential Gene Expression Profiling during Teneral, Blood, and Sucrose Feeding Conditions								PLOS ONE				9	5					e98123	10.1371/journal.pone.0098123			MAY 27 2014	2014	Unlike other important vectors such as mosquitoes and sandflies, genetic and genomic tools for Culicoides biting midges are lacking, despite the fact that they vector a large number of arboviruses and other pathogens impacting humans and domestic animals world-wide. In North America, female Culicoides sonorensis midges are important vectors of bluetongue virus (BTV) and epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV), orbiviruses that cause significant disease in livestock and wildlife. Libraries of tissue-specific transcripts expressed in response to feeding and oral orbivirus challenge in C. sonorensis have previously been reported, but extensive genome-wide expression profiling in the midge has not. Here, we successfully used deep sequencing technologies to construct the first adult female C. sonorensis reference transcriptome, and utilized genome-wide expression profiling to elucidate the genetic response to blood and sucrose feeding over time. The adult female midge unigene consists of 19,041 genes, of which less than 7% are differentially expressed during the course of a sucrose meal, while up to 52% of the genes respond significantly in blood-fed midges, indicating hematophagy induces complex physiological processes. Many genes that were differentially expressed during blood feeding were associated with digestion (e.g. proteases, lipases), hematophagy (e.g., salivary proteins), and vitellogenesis, revealing many major metabolic and biological factors underlying these critical processes. Additionally, key genes in the vitellogenesis pathway were identified, which provides the first glimpse into the molecular basis of anautogeny for C. sonorensis. This is the first extensive transcriptome for this genus, which will serve as a framework for future expression studies, RNAi, and provide a rich dataset contributing to the ultimate goal of informing a reference genome assembly and annotation. Moreover, this study will serve as a foundation for subsequent studies of genome-wide expression analyses during early orbivirus infection and dissecting the molecular mechanisms behind vector competence in midges.									5	0	0	3	0	5			1932-6203			WOS:000336914100034	24866149

S. adults by gender and race.Methods: This cross-sectional analysis included participants (aged >= 20 years) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2010. Sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the optimal cutoff points for identifying undiagnosed diabetes and prediabetes were calculated for FINDRISC by gender and race/ethnicity.Results: Among the 20,633 adults (>= 20 years), 49.8% were women and 53.0% were non-Hispanic White. The prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes and prediabetes was 4.1% and 35.6%, respectively. FINDRISC was positively associated with the prevalence of diabetes (OR = 1.48 for 1 unit increase, p < 0.001) and prediabetes (OR = 1.15 for 1 unit increase, p < 0.001). The area under ROC for detecting undiagnosed diabetes was 0.75 for total population, 0.74 for men and 0.78 for women (p = 0.04); 0.76 for White, 0.76 for Black and 0.72 for Hispanics (p = 0.03 for White vs. Hispanics). The area under ROC for detecting prediabetes was 0.67 for total population, 0.66 for men and 0.70 for women (p < 0.001); 0.68 for White, 0.67 for Black and 0.65 for Hispanics (p < 0.001 for White vs. Hispanics). The optimal cutoff point was 10 (sensitivity = 0.75) for men and 12 (sensitivity = 0.72) for women for detecting undiagnosed diabetes; 9 (sensitivity = 0.61) for men and 10 (sensitivity = 0.69) for women for detecting prediabetes.Conclusions: FINDRISC is a simple and non-invasive screening tool to identify individuals at high risk for diabetes in the U. S. adults.									14	1	2	5	0	16			1932-6203			WOS:000338323200032	24852786

High resolution transmission electron microscopy and micro-Raman spectroscopy revealed polytypism-free zinc blende (ZB) NWs over lengths of several tens of micrometers for a mean diameter of 50 nm. Micro-photoluminescence studies of individual NWs showed linewidths smaller than those reported elsewhere which is consistent with the crystalline quality of the NWs. HVPE makes use of chloride growth precursors GaCl of which high decomposition frequency after adsorption onto the liquid droplet catalysts, favors a direct and rapid introduction of the Ga atoms from the vapor phase into the droplets. High influxes of Ga and As species then yield high axial growth rate of more than 100 mu m/h. The diffusion of the Ga atoms in the liquid droplet towards the interface between the liquid and the solid nanowire was investigated by using density functional theory calculations. The diffusion coefficient of Ga atoms was estimated to be 3 x 10(-9) m(2)/s. The fast diffusion of Ga in the droplet favors nucleation at the liquid-solid line interface at the center of the NW. This is further evidence, provided by an alternative epitaxial method with respect to metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy and molecular beam epitaxy, of the current assumption which states that this type of nucleation should always lead to the formation of the ZB cubic phase.

Eight nominal species and species complexes in three genera were identified among more than 31,000 specimens. Urosimulium faurei (Bernard, Grenier & Bailly-Choumara), Simulium (Eusimulium) mellah Giudicelli & Bouzidi, and Simulium (Nevermania) lundstromi (Enderlein) were recorded for the first time in northeastern Algeria. Three cytoforms of the Simulium (Eusimulium) velutinum complex and two morphoforms of Simulium (Nevermannia) ruficorne Macquart were found. The most abundant and ubiquitous taxon, Simulium (Wilhelmia) pseudequinum Seguy, representing nearly 80% of collected specimens, occupied the widest range of habitats, including those with anthropogenic influences.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1175-5326	1175-5334		WOS:000335889300008

Addition of PEG plasticizer to samples of IM electrolytes caused a decrease in electrolyte viscosity coupled to an increase in ionic conductivity. MD simulations revealed that addition of plasticizer increased self-diffusion coefficients for both cations and anions with the plasticizer being the fastest diffusing species. Application of a VTF model to fit variable-temperature conductivity and fluidity data shows that plasticization decreases the apparent activation energy (E-a) and pre-exponential factor A for ion transport and also for viscous flow. Increased ionic conductivity with plasticization is thought to reflect a combination of factors including lower viscosity and faster polyether chain segmental dynamics in the electrolyte, coupled with a change in the ion transport mechanism to favor ion solvation and transport by polyethers derived from the plasticizer. Current interrupt experiments with Li/electrolyte/ Li cells revealed evidence for salt concentration polarization in electrolytes containing large amounts of plasticizer but not in electrolytes without added plasticizer.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1520-6106			WOS:000336199100017	24773589	
J	Knapp, Benjamin O.; Walker, Joan L.; Wang, G. Geoff; Hu, Huifeng; Addington, Robert N.								Effects of overstory retention, herbicides, and fertilization on sub-canopy vegetation structure and functional group composition in loblolly pine forests restored to longleaf pine								FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT				320				149	160		10.1016/j.foreco.2014.03.021			MAY 15 2014	2014	The desirable structure of longleaf pine forests, which generally includes a relatively open canopy of pines, very few woody stems in the mid-story, and a well-developed, herbaceous ground layer, provides critical habitat for flora and fauna and contributes to ecosystem function. Current efforts to restore longleaf pine to upland sites dominated by second-growth loblolly pine require information about how restoration treatments affect sub-canopy vegetation. We established a field experiment at Fort Benning in Georgia and Alabama, USA to determine the effects of four levels of approximately uniform canopy density (Control [similar to 16 m(2)/ha basal area], MedBA [similar to 9 m(2)/ha basal area], LowBA [similar to 5 m(2)/ha basal area], and Clearcut [0 m(2)/ha basal area]) and three cultural treatments (NT [untreated], H [chemical control of woody and herbaceous vegetation] and H + F [chemical control plus fertilization]) on vegetation structure and functional group composition for three growing seasons following canopy removal. In general, cover (a measure of abundance) of ground layer vegetation increased with the amount of canopy removal. The ground layer was dominated by herbaceous vegetation in each year. Canopy trees generally suppressed the cover of graminoids in the first two years after treatment but only the Control plots had lower graminoid cover than Clearcut plots after the third growing season. Forb cover was significantly lower on Control plots than on Clearcut plots after only the first growing season, and woody stems/shrubs had lower cover on Control plots than on LowBA or Clearcut plots in each year. Vegetation cover increased following the first year after canopy removal, and the relative dominance of functional groups did not change through time. Canopy retention limited the development of mid-story woody stems, with the greatest stem densities in the Clearcut plots. The herbicide treatment (on both H and H + F) significantly reduced woody stem density in the mid-story in 2009, but the effect was no longer significant in 2010. Traditional methods for converting stands of other pine species to longleaf pine commonly include clearcutting followed by planting, but our results suggest that clearcutting may release woody vegetation to increase mid-story stem densities and will reduce the amount of pine needles in the fuel bed. Retaining low to moderate levels of canopy density (5-9 m(2)/ha basal area) in loblolly pine stands may provide an effective balance for reaching multiple restoration objectives that include maintaining desirable vegetation structure and creating fuel conditions for a frequent fire regime.

Conjugated Polymers for the Fluorescent Detection of Nitroaromatics: Influence of Side-Chain Sterics and pi-System Electronics								JOURNAL OF POLYMER SCIENCE PART A-POLYMER CHEMISTRY				52	10			1487	1492		10.1002/pola.27143			MAY 15 2014	2014	A series of eight poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) and poly(p-phenylene ethynylene) (PPE) (P1-P8) derivatives were tested for their ability to detect the nitroaromatic explosive 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and its model compound 2,6-dinitrotoluene (DNT). The polymers P1-P8 represent five structural classes that have not been examined for nitroaromatic sensing. These new motifs include PPE derivatives with a main-chain m-terphenyl unit (P1) or oxacyclophane canopy-like structure (P2) and PPV derivatives with 2,6-mesitylenephenylene repeats (P3 and P4), 9,9-dialkyl-1,4-fluorenylene repeats (P5 and P6), or m-phenylene units that periodically disrupt -conjugation along the backbone of the polymer (P7 and P8). The time-dependent photoluminescent response of films to TNT and DNT and the solution-phase Stern-Volmer quenching constants for both TNT and DNT were determined. The results are rationalized in terms of side-chain sterics and -system electronics and are discussed relative to known conjugated polymers. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym.

Molecular structures of the constituents of pyrene pitches								FUEL				124				133	140		10.1016/j.fuel.2014.01.093			MAY 15 2014	2014	The main dimeric species present in pyrene pitches produced via both catalytic (with AlCl3) and thermal polymerization of pure pyrene have been identified. Characterization of these species was performed by first isolating dimer-rich pitch fractions either by semi-continuous supercritical extraction (SCE) with N-methyl pyrrolidine-toluene mixtures or by solvent extraction with dichloromethane. These fractions were then separated into their individual species via reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Molecular weight and structure information of the eluted species was obtained by a combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI) and UV-vis spectroscopy. By following this strategy, two alternant (i.e., six-membered ring) pyrene dimer isomers, dinaphtho[2,1,8,7-defg:2',1',8',7'-opqr]pentacene and dinaphtho[2,1,8,7-defg:2',1',8',7'-ijkl]pentaphene, were found in both the catalytically and thermally produced pitches. Non-alternant (i.e., containing a connecting five-membered ring) pyrene dimer isomers (cyclopenta[1,2,3-cd:4,5-e']dipyrene and cyclopenta[1,2-a:3,4,5-c'd']dipyrene) were also found in both pitches. Interestingly, small amounts of methylated monomeric and oligomeric species (e. g., methyl and dimethyl pyrene; methyl and dimethyl pyrene dimer, etc.) were detected in the catalytically produced pitch, but were completely absent in both the starting monomer and in the thermally produced pitch. These results indicate that the main difference between the two polymerization methods are the AlCl3-induced methylation reactions that occur simultaneously to dehydrogenative condensation reactions.

Here we present the results for a coarse-grained model based on atomistic simulation of atactic polystyrene (PS). Similar to previous work by Harmandaris et al. and Fritz et al., each monomer is described by two coarse-grained beads. In contrast to these early studies in which intramolecular potentials were based on Monte Carlo simulations of isotactic and syndiotactic single PS molecules to capture stereochemistry, we obtained intramolecular interactions from a single molecular dynamics simulation of an all-atom atactic PS melt. The nonbonded interactions are obtained using the iterative Boltzmann inversion (IBI) scheme. This methodology has been extended to coarse graining of poly(4-tert-butylstyrene) (PtBS) in which an additional type of coarse-grained bead is used describe the tert-butyl group. Similar to the process for PS, the intramolecular interactions are obtained from a single all-atom melt simulation for atactic PtBS.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0024-9297	1520-5835		WOS:000336020900051

It was found that the formation of Pr-rich grain boundary regions gives rise to an enhancement in carrier mobility. In this Letter, we investigate the electronic and thermal transport in Sr1-xPrxTiO3 ceramics in order to determine the optimum doping concentration and to evaluate the overall thermoelectric performance. Simultaneous enhancement in the thermoelectric power factor and reduction in thermal conductivity in these samples resulted in more than 30% improvement in the dimensionless thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) for the whole temperature range over all previously reported maximum values. Maximum ZT value of 0.35 was obtained at 500 degrees C. (c) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0003-6951	1077-3118		WOS:000336918600080

Such signatures and their time behavior "X-ray" the bulk debris field in direct fashion, and do not depend on the ofttimes problematic and elaborate UV, optical, and near-infrared spectroscopy and radiative transfer that have informed the study of these events for decades. However, to date no hard photons have ever been detected from a Type Ia supernova in explosion. With the advent of the supernova SN 2014J in M82, at a distance of similar to 3.5 Mpc, this situation may soon change. Both NuSTAR and INTEGRAL have the potential to detect SN 2014J, and, if spectra and light curves can be measured, would usefully constrain the various explosion models published during the last similar to 30 yr. In support of these observational campaigns, we provide predictions for the hard X-ray continuum and gamma-line emissions for 15 Type Ia explosion models gleaned from the literature. The model set, containing as it does deflagration, delayed detonation, merger detonation, pulsational delayed detonation, and sub-Chandrasekhar helium detonation models, collectively spans a wide range of properties, and hence signatures. We provide a brief discussion of various diagnostics (with examples), but importantly make the spectral and line results available electronically to aid in the interpretation of the anticipated data.									16	0	0	2	0	16			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000335884500064

Six treatment groups were equally represented on each of 10 tray levels (blocks) of a single-stage incubator. The 6 treatment groups, containing 21 eggs each, were randomly arranged on each tray level with respect to those on other tray levels. A multi-egg injector was used to inject eggs on d 18 of incubation according to their preassigned treatments. The experimental treatments included noninjected and diluent-injected (100 mu L of commercial diluent) controls, and those that received 0.15, 0.30, 0.60, or 1.20 mu g of 25(OH)D-3 in 100 mu L of diluent. On d 0 and 21 posthatch, 3 chicks from each treatment replicate group were randomly selected for necropsy and the subsequent extraction of their left tibial bones. Tibia samples were weighed and then subjected to breaking strength and ash concentration analysis. One of the 3 residual bone ash samples in each treatment replicate group was randomly selected, digested, and analyzed for Ca, P, Mg, K, Zn, and Mn concentrations. The relative weight, breaking strength, and percentage ash and mineral concentrations of broiler tibias on d 0 and 21 posthatch were not affected by treatment. However, trend analysis of percentage tibial ash on d 21 revealed a dosage effect (P = 0.068). The results of this study suggest that the in ovo injection of 0.15 to 1.20 mu g of 25(OH)D-3 on d 18 of incubation did not influence subsequent bone development or mineralization in Ross x Ross 708 broilers on d 0 and 21 posthatch. Nevertheless, further trend analysis suggested that increased dosage levels of 25(OH)D-3 above 1.20 mu g may have the potential to lead to increases in bone mineralization.									4	0	0	4	0	4			0032-5791	1525-3171		WOS:000335970000002	24795296

Treatment with Coated Layer Double Hydroxide Clays Decreases the Toxicity of Copper-Contaminated Water								ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY				66	4			549	556		10.1007/s00244-013-9986-1			MAY 2014	2014	Copper is a common pollutant found in watersheds that exerts toxic effects on both invertebrates and vertebrates. Layer double hydroxide (LDH) clays are able to adsorb a wide range of contaminants through ion-exchange mechanisms. Coating LDH clays with various materials alters the aggregation of clay particles into the nano-size range, thus increasing relative surface area and offering great potential for contaminant remediation. The goal of this study was to determine if treatment with coated LDH clays decreases the toxicity of copper-containing solutions to Daphnia magna. Four LDH clays with different coatings used to alter hydrophobicity were as follows: used: Na+ montmorillonite, Zn-Al LDH-nitrate, Zn-Al LDH-stearate, and Zn-Al LDH-carbonate. It was determined that coated LDH clays decreased copper toxicity by decreasing bioavailability and that smaller aggregate sizes decreased bioavailability the most. 96 h LC50 values increased by as much as 4.2 times with the treatment of the solutions with 100 mg/L LDH clay. Copper analysis of the clay and solutions indicated that the clays work by decreasing copper bioavailability by way of a binding mechanism. Coated LDH clays hold promise as a small-scale remediation tool or as an innovative tool for toxicity identification and evaluation characterization of metals.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0090-4341	1432-0703		WOS:000334267200008	24442186

Development of a consistent continuum of the dimensional parameters of a vehicle for optimization and simulation								PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART D-JOURNAL OF AUTOMOBILE ENGINEERING				228	6			591	603		10.1177/0954407013497195			MAY 2014	2014	Parametric vehicle modeling permits rapid iteration and optimization of vehicles in the conceptual design phase. A significant portion of vehicle design can be optimized parametrically without knowing specific details based on computer-aided design. Many overall characteristics of a vehicle such as the curb mass, the location of the center of gravity, the key dimensions, the occupant packaging, and the cargo volume can be assessed and improved at the parametric level. Targets for the vehicle such as the 0-60 mile/h acceleration time, the stopping distance, the fuel economy, the low-speed turn radius and aspects of the vehicle dynamics and handling can also be determined to a high level of confidence. In developing the vehicle's dimensions for a parametric model it is recommended that a vehicle is built up using an inside-out' approach centered on effective knowledge-based occupant packaging. This work develops a continuum of the dimensional parameters which tie the vehicle's internal and external dimensions together; it employs a combination of industry standard dimensions and component dimensions defined by the present authors, which make up the outside dimensions of the overall vehicle. In order to develop and optimize models for a desired vehicle type and size class, a knowledge base of typical values for the key dimensional parameters of a vehicle was compiled using a combination of data sources and field measurements. These values provide a useful starting point for the vehicle design and optimization process. They also increase optimization effectiveness, reducing the likelihood of local minima and maxima, and ensure that optimization begins within a valid design space.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0954-4070	2041-2991		WOS:000334398600001

Corporate Social Responsibility, Customer Orientation, and the Job Performance of Frontline Employees								JOURNAL OF MARKETING				78	3			20	37					MAY 2014	2014	This study examines frontline employee responses to corporate social responsibility (CSR) using a multisourced data set at a Global 500 financial services company. The authors find that frontline employees identify with the organization (i.e., organizational identification) and with customers (i.e., employee-customer identification) as a function of how much the employees perceive management and customers (respectively) to support the company's CSR activities. However, these respective effects are stronger among employees far whom CSR is already tied to their sense of self (i.e., CSR importance to the employee). In addition, both organizational identification and employee-customer identification are related to supervisor-rated job performance; however, only the effect of employee-customer identification is mediated by customer orientation, suggesting that these two targets of identification manifest through distinct mechanisms. The research empirically addresses the open questions of whether and when CSR can yield observable changes in employee behavior and alerts researchers to a novel target of identification for frontline employees.									35	0	0	0	0	35			0022-2429	1547-7185		WOS:000340736500002		
J	Dragic, Peter D.; Mangognia, Anthony; Ballato, John								Chirped fiber Brillouin frequency-domain distributed sensing								OPTICAL ENGINEERING				53	5					056117	10.1117/1.OE.53.5.056117			MAY 2014	2014	A frequency-domain distributed temperature/strain sensor based on a longitudinally graded optical fiber (LGF) is proposed and evaluated. In an LGF, the Brillouin scattering frequency, nu(B), changes (i. e., is chirped) lengthwise monotonically and thus every position along the fiber has a unique nu(B). Any change locally (at some position) in the fiber environment will result in a measurable change in the shape of the Brillouin gain spectrum (BGS) near the frequency component mapped to that position. This is demonstrated via measurements and modeling for an LGF with local heating. The LGF is one with similar to 100 MHz Brillouin frequency gradient over 16.7 m, with 1.1 and 1.7 m segments heated up to 40 K above ambient. A measurement of the BGS can enable the determination of a thermal (or strain) distribution along a sensor fiber, thus rendering the system one that is in the frequency domain. A sensitivity analysis is also presented for both coherent and pump-probe BGS measurement schemes. The modeling results suggest that the frequency-domain systems based on fibers with a chirped Brillouin frequency are highly suited as inexpensive event sensors (alarms) and have the potential to reach submeter position determination with sub-1-K temperature accuracies at > 1 kHz sampling rates. Limitations to the technique are discussed. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License.

Our approach is based on comparing employer-reported earnings to market values of cars owned by the corresponding individuals and their households. We detect few hidden earnings in most foreign-owned firms and larger firms, especially state-owned enterprises in heavily regulated industries. The same empirical strategy indicates that up to 80 percent of earnings of car owners in the private sector are hidden, especially in smaller companies and industries such as trade and services, where cash flows are easier to manipulate. We also find considerable hidden earnings in government services. Our approach sheds new light on the decline in the gross domestic product (GDP) in Russia after the collapse of communism and subsequent recovery; in particular, we argue that a good deal of these changes might represent changes in income reporting rather than actual changes in GDP.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0022-2186	1537-5285		WOS:000339060900001

This article considers this tension in a historical context. Limits were sometimes placed on the number of votes that controlling shareholders could cast in corporate elections. These limits protected minority shareholders by giving them relatively more voting than cash-flow rights. The evidence shows that voting limits led to less shareholder concentration and less leverage. Banks with less concentrated ownership adopted policies that notably reduced insolvency risk.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0022-2186	1537-5285		WOS:000339060900005

In this paper we propose a novel and efficient method to measure the semantic similarity of GO terms. The proposed method addresses the limitations in existing GO term similarity measurement techniques; it computes the semantic content of a GO term by considering the information content of all of its ancestor terms in the graph. The aggregate information content (AIC) of all ancestor terms of a GO term implicitly reflects the GO term's location in the GO graph and also represents how human beings use this GO term and all its ancestor terms to annotate genes. We show that semantic similarity of GO terms obtained by our method closely matches the human perception. Extensive experimental studies show that this novel method also outperforms all existing methods in terms of the correlation with gene expression data. We have developed web services for measuring semantic similarity of GO terms and functional similarity of genes using the proposed AIC method and other popular methods. These web services are available at http://bioinformatics.clemson.edu/G-SESAME.									7	1	0	3	0	8			1545-5963	1557-9964		WOS:000337904000003	26356015

Clustering of Cyclostationary Signals with Applications to Climate Station Sitings, Eliminations, and Merges								IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING				7	5	SI		1754	1762		10.1109/JSTARS.2013.2293713			MAY 2014	2014	This paper considers methods to classify and discriminate the multidimensional cyclostationary climatological time series. The methods take into account both the seasonal mean cycles and random behavior in the series, simultaneously considering means and all component-by-component autocovariances. This improves classical Hotelling T-2 statistics that classify through mean changes only, and constant-mean speech methods that classify exclusively through sample autocovariance differences. Here, two series are compared by assuming that both follow the same time series model; from this, a test statistic representing a distance between the two series is developed from linear prediction theory. This construction generates a level-test statistic for Gaussian data that can be used to assess how different the two series are. The derived distances can be used in a clustering algorithm, e. g., to group series with similar behavior. Such information is useful to eliminate or merge the climate stations whose data are redundant to another station or to optimally locate a collection of stations. The techniques are first tested on simulated series with known structures, and then applied to 11 two-dimensional series in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's data buoy catalog. Natural clusters emerge which are geographically realistic. Specifically, the methods were able to perfectly group stations in the Gulf of Mexico, the Carolina Coast, the Pacific Ocean, and offshore New England.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1939-1404	2151-1535		WOS:000337900700036

The main TFAs detected in chicken fillet were trans C18:2 fatty acids (FAs) and trans C18:3 FAs, which exhibited no significant differences among the frying cycles. Besides, the content of trans C18:1 FAs were very low in all samples on different frying cycles. The intake of TFAs was estimated to be 0.06 g/100 g when chicken fillet fried in this process was consumed. These results suggest that an ordinary frying process upon a commercial corn oil has little impact on the daily TFAs intake.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0963-7486	1465-3478		WOS:000334607300008	24575785

Neutral winds were measured by the red-line Fabry Perot interferometer at Jicamarca. Coherent radar backscatter from plasma irregularities associated with equatorial spread F (ESF) was also recorded. A numerical simulation of ionospheric irregularities, initialized and forced using parameterizations derived from a combination of measurements and empirical models, was used to try to reproduce the ESF activity that occurred on three different nights. Simulations were able to recover the salient features of the irregularities that formed in each case and produce bottom-type, bottomside, and topside ESF. Realistic simulations require the accurate representation of the vertical currents that generate irregularities initially at the base of the F region as well as the zonal currents necessary for irregularities to expand in altitude and penetrate to the topside. The campaign data, numerical simulations, and protocols used to associate them are presented and evaluated.									6	0	0	0	0	6			2169-9380	2169-9402		WOS:000337622100043

Here we show a general approach for rapid control of diffusional growth through nanoparticle self-assembly on the fast-growing phase during cooling. After phase nucleation, the nanoparticles spontaneously assemble, within a few milliseconds, as a thin coating on the growing phase to block/limit diffusion, resulting in a uniformly dispersed phase orders of magnitude smaller than samples without nanoparticles. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated in both inorganic (immiscible alloy and eutectic alloy) and organic materials. Our approach overcomes the microstructure refinement limit set by the fast phase growth during cooling and breaks the inherent limitations of surfactants for growth control. Considering the growing availability of numerous types and sizes of nanoparticles, the nanoparticle-enabled growth control will find broad applications.									23	0	0	2	0	23			2041-1723			WOS:000337503800023	24809454

Electromagnetic coupling between two neighboring slots was observed. By manipulating the number of slots, critical coupling of the coiled coaxial cable resonator can be well controlled. An ultrahigh signal-to-noise ratio (over 50 dB) at the resonant frequency band was experimentally achieved from a coiled coaxial cable resonator with 38 turns. A theoretic model is developed to understand the device physics. The proposed device can be potentially used as a high quality and flexibly designed band-stop filter or a sensor in structural health monitoring.

Debris discs are thought to be formed through the collisional grinding of planetesimals, and then can be considered as the outcome of planet formation. Understanding the properties of gas and dust in debris discs can help us comprehend the architecture of extrasolar planetary systems. Herschel Space Observatory far-infrared (IR) photometry and spectroscopy have provided a valuable dataset for the study of debris discs gas and dust composition. This paper is part of a series of papers devoted to the study of Herschel-PACS observations of young stellar associations.Aims. This work aims at studying the properties of discs in the beta Pictoris moving group (BPMG) through far-IR PACS observations of dust and gas.Methods. We obtained Herschel-PACS far-IR photometric observations at 70, 100, and 160 mu m of 19 BPMG members, together with spectroscopic observations for four of them. These observations were centred at 63.18 mu m and 157 mu m, aiming to detect [OI] and [CII] emission. We incorporated the new far-IR observations in the SED of BPMG members and fitted modified blackbody models to better characterise the dust content.Results. We have detected far-IR excess emission towards nine BPMG members, including the first detection of an IR excess towards HD 29391. The star HD 172555, shows [OI] emission, while HD 181296 shows [CII] emission, expanding the short list of debris discs with a gas detection. No debris disc in BPMG is detected in both [OI] and [CII]. The discs show dust temperatures in the range 55-264 K, with low dust masses (<6.6 x 10(-5) M-circle plus to 0.2 M-circle plus) and radii from blackbody models in the range 3 to similar to 82 AU. All the objects with a gas detection are early spectral type stars with a hot dust component.									15	1	0	0	0	16			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000336730900068

Structural equation modeling for the outcome of delinquent versus nondelinquent status showed direct paths of two latent constructs, developmental exceptionalities and early parenting problems, to delinquent outcome, with developmental problems also mediating the relationship between adverse parenting and delinquency. Separate analysis of the delinquent group indicated gender differences in the predictors of more serious offending (early arrests and recidivism), with adverse parenting a significant influence for girls only. Implications for prevention of juvenile delinquency were addressed.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0198-7429	2163-5307		WOS:000337050600001

Michael								Characterization of a Trichoderma atroviride strain isolated from switchgrass bales and its use to saccharify ammonia-pretreated switchgrass for biobutanol production								BIOMASS & BIOENERGY				64				299	308		10.1016/j.biombioe.2014.03.017			MAY 2014	2014	The feedstock-specific enzyme systems for saccharification of biofuel feedstocks like switchgrass may potentially provide better enzymatic systems for production of second-generation biofuels. One strategy to develop these enzyme systems could be to harness the microorganisms growing naturally on specific feedstocks. This study presents the isolation and screening of fungal cultures from switchgrass bales for saccharification of ammonia-pretreated switchgrass for subsequent biobutanol production. The best performing fungal isolate during screening was identified through Sanger sequencing of its ITS region to be a unique strain of Trichodenna atroviride and further characterized for production of an enzyme system for saccharification of ammonia pretreated switchgrass. The maximum FPase, CMCase and xylanase activity produced by T. atroviride CUA1 were 0.25 fpu/mL, 0.18 IU/mL and 5.8 IU/mL, respectively. T. atroviride CUA1 also produced considerable amount of B-glucosidase activity. This isolate was used to produce an enzyme system to convert switchgrass to soluble sugars that were then fermented to butanol, ethanol, acetate and butyrate. Glucose was the major product of hydrolysis of ammonia-pretreated switchgrass performed using the enzyme system produced by the isolate. This fungus may be useful for the hydrolysis for the bioenergy crop of switchgrass to overcome this rate-limiting step in the overall conversion of biomass to biofuels. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent work (PLoS Computational Biology 9(2): e1002924) indicates that homodimerization may be important for forming an electrostatic funnel in the spermine synthase homodimer which guides changed substrates toward the active centers. This prompted us to investigate the electrostatic properties of a large set of homodimeric proteins and resulted in an observation that in a vast majority of the cases the dimerization indeed results in specific electrostatic features, although not necessarily in an electrostatic funnel. It is demonstrated that the electrostatic dipole moment of the dimer is predominantly perpendicular to the axis connecting the centers of the mass of the monomers. In addition, the surface points with highest potential are located in the proximity of the interfacial plane of the homodimeric complexes. These findings indicate that frequent homodimerization provides specific electrostatic features needed for the function of proteins.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0219-6336	1793-6888		WOS:000336957000009		
J	Li, Lin; Li, Chuan; Alexov, Emil								On the modeling of polar component of solvation energy using smooth Gaussian-based dielectric function								JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL & COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY				13	3	SI				1440002	10.1142/S0219633614400021			MAY 2014	2014	Traditional implicit methods for modeling electrostatics in biomolecules use a two-dielectric approach: a biomolecule is assigned low dielectric constant while the water phase is considered as a high dielectric constant medium. However, such an approach treats the biomolecule-water interface as a sharp dielectric border between two homogeneous dielectric media and does not account for inhomogeneous dielectric properties of the macromolecule as well. Recently we reported a new development, a smooth Gaussian-based dielectric function which treats the entire system, the solute and the water phase, as inhomogeneous dielectric medium (Li L, Li C, Zhang Z, Alexor E, On the dielectric constant of proteins: Smooth dielectric function for macromolecular modeling and its implementation in Delphi, J Chem Theory Comput 9(4): 2126-2136, 2013). Here we examine various aspects of the modeling of polar solvation energy in such inhomogeneous systems in terms of the solute-water boundary and the inhomogeneity of the solute in the absence of water surrounding. The smooth Gaussian-based dielectric function is implemented in the DelPhi finite-difference program, and therefore the sensitivity of the results with respect to the grid parameters is investigated, and it is shown that the calculated polar solvation energy is almost grid independent. Furthermore, the results are compared with the standard two-media model and it is demonstrated that on average, the standard method overestimates the magnitude of the polar solvation energy by a factor 2.5. Lastly, the possibility of the solute to have local dielectric constant larger than of a bulk water is investigated in a benchmarking test against experimentally determined set of pKa's and it is speculated that side chain rearrangements could result in local dielectric constant larger than 80.									7	0	0	4	0	7			0219-6336	1793-6888		WOS:000336957000004

In the core of the proposed method, by applying the feedback linearization technique, the known dynamics of the robot's manipulator is removed; then, in order to overcome the remaining uncertainties, a classic sliding mode control is designed. Afterward, by applying the TS fuzzy model, the classic sliding mode controller is converted to fuzzy sliding mode controller with very simple rule base. The mathematical analysis shows that the robot manipulator with the new proposed control in tracking the robot manipulator in presence of uncertainties has the globally asymptotic stability. Finally, to show the performance of the proposed method, the controller is simulated on a robot manipulator with two degrees of freedom as case study of the research. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed control scheme in presence of the structured and unstructured uncertainties.									17	3	0	0	0	19			0263-5747	1469-8668		WOS:000336846100007

In the use of conventional semiconductor QDs for such a purpose, the beautifully displayed dependence of fluorescence color on the particle diameter becomes a limitation. More recently, carbon dots have emerged as a new platform of QD-like fluorescent nanomaterials. The optical absorption and fluorescence emissions in carbon dots are not bandgap in origin, different from those in conventional semiconductor QDs. The absence of any theoretically defined fluorescence color - dot size relationships in carbon dots may actually be exploited as a unique advantage in the size reduction toward having carbon dots serve as ultracompact QD-like fluorescence probes. Here we report on carbon dots of less than 5 nm in the overall dot diameter with the use of 2,2'-(ethylenedioxy)bis(ethylamine) (EDA) molecules for the carbon particle surface passivation. The EDA-carbon dots were found to be brightly fluorescent, especially over the spectral range of green fluorescent protein. These aqueous soluble smaller carbon dots also enabled more quantitative characterizations, including the use of solution-phase NMR techniques, and the results suggested that the dot structures were relatively simple and better-defined. The potential for these smaller carbon dots to serve as fluorescence probes of overall sizes comparable to those of fluorescent proteins is discussed.									50	4	0	4	0	54			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000336640600041	24702526

High-throughput computing provides substantial time savings for landscape and conservation planning								LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING				125		SI		156	165		10.1016/j.landurbplan.2014.02.016			MAY 2014	2014	The social and ecological complexity of conservation has increased as a function of human transformation of landscapes, requiring robust decision support tools for planning. Remotely sensed data, available at increasingly fine-grain sizes, combined with powerful computing hardware and a plethora of software packages, provide landscape and conservation planners an opportunity to contribute to the design of future landscapes at local-regional extents. A computing limitation that has largely been accepted by the planning community is a sacrifice of grain size with increasing spatial extent. High-throughput and high-performance computing applications (i.e., "grid computing", "supercomputing") expand the potential for large-extent analyses with high-resolution data. We provide three landscape and conservation planning experiments that investigate to what degree high-throughput computing expedites spatial analyses at varying grains and extents. The first two distribute tasks to networked GIS computers: (1) detecting small landforms using fine-grained data over a limited spatial extent and (2) coarse-grained protected areas analysis at a continental-extent. The final experiment uses a supercomputer to run stand-alone software for a multi-step habitat connectivity analysis at moderate resolution and extent. All three experiments demonstrated massive time savings, shifting processing time for intensive landscape analyses from months to hours. We suggest high-throughput computing will improve landscape planning by (1) allowing finer grained analyses at greater extents, (2) reducing time consumed by complex algorithms, and (3) facilitating analyses of model sensitivities. Employing these methods may allow planners to ask and solve more complex ecological and planning questions and more accurately represent pattern and process at multiple scales. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Perceived Organizational Support, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms, and Stigma in Soldiers Returning From Combat								PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES				11	2			229	234		10.1037/a0034892			MAY 2014	2014	Research has shown that perceived organizational support (POS), or how much employees believe their organizations value their contributions and well-being, is an important predictor of employee mental health outcomes. To support employee mental health in high-risk occupations, organizations may want to identify variables that explain the relationship between POS and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Using a longitudinal design and a military sample, the present study found a relationship between POS and stigma as well as PTSD symptoms. Stigma partially mediated the relationship between POS at Time 1 and PTSD symptoms at Time 2. The partial mediation indicates that a supportive environment may also create a climate of reduced stigma in which soldiers may be comfortable addressing PTSD symptoms. Both results suggest positive actions that organizations can take to support employee mental health.									5	0	0	1	0	5			1541-1559	1939-148X		WOS:000336784900013	24364593

Biochemical and Kinetic Characterization of Xylulose 5-Phosphate/Fructose 6-Phosphate Phosphoketolase 2 (Xfp2) from Cryptococcus neoformans								EUKARYOTIC CELL				13	5			657	663		10.1128/EC.00055-14			MAY 2014	2014	Xylulose 5-phosphate/fructose 6-phosphate phosphoketolase (Xfp), previously thought to be present only in bacteria but recently found in fungi, catalyzes the formation of acetyl phosphate from xylulose 5-phosphate or fructose 6-phosphate. Here, we describe the first biochemical and kinetic characterization of a eukaryotic Xfp, from the opportunistic fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, which has two XFP genes (designated XFP1 and XFP2). Our kinetic characterization of C. neoformans Xfp2 indicated the existence of both substrate cooperativity for all three substrates and allosteric regulation through the binding of effector molecules at sites separate from the active site. Prior to this study, Xfp enzymes from two bacterial genera had been characterized and were determined to follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics. C. neoformans Xfp2 is inhibited by ATP, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), and oxaloacetic acid (OAA) and activated by AMP. ATP is the strongest inhibitor, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.6 mM. PEP and OAA were found to share the same or have overlapping allosteric binding sites, while ATP binds at a separate site. AMP acts as a very potent activator; as little as 20 mu MAMP is capable of increasing Xfp2 activity by 24.8% +/- 1.0% (mean +/- standard error of the mean), while 50 mu M prevented inhibition caused by 0.6 mM ATP. AMP and PEP/OAA operated independently, with AMP activating Xfp2 and PEP/OAA inhibiting the activated enzyme. This study provides valuable insight into the metabolic role of Xfp within fungi, specifically the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, and suggests that at least some Xfps display substrate cooperative binding and allosteric regulation.									2	0	0	3	0	3			1535-9778	1535-9786		WOS:000335907900010	24659577

Most hospitals use root cause analysis as a method of serious event investigation. The authors postulate that this method suffers from 4 problems: (a) the use of root cause analysis is neither standardized nor reliable between organizations, (b) hospitals focus on "who" did "what" rather than on "why" the error occurred, (c) the identified causes are often too nonspecific to develop actionable correction plans, and (d) a standardized nomenclature does not exist to allow analysis of recurring errors across the organization. This article describes the modification of the Human Factors Analysis Classification System based on James Reason's theory of error causation for use in health care. This method resolves the 4 deficiencies noted above. The authors' experience investigating 105 serious events over 2 years is described.									6	0	0	2	0	6			1062-8606	1555-824X		WOS:000335548400001	23814026	
J	Mwaanga, Phenny; Carraway, Elizabeth R.; van den Hurk, Peter								The induction of biochemical changes in Daphnia magna by CuO and ZnO nanoparticles								AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY				150				201	209		10.1016/j.aquatox.2014.03.011			MAY 2014	2014	Whilst a considerable number of studies have been reported on the acute toxicity of nanoparticles (NPs) on invertebrates such as Daphnia magna, few Studies have been reported on the biochemical change (biomarkers) induction on these species by NPs, especially metal oxide NPs. The aim of this study was to investigate some biomarkers in D. magna induced by copper oxide (CuO) and zinc oxide (ZnO) NPs under controlled laboratory conditions. We exposed the 5 day old D. magna for 72 h to sublethal concentration of CuO and ZnO NPs in synthetic moderately hard water (MHW) with and without dissolved natural organic matter (NOM) and estimated the glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity, formation of oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and amounts of thiobarbituric acid reacting substances (TEARS) and metallothionein (MT). Additionally, complementary short term dissolution studies on CuO and ZnO NPs were conducted. The results showed inactivation of GST enzyme by both metal oxide NPs. The results also showed increased production of oxidized GSH, increased generation of TSARS and increased induction of MT. In the presence of NOM, significant reduction (p < 0.05) in these biochemical changes was observed. These results indicated that oxidative stress is one of the toxicity mechanisms for these metal oxide NPs. Furthermore, the results suggest that these metal oxide NPs compromise the health of D. magna, and possibly other aquatic organisms, and therefore have potential to affect ecosystem stability. The short term dissolution studies showed that the proportion of dissolved NPs is higher (1.2% and 70% of initial concentration for dissolved Cu and Zn, respectively) at low particle concentration and is lower (0.4% and 17% of initial concentration for dissolved Cu and Zn, respectively) at higher particle concentration. These results suggest that the observed toxicity may be caused by both metal oxide nanoparticles and metal ions dissociated from the nanoparticles. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Among a sample of 325 early childhood classrooms there was evidence for both general elements of teacher-child interaction (responsive teaching) and domain-specific elements related to positive management and routines and cognitive facilitation. Among a diverse population of 4-year-old children (n=1,407) responsive teaching was modestly associated with development across social and cognitive domains, whereas positive management and routines was modestly associated with increases in inhibitory control and cognitive facilitation was associated with gains in early language and literacy skills. The conceptual and methodological contributions and challenges of this approach are discussed.									34	0	0	1	1	35			0009-3920	1467-8624		WOS:000335786600030	24255933	
J	May, Todd								Moral Individualism, Moral Relationalism, and Obligations to Non-human Animals								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHILOSOPHY				31	2			155	168		10.1111/japp.12055			MAY 2014	2014	Moral individualists like Jeff McMahan and Peter Singer argue that our moral obligations to animals, both human and non-human, are grounded in the morally salient capacities of those animals. By contrast, what might be called moral relationalists argue that our obligations to non-human animals are grounded in our relationship to them. Moral relationalists are of various kinds, from relationalists regarding assistance to animals, such as Clare Palmer and Elizabeth Anderson, to relationalists grounded in a Wittgensteinian view of human practice, such as Cora Diamond and Alice Crary. This article argues that there are, in fact, two distinct types of moral reasons, those based on salient capacities and those based on relationships. Neither type of reason is reducible to the other, and there is no third type to which to reduce them both. Any attempt at reduction would run counter to deep intuitions about our moral relation to non-human animals as well as to other humans. Among the implications of this is that certain kinds of arguments, such as the argument from marginal cases, seem to be incomplete precisely because they do not capture the complexity of our moral relations to non-human animals.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0264-3758	1468-5930		WOS:000335402100004

Little is known about these emotional expressions or the compassionate responses providers make and how common these are in PC decision-making conversations. Objectives: To describe the types and frequency of emotional distress that patients and loved ones express and how providers respond to these emotions during PC decision-making consultations with seriously ill hospitalized patients. Methods: We used a quantitative descriptive approach to analyze 71 audio-recorded inpatient PC decision-making consultations for emotional distress and clinicians' responses to those emotions using reliable and established methods. Results: A total of 69% of conversations contained at least one expression of emotional distress. The per-conversation frequency of expressions of emotional distress ranged from 1 to 10. Anxiety/fear were the most frequently encountered emotions (48.4%) followed by sadness (35.5%) and anger/frustration (16.1%). More than half of the emotions related to the patient's feelings (53.6%) and 41.9% were related to the loved ones' own emotions. The majority of emotions were moderate in intensity (65.8%) followed by strong (20.7%) and mild (13.5%). Clinicians responded to a majority of emotions with a compassionate response (75.7%) followed by those with medical content (21.9%) and very few were ignored (1.3%). Conclusions: Expressions of emotional distress are common during PC consultations and are usually met with compassionate responses by the clinician.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1096-6218	1557-7740		WOS:000335581800016	24588656

Experimental data for three glass types are used to guide the computational study, which considers glass material to be viscous with and without shear thinning and viscoelastic using the Maxwell upper-convected model. The study starts with assuming no-slip at the glass/die interface to see if material behavior alone can explain the die swell results, and then considers slip using the Navier model where interface shear is directly proportional to the relative slip speed at the interface. Consistent with the possibility of slip and intended high viscosity applications, viscosity ranging from 10(7.4)-10(8.8)Pas was used. Based on optimization of the various input parameters required to achieve the measured die swell and ram force values, the study concludes that interface slip occurred as only extreme values of the shear thinning parameters provided an alternative.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000335809400039

The goal of this study was to improve adult human vascular smooth muscle cell orientation and elastic matrix synthesis within 3D tubular collagen gel constructs. We used a combination of elastogenic factors (EFs) previously tested in our lab, along with cyclic circumferential strains at low amplitude (2.5%) delivered at a range of frequencies (0.5, 1.5, and 3Hz). After 21 days of culture, the constructs were analyzed for elastic matrix outcomes, activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)-2 and -9, cell densities and phenotype, and mechanical properties of constructs. While cell densities remained unaffected by the addition of stretch, contractile phenotypic markers were elevated in all stretched constructs relative to control. Constructs cultured with EFs stretched at 1.5Hz exhibited the maximum elastin mRNA expression and total matrix elastin (over sixfold vs. the static EFs control). MMP-2 content was comparable in all treatment conditions, but MMP-9 levels were elevated at the higher frequencies (1.5 and 3Hz). Minimal circumferential orientation was achieved and the mechanical properties remained comparable among the treatment conditions. Overall, constructs treated with EFs and stretched at 1.5Hz exhibited the most elastogenic outcomes.									7	0	0	4	0	7			1937-3341	1937-335X		WOS:000335661400007	24313750

Although several laminin- and collagen IV-derived peptides are commercially available, they do not support long-term hNSC attachment and growth. To solve this problem, we developed a novel peptide sequence with only 12 amino acids based on the Ile-Lys-Val-Ala-Val, or IKVAV, sequence: Ac-Cys-Cys-Arg-Arg-Ile-Lys-Val-Ala-Val-Trp-Leu-Cys. This short peptide sequence, similar to tissue-derived full laminin molecules, supported hNSCs to attach and proliferate to confluence for continuous passage and subculture. This short peptide also directed hNSCs to differentiate into neurons. When conjugated to poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogels, this short peptide benefited hNSC attachment and proliferation on the surface of hydrogels and promoted cell migration inside the hydrogels with maximum enhancement at a peptide density of 10 mu M. This novel short peptide shows great promise in artificial niche development for supporting hNSC culture in vitro and in vivo and for promoting hNSC transplantation in future clinical therapy.									11	1	0	8	0	11			2157-6564	2157-6580		WOS:000335939000023	24692587

Many of these primitive eukaryotes have streamlined their metabolism, favoring glycolysis for generating ATP in the glucose-rich environments in which they reside. Therefore, the enzymes involved in hexose metabolism could prove to be attractive targets for therapeutic development. This hypothesis is supported by a number of chemical and genetic validation studies. Additionally, the peculiar biochemistry of many of the components, along with limited protein sequence identity emphasizes the likelihood of developing compounds that selectively inhibit the parasite enzymes. In this review, we examine the status of target validation at the genetic and/or chemical levels from the protozoan parasites. While the proteins from some species have been interrogated to the point that well-defined lead compounds have been identified with activities against both enzyme and parasite growth, progress in other systems has to date been limited.									3	0	0	2	0	3			0929-8673	1875-533X		WOS:000334356600002	24083603	
J	Gao, Feng; Sun, Boxing; Xing, Shenyang; Yu, Xianzhong; Lu, Chunyan; Li, Aonan; Zhao, Zhihui; Yang, Runjun								The effect of leader peptide mutations on the biological function of bovine myostatin gene								GENE				540	2			171	177		10.1016/j.gene.2014.02.052			MAY 1 2014	2014	The growth of muscle fibers can be negatively regulated by bovine myostatin. The first two exons of myostatin gene code for the N-propeptide and its third exon codes for the C-polypeptide. Myostatin is secreted as a latent configuration formed by dimerization of two matured C peptides non-covalently linked with the N terminal propeptide. Pro-peptide has two distinct functions in guiding protein folding and regulating biological activity of myostatin. When the structure of the leader peptide is altered via mutations resulting in more tight binding with the mature peptide, myostatin function is inhibited, resulting in the changes of P21 and CDK2 expression levels which are related to the regulation of cell cycle. In the present study, the coding region of bMSTN (bovine myostatin) gene was amplified and mutated (A224C and G938A) through fusion PCR, and the mutated bMSTN gene (bMSTN-mut) was inserted in frame into the pEFla-IRES-DsRed-Express2 vector and transfected into bovine fibroblast cells. The expression levels of bMSTN-mut, P21 and CDK2 (cyclin dependent kinase 2) were examined with qPCR and Western-blotting. Changes in cell cycle after transfection were also analyzed with flow cytometry. The results indicated that leader peptide mutation resulted in down-regulation of P21 expression levels and up-regulation of CD1C2 expression levels. The flow cytometry results showed that the proportion of cells in the G0/G1-phase was lower and that of cells in the S-phase was higher in bMSTN-mut transfected group than that in the control group. The proliferation rate of bMSTN-mut transfected cells was also significantly higher than that of the control cells. In conclusion, the studies have shown that the pEFla-IRES-DsRed-Express2-bMSTN-mut recombinant plasmid could effectively promote the proliferation of bovine fibroblast cells. The site-directed mutagenesis of bMSTN gene leader peptide and in vitro expression in bovine fibroblast cells could be helpful to further the studies of bMSTN in regulating bovine muscle cell growth and development.

J	Tietje, A.; Li, J.; Yu, X.; Wei, Y.								MULT1E/mIL-12: a novel bifunctional protein for natural killer cell activation								GENE THERAPY				21	5			468	475		10.1038/gt.2014.15			MAY 2014	2014	Natural killer (NK) cells have the potential to be effective killers of tumor cells. They are governed by inhibitory and activating receptors like NKG2D, whose ligands are normally upregulated in cells that are stressed, like cancer cells. Advanced cancer cells, however, have ways to reduce these ligands' expression, leaving them less detectable by NK cells. Along with these receptors, NK cells also require activating cytokines, like interleukin 12 (IL-12). The goal of this study is to develop a novel bi-functional fusion protein for enhanced NK cell activation. The proposed protein combines the extracellular domain of the NKG2D ligand Mouse UL-16-binding protein-like transcript 1 (MULTI E) and mouse IL-12 (mIL-12). It is hypothesized that when expressed by tumor cells, the protein will activate NK and other killer cells using the NKG2D receptor, and deliver mIL-12 to the NK cells where it can interact with the IL-12R and enhance cytotoxicity. The fusion protein, when expressed by engineered tumor cells, indeed activated NK cells in vitro as assayed by increased production of interferon-gamma and cytotoxicity and significantly reduced tumor growth in vivo. Although the study is preliminary, the data suggest that the MULT1E/mIL-12 bi-functional fusion protein is an effective activator of NK cells for cancer treatment.									4	0	0	3	0	4			0969-7128	1476-5462		WOS:000335620800002	24572784	
J	Pardue, Michael J.; Castle, James W.; Rodgers, John H., Jr.; Huddleston, George M., III								Treatment of oil and grease in produced water by a pilot-scale constructed wetland system using biogeochemical processes								CHEMOSPHERE				103				67	73		10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.11.027			MAY 2014	2014	Constructed wetland treatment systems (CWTSs) can effectively remove many constituents that limit beneficial use of oilfield produced water. The objectives of this investigation were: (1) to assess the effect of mass loadings of oil and grease (O & G) on treatment performance in pilot-scale subsurface flow and free water surface CWTS series having sequential reducing and oxidizing cells, and (2) to evaluate effects on treatment performance of adding a pilot-scale oil-water separator. Increase in O & G mass loading from 5 to 20 mg min(-1) caused decreases in both dissolved oxygen concentration and sediment redox potential, which affected treatment performance. Biogeochemical pathways for removal of O & G, iron, and manganese operate under oxidizing conditions, and removal rate coefficients for these constituents decreased (0.905-0.514 d(-1) for O & G, 0.773-0.452 d(-1) for iron, and 0.970-0.518 d(-1) for manganese) because greater mass loading of O & G promoted reducing conditions. With increased mass loading, removal rate coefficients for nickel and zinc increased from 0.074 to 0.565 d(-1) and from 0.196 to 1.08 d(-1), respectively. Although the sequential reducing and oxidizing cells in the CWTS were very effective in treating the targeted constituents, an oil-water separator was added prior to wetland cells to enhance O & G removal at high inflow concentration (100 mg L-1). The oil-water separator removed approximately 50% of the O & G, and removal extents and efficiencies approximated those observed at 50 mg L-1 inflow concentration during treatment without an oil-water separator.

Recent studies suggest that dysmetabolism may contribute to the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation; however, the putative mechanism in patients undergoing CABG surgery is unknown. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha) has been demonstrated as a master regulator of myocardial energy metabolism, and glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3) has both a higher affinity for glucose and a much greater transport capacity compared with GLUT1, GLUT2, and GLUT4. We sought to evaluate the role of energy metabolism, especially the glucose metabolism, on patients after isolated CABG surgery.Methods and resultsRight atrial appendages were obtained from 79 patients who were in normal sinus rhythm and undergoing isolated CABG; those who exhibited new-onset POAF (n=22) or remained in sinus rhythm (n=57) were prospectively matched on the basis of preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative characteristics. POAF was assessed by electrocardiogram and must have required the initiation of antiarrhythmic therapy or anticoagulation. Local PGC-1 alpha and GLUT3 concentrations were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in tissue homogenates. The comparison of mRNA expression was tested by quantitative real-time PCR. PGC-1 alpha and GLUT3 levels and the related protein mRNA expression were significantly reduced in POAF patients compared with controls (P < 0.05). This selective reduction in PGC-1 alpha was associated with the presence of diabetes mellitus (P < 0.05).ConclusionPatients who have low PGC-1 alpha and GLUT3 levels are at increased risk for new-onset POAF. The myofibrillar energetic impairment may be important in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation.									3	1	0	2	0	4			0954-6928	1473-5830		WOS:000334546600007	24463787

Multivariate Analysis of Water Quality and Plankton Assemblages in an Urban Estuary								ESTUARIES AND COASTS				37	3			695	711		10.1007/s12237-013-9714-0			MAY 2014	2014	Raritan Bay, located between the states of New York and New Jersey, has a long history of cultural eutrophication and associated harmful algal blooms (HABs). Despite striking chemical and biological alterations occurring in Raritan Bay, publications in the early 1960s were the last to report consecutive measurements of both water quality parameters and plankton species composition in this system. The objectives of this study were to characterize water quality trends and plankton composition in a eutrophic estuary, compare current environmental conditions to those documented in Raritan Bay 50 years ago (i.e., at the same six sampling sites), and to further clarify the relationship among nutrients, secondary consumers, and algal bloom generation in this system using ordination techniques. This study (monthly data collected from April 2010-October 2012) indicates that Raritan Bay continues to exhibit numerous symptoms of eutrophication, including high algal biomass, high turbidity, violations of the dissolved oxygen standard to protect fish health, and blooms of potentially harmful phytoplankton species. Altered spatial and temporal patterns for nitrate and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) over the past 50 years may suggest new, changing, or expanding sources of nutrients. A total of 14 HAB species have been identified, including Heterosigma akashiwo, which formed a bloom in the upper Raritan Bay during summer 2012 in association with hypoxic conditions. Multivariate analyses indicate that abundance of this species is positively associated with high temperature, salinity, nitrate, and SRP and negatively associated with spring river discharge rates and total zooplankton abundance in Raritan Bay.									2	0	0	2	1	2			1559-2723	1559-2731		WOS:000334424300013		
J	Keyser, Tara L.; Zarnoch, Stanley J.								Stump sprout dynamics in response to reductions in stand density for nine upland hardwood species in the southern Appalachian Mountains								FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT				319				29	35		10.1016/j.foreco.2014.01.045			MAY 1 2014	2014	Much about stump sprout dynamics of upland hardwood trees species has been obtained in clearcuts. Information on the response of stump sprouts to alternative silvicultural treatments, including treatments that manipulate stand density and stand structure is lacking. In this study we examined the influence of harvest season and levels of basal area reduction on the probability of sprouting and subsequent sprout growth in the southern Appalachian Mountains. In 2009, 24 - 0.1 ha plots were established in fully-stocked mixed-hardwood forests near Asheville, North Carolina, USA. Basal area was mechanically reduced from below by 10%, 20%, 30%, or 40% between January and February, 2009 (dormant season) and again between July and August, 2010 (growing season), with each harvest season and level of basal area reduction combination randomly applied to three plots. For each stump, we recorded: (1) presence of live sprouts (yes/no); (2) height (m) of the dominant (i.e., tallest) sprout, and (3) area (m(2)) occupied by individual sprout clumps. All measurements were conducted one, two, and three years post-harvest. We used logistic regression and ANOVA to analyze the probability that a stump sprouts one year post-harvest and annual stump survival (i.e., the presence of at least one live sprout), sprout height, and area. Probability of sprouting was independent of dbh for red maple, dogwood, sourwood, hickory spp., chestnut oak, yellow-poplar, and sweet birch. For sweet birch the probability of sprouting was affected by harvest season, with 54% and 93% of stumps producing sprouts one year following growing and dormant season harvests, respectively. For blackgum and white oak, dbh was negatively correlated with the probability of sprouting. Stump survival varied by species and year. Third year stump survival was 38% lower for oak and hickory than sourwood and 32% lower than red maple. Dominant sprout height was significantly greater for red maple and sourwood than for oak and hickory, with the greatest height achieved under the 40% reduction in basal area treatment. By year three, dominant sprout height for both red maple and sourwood was 40% greater than for oak and hickory and 58% greater than other shade-tolerant midstory species. Our results suggest planning harvests to occur during a particular point in the year with the idea it will limit sprouting and subsequent sprout growth is ineffective and should not be considered a viable means of reducing the production or growth of stump sprouts.

J	Shen, Haiying; Li, Ze; Chen, Kang								A Scalable and Mobility-Resilient Data Search System for Large-Scale Mobile Wireless Networks								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS				25	5			1124	1134		10.1109/TPDS.2013.174			MAY 2014	2014	This paper addresses the data search problem in large-scale highly mobile and dense wireless networks. Current wireless network data search systems are not suitable for large-scale highly mobile and dense wireless networks. This paper presents a scalable and mobility-resilient LOcality-based distRibuted Data search system (LORD) for large-scale wireless networks with high mobility and density. Taking advantage of the high density, rather than mapping data to a location point, LORD maps file metadata to a geographical region and stores it in multiple nodes in the region, thus enhancing mobility-resilience. LORD has a novel region-based geographic data routing protocol that does not rely on flooding or GPSs for data publishing and querying, and a coloring-based partial replication algorithm to reduce data replicas in a region while maintaining the querying efficiency. LORD also works for unbalanced wireless networks with sparse regions. Simulation results show the superior performance of LORD compared to representative data search systems in terms of scalability, overhead, and mobility resilience in a highly dense and mobile network. The results also show the high scalability and mobility-resilience of LORD in an unbalanced wireless network with sparse regions, and the effectiveness of its coloring-based partial replication algorithm.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1045-9219	1558-2183		WOS:000334673200003		
J	Ryan, Joseph B.; Katsiyannis, Antonis; Losinski, Mickey; Reid, Robert; Ellis, Cynthia								Review of State Medication Policies/Guidelines Regarding Psychotropic Medications in Public Schools								JOURNAL OF CHILD AND FAMILY STUDIES				23	4			704	715		10.1007/s10826-013-9805-3			MAY 2014	2014	It is currently estimated that up to 6 million children take psychotropic medications for the treatment of mental health problems. The highest prevalence rates (50-76 %) are typically found among students with special needs, especially among those with ADHD and emotional disturbance. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 require medications be administered by schools whenever it is deemed necessary for the child to have access to educational services. However, these requirements do not extend to all students, nor do they provide guidance regarding the safest and most efficacious manner in which psychotropic medications should be administered. The authors reviewed existing state medication policies and guidelines to assess the level of guidance currently provided to school staff. Results showed the vast majority of states (48) provided guidance related to the administration of medications to students, with slightly fewer (44) states discussing required documentation procedures. Surprisingly, only 15 states addressed monitoring students for adverse side effects of medications, and even fewer (11) states specifically discussed psychotropic medication in their policies/guidelines. The vast majority (42) of states also addressed requirements for the safe and proper storage of medications, while slightly more than half of all states (31) provided any guidance regarding training of unlicensed personnel (e.g., secretaries) who frequently administer medications to students. The authors highlight several model guidelines/policies and review recommendations for best practice.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1062-1024	1573-2843		WOS:000334275300009

Woody vegetation communities of tidal freshwater swamps in South Carolina, Georgia and Florida (US) with comparisons to similar systems in the US and South America								JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE				25	3			848	862		10.1111/jvs.12115			MAY 2014	2014	QuestionsWhat are the general tree communities found in tidal freshwater swamps along four large coastal rivers in the southeastern United States (US)? How do these communities compare to other tidal freshwater swamps in the US and South America?LocationsTidal floodplains of major rivers along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the southeastern US: Savannah, Altamaha, Suwannee and Apalachicola Rivers.MethodsAn extensive survey of trees and shrubs was conducted to describe the communities from a range of tidal freshwater swamps. River basins studied include micro-tidal (Gulf coast) and meso-tidal (Atlantic coast) regimes, and study areas were located both near and distant to primary channels. A total of 128 plots (100m(2) each) were inventoried, distributed evenly over the Savannah and Altamaha Rivers along the Atlantic coast, and the Suwannee and Apalachicola Rivers along the Gulf coast. Multivariate statistics helped discern communities and the significant indicator species in each.ResultsFour general communities were characterized and named according to the strongest individual indicator species in each: Water Tupelo (Nyssa aquatica) Community, Swamp Tupelo (Nyssa biflora) Community, Dwarf Palmetto (Sabal minor) Community and Cabbage Palm (Sabal palmetto) Community.ConclusionsDescriptions of most tidal freshwater swamps in the southeastern US fit within the communities described in this study. Because studies that make inferences between environmental drivers (e.g. salinity, hydroperiod, hurricanes) and specific community types are best applied to the same communities (but perhaps different river systems), this work provides a framework by which tidal freshwater forested wetlands can be accurately compared based on their tree communities. We suggest that, within the broad range of our inventories, the four communities described identify the primary associations that should be tracked within most tidal freshwater swamps of the US. However, we identify some river basins in the US that do not fit this construct.Diversity of major tree communities in tidal freshwater swamps outside the US is generally much lower (with the notable exception of Amazonian hardwood tidal varzea), as are basal area values.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1100-9233	1654-1103		WOS:000334184300023

The presence of endophytes in plants can alter food webs, community composition and ecosystem processes, suggesting that endophyte-plant symbioses may represent unique forms of extended phenotypes. We tested the impact of the fungal endophyte Alternaria alternata (phylotype CID 120) on the allelopathic effect of the invasive forb Centaurea stoebe when in competition with the North American native bunchgrass Koeleria macrantha in a greenhouse competition experiment. The allelopathic effect of C. stoebe on K. macrantha when infected with the fungal endophyte was more than twice that of endophyte-free C. stoebe. However, this allelopathic effect was a small part of the very large competitive effect of C. stoebe on K. macrantha in all treatments, likely because of the priority effects in our experimental design. To our knowledge, these results are the first experimental evidence for a symbiotic relationship between plants and fungal endophytes affecting allelopathic interactions between competing plants, and thus provide insight into the mechanisms by which fungal endophytes may increase the competitive ability of their hosts.									15	4	0	16	0	18			0029-8549	1432-1939		WOS:000334691600026	24488227

In this study, the impact of Ag chemical speciation (Ag+ and Ag-NPs [50-nm uncoated and 15-nm polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-coated Ag-NPs]) to soil nitrification kinetics was investigated using a batch soil-slurry nitrification method along with sorption isotherm and dissolution experiments. The results of nitrification potential (i.e., kinetic rate) suggest that Ag+/Ag-NPs, which strongly sorb in soils, suppressed the nitrification processes. Among each chemical species, the degree of suppression increased with increasing [Ag](total). Although ionic Ag (Ag+) species is known to exhibit greater antimicrobial effects than the solid state Ag species, such as Ag-NPs, in most studies, PVP-coated 15-nm Ag-NPs, however, more effectively suppressed the soil nitrification process than did Ag+ under the same dose. Although several physicochemical-based toxicity mechanisms of dispersed Ag-NPs were discussed in pure culture and aquatic systems, it is not clearly understood how PVP-coated Ag-NPs could exhibit greater toxicity to nitrifying bacteria than Ag+ in soils. In assessing the impact of Ag-NPs to microbial mediated processes (e.g., N cycles) in the terrestrial environment, it might be critical to understand the interactions and reactivity of Ag-NPs at the soil-water interface.									5	0	0	5	0	5			0090-4341	1432-0703		WOS:000334267200004	24487627

Apart from the total energy, a wide variety of molecular properties may be calculated using these electronic-structure models. Molecular gradients and Hessians are available for geometry optimizations, molecular dynamics, and vibrational studies, whereas magnetic resonance and optical activity can be studied in a gauge-origin-invariant manner. Frequency-dependent molecular properties can be calculated using linear, quadratic, and cubic response theory. A large number of singlet and triplet perturbation operators are available for the study of one-, two-, and three-photon processes. Environmental effects may be included using various dielectric-medium and quantum-mechanics/molecular-mechanics models. Large molecules may be studied using linear-scaling and massively parallel algorithms. Dalton is distributed at no cost from for a number of UNIX platforms.									336	1	0	10	0	336			1759-0876	1759-0884		WOS:000334522200006

In order to assess the potential human and environmental risk associated with these recent initiatives, improved understanding of the fate and transport of Pu in the SRS subsurface environment is necessary. The hypothesis of this study was that the more mobile forms of Pu, Pu(V) and Pu(VI), would be reduced to the less mobile Pu(III/IV) oxidation states under ambient SRS subsurface conditions. Laboratory-scale dynamic flow experiments (i.e., column studies) indicated that Pu(V) was very mobile in SRS sediments. At higher pH values the mobility of Pu decreased and the fraction of Pu that became irreversibly sorbed to the sediment increased, albeit, only slightly. Conversely, these column experiments showed that Pu(IV) was essentially immobile and was largely irreversibly sorbed to the sediment. More than 100 batch sorption experiments were also conducted with four end-member sediments, i.e., sediments that include the chemical, textural, and mineralogical properties likely to exist in the SRS. These tests were conducted as a function of initial Pu oxidation state, pH, and contact time and consistently demonstrated that although Pu(V) sorbed initially quite weakly to sediments, it slowly, over the course of <33 days, sorbed very strongly to sediments, to approximately the same degree as Pu(IV). This is consistent with our hypothesis that Pu(V) is reduced to the more strongly sorbing form of Pu, Pu(IV). These studies provide important experimental support for a conceptual geochemical model for dissolved Pu in a highly weathered subsurface environment. That is that, irrespective of the initial oxidation state of the dissolved Pu introduced into a SRS sediment system, Pu(IV) controls the environmental transport within a couple weeks and Pu strongly binds to the sediment, limiting its mobility.

Dynamic Transcriptional Response of Escherichia coli to Inclusion Body Formation								BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOENGINEERING				111	5			980	999		10.1002/bit.25169			MAY 2014	2014	Escherichia coli is used intensively for recombinant protein production, but one key challenge with recombinant E. coli is the tendency of recombinant proteins to misfold and aggregate into insoluble inclusion bodies (IBs). IBs contain high concentrations of inactive recombinant protein that require recovery steps to salvage a functional recombinant protein. Currently, no universally effective method exists to prevent IB formation in recombinant E. coli. In this study, DNA microarrays were used to compare the E. coli gene expression response dynamics to soluble and insoluble recombinant protein production. As expected and previously reported, the classical heat-shock genes had increased expression due to IB formation, including protein folding chaperones and proteases. Gene expression levels for protein synthesis-related and energy-synthesis pathways were also increased. Many transmembrane transporter and corresponding catabolic pathways genes had decreased expression for substrates not present in the culture medium. Additionally, putative genes represented over one-third of the genes identified to have significant expression changes due to IB formation, indicating many important cellular responses to IB formation still need to be characterized. Interestingly, cells grown in 3% ethanol had significantly reduced gene expression responses due to IB formation. Taken together, these results indicate that IB formation is complex, stimulates the heat-shock response, increases protein and energy synthesis needs, and streamlines transport and catabolic processes, while ethanol diminished all of these responses.

SPIONs were first uptaken by endothelial cells before they were assembled into uniform-sized spheroids through a home-made robotic spheroid maker. To guide the magnetic spheroids, a unique magnetic template was fabricated using computer-aided design and cut from a magnetic sheet. The spheroids were then guided to the prefabricated magnetic template through the attractive magnetic forces between the SPIONs inside the endothelial cells and the magnetic template. Fusion of endothelial cell spheroids over time while adhered to the magnetic template allowed for the formation of 3D cell-based structures. Subsequent removal of the prefabricated magnetic template left 3-D endothelial cell sheets, which may be stacked to fabricate complicated 3D multicellular tissue structures. To enhance the cytocompatibility, SPIONs were silica-coated before use. At low concentrations, the SPIONs did not adversely affect cell viability, proliferation, and phenotype stability. Light and confocal microscopy showed that endothelial cell spheroids could be reproducibly created with high uniformity. The endothelial cells were able to remain viable and maintain the 3D structure in vitro. We have proved the concept to use SPIONs as a patterning agent to direct the attachment and self assembly of SPION-loaded endothelial cell spheroids on a prefabricated magnetic template for the formation of 3D cell based structures. A magnetic-directed technique allows quick patterning of cell spheroids in accordance with desirable magnetic patterns, therefore, holding promise for scalable fabrication of complicated 3D multicellular tissue structures. By varying the cell types and the prefabricated magnetic patterns, this magnetic-directed patterning strategy may find use in bioprinting and multicellular tissue graft fabrication.

J	Li, Lin; Li, Chuan; Alexov, Emil								On the Modeling of Polar Component of Solvation Energy using Smooth Gaussian-Based Dielectric Function.								Journal of theoretical & computational chemistry				13	3						10.1142/S0219633614400021			2014-May	2014	Traditional implicit methods for modeling electrostatics in biomolecules use a two-dielectric approach: a biomolecule is assigned low dielectric constant while the water phase is considered as a high dielectric constant medium. However, such an approach treats the biomolecule-water interface as a sharp dielectric border between two homogeneous dielectric media and does not account for inhomogeneous dielectric properties of the macromolecule as well. Recently we reported a new development, a smooth Gaussian-based dielectric function which treats the entire system, the solute and the water phase, as inhomogeneous dielectric medium (J Chem Theory Comput. 2013 Apr 9; 9(4): 2126-2136.). Here we examine various aspects of the modeling of polar solvation energy in such inhomogeneous systems in terms of the solute-water boundary and the inhomogeneity of the solute in the absence of water surrounding. The smooth Gaussian-based dielectric function is implemented in the DelPhi finite-difference program, and therefore the sensitivity of the results with respect to the grid parameters is investigated, and it is shown that the calculated polar solvation energy is almost grid independent. Furthermore, the results are compared with the standard two-media model and it is demonstrated that on average, the standard method overestimates the magnitude of the polar solvation energy by a factor 2.5. Lastly, the possibility of the solute to have local dielectric constant larger than of a bulk water is investigated in a benchmarking test against experimentally determined set of pKa's and it is speculated that side chain rearrangements could result in local dielectric constant larger than 80.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0219-6336			MEDLINE:25018579	25018579	
J	Rivera, A. Joy								A socio-technical systems approach to studying interruptions: Understanding the interrupter's perspective								APPLIED ERGONOMICS				45	3			747	756		10.1016/j.apergo.2013.08.009			MAY 2014	2014	The purpose of this study was to understand the cognitive processes underlying nurses' decision to interrupt other nurses. The Institute of Medicine (2000) reported that interruptions are likely contributors to medical errors. Unfortunately, the research to date has been quite homogenous, focusing only on the healthcare provider being interrupted, ignoring the true complexities of interruptions. This study took a socio-technical approach being the first to examine interruptions from the viewpoint of the interrupting nurse. Over 15 h of observations and 10 open-ended interviews with expert nurses in a Neuroscience Surgical Intensive Care Unit were conducted. It was found that nurses conduct a quick cost-benefit assessment to determine the interruptibility of other nurses and whether an interruption is value-added vs. non-value added. To complete the assessment, nurses consider several conditional factors related to the interruptee, the interrupter, and the nature of the interruption content, and different potential consequences of the interruption.

The effects of short-range Coulomb interaction, which is incorporated using a purely repulsive delta-function to model the strong screening effect due to the presence of the superconductor, are determined within a Hartree-Fock approximation of the effective Bogoliubov-De Gennes Hamiltonian that describes the low-energy physics of the wire. Through a numerical diagonalization procedure we obtain interaction corrections to the single particle eigenstates and calculate the extended topological phase diagram in terms of the chemical potential and the Zeeman energy. We find that, for a fixed Zeeman energy, the interaction shifts the phase boundaries to a higher chemical potential, whereas for a fixed chemical potential this shift can occur either at lower or higher Zeeman energies. These effects can be interpreted as a renormalization of the g-factor due to the interaction. The minimum Zeeman energy needed to realize Majorana fermions decreases with the increasing strength of the Coulomb repulsion. Furthermore, we find that in wires with multi-band occupancy this effect can be enhanced by increasing the chemical potential, i.e. by occupying higher energy bands.									10	0	0	0	0	10			0953-8984	1361-648X		WOS:000334579900003	24722427

Collins, CO ( 41 N, 105 W)								JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES				119	8			4600	4615		10.1002/2013JD020338			APR 27 2014	2014	Vertical wind and its tidal perturbations are critical for understanding energy and momentum budgets within the Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere. However, direct and precise observations of this tidal wind component are highly challenging due to its low magnitude (a few cm/s), and often smaller than the measurement uncertainty even if averaged over hours. A dynamical method to determine vertical wind tides from Na density tides was proposed and its validity tested by limited amount of data two decades ago. In this paper, we utilize the linear relationship between the perturbations of Na density and atmospheric density caused by wave perturbations to extend this method, and devise two new formulations for determining vertical wind tides from the Na lidar observed Na density and temperature in the mesopause region. By taking advantage of the established climatology of mean and tidal perturbations over Fort Collins, CO (41 degrees N, 105 degrees W), based on the data set between 2002 and 2008, we deduce diurnal and semidiurnal vertical wind tides from all three formulations. The deduced tidal amplitudes and phases are intercompared, along with the most recent, but well studied and tested, Climatological Tidal Model of the Thermosphere (CTMT) based on the Hough Mode Extension (HME) followed by a tidal spectrum analysis to address the different tidal components contribution to the total tidal behavior at this midlatitude location.

The absolute Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity of the [(NbOx)(a)/(Nb-doped SrTiO3)(b)](20) superlattices (SLs) were found to increase with decreasing layer thickness ratio (a/b ratio), reaching, at high temperatures, a power factor that is comparable to epitaxial Nb-doped SrTiO3 (STNO) films (similar to 0.7 W m(-1) K-1). High temperature studies reveal that the SLs behave as n-type semiconductors and undergo an irreversible change at a varying crossover temperature that depends on the a/b ratio. By use of high resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction, the irreversible changes are identified to be due to a phase transformation from cubic NbO to orthorhombic Nb2O5, which limits the highest temperature of stable operation of the superlattice to 950 K.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000334991300032

In particular, we investigate silicon nitride resonant gratings and titanium dioxide gratings on glass substrates as well as silicon-on-quartz gratings. These materials exhibit very low losses and are capable of high diffraction efficiencies and extinction ratios; thus, high-power laser applications may be enabled. We present the methods applied to fabricate these GMR devices as well as means to ascertain their fabricated physical parameters.

However, advances in genomics and functional techniques during this same period are ushering in a period of comparative innexin biology. Insects are the most diverse metazoan taxa in terms of species number, as well as in developmental, physiological, and morphological processes. Combined with genomics data, the study of innexins should rapidly advance. In this review, we consider the current state of knowledge regarding innexins in insects, focusing on innexin diversity, both evolutionary and functional. We also consider an unusual set of innexins, known as vinnexins, that have been isolated from mutualistic viruses of some parasitoid wasps. We conclude with a call to study insect innexins from a broader, evolutionary perspective. Knowledge derived from such comparative studies will offer significant insight into developmental and evolutionary physiology, as well as specific functional processes in a taxon that has huge biomedical and ecological impact on humans.

The assembly-free microdevice exhibited a fringe visibility of 20 dB and was demonstrated for measurement of the refractive index of the filling liquids.

The chlorinated swimming pool water contains higher chlorine residual and is maintained at a higher temperature than a typical drinking water distribution system. It constitutes environments with high levels of disinfection by-products (DBPs) in water and air as a consequence of continuous disinfection and constant organic loading from the bathers. Exposure to those DBPs is inevitable for any bather or trainer, while such exposures can have elevated risks to human health. To date, over 70 peer-reviewed publications have reported various aspects of swimming pool, including types and quantities of DBPs, organic loads from bathers, factors affecting DBPs formation in swimming pool, human exposure and their potential risks. This paper aims to review the state of research on swimming pool including with the focus of DBPs in swimming pools, understand their types and variability, possible health effects and analyze the factors responsible for the formation of various DBPs in a swimming pool. The study identifies the current challenge's and future research needs to minimize DBPs formation in a swimming pool and their consequent negative effects to bathers and trainers.

J	Lei, Yang; Sinha, Aditi; Nosoudi, Nasim; Grover, Ankit; Vyavahare, Naren								Hydroxyapatite and calcified elastin induce osteoblast-like differentiation in rat aortic smooth muscle cells								EXPERIMENTAL CELL RESEARCH				323	1			198	208		10.1016/j.yexcr.2014.01.011			APR 15 2014	2014	Vascular calcification can be categorized into two different types. Intimal calcification related to atherosclerosis and elastin-specific medial arterial calcification (MAC). Osteoblast-like differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) has been shown in both types; however, how this relates to initiation of vascular calcification is unclear. We hypothesize that the initial deposition of hydroxyapatite-like mineral in MAC occurs on degraded elastin first and that causes osteogenic transformation of VSMCs. To test this, rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMCs) were cultured on hydroxyapatite crystals and calcified aortic elastin. Using RT-PCR and specific protein assays, we demonstrate that RASMCs lose their smooth muscle lineage markers like alpha smooth muscle actin (SMA) and myosin heavy chain (MHC) and undergo chondrogenic/osteogenic transformation. This is indicated by an increase in the expression of typical chondrogenic proteins such as aggrecan, collagen type II alpha 1(Col2a1) and bone proteins such as runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteocalcin (OCN). Furthermore, when calcified conditions are removed, cells return to their original phenotype. Our data supports the hypothesis that elastin degradation and calcification precedes VSMCs' osteoblast-like differentiation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

A large thermoelectric power factor of 1.3 W m(-1) K-1 at 500 degrees C is achieved in these samples. In-depth investigations of the electronic transport and microstructure suggest that this significant improvement results from a substantial enhancement in carrier mobility originating from the formation of Pr-rich grain boundaries. This work provides new directions to higher performance oxide thermoelectrics as well as possibly other properties and applications of this broadly functional perovskite material.									16	0	0	1	0	16			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000334572300035

Predicting connectivity of green turtles at Palmyra Atoll, central Pacific: a focus on mtDNA and dispersal modelling								JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE				11	93					20130888	10.1098/rsif.2013.0888			APR 6 2014	2014	Population connectivity and spatial distribution are fundamentally related to ecology, evolution and behaviour. Here, we combined powerful genetic analysis with simulations of particle dispersal in a high-resolution ocean circulation model to investigate the distribution of green turtles foraging at the remote Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, central Pacific. We analysed mitochondrial sequences from turtles (n = 349) collected there over 5 years (2008-2012). Genetic analysis assigned natal origins almost exclusively (approx. 97%) to the West Central and South Central Pacific combined Regional Management Units. Further, our modelling results indicated that turtles could potentially drift from rookeries to Palmyra Atoll via surface currents along a near-Equatorial swathe traversing the Pacific. Comparing findings from genetics and modelling highlighted the complex impacts of ocean currents and behaviour on natal origins. Although the Palmyra feeding ground was highly differentiated genetically from others in the Indo-Pacific, there was no significant differentiation among years, sexes or stage-classes at the Refuge. Understanding the distribution of this foraging population advances knowledge of green turtles and contributes to effective conservation planning for this threatened species.									7	0	0	7	0	7			1742-5689	1742-5662		WOS:000332385000003	24451389

In this asymptotic regime, the queue length process can be approximated by a diffusion process that behaves as a Brownian motion with drift above zero and as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process below zero. We analyze the first passage times of this hybrid diffusion process to levels in the state space that represent congested states in the original queueing system.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1532-6349	1532-4214		WOS:000335850400002

Participants were presented with one of two virtual human conditions in a between-subjects experiment, static (non-animated) and dynamic (animated). Our objective measures included the use of psycho-physical Electro Dermal Activity (EDA) sensors, and subjective measures inspired by social psychology research included the Differential Emotions Survey (DES IV) and Positive and Negative Affect Survey (PANAS). We analyzed the quantitative and qualitative measures associated with participants' emotional state at four distinct time-steps in the simulated interpersonal experience as the virtual patient's medical condition deteriorated. Results suggest that participants in the dynamic condition with animations exhibited a higher sense of co-presence and greater emotional response as compared to participants in the static condition, corresponding to the deterioration in the medical condition of the virtual patient. Negative affect of participants in the dynamic condition increased at a higher rate than for participants in the static condition. The virtual human animations elicited a stronger response in negative emotions such as anguish, fear, and anger as the virtual patient's medical condition worsened.

Assessing the Aquatic Plant Community within the Ross Barnett Reservoir, Mississippi								INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT				7	2			375	383		10.1614/IPSM-D-13-00044.1			APR-JUN 2014	2014	Alligatorweed, waterhyacinth, and hydrilla are three nonnative aquatic species of concern in the Ross Barnett Reservoir near Jackson, MS. Point-intercept surveys were conducted on the reservoir from 2005 to 2010 to monitor native and nonnative species' distributions and assess herbicide treatment efficacy across the reservoir. Foliar applications of 2,4-D, glyphosate, imazapyr, and diquat were made during summer months for emergent and free-floating vegetation, whereas submersed applications of liquid copper and granular fluridone were applied in spring and late summer for subsurface hydrilla populations. American lotus is the native species that has been observed the most throughout the survey years, with occurrence frequencies averaging between 17 and 27%. Alligatorweed populations significantly decreased from 21% in 2005 to 4% in 2006; however, they consistently increased in the next 4 yr to 12% occurrence in 2010. Waterhyacinth occurrence has remained relatively constant over the study period, averaging below 10% occurrence. Hydrilla was discovered in the reservoir in late 2005 and has remained below 2% in frequency of occurrence since 2006. Suppression of these nonnative species has been attributed to rigorous monitoring and herbicide applications conducted on the reservoir since 2005. A logistic regression model indicated that as native species richness increased, the likelihood of a nonnative species occurring also increased.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1939-7291	1939-747X		WOS:000338479000018

Learning from these studies, the last decade resulted in significant advances that have led to the development of a new generation of polymeric materials in general, and colloids in particular, that exhibit stimuli-responsive attributes. As significant as hydrophobic interactions are in biological systems, the abundance of these and other interactions can be found in colloids that are capable of recognition and dynamic responsiveness leading to life-like materials with significant technological applications. Recent advances in the development of stimuli-responsive colloidal materials are discussed in the context of surface and bulk responsive morphologies, from dynamic shape and color changing colloidal nanoparticles to expandable nanotubes and polymer-modified metal nanoparticles. Stimuli-responsive and signaling attributes of macromolecular segments of colloids along with dispersing components will play key roles during colloidal film formation. Concurrently, the development of heterogeneous functional objects that can exhibit dimensional change initiated by light or other environmental factors will form a new platform of amazing and sparkling technologies for the 21st century capable of producing on-demand self-repairing colloid-based materials.

With this parametric evaluation, plasma optical emission was monitored in order to obtain a fundamental understanding with regards to rotational temperature (T-rot), excitation temperature (T-exc), electron number density (n(e)), and plasma robustness. Incentive for these studies is not only for a greater overall fundamental knowledge of the APGD, but also in instrumenting a secondary excitation/ionization source following laser ablation (LA). Rotational temperatures were determined through experimentally fitting of the N-2 and OH molecular emission bands while atomic excitation temperatures were calculated using a Boltzmann distribution of He and Mg atomic lines. The rotational and excitation temperatures were determined to be -1000 K and -2700 K respectively. Electron number density was calculated to be on the order of similar to 3 x 10(15) cm(-3) utilizing Stark broadening effects of the Ha line of the Balmer series and a He I transition. In addition, those diagnostics were performed introducing magnesium (by solution feed and laser ablation) into the plasma in order to determine any perturbation under heavy matrix sampling. The so-called plasma robustness factor, derived by monitoring Mg II/Mg I emission ratios, is also employed as a reflection of potential perturbations in microplasma energetics across the various operation conditions and sample loadings. While truly a miniaturized source (<1 mm(3) volume), the LS-APGD is shown to be quite robust with plasma characteristics and temperatures being unaffected upon introduction of metal species, whether by liquid or laser ablation sample introduction.

The toolbox, written in Python, can be used to evaluate seismic velocities of new mineral physics data or geodynamic models, and as the forward model in inversions for mantle composition. The user can define the composition from a list of minerals provided for the lower mantle or easily include their own. BurnMan provides choices in methodology, both for the EoS and for the multiphase averaging scheme. The results can be visually or quantitatively compared to observed seismic models. Example user scripts show how to go through these steps. This paper includes several examples realized with BurnMan: First, we benchmark the computations to check for correctness. Second, we exemplify two pitfalls in EoS modeling: using a different EoS than the one used to derive the mineral physical parameters or using an incorrect averaging scheme. Both pitfalls have led to incorrect conclusions on lower mantle composition and temperature in the literature. We further illustrate that fitting elastic velocities separately or jointly leads to different Mg/Si ratios for the lower mantle. However, we find that, within mineral physical uncertainties, a pyrolitic composition can match PREM very well. Finally, we find that uncertainties on specific input parameters result in a considerable amount of variation in both magnitude and gradient of the seismic velocities.									10	0	0	0	0	10			1525-2027			WOS:000336493400021

It occurs as two serotypes (A and D) representing two varieties (i.e. grubii and neoformans, respectively). Here, we sequenced the genome and performed an RNA-Seq-based analysis of the C. neoformans var. grubii transcriptome structure. We determined the chromosomal locations, analyzed the sequence/structural features of the centromeres, and identified origins of replication. The genome was annotated based on automated and manual curation. More than 40,000 introns populating more than 99% of the expressed genes were identified. Although most of these introns are located in the coding DNA sequences (CDS), over 2,000 introns in the untranslated regions (UTRs) were also identified. Poly(A)-containing reads were employed to locate the polyadenylation sites of more than 80% of the genes. Examination of the sequences around these sites revealed a new poly(A)-site-associated motif (AUGHAH). In addition, 1,197 miscRNAs were identified. These miscRNAs can be spliced and/or polyadenylated, but do not appear to have obvious coding capacities. Finally, this genome sequence enabled a comparative analysis of strain H99 variants obtained after laboratory passage. The spectrum of mutations identified provides insights into the genetics underlying the micro-evolution of a laboratory strain, and identifies mutations involved in stress responses, mating efficiency, and virulence.									58	1	0	56	0	79			1553-7404			WOS:000335499600027	24743168

Online 3D Gaze Localization on Stereoscopic Displays								ACM TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED PERCEPTION				11	1					3	10.1145/2593689			APR 2014	2014	This article summarizes our previous work on developing an online system to allow the estimation of 3D gaze depth using eye tracking in a stereoscopic environment. We report on recent extensions allowing us to report the full 3D gaze position. Our system employs a 3D calibration process that determines the parameters of a mapping from a naive depth estimate, based simply on triangulation, to a refined 3D gaze point estimate tuned to a particular user. We show that our system is an improvement on the geometry-based 3D gaze estimation returned by a proprietary algorithm provided with our tracker. We also compare our approach with that of the Parameterized Self-Organizing Map (PSOM) method, due to Essig and colleagues, which also individually calibrates to each user. We argue that our method is superior in speed and ease of calibration, is easier to implement, and does not require an iterative solver to produce a gaze position, thus guaranteeing computation at the rate of tracker acquisition. In addition, we report on a user study that indicates that, compared with PSOM, our method more accurately estimates gaze depth, and is nearly as accurate in estimating horizontal and vertical position. Results are verified on two different 4D eye tracking systems, a high accuracy Wheatstone haploscope and a medium accuracy active stereo display. Thus, it is the recommended method for applications that primarily require gaze depth information, while its ease of use makes it suitable for many applications requiring full 3D gaze position.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1544-3558	1544-3965		WOS:000335574900003		
J	Cheng, Gang; Hammouda, Boualem; Perahia, Dvora								Polystyrene-block-Polyisoprene Diblock-Copolymer Micelles: Coupled Pressure and Temperature Effects								MACROMOLECULAR CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS				215	8			776	782		10.1002/macp.201300760			APR 2014	2014	The structural changes of diblock-copolymer micelles under pressures from 200 to 16 000 psi are investigated using small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). Asymmetric polystyrene-block-polyisoprene (PS-PI) diblock copolymers are dissolved in decane, a selective solvent for PI, to form spherical micelles with a core of PS and a corona of PI. The micellar solutions are put under pressure at temperatures of 25 to 60 degrees C. At room temperature, elevating the pressure from 200 to 16 000 psi has no effect on the size of the micelles. While the micellar solutions remain stable, instantaneous association of micelles is detected. In contrast to micelles at atmospheric pressure, increasing the temperature at elevated pressures does not lead to dissociation of micelles; instead, the micelles aggregate and evolve into sheet-like structures, reminiscent of a macroscopic phase separation. Furthermore, higher pressures lead to a smaller temperature range in which shape transitions take place.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1022-1352	1521-3935		WOS:000334589100009

Prolactin (PRL) and its receptor (PRLR) are considered attractive therapeutic targets because of their roles as growth factors in tumor growth and progression. We utilized G129R, an antagonist peptide of PRL, to block activity of the tumoral PRL/PRLR axis, which resulted in inhibition of tumor growth in orthotopic models of human ovarian cancer. Prolonged treatment with G129R induced the accumulation of redundant autolysosomes in 3D cancer spheroids, leading to a type II programmed cell death. This inducible autophagy was a noncanonical beclin-1-independent pathway and was sustained by an astrocytic phosphoprotein (PEA-15) and protein kinase C zeta interactome. Lower levels of tumoral PRL/PRLR in clinical samples were associated with longer patient survival. Our findings provide an understanding of the mechanisms of tumor growth inhibition through targeting PRL/PRLR and may have clinical implications.									13	1	0	9	0	14			2211-1247			WOS:000335442300018	24703838

A missense mutation that alters the protein binding affinity may cause significant perturbations or complete abolishment of the function, potentially leading to diseases. The availability of computational methods to evaluate the impact of mutations on protein protein binding is critical for a wide range of biomedical applications. Here, we report an efficient computational approach for predicting the effect of single and multiple missense mutations on protein protein binding affinity. It is based on a well-tested simulation protocol for structure minimization, modified MM-PBSA and statistical scoring energy functions with parameters optimized on experimental sets of several thousands of mutations. Our simulation protocol yields very good agreement between predicted and experimental values with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.69 and 0.63 and root-mean-square errors of 1.20 and 1.90 kcal mol(-1) for single and multiple mutations, respectively. Compared with other available methods, our approach achieves high speed and prediction accuracy and can be applied to large datasets generated by modern genomics initiatives. In addition, we report a crucial role of water model and the polar solvation energy in estimating the changes in binding affinity. Our analysis also reveals that prediction accuracy and effect of mutations on binding strongly depends on the type of mutation and its location in a protein complex..									23	0	0	17	0	23			1549-9618	1549-9626		WOS:000334571900039	24803870

Tri-Phasic Size- and Janus Balance-Tunable Colloidal Nanoparticles (JNPs)								ACS MACRO LETTERS				3	4			346	352		10.1021/mz500029z			APR 2014	2014	These studies show synthesis of triphasic size- and Janus balance (JB)-tunable nanoparticles (JNPs) utilizing a two-step emulsion polymerization of pentafluorostyrene (PFS) and 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) and n-butyl acrylate (nBA) in the presence of poly(methyl methacrylate (MMA)/nBA) nanoparticle seeds. Each JNP consists of three phase-separated copolymers: p(MMA/nBA) core, temperature, and pH-responsive (p(DMAEMA/nBA)) phase capable of reversible size and shape changes, and shape-adoptable (p(PFS/nBA)) phase. Due to built-in second-order lower critical solution temperature (II-LCST) transition of p-(DMAEMA/nBA) copolymer, macromolecular segments collapse when temperature increases from 30 to 45 degrees C, resulting in size and shape changes. The p(DMAEMA/nBA) and p(MMA/nBA) phases within each JNP assume concave, flat, or convex shapes, forcing p(PFS/nBA) phase to adopt convex, planar, or concave interfacial curvatures, respectively. As a result, the JB can be tuned from 3.78 to 0.72. The presence of pH-responsive DMAEMA component also facilitates the size and JB changes due to protonation of the tertiary amine groups of p(DMAEMA/nBA) backbone. Synthesized in this manner, JNPs are capable of stabilizing oil droplets in water at high pH to form Pickering emulsions, which at lower pH values release oil phase. This process is reversible and can be repeated many times.									17	0	0	2	0	17			2161-1653			WOS:000334658100012		
J	Jenkins, Eleanor W.; John, Volker; Linke, Alexander; Rebholz, Leo G.								On the parameter choice in grad-div stabilization for the Stokes equations								ADVANCES IN COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS				40	2			491	516		10.1007/s10444-013-9316-1			APR 2014	2014	Standard error analysis for grad-div stabilization of inf-sup stable conforming pairs of finite element spaces predicts that the stabilization parameter should be optimally chosen to be . This paper revisits this choice for the Stokes equations on the basis of minimizing the error of the velocity and the error of the pressure. It turns out, by applying a refined error analysis, that the optimal parameter choice is more subtle than known so far in the literature. It depends on the used norm, the solution, the family of finite element spaces, and the type of mesh. In particular, the approximation property of the pointwise divergence-free subspace plays a key role. With such an optimal approximation property and with an appropriate choice of the stabilization parameter, estimates for the error of the velocity are obtained that do not directly depend on the viscosity and the pressure. The minimization of the error of the pressure requires in many cases smaller stabilization parameters than the minimization of the velocity error. Altogether, depending on the situation, the optimal stabilization parameter could range from being very small to very large. The analytic results are supported by numerical examples. Applying the analysis to the MINI element leads to proposals for the stabilization parameter which seem to be new.									14	0	0	0	0	14			1019-7168	1572-9044		WOS:000334683300009

Similarly, RNA binding ligands such as neomycin have been shown by us to bind to a number of A-form DNA structures. A neomycin-Hoechst 33258 conjugate was recently shown to bind B-DNA, where Hoechst exhibits high affinity for the minor groove of A/T tract DNA and neomycin docks into the major groove. Further studies now indicate that the Hoechst moiety of the conjugate can be driven to bind RNA duplex as a consequence of neomycin binding in the RNA major groove. This is the first example of Hoechst 33258 binding to RNA duplex not containing bulges or loop motifs.

Saccharification was achieved by cultivating either Phanerochaete chrysosporium or Gloeophyllum trabeum on the treated stover, and fermentation was then performed by using either Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Escherichia coli K011. Ethanol production was highest on day 3 for the combination of G. trabeum and E. coli K011 at 6.68 g/100 g stover, followed by the combination of P. chrysosporium and E. coli K011 at 5.00 g/100 g stover. SSF with S. cerevisiae had lower ethanol yields, ranging between 2.88 g/100 g stover at day 3 (P. chrysosporium treated stover) and 3.09 g/100 g stover at day 4 (G. trabeum treated stover). The results indicated that mild alkaline pretreatment coupled with fungal saccharification offers a promising bioprocess for ethanol production from corn stover without the addition of commercial enzymes.

J	Qiu, Chenxi; Shen, Haiying								A Delaunay-Based Coordinate-Free Mechanism for Full Coverage in Wireless Sensor Networks								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS				25	4			828	839		10.1109/TPDS.2013.134			APR 2014	2014	Recently, many schemes have been proposed for detecting and healing coverage holes to achieve full coverage in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, none of these schemes aim to find the shortest node movement paths to heal the coverage holes, which could significantly reduce energy usage for node movement. Also, current hole healing schemes require accurate knowledge of sensor locations; obtaining this knowledge consumes high energy. In this paper, we propose a Delaunay-based coordinate-free mechanism (DECM) for full coverage. Based on rigorous mathematical analysis, DECM can detect coverage holes and find the locally shortest paths for healing holes in a distributed manner without requiring accurate node location information. Also, DECM incorporates a cooperative movement mechanism that can prevent generating new holes during node movements in healing holes. Simulation results and experimental results from the real-world GENI Orbit testbed show that DECM achieves superior performance in terms of the energy-efficiency, effectiveness of hole healing, energy consumption balance and lifetime compared to previous schemes.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1045-9219	1558-2183		WOS:000334672900001

Due to the autonomous features of entities in CCC, the issues of resource management and reputation management must be jointly addressed in order to ensure the successful deployment of CCC. However, these two issues have typically been addressed separately in previous research efforts, and simply combining the two systems generates double overhead. Also, previous resource and reputation management methods are not sufficiently efficient or effective. By providing a single reputation value for each node, the methods cannot reflect the reputation of a node in providing individual types of resources. By always selecting the highest-reputed nodes, the methods fail to exploit node reputation in resource selection to fully and fairly utilize resources in the system and to meet users' diverse QoS demands. We propose a CCC platform, called Harmony, which integrates resource management and reputation management in a harmonious manner. Harmony incorporates three key innovations: integrated multi-faceted resource/reputation management, multi-QoS-oriented resource selection, and price-assisted resource/reputation control. The trace data we collected from an online trading platform implies the importance of multi-faceted reputation and the drawbacks of highest-reputed node selection. Simulations and trace-driven experiments on the real-world PlanetLab testbed show that Harmony outperforms existing resource management and reputation management systems in terms of QoS, efficiency and effectiveness.									15	3	0	0	0	15			1045-9219	1558-2183		WOS:000334672900004		
J	Shen, Haiying; Li, Ze; Liu, Guoxin; Li, Jin								SOS: A Distributed Mobile Q&A System Based on Social Networks								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS				25	4			1066	1077		10.1109/TPDS.2013.130			APR 2014	2014	Recently, emerging research efforts have been focused on question and answer (Q&A) systems based on social networks. The social-based Q&A systems can answer non-factual questions, which cannot be easily resolved by web search engines. These systems either rely on a centralized server for identifying friends based on social information or broadcast a user's questions to all of its friends. Mobile Q&A systems, where mobile nodes access the Q&A systems through Internet, are very promising considering the rapid increase of mobile users and the convenience of practical use. However, such systems cannot directly use the previous centralized methods or broadcasting methods, which generate high cost of mobile Internet access, node overload, and high server bandwidth cost with the tremendous number of mobile users. We propose a distributed Social-based mObile Q&A System (SOS) with low overhead and system cost as well as quick response to question askers. SOS enables mobile users to forward questions to potential answerers in their friend lists in a decentralized manner for a number of hops before resorting to the server. It leverages lightweight knowledge engineering techniques to accurately identify friends who are able to and willing to answer questions, thus reducing the search and computation costs of mobile nodes. The trace-driven simulation results show that SOS can achieve a high query precision and recall rate, a short response latency and low overhead. We have also deployed a pilot version of SOS for use in a small group in Clemson University. The feedback from the users shows that SOS can provide high-quality answers.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1045-9219	1558-2183		WOS:000334672900023

Here, a series of hollow cylinder tests on normally consolidated, medium-plasticity soft clay with and without principal stress rotation were performed along with finite-element modeling and simulation. The results show significant increases in both excess pore-water pressure and cumulative deformation of the normally consolidated soft clay when PSR is present and simulated, and the effects become more pronounced as the maximum effective principal stress ratio or load frequency increases. Under the actual traffic load-induced stress in subsoil below the subway tunnel, the presence of PSR increases the cumulative deformation of soft clay by 9-23% compared with that without PSR. As an approximation, the cumulative deformation of soft clay with the effect of PSR can be estimated by multiplying the deformation derived from the repeated triaxial testing without PSR with the ratio of axial strain between the two tests.									5	1	0	0	0	5			1090-0241	1943-5606		WOS:000334671400018

These inclusions are in the form of small platelets that are generally oriented both circumferentially and radially within the cladding material. There is concern that radially-oriented hydride inclusions may weaken the cladding material and lead to issues during used fuel storage and transportation processes. A high fidelity model of the mechanical behavior of hydrides has utility in both designing fuel cladding to be more resistant to this hydride-induced weakening and also in suggesting modifications to drying, storage, and transport operations to reduce the impact of hydride formation and/or the avoidance of loading scenarios that could overly stress the radial inclusions.We develop a mechanical model for the Zry4-hydride system that, given a particular morphology of hydride inclusions, allows the calculation of the response of the hydrided cladding under various loading scenarios. The model treats the Zry4 matrix material as J(2) elastoplastic, and treats the hydrides as platelets oriented in predefined directions (e.g., circumferentially and radially). The model is hosted by the Albany analysis framework, where a finite element approximation of the weak form of the cladding boundary value problem is solved using a preconditioned Newton-Krylov approach. Instead of forming the required system Jacobian operator directly or approximating its action with a differencing operation, Albany leverages the Trilinos Sacado package to form the Jacobian via automatic differentiation. We present results that describe the performance of the model in comparison with as-fabricated Zry4 as well as HB Robinson fuel cladding. Further, we also present performance results that demonstrate the efficacy of the overall solution method employed to host the model. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

We sought to identify the frequency of NEC in very-low-birth-weight infants with isolated ventricular septal defects (VSDs) or atrial septal defects (ASDs) using a large multicenter database.STUDY DESIGN: We identified a cohort of infants with birth weight <1500 g cared for in 312 neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) managed by the Pediatrix Medical Group between 1997 and 2010. We examined the association between the presence of an ASD or a VSD with development of NEC using logistic regression to control for small-for-gestational age status, antenatal steroid use, antenatal antibiotic use, gestational age, sex, race, Apgar score at 5 min and method of delivery.RESULT: Of the 98 523 infants who met inclusion criteria, 1904 (1.9%) had an ASD, 1943 (2.0%) had a VSD and 146 (0.1%) had both. The incidence of NEC was 6.2% in infants without septal defects, 9.3% in those with an ASD, 7.8% in those with a VSD, and 10.3% in infants with both an ASD and a VSD. Compared with infants without septal defects, the adjusted odds ratios for developing NEC for each group-ASD alone, VSD alone and ASD with VSD-were 1.26 (95% confidence interval 1.07 to 1.49), 1.27 (1.07 to 1.51) and 1.79 (1.03 to 3.12), respectively.CONCLUSION: The presence of an ASD or a VSD was associated with NEC in this cohort of premature infants.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0743-8346	1476-5543		WOS:000333814200014	24434778

In Situ Production of Zoospores by Five Species of Phytophthora in Aqueous Environments for Use as Inocula								PLANT DISEASE				98	4			551	558		10.1094/PDIS-06-13-0591-RE			APR 2014	2014	The goal of this study was to develop a procedure that could be used to evaluate the potential susceptibility of aquatic plants used in constructed wetlands to species of Phytophthora commonly found in nurseries. V8 agar plugs from actively growing cultures of three or four isolates of Phytophthora cinnamomi, P. citrophthora, P. clyptogea, P. nicotianae, and P. palmivora were used to produce inocula. In a laboratory experiment, plugs were placed in plastic cups and covered with 1.5% nonsterile soil extract solution (SES) for 29 days, and zoospore presence and activity in the solution were monitored at 2- or 3-day intervals with a rhododendron leaf disk baiting bioassay. In a greenhouse experiment, plugs of each species of Phytophthora were placed in plastic pots and covered with either SES or Milli-Q water for 13 days during both summer and winter months, and zoospore presence in the solutions were monitored at 3-day intervals with the baiting bioassay and by filtration. Zoospores were present in solutions throughout the 29-day and 13-day experimental periods but consistency of zoospore release varied by species. In the laboratory experiment, colonization of leaf baits decreased over time for some species and often varied among isolates within a species. In the greenhouse experiment, bait colonization decreased over time in both summer and winter, varied among species of Phytophthora in the winter, and was better in Milli-Q water. Zoospore densities in solutions were greater in the summer than in the winter. Decreased zoospore activities for some species of Phytophthora were associated with prolonged temperatures below 13 or above 30 degrees C in the greenhouse. Zoospores from plugs were released consistently in aqueous solutions for at least 13 days. This procedure can be used to provide in situ inocula for the five species of Phytophthora used in this study so that aquatic plant species can be evaluated for potential susceptibility.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0191-2917	1943-7692		WOS:000333436700016

The most abundant component of RPE lipofuscin is N-retinylidene-N-retinylethanolamine (A2E) but its exact composition is not known due to the complexity of the RPE extract. In this study, we utilized MALDI imaging to find potential molecules responsible for lipofuscin fluorescence in RPE tissue from Abca4(-/-), Sv129, and C57Bl6/J mice aged 2 and 6 months. To assert relationships, the individual images in the MALDI imaging datasets were correlated with lipofuscin fluorescence recorded from the same tissues following proper registration. Spatial correlation information, which is usually lost in bioanalytics, pinpointed a relatively small number of potential lipofuscin components. The comparison of four samples in each condition further limited the possibility of false positives and provided various new, age- and strain-specific targets. Validating the usefulness of the fluorescence-enhanced imaging strategy, many known adducts of A2E were identified in the short list of lipofuscin components. These results provided evidence that mass spectrometric imaging can be utilized as a tool to begin to identify the molecular substructure of clinically-relevant diagnostic information.									11	0	0	8	0	11			1615-9853	1615-9861		WOS:000333691400014	24453194	
J	Vu, Hung T.; Klaine, Stephen J.								Testing the individual effective dose hypothesis								ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY				33	4			791	797		10.1002/etc.2488			APR 2014	2014	The assumption of the individual effective dose is the basis for the probit method used for analyzing dose or concentration-response data. According to this assumption, each individual has a uniquely innate tolerance expressed as the individual effective dose (IED) or the smallest dose that is sufficient to kill the individual. An alternative to IED, stochasticity suggests that individuals do not have uniquely innate tolerance; deaths result from random processes occurring among similar individuals. Although the probit method has been used extensively in toxicology, the underlying assumption has not been tested rigorously. The goal of the present study was to test which assumption, IED or stochasticity, best explained the response of Daphnia magna exposed to multiple pulses of copper sulfate (CuSO4) over 24 d. Daphnia magna were exposed to subsequent age-dependent 24-h median lethal concentrations (LC50s) of copper (Cu). Age-dependent 24-h LC50 values and Cu depuration test were determined prior to the 24-d bioassay. The LC50 values were inversely related to organism age. The Cu depuration of D. magna did not depend on age or Cu concentration, and 5 d was sufficient recovery time. Daphnia magna were exposed to 4 24-h Cu exposures, and surviving organisms after each exposure were transferred to Cu-free culture media for recovery before the next exposure. Stochasticity appropriately explained the survival and reproduction response of D. magna exposed to Cu. Environ Toxicol Chem 2014;33:791-797.

We tested the hypothesis that, in addition to loss of the telomeric gene SHANK3, specific genomic regions within 22q13 are associated with important clinical features.Methods: We used a customized oligo array comparative genomic hybridization of 22q12.3-terminus to obtain deletion breakpoints in a cohort of 70 patients with terminal 22q13 deletions. We used association and receiver operating characteristic statistical methods in a novel manner and also incorporated protein interaction networks to identify 22q13 genomic locations and genes associated with clinical features.Results: Specific genomic regions and candidate genes within 22q13.2q13.32 were associated with severity of speech/language delay, neonatal hypotonia, delayed age at walking, hair-pulling behaviors, male genital anomalies, dysplastic toenails, large/fleshy hands, macrocephaly, short and tall stature, facial asymmetry, and atypical reflexes: We also found regions suggestive of a negative association with autism spectrum disorders.Conclusion: This work advances the field of research beyond the observation of a correlation between deletion size and phenotype and identifies candidate 22q13 loci, and in some cases specific genes, associated with singular clinical features observed in Phelan-McDermid syndrome. Our statistical approach may be useful in genotype-phenotype analyses for other microdeletion or microduplication syndromes.									5	3	0	4	0	8			1098-3600	1530-0366		WOS:000333779600006	24136618

Structure-from-motion techniques are used to capture 3D point cloud models of an object in two different configurations. Procrustes analysis, combined with a locally optimized RANSAC sampling strategy, facilitates a straightforward geometric approach to recovering the joint axes, as well as classifying them automatically as either revolute or prismatic. With the resulting articulated model, a robotic system is then able to manipulate the object along its joint axes at a specified grasp point in order to exercise its degrees of freedom. Because the models capture all sides of the object, they are occlusion-aware, meaning that the robot has knowledge of parts of the object that are not visible in the current view. Our algorithm does not require prior knowledge of the object, nor does it make any assumptions about the planarity of the object or scene. Experiments with a PUMA 500 robotic arm demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on a variety of real-world objects containing both revolute and prismatic joints. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Batsch]								TREE GENETICS & GENOMES				10	2			367	381		10.1007/s11295-013-0692-y			APR 2014	2014	Blush is an important trait for marketing peaches. The red skin pigmentation develops through the flavonoid and anthocyanin pathways, and both genetic and environmental stimuli, and their interaction, control the regulation of these pathways. The molecular basis of blush development in peach is yet to be understood. An F-2 blush population (ZC(2)) derived from a cross between two peach cultivars with contrasting phenotypes for blush, "Zin Dai" (similar to 30 % red) and "Crimson Lady" (similar to 100 % red), was used for linkage map construction and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) mapping. The segregating population was phenotyped for blush for 4 years using a visual rating scale and quantified using a colorimeter (L*, a*, and b*) 1 year. The ZC(2) population was genotyped with the IPSC 9 K peach single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array v1, and a high-density ZC(2) genetic linkage map was constructed. The map covers genetic a distance of similar to 452.51 cM with an average marker spacing of 2.38 cM/marker. Four QTLs were detected: one major QTL on LG3 (Blush.Pp.ZC-3.1) and three minor QTLs on LG 4 and 7 (Blush.Pp.ZC-4.1; Blush.Pp.ZC-4.2; Blush.Pp.ZC-7.1), indicating the presence of major and minor genes involved in blush development. Candidate genes involved in skin and flesh coloration of peach (PprMYB10), cherry (PavMYB10), and apple (MdMYB1/MdMYBA/MdMYB10) are located within the interval of the major QTL on LG3, suggesting the same genetic control for color development in the Rosaceae family. Marker-assisted selection (MAS) for blush is discussed.									13	0	0	12	0	13			1614-2942	1614-2950		WOS:000333261100013

The sulfate resistance of these mixtures in terms of expansion and loss of compressive strength was determined using the standard test method.. The water to cementitious material (w/cm) ratio and RHA dosage in the mortars was varied from 0.40 to 0.57 and 0 to 15% (by mass), respectively. The results from this investigation suggest that all mortars with a w/cm ratio of 0.40 showed little deterioration, indicating their high sulfate resistance. For mortars with a w/cm ratio of 0.48 and 0.57, the control mortars showed more deterioration than those with RHA. For mortars at any given w/cm ratio, the sulfate resistance decreased with an increase in the RHA dosage. Though both sodium and magnesium sulfates caused significant deterioration in the specimens, the former caused increased expansions in the test specimens while the latter caused significant loss in compressive strength. The sulfate resistance of RHA mortars was comparable with that of silica fume mortars.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0899-1561	1943-5533		WOS:000332768900004

Reflexive photography is an innovative qualitative research technique that examines participants' interactions with their environment through their personal reflections on images that they captured during their experience. Design: A purposive sample of 10 baccalaureate nursing students traveled to Guatemala, where they conducted family and community assessments, engaged in home visits, and provided health education. Data collection involved over 100 photographs and a personal interview with each student. Findings: The themes developed from the photographs and interviews provided insight into the activities of an international experience that influence the cognitive, practical, and affective learning of cultural competence. Conclusions: Making home visits and teaching others from a different culture increased students' transcultural self-efficacy. Implications: Reflexive photography is a more robust method of self-reflection, especially for visual learners.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1043-6596	1552-7832		WOS:000333038500011	24504071

The a posteriori tracking of requirement dependencies is a well-established practice in project and change management. The identification of these dependencies often requires manual input by one or more individuals with intimate knowledge of the project. Moreover, the definition of these dependencies that help to predict requirement change is not currently found in the literature. This paper presents two industry case studies of predicting system requirement change propagation through three approaches: manually, linguistically, and bag-of-words. Dependencies are manually and automatically developed between requirements from textual data and computationally processed to develop surrogate models to predict change. Two types of relationship generation, manual keyword selection and part-of-speech tagging, are compared. Artificial neural networks are used to create surrogate models to predict change. These approaches are evaluated on three connectedness metrics: shortest path, path count, and maximum flow rate. The results are given in terms of search depth needed within a requirements document to identify the subsequent changes. The semi-automated approach yielded the most accurate results, requiring a search depth of 11 %, but sacrifices on automation. The fully automated approach is able to predict requirement change within a search depth of 15 % and offers the benefits of full minimal human input.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0934-9839	1435-6066		WOS:000333239800005

Specifically, this article focuses on describing gravity currents occurring at both the bottom boundary and the free surface of the receiving fluid. The manmade discharge operations generating both types of gravity currents and their significance to sustainability of the surrounding hydro-environment are first described. The authors then summarize the flow regimes characteristics of these discharges before becoming gravity currents and how those flow regimes influence the dynamics of the gravity currents. The gravity current dynamics in the calm receiving waters are then analyzed. This analysis is followed by an analysis of the influence of the hydrodynamic forces (e.g., currents, turbulence, waves) on the dynamics of gravity currents. Finally, the authors review quantitative modeling approaches for different forms of gravity current, and identify the current knowledge gaps and research needs.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1567-7419	1573-1510		WOS:000332949300002

Turbulent entrainment into fluid mud gravity currents								ENVIRONMENTAL FLUID MECHANICS				14	2	SI		541	563		10.1007/s10652-014-9344-5			APR 2014	2014	The entrainment of ambient water into non-Newtonian fluid mud gravity currents was investigated in this study. Constant volume release gravity currents were generated in a lock-exchange tank for a wide range of experimental conditions. A technique similar to the so-called light attenuation technique was used to find the boundary of the current, allowing for the calculation of both temporal and bulk entrainment parameters (in terms of the temporal and bulk entrainment velocities, respectively). It was found that the temporal entrainment velocity is dependent on different parameters in the different propagation phases. The slumping phase begins with an adjustment zone (henceforth, non-established zone) in which the temporal entrainment velocity is not a function of the current front velocity, followed by the established zone in which the temporal entrainment velocity is a function of the current front velocity. This dependence of the temporal entrainment velocity on the current front velocity carries through to the inertia-buoyancy phase. As expected, temporal entrainment velocity in the viscous-buoyancy phase was negligible in comparison to average entrainment velocity in the other phases. It is observed that the temporal entrainment characteristics in the non-established zone is governed by the competition between the entrainment-inhibiting density stratification effects and the entrainment-favouring effects of the Kelvin-Helmholtz billows that are quantified by the Richardson number and the Reynolds number of the gravity current, respectively. In the established zone, Reynolds number effects were observed to dominate over Richardson number effects in dictating temporal entrainment characteristics. A parameterization for the temporal entrainment velocity for non-Newtonian fluid mud gravity currents is developed based upon the experimental observations. This study also found that the bulk entrainment characteristics for the non-Newtonian fluid mud gravity currents can be parameterized by the Newtonian bulk entrainment parameterizations that rely solely on a bulk Richardson number. Interestingly, it was found that the non-Newtonian characteristics of the gravity current have little to no effect on the entrainment of the Newtonian ambient fluid.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1567-7419	1573-1510		WOS:000332949300014

Priority dispatching strategies for EMS systems								JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY				65	4	SI		572	587		10.1057/jors.2013.95			APR 2014	2014	Emergency medical service (EMS) systems provide urgent medical care and transport. In this study we implement dispatching policies for EMS systems that incorporate the severity of the call in order to increase the survival probability of patients. A simulation model is developed to evaluate the performance of EMS systems. Performance is measured in terms of patients' survival probability, since survival probability more directly mirrors patient outcomes. Different response strategies are evaluated utilizing several examples to study the nature of the optimal dispatching policy. The results show that dispatching the closest vehicle is not always optimal and dispatching vehicles considering priority of the call leads to an increase in the average survival probability of patients. A heuristic algorithm, that is easy to implement, is developed to dispatch ambulances for large-scale EMS systems. Computational examples show that the dispatching algorithm is valuable in increasing the patients' survival probability.									5	0	0	0	1	6			0160-5682	1476-9360		WOS:000332947600008

Their energy density can be increased using ionic liquids and electrodes with subnanometre pores, but this tends to reduce their power density and compromise the key advantage of supercapacitors. To help address this issue through material optimization, here we unravel the mechanisms of charging subnanometre pores with ionic liquids using molecular dynamics simulations, navigated by a phenomenological model. We show that charging of ionophilic pores is a diffusive process, often accompanied by overfilling followed by de-filling. In sharp contrast to conventional expectations, charging is fast because ion diffusion during charging can be an order of magnitude faster than in the bulk, and charging itself is accelerated by the onset of collective modes. Further acceleration can be achieved using ionophobic pores by eliminating overfilling/ de-filling and thus leading to charging behaviour qualitatively different from that in conventional, ionophilic pores.									68	2	0	5	0	68			1476-1122	1476-4660		WOS:000333397100024	24651430

Control of the disease in commercial fields is largely dependent on the application of fungicides, including the dicarboximide iprodione. Single-spore isolates were collected from strawberry fields in Florida, North Carolina, and South Carolina and subjected to an assay using conidial germination that distinguished sensitive (S) isolates from isolates with various levels of resistance to iprodione. Of the 245 isolates, 1 was highly resistant (HR), 5 were moderately resistant (MR), and 43 had low resistance (LR) to iprodione. LR and MR strains were found in the Florida population and in 9 of 11 locations from North Carolina and South Carolina, indicating that resistance was widespread but accounted for only a relatively small percentage of the B. cinerea population. Sequence analysis of the target gene bos1, which codes for a class III histidine kinase, revealed that the MR phenotype was associated with Q369P and N373S mutations and that the LR phenotype was associated with either a I365S or a I365N mutation. The I365S and I365N mutations were also present in five additionally included HR isolates from North Carolina and South Carolina blackberry fields and one HR isolate from a Virginia strawberry field but no mutation or mutation combinations in bos1 were uniquely associated with the HR phenotype. Expression analysis of bos1 in S and HR isolates did not reveal convincing evidence of the gene's involvement in HR resistance either. The six HR isolates had three different phenotypes with respect to their sensitivity to fludioxonil; two were S, two were LR, and two were MR. The fludioxonil LR and MR isolates were also resistant to tolnaftate, an indication of multidrug efflux pump activity. These data suggest that, in addition to point mutations in bos1, drug efflux pump activity and potentially a third mechanism of resistance may be contributing to the iprodione HR phenotype. Detached fruit studies showed that field rates of Rovral 4 Flowable (iprodione) did not control iprodione MR and HR isolates.									17	1	0	16	0	18			0031-949X	1943-7684		WOS:000332850900009	24156554

Eighteen extension agents, researchers, consultants, and farmers provided feedback about decision support tools that utilize such forecasts during focus groups that were conducted in Florence, South Carolina on January 14, 2011. Climate Risk and County Yield Database were the tools most selected as potentially useful for agricultural extension in South Carolina. An irrigation scheduler was the most frequently mentioned tool to be developed. Also, a survey of Clemson University's extension personnel was conducted in January and February 2011 to assess interest of South Carolina's growers and producers in using climate forecasts, eleven potential uses of climate forecasts by extension's clientele, and potential usefulness to extensionists of twelve specific forecasts. Clemson's extensionists represent approximately 97 % of the state's agricultural extensionists. They are more likely than not to agree that growers and producers are interested in using climate forecasts. Most of the state's extension personnel also think that farmers could use a climate forecast to improve irrigation management and planting schedules. A majority of the state's extensionists thinks that a freeze alert could be useful to them and the proportion that thinks the forecast could be useful exceeds the proportion that thinks any other forecast could be useful. Most extensionists also think that a forecast of plant moisture stress could be useful to help farmers schedule irrigation. The key survey results are remarkably similar to those from surveys of extension personnel at North Carolina State University in early 2009 and University of Florida in late 2004.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1436-3798	1436-378X		WOS:000333267700017

Limited acetylation of lignin hydroxyl groups enabled dry-spinning of the precursor using acetone (solvent) followed by thermo-oxidative stabilization. Resulting carbon fibers (similar to 7 mu m diameter) displayed a tensile modulus, strength, and strain-to-failure values of 52 +/- 2 GPa, 1.04 +/- 0.10 GPa, and 2.0 +/- 0.2%, respectively. Because of solvent diffusion during dry-spinning, fibers displayed a crenulated surface that can provide a larger specific interfacial area for enhanced fiber/matrix bonding in composite applications.

Hydrogenophaga carboriunda sp nov., a Tertiary Butyl Alcohol-Oxidizing, Psychrotolerant Aerobe Derived from Granular-Activated Carbon (GAC)								CURRENT MICROBIOLOGY				68	4			510	517		10.1007/s00284-013-0501-8			APR 2014	2014	A Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium was isolated from a mixed culture that degraded tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) in a granular-activated carbon (GAC) sample from a Biological-GAC reactor. Strain YZ2(T) was assigned to the Betaproteobacteria within the family Comamonadaceae based on 16S rRNA gene similarities. The nearest phylogenetic relative (95.0 % similarity) with a valid name was Hydrogenophaga taeniospiralis. The DNA G+C content was 66.4 mol%. DNA:DNA hybridization indicated that the level of relatedness to members of the genus Hydrogenophaga ranged from 1.1 to 10.8 %. The dominant cellular fatty acids were: 18:1 w7c (75 %), 16:0 (4.9 %), 17:0 (3.85 %), 18:0 (2.93 %), 11 methyl 18:1 w7c (2.69 %), Summed Feature 2 (2.27 %), and 18:0 3OH (1.35 %). The primary substrate used was TBA, which is a fuel oxygenate and groundwater contaminant. YZ2(T) was non-motile, without apparent flagella. It is a psychrotolerant, facultative aerobe that grew between pH 6.5 and 9.5, and 4 and 30 A degrees C. The culture grew on and mineralized TBA at 4 A degrees C, which is the first report of psychrotolerant TBA degradation. Hydrogen was used as an alternative electron donor. The culture also grew well in defined freshwater medium with ethanol, butanol, hydroxy isobutyric acid, acetate, pyruvate, citrate, lactate, isopropanol, and benzoic acid as electron donors. Nitrate was reduced with hydrogen as the sole electron donor. On the basis of morphological, physiological, and chemotaxonomic data, a new species, Hydrogenophaga carboriunda is proposed, with YZ2(T) as the type strain.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0343-8651	1432-0991		WOS:000331006200013	24343174

The average reduction of E. coli O157:H7 was greater than that of L. monocytogenes and higher concentrations of either protease yielded greater reduction in bacterial populations. For instance, actinidin at 700 mg/ml significantly (p <= 0.05) reduced the population of L monocytogenes by 1.49 log cfu/ml meat rinse after 3 h at 25 & 35 degrees C, and by 1.45 log cfu/ml rinse after 24 h at 5 degrees C, while the same actinidin concentration significantly reduced the populations of three mixed strains of E. coli O157:H7 by 1.81 log cfu/ml rinse after 3 h at 25 & 35 degrees C, and 1.94 log cfu/ml rinse after 24 h at 5 degrees C. These findings suggest that, in addition to improving the sensory attributes of beef, proteolytic enzymes can enhance meat safety when stored at suitable temperatures. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Wang, Min; Sun, Xiaoqian					Wang, Min/0000-0002-9233-7844			Bayes factor consistency for nested linear models with a growing number of parameters								JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE				147				95	105		10.1016/j.jspi.2013.11.001			APR 2014	2014	In this paper, we consider the Bayesian approach to the model selection problem for nested linear regression models. Common Bayesian procedures to this problem are based on Zellner's g-prior with a hyper-prior for the scaling factor g. Maruyama and George (2011) recently adopted this procedure with the beta-prime distribution for g and derived an explicit closed-form Bayes factor without integral representation which is thus easy to compute. In addition, they have studied its corresponding model selection consistency for fixed number of parameters. Over recent years, linear regression models with a growing number of unknown parameters have gained increased popularity in practical applications, such as the clustering problem. This observation motivates us to further investigate the consistency of Bayes factor with the beta-prime distribution for g under a scenario in which the number of parameters increases with the sample size. Finally, the results presented here are compared with the ones for the Bayes factor under intrinsic priors in relevant literature. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Janzen, Daron/0000-0002-5584-1961			Cyclometallated gold(III) complexes with a trithiacrown ligand: Solventless Au(III) cyclometallation, intramolecular gold-sulfur interactions, and fluxional behavior in 1,4,7-trithiacyclononane Au(III) complexes								JOURNAL OF ORGANOMETALLIC CHEMISTRY				755				47	57		10.1016/j.jorganchem.2013.12.048			APR 1 2014	2014	We report the synthesis and characterization for several gold(III) complexes involving a series of cyclometallating ligands. These cyclometallating ligands (CN) are: 2-phenylpyridine (ppy), 2-(p-tolyl) pyridine (tpy), 2-(2'-benzothienyl)pyridine (btp) and 7,8-benzoquinoline (bzq). With the assistance of TGA data, we have developed solventless reactions to prepare the neutral cyclometallated Au(III) dichloro complexes. Reaction of these with the crown trithioether [9]aneS(3) (1,4,7-trithiacyclononane), followed by metathesis with NH4PF6, yields the heteroleptic complexes [Au([9]aneS(3))(CN)](PF6)(2). The X-ray structures of the gold(III) [9]aneS(3) complexes display axial Au-S interactions formed by the endodentate conformation of the thiacrown, resulting in elongated square pyramidal geometries. The Au-S axial distance correlates with the electron-donating properties of the CN ligand with the better donating btp showing the longest distance (2.855(1) angstrom) while the ppy shows the shortest (2.818(1) angstrom). The coordinated 9]aneS(3) ligand shows fluxional behavior by its NMR spectroscopy, resulting in a single C-13 NMR resonance despite the asymmetric coordination environment of the cyclometallating ligand. Electrochemical studies of the [9]aneS(3) complexes reveal irreversible one-electron reductions which are assigned as a Au(III)/Au(II) couple. The ease of reduction correlates with the axial Au-S distances with the btp being the easiest to reduce and the ppy the most difficult. In addition, we report the crystal structures for three intermediate complexes: [Au(H-tpy)Cl-3], [Au(H-btp)Cl-3], and [Au(btp)Cl-2]. The [Au(H-btp)Cl-3] complex shows an interesting Au-S axial interaction at 3.139(2) angstrom which alters the physicochemical properties of the complex. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

An (a(1), a(2),..., a(k))-packing coloring of a graph G is a mapping from V (G) to {1, 2,..., k} such that vertices with color i have pairwise distance greater than a. In this paper, we study (a(1), a(2),..., a(k))-packing colorings of several lattices including the infinite square, triangular, and hexagonal lattices. For k small, we determine all a(1) such that these graphs have packing colorings. We also give some exact values and asymptotic bounds. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J	Battiato, Ilenia								Effective medium theory for drag-reducing micro-patterned surfaces in turbulent flows								EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL E				37	3					19	10.1140/epje/i2014-14019-0			MAR 28 2014	2014	Many studies in the last decade have revealed that patterns at the microscale can reduce skin drag. Yet, the mechanisms and parameters that control drag reduction, e.g. Reynolds number and pattern geometry, are still unclear. We propose an effective medium representation of the micro-features, that treats the latter as a porous medium, and provides a framework to model turbulent flow over patterned surfaces. Our key result is a closed-form expression for the skin friction coefficient in terms of frictional Reynolds (or Karman) number in turbulent regime, the viscosity ratio between the fluid in and above the features, and their geometrical properties. We apply the proposed model to turbulent flows over superhydrophobic ridged surfaces. The model predictions agree with laboratory experiments for Reynolds numbers ranging from 3000 to 10000.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1292-8941	1292-895X		WOS:000333522000001	24671449

In this review we examine current biological resources for the study of this genus, with an emphasis on detailing the history of extant colonies and cell lines derived from C sonorensis, the major vector of BTV in the USA. We then discuss the rapidly developing area of genomic and transcriptomic analyses of biological processes in vectors and introduce the newly formed Culicoides Genomics and Transcriptomics Alliance. Preliminary results from these fields are detailed and finally likely areas of future research are discussed from an entomological perspective describing limitations in our understanding of Culicoides biology that may impede progress in these areas.

J	Li, H.; Yu, Y.; Li, G.								Computational modeling and analysis of thermoelectric properties of nanoporous silicon								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS				115	12					124316	10.1063/1.4869734			MAR 28 2014	2014	In this paper, thermoelectric properties of nanoporous silicon are modeled and studied by using a computational approach. The computational approach combines a quantum non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) coupled with the Poisson equation for electrical transport analysis, a phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) for phonon thermal transport analysis and the Wiedemann-Franz law for calculating the electronic thermal conductivity. By solving the NEGF/Poisson equations self-consistently using a finite difference method, the electrical conductivity sigma and Seebeck coefficient S of the material are numerically computed. The BTE is solved by using a finite volume method to obtain the phonon thermal conductivity k(p) and the Wiedemann-Franz law is used to obtain the electronic thermal conductivity k(e). The figure of merit of nanoporous silicon is calculated by ZT = S-2 sigma T/(k(p) + k(e)). The effects of doping density, porosity, temperature, and nanopore size on thermoelectric properties of nanoporous silicon are investigated. It is confirmed that nanoporous silicon has significantly higher thermoelectric energy conversion efficiency than its nonporous counterpart. Specifically, this study shows that, with a n-type doping density of 10(20) cm(-3), a porosity of 36% and nanopore size of 3 nm x 3 nm, the figure of merit ZT can reach 0.32 at 600 K. The results also show that the degradation of electrical conductivity of nanoporous Si due to the inclusion of nanopores is compensated by the large reduction in the phonon thermal conductivity and increase of absolute value of the Seebeck coefficient, resulting in a significantly improved ZT.

This work demonstrates that Y-doped complex-perovskite-structured Ba3Ca1.18Nb1.82-xYxO9-delta materials possess both improved proton conductivity and exceptional chemical 0:9 stability. Neutron powder diffraction refinement revealed a Fm (3) over barm perovskite-structure and increased oxygen vacancy concentration due to the Y doping. High-resolution TEM analysis confirmed the perturbation of the B site cation ordering in the structure for the Ba3Ca1.18Nb1.82-xYxO9-delta materials. Such combined effects led to improved proton conductivity with a value of 5.3 x 10(-3) S cm(-1) at 600 degrees C for Ba3Ca1.18Nb1.52Y0.3O9-delta (BCNY0.3), a value 2.4 times higher compared with that of the undoped Ba3Ca1.18Nb1.82O9-delta. The Ba3Ca1.18Nb1.82-xYxO9-delta materials showed remarkable chemical stability toward water and demonstrated no observable reactions to CO2 exposure. Ionic transport number studies showed that BCNY0.3 had predominantly proton conduction below 600 degrees C. Solid oxide fuel cells using BCNY0.3 as an electrolyte demonstrated cell power output of 103 mW cm(-2) at 750 degrees C. These results suggest that a doping strategy that tailors the cation ordering in complex perovskites provides a new direction in the search for novel proton conducting ceramics.									13	0	0	1	0	13			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000333539300007

These magnetic nanocapsules, consisting of a stable iron nanocore and a mesoporous silica shell, were synthesized by controlled encapsulation of ellipsoidal hematite in silica, partial etching of the hematite core in acid, and reduction of the core by hydrogen. The iron core provided a high saturation magnetization and was stable against oxidation for at least 6 months in air and 1 month in aqueous solution. The hollow space between the iron core and mesoporous silica shell was used to load anticancer drug and a T-1-weighted MM contrast agent (Gd-DTPA). These multifunctional monodispersed magnetic "nanoeyes" were coated by multiple polyelectrolyte layers of biocompatible poly-L-lysine and sodium alginate to control the drug release as a function of pH. We studied pH-controlled release, magnetic hysteresis curves, and T-1/T-2 MRI contrast of the magnetic nanoeyes. They also served as MM contrast agents with relaxivities of 8.6 mM(-1) s(-1) (r(1)) and 285 mM(-1) s(-1) (r(2)).									30	1	0	3	0	31			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000333539300016	24748722

Development of multimodal membrane adsorbers for antibody purification using atom transfer radical polymerization								POLYMER				55	6			1404	1411		10.1016/j.polymer.2013.12.023			MAR 24 2014	2014	This contribution describes a graft polymerization strategy to prepare multimodal membranes, a new class of high-productivity adsorptive materials for the purification of therapeutic proteins. Surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization was used to graft poly(glycidyl methacrylate) 'tentacles' from the pore surfaces of macroporous regenerated cellulose membranes. Subsequently, 4-mercaptobenzoic acid was coupled to the membranes by an epoxide ring-opening reaction. ATR-FTIR measurements support successful ligand incorporation. Graft polymerization studies from cellulose-coated silicon substrates were done in parallel to measure the thickness evolution of the polymer coating, which plays an important role on protein binding capacities. Protein binding experiments with bovine immunoglobulin G show that the multimodal membranes have high equilibrium capacities, up to 150 mg IgG/mL. The binding capacities are pH-dependent, with maximum binding at pH near the protein isoelectric point. Characteristic of multimodal adsorbers, the membranes retain about 70% of their equilibrium binding capacity at moderate ionic strength (300 mM) and about 40% at high ionic strength (1.6 M).

CO2 plasticization and physical aging of perfluorocyclobutyl polymer selective layers								JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE				454				398	406		10.1016/j.memsci.2013.12.044			MAR 15 2014	2014	Carbon dioxide plasticization and physical aging are two phenomena that occur in glassy polymers that limit their effectiveness as selective layers in composite gas separation membranes. These two phenomena become more significant in polymeric thin films, which presents challenges for the longterm, stable operation of thin-film composite membranes. The objective of this work was to study CO2 plasticization and physical aging of perfluorocyclobutyl (PFCB) polymer thin film selective layers ( < 100 um), which are new to the membrane art. Specifically, measurements on PFCB polymer selective layers were conducted to evaluate the influence of film processing conditions (PFCB concentration and coating speed), aging time and heat treatments on CO2 plasticization pressure. Findings indicate that PFCB layer thickness plays an important role on plasticization resistance when the thickness is less than 40 nm. However, when the thickness is greater than 40 nm, concentration of the coating solution also played an important role. Using concentrations above the overlap concentration yielded films with higher plasticization pressure compared to films with similar thickness prepared from dilute solution. Findings also show that films annealed at higher temperature exhibited higher plasticization pressure. Long-term CO2 exposure studies indicated that CO2 plasticization lessens the impact that physical aging has on permeability loss during the early stage of use, but at longer times, CO2 plasticization accelerates physical aging. Overall, results presented in this work contribute new understanding of plasticization and physical aging, and may be used to guide further improvements in polymer performance for CO2 separations.

MnTe1-xSx samples with nominal S content of x = 0.00, 0.05, and 0.10 were prepared using a melt-quench method followed by pulverization and spark plasma sintering. The X-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and ZAF-corrected compositional analysis confirmed that S uniformly substitutes Te up to slightly over 2%. A higher content of S in the starting materials led to the formation of secondary phases. The thermoelectric properties of MnTe1-xSx samples were characterized by means of Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, and thermal conductivity measurements from 300K to 773K. Furthermore, Hall coefficient measurements and a single parabolic band model were used to help gain insights on the effects of S-doping on the scattering mechanism and the carrier effective mass. As expected, S doping not only introduced hole charge carriers but also created short-range defects that effectively scatter heat-carrying phonons at elevated temperatures. On the other hand, we found that S doping degraded the effective mass. As a result, the ZT of MnTe0.9S0.1 was substantially enhanced over the pristine sample near 400 K, while the improvement of ZT became marginal at elevated temperatures. A ZT similar to 0.65 at 773K was obtained in all three samples. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0021-8979	1089-7550		WOS:000333083100036

Proceedings of SPIE--the International Society for Optical Engineering				8949										2014-Mar-12	2014	FINCHSCOPE is a new technology of fluorescence holographic microscopy. It has been successfully applied to recording high-resolution three-dimensional fluorescence images of biological specimens without the need for scanning. In this study, we revealed and analyzed an intrinsic phenomenon, called ghost lens effect, on spatial light modulator which is the core element enabling the incoherent correlation in the FINCHSCOPE. The ghost lens effect can degrade the imaging quality by introducing multiple spherical waves with different focal lengths into the correlation and thus increasing the noise in the recorded holograms.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0277-786X			MEDLINE:25767693	25767693

Sr 3d XPS spectra from unreduced polycrystalline SBN100x with various compositions contained two distinct spin-orbit doublets corresponding to Sr occupying either A1 or A2 positions in the SBN lattice; the higher binding energy state was associated with Sr ions at A2 sites, presumably due to their increased coordination over Sr at A1 sites. To gain insight into optimizing the thermoelectric properties of reduced SBN, sintered SBN50 specimens were reduced in Ar/H-2 or N-2/H-2 ambient. A decrease in the average Nb valence was observed in Nb 3d photoemission through the growth of low-binding energy components after reduction in either environment; evidence of surface NbN formation was apparent with longer reducing times in N-2/H-2. Both the single-component Ba 3d emission and the A2 component of the Sr 3d spectra show shifting to lower binding energy as the reduction time is increased, supporting the hypothesis of preferential oxygen vacancy formation adjacent to A2 sites. X-ray diffraction patterns revealed the formation of NbO2 in both reducing environments; in the case of extended reduction in N-2/H-2, NbO2 is gradually converted to NbN phases. Given the known properties of metallic NbN and semiconducting NbO2, the findings obtained here may be used to maximize the thermoelectric performance of SBN via the fabrication of composite structures containing both NbO2 and NbN.

While CO, H2O, [C II], and SO lines trace the envelope and the outflowing gas up to velocities of 33 km s(-1) with respect to systemic, the CN 5-4 hyperfine structure lines at 566.7, 566.9 GHz show a narrow double-peaked profile centered at systemic velocity, consistent with an origin in the outer region of the compact disk of T Tau N. Disk modeling of the T Tau N disk with the thermo-chemical code ProDiMo produces CN line fluxes and profiles consistent with the observed ones and constrain the size of the gaseous disk (R-out = 110(-20)(+10) AU) and its inclination (i = 25 degrees +/- 5 degrees). The model indicates that the CN lines originate in a disk upper layer at 40-110 AU from the star, which is irradiated by the stellar UV field and heated up to temperatures of 50-700 K. With respect to previously observed CN 2-1 millimeter lines, the CN 5-4 lines appear to be less affected by envelope emission, due to their larger critical density and excitation temperature. Hence, high-J CN lines are a unique confusion-free tracer of embedded disks, such as the disk of T Tau N.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2041-8205	2041-8213		WOS:000332516300002

The theory is proposed because, as we show from previous arguments in the literature, the standard Newtonian semiclassical gravity theory based on the Schroedinger-Newton equations does not have a consistent Born rule probability interpretation for gravitationally self-interacting particles and implies gravitational cat states for macroscopic mass superpositions. By contrast, we show that GRWmN has a consistent statistical description of gravitationally self-interacting particles and adequately suppresses the cat states for macroscopic superpositions. Two possible routes to experimentally testing GRWmN are also considered. We conclude with a discussion of possible variants of GRWmN, what a general relativistic extension would involve, and various objections that might be raised against semiclassical gravity theories like GRWmN.

A wide range of ligands such as alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, allyl, vinyl, 1-alkynyl, and alkoxy ligands were transferred, while a thiolate ligand afforded 1,6-regioselectivity. The reactions were successfully carried out on delta-alkyl- or aryl-substituted alpha,beta,gamma,delta-diunsaturated nitrodiene substrates. Regioselectivity is minimally influenced by temperature or choice of solvent.									4	0	0	2	0	4			1523-7060	1523-7052		WOS:000332756400023	24552443

Supported by the discourses of individualism, marketization, national governance, and competition, this (re)shaping of governance presents a specific dilemma for the political identity of educational leaders. In response to the troubling lack of international scholarship focused on the political role of educational leaders, this article provides insight into the ways in which the political identity of school leaders within the USA is influenced by dominant discourses. The understandings highlight the ways in which educational leaders are expected to realize their roles as resolute implementers of state policy, while also being directed to act as deliberative advocates within the jurisdiction of educational policy making.

The purpose of this article is to provide the field of the politics of educational with a concept that may expose the double bind that is experienced by the educational leaders.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0159-6306	1469-3739		WOS:000334061500010		
J	Gomez, Angela C.; Yamaguchi, Naohiro								Two Regions of the Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Channel Are Involved in Ca2+-Dependent Inactivation								BIOCHEMISTRY				53	8			1373	1379		10.1021/bi401586h			MAR 4 2014	2014	Skeletal (RyR1) and cardiac muscle (RyR2) isoforms of ryanodine receptor calcium channels are inhibited by millimollar Ca2+, but the affinity of RyR2 for inhibitory Ca2+ is similar to 10 times lower than that of RyR1. Previous studies demonstrated that the C-terminal quarter of RyR has critical domain(s) for Ca2+ inactivation. To obtain further insights into the molecular basis of regulation of RyRs by Ca2+, we constructed and expressed 18 RyR1--RyR2 chimeras in HEK293 cells and determined the Ca2+ activation and inactivation affinities of these channels using the [H-3]-ryanodine binding assay. Replacing two distinct regions of RyR1 with corresponding RyR2 sequences reduced the affinity for Ca2+ inactivation. The first region (RyR2 amino acids 4020-4250) contains two EF-hand Ca2+ binding motifs (EF1, amino acids 4036-4047; EF2, amino acids 4071-4082), and the second region includes the putative second transmembrane segment (S2). A RyR1-backbone chimera containing only EF2 from RyR2 had a modest (not significant) change in Ca2+ inactivation, whereas another chimera channel carrying only EF1 from RyR2 had a significantly reduced level of Ca2+ inactivation. The results suggest that EF1 is a more critical determinant for RyR inactivation by Ca2+. In addition, activities of the chimera carrying RyR2 EF-hands were suppressed at 10-100 mu M Ca2+, and the suppression was relieved by 1 mM Mg2+. The same effects have been observed with wild-type RyR2. A mutant RyR1 carrying both regions replaced with RyR2 sequences (amino acids 4020-4250 and 4560-4618) showed a Ca2+ inactivation affinity comparable to that of RyR2, indicating that these regions are sufficient to confer RyR2-type Ca2+-dependent inactivation on RyR1.									6	0	0	6	0	6			0006-2960			WOS:000332494300014	24521037	
J	Sparks, John R.; Siemens, Jennifer Christie								Judgment Difficulty and the Moral Intensity of Unethical Acts: A Cognitive Response Analysis of Dual Process Ethical Judgment Formation								ETHICS & BEHAVIOR				24	2			151	163		10.1080/10508422.2013.826133			MAR 4 2014	2014	This study analyzes cognitive responses to explore a dual processing perspective of ethical judgment formation. Specifically, the study investigates how two factors, judgment task difficulty and moral intensity, influence the extent of deontological and teleological processing and their effects on ethical judgments. A single experiment on 110 undergraduate research participants found that judgment task difficulty affected the extent of deontological and teleological processing. Although moral intensity affected ethical judgments, it did not produce effects on either deontological or teleological cognitive responses. Results did not support the hypotheses that deontological and teleological cognitive responses would mediate the relationships between the experimental factors and ethical judgments. Overall, the results support continued research of factors that affect the nature of information processing in ethical decision situations and the use of cognitive response analysis as a tool for conducting this research.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1050-8422	1532-7019		WOS:000330163700004		
J	Peebles, E. D.; Pulikanti, R.; Zhai, W.; Gerard, P. D.								Relationships of incubational hatching egg characteristics to posthatch body weight and processing yield in Ross x Ross 708 broilers								JOURNAL OF APPLIED POULTRY RESEARCH				23	1			34	40		10.3382/japr.2013-00784			MAR 2014	2014	The characteristics of broiler hatching eggs have the potential to effect broiler posthatch growth and processing yield. The association of set egg weight (SEW), length of incubation (LI), and mean daily percentage of incubational weight loss (MDPEWL) of embryonated Ross x Ross 708 broiler hatching eggs with subsequent posthatch BW and processing yield was investigated. Sixty Ross x Ross 708 broiler hatching eggs were randomly set on each of 8 replicate tray levels of an incubator. Weight loss of individual embryonated eggs between 0 and 10.5, 10.5 and 18.5, and 0 and 18.5 d of incubation was determined for the calculation of MDPEWL. Furthermore, on 18.5 d of incubation, embryonated eggs were transferred to a hatcher unit where they were individually monitored for hatch every 12 h for determination of LI. Chicks were placed in corresponding replicate floor pens and were grown out from 0 (21.5 d of incubation) to 49 d posthatch. Live bird BW as a percentage of SEW on 21.0 d of incubation and d 0 and 49 posthatch, and bird sex on d 49 posthatch were determined. After commercial processing, carcass weight as a percentage of SEW, and carcass, abdominal fat pad, wings, breast muscle, tenders, drumsticks, and thighs weights as percentages of live BW were determined. Bird BW on 21.0 d of incubation and on d 0 and 49 posthatch were positively correlated or interrelated with SEW. Between 0 and 10.5 d of incubation, MDPEWL was negatively correlated with absolute and relative BW on 21.0 d of incubation, absolute BW on d 0 posthatch, and relative tenders weight. Further, LI was positively correlated with absolute and relative BW on 21.0 d of incubation and d 0 posthatch, but was negatively correlated with relative (percentage of live BW) carcass weight on d 49 posthatch. The MDPEWL of modern strain broiler hatching eggs should be closely monitored, particularly during the first half of incubation, for the regulation of LI and hatchling BW and for their potential effects on processing yield characteristics.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1056-6171	1537-0437		WOS:000337352700005

Comparison of details for controlling end-region cracks in precast, pretensioned concrete I-girders								PCI JOURNAL								96	108					SPR 2014	2014	This paper reports on a study comparing four detailing schemes for controlling end-region web-splitting cracks: end reinforcement per AASHTO LRFD specifications, large-diameter end reinforcement, vertical end-region posttensioning, and partial debonding of 45% of prestressing strands. Crack locations, lengths, and widths in 63 in. (1600 mm) deep Florida I-beams (FIB-63) were monitored during transfer and in the months following prestress transfer. Crack data were quantified and compared to determine the relative effectiveness of each scheme in controlling web cracking. Specimens were then load tested to determine the effect of each scheme on ultimate capacity. All three modified details resulted in reduced web cracking compared with the standard detail.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0887-9672			WOS:000342612600008

Via in-depth interviews with village leaders, household farmers, and large farm operators in modern, transitional, and traditional communes in the north of Vietnam, we explored behaviors, attitudes, cultural values, and traditions that might amplify or attenuate HPAI outbreaks. We also explored conceptualizations of urbanization and its impacts on animal husbandry and disease outbreaks. Qualitative theme analyses identified the key impacts, factors related to HPAI outbreaks, and disease prevention and management strategies. The analyses also highlighted how urbanization improves some aspects of life (e.g., food security, family wealth and health, more employment opportunities, and improved infrastructure), but simultaneously poses significant challenges for poultry farming and disease management. Awareness of qualitative aspects of HPAI risk perceptions and behaviors and how they vary with urbanization processes may help to improve the prevention and management of emerging infectious diseases.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1612-9202	1612-9210		WOS:000337076000010	24488189

J	Jung, Eun Young; Park, Choon-Sang; Hong, Tae Eun; Sohn, Sang Ho								Effects of Sc- and Zr-doped MgO layers on electron emission and discharge characteristics of alternating-current plasma display panels								JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS				53	3					036002	10.7567/JJAP.53.036002			MAR 2014	2014	To improve the material properties of a protective layer for alternating-current plasma display panels, a small amount of Sc or Zr was added to a conventional MgO protective layer. The electrical properties and surface characteristics of the Sc and Zr doped MgO protective layers deposited by an ion plating method were investigated. Experimental results show that the secondary electron emission coefficients of the Sc and Zr MgO protective layers are higher than those of conventional MgO protective layers, resulting in the reductions in firing voltage and address discharge delay time. To elucidate the reason for the increase in secondary electron emission, the changes in work function and energy band structure were investigated by cathodoluminescence (CL) measurement and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). The measurements show that the work functions of the Sc and Zr MgO protective layers markedly decreased in comparison with that of the conventional MgO protective layer. Experimental results reveal that the secondary electron emission has a strong correlation with the change in work function or energy band structure that is related to the defect level produced by doping, thereby resulting in changes in electrical discharge voltage and delay time.

High time and height resolution neutral wind profile measurements across themesosphere/lower thermosphere region using the Arecibo incoherent scatter radar								JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS				119	3			2345	2358		10.1002/2013JA019621			MAR 2014	2014	A method for estimating the vector neutral wind profiles in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MALT) region of the upper atmosphere from Arecibo dual-beam incoherent scatter radar data is presented. The method yields continuous estimates of both the altitude-averaged F region plasma drifts and all three components of the altitude-resolved neutral wind profiles in the MALT using data taken while the Arecibo feed system swings in azimuth. The problem is mixed determined, and its solution is not inherently unique. Second-order Tikhonov regularization is used to find solutions consistent with the available data while being minimally structured, additional structure being unsupported by the data. The solution is found using the method of conjugate gradient least squares and sparse matrix mathematics. Example data acquired during an interval of midlatitude spread F are used to illustrate the method. The estimated wind profiles exhibit characteristics broadly consistent with gravity waves but are impulsive, with features that generally persist for less than one and a half wave periods.									8	0	0	0	0	8			2169-9380	2169-9402		WOS:000336218300074

This work presents the first experimental investigation of particle electrophoresis in viscoelastic polyethylene oxide (PEO) solutions through a microchannel constriction under pure DC electric fields. An oscillatory particle motion is observed in the constriction region, which is distinctly different from the particle behavior in a polymer-free Newtonian fluid. This stream-wise particle oscillation continues until a sufficient number of particles form a chain to pass through the constriction completely. It is speculated that such an unexpected particle oscillating phenomenon is a consequence of the competition between electrokinetic force and viscoelastic force induced in the constriction. The electric field magnitude, particle size, and PEO concentration are all found to positively affect this viscoelasticity-related particle oscillation due to their respective influences on the two forces.

Synthesis, structure, and properties of anhydrous organic-inorganic proton-exchange membranes based on sulfonated derivatives of octahedral oligosilsesquioxanes and alpha,omega-di(triethoxysilyl) oligo(oxyethylene urethane urea)								POLYMER SCIENCE SERIES B				56	2			216	228		10.1134/S1560090414020158			MAR 2014	2014	A method of obtaining new organic-inorganic nanostructured proton-exchange membranes operating via the anhydrous proton-conduction mechanism is proposed. An oligo(ethylene oxide) component serves as a proton-conducting phase in these membranes, and the sulfo derivatives of octahedral oligosilsesquioxanes of the acidic and acid-base types are used as proton-donor dopants. These compounds are synthesized via the reaction of octaaminopropyl oligosilsesquioxane with the cyclic anhydride of 2-sulfobenzoic acid at various ratios and contain sulfo groups solely or sulfo and amine groups in the organic frame. The combination of these compounds taken at concentrations of 20 and 50 wt % with alpha,omega-di(triethoxysilyl) oligo(oxyethylene urethane urea) and phenyltriethoxysilane via the sol-gel method gives rise to hybrid organic-inorganic proton-exchange membranes. The synthesized dopants are distributed in the oligoether component, but the nature of dopant distribution depends on their structure and concentration and has a significant impact on the structure of the resulting amorphous membranes (according to DSC, SAXS, and AFM data). The synthesized membranes are thermally stable up to 219A degrees C. Their conductivity is provided by the segmental mobility of oligooxyethylene fragments (the Grotthuss mechanism) and, regardless of the dopant structure, is primarily determined by the number of charge carriers and the membrane structure. The temperature dependence of the conductivity is described by the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann equation. The maximum values of the ionic conductivity are attained at 120A degrees C under anhydrous conditions and dopant concentration of 50%: 1.03 x 10(-4) for ampholytic oligosilsesquioxane and 7.43 x10(-5) S/cm for fully sulfonated oligosilsesquioxane as a dopant.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1560-0904	1555-6123		WOS:000335504500015

The photon source is based on the fourth harmonic generation of a near IR beam from a Ti: sapphire laser pumped by a CWgreen laser and tunable between 5.3 eV and 7 eV. The most important part of the set-up is a compact, vacuum enclosed fourth harmonic generator based on potassium beryllium fluoroborate crystals, grown hydrothermally in the US. This source can deliver a photon flux of over 1014 photon/s. We demonstrate that this energy range is sufficient to measure the kz dispersion in an iron arsenic high temperature superconductor, which was previously only possible at synchrotron facilities.

The tea extract showed high antioxidant activity both in the DPPH and hydroxyl radical scavenging activities. At concentrations of 1.25 and 2.5 mg/plate, the tea extract exhibited an anti-mutagenicity induced by MNNG (N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine) against the Salmonella typhimurium TA100 strain. High concentration (200 mu g/mL) of the tea extract significantly induced apoptosis in human tongue carcinoma TCA8113 cells by upregulating Bax, caspase-3, and caspase-9, and down-regulating Bcl-2. The expression of genes associated with inflammation, e.g., NF-kappa B, iNOS, and COX-2, was significantly downregulated by the tea extract, demonstrating its anti-inflammatory properties. In addition, the tea showed strong anti-angiogenic effect at high concentrations. Moreover, LC-MS/MS analysis showed that gallic acid, beta-resorcylic acid, quercetin and kaempferol and their derivatives may contribute to the above mentioned effects. Especially beta-resorcylic acid showed strong anticancer effect in vitro. Beta-resorcylic acid was tested by MTT and RT-PCR assays. 100 mu g/mL beta-resorcylic acid showed the effect as 200 mu g/mL Bowl tea did, which indicated that it is an important compound in Bowl tea.

J	Yu, Lei; Li, Jianzhong; Cheng, Siyao; Xiong, Shuguang; Shen, Haiying								Secure Continuous Aggregation in Wireless Sensor Networks								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS				25	3			762	774		10.1109/TPDS.2013.63			MAR 2014	2014	Continuous aggregation is usually required in many sensor applications to obtain the temporal variation information of aggregates. However, in a hostile environment, the adversary could fabricate false temporal variation patterns of the aggregates by manipulating a series of aggregation results through compromised nodes. Existing secure aggregation schemes conduct one individual verification for each aggregation result, which could incur great accumulative communication cost and negative impact on transmission scheduling for continuous aggregation. In this paper, we identify distinct design issues for protecting continuous in-network aggregation and propose a novel scheme to detect false temporal variation patterns. Compared with the existing schemes, our scheme greatly reduces the verification cost by checking only a small part of aggregation results to verify the correctness of the temporal variation patterns in a time window. A sampling-based approach is used to check the aggregation results, which enables our scheme independent of any particular in-network aggregation protocols as opposed to existing schemes. We also propose a series of security mechanisms to protect the sampling process. Both theoretical analysis and simulations show the effectiveness and efficiency of our scheme.									1	1	0	0	0	2			1045-9219	1558-2183		WOS:000334672200023

The purpose of this paper is to identify research-based recommendations for implementing an international service-learning program. A review of literature was conducted in the Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature database using the keywords international, immersion, cultural competence, nursing, and international service-learning. Additional references were located from the reference lists of related articles. Planning of international or immersion experiences requires consideration of the type of country, the length of time, and design of the program; the use of a service-learning framework; opportunities that require the student to live and work in the community, provide hands-on care, participate in unstructured activities, and make home visits; and a method of reflection. Increasing cultural competence does not require foreign travel, but it does necessitate that students are challenged to move outside their comfort zone and work directly with diverse populations. These research-based recommendations may be used either internationally or locally to promote the most effective service-learning opportunities for nursing students. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

J	Gowtham, Yogender Kumar; Miller, Kristen P.; Hodge, David B.; Henson, J. Michael; Harcum, Sarah W.								Novel two-stage fermentation process for bioethanol production using Saccharomyces pastorianus								BIOTECHNOLOGY PROGRESS				30	2			300	310		10.1002/btpr.1850			MAR 2014	2014	Bioethanol produced from lignocellulosic materials has the potential to be economically feasible, if both glucose and xylose released from cellulose and hemicellulose can be efficiently converted to ethanol. Saccharomyces spp. can efficiently convert glucose to ethanol; however, xylose conversion to ethanol is a major hurdle due to lack of xylose-metabolizing pathways. In this study, a novel two-stage fermentation process was investigated to improve bioethanol productivity. In this process, xylose is converted into biomass via non-Saccharomyces microorganism and coupled to a glucose-utilizing Saccharomyces fermentation. Escherichia coli was determined to efficiently convert xylose to biomass, which was then killed to produce E. coli extract. Since earlier studies with Saccharomyces pastorianus demonstrated that xylose isomerase increased ethanol productivities on pure sugars, the addition of both E. coli extract and xylose isomerase to S. pastorianus fermentations on pure sugars and corn stover hydrolysates were investigated. It was determined that the xylose isomerase addition increased ethanol productivities on pure sugars but was not as effective alone on the corn stover hydrolysates. It was observed that the E. coli extract addition increased ethanol productivities on both corn stover hydrolysates and pure sugars. The ethanol productivities observed on the corn stover hydrolysates with the E. coli extract addition was the same as observed on pure sugars with both E. coli extract and xylose isomerase additions. These results indicate that the two-stage fermentation process has the capability to be a competitive alternative to recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae-based fermentations.

J	Daley, Shawna L.; Hassell, Richard L.								Fatty Alcohol Application to Control Meristematic Regrowth in Bottle Gourd and Interspecific Hybrid Squash Rootstocks Used for Grafting Watermelon								HORTSCIENCE				49	3			260	264					MAR 2014	2014	Application of fatty alcohol compounds to rootstock meristems can control rootstock meristematic regrowth, thus decreasing the cost of producing grafted watermelon transplants by reducing the labor. Eight rates of Fair 85 (R) and Off-Shoot T (R), two commercially available fatty alcohol compounds, were applied to the meristem region of bottle gourd (Lagenaria sicereria cv. Emphasis) and interspecific hybrid squash (Cucurbita maxima x Cucurbita moschata cv. Carnivor) rootstocks to determine the optimal application rate to control regrowth without damaging the remaining plant parts. A water-only control treatment was also included. Rootstock seedlings were rated for damage and regrowth on Days 1, 7, 14, and 21 after treatment. Damage increased and regrowth decreased with increasing rates of fatty alcohol compound. In addition, a significant compound-by-rate interaction indicated that inert ingredients in the fatty alcohol formulation have an effect on both damage and regrowth. The optimal treatment rate, e.g., providing at least 95% control of regrowth with less than 10% damage, was found to be between a 5% (Off-Shoot T (R)) In and 6.25% (Fair 85 (R)) fatty alcohol application. At the optimal treatment rate, no adverse effects to grafting success were observed in the grafting procedure.									4	0	0	4	0	4			0018-5345	2327-9834		WOS:000333223800005

J	Fleck, Robert K.								Can prohibitions on "price gouging" reduce deadweight losses?								INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF LAW AND ECONOMICS				37				100	107		10.1016/j.irle.2013.05.001			MAR 2014	2014	The vast literature on price controls says little about the way laws against "price gouging" differ from generic price ceilings, yet there is an important difference. By creating the foreseeable possibility (not certainty) of a shortage, a prohibition on price gouging may cause rational consumers to increase consumption. This has particularly interesting implications for markets with external benefits - expectations about policy-induced shortages may increase socially beneficial preparedness for times of acute scarcity (e.g., obtaining vaccinations prior to epidemics, keeping goods on hand in preparation for natural disasters). Thus, under some conditions, laws against price gouging may increase total surplus. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0144-8188	1873-6394		WOS:000334090600010		
J	Gong, Chao; Liu, Xiaohua; Jiang, Xiuping								Application of bacteriophages specific to hydrogen sulfide-producing bacteria in raw poultry by-products								POULTRY SCIENCE				93	3			702	710		10.3382/ps.2013-03520			MAR 2014	2014	Hydrogen sulfide-producing bacteria (SPB) can spoil raw animal materials and release harmful hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas. The objective of this study was to apply a SPB-specific bacteriophage cocktail to control H2S production by SPB in different raw poultry by-products in the laboratory (20, 30, and 37 degrees C) and greenhouse (average temperature 29 to 31 degrees C, humidity 34.8 to 59.8%, and light intensity 604.8 Wm(2)) by simulating transportation and a rendering facility. The amount of H2S production was determined using either test strips impregnated with lead acetate or a H2S monitor. In the laboratory, phage treatment applied to fresh chicken meat inoculated with SPB, spoiled chicken meat, chicken guts, and chicken feathers reduced H2S production by approximately 25 to 69% at temperatures from 20 to 37 degrees C. In the greenhouse, phage treatment achieved approximately a 30 to 85% reduction of H2S yield in chicken offal and feathers. Among all phage treatments, multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100 exhibited the highest inhibitory activities against SPB on H2S production. Several factors such as initial SPB level, temperature, and MOI affect lytic activities of bacteriophages. Our study demonstrated that the phage cocktail is effective to reduce the production of H2S by SPB significantly in raw animal materials. This biological control method can control SPB in raw poultry by-products at ambient temperatures, leading to a safer working environment and high quality product with less nutrient degradation for the rendering industry.									4	0	0	1	0	4			0032-5791	1525-3171		WOS:000334049700025	24604865

Some are observed to produce jets, whose appearance as a sequence of shock fronts (knots) suggests a past episodic outflow variability. This "jet fossil record" can be used to reconstruct the outflow history. We present the first optical to near-infrared (NIR) spectra of the jet from the Herbig Ae star HD 163296, obtained with VLT/X-shooter. We determine the physical conditions in the knots and also their kinematic "launch epochs". Knots are formed simultaneously on either side of the disk, with a regular interval of similar to 16 yr. The velocity dispersion versus jet velocity and the energy input are comparable between both lobes. However, the mass-loss rate, velocity, and shock conditions are asymmetric. We find. (M) over dot(jet)/(M) over dot(acc) similar to 0.01-0.1, which is consistent with magneto-centrifugal jet launching models. No evidence of any dust is found in the high-velocity jet, suggesting a launch region within the sublimation radius (<0.5 au). The jet inclination measured from proper motions and radial velocities confirms that it is perpendicular to the disk. A tentative relation is found between the structure of the jet and the photometric variability of the central source. Episodes of NIR brightening were previously detected and attributed to a dusty disk wind. We report for the first time significant optical fadings lasting from a few days up to a year, coinciding with the NIR brightenings. These are very likely caused by dust lifted high above the disk plane, and this supports the disk wind scenario. The disk wind is launched at a larger radius than the high-velocity atomic jet, although their outflow variability may have a common origin. No significant relation between outflow and accretion variability could be established. Our findings confirm that this source undergoes periodic ejection events, which may be coupled with dust ejections above the disk plane.									18	0	0	0	0	18			1432-0746			WOS:000333798000087

Classical novae (CNe) represent the major class of supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs) in the central region of our neighbouring galaxy M 31.Aims. We performed a dedicated monitoring of the M 31 central region, which aimed to detect SSS counterparts of CNe, with XMM-Newton and Chandra between Nov. and Mar. of the years 2009/10, 2010/11, and 2011/12.Methods. We systematically searched our data for X-ray counterparts of CNe and determined their X-ray light curves and also their spectral properties in the case of XMM-Newton data. Additionally, we determined luminosity upper limits for all previously known X-ray emitting novae, which are not detected anymore, and for all CNe in our field of view with recent optical outbursts.Results. In total, we detected 24 novae in X-rays. Seven of these sources were known from previous observations, including the M 31 nova with the longest SSS phase, M31N 1996-08b, which was found to fade below our X-ray detection limit 13.8 yr after outburst. Of the new discoveries, several novae exhibit significant variability in their short-term X-ray light curves with one object showing a suspected period of about 1.3 h. We studied the SSS state of the most recent outburst of a recurrent nova, which had previously shown the shortest time ever observed between two outbursts (similar to 5 yr). The total number of M 31 novae with X-ray counterpart was increased to 79, and we subjected this extended catalogue to detailed statistical studies. Four previously indicated correlations between optical and X-ray parameters could be confirmed and improved. Furthermore, we found indications that the multi-dimensional parameter space of nova properties might be dominated by a single physical parameter, and we provide interpretations and suggest implications. We studied various outliers from the established correlations and discuss evidence of a different X-ray behaviour of novae in the M 31 bulge and disk.Conclusions. Exploration of the multi-wavelength parameter space of optical and X-ray measurements is shown to be a powerful tool for examining properties of extragalactic nova populations. While there are hints that the different stellar populations of M 31 (bulge vs. disk) produce dissimilar nova outbursts, there is also growing evidence that the overall behaviour of an average nova might be understood in surprisingly simple terms.									16	0	0	0	0	16			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000333798000002		
J	Bisesi, Joseph H., Jr.; Bridges, William; Klaine, Stephen J.								Effects of the antidepressant venlafaxine on fish brain serotonin and predation behavior								AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY				148				130	138		10.1016/j.aquatox.2013.12.033			MAR 2014	2014	Antidepressants that enter receiving waters through final treated wastewater effluent have exhibited relatively low acute toxicity in traditional fish tests at currently measured concentrations. However, the psychotropic mode of action of these compounds warrants examination of the behavioral effects these chemicals may have on aquatic organisms. Previous research has demonstrated that exposure to the antidepressant fiuoxetine causes decreased brain serotonin levels in fish and results in a decreased ability to capture prey. Another antidepressant, venlafaxine, has been found at low mu g/L concentrations in final treated wastewater effluent. The objective of this study was to quantify the effects of venlafaxine on fish predation behavior and determine if this effect was correlated with changes in brain neurotransmitter concentrations. The predator prey bioassay used hybrid striped bass (Morone saxatilis x Morone chrysops) as the predator and fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) as prey. Bass were exposed to venlafaxine (0-500 mu g/L) for a period of 6 days and then allowed to recover for 6 days. During both exposure and recovery, bass were fed four minnows every third day. The time to capture the minnows was quantified and compared among treatments to determine if there was an effect on predation behavior. Brain tissue was analyzed for serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, to determine the relationship between exposure concentration, brain monoamine levels, and predation behavior. Results indicated that venlafaxine exposures increased time to capture prey 1 and 2 by day 6 for the 250 and 500 mu g/L treatments. Time to capture prey 3 was increased for all venlafaxine treatments by day 6. Venlafaxine caused a statistically significant decrease in brain serotonin concentrations that initially decreased in a dose dependent manner before reaching a steady state by the end of exposures for all treatments. No significant, dose-dependent changes in dopamine or norepinephrine were seen. Brain serotonin alone did not adequately explain behavioral results. Serotonin response in other tissues as well as peripheral effects may have accounted for additional behavioral responses after brain serotonin reached a depressed steady state. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The CUIntegration can integrate vehicle models of conventional vehicles as well as AFVs developed with MATLAB-Simulink, and a roadway network model developed with traffic microscopic simulation software VISSIM. The architecture of this simulator is discussed in this paper along with a case study in which the simulator was utilized for evaluating a routing strategy for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) and Electric Vehicles (EVs). The authors developed a route optimization algorithm to guide an AFV based on that AFV driver's choice, which included; finding a route with minimum (I) travel time, (2) energy consumption or (3) a combination of both. The Application Programming Interface (API) was developed using Visual Basic to simulate the vehicle models/algorithms developed in MATLAB and direct vehicles in a roadway network model developed in VISSIM accordingly. The case study included a section of Interstate 83 in Baltimore, Maryland, which was modeled, calibrated and validated. The authors considered a worst-case scenario with an incident on the main route blocking all lanes for 30 min. The PHEVs and EVs were represented by integrating the MATLAB-Simulink vehicle models with the traffic simulator. The CUIntegration successfully combined vehicle models with a roadway traffic network model to support a routing strategy for PHEVs and EVs. Simulation experiments with CUIntegration revealed that routing of PHEVs resulted in cost savings of about 29% when optimized for the energy consumption, and for the same optimization objective, routing of EVs resulted in about 64% savings.

J	Li, Ze; Shen, Haiying								A QoS-Oriented Distributed Routing Protocol for Hybrid Wireless Networks								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MOBILE COMPUTING				13	3			693	708		10.1109/TMC.2012.258			MAR 2014	2014	As wireless communication gains popularity, significant research has been devoted to supporting real-time transmission with stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for wireless applications. At the same time, a wireless hybrid network that integrates a mobile wireless ad hoc network (MANET) and a wireless infrastructure network has been proven to be a better alternative for the next generation wireless networks. By directly adopting resource reservation-based QoS routing for MANETs, hybrids networks inherit invalid reservation and race condition problems in MANETs. How to guarantee the QoS in hybrid networks remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a QoS-Oriented Distributed routing protocol (QOD) to enhance the QoS support capability of hybrid networks. Taking advantage of fewer transmission hops and anycast transmission features of the hybrid networks, QOD transforms the packet routing problem to a resource scheduling problem. QOD incorporates five algorithms: 1) a QoS-guaranteed neighbor selection algorithm to meet the transmission delay requirement, 2) a distributed packet scheduling algorithm to further reduce transmission delay, 3) a mobility-based segment resizing algorithm that adaptively adjusts segment size according to node mobility in order to reduce transmission time, 4) a traffic redundant elimination algorithm to increase the transmission throughput, and 5) a data redundancy elimination-based transmission algorithm to eliminate the redundant data to further improve the transmission QoS. Analytical and simulation results based on the random way-point model and the real human mobility model show that QOD can provide high QoS performance in terms of overhead, transmission delay, mobility-resilience, and scalability.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1536-1233	1558-0660		WOS:000333091600016

With the use of such devices, students are provided with invaluable insights into the skills perceived by the instructor as important, while concurrently, the instructor can gather feedback as to how well students have mastered those skills. In graphically intensive subjects such as chemistry, however, their use is severely limited by the input options afforded by current devices. It is often difficult to distill graphing and structure creation tasks into questions that can be answered with short strings of numbers or via multiple choice. We have developed the uRespond system-a touch-based personal response system that allows students to use iPads or more traditional computers to draw graphs and structures-to address this critical, formative assessment gap.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0021-9584	1938-1328		WOS:000333319500009

We exercised mares (n = 8) 6 days a week for 45 min from Day 16 until Day 80 of gestation. Color Doppler ultrasonography was used to evaluate embryonic vesicle size, fetal length, and uterine blood flow. Blood was sampled every other day to analyze cortisol and progesterone concentrations. Results indicated that exercising pregnant mares (n = 4) led to greater (P < .01) cortisol concentrations 30 min after the exercise period. No overall treatment effect could be detected in progesterone concentrations; however, following Day 60 of gestation, progesterone concentrations were lower (P < .05) in exercised mares. Additionally, progesterone concentrations peaked earlier in exercised mares at Day 52 of gestation compared to peak levels at Day 68 of gestation for control mares. No significant effects were detected in embryonic vesicle size. Fetal length tended (P = .06) to be longer in the conceptus of exercised mares. Uterine blood flow did not differ between groups but increased as pregnancy progressed (P < .001) in both groups. All mares in this study went on to deliver healthy foals and suffered no difficulties during parturition. These results indicated that moderate exercise was not detrimental to mare pregnancy.

However, current 3D MP-FRAP models are based on isotropic diffusion and spatial domain analysis. The 3D anisotropic diffusion and frequency domain analysis for MP-FRAP measurements are rarely studied. In this study, a new technique is demonstrated for the quantitative and non-destructive determination of 3D anisotropic solute diffusion tensors within biological fibrosis tissues by multiphoton photobleaching and spatial Fourier analysis (SFA). Compared to the spatial domain analysis based MP-FRAP techniques, this SFA-based method has the capability for determining the 3D anisotropic diffusion tensors as well as the flexibility for satisfying initial and boundary conditions. First, a close-form solution of the 3D anisotropic diffusion equation is derived by solely using SFA. Next, this new method is validated by computer-simulated MP-FRAP experiments with pre-defined 3D anisotropic diffusion tensors as well as experimental diffusion measurements of FITC-Dextran (FD) molecules in aqueous glycerol solutions. Finally, this MP-FRAP technique is applied to the measurement of 3D anisotropic diffusion tensors of FD molecules within porcine tendon tissues. This study provides a new tool for complete determination of 3D anisotropic solute diffusion tensor in biological tissues.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0090-6964	1573-9686		WOS:000333010700008	24248560

Colloidal force spectroscopy was applied to measure the maximum adhesion force and total adhesion energy between aggrecan end-attached spherical tips (end radius R approximate to 2.5 mu m) and trypsin-treated cartilage disks with undamaged collagen networks. Studies were carried out in various aqueous solutions to reveal the physical factors that govern aggrecan-collagen adhesion. Increasing both ionic strength and [Ca2+] significantly increased adhesion, highlighting the importance of electrostatic repulsion and Ca2+-mediated ion bridging effects. In addition, we probed how partial enzymatic degradation of the collagen network, which simulates osteoarthritic conditions, affects the aggrecan-collagen interactions. Interestingly, we found a significant increase in aggrecan-collagen adhesion even when there were no detectable changes at the macro- or microscales. It is hypothesized that the aggrecan-collagen adhesion, together with aggrecan-aggrecan self-adhesion, works synergistically to determine the local molecular deformability and energy dissipation of the cartilage matrix, in turn, affecting its macroscopic tissue properties.									3	0	0	1	0	3			1525-7797	1526-4602		WOS:000332756600009	24491174

A Genomewide Overexpression Screen Identifies Genes Involved in the Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase Pathway in the Human Protozoan Parasite Entamoeba histolytica								EUKARYOTIC CELL				13	3			401	411		10.1128/EC.00329-13			MAR 2014	2014	Entamoeba histolytica is a protozoan parasite that causes amoebic dysentery and liver abscess. E. histolytica relies on motility, phagocytosis, host cell adhesion, and proteolysis of extracellular matrix for virulence. In eukaryotic cells, these processes are mediated in part by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling. Thus, PI3K may be critical for virulence. We utilized a functional genomics approach to identify genes whose products may operate in the PI3K pathway in E. histolytica. We treated a population of trophozoites that were overexpressing genes from a cDNA library with a near-lethal dose of the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin. This screen was based on the rationale that survivors would be overexpressing gene products that directly or indirectly function in the PI3K pathway. We sequenced the overexpressed genes in survivors and identified a cDNA encoding a Rap GTPase, a protein previously shown to participate in the PI3K pathway. This supports the validity of our approach. Genes encoding a coactosin-like protein, EhCoactosin, and a serine-rich E. histolytica protein (SREHP) were also identified. Cells overexpressing EhCoactosin or SREHP were also less sensitive to a second PI3K inhibitor, LY294002. This corroborates the link between these proteins and PI3K. Finally, a mutant cell line with an increased level of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate, the product of PI3K activity, exhibited increased expression of SREHP and EhCoactosin. This further supports the functional connection between these proteins and PI3K in E. histolytica. To our knowledge, this is the first forward-genetics screen adapted to reveal genes participating in a signal transduction pathway in this pathogen.									6	0	0	5	0	6			1535-9778	1535-9786		WOS:000332648900007	24442890	
J	Carter, Michelle; Wright, Ryan; Thatcher, Jason Bennett; Klein, Richard								Understanding online customers' ties to merchants: the moderating influence of trust on the relationship between switching costs and e-loyalty								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS				23	2			185	204		10.1057/ejis.2012.55			MAR 2014	2014	Fostering customer loyalty is a key objective for online businesses. Initial transactions with new customers are less profitable than transactions with existing customers, making loyalty an important strategy. Drawing on research examining online customer loyalty (termed e-loyalty), switching costs, and trust, this study provides an empirical test of the relative influence of trust vs switching costs on e-loyalty for e-service providers. We further examine whether trust moderates the relationship between switching costs and e-loyalty. We propose that in the presence of high customer trust, e-service providers should have less need to rely on switching costs as a driver of e-loyalty. We test the hypothesized relationships using data collected from 299 repeat users of online travel services. Our results confirm that trust is a more important predictor of e-loyalty than switching costs. In addition, we find that the impact of switching costs on e-loyalty depends on the level of trust felt by customers. This study extends our understanding of customer loyalty, switching costs, and trust in e-commerce environments and provides practical, theory-driven guidelines to e-businesses seeking to develop customer loyalty programmes.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0960-085X	1476-9344		WOS:000332633200005

Prioritization strategies for patient evacuations								HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT SCIENCE				17	1			77	87		10.1007/s10729-013-9236-0			MAR 2014	2014	Evacuation from a health care facility is considered last resort, and in the event of a complete evacuation, a standard planning assumption is that all patients will be evacuated. A literature review of the suggested prioritization strategies for evacuation planning-as well as the transportation priorities used in actual facility evacuations-shows a lack of consensus about whether critical or non-critical care patients should be transferred first. In addition, it is implied that these policies are "greedy" in that one patient group is given priority, and patients from that group are chosen to be completely evacuated before any patients are evacuated from the other group. The purpose of this paper is to present a dynamic programming model for emergency patient evacuations and show that a greedy, "all-or-nothing" policy is not always optimal as well as discuss insights of the resulting optimal prioritization strategies for unit- or floor-level evacuations.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1386-9620	1572-9389		WOS:000332953800006	23666434

The experimental band gap for large single crystals has been determined to be 6 eV to 7 eV, from UPS and IPES, in line with expectations.

Although many companies may achieve this through lean implementation, high-variety manufacturers, for example, small and medium-sized make-to-order companies, have found that lean's planning and control techniques do not apply. This article outlines a planning and control concept known as workload control (WLC) that integrates customer enquiry management, including a due-date setting rule, with order release control. Simulation is then used to assess its impact on shop performance. Results demonstrate that an integrated WLC concept can reduce the percentage of tardy jobsso short lead times can be realistically quotedwhile also reducing and stabilizing workloads. WLC can level demand and production over time when work is not standardized and it is not possible to synchronize flows on the shop floor. Results are shown to be robust to changes in routing characteristics, the mix of orders with due dates specified by the customer and proposed internally, and the strike rate (or order-winning probability). Hence, an integrated approach to WLC represents an important step toward achieving lean in make-to-order companies.									16	0	0	0	0	16			1059-1478	1937-5956		WOS:000332771800012

However, the locally amplified electric field at the junction is likely to induce significant Joule heating effects that are not considered in previous studies. This work investigates experimentally and numerically these effects on particle transport and control in rDEP processes in PDMS/PDMS microchips. It is found that Joule heating effects can reduce rDEP focusing considerably and may even disable rDEP trapping. This is caused by the fluid temperature rise at the reservoir-microchannel junction, which significantly increases the local particle velocity due to fluid flow and particle electrophoresis while has a weak impact on the particle velocity due to rDEP. The numerical predictions of particle stream width and electric current, which are the respective indicators of rDEP manipulation and fluid temperature, are demonstrated to both match the experimental measurements with a good accuracy.									5	0	0	1	0	5			0173-0835	1522-2683		WOS:000332342200014	24165865

J	Scisco, Jenna L.; Muth, Eric R.; Hoover, Adam W.								Examining the Utility of a Bite-Count-Based Measure of Eating Activity in Free-Living Human Beings								JOURNAL OF THE ACADEMY OF NUTRITION AND DIETETICS				114	3			464	469		10.1016/j.jand.2013.09.017			MAR 2014	2014	The obesity epidemic has triggered a need for novel methods for measuring eating activity in free-living settings. Here, we introduce a bite-count method that has the potential to be used in long-term investigations of eating activity. The purpose of our observational study was to describe the relationship between bite count and energy intake and determine whether there are sex and body mass index group differences in kilocalories per bite in free-living human beings. From October 2011 to February 2012, 77 participants used a wrist-worn device for 2 weeks to measure bite count during 2,975 eating activities. An automated self-administered 24-hour recall was completed daily to provide kilocalorie estimates for each eating activity. Pearson's correlation indicated a moderate, positive correlation between bite count and kilocalories (r=0.44; P<0.001) across all 2,975 eating activities. The average per-individual correlation was 0.53. A 2 (sex)x3 (body mass index group: normal, overweight, obese) analysis of variance indicated that men consumed 6 kcal more per bite than women on average. However, there were no body mass index group differences in kilocalories per bite. This was the longest study of a body-worn sensor for monitoring eating activity of free-living human beings to date, which highlights the strong potential for this method to be used in future, long-term investigations.									5	0	0	1	0	5			2212-2672	2212-2680		WOS:000332501100016	24231364	
J	Haynes, Teresa W.; Hedetniemi, Stephen T.; Scott, Hamilton								Balanced Sets in Graphs								UTILITAS MATHEMATICA				93				343	356					MAR 2014	2014	Let S subset of V be an arbitrary subset of vertices of a graph G = (V, E). The differential 0(5) of S equals the difference between the number of vertices in V \ S that are adjacent to vertices in S and the number of vertices in S. A nonempty set S is called a balanced set if partial derivative(S) = 0. In this paper we introduce the study of balanced sets in graphs. Not all graphs have balanced sets, and such graphs are called unbalanced. We give proofs of the existence of balanced sets in various kinds of graphs, such as even order graphs, bipartite graphs, and graphs of maximum degree three. We also investigate unbalanced graphs.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0315-3681			WOS:000332188500030

Characterizing endogenous and exogenous peroxidase activity for bleaching of fluid whey and retentate								JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE				97	3			1225	1232		10.3168/jds.2013-7236			MAR 2014	2014	The lactoperoxidase (LP) system may be used to achieve the desired bleaching of fluid whey with the addition of low concentrations (<50 mg/kg) of hydrogen peroxide. The addition of an exogenous peroxidase (EP) to whey may also be used to aid in whey bleaching when the LP system is not fully active. The objectives of this study were to monitor LP activity in previously refrigerated or frozen milk, fluid whey, and whey retentate (10% solids) and to evaluate peroxidase activity in fluid whey and whey retentate (10% solids), with and without additional EP (2, 1, or 0.5 dairy bleaching units), over a range of pH (5.5-6.5) and temperatures (4-60 degrees C). Subsequent experiments were conducted to determine the relationship between enzyme activity and bleaching efficacy. Raw and pasteurized milk, fat-separated pasteurized whey, and whey retentate (10% solids) were evaluated for LP activity following storage at 4 or -20 degrees C, using an established colorimetric method. A response surface model was applied to evaluate both endogenous and EP activity at various temperatures and pH in freshly manufactured whey and retentate. Refrigerated or frozen storage at the parameters evaluated did not affect LP activity in milk, whey, or retentate. In fluid whey, with and without added EP, as pH decreased (to 5.5) and temperature increased (to 60 degrees C), peroxidase activity increased. Retentate with EP exhibited behavior similar to that of fluid whey: as pH decreased and temperature increased, activity increased. However, in retentate without EP, as pH increased and temperature increased, activity increased. Enzyme activity was negatively correlated to bleaching time (time for >80% norbixin destruction) in fluid whey but a linear relationship was not evident in retentate. When fluid whey is bleached enzymatically, if pH is decreased and temperature is increased, the rate of reaction increases (e.g., bleaching occurs in less time). When bleaching in retentate, a higher pH (pH 6.5 vs. pH 5.5) is desired for optimal bleaching by the LP system. Due to processing restraints, this may not be possible for all dairy producers to achieve and, thus, addition of EP could be beneficial to improve bleaching efficacy.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0022-0302	1525-3198		WOS:000331495200005	24440264

Evaluating the field performance of such material is critical for determining the success of breeding programs. In eastern North America, The American Chestnut Foundation has a backcross breeding program that uses Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollissima Blume) to introduce resistance of the fungal pathogen chestnut blight [Cryphonectria parasitica (Murr.) Barr.] to the native American chestnut [Castanea dentata (Marsh.) Borkh.]. We compared physiological and morphological characteristics among seedlings of American chestnut, Chinese chestnut, and BC1F3, BC2F3, and BC3F3 hybrid chestnuts during their fourth growing season after field-planting. American chestnut and the BC3F3 breeding generation displayed photosynthetic light-response curves that were similar to each other but different from Chinese chestnut. Rates of photosynthesis were higher for American chestnut and the BC3F3 breeding generation when compared to Chinese chestnut for light levels a parts per thousand yen800 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) photosynthetic photon flux density and for maximum photosynthetic capacity. Leaf morphology variables were not different between American chestnut and any of the breeding generations, but leaf area (on a per leaf basis) of Chinese chestnut was lower than that of any other chestnut type. Our results suggest that backcross breeding can be used to transfer desirable traits for restoration of native species threatened by non-native pathogens.									6	0	0	4	0	6			0169-4286	1573-5095		WOS:000331000500009

Dimensions of critical care nursing : DCCN				33	2			57	63		10.1097/DCC.0000000000000022			2014 Mar-Apr	2014	PURPOSE: Inadequate anticoagulation among elderly individuals with atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common problem. This synthesis of the literature review describes the pathophysiology of AF, explains the mechanism of action of warfarin (Coumadin), identifies factors that contribute to warfarin (Coumadin)-associated bleeding in the elderly population, and explores alternatives to warfarin (Coumadin) therapy. Implications for advanced practice nurse practice, education, and research will be discussed.METHODS: A literature search was conducted using Academic Search Premier, CINAHL Plus with Full Text, and Medline from 1999 to 2012. Search terms included warfarin (Coumadin), warfarin (Coumadin) genetics, diet, interactions, bleeding, atrial fibrillation, genetics, anticoagulation clinic, dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and elderly.RESULTS: The literature indicates that the potential bleeding risk associated with warfarin (Coumadin) therapy limits its use in the elderly population. However, some studies have found warfarin (Coumadin) to be more effective than aspirin in preventing stroke. The safety profiles of both medications were comparable; also, effective alternatives to warfarin (Coumadin) that do not require routine testing are now available.CONCLUSIONS: Atrial fibrillation increases the probability of an embolic stroke, especially for the elderly population. Stroke risk and bleeding risk tools, in conjunction with patient preference, determine the best stroke prevention treatment. Anticoagulant clinics manage long-term warfarin (Coumadin) therapy effectively. Newer anticoagulants offer effective alternatives to warfarin (Coumadin) therapy.									2	0	0	1	0	2				1538-8646		MEDLINE:24496251	24496251

Girls in grades 3--6 completed the Modified Attitudes toward Science Inventory. A purposeful sample of 30 girls participated in several focus-group interviews throughout the year. The cumulative findings indicate that our initiative ((1)) had positive impacts on girls who originally demonstrated low self-efficacy in science education or low attraction to science and ((2)) maintained the positive attitudes of the other girls. The instructional aspects of our initiative that contributed to the improvement in attitudes included the establishment of collaborative activities, a supportive lab teacher, and inquiry-based experiences focused on local problems. Our findings also reveal aspects of our efforts that we need to improve. These areas include a more open, inquiry-based science fair and connections between the lab and classroom teachers.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-5984	1554-8279		WOS:000332011400006

Because there have been limited studies to determine how snakes regulate prey populations, and because Kingsnake declines may result in ecosystem impacts, we evaluated the hypothesis that Kingsnakes regulate the abundance of one of their prey, the venomous Copperhead (Agkistrodon contortrix). We generated a database of captures of the two species across the southeastern United States and, while controlling for large-scale habitat preferences, identified a negative relationship between the relative abundance of Kingsnakes and the relative abundance of Copperheads. Our results are correlative but consistent with the hypothesis that Copperhead populations experience a release from predation pressure where Kingsnake abundances are low. We suggest that Kingsnake declines, which are occurring for unknown reasons, are having ecological effects in affected ecosystems. We further highlight the potential role that snakes play in influencing the population dynamics of their prey.									2	0	0	3	0	3			0018-0831	1938-5099		WOS:000332116200007

The delinquent group comprised 99,602 youth, born between 1981 and 1988, whose cases had been processed by the South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice. Records of 99,602 controls, matched by age, race, and gender were drawn from the records of the South Carolina Department of Education. Data on Child Protective Services, foster care, mental health referrals, and diagnoses as well as information about eligibility for free/reduced-price lunch were obtained from the South Carolina Budget and Control Board, Office of Research and Statistics. Logistic regression analyses showed that parental maltreatment and foster care made unique contributions to the prediction of membership in a delinquent sample. Presence of a public school classification of learning disability or emotional/behavioral disorder was also predictive of delinquent outcomes. A prearrest Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.) diagnosis relating to aggressive behavior (e.g., conduct disorder) was the strongest predictor of delinquency. Analyses conducted on the delinquent sample to predict recidivism showed a similar pattern, with an early mental health diagnosis of an aggressive disorder the strongest predictor of recidivism.									13	0	0	0	0	13			1063-4266	1538-4799		WOS:000331390800001

An SPE micropipette tip format was employed so that solvent, protein, and antibody consumption was minimized. The adsorption modification of the fiber surfaces with protein A was evaluated as a function of feed concentration and volume. Optimal modification of the fiber surface with protein A yielded a 5.7 mg/mL (bed volume) ligand capacity with the modified fibers showing stability across numerous solvent environments. Performance was evaluated through exposure to human IgG and myoglobin, individually and as a mixture. Myoglobin was used as a surrogate for host cell proteins common to growth media. The efficacy of the selective binding to the ligand is demonstrated by the 2.9:1 (IgG/protein A) binding stoichiometry. Elution with 0.1 M acetic acid yielded an 89% recovery of the captured IgG based on absorption measurements of the collected eluents. Regeneration was possible with 10 mM NaOH. Protein A modified polypropylene capillary-channeled polymer fibers show promising initial results as an affinity phase for efficient capture and purification of IgG.									15	0	0	9	0	15			1615-9306	1615-9314		WOS:000332183100006	24376153

Such excessive settlement can also present a challenge in the maintenance of subways during their operation. Thus, it is important to be able to accurately predict tunneling-induced settlement. The uncertainties in geotechnical parameters, however, can lead to either an overestimation or an underestimation of the tunneling-induced settlement. Such uncertainties can arise from many sources such as spatial variability, measurement error, and model error; in this paper, the focus is on the geotechnical parameters characterization from site exploration. The goal here is to determine an optimal level of site exploration effort so that effective predictions of the tunneling-induced settlement in clays can be achieved. To this end, a Monte Carlo simulation-based numerical model of site exploration is first established to generate artificial test data. Then, a series of parametric analyses are performed to investigate the relationship between the level of site exploration effort and the accuracy of the tunneling-induced ground settlement prediction. Through the assumed different levels of site exploration effort, statistics of soil parameters are estimated using the maximum likelihood method and the tunneling-induced ground settlement is then analyzed using the probabilistic method, and finally the effect of site exploration effort is assessed. The knowledge generated from this series of analyses is then used to develop the proposed framework for selecting an optimal site exploration program for improved prediction of the tunneling-induced ground settlement in clays. Examples are presented to illustrate the proposed framework and demonstrate its effectiveness and significance.

Here, uncertain geotechnical parameters required for analysis of tunnel performance (referred to herein as the structure safety and serviceability performance of tunnel cross section) are represented as fuzzy sets. Given fuzzy input parameters, the performance of a shield-driven tunnel will be uncertain, which is expressed in this study as a fuzzy factor of safety, according to the analysis of vertex method. Then, the fuzzy factor of safety for a given design is used to evaluate the failure probability and design robustness, which are, in turn, employed in the proposed RGD framework. Note that a design is considered robust if the performance of the shield-driven tunnel is insensitive to the variation of its uncertain geotechnical parameters. Within the RGD framework, each candidate design in the design space is analyzed for its safety state (in terms of failure probability), design robustness, and cost. The goal of the RGD of a shield-driven tunnel is to bring the safety state to an acceptable level, while maximizing the robustness and cost efficiency simultaneously. To this end, a multi-objective optimization is performed and a Pareto front is obtained, which provides a trade-off that may be used to select the most preferred design. Through an illustrative case, the effectiveness and significance of this new robust design methodology is demonstrated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

We determined the leaf N and P concentrations and N:P ratios for 31 Quercus acutissima provenances, and found there were significant differences in leaf N and P concentrations as well as in N:P ratios among these provenances. When grown under the same environmental conditions, the 31 provenances still retained significant patterns associated with their geographic origins. Leaf N and P concentrations declined toward the equator as mean annual temperature (MAT) increased, which can be explained by temperature-plant physiological stoichiometry. Leaf N concentration and leaf N:P ratios increased with increasing longitude due to the distribution of soil N content. Leaf P concentration initially decreased with increasing mean annual precipitation (MAP) up to 1500 mm y(-1), but then increased with further increase of MAP. Although there were significant differences in leaf N:P ratios among the 31 provenances, the relatively small coefficient variation (CV) in leaf N:P ratios and weak relationships between leaf N:P ratios and geographic origins, suggested a lower variation in leaf stoichiometry within the species when environmental influence was exclude in a common garden.

When a nonpassive mode is active, the increase in storage function is not necessarily bounded by the energy supplied to the switched system at every time step. Therefore, a switched system with at least one nonpassive mode is defined to be nonpassive in the classical passivity theory. In this paper, we propose a framework to analyze the passivity of such switched systems in a more general sense. We consider switched nonlinear systems which are affine in the control input and may consist of passive, feedback passive modes, and modes which cannot be rendered passive using feedback. In the proposed framework, we prove that a switched nonlinear system is locally feedback passive if and only if its zero dynamics are locally passive. A lower bound on the ratio of total activation time between (feedback) passive and nonfeedback passive modes is obtained to guarantee passive zero dynamics. Finally, we prove that two important properties of classical passivity still hold for the proposed passivity definition, that is: 1) output feedback control can be used to stabilize the switched system, and 2) parallel and negative feedback interconnections of two such passive systems are also passive.									13	0	0	0	0	13			0018-9286	1558-2523		WOS:000332037800010

Using data from privately collected, in-depth interviews, we assessed how distress in nonmarital romantic partnerships and best friendships influence anger. While social support researchers have examined the stress buffering influence of supportive relationships, we utilized the principle of negative potency to test the stress amplification effect of relationship distress through an assessment of stressful life events and racial discrimination. Our analysis showed that distress in relationships was associated with anger, while the presence of these relationships was not. Support for the stress amplification hypothesis was found as men and women who experience intense racial discrimination coupled with a more hostile best friend had elevated levels of anger.

Podila, Ramakrishna/0000-0003-0472-2361			Second- and Third-Order Elastic Constants of Filaments of HexTow((R)) IM7 Carbon Fiber								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				23	3			685	692		10.1007/s11665-013-0826-2			MAR 2014	2014	Single filaments of HexTow(A (R)) IM7-12K carbon fiber were subjected to tensile measurements on a device which applies a known stress sigma, and measures the resulting strain epsilon, and the change in resistivity Delta rho. Young's modulus E, the resistivity rho, the piezoresistivity Delta rho/rho epsilon, and the nonlinearity in the stress-strain relation delta, were determined to be 264.1 +/- A 16.0 GPa, 1.5 +/- A 0.1 x 10(-3) Omega cm, 1.3 +/- A 0.1, and -4.96 +/- A 0.23, respectively. The values obtained for Young's modulus and the resistivity of the fiber are in reasonable agreement with the values reported by the manufacturer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a measurement of a third-order elastic constant of a single filament of HexTow(A (R)) IM7-12K. Given the high elastic strains attainable in these fibers and the negative value of delta, the usual calculation of E from a linear fit to the stress-strain data leads to an incorrect higher value of E. According to the accepted thermodynamic definition of the elastic constants, one must use the initial slope of the stress-strain curve to evaluate E. We also observed that the glue used to secure the fiber has an influence on the apparent modulus of the fiber.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1059-9495	1544-1024		WOS:000331659700001		
J	Liu, Xiaoling; Murdoch, Lawrence C.; Falta, Ronald W.; Tan, Tianwu								Experimental characterization of CVOC removal from fractured clay during boiling								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER				70				764	778		10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2013.10.052			MAR 2014	2014	A series of experiments was conducted to evaluate the mass transport of a chlorinated volatile organic compound (CVOC) at boiling temperatures in low permeability clays where 20-100% of the pore water was removed. A kaolin clay matrix saturated with water containing 1,2-dichloroethane (DCA) and bromide (Br-) was packed into two columnar cells, a rigid-wall and a flexible-wall tube, which created different external boundary conditions. Both cells were heated to boiling temperatures and the recovered outflow was condensed and analyzed for DCA and bromide, and the clay remaining in the cell was cooled and analyzed for water and DCA content. Clay in the vertically oriented rigid-wall cell was heated to 130 degrees C with a power density of similar to 80 kW/m(3) and then depressurized at its upper end. DCA was nearly completely removed in approximately 15 min after 0.3 of pore volume water was recovered. The recovered condensate was enriched to more than 10 times the DCA concentration of the pore water. The flexible-wall cells were heated to 110 degrees C with a lower power density of similar to 44 kW/m(3). These tests resulted in slower recovery rates, and condensate concentrations that were approximately twice the pore concentration of DCA. The concentration of DCA in the clay was reduced by two orders of magnitude after approximately 0.5 of the pore volume was removed. Boiling was inferred to occur within the clay matrix because (a) DCA concentrations were enriched; (b) pressure and temperature conditions in the clay intersected the saturated vapor pressure curve; (c) Br- was absent from all but the initial outflow; (d) change in DCA and water content was roughly uniformly distributed over the length of the cell. Fractures appeared to have formed during heating, increasing the permeability, dropping the internal pressure and enabling stripping of DCA during boiling. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Innovation and Effectiveness of Co-Founded Ventures: A Process Model								JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND PSYCHOLOGY				29	1			145	159		10.1007/s10869-013-9306-9			MAR 2014	2014	We propose a process model relating innovative climates to effectiveness in co-founded ventures. Specifically, we argue that co-founders' inputs relate to venture effectiveness via processes of team member exchange (TMX), team learning, and collective efficacy.To study a population that is difficult to access, we use a computerized simulation in which 202 individuals act as new venture co-founders.Results of our research support the hypothesized input-process-outcome model such that the intra-team processes of TMX, team learning, and collective efficacy fully mediate the relationship between the input of co-founding team climate for innovation and the outcome of co-founded venture effectiveness.This study advances theory regarding processes that link team climates for innovation to collective outcomes. While we focus on this relationship in co-founded ventures, our findings have implications for team-level innovation research by clarifying how innovation relates to effectiveness. Beyond advancing theory, knowledge of this relationship may be of benefit to practice by identifying mediating mechanisms that can be reinforced in training and used as indicators of venture success by potential investors. Further, we contribute to the understanding of an important but understudied population of co-founded ventures and answer calls to utilize simulations to address team-based organizational questions.Our study answers calls to both clarify the processes that relate innovative climates to business outcomes and utilize computer simulations in organizational research while also addressing an important population of co-founded ventures that lacks a significant body of research.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0889-3268	1573-353X		WOS:000331382600011

DNA barcoding of tropical black flies (Diptera: Simuliidae) of Thailand								MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES				14	2			262	271		10.1111/1755-0998.12174			MAR 2014	2014	The ecological and medical importance of black flies drives the need for rapid and reliable identification of these minute, structurally uniform insects. We assessed the efficiency of DNA barcoding for species identification of tropical black flies. A total of 351 cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 sequences were obtained from 41 species in six subgenera of the genus Simulium in Thailand. Despite high intraspecific genetic divergence (mean=2.00%, maximum=9.27%), DNA barcodes provided 96% correct identification. Barcodes also differentiated cytoforms of selected species complexes, albeit with varying levels of success. Perfect differentiation was achieved for two cytoforms of Simulium feuerborni, and 91% correct identification was obtained for the Simulium angulistylum complex. Low success (33%), however, was obtained for the Simulium siamense complex. The differential efficiency of DNA barcodes to discriminate cytoforms was attributed to different levels of genetic structure and demographic histories of the taxa. DNA barcode trees were largely congruent with phylogenies based on previous molecular, chromosomal and morphological analyses, but revealed inconsistencies that will require further evaluation.									20	1	0	20	0	21			1755-098X	1755-0998		WOS:000331469500004	24112561

We used a combination of population genetic summary statistics (Tajima's D, Fu's F-S and (ST)), isolation-with-migration divergence models, and extended Bayesian skyline plots to reconstruct the recent biogeographical history of this species.ResultsThe largest values of phi(ST) across all loci were always between eastern and western samples. Population divergence models indicated no gene flow and mid-Pleistocene divergence times (>600ka) between eastern and western populations. Mitochondrial DNA diversity in the east was low, and coalescent-based estimates of effective population size were significantly smaller in the east 20,000years ago, at the end of the last glacial period.Main conclusionsThe results are consistent with a hypothesis in which north Pacific populations were separated into eastern and western refugia by 317ka with no gene flow since the split. Eastern populations probably underwent a severe bottleneck in population size during the last glacial period. The contrasting demographic histories of eastern and western populations are consistent with the general palaeobiogeographical pattern of greater climate-related extinction of marine taxa in the eastern Pacific.									6	0	0	7	1	7			0305-0270	1365-2699		WOS:000330907800017

As a result, assembly time estimation is rarely applied during early design iterations. In this paper, the authors explore the possibility of automating the assembly time estimation process while reducing the level of design detail required. In this approach, they train artificial neural networks (ANNs) to estimate the assembly times of vehicle sub-assemblies using either assembly connectivity or liaison graph properties, respectively, as input data. The effectiveness of estimation is evaluated based on the distribution of estimates provided by a population of ANNs trained on the same input data using varying initial conditions. Results indicate that this method can provide time estimates of an assembly process with +/- 15% error while relying exclusively on the geometric part information rather than process instructions.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1530-9827	1944-7078		WOS:000331145500005

The tool has been evaluated against different training set cases, suggesting that partially defined assembly models and training product variety are critical characteristics. Moreover, the tool is shown to be robust and insensitive to different modeling engineers.

This study examined factors that influence teacher candidates' intention to pursue a career in special education by surveying 214 preservice teachers. Data were analyzed using path analysis to capture the complex relationships. Results revealed that interest/commitment and outcome expectations of the special education careers were the two most important predictors of preservice teachers' intention to work in special education-related careers. Special education teaching efficacy only has an indirect effect on their special education career intention via two mediator variables (i.e., special education outcome expectations and career interest/commitment to children with special needs). Preservice teachers' personal and work experiences with individuals requiring special services directly influence their interest and commitment to serving individuals with special needs, and thus indirectly impact their intention to pursue a special education career.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0022-4871	1552-7816		WOS:000331200900006

Wildlife markets in South China								HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS				8	1			108	112					SPR 2014	2014	China is one of the largest consumers of wild animals for food and traditional Chinese medicine in the world. A large volume of illegal trade has been recorded in the primary cities, such as Hong Kong and Guangzhou, but the wildlife markets in secondary Chinese cities have not been investigated. This study was carried out in 7 cities in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. Wildlife trade data were collected using semi-structured interview, observation, and market survey. The study documented the selling of 97 animal species, >7,000 individuals. The most frequently used animal groups by quantity were reptiles (51%), followed by birds (21%) and mammals (10%). Of the reported species, 23% were threatened, including 1 species critically endangered and 12 species endangered. In this study, there were 19 species observed that are recognized by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). The results show that the animals originated not only from south China but also Indochina and Southeast Asia. Our survey also verified that Guangzhou and Hong Kong are not the only wildlife markets in South China. A large volume of illegal trade also is occurring in secondary cities in South China.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1934-4392	1936-8046		WOS:000339815800010

This is currently partially accomplished by mesh feed spacers, but mesh spacers increase the longitudinal pressure drop and form dead zones where foulants accumulate. Alternative spacer geometry is presented here where sinusoidal flow patterns are created. Several models of RD spacer channels with vai:ying amplitude and wavelength in their sinusoids were created for evaluation by three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations (COMSOL Multiphysics software) that included predictions of concentration polarization and flux. Results over a range of pressures and salt concentrations indicated that the more tortuous geometries (higher amplitude and shorter wavelength) induced greater local fluid velocity and decreased concentration polarization, which led to greater flux. Taylor-Goertler vortices generated in the peaks and valleys of the channels aided in mass transfer. The drawback to the sinusoidal geometry was an increased pressure drop, but one of the sinusoidal geometries tested had both a lower pressure drop and higher flux than a conventional mesh spacer. A subset of the spacer geometries was built and tested experimentally in a bench-scale RD unit. Experimental and modeling data were in good agreement confirming the benefits of the sinusoidal spacer geometries and suggesting that CFD is an effective tool for predicting performance.

To develop fouling mitigation strategies for microfiltration of biological streams, it is important to understand the mechanisms that lead to thuling. In this contribution, we discuss the use of confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) to determine where proteins and polysaccharides deposit inside polymeric microfiltration membranes when a fluid containing these materials is filtered. By using fluorescently labeled probes. CLSM permitted evaluation of the location and extent of fouling by individual components (protein: casein and polysaccharide: dextran) within wet, asymmetric polyethersulfone microfiltration membranes. By labeling the protein and polysaccharide with different fluorophores, we vvere able to locate each component separately and to visualize co -localization within the membrane. In addition, flux profiles and cross-sectional CLSM images were obtained for membranes that processed single -component solutions and mixtures to better understand the role of each on membrane fouling and to see how component interactions impact the fouling profiles. Analysis of the CLSM images at different levels of fouling for single-component solutions and mixtures provided concentration profiles versus depth for each individual component present in the feed solution. Using a new cross-sectional imaging protocol that we developed in a previous investigation, we were able to visualize fouling profiles throughout the entire thickness of the membrane, overcoming limitations of depth of penetration observed in previous CLSM work.

The device exhibits a red shift in response to the surrounding refractive index increases with high sensitivity, enabling a reflection-based refractive index sensor with a compact and simple configuration. By choosing the period of hole arrays, the sensor can be designed to operate in the near infrared telecommunication wavelength range, where the abundant sources and detectors are available for easy instrumentation. The new sensor probe is demonstrated for refractive index measurement using refractive index matching fluids. The sensitivity reaches 573 nm/RIU in the 1.333-1.430 refractive index range.

The merits and drawbacks of the Pinnacle 8151 dual potentiostat were investigated for use with a novel implantable biotransducer, the dual responsive microdisc electrode array (MDEA 5037) of ABTECH Scientific. The potentiostat was evaluated with R and RC dummy cells and with MDEA transducers modified with polypyrrolepoly( 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) electroconductive hydrogels that were all qualified by calibrated ac impedance spectroscopy. In a laboratory setting, the 8151 potentiostat maintained a steady and unbroken signal as far away as 75 ft (23 m), and when unobstructed, up to 100 ft (30 m). The error between the two channels was determined to be 6.4 (+/- 0.3)% and 0.7 (+/- 0.1)% for resistor-capacitor dummy cells (RC = nominally 10 M Omega and 1 mu F) and resistor dummy cells (R = nominally 10 M Omega), respectively.

J	Wang, Zhonghai; Qin, Wan; Shao, Yonghong; Ma, Siyu; Borg, Thomas K; Gao, Bruce Z								Pulse splitter-based nonlinear microscopy for live-cardiomyocyte imaging.								Proceedings of SPIE--the International Society for Optical Engineering				8948										2014-Feb-28	2014	Second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy is a new imaging technique used in sarcomeric-addition studies. However, during the early stage of cell culture in which sarcomeric additions occur, the neonatal cardiomyocytes that we have been working with are very sensitive to photodamage, the resulting high rate of cell death prevents systematic study of sarcomeric addition using a conventional SHG system. To address this challenge, we introduced use of the pulse-splitter system developed by Na Ji et al. in our two photon excitation fluorescence (TPEF) and SHG hybrid microscope. The system dramatically reduced photodamage to neonatal cardiomyocytes in early stages of culture, greatly increasing cell viability. Thus continuous imaging of live cardiomyocytes was achieved with a stronger laser and for a longer period than has been reported in the literature. The pulse splitter-based TPEF-SHG microscope constructed in this study was demonstrated to be an ideal imaging system for sarcomeric addition-related investigations of neonatal cardiomyocytes in early stages of culture.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0277-786X			MEDLINE:25767692	25767692	
J	Wiley, Jenny L.; Marusich, Julie A.; Huffman, John W.								Moving around the molecule: Relationship between chemical structure and in vivo activity of synthetic cannabinoids								LIFE SCIENCES				97	1	SI		55	63		10.1016/j.lfs.2013.09.011			FEB 27 2014	2014	Originally synthesized for research purposes, indole- and pyrrole-derived synthetic cannabinoids are the most common psychoactive compounds contained in abused products marketed as "spice" or "herbal incense." While 031 and CB2 receptor affinities are available for most of these research chemicals, in vivo pharmacological data are sparse. In mice, cannabinoids produce a characteristic profile of dose-dependent effects: antinociception, hypothermia, catalepsy and suppression of locomotion. In combination with receptor binding data, this tetrad battery has been useful in evaluation of the relationship between the structural features of synthetic cannabinoids and their in vivo cannabimimetic activity. Here, published tetrad studies are reviewed and additional in vivo data on synthetic cannabinoids are presented. Overall, the best predictor of likely cannabimimetic effects in the tetrad tests was good CBI receptor affinity. Further, retention of good C131 affinity and in vivo activity was observed across a wide array of structural manipulations of substituents of the prototypic aminoalkylindole molecule WIN55,212-2, including substitution of an alkyl for the morpholino group, replacement of an indole core with a pyrrole or phenylpyrrole, substitution of a phenylacetyl or tetramethylcyclopropyl group for JWH-018's naphthoyl, and halogenation of the naphthoyl group. This flexibility of cannabinoid ligand-receptor interactions has been a particular challenge for forensic scientists who have struggled to identify and regulate each new compound as it has appeared on the drug market. One of the most pressing future research needs is determination of the extent to which the phkmacology of these synthetic cannabinoids may differ from those of classical cannabinoids.

Supercapacitors have experienced commercial success with high surface area activated carbon electrodes; however, these systems are limited by the surface area and physical charge storage through the electrical double layer mechanism. Redox materials, such as metal oxides and conductive polymers, have attracted interest because of the increase in energy density obtained through faradaic charge storage processes. One of the main drawbacks of conducting polymers, which are far more abundant and cost-effective relative to oxides, is their relatively low theoretical charge capacity. In this work, we report the use of a high-charge capacity redox molecule, 1,4-benzoquinone, to increase the energy density of polypyrrole electrodes. The electrode synthesis conditions are shown to have a significant influence on the composition and electrochemical properties of the mixed redox material films. Polypyrrole electrodes doped with 1,4-benzoquinone exhibit specific capacitances as high as 550 F g(-1) and charge capacities of 104 mA h g(-1) compared to 236 F g(-1) and 50 mA h g(-1) for reference polypyrrole electrodes. Importantly, these results demonstrate that materials with diverse redox behaviors and potentials can be combined in an electrochemical system to develop organic electrodes with high specific charge capacities.									16	0	0	1	0	16			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000332059400015

Synthesis of trans bis-alkynyl complexes of Co(III) supported by a tetradentate macrocyclic amine: A spectroscopic, structural, and electrochemical analysis of pi-interactions and electronic communication in the C equivalent to C-M-C equivalent to C structural unit								INORGANICA CHIMICA ACTA				411				158	164		10.1016/j.ica.2013.11.036			FEB 24 2014	2014	Alkynyl complexes of the type trans-[Co(cyclam)(CCR)(2)] OTf have been prepared and characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, H-1 NMR, vibrational spectroscopy (infrared and Raman), and cyclic voltammetry. Where appropriate the data is compared to the corresponding Cr(III) and Rh(III) complexes. Though the arylalkynyl ligands have been shown to act as pi-donors for the corresponding Cr(III) complexes, vibrational spectroscopy suggests that the pi-interactions between the arylalkynyl ligands and Co(III) are quite weak, and that the more electron withdrawing trifluoropropynyl ligand likely behaves as a weak pi-acceptor toward Co(III). X-ray crystal structures for trans-[Co(cyclam)(CCCF3)(2)] OTf and trans-[ Cr(cyclam)(CCCF3)(2)] OTf are also reported and analysis of the M-C and C equivalent to C bond lengths are consistent with this understanding of the trifluoropropynyl ligand. Cyclic voltammetry of the trans-[ Co(cyclam)(CCR)(2)] OTf complexes demonstrates that when R = C6H5 or p-C6H4CH3, the Co-III/II reduction wave is chemically irreversible. However, when R = p-C6H4CF3, p-C6H4CN, or CF3, the Co-III/II reduction wave is chemically reversible. This suggests that the more electron withdrawing alkynyl ligands become pi-acceptors toward the reduced form of cobalt. Finally, the ferrocenyl capped trans-[M(cyclam)(CCFc)(2)]OTf complexes (where M = Co(III) and Rh(III)) were prepared and studied. Cyclic voltammetry shows only a single 2e wave for the ferrocenyl termini, indicating little to no electronic communication through the organometallic backbone. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Explosive nucleosynthesis of N-15 in a massive-star model								PHYSICAL REVIEW C				89	2					025807	10.1103/PhysRevC.89.025807			FEB 21 2014	2014	Background: Presolar meteoritic graphite grains from supernovas show spatially correlated excesses in N-15 and O-18. These excesses signal the helium-rich layers of supernova ejecta as important source material for the grains.Purpose: Elucidate the explosive nucleosynthesis of N-15 in massive stars, especially during shock passage through the helium-rich stellar layers.Method: A simple but realistic model of shock passage through the outer layers of exploding massive stars is used to follow the important N-15 nucleosynthesis production pathways and their sensitivity to explosion energy and governing reaction rates in a particular stellar model. All calculations are performed with open-source, freely available codes.Results: Recent reaction rate updates tend to decrease by similar to 4x the explosive helium-burning yield of N-15 relative to some commonly used stellar model outputs.Conclusions: Neutron-capture reactions on F-18 play an important role in the explosive production of N-15 in helium-rich stellar layers. This neutron-induced nucleosynthesis is likely connected to that of other isotopic signatures in presolar supernova grains. The Supplemental Material provides instructions that interested readers can follow for their own calculations of explosive nucleosynthesis and nuclear reaction rate sensitivities.									7	0	0	0	0	7			2469-9985	2469-9993		WOS:000332166000005

This paper presents variability of tidal harmonics of the latent heating from 2002 to 2011 associated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the tidal wind response in the mesosphere/lower thermosphere (MLT) region. Emphasis is on the strong ENSO cycle 2009-2011. Latent tidal heating rates are computed from TRMM satellite precipitation data, with added radiative heating from MERRA reanalysis, as functions of time, latitude, and altitude. The heating rates for the two most affected nonmigrating tides (DE3 and DE2) are examined and compared with MLT tidal wind variability from TIDI/TIMED. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to identify the tidal modes most affected by ENSO. Our results indicate that the tidal response to ENSO is largest during winter for both of the tides, with the largest response occurring in the DE3 tidal winds during the La Nina phase, with an increase of roughly 70% for the winter months of 2010/2011, and negligible response during the El Nino phase. The ENSO effect in the tidal forcing closely resembles the first symmetric and antisymmetric Hough modes of DE3 and DE2, thus being an efficient mechanism to transmit the ENSO signal into the MLT tides.Key PointsLarge DE3 and DE2 tidal response to La Nina El Nino has little to no effect on the tides ENSO-induced latent and radiative heating variability are both important									4	0	0	0	0	4			2169-897X	2169-8996		WOS:000332994600010

The synthesized polymers exhibit variable thermal properties depending on the functional spacer group (R). PFCH aryl ether copolymers with random and alternating architectures were also prepared from versatile bis-perfluorocyclohexenyl aryl ether monomers. The PFCH polymers show high thermal stabilities with a 5% decomposition temperature ranging from 359 to 444 degrees C in air and nitrogen atmosphere. These semifluorinated PFCH aromatic ether polymers contain intact enchained PFCH olefin moieties, making further reactions such as crosslinking and application specific functionalization possible.

More than 150 samples were melted in the ternary composition space, providing a detailed measure of the glass-forming region of the system. A Raman spectrum norinalization is proposed which permits semi-quantitative evaluation of the glass structure across the composition space of interest. This normalization is employed to compare the network structures evidenced in the chalcogen-rich and -poor regions, as well as the so-called "molecular" region. Application to the in-situ study of structural changes during heat treatment is also demonstrated. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this present study, the litchi pericarp and its aqueous-organic extracted residues were fermented by A. awamori in order to elucidate the enhanced beneficial effects. The study identified that rutin which present in litchi pericarp could be deglycosylated to form quercetin and quercetin-3-glucoside after the fermentation. Application the standard compounds (rutin, quercetin 3-glucoside, quercetin, kaempferol-3-glucoside and kaempferol) further revealed the effective biotransformation by A. awamori fermentation. It was hypothesised that rutin was initially dehydroxylated to form kaempferol-3-rutinoside and then deglycosylated to form kaempferol-3-glucoside and kaempferol. To our best knowledge, it is the first report on dehydroxylated effect of polyphenols caused by A. awamori fermentation. Thus, A. awamori fermentation can provide an effective way to produce health benefiting value-added products from litchi pericarp in food industry. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

E-a was then determined rising Kissinger-Akahira-Sunose and Friedman formulations. Observed E-a and predictor variables including conversion level and compositional parameters (e.g. proximate, neutral detergent fiber, lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose content and crystallinity index, were input to a stepwise regression to build an E-a prediction model. E-a calculated using T-alpha varied with conversion indicating more complex kinetics (multiple reactions) than a single kinetic triplet can describe although averages of observed and predicted E-a were statistically equivalent at 197 and 202 kJ mol(-1), respectively. Additionally, pine wood was evaluated to assess model robustness. With no significant difference between observed and predicted E-a (217 versus 211 kJ mol(-1), respectively), the model appeared robust. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AAA can be potentially stabilized by inhibiting inflammatory enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMP); however, active regression of AAA is not possible without new elastic fiber regeneration. Here we report the elastogenic benefit of direct delivery of polyphenols such as pentagalloyl glucose (PGG), epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and catechin, to smooth muscle cells obtained either from healthy or from aneurysmal rat aorta. Addition of 10 mu g/ml PGG and ECGC induce elastin synthesis, organization, and crosslinking while catechin does not. Our results indicate that polyphenols bind to monomeric tropoelastin and enhance coacervation, aid in crosslinking of elastin by increasing lysyl oxidase (LOX) synthesis, and by blocking MMP-2 activity. Thus, polyphenol treatments leads to increased mature elastin fibers synthesis without increasing the production of intracellular tropoelastin. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Near infrared fluorescence (NIRF) has emerged as a valuable tool for detecting and quantifying SWCNTs in environmental samples by exploiting their innate fluorescent properties. The objective of this study was to optimize NIRF-based imaging and quantitation methods for tracking and quantifying SWCNTs in an aquatic vertebrate model in conjunction with assessing toxicological end points. Fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) were exposed by single gavage to SWCNTs and their distribution was tracked using a custom NIRF imaging system for 7 days. No overt toxicity was observed in any of the SWCNT treated fish; however, histopathology observations from gastrointestinal (GI) tissue revealed edema within the submucosa and altered mucous cell morphology. NIRF images showed strong SWCNT-derived fluorescence signals in whole fish and excised intestinal tissues. Fluorescence was not detected in other tissues examined, indicating that no appreciable intestinal absorption occurred. SWCNTs were quantified in intestinal tissues using a NIRF spectroscopic method revealing values that were consistent with the pattern of fluorescence observed with NIRF imaging. Results of this work demonstrate the utility of NIRF imaging as a valuable tool for examining uptake and distribution of SWCNTs in aquatic vertebrates.									14	0	0	9	0	14			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000331015100074	24383993

Clinicoimmunopathologic findings in Atlantic bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus with positive Chlamydiaceae antibody titers								DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS				108	1			71	81		10.3354/dao02704			FEB 4 2014	2014	Sera from free-ranging Atlantic bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus inhabiting the Indian River Lagoon (IRL), Florida, and coastal waters of Charleston (CHS), South Carolina, USA, were tested for antibodies to Chlamydiaceae as part of a multidisciplinary study of individual and population health. A suite of clinicoimmunopathologic variables was evaluated in Chlamydiaceae-seropositive dolphins (n = 43) and seronegative healthy dolphins (n = 83). Fibrinogen, lactate dehydrogenase, amylase, and absolute numbers of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and basophils were significantly higher, and serum bicarbonate, total alpha globulin, and alpha-2 globulin were significantly lower in dolphins with positive Chlamydiaceae titers compared with seronegative healthy dolphins. Several differences in markers of innate and adaptive immunity were also found. Concanavalin A-induced T lymphocyte proliferation, lipopolysaccharide-induced B lymphocyte proliferation, and granulocytic phagocytosis were significantly lower, and absolute numbers of mature CD 21 B lymphocytes, natural killer cell activity and lysozyme concentration were significantly higher in dolphins with positive Chlamydiaceae antibody titers compared to seronegative healthy dolphins. Additionally, dolphins with positive Chlamydiaceae antibody titers had significant increases in ELISA antibody titers to Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae. These data suggest that Chlamydiaceae infection may produce subclinical clinicoimmunopathologic perturbations that impact health. Any potential subclinical health impacts are important for the IRL and CHS dolphin populations, as past studies have indicated that both dolphin populations are affected by other complex infectious and neoplastic diseases, often associated with immunologic perturbations and anthropogenic contaminants.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0177-5103	1616-1580		WOS:000330722700008	24492056

While the modeling strategy is typically selected according to expert judgment, the "best" modeling approach is unknown to the model developer. Thus, comparing plausible modeling strategies through a systematic and rigorous approach becomes necessary. This manuscript departs from the conventional approach that selects the model with the highest fidelity-to-data; and instead explores the trade-off between fidelity of model predictions to experiments and robustness of model predictions to model imprecision and inexactness. Exploring robustness in addition to fidelity lends credibility to the model, ensuring model predictions can be trusted even when lack-of-knowledge in the modeling assumptions and/or input parameters result in unforeseen. errors and uncertainties. This concept is demonstrated on the CX-100 wind turbine blade in an experimental configuration with large masses added to load the blade in bending during vibration testing. The finite element model of the blade is built with shell elements and validated against experimental evidence, while the large masses are modeled according to two different, but plausible strategies using (i) a combination of point-mass and spring elements, and (ii) solid elements. These two modeling strategies are evaluated considering both the fidelity of the natural frequency predictions against experiments, and the robustness of the predicted natural frequencies to uncertainties in the input parameters. By considering robustness during model selection, the authors determine the extent to which prediction accuracy deteriorates as the lack-of-knowledge increases. The findings suggest the model with solid elements offers a higher degree of fidelity-to-data and robustness to uncertainties, thus providing a superior modeling strategy than the model with point masses and stiffening springs.

Feeding performance of the Hawaiian sleeper, Eleotris sandwicensis (Gobioidei: Eleotridae): correlations between predatory functional modulation and selection pressures on prey								BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY				111	2			359	374		10.1111/bij.12214			FEB 2014	2014	The eleotrid fish Eleotris sandwicensis inhabits lower reaches of streams in the Hawaiian Archipelago, where it feeds on juveniles of native amphidromous gobiid fishes migrating upstream from the ocean. Using high-speed video and geometric modelling, we evaluated the feeding kinematics and performance of E.sandwicensis on free swimming prey, including two species with juveniles of different characteristic sizes, and compared successful and unsuccessful strikes. With fast jaw movements and a highly expansive buccal cavity, E.sandwicensis achieves high suction performance that enables the capture of elusive prey. Our analyses indicated that the species with larger juveniles (Sicyopterus stimpsoni) could be captured from a distance of up to 18.6% of the predator's body length (BL), but capture of the smaller species (Awaous guamensis) required a closer distance (12.2% BL). Predator-prey distance appears to be the predominant factor determining strike outcome during feeding on juvenile A.guamensis. However, during feeding on juvenile S.stimpsoni, E.sandwicensis shows modulations of strike behaviour that correlate with capture success. Moreover, the ability of E.sandwicensis to capture larger prey fish from longer distances suggests a potential biomechanical basis underlying observations that predation by eleotrids imposes significant selection against large body size in juvenile gobies.(c) 2013 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2014, 111, 359-374.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0024-4066	1095-8312		WOS:000329738700011

Material-Model-Based Determination of the Shock-Hugoniot Relations in Nanosegregated Polyurea								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				23	2			357	371		10.1007/s11665-013-0769-7			FEB 2014	2014	Previous experimental investigations reported in the open literature have indicated that applying polyurea external coatings and/or internal linings can substantially improve ballistic penetration resistance and blast survivability of buildings, vehicles, and laboratory/field test-plates, as well as the blast-mitigation capacity of combat helmets. The protective role of polyurea coatings/linings has been linked to polyurea microstructure, which consists of discrete hard-domains distributed randomly within a compliant/soft matrix. When this protective role is investigated computationally, the availability of reliable, high-fidelity constitutive models for polyurea is vitally important. In the present work, a comprehensive overview and a critical assessment of a polyurea material constitutive model, recently proposed by Shim and Mohr (Int J Plast 27:868-886, 2011), are carried out. The review revealed that this model can accurately account for the experimentally measured uniaxial-stress versus strain data obtained under monotonic and multistep compressive loading/unloading conditions, as well as under stress relaxation conditions. On the other hand, by combining analytical and finite-element procedures with the material model in order to define the basic shock-Hugoniot relations for this material, it was found that the computed shock-Hugoniot relations differ significantly from their experimental counterparts. Potential reasons for the disagreement between the computed and experimental shock-Hugoniot relations are identified.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1059-9495	1544-1024		WOS:000330594800001

However, the effective transport of NIPs into the contaminated subsurface zosnes is crucial for the success of in situ remediation. Previous studies have shown that the transport of NIPs in soils is very limited and surface modification of NIPs is required to achieve adequate transport. This paper investigates the transport of lactate-modified NIPs (LMNIPs) through four different sand porous media. A series of laboratory column experiments was conducted to quantify the transport of bare NIPs and LMNIPs at two slurry concentrations, 1and4g/L, under two flow velocities. The NIPs used in this study possessed magnetic properties; thus, a magnetic susceptibility sensor system was used to monitor the changes in magnetic susceptibility (MS) along the length of the column at different times during the experiments. At the end of testing, the distribution of total Fe in the sand column was measured. Results showed a linear correlation between the Fe concentration and MS, and that was used to assess the transport of NIPs and LMNIPs in the sand columns. Results showed that LMNIPs transported better than the bare NIPs, and a higher concentration of 4g/L LMNIPs exhibited uniform and greater transport compared with other test conditions. Transport of NIPs increased in the following order: coarse Ottawa sand>coarse field sand>medium field sand>fine Ottawa sand. Filtration theory and the advective-dispersion equation with reaction were applied and able to reasonably capture the transport behavior of NIPs and LMNIPs in the sand columns.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1090-0241	1943-5606		WOS:000332829300014		
J	Guha, Sujay; Natarajan, Ojas; Murbach, Cole G.; Dinh, Jessica; Wilson, Ethan C.; Cao, Min; Zou, Sige; Dong, Yuqing								Supplement Timing of Cranberry Extract Plays a Key Role in Promoting Caenorhabditis elegans Healthspan								NUTRIENTS				6	2			911	921		10.3390/nu6020911			FEB 2014	2014	Consumption of nutraceuticals is a major and potent dietary intervention for delaying aging. As the timing of administration is critical for the efficacy of bioactive compounds in medicine, the effectiveness of nutraceuticals may also be dramatically affected by the timing of supplementation. Cranberry exact (CBE), rich in polyphenols, is consumed as a nutraceutical, and possesses anti-aging properties. Here, we examined the influence of timing on the beneficial effects of CBE supplementation in C. elegans. The prolongevity effect of CBE in different aged worms, young adults, middle-age adults, and aged adults, was determined. Early-start intervention with CBE prolonged the remaining lifespan of worms of different ages more robustly than late-start intervention. The effectiveness of CBE on stress responses and physiological behaviors in different aged worms was also investigated. The early-start intervention prominently promoted motility and resistance to heat shocks and V. cholera infection, especially in aged worms. Together, these findings suggest that the timing of CBE supplementation critically influences its beneficial effects on C. elegans lifespan and healthspan. It is of interest to further investigate whether the similar results would occur in humans.									6	1	0	4	0	6			2072-6643			WOS:000335745900029	24566444	
J	Williams, Thomas M.; Amatya, Devendra M.; Hitchcock, Daniel R.; Edwards, Amy E.								Streamflow and Nutrients from a Karst Watershed with a Downstream Embayment: Chapel Branch Creek								JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING				19	2			428	438		10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0000794			FEB 1 2014	2014	Understanding sources of streamflow and nutrient concentrations are fundamental for the assessment of pollutant loadings that can lead to water quality impairments. The objective of this study was to evaluate the discharge of three main tributaries, draining different land uses with karst features, as well as their combined influences on total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) levels in reservoir-like embayment (R-E) on a stream entering Lake Marion, South Carolina. From 2007-2009, hydrology, TN, and TP data were collected from the 1,555-ha Chapel Branch Creek (CBC) watershed. In general, monthly streamflow in all tributaries was found to be -10% of rainfall, and as little as 0.1% in the smallest tributary. The third tributary flowed into a cave system and discharged via a cave spring (CS) into the embayment while gaining a sustained groundwater flow from a second cave (GW) system. The CS flow was substantially larger than the flow measured in the other tributaries. The small amount of rainfall that became surface flow and the large flow at the cave spring indicated a significant water loss from the surface watershed to subsurface flow or a groundwater source area substantially larger than the surface watershed. Nutrient concentrations in flows from tributaries draining various land uses were not significantly different (alpha=0.05) for most of the locations. A simple water balance was developed to estimate the R-E outflow to Lake Marion using measured discharges from three tributaries, change in storage computed using a bathymetric survey, daily lake level changes, rainfall, and computed evaporation. Mean monthly TN and TP concentrations in the embayment were substantially lower than the observed means from the two tributary outlets and the CS into the embayment, indicating a loss in the embayment. The second cave system at CS, representing an unknown subsurface drainage area, was the source of nearly 50% of TP loading, over 50% of flow, and over 70% of TN loading to CBC. These results may have implications in water quality management of the CBC watershed.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1084-0699	1943-5584		WOS:000335149700009

Brian				Smith, Phillip/I-5565-2014				Changes in the Incidence of Candidiasis in Neonatal Intensive Care Units								PEDIATRICS				133	2			236	242		10.1542/peds.2013-0671			FEB 2014	2014	OBJECTIVE: Neonatal invasive candidiasis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We describe the association between invasive candidiasis and changes in use of antifungal prophylaxis, empirical antifungal therapy, and broad-spectrum antibacterial antibiotics over time.METHODS: We examined data from 709 325 infants at 322 NICUs managed by the Pediatrix Medical Group from 1997 to 2010. We determined the cumulative incidence of invasive candidiasis and use of antifungal prophylaxis, broad-spectrum antibacterial antibiotics, and empirical antifungal therapy by year.RESULTS: We identified 2063 ( 0.3%) infants with 2101 episodes of invasive candidiasis. Over the study period, the annual incidence of invasive candidiasis decreased from 3.6 episodes per 1000 patients to 1.4 episodes per 1000 patients among all infants, from 24.2 to 11.6 episodes per 1000 patients among infants with a birth weight of 750999 g, and from 82.7 to 23.8 episodes per 1000 patients among infants with a birth weight,750 g. Fluconazole prophylaxis use increased among all infants with a birth weight,1000 g ( or,1500 g), with the largest effect on birth weights,750 g, increasing from 3.8 per 1000 patients in 1997 to 110.6 per 1000 patients in 2010. The use of broadspectrum antibacterial antibiotics decreased among all infants from 275.7 per 1000 patients in 1997 to 48.5 per 1000 patients in 2010. The use of empirical antifungal therapy increased over time from 4.0 per 1000 patients in 1997 to 11.5 per 1000 patients in 2010.CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of invasive candidiasis in the NICU decreased over the 14-year study period. Increased use of fluconazole prophylaxis and empirical antifungal therapy, along with decreased use of broad-spectrum antibacterial antibiotics, may have contributed to this observation.

In the first step the green vanilla pods were pre-frozen and then thawed to destroy cellular compartmentation. In the second step pectinase from Aspergillus niger was used to hydrolyze the pectin between the glucovanillin substrate and beta-glucosidase. Four main variables, including enzyme amount, reaction temperature, time and pH, which were of significance for the vanillin content were studied and a central composite design (CCD) based on the results of a single-factor tests was used. Response surface methodology based on CCD was employed to optimize the combination of enzyme amount, reaction temperature, time, and pH for maximum vanillin production. This resulted in the optimal condition in regards of the enzyme amount, reaction temperature, time, and pH at 84.2 mg, 49.5 degrees C, 7.1 h, and 4.2, respectively. Under the optimal condition, the experimental yield of vanillin was 4.63% +/- 0.11% (dwb), which was in good agreement with the value predicted by the model. Compared to the traditional curing process (1.98%) and viscozyme extract (2.36%), the optimized method for the vanillin production significantly increased the yield by 133.85% and 96%, respectively.									2	1	0	0	0	3			1420-3049			WOS:000334418200051	24556615	
J	Chen, Kang; Shen, Haiying; Zhang, Haibo								Leveraging Social Networks for P2P Content-Based File Sharing in Disconnected MANETs								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MOBILE COMPUTING				13	2			235	249		10.1109/TMC.2012.239			FEB 2014	2014	Current peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing methods in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) can be classified into three groups: flooding-based, advertisement-based, and social contact-based. The first two groups of methods can easily have high overhead and low scalability. They are mainly developed for connected MANETs, in which end-to-end connectivity among nodes is ensured. The third group of methods adapts to the opportunistic nature of disconnected MANETs but fails to consider the social interests (i.e., contents) of mobile nodes, which can be exploited to improve the file searching efficiency. In this paper, we propose a P2P content-based file sharing system, namely SPOON, for disconnected MANETs. The system uses an interest extraction algorithm to derive a node's interests from its files for content-based file searching. For efficient file searching, SPOON groups common-interest nodes that frequently meet with each other as communities. It takes advantage of node mobility by designating stable nodes, which have the most frequent contact with community members, as community coordinators for intracommunity searching, and highly mobile nodes that visit other communities frequently as community ambassadors for intercommunity searching. An interest-oriented file searching scheme is proposed for high file searching efficiency. Additional strategies for file prefetching, querying-completion, and loop-prevention, and node churn consideration are discussed to further enhance the file searching efficiency. We first tested our system on the GENI Orbit testbed with a real trace and then conducted event-driven experiment with two real traces and NS2 simulation with simulated disconnected and connected MANET scenarios. The test results show that our system significantly lowers transmission cost and improves file searching success rate compared to current methods.									28	1	0	0	0	29			1536-1233	1558-0660		WOS:000333091100001

Its successful implementation in disordered optical fibres recently resulted in the propagation of localized beams of radii comparable to that of conventional optical fibres. Here we demonstrate optical image transport using transverse Anderson localization of light. The image transport quality obtained in the polymer disordered optical fibre is comparable to or better than some of the best commercially available multicore image fibres with less pixelation and higher contrast. It is argued that considerable improvement in image transport quality can be obtained in a disordered fibre made from a glass matrix with near wavelength-size randomly distributed air-holes with an air-hole fill-fraction of 50%. Our results open the way to device-level implementation of the transverse Anderson localization of light with potential applications in biological and medical imaging.									23	0	0	2	0	23			2041-1723			WOS:000332669600017	24566557

Pedestal waveguides based on silicon are demonstrated as broadband mid-IR sensors. Our low-loss mid-IR directional couplers demonstrated in SiNx waveguides are useful in differential sensing applications. Photonic crystal cavities and microdisk resonators based on chalcogenide glasses for high sensitivity are also demonstrated as effective mid-IR sensors. Polymer-based functionalization layers, to enhance the sensitivity and selectivity of our sensor devices, are also presented. We discuss the design of mid-IR chalcogenide waveguides integrated with polycrystalline PbTe detectors on a monolithic silicon platform for optical sensing, wherein the use of a low-index spacer layer enables the evanescent coupling of mid-IR light from the waveguides to the detector. Finally, we show the successful fabrication processing of our first prototype mid-IR waveguide-integrated detectors.									28	0	0	3	0	28			1468-6996			WOS:000332466700016	27877641

OPEN SERVICE INNOVATION IN THE GLOBAL BANKING INDUSTRY: INSIDE-OUT VERSUS OUTSIDE-IN STRATEGIES								ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVES				28	1			76	91		10.5465/amp.2012.0126			FEB 2014	2014	The past several decades have witnessed the adoption and diffusion of open innovation processes across a variety of organizational and industry contexts. Despite significant scholarly investigation into open innovation's importance to firms' R&D strategies, a deep theoretical understanding of the open innovation framework remains elusive. This study contributes to this burgeoning literature by providing new theoretical and practical underpinnings of the open innovation framework. Specifically, we conduct a comparative case study of two global banks to articulate the theoretical underpinning of this approach in the micropractices and microfoundations of the two firms. Although all organizations practice some combination of internal and external sourcing of innovation, we find that there is a tendency for these practices to fall into two broad categories: inside-out open innovation and outside-in open innovation. Our comparative case study formalizes these two forms of open innovation as mechanisms to align global and local search in a service industry context. We found that the two banks' deployment of open innovation processes produced strong results including greater top-line growth and bottom-line efficiency gains, albeit by two distinctly different strategies, offsetting the many headwinds that crippled their peers during the past five years. We end this study by translating our results to possible avenues for future theoretical development and empirical investigation.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1558-9080			WOS:000332064600006

Prolonged presence of these nanomaterials within biological systems remains a concern due to potential adverse affects on cell viability and phenotype. Accelerating nanomaterial degradation within biological systems is expected to reduce the potential adverse effects in the tissue. Similar to biodegradable polymeric scaffolds, the ideal nanomaterial remains stable for sufficient time to accomplish its desired task, and then rapidly degrades once that task is completed. Here, surface modifications are reported to accelerate iron oxide MNP degradation mediated by polymer encapsulation, in which iodegradable coatings composed of FDA approved polymers with different degradation rates are used: poly(lactide) (PLA) or copolymer poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA). Results demonstrate that degradation of MNPs can be controlled by varying the content and composition of the polymeric nanoparticles used for MNP encapsulation (PolyMNPs). Incorporated into cellular spheroids, PolyMNPs maintain a high viability compared to non-coated MNPs, and are also useful in magnetically patterning cellular spheroids into fused tissues for tissue engineering applications. Accelerated degradation compared to non-coated MNPs makes PolyMNPs a viable alternative for removing nanomaterials from tissues after accomplishing their desired role.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000331953600011

Development of Luminescent pH Sensor Films for Monitoring Bacterial Growth Through Tissue								ADVANCED HEALTHCARE MATERIALS				3	2			197	204		10.1002/adhm.201300101			FEB 2014	2014	Although implanted medical devices (IMDs) offer many benefits, they are susceptible to bacterial colonization and infections. Such infections are difficult to treat because bacteria could form biofilms on the implant surface, which reduce antibiotics penetration and generate local dormant regions with low pH and low oxygen. In addition, these infections are hard to detect early because biofilms are often localized on the surface. Herein, an optical sensor film is developed to detect local acidosis on an implanted surface. The film contains both upconverting particles (UCPs) that serve as a light source and a pH indicator that alters the luminescence spectrum. When irradiated with 980 nm light, the UCPs produce deeply penetrating red light emission, while generating negligible autofluorescence in the tissue. The basic form of the pH indicator absorbs more of upconversion luminescence at 661 nm than at 671 nm and consequently the spectral ratio indicates pH. Implanting this pH sensor film beneath 6-7 mm of porcine tissue does not substantially affect the calibration curve because the peaks are closely spaced. Furthermore, growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis on the sensor surface causes a local pH decrease that can be detected non-invasively through the tissue.									6	0	0	5	0	6			2192-2640	2192-2659		WOS:000331949000005	23832869

T.								tau epsilon chi nu eta Photons: Evolution of a Course in Data Structures								COMPUTER GRAPHICS FORUM				33	1			294	304		10.1111/cgf.12279			FEB 2014	2014	This paper presents the evolution of a data structures and algorithms course based on a specific computer graphics problem, namely, photon mapping, as the teaching medium. The paper reports development of the course through several iterations and evaluations, dating back 5 years. The course originated as a problem-based graphics course requiring sophomore students to implement Hoppe etal.'s algorithm for surface reconstruction from unorganized points found in their SIGGRAPH '92 paper of the same title. Although the solution to this problem lends itself well to an exploration of data structures and code modularization, both of which are traditionally taught in early computer science courses, the algorithm's complexity was reflected in students' overwhelmingly negative evaluations. Subsequently, because implementation of the kd-tree was seen as the linchpin data structure, it was again featured in the problem of ray tracing trees consisting of more than 250000000 triangles. Eventually, because the tree rendering was thought too specific a problem, the photon mapper was chosen as the semester-long problem considered to be a suitable replacement. This paper details the resultant course description and outline, from its now three semesters of teaching.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0167-7055	1467-8659		WOS:000331694100024

We describe challenges and opportunities presented by the social web for Information Systems research and argue that an interdisciplinary approach may address the challenges of pursuing research questions about ephemeral social web phenomena. Through the creation of communities of practice that bring together faculty, IT professionals, and students from across academic colleges and high performance computing groups that lay a foundation for collaboration, information systems scholars may realize new opportunities for behavioral, design science, business intelligence, and IS strategy research. More importantly, through an interdisciplinary community of practice, we may inform how to develop an information systems curriculum that equips our students to participate in the growing knowledge economy.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0095-0033			WOS:000332484900002

This well-studied polymer is used as a model system to correlate intermicellar interactions with overall micellar stability. Decane is a preferential solvent for polyisoprene (PI) and drives the association of the polystyrene (PS) blocks, resulting in spherical micelles with a PS core and a Gaussian PI corona. The dissociation of the PS-PI micelles is triggered by increasing temperature, while the intermicellar interactions are controlled by varying the polymer concentration and modulating temperature. With increasing temperature, the cores of the micelles first swell, followed by a breakdown to smaller micelles, with similar shapes, that eventually dissociate into single molecules. Herein, it is shown for the first time that enhancing the intermicellar interaction delays the dissociation process of the micelles. <boxed-text content-type="graphic" position="anchor"> <graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="urn:x-wiley:10221352:media:macp201300597:macp201300597-abs-0001">image</graphic									3	0	0	1	0	3			1022-1352	1521-3935		WOS:000331963900004

This unique architecture is first employed for the preparation of model compounds with defined interaction between two small molecular organic chromophores. The interaction allows facile through-space energy transfer between the chromophores when they are held in the appropriate geometry. The oxacyclophane is thus employed in a polymer with consecutive short stretches of phenylene ethynylene such that polymer chain conjugation requires through-space interaction between segments rather than the through-bond -conjugation that typifies traditional conjugated polymers. The extent of the through-space interactions along the polymer backbone is explored through photophysical measurements, calculations, X-ray diffraction, and comparison with a variety of model and control materials. <boxed-text content-type="graphic" position="anchor"> <graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="urn:x-wiley:10221352:media:macp201300630:macp201300630-abs-0001">image</graphic									3	0	0	1	0	3			1022-1352	1521-3935		WOS:000331963900005

Orbital Solutions and Absolute Elements of the Short-Period Eclipsing Binary ES Librae								PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC				126	936			121	132		10.1086/675408			FEB 1 2014	2014	We have obtained new differential UBV photoelectric photometry and radial velocities of both components of the short-period eclipsing binary ES Lib. The system has a circular orbit with a period of 0.883040928 days and is seen at an inclination of 70.1 degrees degrees. With the Wilson-Devinney analysis program, we obtained a simultaneous solution of our photometric and spectroscopic observations that resulted in masses of M-1=2.30 +/-+/- 0.03M and M-2=0.97 +/-+/- 0.01M and the equal-volume radii of R-1=2.69 +/-+/- 0.02R and R-2=1.83 +/-+/- 0.01R for the primary and secondary, respectively. The secondary is oversized and overluminous for its mass. The effective temperatures of the primary and secondary are 8500K (fixed) and 5774 +/-+/- 57K, respectively. Despite the very large temperature difference, our photometric and spectroscopic data indicate that ES Lib is not semidetached but rather require it to be in an overcontact state, where both components exceed their critical Roche lobes. Given its nonthermal equilibrium state, if the overcontact solution correctly characterizes the system, the change from being semidetached to overcontact may have occurred recently. While the asymmetry of the light curves can be modeled well with a large, hot starspot or a large, cool one on the secondary component, we prefer the latter interpretation because cool spots are a typical feature on many contact binaries.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0004-6280	1538-3873		WOS:000332022000001

This may reflect interactive changes in central nervous system control of affect and autonomic function in the early stages of hypertension development.The purpose of this study is to determine the independence of cardiovascular emotional dampening from alexithymia to better understand the role of affect dysregulation in blood pressure elevations.Ninety-six normotensives were assessed for resting systolic and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, recognition of emotions in faces and sentences using the Perception of Affect Task (PAT), alexithymia, anxiety, and defensiveness.Resting DBP significantly predicted PAT emotion recognition accuracy in men after adjustment for age, self-reported affect, and alexithymia.Cardiovascular emotional dampening is independent of alexithymia and affect in men. Dampened emotion recognition could potentially influence interpersonal communication and psychosocial distress, thereby further contributing to BP dysregulation and increased cardiovascular risk.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0883-6612	1532-4796		WOS:000331646100012	23797904	
J	Azam, Hossain M.; Finneran, Kevin T.								Fe(III) reduction-mediated phosphate removal as vivianite (Fe-3(PO4)(2)center dot 8H(2)O) in septic system wastewater								CHEMOSPHERE				97				1	9		10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.09.032			FEB 2014	2014	Phosphate is a water contaminant from fertilizers, soaps, and detergents that enters municipal and onsite wastewater from households, businesses, and other commercial operations. Phosphate is a limiting nutrient for algae, and is one of the molecules that promotes eutrophication of water bodies. Phosphate is especially problematic in onsite wastewater because there are few removal mechanisms under normal operating conditions; a system must be amended specifically with compounds to bond to or adsorb phosphate in the septic tank or within the leach field. Vivianite (Fe-3(PO4)(2)center dot 8H(2)O) is a stable mineral formed from ferrous iron and phosphate, often as the result of Fe(III) reducing microbial activity. What was unknown was the concentration of phosphate that could be removed by this process, and whether it was relevant to mixed microbial systems like septic tank wastewater. Data presented here demonstrate that significant concentrations of phosphate (12-14 mM) were removed as vivianite in growing cultures of Geobacter metallireducens strain GS-15. Vivianite precipitates were identified on the cell surfaces and within multi cell clusters using TEM-EDX; the mineral phases were directly characterized using XRD. Phosphate was also removed in dilute and raw (undiluted) septic wastewater amended with different forms of Fe(III) including solid phase and soluble Fe(III). Vivianite precipitates were recovered and identified using XRD, along with siderite (ferrous carbonate), which was expected given that the systems were likely bicarbonate buffered. These data demonstrate that ferric iron amendments in septic wastewater increase phosphate removal as the mineral vivianite, and this may be a good strategy for phosphate attenuation in the septic tank portion of onsite wastewater systems.

Three crossbred steers (average BW 780 +/- 137 kg) fitted with ruminal and duodenal cannulae were used in a 3-diet, 6-period crossover design. Animals were housed in individual free stalls and fed twice daily at 0700 and 1900 h. Diets (DM basis) were 1) CONTROL, 19.5% corn bran, 20% sorghum silage, 60% brome hay, 0.5% trace minerals, and 0.25% urea, but no DDGS; 2) LOW DDGS, inclusion of 9.75% DDGS replacing equal percentage of corn bran; 3) HIGH DDGS, inclusion of 19.5% DDGS completely replacing corn bran. Feed ingredients and duodenal digesta samples were analyzed for fatty acid composition. The DNA was extracted from isolated mixed ruminal bacterial samples and from intestinal digesta samples. The V1-V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced, and bacterial phylogenetic analysis was conducted. Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS. Biohydrogenation of C18:1 increased (P < 0.01) with DDGS inclusion; means were 68.3, 75.6, and 79.3 +/- 4.3% for CONTROL, LOW DDGS, and HIGH DDGS, respectively. In the same order, means of biohydrogenation of C18:2 (P < 0.05) were 84.1, 91.5, and 93.3 +/- 3.4%. Duodenal flow of total fatty acids increased (P < 0.01) with DDGS inclusion; means were 134, 168, and 223 +/- 33 g/d for CONTROL, LOW DDGS, and HIGH DDGS, respectively. In the same order, means of C18:0 flow (P < 0.01) were 51, 86, and 121 +/- 18 g/d. DDGS did not affect the predominant bacterial phyla in the gut, which were Bacteroidetes (P = 0.62) and Firmicutes (P = 0.71). However, the phylum Fibrobacteres decreased (P < 0.01) when DDGS was fed with means of 5.5, 6.0 and 3.7 +/- 0.6% for CONTROL, LOW DDGS, and HIGH DDGS, respectively. Fibrobacteres were lower (P < 0.01) in isolated ruminal bacterial samples compared to duodenal digesta samples with means of 0.1 and 10.1 +/- 0.6%, respectively. Overall, the inclusion of DDGS in diets increased ruminal biohydrogenation of C18:1 and C18:2, which increased duodenal flow of C18:0. In addition, the bacterial community of the rumen clustered separately from that of the duodenum suggesting different bacterial diversity between isolated ruminal bacteria and duodenal digesta.									4	1	0	4	0	5			0021-8812	1525-3163		WOS:000331106400035	24664563

Friction therefore affects the processing time in the case of a load controlled process such as precision glass molding (PGM) and complicates the determination of viscosity when using parallel plate viscometry (PPV). In this combined experimental and computational study the ring compression test, where a "washer" shaped glass specimen is compressed between two flat molds at high temperature, is conducted and simulated. This test is very similar to PGM and PPV, making it ideal to quantify friction for these processes. The Coulomb friction model is used due to observed glass slipping behavior and the relatively low values of shear stress encountered in these processes. For glass at high temperature where viscosity is in the range of about 10(7)-10(11) Pa . s, it is demonstrated that the outcome of the test has a very weak dependence on material properties, which is significant since the stress and structural relaxation properties of glass within the transition temperature region are temperature dependent and difficult to obtain. The presented friction calibration curves are therefore material independent when the proposed processing procedure is followed. Sensitivity analysis is performed with respect to various factors, such as rate of deformation, magnitude of loading, temperature non-uniformity and contact of the inner and outer cylindrical surfaces with the mold surfaces, providing the experimentalist with guidelines to conduct valid tests. Using this friction characterization method, the viscosity range for PPV can be increased by accurately correcting for interface slip. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The cancellation circuit features a feed-forward voltage-detecting-voltage-compensating structure. Unlike other voltage-compensating circuitry employing CM transformers on the thick phase wires, the proposed circuit is compactly integrated on the inverter printed circuit board. A prototype low-voltage space-vector-pulse-width-modulation (SVPWM) inverter employing this active cancellation technique was built and tested. This cost-effective and light-weight circuit significantly reduced the CM noise at the fundamental switching frequency and harmonics up to 2 MHz.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0018-9375	1558-187X		WOS:000331300800009

While fluoroscopy, ultrasound, and electroanatomic maps are important guidance tools, they lack information regarding detailed patient anatomy which can be obtained from high resolution imaging techniques. For this reason, there has been significant effort in incorporating detailed, patient-specific models generated from preoperative imaging datasets into the procedure. Both clinical and animal studies have investigated registration and targeting accuracy when using preoperative models; however, the effect of various error sources on registration accuracy has not been quantitatively evaluated.Methods: Data from phantom, canine, and patient studies are used to model and evaluate registration accuracy. In the phantom studies, data are collected using a magnetically tracked catheter on a static phantom model. Monte Carlo simulation studies were run to evaluate both baseline errors as well as the effect of different sources of error that would be present in a dynamic in vivo setting. Error is simulated by varying the variance parameters on the landmark fiducial, physical target, and surface point locations in the phantom simulation studies. In vivo validation studies were undertaken in six canines in which metal clips were placed in the left atrium to serve as ground truth points. A small clinical evaluation was completed in three patients. Landmark-based and combined landmark and surface-based registration algorithms were evaluated in all studies. In the phantom and canine studies, both target registration error and point-to-surface error are used to assess accuracy. In the patient studies, no ground truth is available and registration accuracy is quantified using point-to-surface error only.Results: The phantom simulation studies demonstrated that combined landmark and surface-based registration improved landmark-only registration provided the noise in the surface points is not excessively high. Increased variability on the landmark fiducials resulted in increased registration errors; however, refinement of the initial landmark registration by the surface-based algorithm can compensate for small initial misalignments. The surface-based registration algorithm is quite robust to noise on the surface points and continues to improve landmark registration even at high levels of noise on the surface points. Both the canine and patient studies also demonstrate that combined landmark and surface registration has lower errors than landmark registration alone.Conclusions: In this work, we describe a model for evaluating the impact of noise variability on the input parameters of a registration algorithm in the context of cardiac ablation therapy. The model can be used to predict both registration error as well as assess which inputs have the largest effect on registration accuracy.

However, the direct and long-term interaction of iron oxide nanoparticles with cells and biological systems can induce adverse effects on cell viability, phenotype and function, and remain a critical concern. Here we report the preparation of biological magnetic cellular spheroids containing magnetoferritin, a biological MNP, capable of serving as a biological alternative to iron oxide magnetic cellular spheroids as tissue engineered building blocks. Magnetoferritin NPs were incorporated into 3-D cellular spheroids with no adverse effects on cell viability up to 1 week. Additionally, cellular spheroids containing magnetoferritin NPs were magnetically patterned and fused into a tissue ring to demonstrate its potential for tissue engineering applications. These results present a biological approach that can serve as an alternative to the commonly used iron oxide magnetic cellular spheroids, which often require complex surface modifications of iron oxide NPs to reduce the adverse effects on cells.

Characteristics of land categories inform potential land use change impacts as well as switchgrass profitability. Variable yields within and across land categories are translated into distributions of switchgrass net revenue. Breakeven curves are generated for a range of switchgrass prices. These curves provide upper bounds for further analysis of actual switchgrass adoption in context of broader economic forces and possible policy mechanisms to minimize environmental impacts. A farm-gate price of $55 Mg-1 is estimated for half of marginal and pasturelands to break even with switchgrass. At this price, only 20% of land in hay and a small fraction of row crop hectares break even. Half of hay and row crops hectares break even at approximately $90 Mg-1 and $100 Mg-1, respectively. At $60 Mg-1, sufficient land area can profitably produce switchgrass for ethanol to displace approximately 10% of gasoline consumed in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina; however, this price only indicates breakeven capacity implying that higher prices may be necessary to realize 10% displacement.

Effects of estrogen and opioid blockade on blood pressure reactivity to stress in postmenopausal women								JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE				37	1			94	101		10.1007/s10865-012-9468-3			FEB 2014	2014	Estrogen may influence coronary heart disease risk in women through the effects of endogenous opioids on autonomic control of blood pressure. In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we examined the combined effects of estrogen and the opioid antagonist, naltrexone, on blood pressure responses to psychological stress in 42 postmenopausal women. After 3 months of estrogen or estrogen plus progestin (hormone replacement therapy; n = 27) or placebo replacement, participants completed a mental arithmetic task after administration of .7 mg/kg oral naltrexone or placebo. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure and heart rate (HR) were measured at rest and during the arithmetic stressor. Stress produced significant increases in circulatory measures regardless of estrogen condition or opioid blockade (p's < .001). Interestingly, there was an estrogen by naltrexone interaction on SBP reactivity scores [F(1,38) = 4.36, p < .05], where women on estrogen with intact opioid receptors showed the largest SBP responses to stress, compared with all other conditions. This is consistent with some studies of premenopausal women, suggesting that estrogens may alter opioid function during stress. The interaction between estrogen and endogenous opioids may explain sex differences in opioid effects on stress reactivity in younger premenopausal women.									2	1	0	2	0	3			0160-7715	1573-3521		WOS:000330784900009	23135529

The proteins encoded by these genes contained one or two highly conserved DUF966 domains. The available data of public microarray databases implied that these genes might play crucial roles in plant response to abiotic stresses. In this study, a member of the DUF966 gene family, DUF966-stress repressive gene 2 in Oryza sativa (OsDSR2, Loc_Os01g62200), was cloned and its role in rice responding to salt and simulated drought stresses was functionally characterized. OsDSR2 was expressed mainly in nodes of stems and leaf blades from rice. Expression profile analysis of adversity showed that OsDSR2 had different transcriptional responses to salt, drought, cold, heat and oxidative (H2O2) stresses, as well as abscisic acid (ABA), methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid, gibberellin acid and auxin treatments. Transient expression demonstrated that OsDSR2 was localized in the membrane and nucleus. Overexpression of OsDSR2 could increase salt and simulated drought (polyethyleneglycol)-stress sensitivities in rice by downregulating the expression of ABA- and stress-responsive genes including OsNCED4, SNAC1, OsbZIP23, P5CS, Oslea3 and rab16C. Furthermore, OsDSR2-overexpressing plants showed reduced ABA sensitivity during the post-germination stage. These results suggested that OsDSR2 negatively regulated rice response to salt and simulated drought stresses as well as ABA signaling, which provided some useful data for understanding the functional roles of DUF966 family genes in abiotic stress responses in plants.									4	2	0	4	0	5			0721-7714	1432-203X		WOS:000330994700012	24247850

Lizard Microhabitat and Microclimate Relationships in Southeastern Pine-Hardwood Forests Managed With Prescribed Burning and Thinning								FOREST SCIENCE				60	1			180	190		10.5849/forsci.11-076			FEB 2014	2014	Understanding the impacts of disturbances in forest ecosystems is essential for long-term biodiversity conservation. Many studies have evaluated wildlife responses to various disturbances but most generally do not use changes in microclimate features or microhabitat structure to explain these responses. We examined lizard responses to two common forest management practices (prescribed burning and thinning) in pine-hardwood forests of the Bankhead National Forest, Alabama, USA. Over 4 years, we captured 719 individual lizards representing seven species. Lizards exhibited species-specific responses to forest management: eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulatus) captures were positively associated with an increasing forest disturbance gradient and were greatest in thin with burn treatments, whereas little brown skink (Scincella lateral's) captures were positively associated with increasing liner depth and were greatest in control sites during the first year posttreatment. Green anole (Anolis carolinensis) captures increased in forest stands with concomitant increases in air temperature, whereas common five-lined skink (Plestiodon fasciatus) captures were related to coarse woody debris cover during posttreatment sampling. We were unable to detect a treatment response or microhabitat/microclimate associations for broad-headed skinks (Plestiodon laticeps). Through an information-theoretic approach, we were able to identify treatment effects along with changes in microclimate and microhabitat features potentially responsible for driving responses of southeastern lizard species to forest management.									8	0	0	8	0	8			0015-749X	1938-3738		WOS:000330605500019

Survival and Growth of Suppressed Baldcypress Reproduction in Response to Canopy Gap Creation in a North Carolina, USA Swamp								WETLANDS				34	1			79	87		10.1007/s13157-013-0484-z			FEB 2014	2014	Little is known of the ability of baldcypress (Taxodium distichum (L.) L.C. Rich.) in a suppressed sub-canopy position to respond to increases in light. We measured 3 years of diameter growth response of long-suppressed baldcypress saplings to canopy gap creation in a hydrologically altered, water tupelo-dominated backswamp of the lower Roanoke River floodplain in eastern North Carolina. Baldcypress saplings responded strongly to gap creation. Saplings showed a significant positive growth trend, with mean basal area growth in gaps expanding from 2.5 cm(2) in year one, 4 times that of control saplings, to 8.5 cm(2) in year three, 20 times that of control saplings. Within canopy gaps, a positive trend between growth and initial sapling diameter was evident, while such a trend among controls was non-existent. Mortality was similar between gap and control saplings after 1 year, but by year three gap sapling mortality had declined to 2 %, while control mortality increased to 16 %. It is clear that long-suppressed baldcypress, sometimes at the brink of death, are able to respond vigorously to an increase in light from canopy gaps with decreased mortality and increased growth. This has important implications for wetlands requiring restoration or baldcypress management within the framework of two-age or uneven-aged silvicultural systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0277-5212	1943-6246		WOS:000330740600008

The paper starts by highlighting the needs for the vehicular structure forming process with respect to the main production line requirements through using Quality Function Deployment QFD matrix. Additionally, the potentials of fold forming for sheet metal parts in achieving the major production needs will then be benchmarked against other forming techniques through a decision making tool namely; the Analytical Hierarchy Process AHP. The study investigates the application of flat pattern tools for sheet metal products derived from analysis for thin or zero thickness sheets (i.e. paper origami). The analysis sets an approach to generate all possible configurations of flat patterns that result in a specific 3-D structure profile. Secondly, a set of optimality selection metrics are developed and applied to these configurations to help determine the most optimized flat pattern. These optimality measures are a metric based on compactness, a metric for nesting efficiency to describe the strip layout planning, and two measures to assess the manufacturing aspect i.e. bending operation in terms of number and orientation of bend lines.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0956-5515	1572-8145		WOS:000330590600009

A Gesture Learning Interface for Simulated Robot Path Shaping With a Human Teacher								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON HUMAN-MACHINE SYSTEMS				44	1			41	54		10.1109/TSMC.2013.2291714			FEB 2014	2014	Recognition of human gestures is an active area of research integral for the development of intuitive human-machine interfaces for ubiquitous computing and assistive robotics. In particular, such systems are key to effective environmental designs that facilitate aging in place. Typically, gesture recognition takes the form of template matching in which the human participant is expected to emulate a choreographed motion as prescribed by the researchers. A corresponding robotic action is then a one-toone mapping of the template classification to a library of distinct responses. In this paper, we explore a recognition scheme based on the growing neural gas (GNG) algorithm that places no initial constraints on the user to perform gestures in a specific way. Motion descriptors extracted from sequential skeletal depth data are clustered by GNG and mapped directly to a robotic response that is refined through reinforcement learning. A simple good/bad reward signal is provided by the user. This paper presents results that show that the topology-preserving quality of GNG allows generalization between gestured commands. Experimental results using an automated reward are presented that compare learning results involving single nodes versus results involving the influence of node neighborhoods. Although separability of input data influences the speed of learning convergence for a given neighborhood radius, it is shown that learning progresses toward emulation of an associative memory that maps input gesture to desired action.									11	1	0	0	0	12			2168-2291	2168-2305		WOS:000330168600004

Differential Susceptibility of Nine Cucurbit Species to the Foliar Blight and Crown Canker Phases of Gummy Stem Blight								PLANT DISEASE				98	2			247	254		10.1094/PDIS-05-13-0510-RE			FEB 2014	2014	Eighteen cucurbit cultivars representing five genera, nine species, and 17 horticultural types were inoculated with Didymella bryoniae in field plots in Charleston, SC, in autumn 2008, autumn 2009, and spring 2011 to determine susceptibility to gummy stem blight. In each year, gummy stem blight cankers occurred more frequently on crowns or main stems of 'Athena' muskmelon (Cucumis melo) and 'Green Striped Cushaw' squash (Cucurbita argyrosperma) than on all other cultivars except 'Rocio' honeydew (Cucumis melo) in 2009, and bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria) and Ojakkyo citron (Citrullus lanatus var. citroides) in 2011. Cucurbita moschata was highly resistant to stem cankers. Severity of gummy stem blight on foliage was moderate to severe in autumn 2009, mild to severe in autumn 2008, and very mild in spring 2011 (due to unusually dry weather). Watermelon (Citrullus lanatus var. lanatus) and melon were the most susceptible to foliar blight in 2008 and 2009. In all 3 years, 'Cheese' and 'Bugle' squash (both Cucurbita moschata), and 'Judgment III' and 'Lioness' summer squash (C. pepo) were among the cultivars with the least diseased leaf area. C. moschata, C. pepo, C. maxima, and Luffa cylindrica (smooth loofah) were significantly less susceptible to foliar blight than Cucumis melo and three Citrullus lanatus cultivars in 2008 and 2009. This study also is the first documentation of susceptibility of Cucurbita argyrosperma to gummy stem blight.									5	0	0	6	1	6			0191-2917	1943-7692		WOS:000330081200010		
J	Keinath, A. P.; Hassell, R. L.								Control of Fusarium Wilt of Watermelon by Grafting onto Bottlegourd or Interspecific Hybrid Squash Despite Colonization of Rootstocks by Fusarium								PLANT DISEASE				98	2			255	266		10.1094/PDIS-01-13-0100-RE			FEB 2014	2014	Grafting watermelon (Citrullus lanatus var. lanatus) onto rootstocks of interspecific hybrid squash (Cucurbita moschata x C. maxima), bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria), or citron (Citrullus lanatus var. citroides) has been used in Asia and Israel to mange Fusarium wilt of watermelon caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum. The objectives of this study were to determine the frequency of infection of six rootstocks by E oxysporum f. sp. niveum races 1 and 2 and the field performance of grafted rootstocks in Charleston, SC. Grafted and nongrafted watermelon and rootstock plants were inoculated in the greenhouse with race 1, race 2, or water (the control treatment). With both races, the frequency of recovery of E oxysporum from scion and rootstock portions of inoculated watermelon plants grafted onto 'Ojakkyo' citron was greater than from watermelon plants grafted onto 'Shintosa Camel' and 'Strong Tosa' interspecific hybrid squash, and from plants grafted onto 'Emphasis', 'Macis', and 'WMXP 3945' bottlegourd. For nongrafted plants inoculated with race 1, percent recovery also was greater from Ojakkyo than from interspecific hybrid squash and bottlegourd. For nongrafted plants inoculated with race 2, E oxysporum was recovered from the base of >= 79% of all inoculated plants. More than two-thirds (15) of 21 isolates recovered from the tops or scions of inoculated plants were pathogenic on watermelon. In spring 2010 and 2011, the six rootstocks were grafted with seedless watermelon 'Tri-X 313', which is susceptible to both races, and transplanted in a field infested with races 1 and 2 of E oxysporum f. sp. niveum. Disease incidence for nongrafted and self-grafted Tri-X 313 (the control treatments) and Tri-X 313 grafted onto Ojakkyo citron did not differ significantly. Grafted watermelon plants produced greater weights and numbers of fruit than plants of the two control treatments. Nonpathogenic isolates of E oxysporum and isolates of E oxysporum f. sp. niveum colonized interspecific hybrid squash, bottlegourd, and grafted watermelon. The rootstocks evaluated, however, restricted movement of E oxysporum f. sp. niveum into the watermelon scion, suppressed wilt symptoms, and increased fruit yields in an infested field.									7	0	0	4	1	7			0191-2917	1943-7692		WOS:000330081200011		
J	Pallipuram, Vivek K.; Smith, Melissa C.; Raut, Nimisha; Ren, Xiaoyu								A regression-based performance prediction framework for synchronous iterative algorithms on general purpose graphical processing unit clusters								CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE				26	2			532	560		10.1002/cpe.3017			FEB 2014	2014	Heterogeneous performance prediction models are valuable tools to accurately predict application runtime, allowing for efficient design space exploration and application mapping. The existing performance models require intricate system architecture knowledge, making the modeling task difficult. In this research, we propose a regression-based performance prediction framework for general purpose graphical processing unit (GPGPU) clusters that statistically abstracts the system architecture characteristics, enabling performance prediction without detailed system architecture knowledge. The regression-based framework targets deterministic synchronous iterative algorithms using our synchronous iterative GPGPU execution model and is broken into two components: the computation component that models the GPGPU device and host computations and the communication component that models the network-level communications. The computation component regression models use algorithm characteristics such as the number of floating-point operations and total bytes as predictor variables and are trained using several small, instrumented executions of synchronous iterative algorithms that include a range of floating-point operations-to-byte requirements. The regression models for network-level communications are developed using micro-benchmarks and employ data transfer size and processor count as predictor variables. Our performance prediction framework achieves prediction accuracy over 90% compared with the actual implementations for several tested GPGPU cluster configurations. The end goal of this research is to offer the scientific computing community, an accurate and easy-to-use performance prediction framework that empowers users to optimally utilize the heterogeneous resources.

Because malignancy is a major cause of death and reduced lifespan in mice, the goal of this investigation was to examine the role of AC5KO in protecting against cancer. There have been numerous discoveries in genetically engineered mice over the past several decades, but few have been translated to the bedside. One major reason is that it is difficult to alter a gene in patients, but rather a pharmacological approach is more appropriate. The current investigation employs a parallel construction to examine the extent to which inhibiting AC5, either in a genetic knockout (KO) or by a specific pharmacological inhibitor protects against cancer. This study is unique, not only because a combined genetic and pharmacological approach is rare, but also there are no prior studies on the extent to which AC5 affects cancer. We found that AC5KO delayed age-related tumor incidence significantly, as well as protecting against mammary tumor development in AC5KOx MMTV-HER-2 neu mice, and B16F10 melanoma tumor growth, which can explain why AC5KO is a model of longevity. In addition, a Food and Drug Administration approved antiviral agent, adenine 9--D-arabinofuranoside (Vidarabine or AraAde), which specifically inhibits AC5, reduces LP07 lung and B16F10 melanoma tumor growth in syngeneic mice. Thus, inhibition of AC5 is a previously unreported mechanism for prevention of cancers associated with aging and that can be targeted by an available pharmacologic inhibitor, with potential consequent extension of lifespan.									5	0	0	5	0	5			1474-9718	1474-9726		WOS:000329760600012	23957304	
J	Luitel, Bipul; Venayagamoorthy, Ganesh Kumar								Cellular computational networks-A scalable architecture for learning the dynamics of large networked systems								NEURAL NETWORKS				50				120	123		10.1016/j.neunet.2013.11.001			FEB 2014	2014	Neural networks for implementing large networked systems such as smart electric power grids consist of multiple inputs and outputs. Many outputs lead to a greater number of parameters to be adapted. Each additional variable increases the dimensionality of the problem and hence learning becomes a challenge. Cellular computational networks (CCNs) are a class of sparsely connected dynamic recurrent networks (DRNs). By proper selection of a set of input elements for each output variable in a given application, a DRN can be modified into a CCN which significantly reduces the complexity of the neural network and allows use of simple training methods for independent learning in each cell thus making it scalable. This article demonstrates this concept of developing a CCN using dimensionality reduction in a DRN for scalability and better performance. The concept has been analytically explained and empirically verified through application. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Since 2011, the number of published Prunus QTLs and MTLs has doubled. With increased genomic resources, such as whole genome sequences and high-density genotyping platforms, trait loci analysis can be more readily converted to markers that can be directly utilized in marker-assisted breeding. To provide this important resource to the community and to integrate it with other genomic, genetic, and breeding data, a global review of the QTLs and MTLs linked to agronomic traits in Prunus has been performed and the data made available in the Genome Database for Rosaceae. We describe detailed information on 760 main QTLs and MTLs linked to a total of 110 agronomic traits related to tree development, pest and disease resistance, flowering, ripening, and fruit and seed quality. Access to these trait loci enables the application of this information in the post-genomic era, characterized by the availability of a high-quality peach reference genome and new high-throughput DNA and RNA analysis technologies.									11	0	0	9	1	11			0735-9640	1572-9818		WOS:000329941500001

Genotypic and Phenotypic Diversity of Cherry Species Collected in Serbia								PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTER				32	1			92	108		10.1007/s11105-013-0601-4			FEB 2014	2014	Genetic diversity of cherry species collected in Serbia has been investigated using 26 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers developed in Prunus. This material consisted of 77 cherry accessions corresponding to the five following species, Prunus cerasus, Prunus avium, Prunus fruticosa, Prunus mahaleb, and Prunus serrulata. A total of 98 alleles were detected, with an average of 3.7 putative alleles per primer combination. Sixteen unique, species-specific, alleles were detected with nine primer pairs in four species, P. avium, P. cerasus, P. mahaleb, and P. serrulata. The highest number of unique alleles, 8, was observed in P. mahaleb and no species-specific alleles were detected in P. fruticosa. SSR markers generated unique fingerprints for all cherry accessions. Cluster analysis classified accessions into four groups according to their taxonomy, where P. avium and P. cerasus were grouped together, supporting P. avium as one of the progenitors of sour cherry. The highest genetic variability and potential value in rootstock breeding was observed in P. mahaleb and P. serrulata material. Principal component (PC) analysis explained more than 50 % of the total observed phenotypic variability using the first two components. The most important characteristics of PC1 were leaf length and width, fruit taste, color of leaf nectaries, fruit weight, leaf blade margin incisions, petiole length, size of vegetative buds, and length of internode. The most important characteristics of PC2 were shape of leaf blade at base, fruit skin color, and leaf blade length and tip angle. The investigated germplasm proved to be sufficiently genetically diverse for use in breeding programs and development of new cherry cultivars and rootstocks.									3	1	0	2	1	5			0735-9640	1572-9818		WOS:000329941500009

Using a whole genome sequencing approach (Illumina platform), we explored polymorphism underlying phenotypic differences among individuals in a peach F-2 cross segregating for chilling requirement and bloom date. Allelic configuration of individuals, which represented phenotypic extremes in the cross (300 vs. 1,100 chill hours) allowed reconstruction of low- and high-chill haplotypes within three most significant quantitative trait locus (QTL) intervals on the Prunus G1, G4, and G7. We detected single nucleotide polymorphic sites (SNPs), small deletions and insertions (DIPs), and large structural variants (SVs) associated with low-chill haplotypes and created a prioritized list of candidate genes based on functionally characterized homologs from Arabidopsis thaliana. Two dormancy associated genes PpeDAM5 and PpeDAM6 are the strongest candidate genes for the major QTL signal at the lower end of G1. Also, key functional genes involved in the Polycomb repressive mechanism, cell cycle progression, and hormone regulation were evident as strong candidate genes underlying QTL intervals in this peach cross.									11	1	0	12	0	12			1614-2942	1614-2950		WOS:000329809300004

The radios of the ad hoc networks we investigate are frequency-agile allowing them the ability to change their carrier frequency and transmission rate over a wide range of possibilities. Our approach to channel access takes advantage of the multiple frequency bands available to the network to increase network-layer performance. We have previously found that in some network scenarios, the best network-layer performance is achieved if the channel-access protocol always selects the channel with the fastest data rate that is immediately available. However, in other network scenarios it is preferable to always wait for a channel with a faster data rate that is temporarily unavailable to become available rather than select a channel with a slower data rate that is immediately available. We show that our new channel-access protocol is able to adapt the strategy for selecting channels so that high network-layer performance is maintained in all scenarios compared to channel-access protocols that utilize either fixed strategy.

Addition of potassium carbonate to continuous cultures of mixed ruminal bacteria shifts volatile fatty acids and daily production of biohydrogenation intermediates								JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE				97	2			975	984		10.3168/jds.2013-7164			FEB 2014	2014	A recent study reported a 0.4 percentage unit increase in milk fat of lactating dairy cattle when dietary K was increased from 1.2 to 2% with potassium carbonate. Because milk fat yield has been associated with ruminal production of certain conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomers, 2 studies were conducted to determine if increasing potassium carbonate in the rumen would alter patterns of fermentation and biohydrogenation. In experiment 1, 5 dual-flow continuous fermenters were injected just before each feeding with a 10% (wt/ wt) stock potassium carbonate solution to provide the equivalent of 1.1 (K1), 2.2 (K2), and 3.3 (K3) % of diet dry matter (DM) as added K. One of the remaining fermenters received no K (KO) and the last fermenter (NaOH) was injected with adequate NaOH stock solution (10%, wt/wt) to match the pH observed for the K3 treatment. For experiment 2, 6 dual-flow continuous fermenters were used to evaluate 6 treatments arranged in a 2 x 3 factorial to examine 2 levels of soybean oil (0 and 3.64% of diet DM) and added K at 0, 1.6, and 3.3% of diet DM. In both experiments, fermenters were fed 55 to 57 g of DM/d of a typical dairy diet consisting of 1:1 forage (10% alfalfa hay and 90% corn silage) to concentrate mix in 2 equal portions at 0800 and 1630 h, and fed the respective diets for 10-d periods. Potassium carbonate addition increased pH in both experiments. Acetate:propionate ratio and pH in experiment 1 increased linearly for KO to K3. Acetate:propionate ratio was lower for NaOH compared with K3 but the pH was the same. The trans-11 18:1 and cis-9,trans-11 CLA production rates (mg/d) increased linearly from KO to K3, but K3 and NaOH did not differ. Production of trans-10 18:1 decreased and that of trans-10,cis-12 tended to decrease from KO to K3, but production of trans-10, cis-12 CLA remained high for NaOH. Addition of K to the cultures in experiment 2 decreased propionate and increased acetate and acetate:propionate ratio for the 0% fat diet but not for the 3.64% fat diet. Addition of K increased stearic acid and cis-9,trans-11 CLA but decreased daily production of trans-10 C18:1 and trans-10, cis-12 CLA. The results indicate that increasing potassium carbonate in the diet shifts both fermentation and biohydrogenation pathways toward higher milk fat percentage in dairy cows, but the effects are only explained in part by elevation of pH.									4	0	0	4	0	4			0022-0302	1525-3198		WOS:000329562800042	24359822	
J	Baier, Scott L.; Bergstrand, Jeffrey H.; Mariutto, Ronald								Economic Determinants of Free Trade Agreements Revisited: Distinguishing Sources of Interdependence								REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS				22	1			31	58		10.1111/roie.12095			FEB 2014	2014	One of the most notable international economic events since 1990 has been the enormous increase in the number of free trade agreements (FTAs). While Baier and Bergstrand were the first to show empirically the impact of a country-pair's economic characteristics on the likelihood of the pair having an FTA, the literature has been extended to demonstrate the importance empirically of FTA interdependencethe effect of other FTAs on the probability of a pair having an FTA. In the context of the Baier-Bergstrand framework, this paper delves deeper into the sources of interdependencean own-FTA effect and a cross-FTA effect. The authors argue that the own-FTA effect (the impact on the net welfare gains of an FTA between two countries owing to either already having other FTAs) likely dwarfs the cross-FTA effect (the impact on the net welfare gains of an FTA between the pair owing to other FTAs existing in the rest of the world, or ROW). Augmenting a parsimonious logit model with simple multilateral FTA and ROW FTA terms to differentiate the own and cross effects empirically, it is shown that the marginal impact on the probability of a country-pair having an agreement of either country having one more FTA with a third country is 50 times that of one more FTA between another pair in ROW. The results suggest that domino (own-FTA) effects have far exceeded competitive liberalization (cross-FTA) effects in the proliferation of FTAs.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0965-7576	1467-9396		WOS:000329547000011

Maintaining a socially responsible reputation and developing ads that are emotional and likable are tactics used to encourage donations. This study explores the role of religiosity as a moderator of antecedents to intent to donate to the nonprofit sponsor of pro-social ads and finds that religiosity acts as a moderator in the relationship between liking of the ad, perceived corporate social responsibility of the nonprofit, and intent to donate to the nonprofit. Managerial implications suggest that nonprofits employing negative emotional appeals in advertising should (1) feature real victims (not actors) to generate empathy and (2) target more religious individuals through demographic and psychographic segmentations.

However, it is a big challenge for efficient scheduling algorithm design and implementation (as general scheduling problem is NP-complete). Most existing task-scheduling methods of cloud computing only consider task resource requirements for CPU and memory, without considering bandwidth requirements. In order to obtain better performance, in this paper, we propose a bandwidth-aware algorithm for divisible task scheduling in cloud-computing environments. A nonlinear programming model for the divisible task-scheduling problem under the bounded multi-port model is presented. By solving this model, the optimized allocation scheme that determines proper number of tasks assigned to each virtual resource node is obtained. On the basis of the optimized allocation scheme, a heuristic algorithm for divisible load scheduling, called bandwidth-aware task-scheduling (BATS) algorithm, is proposed. The performance of algorithm is evaluated using CloudSim toolkit. Experimental result shows that, compared with the fair-based task-scheduling algorithm, the bandwidth-only task-scheduling algorithm, and the computation-only task-scheduling algorithm, the proposed algorithm (BATS) has better performance.

Assessing the breeding potential of day-neutral converted racestock germplasm in the Pee Dee cotton germplasm enhancement program								EUPHYTICA				195	3			453	465		10.1007/s10681-013-1007-y			FEB 2014	2014	The primitive, upland cotton landrace collection represents one of the untapped genetic resources in cotton breeding programs. Efforts to utilize these resources have been slow, but the development of day-neutral converted germplasm lines offers tremendous potential for broadening the genetic base in upland cotton. Using topcross hybrids involving elite germplasm from the unique Pee Dee germplasm enhancement program, we evaluated the breeding potential of a select number of day-neutral converted racestocks. The mean performance of parental lines and F-2 topcross hybrids along with genetic effect estimates indicate that day-neutral converted germplasm lines decreased agronomic performance while increasing fiber quality performance. Results suggest that crosses between day-neutral converted racestocks and elite Pee Dee germplasm lines result in new allelic combinations associated with improved fiber quality performance that interact in a non-additive way. However, it appears that converted racestocks transmit negatively correlated alleles for agronomic performance and fiber quality. These negatively correlated allelic combinations present a major challenge for cotton breeding programs. Future efforts that incorporate DNA based selection methods to identify and fix introgressed segments from converted racestocks and their offspring should enhance the use of the genetic variation present in the primitive racestock germplasm accessions.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0014-2336	1573-5060		WOS:000328319300011

As only a few Metazoan genomes are approaching finished quality (human, mouse, fly and worm), there is room for improvement of most genome assemblies. The honey bee (Apis mellifera) genome, published in 2006, was noted for its bimodal GC content distribution that affected the quality of the assembly in some regions and for fewer genes in the initial gene set (OGSv1.0) compared to what would be expected based on other sequenced insect genomes.Results: Here, we report an improved honey bee genome assembly (Amel_4.5) with a new gene annotation set (OGSv3.2), and show that the honey bee genome contains a number of genes similar to that of other insect genomes, contrary to what was suggested in OGSv1.0. The new genome assembly is more contiguous and complete and the new gene set includes similar to 5000 more protein-coding genes, 50% more than previously reported. About 1/6 of the additional genes were due to improvements to the assembly, and the remaining were inferred based on new RNAseq and protein data.Conclusions: Lessons learned from this genome upgrade have important implications for future genome sequencing projects. Furthermore, the improvements significantly enhance genomic resources for the honey bee, a key model for social behavior and essential to global ecology through pollination.									83	2	0	82	1	84			1471-2164			WOS:000331116900002	24479613

The delivery platform contains a peptide-drug conjugate covalently tethered to the hydrogel matrix, which in the presence of the appropriate protease, was cleaved and the drug released into the bathing environment. This platform was developed and investigated in silico using a finite element modeling (FEM) approach. Firstly, the primary governing phenomena guiding drug release profiles were investigated, and it was confirmed that under transportlimited conditions, the diffusion of the enzyme within the hydrogel and the coupled enzyme kinetics accurately model the system and are in agreement with published results. Secondly, the FEM model was used to investigate the release of a competitive protease inhibitor, MAG283, via cleavage of AcetylPro-Leu-GlylLeu-MAG-283 by MMP9 in order to achieve targeted homeostasis of MMP-9 activity, such as in the pathophysiology of chronic wounds, via closed-loop feedback control. The key engineering parameters for the delivery device are the radii of the hydrogel microspheres and the concentration of the peptide-inhibitor conjugate. Homeostatic drug delivery, where the focus turns away from the drug release rate and turns toward achieving targeted control of biochemical activity within a biochemical pathway, is an emerging approach in drug delivery methodologies for which the potential has not yet been fully realized.

Quantifying and simulating stormwater runoff in watersheds								HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES				28	3			559	569		10.1002/hyp.9616			JAN 30 2014	2014	We developed the Stormwater Runoff Modeling System (SWARM) based on curve number and unit hydrograph methods of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service. SWARM models single events, targets watersheds fitting easily within hydrologic units with 12-digit codes, and has been calibrated for low-gradient topography of the Southeast coastal plain. We established protocols; made changes related to peak rate factors, travel time formulas, curve numbers, and the initial abstraction ratio; and then tested the output with multi-site validation using U.S. Geological Survey measurements of discharge and rainfall. Validation results from both undeveloped and developed watersheds support the robustness of our system in quantifying and simulating runoff: rainfall to runoff differences between measured and simulated volumes ranged from 3 to 11%; r(2) for hydrograph curves ranged from 0.82 to 0.98. SWARM can be a useful tool for scientific research and for coastal resource management and decision making in the Southeast coastal plain specifically and also may be applied to other areas by recalibrating parameters and modifying calculation templates.

The crystal structure of this compound contains pseudo-one-dimensional [Fe2O6](infinity) sawtoothlike chains, formed by corner-sharing isosceles triangles of Fe3+ ions occupying two nonequivalent crystallographic sites. The chains extend infinitely along the crystallographic b axis and are structurally confined from one another via diamagnetic (AsO4)(3-) units along the a axis and Rb+ cations along the c-axis direction. Neutron-diffraction measurements indicate the onset of a long-range antiferromagnetic order below approximately 25 K. The magnetic structure consists of ferrimagnetic chains which are antiferromagnetically coupled with each other. Within each chain, one of the two Fe sites carries a moment which lies along the b axis, while the second site bears a canted moment in the opposite direction. Externally applied magnetic field induces a transition to a ferrimagnetic state, in which the coupling between the sawtooth chains becomes ferromagnetic. Magnetization measurements performed on optically aligned single crystals reveal evidence for an uncompensated magnetization at low magnetic fields that could emerge from a phase-segregated state with ferrimagnetic inclusions or from antiferromagnetic domain walls. The observed magnetic states and the competition between them are expected to arise from strongly frustrated interactions within the sawtooth chains and relatively weak coupling between them.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1098-0121	1550-235X		WOS:000332294600005

To date, there have been relatively few field-scale studies or laboratory-based studies on environmentally relevant soils examining the chemical/physical behavior of the NPs following release into natural systems. The objective of this research is to demonstrate the behavior and transformations of iron oxide and silver NPs with different capping ligands within the unsaturated zone. Here, we show that NP transport within the vadose zone is minimal primarily due to heteroaggregation with soil surface coatings with results that > 99 % of the NPs remained within 5 cm of the original source after 1 year in intermediate-scale field lysimeters. These results suggest that transport may be overestimated when compared to previous laboratory-scale studies on pristine soils and pure minerals and that future work must incorporate more environmentally relevant parameters.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1388-0764	1572-896X		WOS:000330795900001

In this study, the antihypertensive effect of peptide RVPSL from egg protein has been evaluated by an in vivo model. In addition, the mRNA levels of renin, AT1 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), and AT2 receptor in the rat kidney were investigated through real-time polymerase chain reaction. The Ang I, Ang II, renin, and aldosterone concentrations of serum were also measured. Our results indicated that the blood pressure of the spontaneously hypertensive rats administered RVPSL for 4 weeks decreased significantly compared to that of the negative group. The mRNA levels of renin, ACE, and AT1 receptor in kidney also decreased significantly. The serum Ang II, renin, and aldosterone concentrations of the treatment group were reduced in comparison to. those of the negative group. It is hoped this study will help our understanding and potential use of RVPSL in the treatment or prevention of hypertension.									12	3	0	8	0	15			0021-8561	1520-5118		WOS:000330598700013	24404915

Diamagnetic particle concentration has been demonstrated in magnetic fluids using two repulsive or attracting magnets, which in almost all cases are symmetrically positioned on the two sides of the particle-flowing channel. This work studies the effects of magnet asymmetry on the pattern and flow rate of diamagnetic particle concentration in ferrofluid flow through a straight rectangular microchannel. Two attracting permanent magnets with a fixed distance are each embedded on one side of the microchannel with a symmetric or an asymmetric configuration. A pair of symmetric counter-rotating circulations of concentrated particles is formed in the microchannel with a symmetric magnet configuration, which is found to grow in size and progress up the flow. In contrast, the single asymmetric circulation of concentrated particles formed in the microchannel with an asymmetric magnet configuration nearly maintains its size and position. Moreover, the magnet asymmetry is found to increase the ferrofluid flow rate for particle trapping, which is predicted by a three-dimensional theoretical model with a reasonable agreement.

Sequenced in 2009, a comprehensive annotation of the sorghum genome and the development of functional genomics resources is key to enable the discovery and deployment of regulatory and metabolic genes and gene networks for crop improvement.Results: This study utilizes the first commercially available whole-transcriptome sorghum microarray (Sorgh-WTa520972F) to identify tissue and genotype-specific expression patterns for all identified Sorghum bicolor exons and UTRs. The genechip contains 1,026,373 probes covering 149,182 exons (27,577 genes) across the Sorghum bicolor nuclear, chloroplast, and mitochondrial genomes. Specific probesets were also included for putative non-coding RNAs that may play a role in gene regulation (e. g., microRNAs), and confirmed functional small RNAs in related species (maize and sugarcane) were also included in our array design. We generated expression data for 78 samples with a combination of four different tissue types (shoot, root, leaf and stem), two dissected stem tissues (pith and rind) and six diverse genotypes, which included 6 public sorghum lines (R159, Atlas, Fremont, PI152611, AR2400 and PI455230) representing grain, sweet, forage, and high biomass ideotypes.Conclusions: Here we present a summary of the microarray dataset, including analysis of tissue-specific gene expression profiles and associated expression profiles of relevant metabolic pathways. With an aim to enable identification and functional characterization of genes in sorghum, this expression atlas presents a new and valuable resource to the research community.									18	0	0	16	0	19			1471-2229			WOS:000334472000001	24456189

High-density SNP array analysis performed on siblings first described with this syndrome detected four shared regions of loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Whole-exome sequencing narrowed the candidate region to chromosome 2p11.2. Sanger sequencing confirmed a homozygous c.994G>A transition (p.E332K) in the ST3GAL5 gene, which encodes for a sialyltransferase also known as GM3 synthase. A different homozygous mutation of this gene has been previously associated with infantile-onset epilepsy syndromes in two other cohorts. The ST3GAL5 enzyme synthesizes ganglioside GM3, a glycosophingolipid enriched in neural tissue, by adding sialic acid to lactosylceramide. Unlike disorders of glycosphingolipid (GSL) degradation, very little is known regarding the molecular and pathophysiologic consequences of altered GSL biosynthesis. Glycolipid analysis confirmed a complete lack of GM3 ganglioside in patient fibroblasts, while microarray analysis of glycosyltransferase mRNAs detected modestly increased expression of ST3GAL5 and greater changes in transcripts encoding enzymes that lie downstream of ST3GAL5 and in other GSL biosynthetic pathways. Comprehensive glycomic analysis of N-linked, O-linked and GSL glycans revealed collateral alterations in response to loss of complex gangliosides in patient fibroblasts and in zebrafish embryos injected with antisense morpholinos that targeted zebrafish st3gal5 expression. Morphant zebrafish embryos also exhibited increased apoptotic cell death in multiple brain regions, emphasizing the importance of GSL expression in normal neural development and function.									26	0	0	22	0	26			0964-6906	1460-2083		WOS:000330840400012	24026681

The polyelectrolyte on the outer surface of nanophosphors also provided an amine tag for PEGylation. This method is also employed to fabricate PEGylated magnetic upconversion phosphors with Fe3O4 as the core and -NaGdF4 as a shell. These magnetic upconversion nanophosphors have relatively high saturation magnetization (7.0 emu g(-1)) and magnetic susceptibility (1.7 x 10(-2) emu g(-1) Oe(-1)), providing them with large magnetophoretic mobilities. The magnetic properties for separation and controlled release in flow, their optical properties for cell labeling, deep tissue imaging, and their T-1- and T-2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) relaxivities are studied. The magnetic upconversion phosphors display both strong magnetophoresis, dual MRI imaging (r(1) = 2.9 mM(-1) s(-1), r(2) = 204 mM(-1) s(-1)), and bright luminescence under 1 cm chicken breast tissue.									28	3	0	7	0	30			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000330624400019	23828629

Eighty-six aroma compounds were identified, including 5 acids, 34 esters, 10 alcohols, 9 aldehydes, 4 ketones, 4 phenols, and 10 nitrous and sulfuric compounds. To investigate possible correlation between aroma compounds identified by GC-MS and sensory attributes, multivariate ANOVA-PLSR (APLSR) was performed. It turned out that there were 30 volatile composition, ethyl acetate, ethyl propanoate, ethyl 2-methyl butanoate, ethyl 3-methyl butanoate, ethyl lactate, ethyl benzenacetate, 3-methylbutyl acetate, hexyl acetate, 3-methyl-1-butanol, 1-heptanol, phenylethyl alcohol, acetaldehyde, 1,1-diethoxy-3-methyl butane, furfural, benzaldehyde, 5-methyl-2-furanal, 2-octanone, 2-n-butyl furan, dimethyl trisulfied and 2,6-dimethyl pyrazine, ethyl nonanoate, isopentyl hexanoate, octanoic acid, ethyl 5-methyl hexanoate, 2-phenylethyl acetate,ethyl oleate, propyl hexanoate, butanoic acid and phenol, ethyl benzenepropanoate, which showed good coordination with Chinese liquor characteristics. The multivariate structure of this electronic nose responses was then processed by principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). According to the obtained results, GC-MS and electronic nose can be used for the differentiation of the liquor origins and flavor types. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Thin-film composite membranes are a promising technology for carbon capture; however, only membranes with high and stable permeance (> 3000 GPO) and moderate CO2/N-2 selectivity (> 20) potentially could decrease CO2 capture costs to $20US/ton. In many cases, practical problems such as membrane plasticization and physical aging rule out promising new materials from commercial consideration. The present contribution is part of a larger effort to develop fundamental structure property relationships for perfluorocyclobutyl(PFCB) polymers that provide a foundation for PFCB-based membranes with resistance to plasticization and physical aging. A focus of this part of the study was to develop procedures to fabricate PFCB thin film composite membranes with reproducible performance characteristics. Biphenylvinylether-perfluorocyclobutyl (BPVE-PFCB) polymer was used as a model for the family of PFCB polymers. The thickness of the PFCB selective layer was controlled by changing processing conditions. Results show that uniform PFCB layers were coated successfully on support membranes to produce thin film composites with reproducible permeance and selectivity values. Membranes prepared with the thinnest BPVE-PFCB films yielded CO2 permeance of 1000 GPU with CO2/N-2 selectivity around 15. Estimated CO2 permeance through the PFCB thin layer alone was up to 1700 GPO, with CO2/N-2 selectivity close to the bulk film intrinsic selectivity of 20. The use of other PFCB polymers and copolymers with superior separation characteristics may be used to prepare composite membranes with improved performance. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This relationship yields a unique curve, which is only sensitive to the aerodynamic properties of the bluff body, but is, otherwise, invariant under any changes in the mechanical and electrical design parameters of the harvester. The curve permits a simple and direct comparative analysis of the energy harvesting performance of different bluff bodies so long that the other design parameters are kept constant. The universal curve is also shown to facilitate the optimization analysis, thereby providing significant insight into the optimal performance conditions.

In the quantum mechanical regime, the theory reproduces the well-known eikonal approximation for elastic collisions, provides a simple and useful expression for single-phonon inelastic scattering, and leads to further expressions for multiple-phonon transfers. In the classical limit, the theory produces an expression that includes the effects of surface corrugation in addition to the excitations of large numbers of phonons. This theory shows that a simple measurement of the most probable intensity of energy-resolved scattering spectra taken as a function of surface temperature, with all other experimentally controllable parameters held fixed, can be used to extract the surface corrugation amplitude. Comparisons with data for Ar scattering from the molten metals Ga and In show good agreement with the measured energy-resolved spectra, the in-plane angular distributions, the out-of-plane angular distributions, and produces values for the corrugation amplitudes that range from 10% to 30% of the average interparticle spacing.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1098-0121	1550-235X		WOS:000332204000010		
J	Gonzalez-Pereyra, Nestor G.; Glasgow, William; Parenzan, Alexander; Sharp, Julia L.; Mefford, O. Thompson								Investigation of the Etching of Silicon under Subcritical Water Conditions								INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH				53	1			173	181		10.1021/ie4024337			JAN 8 2014	2014	Herein, we present a study investigating the reaction conditions to wet etch monocrystalline silicon in the subcritical region of water, specifically from 200 to 300 degrees C. In the subcritical region there is a departure of thermodynamic, transport, and chemical properties from normal conditions. This has the potential to affect the reaction paths for the dissolution of silicon, by modifying the local concentration of reactants and products, by altering the relative activation energy of different reactions, or by changing the polarity of the water. Furthermore, our methodology uses concentrations of etching agent markedly lower than previous works (our reactions were conducted at [KOH] = 0.03-0.7%/wt). The results of the study suggest that dilute etchant solutions at high temperatures can produce results comparable to those reported at atmospheric conditions using higher concentrations of etchants. Based on the results obtained, the main key factors in the etch rates were crystallographic orientation of the wafer, composition of the etching solution, and temperature.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0888-5885			WOS:000329586100020		
J	Terry, William C.								The perfect worker: discursive makings of Filipinos in the workplace hierarchy of the globalized cruise industry								SOCIAL & CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY				15	1			73	93		10.1080/14649365.2013.864781			JAN 2 2014	2014	Filipinos are by far the largest nationality represented on cruise ships despite the fact that cruise lines can hire from wherever they choose. The reasons for this phenomenon lie in a melange of political, economic, and cultural factors, yet when polled, industry insiders repeatedly cite well-worn Filipino stereotypes as the primary cause. This reflects a system in which discourses surrounding workers become fixed in ways that ideologically frame Filipinos as docile and compliant yet industrious and inexpensive. Filipinos are thus constructed as readymade workers for subordinate positions rather than for roles as leaders on the ship. This case shows the subtle ways that labor becomes stratified along ethnic lines and how discourses become the fault lines that define and reproduce the great inequalities between different groups of workers. The task of this article is to understand the ways that discourses relate to the workplace positioning of Filipino seafarers and reinforce a reading of Filipino-ness' that marks them as the perfect sort of worker for the cruise lines. It is further suggested that such framings are subject to revision via worker agency and changing socioeconomic labor market conditions.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1464-9365	1470-1197		WOS:000328672500004		
J	Pury, Cynthia L.

Interviews of 32 active duty US Army personnel about their process of seeking current mental health care were analyzed for themes of voluntary action, personal risk, and noble or worthwhile goals (benefits). Risks and benefits were divided into internal risks and benefits, characteristic of psychological courage; and external risks and benefits, characteristic of moral courage. Concerns about external risks were themes in all narratives, while concerns about internal risks were themes in only about half of narratives. Both internal and external benefits of treatment were themes in approximately three-quarters of the narratives, whereas doubts about internal (but not external) benefits were also expressed at a similar rate. Thus, participants described an act of blended courage, with social risks of moral courage taken for wellness goals of psychological courage.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1743-9760	1743-9779		WOS:000327834300003

R			Clemson University						Prunus persica var. persica strain:evergrowing Transcriptome or Gene expression								European Nucleotide Archive														2016-03-18	2014	Rooted peach cuttings were grown in a greenhouse for two months at 25 A°C under long days (LD, 16 h light/8 h dark). Cuttings were derived from wild type individuals in the F2 population described in Jimenez et al. 2010. Plants were transferred to a growth room for two weeks of acclimation under LD, then shifted to SD conditions (8 h light/16 h dark) for two weeks. In the growth room, 250-300 Imol m-2 s-1 of light was provided at canopy height by AgroSunA Gold 1000W sodium/halide lamps (Agrosun Inc, New York, NY, USA). Temperatures averaged 22.5A°C (light) to 18.7A°C (dark), and relative humidity ranged between 48% and 55%. Plants were watered every two days as needed. At 0, 1, and 2 weeks after the transfer to SD, apical tips (youngest leaves and shoot apical meristems) from eight replicate plants per week were harvested and pooled for RNA extraction. The current project contains six RNAseq samples: wild type at 0,1, and 2 weeks and evergrowing mutant at 0,1, and 2 weeks. The evergrowing mutant does not cease growth in response to short days.									0	0	0	0	0	0						DRCI:DATA2016175009568600

The majority of reads derive from cotton genes, but nematode genes are also present. Transcriptome or Gene expression								European Nucleotide Archive														2016-03-18	2014	The semi-endoparasitic reniform nematode (Rotylenchulus reniformis) is a major yield-limiting pest of multiple crops in the tropics and sub-tropics, including upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum). Reniform-resistant cotton varieties are urgently needed, but genes that confer resistance to reniform nematode have not been identified in any species. Parasitism by reniform nematode involves significant developmental changes in plant roots, leading to the formation of multicellular feeding structures called syncytia. Here we provide raw RNAseq reads from syncitial and non-syncitial cotton roots collected on three sampling dates across a 12-day time course.									0	0	0	0	0	0						DRCI:DATA2016173009557521

IEEE					Harmonic Detection of Resonance Method								2014 IEEE 14TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NANOTECHNOLOGY (IEEE-NANO)								188	191					2014	2014	Electromechanical resonators in the micro (MEMS) and nano (NEMS) regimes have emerged as promising tools for use in diverse applications such as ultrasensitive physical, chemical, and biological sensors, with detection limits as low as a single molecule. The advent of state-of-the-art micro-fabrication techniques has enabled a high throughput platform for commercialization. However, the sensitivity and reliability of such devices are highly dependent on the employed detection technique. We present a highly useful yet simple electrical detection scheme: the Harmonic Detection of Resonance (HDR) method. The prominent HDR features will be discussed and applications ranging from the use of micro-cantilevers as sensors to probing mechanical properties in nano-cantilever systems will be presented.					14th IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology (IEEE-NANO)14th IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology (IEEE-NANO)	AUG 14-21, 2014AUG 14-21, 2014	IEEEIEEE	Toronto, CANADAToronto, CANADA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4799-5622-7	WOS:000365620600043

The proposed system is guaranteed to recover from an unlimited number of transient faults (e.g., state corruption). We provide a complexity analysis of the recovery (stabilization) time of the system after arbitrary failures in the network. Also, we show that the system always remains alive and starvation free. Nodes can form multiple logical layers depending on the topics of interest; the framework provides flexibility to dynamically configure the layers to provide time space tradeoff.					6th International Symposium on Parallel Architectures, Algorithms, and Programming (PAAP)6th International Symposium on Parallel Architectures, Algorithms, and Programming (PAAP)	JUL 13-15, 2014JUL 13-15, 2014	IEEE Comp Soc; IEEE Tech Comm Parallel Proc; Natl Nat Sci FdnChina; Beijing Jiaotong UnivIEEE Comp Soc; IEEE Tech Comm Parallel Proc; Natl Nat Sci FdnChina; Beijing Jiaotong Univ	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINABeijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0			2168-3034		978-1-4799-3844-5	WOS:000365606900003

F1000Research				3				298	298		10.12688/f1000research.5919.1			2014	2014	The medium pH level of plant tissue culture has been shown to be essential to many aspects of explant development and growth. Sensitivity or tolerance of medium pH change in vitro varies accordingly to specific requirements of individual species. The objectives of this study are to 1) determine medium pH change over time in storage conditions and with presence of explants, 2) evaluate the effects of medium pH change and explant growth performance and 3) assess the effects of adding a pH stabilizer, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) to Douglas-fir micropropagation medium. Spring buds, collected before breaking dormancy from juvenile and mature donor trees were utilized for these evaluations. Medium with or without MES, each at five medium pH levels was pre-adjusted before adding MES, agar and autoclaving. Medium pH changes and explant growth parameters were measured at eight different incubation times. In general, medium with MES provided a more stable medium pH compared to pre-adjusted pH values under two storage conditions as well as with presence of explants over time. A general trend of decreasing medium pH over time was found comparing explants from juvenile and mature donor genotypes. Explant height and weight growth increased over time, but differ among explants from juvenile and mature donor genotypes. MES may help to maintain stable medium pH for bulk medium preparation. Our findings suggested a 21-day subculture practice may facilitate to sustain medium freshness, medium pH level and desirable explant growth.									0	0	0	0	0	0						MEDLINE:26535110	26535110

The interferometer is used to characterize and analyze DNA molecules, pBluescript (SK+) and pET21a, in similar to 1 nL DI water solutions. The obtained RF sensitivity at similar to 10 GHz is better than similar to 3x10(-15) mol/mL, which is close to the previously reported highest result. DNA molecular compositions are analyzed from RF measurements. The results suggest a new method for DNA solution examinations. We also show that partly damaged DNA molecules exhibit significant dielectric property changes. Additionally, DNA solution dynamics (i.e. relaxation time) is obtained through RF measurements between similar to 2.5 and similar to 10 GHz. Thus, the RF technique is promising for sensing and identification applications in biology and chemistry.

ASME					LOAD OPTIMIZATION OF A NONLINEAR MONO-STABLE DUFFING-TYPE HARVESTER OPERATING IN A WHITE NOISE ENVIRONMENT								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, 2013, VOL 8										UNSP V008T13A086				2014	2014	This paper investigates electric load optimization of nonlinear mono-stable Duffing energy harvesters subjected to white Gaussian excitations. Both symmetric and asymmetric nonlinear restoring forces are considered. Statistical linearization is utilized to obtain an approximate analytical expression for the optimal load as function of the other systems parameters. It is shown that the optimal load is dependent on the nonlinearity unless the ratio between the harvesting circuit time constant and the period of the mechanical oscillator is very large. Under optimal loading conditions, a harvester with a symmetric nonlinear restoring force can never produce more power than an equivalent linear harvester regardless of the magnitude or nature of the nonlinearity. On the other hand, asymmetries in the restoring force are shown to provide performance enhancement over an equivalent linear harvester.

Smart parking applications that make easier the parking search task can help to reduce this traffic and its associated environmental burden. This paper presents the conceptual modeling phase of ParkinGain, a smart parking application that helps drivers to find and reserve parking spots based on their current needs, using their car HMI system or their smartphone. In addition, the application allows the driver to extend the parking time if needed. Since the cost of deploying smart parking technologies is not negligible, the integration of other value-added services such as digital coupons of nearby merchants can help to subsidize the associated costs related to the adoption of these technologies in parking facilities. Our application is designed to integrate these services, allowing to create a smart parking ecosystem that can also be beneficial to other 'non-parking' related parties such as the aforementioned merchants.					3rd International Conference on Connected Vehicles and Expo (ICCVE)3rd International Conference on Connected Vehicles and Expo (ICCVE)	NOV 03-07, 2014NOV 03-07, 2014	IEEE; IEEE USA; World Acad Connected Vehicles; IEEE Intelligent Transportat Syst Soc; IEEE Vehicular Technol Soc; Transportat Res Board; Transportat Res Board, Standing Comm Intelligent Transportat Syst; Transportat Res Board, Standing Comm Vehicle Highway Automat; Transportat Res Board, Policy & Org Grp; SAE Int; ITS America; Assoc Comp Machinery; Assoc Comp Machinery, Special Interest Grp Spatial Informat; Int Federat Automat Control; Int Federat Automat Control Tech Comm Automot Control; IEEE Stand Assoc; IEEE Consumer Elect Soc; IEEE RFID CommIEEE; IEEE USA; World Acad Connected Vehicles; IEEE Intelligent Transportat Syst Soc; IEEE Vehicular Technol Soc; Transportat Res Board; Transportat Res Board, Standing Comm Intelligent Transportat Syst; Transportat Res Board, Standing Comm Vehicle Highway Automat; Transportat Res Board, Policy & Org Grp; SAE Int; ITS America; Assoc Comp Machinery; Assoc Comp Machinery, Special Interest Grp Spatial Informat; Int Federat Automat Control; Int Federat Automat Control Tech Comm Automot Control; IEEE Stand Assoc; IEEE Consumer Elect Soc; IEEE RFID Comm	Vienna, AUSTRIAVienna, AUSTRIA	0	0	0	0	0	0			2378-1289		978-1-4799-6729-2	WOS:000378931500026

In particular, those used to control the music player. We set up a Wizard-of-Oz experiment in a driving simulator where participants performed the gestures they think they would use to control the functions of the music player. The results of the experiment show a high level of variability in the gestures performed by different drivers for the same function. This could lead to driver distraction as well as user acceptance issues if a gesture vocabulary is ` enforced' in order to use these systems. Thus, vehicle manufacturers should provide solutions to overcome these issues, such as gesture customization.					3rd International Conference on Connected Vehicles and Expo (ICCVE)3rd International Conference on Connected Vehicles and Expo (ICCVE)	NOV 03-07, 2014NOV 03-07, 2014	IEEE; IEEE USA; World Acad Connected Vehicles; IEEE Intelligent Transportat Syst Soc; IEEE Vehicular Technol Soc; Transportat Res Board; Transportat Res Board, Standing Comm Intelligent Transportat Syst; Transportat Res Board, Standing Comm Vehicle Highway Automat; Transportat Res Board, Policy & Org Grp; SAE Int; ITS America; Assoc Comp Machinery; Assoc Comp Machinery, Special Interest Grp Spatial Informat; Int Federat Automat Control; Int Federat Automat Control Tech Comm Automot Control; IEEE Stand Assoc; IEEE Consumer Elect Soc; IEEE RFID CommIEEE; IEEE USA; World Acad Connected Vehicles; IEEE Intelligent Transportat Syst Soc; IEEE Vehicular Technol Soc; Transportat Res Board; Transportat Res Board, Standing Comm Intelligent Transportat Syst; Transportat Res Board, Standing Comm Vehicle Highway Automat; Transportat Res Board, Policy & Org Grp; SAE Int; ITS America; Assoc Comp Machinery; Assoc Comp Machinery, Special Interest Grp Spatial Informat; Int Federat Automat Control; Int Federat Automat Control Tech Comm Automot Control; IEEE Stand Assoc; IEEE Consumer Elect Soc; IEEE RFID Comm	Vienna, AUSTRIAVienna, AUSTRIA	0	0	0	0	0	0			2378-1289		978-1-4799-6729-2	WOS:000378931500140

IEEE					Efficient engineering of safety-critical, software-intensive systems								2014 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONNECTED VEHICLES AND EXPO (ICCVE)		International Conference on Connected Vehicles and Expo						836	841					2014	2014	The transportation ecosystem is currently in a transition phase from non-electrified to electrified, from isolated to connected, and from non-automated to automated. During this transition new disruptive technologies replace existing ones but quickly become obsolete themselves. Safety and efficiency become even more important as the driver has less input into driving decisions and more difficult to achieve since many of these decisions rely on software technologies which are not as familiar to automotive engineers as the usual mechanical solutions. In the rush to deploy solutions with the latest technology the quality of the software can suffer. The objective of this work is to suggest changes needed in current automotive software engineering to meet the levels of quality demanded by autonomous, connected vehicles. One of the biggest changes is that vehicle and infrastructure technology needs to be developed in context. Strategic decisions concerning which technologies to integrate and the development processes to use require an understanding of the emerging markets. The development method outlined here provides an organization with guidance on using ecosystem roadmaps and a high integrity software development process to accommodate emerging technologies and ever shorter product cycles. In part this is accomplished by fitting those technologies into validated architectures and using techniques that detect defects early. The result is an environment in which safety-critical products are developed more effectively and efficiently.					3rd International Conference on Connected Vehicles and Expo (ICCVE)3rd International Conference on Connected Vehicles and Expo (ICCVE)	NOV 03-07, 2014NOV 03-07, 2014	IEEE; IEEE USA; World Acad Connected Vehicles; IEEE Intelligent Transportat Syst Soc; IEEE Vehicular Technol Soc; Transportat Res Board; Transportat Res Board, Standing Comm Intelligent Transportat Syst; Transportat Res Board, Standing Comm Vehicle Highway Automat; Transportat Res Board, Policy & Org Grp; SAE Int; ITS America; Assoc Comp Machinery; Assoc Comp Machinery, Special Interest Grp Spatial Informat; Int Federat Automat Control; Int Federat Automat Control Tech Comm Automot Control; IEEE Stand Assoc; IEEE Consumer Elect Soc; IEEE RFID CommIEEE; IEEE USA; World Acad Connected Vehicles; IEEE Intelligent Transportat Syst Soc; IEEE Vehicular Technol Soc; Transportat Res Board; Transportat Res Board, Standing Comm Intelligent Transportat Syst; Transportat Res Board, Standing Comm Vehicle Highway Automat; Transportat Res Board, Policy & Org Grp; SAE Int; ITS America; Assoc Comp Machinery; Assoc Comp Machinery, Special Interest Grp Spatial Informat; Int Federat Automat Control; Int Federat Automat Control Tech Comm Automot Control; IEEE Stand Assoc; IEEE Consumer Elect Soc; IEEE RFID Comm	Vienna, AUSTRIAVienna, AUSTRIA	0	0	0	0	0	0			2378-1289		978-1-4799-6729-2	WOS:000378931500151

Schwartz, M; Harris, H		PROMOTING INTEGRITY INTEGRITIVELY: AVOIDING THE SCYLLA AND CHARYBDIS OF ABDICATION AND ZEALOTRY								ACHIEVING ETHICAL EXCELLENCE		Research in Ethical Issues in Organizations		12				5	27		10.1108/S1529-209620140000012001			2014	2014	There is more than a bit of 'ethical neediness' in society. One good question is what can be done about it. The answer pursued here is that we should promote integrity aggressively and integritively. Directing attention to the arena of higher education and problems associated with academic or educational integrity, the chapter (a) discusses honor codes as a device for promoting academic integrity; (b) identifies and explains a key virtue and a vice of honor codes and, in relation to the values an honor code is meant to safeguard, a significant way in which honor codes are like a professional ethic; and (c) argues that success in this project requires abandonment of an attractive but misleading conception of ethics that suggests, wrongly, that acting rightly is simply a matter of rigid adherence to standards. To be sure, some questions about what one should do are straightforwardly and quite legitimately answered by reference to rules. In this, ethics may seem quite like law (adjudication). But one has to be careful here, lest one be seduced by the siren song of what Roscoe Pound called mechanical jurisprudence, for in law and ethics, as in the Greek myth, this does not have a happy ending. There is more to the story. In ethics (adjudication too) one confronts genuine complexity that cannot be dealt with algorithmically. This is something that we have to face head on, if we are committed to promoting integrity integritively.					20th Annual Australian Association for Professional and Applied Ethics Conference (AAPAE)20th Annual Australian Association for Professional and Applied Ethics Conference (AAPAE)	JUN 27-30, 2013JUN 27-30, 2013		Univ Notre Dame, Fremantle, AUSTRALIAUniv Notre Dame, Fremantle, AUSTRALIA	1	0	0	0	0	1			1529-2096		978-1-78441-246-3; 978-1-78441-245-6	WOS:000362500300002

Having various mechanical properties by modifying the topology of unit cells is a major issue in developing new meso-structures. This paper reviews different design methodologies to design meso-structures. For each method, an algorithm is presented and compared. Computational methods including topology optimization, parametric optimization, and synthesis methods are among the most popular methods for design meso-structures. Ultimately, it is found that there is a gap in systematic design methods for developing new meso-structure architectures as the current methods are limited to parametric sizing and selection. This gap will be addressed in future research.

ASME					AN ENERGY-BASED DESIGN APPROACH FOR A MESO-STRUCTURE WITH HIGH SHEAR FLEXURE								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, 2013, VOL 3A										V03AT03A051				2014	2014	This paper presents a design approach for developing meso-structure for high shear flexure in considering distribution of strain energy for a unit cell. Currently, flexible components are often designed with elastomers to take advantage of their unique properties of low shear modulus and high elongation. However, elastomers exhibit high loss modulus at a high frequency when they are subjected to cyclic loading. As a design requirement to find an alternative material in one of the sub systems in the extraterrestrial rover, materials with high elongation but low energy loss is investigated using a meso-structure design approach. In this paper, an approach to design a meso-structure exhibiting shear flexure is developed by conducting comparative studies of shear flexure on three equivalent configurations: auxetic, honeycomb, and sinusoidal. Based on this comparative study, a new hypothesis is proposed that specific strain energy distribution pattern in these meso-structure has a direct impact on the high shear flexure performance. This proposition is verified by developing a new meso-structure, termed 'S'-Type, which is compared with auxetic and sinusoidal auxetic meso-structures on their shear flexure ability. It is shown from this comparative analysis that the 'S'-Type meso-structure exhibits higher shear flexure than the other two meso-structures at 5, 10, 20, and 40 MPa of effective shear moduli. Hence, based on this result, a four-step design approach is proposed to design future meso-structures with high shear flexure.

This collaboration is facilitated through efficient and effective data and knowledge storage and transfer. Specifically, the data associated with the final assembly of the vehicle should be generated, organized, and distributed in such a manner that each user of the data is able to use it effectively. Furthermore, the structure for the assembly data should be robust and reliable such that it fosters consistency among various planners for multiple vehicle platforms that are assembled all around the world. This research aims to develop a centralized data structure for assembly planning information that will allow a global automotive production company to create, relate, and store the necessary information for the assembly of multiple vehicle platforms in various locations, performed by associates that speak multiple languages. This is achieved by first observing the existing business processes of the company and identifying which processes are crucial to the production of vehicles, which processes may be omitted, and what processes need to be added. A data model is developed around these processes that allows multiple users to interact with the data as applicable to his or her duties, and a user interface is developed to demonstrate these interactions. The prototype system is demonstrated and tested.
