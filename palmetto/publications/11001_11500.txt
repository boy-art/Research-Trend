The optical and physical properties of the plasma jets and preliminary apoptosis data of cultured murine tumor cells and nontumor fibroblast cells treated with these plasma jets are presented. Microplasma jets were observed to induce apoptosis in cultured murine cells in a dose-dependent manner. The murine melanoma tumor cells were more sensitive to plasma treatment than fibroblast cells. These features allow the direct and precise application of this microplasma jet device to tumor cells. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

J	Miller, Shelie A.				Miller, Shelie/B-8177-2015				Minimizing Land Use and Nitrogen Intensity of Bioenergy								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				44	10			3932	3939		10.1021/es902405a			MAY 15 2010	2010	The environmental impacts of bioenergy products have received a great deal of attention. Life cycle analysis (LCA) is a widely accepted method to quantify the environmental impacts of products. Conducting comprehensive LCAs for every possible bioenergy alternative is difficult because of the sheer magnitude of potential biomass sources and energy end products. The scopes of LCAs are often simplified to compare multiple products on the basis of greenhouse gas emissions and net energy balances, and may neglect equally important considerations such as nitrogen and land use. This study determines the most desirable energy crops on the basis of nitrogen and land use. The theoretical minimum nitrogen and land use requirements of fourteen bioenergy feedstocks are evaluated. These results can help prioritize certain feedstock crops for more in-depth life cycle analyses and can be used to inform policies on dedicated energy crops. The results of the study indicate that sugar cane has the best nitrogen and land use profile of the analyzed feedstocks. Sugar cane is the largest contributor to bioenergy production worldwide and is an effective policy choice from a nutrient and land use perspective. Conversely, soybeans and rapeseed are the least effective biomass sources with respect to land use and nitrogen requirements, yet these crops are also used to meet biofuel production targets worldwide. These results indicate current energy policies either do not consider or undervalue nitrogen and land use impacts, which could lead to unsustainable recommendations. Interestingly, when both nitrogen and land intensity are taken into account, reasonably small differences are seen between the remainder of the analyzed feedstocks, indicating an inherent trade-off between energy yield and nitrogen impacts.									35	0	0	17	1	35			0013-936X			WOS:000277499500046	20420363	
J	Sivils, Jeffrey C.; Gonzalez, Iven; Bain, Lisa J.								Mice lacking Mrp1 have reduced testicular steroid hormone levels and alterations in steroid biosynthetic enzymes								GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY				167	1			51	59		10.1016/j.ygcen.2010.02.019			MAY 15 2010	2010	The multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1/ABCC1) is a member of the ABC active transporter family that can transport several steroid hormone conjugates, including 17 beta-estradiol glucuronide, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), and estrone 3-sulfate. The present study investigated the role that MRP1 plays in maintaining proper hormone levels in the serum and testes. Serum and testicular steroid hormone levels were examined in both wild-type mice and Mrp1 null mice. Serum testosterone levels were reduced 5-fold in mice lacking Mrp1, while testicular androstenedione, testosterone, estradiol, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) were significantly reduced by 1.7- to 4.5-fold in Mrp1 knockout mice. Investigating the mechanisms responsible for the reduction in steroid hormones in Mrp1-/- mice revealed no differences in the expression or activity of enzymes that inactivate steroids, the sulfotransferases or glucuronosyltransferases. However, steroid biosynthetic enzyme levels in the testes were altered. Cyp17 protein levels were increased by 1.6-fold, while Cyp17 activity using progesterone as a substrate was also increased by 1.4- to 2.0-fold in mice lacking Mrp1. Additionally, the ratio of 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase to 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and steroidogenic factor 1 to 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase were significantly increased in the testes of Mrp1-/- mice. These results indicate that Mrp1-/- mice have lowered steroid hormones levels, and suggests that upregulation of steroid biosynthetic enzymes may be an attempt to maintain proper steroid hormone homeostasis.

Part 1: In the absence of humidity								JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES				195	10	SI		3060	3068		10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.11.124			MAY 15 2010	2010	The presence of CO in the H-2-rich gas used as fuel for hydrogen fuel cells has a detrimental effect on PEMFC performance and durability at conventional operating conditions. This paper reports on an investigation of the effect of CO on H-2 activation on a fuel cell Pt/C catalyst close to typical PEMFC operating conditions using H-2-D-2 exchange as a probe reaction and to measure hydrogen surface coverage. While normally limited by equilibrium in the absence of impurities on Pt at typical fuel cell operating temperatures, the presence of ppm concentrations of CO increased the apparent activation energy (E-a) of H-2-D-2 exchange reaction (representing H-2 activation) from approximately 4.5-5.3 kcal mole(-1) (Bernasek and Somorjai (1975)[24], Montano et al. (2006) [25]) (in the absence of CO) to 19.3-19.7 kcal mole(-1) (in the presence of 10-70 ppm CO), similar to those reported by Montano et al. (2006) [25]. Calculations based on measurements indicate a CO surface coverage of approximately 0.55 ML at 80 degrees C in H-2 with 70 ppm CO, which coincide very well with surface science results reported by Longwitz et al. (2004) [5]. In addition, surface coverages of hydrogen in the presence of CO suggest a limiting effect on hydrogen spillover by CO. Regeneration of Pt/C at 80 degrees C in H-2 after CO exposure showed only a partial recovery of Pt sites. However, enough CO-free Pt sites existed to easily achieve equilibrium conversion for H-2-D-2 exchange. This paper establishes the baseline and methodology for a series of future studies where the additional effects of Nafion and humidity will be investigated. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

By comparing with conventional dielectric waveguides, we show that the optical force can be enhanced by at least 1 order of magnitude in the hybrid and plasmonic waveguides due to strongly enhanced optical fields at the waveguide surfaces. We compare coupled plasmonic waveguides with different geometries, including rectangular, circular, and triangular cross sections and find that the rectangular waveguides provide the strongest force. We also show that the plasmonic enhancement is nonresonant and thus can be used for a broad range of wavelengths.

PROTEINS-STRUCTURE FUNCTION AND BIOINFORMATICS				78	7			1613	1617		10.1002/prot.22691			MAY 15 2010	2010	The present study addresses the effect of structural distortion, caused by protein modeling errors, on calculated binding affinities toward small molecules. The binding affinities to a total of 300 distorted structures based on five different protein ligand complexes were evaluated to establish a broadly applicable relationship between errors in protein structure and errors in calculated binding affinities. Relatively accurate protein models (less than 2 angstrom RMSD within the binding site) demonstrate a 14.78 (+/- 7.5)% deviation in binding affinity from that calculated by using the corresponding crystal structure. For structures of 2-3 angstrom, 3-4 angstrom, and >4 angstrom RMSD within the binding site, the error in calculated binding affinity increases to 20.8 (+/- 5.98), 22.79 (+/- 11.3), and 29.43 (+/- 11.47)%, respectively. The results described here may be used in combination with other tools to evaluate the utility of modeled protein structures for drug development or other ligand-binding studies.									3	0	0	2	0	3			0887-3585			WOS:000277302300001	20201067

It is found that the addition of yttria and alumina both tend to raise the acoustic velocity when added to silica, with the change due to yttria being much weaker. The temperature-dependence of the Stokes's shift in the YAG-derived fibers is also measured, disclosing a lesser temperature dependence than conventional Ge-doped fibers. These fibers are found experimentally to have a substantially larger acoustic attenuation coefficient relative to that of bulk silica, and assuming a photoelastic constant of amorphous YAG similar to that of pure crystalline YAG, a much-reduced Brillouin gain coefficient as a result. A 40 weight percent yttria and alumina fiber has a Brillouin gain coefficient estimated to be roughly one sixth of pure silica. We also show that the addition of Er to the YAG-derived system decreases the acoustic velocity and broadens the Brillouin spectrum.

The equilibrium aggregate modulus (H(A)), hydraulic permeability (k), and dynamic modulus were examined between five disc regions. Biochemical assays were conducted to quantify the amount of water, collagen, and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content in each region. The creep tests showed that the average equilibrium moduli of the intermediate, lateral, and medial regions were significantly higher than for the anterior and posterior regions (69.75 +/- 11.47 kPa compared to 22.0 +/- 5.15 kPa). Permeability showed the inverse trend with the largest values in the anterior and posterior regions (8.51 +/- 1.36 x 10(-15) m(4)/Ns compared with 3.75 +/- 0.72 x 10(-15) m(4)/Ns). Discs were 74.5% water by wet weight, 62% collagen, and 3.2% GAG by dry weight. Regional variations were only observed for water content which likely results in the regional variation in biphasic mechanical properties. The dynamic modulus of samples during confined compression is related to the aggregate modulus and hydraulic permeability of the tissue. The anterior and posterior regions displayed lower complex moduli over all frequencies (0.01-3 Hz) with average moduli of 171.8-609.3 kPa compared with 454.6-1613.0 kPa for the 3 central regions. The region of the TMJ disc with higher aggregate modulus and lower permeability had higher dynamic modulus. Our results suggested that fluid pressurization plays a significant role in the load support of the TMJ disc under dynamic loading conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

A lack of technical capacity for the formal characterization of these systems, however, is often an impediment to the implementation of effective watershed management practices. Monitoring changes in reservoir storage provides a conceptually simple approach to quantify seepage, but does not account for the losses occurring when seepage is balanced by inflows to the reservoir and the stage remains approximately constant. To overcome this problem we evaluate whether a physically-based volume balance model that explicitly represents watershed processes, including reservoir inflows, can be constrained by a limited set of data readily collected by non-experts, specifically records of reservoir stage, rainfall, and evaporation. To assess the impact of parameter non-uniqueness associated with the calibration of the non-linear model, we perform a Monte Carlo analysis to quantify uncertainty in the total volume of water contributed to the subsurface by the 2007 monsoon for a dam located in the Deccan basalts near the village of Salri in Madhya Pradesh, India. The Monte Carlo analysis demonstrated that subsurface losses from the reservoir could be constrained with the available data, but additional measurements are required to constrain reservoir inflows. Our estimate of seepage from the reservoir (7.0 +/- 0.6 x 10(4) m(3)) is 3.5 times greater than the recharge volume estimated by considering reservoir volume changes alone. This result suggests that artificial recharge could be significantly underestimated when reservoir inflows are not explicitly included in models. Our seepage estimate also accounts for about 11% of rainfall occurring upstream of the dam and is comparable in magnitude to natural ground water recharge, thereby indicating that the reservoir plays a significant role in the hydrology of this small watershed.

The scheme builds on an optimal strategy for reducing the epidemic's initial growth rate in a stratified mass-action model. The strategy is tested on the EpiSims network describing interactions and influenza dynamics in the population of Utah, where the stratification we have chosen is by age (0 , 7 3, 14 8, adults). No prior immunity information is available, thus everyone is assumed to be susceptible-this may be relevant, possibly with the exception of persons over 50, to the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak. We have found that the top priority in an allocation of a sizeable quantity of seasonal influenza vaccinations goes to young children (0-6), followed by teens (14-18), then children (7-13), with the adult share being quite low. These results, which rely on the structure of the EpiSims network, are compared with the current influenza vaccination coverage levels in the US population.									23	0	0	16	0	23			1742-5689	1742-5662		WOS:000275927900004	19828505

However, conjugates involving fullerenes or other nanomaterials often differ significantly from the free drug molecules in cellular uptake and distributions. For the highly effective anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX), its strong absorption and fluorescence in the visible spectral region enable the tracking of DOX-containing conjugates by optical techniques. In this work, a stoimetrically and structurally well-defined fullerene-DOX conjugate was studied in terms of fluorescence microscopy, including the fluorescence imaging with two-photon excitation, to examine the uptake and distribution in human breast cancer cells. The results suggested that the conjugate was distributed mostly in the cytoplasm, significantly different from free DOX molecules (predominantly in the cell nucleus, as already reported in the literature). Mechanistic implications of the results are discussed. Also discussed are potentials of conjugated DOX species as self-labeled fluorescent probes in bioimaging and other mechanistic investigations on drug delivery.									33	1	0	11	0	34			1944-8244			WOS:000277977400018	20420365

Most genes with up-regulated expression were related to immune function, with the remaining genes involved in ligand binding, signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, and formation and transportation of proteins including enzymes. Of notable involvement were genes encoding for major histocompatibility complexes, small inducible cytokine A5 precursor, myxovirus-resistant proteins, and components of the classical complement pathway, which are all genes common to pathways of viral infections and autoimmunity.Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Although results of microarray analysis did not clearly define a potential etiology of Greyhound meningoencephalitis, they did highlight a consistent gene alteration signature that would suggest a common etiology and pathogenesis for this condition.

For the examined indentation depth h of <= 200 nm, the measured Young's modulus E decreases with increasing h. Furthermore, the rate of reduction in the apparent E, in general, decreases with increasing z. The dependence of apparent E on h is attributed to indentation-induced inelastic deformation, particularly the deformation related to the high local stresses beneath the indenter tip, such as kink band formation, layer delamination, void generation, and cracking, which tend to cause damage to the layer structure. To minimize the influence of inelastic deformation on the measurement of E by indentation, the maximum E at small h is proposed to be the truly representative elastic modulus. The stiffest species, margarite, with z = 1.823, has a representative E of 165.5 GPa, seven times greater than that of pyrophyllite with z = 0 and E = 23.5 GPa. A nearly linear correlation between the representative E and the square of the ratio of the surface charge density sigma to half of the basal spacing d(001), [2 sigma/d(001)](2), exists. This relationship suggests that the elasticity normal to the basal plane of these phyllosilicates is primarily controlled by the long-range electrostatic attractions between the 2:1 layer and interlayer cations instead of atomic bonds within the 2:1 layer, although other compositional and structural variations also affect the interlayer interactions. This relationship may indicate that the interlayer complexes can be used as the elasticity signatures of phyllosilicate minerals.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0003-004X			WOS:000277654100022

A symmetrized moment estimator is proposed that exploits the reversible structure. Examples are given where the symmetrized estimator has superior asymptotic properties to those of a naive estimator, implying that knowledge of reversibility can sometimes improve estimation. The asymptotic mean and variance of the estimators are quantified. The results are proven using only elementary results such as the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0003-1305			WOS:000278250500003

Surface functionalization with polyacrylic acid (PAA) was achieved using a "grafting to" approach, yielding a stable sorbent that has the potential of being employed over a large range of pH values and a variety of sample matrices. PAA was chosen for surface modification because the repeating acrylic acid monomeric unit, which contains a carboxylic acid, has the ability to bind metal ions. In a micropipette-tip SPE format, these PAA-functionalized C-CP fibers showed the ability to efficiently bind several metals (Cu(2+), Cu(+), Ni(2+), Fe(3+), UO(2)(2+)), while elution could be achieved with extremely low concentrations of hydrochloric acid (1 ml of 0.005%), resulting in overall recoveries of greater than 88%. A single tip was carried throughout the entire study as a control, and showed overall recoveries averaging 96% over the course of 19 extraction experiments and a 12-month period, demonstrating the chemical stability of the sorbent material, and suggesting the potential of the C-CP fiber SPE tips to be used multiple times.									13	0	0	5	0	13			1759-9660			WOS:000279004900007

This study analyzed large-scale data covering multiple years of cohorts of delinquent youths born between 1981 and 1988. Truancy offenders tend to be referred to the juvenile justice system at an earlier age, be juveniles with a family criminal history, and have received special education services. Caucasians girls, juveniles from lower income families, and juveniles who did not use drugs were more likely to be referred for truancy offenses than for other offenses. Implications of these findings for practice and future research are addressed.									6	0	0	0	3	9			0198-7429			WOS:000284921600004		
J	Xi, Hongjuan; Kumar, Sunil; Dosen-Micovic, Ljiljana; Arya, Dev P.								Calorimetric and spectroscopic studies of aminoglycoside binding to AT-rich DNA triple helices								BIOCHIMIE				92	5			514	529		10.1016/j.biochi.2010.02.004			MAY 2010	2010	Calorimetric and fluorescence techniques were used to characterize the binding of aminoglycosides-neomycin, paromomycin, and ribostamycin, with 5'-dA(12)-x-dT(12)-x-dT(12)-3' intramolecular DNA triplex (x = hexaethylene glycol) and poly(dA) center dot 2poly(dT) triplex. Our results demonstrate the following features: (1) UV thermal analysis reveals that the T(m) for triplex decreases with increasing pH value in the presence of neomycin, while the Tm for the duplex remains unchanged. (2) The binding affinity of neomycin decreases with increased pH, although there is an increase in observed binding enthalpy. (3) ITC studies conducted in two buffers (sodium cacodylate and MOPS) yield the number of protonated drug amino groups (Delta n) as 0.29 and 0.40 for neomycin and paromomycin interaction with 5'-dA(12)-x-dT(12)-x-dT(12)-3', respectively. (4) The specific heat capacity change (Delta Cp) determined by ITC studies is negative, with more negative values at lower salt concentrations. From 100 mM to 250 mM KCl, the Delta C(p) ranges from 402 to 60 cal/(mol K) for neomycin. At pH 5.5, a more positive Delta C(p) is observed, with a value of 98 cal/(mol K) at 100 mM KCl. Delta C(p) is not significantly affected by ionic strength. (5) Salt dependence studies reveal that there are at least three amino groups of neomycin participating in the electrostatic interactions with the triplex. (6) FID studies using thiazole orange were used to derive the AC(50) (aminoglycoside concentration needed to displace 50% of the dye from the triplex) values. Neomycin shows a seven fold higher affinity than paromomycin and eleven fold higher affinity than ribostamycin at pH 6.8. (7) Modeling studies, consistent with UV and ITC results, show the importance of an additional positive charge in triplex recognition by neomycin. The modeling and thermodynamic studies indicate that neomycin binding to the DNA triplex depends upon significant contributions from charge as well as shape complementarity of the drug to the DNA triplex Watson-Hoogsteen groove.

(Hans)								Sequential saccharification of corn fiber and ethanol production by the brown rot fungus Gloeophyllum trabeum								BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY				101	10			3526	3533		10.1016/j.biortech.2009.12.115			MAY 2010	2010	Degradation of lignocellulosic biomass to sugars through a purely biological process is a key to sustainable biofuel production. Hydrolysis of the corn wet-milling co-product-corn fiber-to simple sugars by the brown rot fungus Gloeophyllum trabeum was studied in suspended-culture and solid-state fermentations. Suspended-culture experiments were not effective in producing harvestable sugars from the corn fiber. The fungus consumed sugars released by fungal extracellular enzymes. Solid-state fermentation demonstrated up to 40% fiber degradation within 9 days. Enzyme activity assays on solid-state fermentation filtrates confirmed the involvement of starch- and cellulose-degrading enzymes. To reduce fungal consumption of sugars and to accelerate enzyme activity, 2- and 3-d solid-state fermentation biomasses (fiber and fungus) were submerged in buffer and incubated at 37 degrees C without shaking. This anaerobic incubation converted up to almost 11% of the corn fiber into harvestable reducing sugars. Sugars released by G. trabeum were fermented to a maximum yield of 3.3 g ethanol/100 g fiber. This is the first report, to our knowledge, of G, trabeum fermenting sugar to ethanol. The addition of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a coculture led to more rapid fermentation to a maximum yield of 4.0 g ethanol/100 g fiber. The findings demonstrate the potential for this simple fungal process, requiring no pretreatment of the corn fiber, to produce more ethanol by hydrolyzing and fermenting carbohydrates in this lignocellulosic co-product.

Previous studies correlating liana abundance with these climatic variables have produced conflicting results, warranting a new analysis of drivers of liana abundance based on a different dataset. We compiled a pan-tropical dataset containing 28,953 lianas (>= 2.5 cm diam.) from studies conducted at 13 Neotropical and 11 Paleotropical dry to wet lowland tropical forests. The ranges in MAP and dry season length (DSL) (number of months with mean rainfall < 100 mm) represented by these datasets were 860-7250 mm/yr and 0-7 mo, respectively. Pan-tropically, liana density and basal area decreased significantly with increasing annual rainfall and increased with increasing DSL, supporting the hypotheses of Gentry and Schnitzer. Our results suggest that much of the variation in liana density and basal area in the tropics can be accounted for by the relatively simple metrics of MAP and DSL.									62	2	0	56	3	66			0006-3606			WOS:000277289400006

Analysis of rheological properties of rubberized binders containing warm asphalt additives								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING				37	5			763	771		10.1139/L10-020			MAY 2010	2010	The main objective of using warm mix asphalt (WMA) is to reduce emissions and improve the workability by lowering the mixing and compaction temperatures of asphalt mixes through different mechanisms. Since warm asphalt is a relatively new technology, not much research has been conducted on various mix compositions. While some of the concerns about WMA have been addressed, the interaction of warm mix additives with modified binders, especially crumb rubber modified (CRM) binder, is not known in great detail. This paper presents the data on rheological tests conducted on rubberized binders containing warm asphalt additives. Binders from live different sources were modified using 10% crumb rubber by weight of the virgin binders. Two of the available warm asphalt technologies. Aspha-min (R) and Sasobit (R), were used to produce the warm asphalt binders. From the tests, it was observed that the addition of the warm asphalt additives significantly reduce the permanent deformation of the binders, increase the viscosity at 60 degrees C and the complex modulus, G*, and decrease the phase angle, delta, at high frequencies and low temperatures compared with the CRM binders.									9	0	0	0	1	9			0315-1468			WOS:000279243100009

First, the paper developed an improved algorithm to perform light scattering calculations by coated spheres. The improved algorithm was implemented in FORTRAN90 as a subroutine to allow flexible application of the code. Second, the new program was applied to the characterization of composite aluminum nanoparticles. In this application, multiple elements of the Mueller scattering matrix were measured at multiple angles to infer the properties of the nanoparticles, including the size distribution function and the thickness of the coating. The new program played a key role in the fitting of the measured data, and this application demonstrated the advantages of the new program in situations that demand high efficiency and reliability.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0010-4655			WOS:000276430000018

Interaction effects of crumb rubber modified asphalt binders								CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS				24	5			824	831		10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2009.10.024			MAY 2010	2010	The application of crumb rubber in asphalt mixtures is intended to improve the binder properties by reducing the binder's inherent temperature susceptibility. This research investigated the interaction effects of CRM binders as a function of various blending treatments in the laboratory. For this study. CRM binders were produced using seven blending times (5, 30, 60, 90, 120, 240, and 480 min), three blending temperatures (177, 200, and 223 degrees C), and four rubber contents (5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% by weight of asphalt binder). The results from this study showed that (1) The interaction time and interaction temperature for CRM binders were observed to have significant effect on the binder properties; (2) The longer time and higher temperature for interaction of CRM binders resulted in an increase in the high failure temperature and the viscosity. This is thought to be due to the increase in the rubber mass through binder absorption. However, this study found that the control binder of PG 64-22 had little change of the binder properties as a function of interaction conditions; (3) The CRM percentage influence is statistically significant on the viscosity and G(*)/sin delta values. Also, the asphalt binder with higher CRM percentage showed a higher large molecular size (LMS) value, and the increase in CRM percentage is considered to result in the additional loss of the low molecular weight in the asphalt binder to the CRM.

Effects of Sod Type, Irrigation, and Fertilization on Nitrate-Nitrogen and Orthophosphate-Phosphorus Leaching from Newly Established St. Augustinegrass Sod								CROP SCIENCE				50	3			1030	1036		10.2135/cropsci2009.07.0411			MAY-JUN 2010	2010	Nitrogen and P leaching losses from fertilized turfgrass remain an environmental concern. In the present study, we examined the effects of sod type, fertilization, and irrigation on turf quality, NO(3)-N and PO(4)-P leaching following St. Augustinegrass [Stenotaphrum secundaturn (Walt.) Kuntze] sod installation. Treatments included muck- vs. sand-produced sod, no fertilization, fertilization with 4.9 g N m(-2) at installation or at 30 d after installation (DAI), and routine irrigation or irrigation at stress from 30 to 60 DAI. Drainage was collected from lysimeters installed in each plot and analyzed for NO(3)-N and PO(4)-P to determine total leaching losses. Across all treatments, drainage averaged 290, 902, and 604 mm during each of the three trials. Fertilization at 30 DAI significantly reduced PO(4)-P leaching losses compared to fertilization at 0 DAI. Muck sod type significantly reduced the quantity of NO(3)-N leached. Muck sod also significantly reduced PO(4)-P leached and resulted in better turf quality in two of the three trials. In the context of minimizing nutrient leaching, these results support the use of muck-grown sod established during low rainfall periods with fertilization delayed at least 30 DAI and with judicious use of irrigation.									8	0	0	7	0	8			0011-183X			WOS:000276961900032

Bulk transport growth of ThO2 was performed to determine the viability of large-scale production of ThO2 single crystals for possible nuclear fuel applications. The thermal conductivity and thermal expansion properties of single crystal ThO2 were measured and are reported here for the first time. The single crystal sample, in regard to nuclear fuel applications, showed improved thermal performance compared with previously reported polycrystalline values.									19	1	0	1	0	19			1528-7483			WOS:000277273900025

The chromatic index of a G-decomposition of H is the minimum number of colors required to color the parts of the decomposition so that parts which share a common node get different colors. We establish an upper bound on the chromatic index and characterize those decompositions which achieve it. The structurally most interesting of the decompositions with maximal chromatic index are associated with (v, k, 1)-designs.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0911-0119			WOS:000277468800006

This paper describes a significant improvement to existing circuit-oriented FEMs that reduces the number of circuit elements and eliminates low-frequency stability problems. A modified LU recombination method is used to reformulate the original field-solver matrix equations. Circuits based on the reformulated equations are relatively insensitive to numerical errors and do not contain the small-value series resistors that circuit solvers are normally forced to add in order to guarantee a stable solution. Using this approach, the circuit-oriented FEM is capable of time-and/or frequency-domain simulations of problems containing linear or nonlinear lumped elements over a wide bandwidth. Examples are provided that demonstrate the ability of the new technique to model geometries from dc to several gigahertz in a single simulation.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0018-9480			WOS:000277660200013

A high-throughput 96-well plate method was created to test large numbers of replicated sample biomass hydrolysis rates using Trichoderma viride cellulase. Analysis of the entire panel showed a wide range of hydrolysis rates, ranging from 0.6 mu g/h/U cellulase to 2.7 mu g/h/U cellulase, with an average rate of release of 1.5 mu g/h/U cellulase. The detected hydrolysis rate is the hydrolysis yield potential (HYP) for each sorghum variety. Additionally, pretreatment with ammonium hydroxide increased the rate of hydrolysis by an average of 1.9 fold, yet did not correlate with non-pretreated hydrolysis yield potential. This study identifies specific sorghum varieties with high HYP and sets the stage for the genetic mapping of HYP genes. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A rigid-body model of a prototypical adjustable car seat is constructed as a part of the present work and combined with a public-domain musculoskeletal model of a seated human. Seated-human/car-seat interactions associated with typical seating postures of the vehicle driver are analyzed using the inverse-dynamics approach while the "minimum-fatigue" criterion is utilized to deal with the muscle redundancy problem (i.e., with the problem that human-body contains more muscles than what would be typically needed to drive various body joints).The results obtained show that various seat adjustments (e.g., back-rest inclination, seat-pan horizontal track position, etc.), driver's back supports (e.g., presence/absence of lumbar support) and the nature of seat upholstery (e.g., fabric vs. vinyl) can have complex influence on the muscle activation, joint forces, soft-tissue contact normal and shear stresses, all of which not only affect the comfort perception of the driver but also their feel of fatigue. Subsequently, the results of the present work along with relevant public-domain literature findings (e.g., subjective driving-fatigue assessments provided by human test subjects and human-body/seat contact-force measurements) are used to construct a preliminary long-distance driving-fatigue function.Relevance to industry: it is argued that the computer-aided engineering analysis introduced in the present work should help speed-up the design of new high-comfort car seats. These seats are currently being mainly designed using empiricism, legacy knowledge and extensive, time-consuming and costly prototyping and experimental/field testing. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Evidence from Texas								JOURNAL OF ACCOUNTING AND PUBLIC POLICY				29	3			242	258		10.1016/j.jaccpubpol.2009.10.010			MAY-JUN 2010	2010	Policymakers often question whether not-for-profit (NFP) hospitals provide enough charity care to justify tax advantages. In 1993, Texas enacted legislation requiring NFP hospitals to provide certain community benefits at levels set forth in specific criteria to retain tax-exempt status; this paper focuses on the effect of the legislation's requirement that NFP hospitals spend a minimum of 4% of net patient revenue on charity care. We also study a modification of the law passed in 1995, which allows the deduction of bad debts expense when calculating net patient revenue. This change effectively lowers required charity care spending, and our study considers whether Texas hospitals responded by reducing charity care spending.We test the Texas laws' effect on hospital charity care spending using financial data for 1992 through 1997. As anticipated, results show that, on average, NFP hospitals spending below the 4% threshold increased their charity care spending to meet this threshold. Surprisingly, NFP hospitals spending above the threshold experienced a marginally significant decrease in spending. After the 1995 law change, hospitals with higher total margins decreased charity care spending, an unintended consequence of the legislation.Overall, the Texas law changes did not, on average, lead to increased charity care spending by NFP hospitals. While spending increased by NFPs providing too little charity care prior to the law, this group represents less than 20% of our sample. These findings are particularly important given the increase in Texas uninsurance rates during the sample period. Seventeen states have followed Texas lead by enacting legislation regarding the charity care spending by NFPs, thus an empirical investigation into the impact of this precedent-setting legislation is critical for evaluating the effectiveness of specific charity care requirements.

Increasingly, ecologists conceptualize local communities as connected to a regional species pool rather than as isolated entities. By this paradigm, community structure is determined through the relative strengths of dispersal-driven regional effects and local environmental factors. However, despite explicit incorporation of dispersal, metacommunity models and frameworks often fail to capture the realities of natural systems by not accounting for the configuration of space within which organisms disperse. This shortcoming may be of particular consequence in riverine networks which consist of linearly -arranged, hierarchical, branching habitat elements. Our goal was to understand how constraints of network connectivity in riverine systems change the relative importance of local vs. regional factors in structuring communities.2. We hypothesized that communities in more isolated headwaters of riverine networks would be structured by local forces, while mainstem sections would be structured by both local and regional processes. We examined these hypotheses using a spatially explicit regional analysis of riverine macroinvertebrate communities, focusing on change in community similarity with distance between local communities [i.e., distance-decay relationships; (DDRs)], and the change in environmental similarity with distance. Strong DDRs frequently indicate dispersal-driven dynamics.3. There was no evidence of a DDR in headwater communities, supporting our hypothesis that dispersal is a weak structuring force. Furthermore, a positive relationship between community similarity and environmental similarity supported dynamics driven by local environmental factors (i.e., species sorting). In mainstem habitats, significant DDRs and community x environment similarity relationships suggested both dispersal-driven and environmental constraints on local community structure (i.e., mass effects).4. We used species traits to compare communities characterized by low vs. high dispersal taxa. In headwaters, neither strength nor mode (in-network vs. out of network) of dispersal changed our results. However, outcomes in mainstems changed substantially with both dispersal mode and strength, further supporting the hypothesis that regional forces drive community dynamics in mainstems.5. Our findings demonstrate that the balance of local and regional effects changes depending on location within riverine network with local (environmental) factors dictating community structure in headwaters, and regional (dispersal driven) forces dominating in mainstems.									130	0	0	129	1	133			0021-8790			WOS:000275886400009	20180874

This preliminary research leads to follow-up questions such as which attributes are most influential? And how can the influence of these attributes be quantified? Answering questions like these is impractical using only traditional construction research methods. Delivery process attributes can have greater impact on one sustainable project and less on another, and controlling the numerous variables involved is nearly impossible. To answer questions facing similar constraints, economist Robert Fogel pioneered the counterfactual analysis research method, winning a Nobel Prize in the process. The objective of this article is to describe the adaptation and testing of counterfactual analysis to assist study of sustainable project delivery processes. Counterfactual analysis is especially well suited for sustainable projects, with their complex processes and stakeholder interactions. The adapted six-step method is informed by applications of counterfactual analysis in fields including economics, history, and political science. Descriptions of each step include specific examples from a pilot study of the method. A path forward is outlined for applying counterfactual analysis to examine key questions related to sustainable construction projects and to more broad areas of construction research.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0733-9364			WOS:000276693000012

We find that the impact of our school quality measures diminishes by factors of 2 to 4 after accounting for the fact that families may choose where to live in part based on school characteristics and labor market opportunities. The positive statistical relationship between child outcomes and maternal employment reverses sign and remains statistically significant after controlling for its possible endogeneity. Our estimates imply that when parental responses are taken into account, policy changes in school quality end up having only minor impacts on child test scores.

Upward movement of plutonium to surface sediments during an 11-year field study								JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY				101	5			338	344		10.1016/j.jenvrad.2010.01.007			MAY 2010	2010	An 11-year lysimeter study was established to monitor the movement of Pu through vadose zone sediments. Sediment Pu concentrations as a function of depth indicated that some Pu moved upward from the buried source material. Subsequent numerical modeling suggested that the upward movement was largely the result of invading grasses taking up the Pu and translocating it upward. The objective of this study was to determine if the Pu of surface sediments originated from atmosphere fallout or from the buried lysimeter source material (weapons-grade Pu), providing additional evidence that plants were involved in the upward migration of Pu. The (240)Pu/(239)Pu and (242)Pu/(239)Pu atomic fraction ratios of the lysimeter surface sediments, as determined by Thermal Ionization Mass Spectroscopy (TIMS), were 0.063 and 0.00045, respectively; consistent with the signatures of the weapons-grade Pu. Our numerical simulations indicate that because plants create a large water flux, small concentrations over multiple years may result in a measurable accumulation of Pu on the ground surface. These results may have implications on the conceptual model for calculating risk associated with long-term stewardship and monitored natural attenuation management of Pu contaminated subsurface and surface sediments.

The purpose of this study was to utilize a sheep model to determine the effects of circular and linear exercise on biochemical markers in serum and synovial fluid (SF). Twenty lambs (5 months) were assigned to three groups: circular exercise (C, 8.5 m diameter; n = 8), straight-line exercise (S, treadmill; n = 8) and nonexercised control (CON, n = 4). Lambs (C and S) were exercised up to 8 weeks at 1.3 m/s for up to 30 minutes, 6 days per week. Serum and SF from a metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint was collected. Serum total protein (P = .66), Collagen Type II cleavage [3/4] fragments concentrations (P = .44) and lysyl oxidase (LOX) (P = .15) activity were not different among treatment groups throughout the study. There was a polynomial response to serum LOX over time (R(2) = 0.7464). There were no differences in SF total protein (P = .94, right MCP; P = .68, left MCP) or SF LOX specific activities (P = .9, right MCP; P = .93, left MCP) among groups throughout the study. However, SF LOX specific activity did increase over time (P = .001) for all treatment groups. These results indicated that the biochemical markers utilized in this study were unable to detect differences between groups with respect to exercise protocols. However, the LOX activity did increase over time possibly as a result of growth.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0737-0806			WOS:000278577400009

This type of outlet structure is common in detention ponds to achieve runoff volume control from developed areas in order to meet outflow discharge and water quality requirements. The discharge coefficient is determined by recording the drop in pond water level with time as water flows out of the orifice. The discharge coefficient is found to be a function of head over the orifice, location of the orifice above the floor of the tank, and the ratio of the orifice diameter to riser pipe diameter. The discharge coefficient increases as the head over the orifice decreases and height of the orifice above the floor of the tank decreases. The discharge coefficient reduces as the ratio of the orifice diameter to pipe diameter increases and eventually reaches an asymptotic value. Also, with all other variables being the same, the discharge coefficient is lower for larger size riser pipe. An equation that is a function of head over the orifice and height of the orifice above the floor of the tank is fitted for each ratio of orifice diameter to piper diameter. The coefficients of the equation are found to be a function of the ratio of orifice diameter to piper diameter. A minimum coefficient of determination of 0.78 for the fitted equation suggests that the fit can be used to determine the discharge coefficient for orifices in circular riser pipes.									13	0	0	0	0	13			0733-9437	1943-4774		WOS:000276691600007

Samples were produced by solution combustion synthesis using three different organic fuels to check for the effect of synthesis conditions on the properties of interest. Luminescence characteristics were studied by thermoluminescence and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) techniques. We found that samples produced using urea have characteristics similar to bulk Al(2)O(3):C and may be suitable for personal dosimetry, while samples produced using glycine and hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) may be more suitable for applications where fast OSL decay is advantageous. While these results are promising and warrant further investigation, much has to be done to overcome the greatly decreased luminescence intensity of the nanomaterials as compared to bulk Al(2)O(3):C.

The comparison problem largely remains open for completely nonparametric models with multi-dimensional covariates. We address this issue under the assumption that models are single-index models (SIMs). We propose a test for checking the equality of the mean functions of two (or more) SIM's. The asymptotic normality of the test statistic is established and an empirical study is conducted to evaluate the finite-sample performance of the proposed procedure. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

A quadratic polynomial model was obtained to predict the methyl ester yield. 98 wt% of the methyl ester yield could be reached at the deduced optimal conditions: methanol/oil molar raito of 6.2:1, NaOH catalyst concentration of 1 wt% (by the weight of crude cottonseed oil) and reaction time of 8 min. Validation experiments confirmed the validity of the predicted model. Moreover, ultrasonic irradiation was proved to be an efficient, energy saving and economically feasible way to produce biodiesel.									10	0	0	3	0	10			1345-8957	1347-3352		WOS:000277054200002	20431239

Monomers were confirmed from ATR-FTIR, (1)H, (13)C, and (19)F NMR, and HRMS analysis. Aryl BTFVE compounds were thermally polymerized to afford perfluorocyclobutyl (PFCB) aryl ether polymers with high number average molecular weight (M(n)) for homopolymers (17,050-27,090) and copolymers with 4,4'-bis(trifluorovinyloxy)biphenyl monomers (27,860-56,500). The PFCB aryl ether homo- and copolymers collectively possess high thermal stability (>299 degrees C in N(2)) and are readily solution processable producing optically transparent films. The thermal polymerization was achieved and reactive moieties remained intact, aside from those functionalized with acrylates. In the case with acrylate functionalized polymers, orthogonal polymerization was achieved by first photopolymerizing the acrylates followed by thermal curing of the aryl trifluorovinyl ether endgroups. Preliminary results in this study produced the successful preparation of photodefinable PFCB aryl ether material. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This study investigated the influence of clinical dental treatments and procedures, such as whitening treatments or etching prior to restorative procedures. Both autoclaved and non-autoclaved teeth were studied in order to allow for both comparison with published values and improved clinical relevance. Nanoindentation analysis with the Oliver-Pharr model provided elastic modulus and hardness across the dentin-enamel junction (DEJ). Large increases were observed in the elastic modulus of enamel in teeth that had been autoclaved (52.0 GPa versus 113.4 GPa), while smaller increases were observed in the dentin (17.9 GPa versus 27.9 GPa). Likewise, there was an increase in the hardness of enamel (2.0 GPa versus 4.3 GPa) and dentin (0.5 GPa versus 0.7 GPa) with autoclaving. These changes suggested that the range of elastic modulus and hardness values previously reported in the literature may be partially due to the sterilization procedures. Treatment of the exterior of non-autoclaved teeth with Crest Whitestrips (TM), Opalescence (TM) or UltraEtch (TM) caused changes in the mechanical properties of both the enamel and dentin. Those treated with Crest Whitestrips (TM) showed a reduction in the elastic modulus of enamel (55.3 GPa to 32.7 GPa) and increase in the elastic modulus of dentin (17.2 GPa to 24.3 GPa). Opalescence (TM) treatments did not significantly affect the enamel properties, but did result in a decrease in the modulus of dentin (18.5 GPa to 15.1 GPa). Additionally, as expected, UltraEtch (TM) treatment decreased the modulus and hardness of enamel (48.7 GPa to 38.0 GPa and 1.9 GPa to 1.5 GPa, respectively) and dentin (21.4 GPa to 15.0 GPa and 1.9 GPa to 1.5 GPa, respectively). Changes in the mechanical properties were linked to altered protein concentration within the tooth, as evidenced by fluorescence microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.

Journal of Threatened Taxa				2	5			876	888					May 2010	2010	We conducted a bird survey in the Sabaragamuwa University premises in southeastern Sri Lanka between 2001 and 2004. We recorded 145 bird species, representing 17 orders and 51 families from the campus. The birdlife included Red-faced Malkoha, a globally Vulnerable species and four Near Threatened taxa. The university premises suffer from severe habitat alteration largely owing to fire, filling-up of aquatic habitats, resource over-extraction, improper waste management, invasion by exotic species and livestock grazing. Several conservation measures, including habitat management strategies such as restoration of riparian vegetation, and wetlands, increasing plant diversity in home gardens and prevention of secondary successions in grasslands are recommended to protect the campus environment and to conserve its avifaunal diversity.									0	0	0	2	0	2			0974-7893; 0974-7907			ZOOREC:ZOOR14610071806

J	He, Wenjun; Huda, Walter; Magill, Dennise; Tavrides, Emily; Yao, Hai								Patient doses and projection angle in cone beam CT								MEDICAL PHYSICS				37	5			2359	2368		10.1118/1.3397458			MAY 2010	2010	Purpose: To investigate how x-ray tube projection angle affects organ and effective doses to patients undergoing a CT examination on a cone beam scanner.Methods: The authors investigated two cone beam CT systems that use a flat panel detector to capture the x-ray pattern transmitted through patients. One system had the flat panel detector and x-ray tube mounted on a conventional CT gantry (gantry CT), whereas the other CT scanner had the x-ray tube and flat panel detector mounted on a C-arm apparatus (C-arm CT). PCXMC software package (version 2.0.1) was used to compute absorbed doses at a constant x-ray beam output as a function of the x-ray tube projection angle. This software uses a mathematical hermaphroditic phantom with a weight of 73.2 kg and a height of 178.6 cm. Average absorbed doses were generated and recorded for five radiosensitive organs (i.e., breast, colon, lung, red bone marrow, and stomach), as well as the corresponding effective dose. Doses for both CT gantries were obtained every 15 degrees of the x-ray tube projection angle, at each of six locations in 10 cm increments along the patient long axis. The authors also investigated the effect on patient dose of filtrations ranging from 2.5 to 9.5 mm Al, with x-ray tube voltages ranging from 80 to 140 kV.Results: There were substantial differences in organ doses as a function of the projection angle, with higher organ doses for anteroposterior projection and lower doses for lateral projections. The maximum to minimum ratios of organ dose as a function of the x-ray tube angle were similar to 2.2 for the lungs, similar to 3.7 for the colon, similar to 5.9 for the red bone marrow, similar to 19.8 for the breast, and similar to 36 for the stomach. At the same x-ray tube voltage (kV) and intensity (mA s), the ratio of dose maxima for the two cone beam CT geometries for the five organs investigated was 1.85 +/- 0.10, which is mainly attributed to differences in source to isocenter distances. Effective doses varied with x-ray tube angle by a factor of similar to 2.7 for chest CT examinations and by a factor of similar to 4.0 for abdomen/pelvis examinations. Changes in the x-ray tube voltage and beam filtration showed the expected changes in absolute organ doses, but had little effect on relative doses.Conclusions: There are major differences in organ and effective dose as the x-ray tube rotates around the patient. The results suggest that the use of x-ray tube current modulation could produce substantial reductions in organ and effective dose for body imaging with cone beam CT.									3	1	0	2	0	4			0094-2405			WOS:000277242800044	20527570

Based on the MD results and prior experimental data, we show that counterion packing in planar EDLs does not reach the steric limit at electrode voltages below 1 V. In addition, we demonstrate that a PNP model, when complemented with a Stern model, can be effectively used to capture the overall charging kinetics. However, the PNP/Stern model can only give a qualitative description of the fine features of the EDL.									11	1	0	0	0	11			1613-4982			WOS:000276474300014

Comparing resident and tourist preferences for public beach access and related amenities								OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT				53	5-6			245	251		10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2010.04.007			MAY-JUN 2010	2010	As coastal destinations continue to grow, due to tourism and residential expansion, the demand for public beach access and related amenities will also increase. The issue confronting management agencies responsible for providing and maintaining public beach access and related amenities is the varying needs and preferences of both residents and tourists of coastal destinations. The purpose of this paper is to provide comprehensive information about coastal recreational needs of residents and tourists with regards to public beach access and associated amenities using the stated preference choice method. Overall, the results indicate tourists were more interested in additional public beach access points and commercial development, while residents supported beach rules and regulations but opposed high levels of crowding and noise. Implications of these results for management agencies include the utilization of parking fees to subsidize additional public beach access points, identifying appropriate types and levels of commercial development that moderate the use of coastal resources by tourists and day-trip users, and implementing beach rules and regulations that reduce the potential for conflict between user groups. Providing management agencies with comprehensive information of the preferences of different beach user groups can assist in the development of more effective policies and management programs.

Batsch] as potential candidates for control of the non-dormant phenotype observed in the evg mutant. Of these genes, DAM3, DAM5 and DAM6 were winter expressed, suggesting a role for these genes during endodormancy. We used peach cultivars with contrasting chilling requirements (CR) for bud break to observe the expression of DAM3, DAM5 and DAM6 in response to chilling accumulation in the field and controlled environments. Vegetative terminal and floral buds were sampled weekly from field grown 'Contender' (1050 h CR), 'Rubyprince' (850 h CR) and 'Springprince' (650 h CR) peach cultivars through winter 2008-2009. Flower and vegetative terminal bud break potential was evaluated at each sampling by forcing cuttings in a growth-permissive environment. We also measured vegetative terminal bud break and DAM gene expression in potted 'Contender' and 'Peen-To' (450 h CR) trees under controlled-environment cold exposure. DAM3, DAM5 and DAM6 are all suppressed by exposure to chilling temperatures in the field and in controlled conditions. Expression of DAM5 and DAM6 are higher in high chill cultivars prior to chilling accumulation and their expression level reaches a minimum in each cultivar coincident with acquisition of bud break competence. Expression levels of DAM5 and DAM6 in vegetative tips in controlled environment conditions were negatively correlated with the time required for bud break in forcing conditions. The expression patterns of DAM5 and DAM6 are consistent with a role as quantitative repressors of bud break.									52	5	0	53	0	59			0167-4412			WOS:000276440900014	20143130

Ninety hatching eggs obtained from a 30-wk-old broiler breeder flock were incubated on 3 replicate tray levels (30 eggs per tray) for 19 d. On 15 and 19 d of incubation, 10 live embryos per tray level were necropsied to collect pipping muscle and liver samples. As the broiler embryo developed between d 15 and 19 of incubation, the glycogen and protein concentrations of the pipping muscle increased, whereas those of the liver decreased, and the fat concentration of the pipping muscle decreased, whereas that of the liver increased. Across d 15 and 19, pipping muscle glycogen was negatively correlated with liver fat, whereas on d 15, pipping muscle glucose was negatively correlated with liver fat, and pipping muscle glycogen was negatively correlated with liver glucose and glycogen. Pipping muscle fat was negatively correlated with liver glucose on d 15 but positively correlated with liver glycogen on d 19. In conclusion, in preparation for hatch between d 15 and 19 of incubation, weights of the liver and pipping muscle of broiler embryos increased relative to their BW. This occurred in association with the accumulation of glucose, glycogen, and protein and with the loss of fat in the pipping muscle. The carbohydrate stores in the pipping muscle were supported by the active metabolism of the liver before 19 d of incubation, which included the transfer of glucose and fatty acids to the pipping muscle via the circulation. Despite the liver's active supply of these nutrient subunits for assimilation and oxidation by the pipping muscle, there was an overall accumulation of hepatic fat between d 15 and 19 of incubation.

Influence of supplemental dietary poultry fat, phytase, and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol on the performance of commercial layers inoculated before or at the onset of lay with F-strain Mycoplasma gallisepticum								POULTRY SCIENCE				89	5			910	916		10.3382/ps.2009-00615			MAY 1 2010	2010	The effects of 2 levels of supplemental dietary poultry fat (PF) and the combination of PF, phytase (PHY), and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (D(3)) on the performance of commercial layers inoculated with F-strain Mycoplasma gallisepticum (FMG) were investigated in 2 trials. Sham and FMG inoculations were administered at 12 (before lay) and 22 (early in lay) wk and dietary treatments [basal control diet (BCD), BCD with 0.75% supplemental PF, BCD with 1.50% supplemental PF, and BCD with 1.50% supplemental PF, 0.013% PHY, and 0.025% D(3)] were initiated at 20 wk of age. Hen BW, egg weight, and egg production (EP) were determined every 4 wk between 24 and 58 wk of age. Feed consumption (FC) and feed conversion were determined in 4-wk intervals beginning on wk 25 and ending on wk 58, and total mortality and mean EP were determined over the entire 24 to 58-wk period. The addition of 0.75 and 1.50% PF increased BW at wk 48 and 58, respectively, and supplemental PF at the 1.50% level increased the BW of hens that had been inoculated (sham or FMG) on wk 22 and reduced the FC of hens inoculated on wk 12. Feed conversion was decreased in the 25 to 28- and 57 to 58-wk age periods and increased in the 45 to 48-wk age periods by an FMG inoculation. In birds inoculated at 22 wk of age, FMG increased egg weight. Although EP was reduced at wk 24 and was increased at wk 58 by FMG, total EP was not affected. In conclusion, an inoculation of FMG at either 12 or 22 wk of age can result in a relative shift in EP from the early to late stage of lay without affecting total EP, and although the BW and FC responses of hens to added dietary PF were influenced by their age and the age of inoculation, use of the supplemental combination of PHY and D(3) had no additional effect on performance when provided in conjunction with 1.50% PF.									3	0	0	1	0	3			0032-5791			WOS:000276893800009	20371842

J	Arai, Yuji								Effects of Dissolved Calcium on Arsenate Sorption at the Kaolinite-Water Interface								SOIL SCIENCE				175	5			207	213		10.1097/SS.0b013e3181dd799d			MAY 2010	2010	The effects of dissolved calcium (Ca) on arsenate (As(V)) reactivity and surface speciation at the kaolinite-water interface were studied as a function of pH using pseudo-equilibrium adsorption/desorption experiments and extended X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy (EXAFS) analyses. The EXAFS analyses indicated that As(V) tetrahedral molecules were coordinated on aluminum octahedral via bidentate binuclear (similar to 3.11 angstrom) bonding at pH 4.5 to 6.75 and total As loading levels of 978 to 1,783 mu mol/L kg(-1). There was no evidence for As(V)-Ca ternary species when both As(V) and Ca were present (0.68-1.3 mmol/L). In the adsorption experiments, As(V) adsorption gradually increased with increasing pH and decreased at pH above 6. Interestingly, As(V) sorption was suppressed when 1 mmol/L of Ca was added to the systems at pH 4 to 8. The As(V) desorption was also pronounced when the systems contained Ca. These macroscopic results indirectly suggest that the weakly sorbed As(V) surface species are outcompeted by the ion-exchange process of Ca at the broken edge site of kaolinite. Results of macroscopic data and EXAFS analysis suggest that both outer-sphere and inner-sphere surface As(V) species might coexist on kaolinite surfaces. In predicting the dissolved As(V) in subsurface environments, weakly sorbed As(V) species might be influenced by not only anionic species, but also cationic species in soil solutions and in pore water. Quantifying the effects of various sorbed cations may be important in predicting arsenic transport processes in subsurface environments.									13	0	0	9	0	13			0038-075X			WOS:000278116800002

These forces often cause movements in directions other than the intended trajectory (i.e., recoil motions), potentially increasing locomotor costs. We quantified rectilinear swimming stability for posthatchling loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and green turtles (Chelonia mydas). Sea turtles predominantly swim via "aquatic flight", which is characterized by synchronous dorsoventral flapping of their forelimbs. We tested four predictions about the effects of "aquatic flight" on stability: (1) it would produce little lateral recoil; (2) lateral recoil motions would be non-cyclic; (3) vertical recoil motions would be larger than lateral recoil motions; and (4) vertical recoil motions would be cyclic. Additionally, because posthatchling loggerheads possess dorsal keels on the shell that are absent in green turtles, we evaluated whether such keels might improve stability in swimming turtles. While our expectations for patterns of cyclicity in recoil motions (predictions 2 and 4) were met, our expectations for differences in their absolute and relative magnitudes (predictions 1 and 3) were not. We suggest that lateral recoil motions were greater than predicted due to slight asynchronies between the motions of the left and right foreflippers. Additionally, although minimum lateral recoil motions were smaller than minimum vertical recoil motions, maximum recoil motions were greater in the lateral direction, so that average recoil did not differ significantly between these directions. Finally, because loggerheads did not display higher levels of stability compared to green turtles, there is little evidence to support a stabilizing role for dorsal keels in loggerhead turtles.

Effect of the Particle Size and Interparticle Distance								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				114	16			7496	7501		10.1021/jp911411x			APR 29 2010	2010	The effect of the particle size and interparticle distance on the coherent plasmon coupling was studied in 2D arrays of silver nanoparticles. The plasmon coupling leads to the formation of a cooperative plasmon mode characterized by an intense and narrow peak in the blue spectral range. The arrays were fabricated via the self-assembly of the nanoparticles on poly(4-vinylpyridine)-modified glass substrates. Changing the ionic strength of the aqueous nanoparticle suspension prior to the self-assembly provided a possibility for controlling the interparticle distance in the arrays. The study revealed an optimum particle size around 86 nm and the corresponding optimum interparticle distance of about 107 nm for the strongest plasmon coupling, as determined from the most intense and sharpest resonance that was observed in water. Changing the dielectric medium will conceivably result in different values for the optimal particle size and interparticle distance.									61	1	0	1	0	61			1932-7447			WOS:000276889300042

In 2000, Time magazine listed tissue engineering as one of the 'hottest 10 career choices'. However, in the past decade, only a handful of tissue-engineered products were translated to the clinical market and none were financially viable. The reality of complex business planning and the high-investment, high-technology environment was not apparent, and the promise of tissue engineering was overstated. In the meantime, biologists were steadily applying three-dimensional benchtop tissue-culture systems for cellular research, but the systems were gelatinous and thus limited in their ability to facilitate the development of complex tissues. Now, the bioengineering literature has seen an emergence of literature describing biofabrication of tissues and organs. However, if one looks closely, again, the viable products appear distant. 'Rapid' prototyping to reproduce the intricate patterns of whole organs using large volumes of cellular components faces daunting challenges. Homogenous forms are being labelled 'tissues', but, in fact, do not represent the heterogeneous structure of the native biological system. In 2003, we disclosed the concept of combining rapid prototyping techniques with tissue engineering technologies to facilitate precision development of heterogeneous complex tissue-test systems, i.e. systems to be used for drug discovery and the study of cellular behaviour, biomedical devices and progression of disease. The focus of this paper is on the challenges we have faced since that time, moving this concept towards reality, using the case of breast tissue as an example.									21	0	0	11	0	21			1364-503X			WOS:000275810800002	20308106

The inferred (16)O-rich composition of the Sun is similar or slightly lighter than the (16)O-rich compositions of amoeboid olivine aggregates and typical calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) from primitive (unmetamorphosed) chondrites (Delta(17)O=-24%+/- 2%), which are believed to have condensed from and been melted in a gas of approximately solar composition (dust/ gas ratio similar to 0.01 by weight) within the first 0.1 Myr of the solar system formation. Based on solar system abundances, 26% of the solar system oxygen must be initially contained in dust and 74% in gas. Because solar oxygen is dominated by the gas component, these observations suggest that oxygen isotopic composition of the solar nebula gas was initially 16O-rich. Due to significant thermal processing of the protosolar molecular cloud silicate dust (primordial dust) in the solar nebula and its possible isotope exchange with the isotopically evolved solar nebula gas, the mean oxygen isotopic composition of the primordial dust is not known. In CO self-shielding models, it is assumed that primordial dust and solar nebula gas had initially identical, (16)O-rich compositions, similar to that of the Sun (Delta(17)O similar to-25% or-35%), and solids subsequently evolved toward the terrestrial value (Delta(17)O=0). However, there is no clear evidence that the oxygen isotopic compositions of the solar system solids evolved in the direction of increasing Delta(17)O with time and no 16O-rich primordial dust have yet been discovered. Here we argue that the assumption of the CO self-shielding models that primordial dust and solar nebula gas had initially identical (16)O-rich compositions is incorrect. We show that igneous CAIs with highly fractionated oxygen isotopic compositions, fractionation and unidentified nuclear effects (FUN), and fractionation (F) CAIs, have Delta(17)O ranging from -0.5% to -24.8%. Within an individual FUN or F CAI, oxygen isotopic compositions of spinel, forsterite, and pyroxene define a mass-dependent fractionation trend with a constant Delta(17)O value. The degree of mass-dependent fractionation of these minerals correlates with the sequence of their crystallization from the host CAI melt. These observations and evaporation experiments on CAI-likemelts indicate that FUN and F CAIs formed by melting of solid precursors with diverse Delta(17)O values in vacuum (total pressure < 10(-6) atm). We interpret the observed range of Delta(17)O values among FUN and F CAIs as the result of varying degrees of equilibration between (16)O-poor dust and (16)O-rich nebular gas and suggest the former is characteristic of the primordial dust. The distinctly different oxygen isotopic compositions of the primordial solar nebula dust and gas could have resulted from Galactic chemical evolution or from pollution of the protosolar molecular cloud by a massive star (>50 circle dot) ejecta.The (16)O-depleted compositions of chondrules, fine-grained matrices, chondrites, and achondrites compared to the Sun's value eflect their formation in the protoplanetary disk regions with enhanced dust/ gas ratio (up to 10(5) x solar).									47	0	0	2	0	47			0004-637X			WOS:000276329400037

This review provides an in-depth overview of the application of chirality to the study of chiral polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), an important group of legacy pollutants. Like other chiral compounds, individual PCB enantiomers may interact enantioselectively (or enantiospecifically) with chiral macromolecules, such as cytochrome P-450 enzymes or ryanodine receptors, leading to differences in their toxicological effects and the enantioselective formation of chiral biotransformation products. Species and congener-specific enantiomer enrichment has been demonstrated in environmental compartments, wildlife, and mammals, including humans, typically due to a complex combination of biotransformation processes and uptake via the diet by passive diffusion. Changes in the enantiomer composition of chiral PCBs in the environment have been used to understand complex aerobic and anaerobic microbial transformation pathways, to delineate and quantify PCB sources and transport in the environment, to gain insight into the biotransformation of PCBs in aquatic food webs, and to investigate the enantioselective disposition of PCBs and their methylsulfonyl PCBs metabolites in rodents. Overall, changes in chiral signatures are powerful, but currently underutilized tools for studies of environmental and biological processes of PCBs.									56	7	0	51	0	62			0013-936X			WOS:000276556000006	20384371

We measured enantiomeric fractions (EFs) of six PCB atropisomers (PCBs 84, 91, 95, 136, 149, and 174) in surface sediment, fine benthic organic matter (FBOM), coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM), periphyton, Asian clam, mayflies, yellowfin shiner, and semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) using gas chromatography (GC-ECD). Nonracemic EFs of PCBs 91, 95, 136, and 149 were measured in almost all samples. Enantiomeric compositions of PCBs 84 and 174 were infrequently detected with racemic EFs measured in samples except for a nonracemic EF of PCB 84 in clams. Nonracemic EFs of PCBs 91, 136, and 149 in SPMDs may be due to desorption of nonracemic residues from FBOM. EFs for some atropisomers were significantly different among FBOM, CPOM, and periphyton, suggesting that their microbial communities have different biotransformation processes. Nonracemic EFs in clams and fish suggest both in vivo biotransformation and uptake of nonracemic residues from their food sources. Longitudinal variability in EFs was generally low among congeners observed in matrices.									16	2	0	15	0	18			0013-936X			WOS:000276556000017	20058914

To date, most examples integrating geophysical measurements in hydrology have followed a three-step, uncoupled inverse approach. This approach begins with independent geophysical inversion to infer the spatial and/or temporal distribution of a geophysical property (e. g., electrical conductivity). The geophysical property is then converted to a hydrologic property (e. g., water content) through a petrophysical relation. The inferred hydrologic property is then used either independently or together with direct hydrologic observations to constrain a hydrologic inversion. We present an alternative approach, coupled inversion, which relies on direct coupling of hydrologic models and geophysical models during inversion. We compare the abilities of coupled and uncoupled inversion using a synthetic example where surface-based electrical conductivity surveys are used to monitor one dimensional infiltration and redistribution. Through this illustrative example, we show that the coupled approach can provide significant reductions in uncertainty for hydrologic properties and associated predictions if the underlying model is a faithful representation of the hydrologic processes. However, if the hydrologic model exhibits structural errors, the coupled inversion may not improve the hydrologic interpretation. Despite this limitation, our results support the use of coupled hydrogeophysical inversion both for the direct benefits of reduced errors during inversion and because of the secondary benefits that accrue because of the extensive communication and sharing of data necessary to produce a coupled model, which will likely lead to more thoughtful use of geophysical data in hydrologic studies.									78	1	0	9	0	79			0043-1397	1944-7973		WOS:000276552300001

The latter compounds were accessed by the use of a new precursor, 2,5-diphosphinohydroquinone. The new compounds were fully characterized, including a structural study of 2,6-tert-butylbenzo[1,2-d;4,5-d']bisoxaphosphole. Quantum yields for photoluminescence were determined for a series of compounds. These materials feature bona fide P=C p-p pi bonds suitable for conjugated materials having phosphorus as a participatory atom and can thus "photocopy" the properties of other conjugated organic molecules.									32	0	0	3	0	32			0002-7863			WOS:000276553600032	20235546

A scalable concept for micropower generation using flow-induced self-excited oscillations								APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS				96	14					144103	10.1063/1.3385780			APR 5 2010	2010	Inspired by music-playing harmonicas that create tones via oscillations of reeds when subjected to air blow, this paper entails a concept for microwind power generation using flow-induced self-excited oscillations of a piezoelectric beam embedded within a cavity. Specifically, when the volumetric flow rate of air past the beam exceeds a certain threshold, the energy pumped into the structure via nonlinear pressure forces offsets the system's intrinsic damping setting the beam into self-sustained limit-cycle oscillations. The vibratory energy is then converted into electricity through principles of piezoelectricity. Experimental and theoretical results are presented demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed concept.									32	2	0	0	0	33			0003-6951			WOS:000276554600105		
J	Liu, Bing; Creager, Stephen								Carbon xerogels as Pt catalyst supports for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel-cell applications								JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES				195	7	SI		1812	1820		10.1016/j.jpowsour.2009.10.033			APR 2 2010	2010	Carbon xerogels prepared by the resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) sol-gel method with ambient-pressure drying were explored as Pt catalyst supports for polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells. Carbon xerogel samples without Pt catalyst(CX) were characterized by the N(2) sorption method (BET, BJH, others), and carbon xerogel samples with supported Pt catalyst (Pt/CX) were characterized by thermogravimetry (TGA), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron microscopy (SEM, TEM) and ex situ cyclic voltammetry for thin-film electrode samples supported on glassy carbon and studied in a sulfuric acid electrolyte. Experiments on Pt/CX were made in comparison with commercially obtained samples of Pt catalyst supported on a Vulcan XC-72R carbon black support (Pt/XC-72R). CX samples had high BET surface area with a relatively narrow pore size distribution with a peak pore size near 14 nm. Pt contents for both Pt/CX and Pt/XC-72R were near 20wt% as determined by TGA. Pt catalyst particles on Pt/CX had a mean diameter near 3.3 nm. slightly larger than for Pt/XC-72R which was near 2.8 nm. Electrochemically active surface areas (ESA) for Pt as determined by ex situ CV measurements of H adsorption/desorption were similar for Pt/XC-72R and Pt/CX but those from CO stripping were slightly higher for Pt/XC-72R than for Pt/CX. Membrane-electrode assemblies (MEAs) were fabricated from both Pt/CX and Pt/XC-72R on Nafion 117 membranes using the decal transfer method, and MEA characteristics and single-cell performance were evaluated via in situ cyclic voltammetry, polarization curve, and current-interrupt and high-frequency impedance methods. In situ CV yielded ESA values for Pt/XC-72R MEAs that were similar to those obtained by ex situ CV in sulfuric acid, but those for Pt/CX MEAs were smaller(by 13-17%), suggesting that access of Nafion electrolyte to Pt particles in Pt/CX electrodes is diminished relative to that for Pt/XC-72R electrodes. Polarization curve analysis at low current density (0.9V cell voltage) reveals slightly higher intrinsic catalyst activity for the Pt/CX catalyst which may reflect the fact that Pt particle size in these catalysts is slightly higher. Cell performance at higher current densities is slightly lower for Pt/CX than the Pt/XC-72R sample, however after normalization for Pt loading, performance is slightly higher for Pt/CX, particularly in H(2)/O(2) and at lower cell temperatures (50 degrees C). This latter finding may reflect a possible lower mass-transfer resistance in the Pt/CX sample. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									26	2	0	0	0	27			0378-7753			WOS:000273883400008

We show that, in slit pores with pore widths between 10 and 14.7 angstrom, the K(+) ion distribution differs qualitatively from that described by classical electrical double-layer (EDL) theories in that fully hydrated K(+) ions accumulate primarily in the central plane of the slit pores. This phenomenon disappears when the pore width is narrower than 10 angstrom. Ion hydration and water water interactions, which are rarely considered in prior EDL theories for micropores, are found to be responsible for this behavior. On the basis of these results, we have developed a new sandwich capacitance model to describe the capacitance of the EDLs formed by K(+) ions enclosed in slit-shaped micropores. This model is capable of predicting the anomalous enhancement of capacitance experimentally observed in micropores.									65	2	0	1	0	65			1936-0851			WOS:000276956800074	20364850

A laser diagnostic technique based on photodissociation spectroscopy (PDS) is proposed to address this need. This paper describes the concept of the PDS-based diagnostic, reports its experimental demonstration in a non-premixed jet flame, and assesses its performance and applicable range. This new technique is centered around the creative use of photodissociation (PD) for flow visualization. A carefully chosen PD precursor is seeded into the flow of interest to measure mixture fraction. The precursor is chosen such that (I) both the precursor itself and the products formed from the precursor (if it reacts) can be completely and rapidly photodissociated; thus, the concentration of one of the photofragments forms a conserved scalar and can he used to infer the mixture fraction, and (2) the target photofragment offers friendly spectroscopic properties (e.g., strong laser-induced fluorescence signals and/or simple signal interpretation) so multidimensional imaging can be readily obtained. Molecular iodine (I(2)) was identified as a precursor satisfying both requirements and was seeded into a carbon monoxide (CO) air jet flame for single-shot two-dimensional imaging of mixture fraction. This demonstration illustrates the potential of the PDS-based technique to overcome the limitations of existing techniques and to provide multidimensional measurements of mixture fraction in a variety of reactive flows.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0003-7028			WOS:000277001200004	20412621

All cause symptoms similar to those previously attributed to infection by TSV alone. Although similarities exist among the genomic sequences of the three, phylogenetic analysis shows them to be distinct viruses. These viruses and Parietaria mottle virus, the other currently accepted member of subgroup 1, appear to have evolved from a common ancestral virus, share conserved motifs in the products of the genomic RNAs, and constitute a distinct subgroup within the genus.									9	0	0	8	1	10			0304-8608			WOS:000276125900014	20195656

General methods for the synthesis of electroconductive hydrogels as polymer blends and as polymer co-networks via chemical oxidative, electrochemical and/or a combination of chemical oxidation followed by electrochemical polymerization techniques are reviewed. Specific examples are introduced to illustrate the preparation of electroconductive hydrogels that were synthesized from poly(HEMA)-based hydrogels with polyaniline and from poly(HEMA)-based hydrogels with polypyrrole. The key applications of electroconductive hydrogels; as biorecognition membranes for implantable biosensors, as electrostimulated drug release devices for programmed delivery, and as the low interfacial impedance layers on neuronal prostheses are highlighted. These applications provide great new horizons for these stimuli responsive, biomimetic polymeric materials. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We modify existing models to account for heat sources of finite (non-zero) area, such as formed by a sun patch warming the floor of a room. Our model allows for predictions of the steady stratification and ventilation flow rates that develop in a room due to a circular heat source at floor level. We compare our theoretical predictions with predictions for the limiting cases of a point source of heat (yielding a stratified interior), and a uniformly heated floor (yielding a mixed interior). Our theory shows a smooth transition between these two limits, which themselves result in extremes of ventilation, as the ratio of the heat source radius to the room height increases. Our model for the transition from displacement to mixing ventilation is compared to previous work and demonstrates that the transition can occur for smaller sources than previously thought, particularly for rooms with large floor area compared to ceiling height.

J	Cicimurri, David J.								On the dentition of Meridiania convexa Case (Myliobatoidea), an extinct Early Eocene ray from the United States.								Cainozoic Research				7	1-2			99	107					April 2010	2010	A highly fossiliferous Ypresian (lower Eocene) deposit located in Berkeley County, South Carolina, yielded a very diverse elasmobranch assemblage that includes Meridiania convexa Case, 1994. More than 1,800 complete and partial teeth have been recovered, and this sample allows for a more complete understanding of tooth morphology and organization of the dentition. The dentition of Meridiania consisted of a closely packed (but not rigid) arrangement of teeth, with a single row of very wide medial teeth and multiple rows of progressively more symmetrical lateral teeth. Tooth bases are polyaulocorhizous in medial and mesially located lateral teeth, but those of distal lateral teeth are most often holaulocorhizous. Previous assignment of Meridiania to Dasyatidae is rejected in favor of Myliobatidae. Ontogenetic heterodonty is indicated by a change in crown morphology with increased tooth size, with small teeth (juveniles) having a distinct transverse ridge, and large teeth (adults) having more uniformly convex crowns. Extreme wear through in vivo usage suggests that teeth were retained for a long period of time, and the diet of Meridiania consisted of hard-shelled invertebrates. All known occurrences of Meridiania are from coastal plain strata of Ypresian age, and the paleogeographic distribution extends from eastern Texas into northeastern Virginia, USA.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1570-0399			ZOOREC:ZOOR14610071127

To assess the possible effects of ash on seed germination and viability of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.), black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) Britton, Sterns, Poggenb.), white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss), and balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.), a laboratory experiment was conducted using ash derived from three types of forest floor samples. The samples represented areas of high conifer concentration, high aspen concentration, and mixed aspen and conifer and were collected from five mature aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) - conifer mixedwood stands in southeastern Manitoba. Ash derived from each forest floor type neither prohibited nor delayed conifer germination, except that of balsam fir. Balsam fir had significantly less germination on ash derived from forest floor samples with high aspen concentration. When corrected for seed viability, balsam fir had significantly less germination on all three ash types compared with jack pine, black spruce, and white spruce. However, the impact of ash on balsam fir is unlikely to have meaningful ecological implications, as balsam fir is a climax species and will establish in undisturbed mature forests.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0045-5067			WOS:000277477300021

The objective of this study was to characterize CPLSW and to discern potential constituents of concern that may affect aquatic biota in receiving systems. Characterization of CPLSW included analyses of metals, oil and grease, and general water chemistry. Toxicity tests were performed using two sentinel species, Ceriodaphnia dubia Richard and Pimephales promelas Rafinesque. Metals measured (at their maximum) in CPLSW included 4756 mu g Al L(-1), 53 mu g Cu L(-1), 130 mu g Pb L(-1), and 908 mu g Zn L(-1). Although CPLSW varied widely in composition and toxicity, constituents of concern included: pH, alkalinity, total suspended solids, biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, metals, and oil and grease. Fish (P. promelas) were more sensitive to CPLSW than C dubia with decreased survival in 92% and 15% of the samples (n = 13), respectively. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Yuan Haina; Yao Shanjing; You Yuru; Xiao Gongnian; You Qi								Antioxidant Activity of Isothiocyanate Extracts from Broccoli								CHINESE JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING				18	2			312	321					APR 2010	2010	Isothiocyanates (ITCs) extracts were prepared from fresh broccoli. Their antioxidant properties were evaluated by using the in vitro bioassays, including superoxide anion radical (O(2)), hydroxyl radical (HO center dot(-)) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydracyl (DPPH center dot) radical-scavenging methods, lipid peroxidation assay, and reducing power assay. The ITCs extracts exhibited significant dose-dependent antioxidant activities (P<0.01). Its antioxidant-stability was affected by temperature and storage condition, although it was more stable than vitamin C (Vc). GC-MS identified sulforaphane in the ITCs extracts. The antioxidant activity of sulforaphane was approximately one tenth to one fifth of that of Vc. Sulforaphane was experimented to be one of dominating contributors to antioxidant capacity of ITCs extracts. However, there was no direct antioxidant activity found for benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) in vitro. Therefore, it could be concluded that the general group (-N=C=-S) was not the essential part for the antioxidant activity of sulforaphane. It is suggested that the ITCs extracts from broccoli can be developed into a promising food additive for healthy food.									4	1	0	2	0	5			1004-9541			WOS:000277636900019

The algorithm is based on solving the multiple objective shortest path problem on an underlying network. Algorithms for constructing four network models, all representing the MOIKP, are also presented. Each network is composed of layers and each network algorithm, working forward layer by layer, identifies the set of all permanent nondominated labels for each layer. The effectiveness of the algorithms is supported with numerical results obtained for randomly generated problems for up to seven objectives while exact algorithms reported in the literature solve the multiple objective binary knapsack problem with up to three objectives. Extensions of the approach to other classes of problems including binary variables, bounded variables. multiple constraints, and time-dependent objective functions are possible.

In ascending stratigraphic order, these highest-occurrence interval zones are the Osculapollis vestibulus (Ov) Biozone, the Holkopollenites propinquus (Hp) Biozone, the Holkopollenites forix (Hf) Biozone, the Complexiopollis abditus (Ca) Biozone, and the Osculapollis aequalis (Oa) Biozone. These biozones are based on an analysis of more than 400 subsurface and outcrop samples throughout the Coastal Plain Province of South Carolina, and the adjacent states of Georgia and North Carolina. Integration of the biostratigraphy with lithostratigraphy and geophysical log data suggests that the lower and upper boundaries of each biozone are bounded by regional unconformities. Five new species are described, and an emendation is presented for one additional species. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									5	0	0	4	0	5			0195-6671			WOS:000275588600001

A variety of force fields have been used to separate particles in microfluidic devices, among which electric field may be the most popular one due to its general applicability and adaptability. So far, however, electrophoresis-based separations have been limited primarily to batchwise processes. Dielectrophoresis (DEP)-based separations require in-channel micro-electrodes or micro-insulators to produce electric field gradients. This article introduces a novel particle separation technique in DC electrokinetic flow through a planar double-spiral microchannel. The continuous separation arises from the cross-stream dielectrophoretic motion of particles induced by the non-uniform electric field inherent to curved channels. Specifically, particles are focused by DEP to one sidewall of the first spiral, and then dielectrophoretically deflected toward the other sidewall of the second spiral at a particle-dependent rate, leading to focused particle streams along different flow paths. This DEP-based particle separation technique is demonstrated in an asymmetric double-spiral microchannel by continuously separating a mixture of 5/10 mu m particles and 3/5 mu m particles.									38	0	0	22	0	38			0173-0835			WOS:000277778900014	20301126

Results demonstrated that both interventions led to significant reductions in weight, but the spiritually based intervention led to additional improvements.

Fifty-two adolescents (22 males, 30 females; ages 10-14 years, 85% African-American) participated in a focus group (6-10 per group, same gender). Focus groups were audiotaped, transcribed and coded by independent raters. Inter-rater reliabilities indicated adequate agreement [inter-rater reliability (r) = 0.84]. Themes were identified for parental role modeling and parental social support. Regarding parental role modeling, adolescents reported that parents engaged in a variety of different types of physical activities with their children such as walking, cycling and playing basketball; however, activity was infrequent. Sex differences were noted in parental social support indicating that female adolescents reported receiving more emotional and negative support for physical activity (being required to play outside with a sibling), while boys reported receiving more tangible types of support for physical activity. Adolescents also generated ideas on how to increase parental social support and in particular tangible support was highlighted as important by both males and females. This study suggests that future interventions should focus on improving parental engagement and tangible support that involve direct participation from parents in physical activities with their adolescents.									31	0	0	4	1	31			0268-1153			WOS:000275818400005	18703530	
J	Griffin, Sarah F.; Wilcox, Sara; Ory, Marcia G.; Lattimore, Diana; Leviton, Laura; Castro, Cynthia; Carpenter, Ruth Ann; Rheaume, Carol								Results from the Active for Life process evaluation: program delivery fidelity and adaptations								HEALTH EDUCATION RESEARCH				25	2			325	342		10.1093/her/cyp017			APR 2010	2010	Active for Life (R) (AFL) was a large (n = 8159) translational initiative to increase physical activity (PA) in midlife and older adults. Translational research calls for a shift in emphasis from just understanding what works (efficacy) to also understanding how it works in more 'real world' settings. This article describes the process evaluation design and findings, discuss how these findings were used to better understand the translational process and provide a set of process evaluation recommendations with community-based translational research. AFL community organizations across the United States implemented one of two evidence-based PA programs (Active Living Every Day-The Cooper Institute; Human Kinetics Inc. or Active Choices-Stanford University). Both programs were based on the transtheoretical model and social cognitive theory. Overall, the process evaluation revealed high-dose delivery and implementation fidelity by quite varied community organizations serving diverse adult populations. Findings reveal most variation occurred for program elements requiring more participant engagement. Additionally, the results show how a collaborative process allowed the organizations to 'fit' the programs to their specific participant base while maintaining fidelity to essential program elements.									16	0	0	2	1	17			0268-1153			WOS:000275818400014	19325031

String Blossom Thinner Designed for Variable Tree Forms Increases Crop Load Management Efficiency in Trials in Four United States Peach-growing Regions								HORTTECHNOLOGY				20	2			409	414					APR 2010	2010	Hand thinning is a necessary and costly management practice in peach (Prunus persica) production. Stone fruit producers are finding it increasingly difficult to find a workforce to manually thin fruit crops, and the cost of farm labor is increasing. A new "hybrid" string thinner prototype designed to adjust crop load in vase or angled tree canopies was evaluated in processing and fresh fruit plantings in varying production systems in four U.S. growing regions in 2009. Data were uniformly collected across regions to determine blossom removal rate, fruit set, labor required for follow-up green fruit hand thinning, fruit size distribution at harvest, yield, and economic impact. String thinner trials with the variable tree forms demonstrated reduced labor costs compared with hand-thinned controls and increased crop value due to a larger distribution of fruit in marketable and higher market value sizes. Blossom removal ranged from 17% to 56%, hand thinning requirement was reduced by 19% to 100%, and fruit yield and size distribution improved in at least one string-thinning treatment per experiment. Net economic impact at optimum tractor and spindle speeds was $462 to $1490 and $264 to $934 per acre for processing and fresh market peaches, respectively. Case study interviews of growers who thinned a total of 154 acres indicated that commercial adoption of string-thinning technology would likely have positive impacts on the work place environment.									12	1	0	7	0	13			1063-0198			WOS:000281496900021

We report detailed mapping in extended TAPVR kindreds and mutation analysis in TAPVR patients that implicate the PDGFRA gene in the development of TAPVR. Gene expression studies in mouse and chick embryos for both the Pdgfra receptor and its ligand Pdgf-a show temporal and spatial patterns consistent with a role in pulmonary vein (PV) development. We used an in ovo function blocking assay in chick and a conditional knockout approach in mouse to knock down Pdgfra expression in the developing venous pole during the period of PV formation. We observed that loss of PDGFRA function in both organisms causes TAPVR with low penetrance (similar to 7%) reminiscent of that observed in our human TAPVR kindreds. Intermediate inflow tract anomalies occurred in a higher percentage of embryos (similar to 30%), suggesting that TAPVR occurs at one end of a spectrum of defects. We show that the anomalous pulmonary venous connection seen in chick and mouse is highly similar to TAPVR discovered in an abnormal early stage embryo from the Kyoto human embryo collection. Whereas the embryology of the normal venous pole and PV is becoming understood, little is known about the embryogenesis or molecular pathogenesis of TAPVR. These models of TAPVR provide important insight into the pathogenesis of PV defects. Taken together, these data from human genetics and animal models support a role for PDGF-signaling in normal PV development, and in the pathogenesis of TAPVR.									25	0	0	22	0	25			0964-6906			WOS:000275818500012	20071345

An analysis of the array properties in the strongly coupled regime is provided in this paper. Previous analyses of COAs have employed a so-called broadband condition that substantially simplifies analysis. The broadband condition is observed to break down in the strongly coupled regime, a feature that is central in the understanding of the behavior of strongly coupled arrays. The observed improvement in the phase noise performance can be attributed to the highly resonant nature of the coupling network in the strongly coupled regime. The theory is verified using a five-element linear COA operating at 3.75 GHz. Significant improvements in the MILR and phase noise is reported. The beam steering capabilities of strongly coupled arrays are also presented.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0018-926X			WOS:000276414500007

Phase equilibrium measurements for the I(2)-H(2)O and I(2)-HI-H(2)O systems of the sulfur-iodine cycle using a continuous-flow apparatus								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				35	8			3347	3357		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2010.01.136			APR 2010	2010	Liquid-liquid equilibrium (LLE) phase behavior was investigated for the binary iodine-water (I(2)-H(2)O) and the ternary iodine-hydroiodic acid-water (I(2)-HI-H(2)O) at the elevated temperatures and pressures of interest for the reactive distillation column of the Sulfur-Iodine Cycle. A continuous-flow apparatus, with wetted parts fabricated from tantalum-tungsten alloys, was designed and constructed for the highly corrosive conditions of this work. A central feature of the apparatus is the equilibrium view cell, which allows for the observation and discernment of vapor-liquid, liquid-liquid, and liquid-liquid-vapor equilibria for HIx systems.For the I(2)-H(2)O system, LLE was observed at temperatures and pressures to 300 degrees C and 104 bar. Based on our observations, we estimate that the upper critical solution temperature for this system occurs at 310-315 degrees C. For the I(2)-HI-H(2)O ternary, VLE, LLE, and LLVE were all observed at 160 and 200 degrees C, and three compositions on the water-rich side of the LLE phase envelope were determined.

A 41-item survey instrument was developed to collect data regarding national level collegiate hammer throwers throughout the United States. Multiple regression analysis for hammer throw personal record (PR) yielded a significant model (r=0.811, p <= 0.001) with the following predictors: number of throws per year, number of years throwing the hammer, NCAA division, back squat, and type of hammer technique. The model explained in excess of 65% of the variance in hammer technique among the respondents (r(2)=0.658). These results provide quantitative information for coaches and athletes involved in the hammer throw event about the importance of years of experience, volume of training and strength levels. Furthermore, the results may provide some insight into the obstacles and barriers limiting the development of US hammer throwers.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1474-8185			WOS:000208327400007		
J	Marshall, Jeff C.; Smart, Julie; Horton, Robert M.								THE DESIGN AND VALIDATION OF EQUIP: AN INSTRUMENT TO ASSESS INQUIRY-BASED INSTRUCTION								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS EDUCATION				8	2			299	321					APR 2010	2010	To monitor and evaluate program success and to provide teachers with a tool that could support their transformation in teaching practice, we needed an effective and valid protocol to measure the quantity and quality of inquiry-based instruction being led. Existing protocols, though helpful, were either too generic or too program specific. Consequently, we developed the Electronic Quality of Inquiry Protocol (EQUIP). This manuscript examines the 2-year development cycle for the creation and validation of EQUIP. The protocol evolved over several iterations and was supported by validity checks and confirmatory factor analysis. The protocol's strength is further supported by high internal consistency and solid interrater agreement. The resulting protocol assesses 19 indicators aligned with four constructs: instruction, curriculum, assessment, and discourse. For teachers, EQUIP provides a framework to make their instructional practice more intentional as they strive to increase the quantity and quality of inquiry instruction. For researchers, EQUIP provides an instrument to analyze the quantity and quality of inquiry being implemented, which can be beneficial in evaluating professional development projects.									14	0	0	1	0	14			1571-0068			WOS:000292146300005

This is addressed by applying a comprehensive set of characterization techniques to study the electrical properties of solution-grown Al-doped ZnO nanowires as a function of composition from 0 to 4 at. % Al:Zn. Carrier mobility and charge density extracted from sensitive optical absorption measurements are in agreement with those extracted from single- wire field-effect transistor devices. The mobility in undoped nanowires is 28 cm(2)/V s and decreases to similar to 14 cm(2)/V s at the highest doping density, though the carrier density remains approximately constant (10(20) cm(-3)) due to limited dopant activation or the creation of charge-compensating defects. Additionally, the local geometry of the Al dopant is studied by nuclear magnetic resonance, showing the occupation of a variety of dopant sites. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

These structures were characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction using a full-matrix least squares method. The K3Th2(PO4)(3)F-2 compound crystallizes in C2/c (No. 15) with a = 15.8179(15) angstrom, b = 9.8172(8) angstrom, c = 9.6472(9) angstrom, beta = 121.132(7)degrees, Z = 4 and R-1 = 0.0329. This structure contains two large open channels possibly suitable for incorporating radioactive cesium isotopes for waste storage.

Development of Sampling Plans For Cotton Bolls Injured by Stink Bugs (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae)								JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY				103	2			525	532		10.1603/EC09290			APR 2010	2010	Cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L., bolls were sampled in commercial fields for stink bug (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) injury during 2007 and 2008 in South Carolina and Georgia. Across both years of this study, boll-injury percentages averaged 14.8 +/- 0.3 (SEM). At average boll injury treatment levels of 10, 20, 30, and 50%, the percentage of samples with at least one injured boll was 82, 97, 100, and 100%, respectively. Percentage of field-sampling date combinations with average injury <10, 20, 30, and 50% was 35, 80, 95, and 99%, respectively. At the average of 14.8% boll injury or 2.9 injured bolls per 20-boll sample, 112 samples at D(x) = 0.1 (within 10% of the mean) were required for population estimation, compared with only 15 samples at D(x) = 0.3. Using a sample size of 20 bolls, our study indicated that, at the 10% threshold and alpha = beta = 0.2 (with 80% confidence), control was not needed when <1.03 bolls were injured. The sampling plan required continued sampling for a range of 1.03-3.8 injured bolls per 20-boll sample. Only when injury was >3.8 injured bolls per 20-boll sample was a control measure needed. Sequential sampling plans were also determined for thresholds of 20, 30, and 50% injured bolls.

Risk and Protective Factors for Psychological Adjustment Among Low-Income, African American Children								JOURNAL OF FAMILY ISSUES				31	4			423	444		10.1177/0192513X09348488			APR 2010	2010	This investigation identifies unique risk and protective factors for internalizing and externalizing problems among 8- to 12-year-old, low-income, African American children and tests cumulative risk and protective models. A total of 152 mother-child dyads complete questionnaires. Receipt of food stamps, mother's distress, and child maltreatment increase children's risk for internalizing and externalizing problems and family functioning ( adaptability, cohesion), and after-school program participation ( externalizing only) are protective against internalizing and externalizing problems. A cumulative risk model reveals that compared with youth with no risk factors, having one risk factor confers three-and fivefold risk for internalizing and externalizing symptoms, respectively. Having two or three risk factors confers 12 and 19 times greater risk for internalizing and externalizing symptoms, respectively. Compared with no protective factors, youth with two protective factors are 4 and 6 times less likely to display internalizing and externalizing problems, respectively. Implications for community-based preventive intervention efforts and future research are discussed.									16	0	0	0	0	16			0192-513X	1552-5481		WOS:000275037600001

ASM CITY OF MATERIALS: INTERACTING IN A VIRTUAL WORLD								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS EDUCATION				32	1-2			39	51					APR 2010	2010	The ASM City of Materials website (www.cityofmaterials.com) is an interactive environment where students of all ages can experience how Materials Science and Engineering impacts their daily lives. This is a novel example of K-12 outreach sponsored by a professional society that largely relied on the efforts of volunteers for development. The cornerstone of the site is the "City Tour" interactive game, where students are free to roam the City finding the connection between everyday items they know and the materials concepts behind them (for example, table salt and its simple cubic crystal structure). Website visitors can take on the challenge of solving the City of Materials mysteries at the fictitious Austen Detective Agency and the Griffith CSI Lab. These mystery cases are solved by visitors gathering samples, analyzing 'clues' found in the City using a fully stocked virtual lab (working stereoscope, tensile tester, FTIR, image analysis, chromatography and pH workstations), and arriving at a logical solution to the mystery. The ASM web community also offers podcasts written by college students to introduce a myriad of ideas in an easy listening format on Materials Radio, fun hands-on activities that enable students to experiment in their own home, and a basic introduction to materials science as well as a wide array of links to other sites. Combined, the City of Materials offers a fun and exciting virtual hands-on method for students to explore a variety of materials issues.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0738-7989			WOS:000295812600005

Specifically, reliability of a suspension system component from a high-mobility multipurpose wheeled vehicle which typically can fail under low-cycle strain-based fatigue conditions is analyzed. Toward that end, the most advanced reliability-based design optimization methods available in the literature were combined with the present understanding of low-cycle fatigue durability and applied to the component in question. This entailed intricate integration of several computational tools such as multibody vehicle dynamics, finite-element simulations, and fatigue strain-life assessment/prediction techniques. The results obtained clearly revealed the importance of consideration of material property uncertainties in attaining vehicle performance of critical structural components in complex systems (e.g., a vehicle).									10	1	0	0	0	10			1059-9495			WOS:000275541100001

The model includes an equation of state which reveals the material response under hydrostatic pressure, a strength model which captures material elastic-plastic response under shear, and a failure model which defines the laws and conditions for the initiation and evolution of damage and ultimate failure of the material under negative pressure and/or shear. The model was first parameterized using various open-literature experimental results and property correlation analyses and, then, validated by comparing the computational results obtained in an ANSYS/Autodyn-based transient non-linear dynamics analysis of detonation of a landmine buried in sandy-clay with their experimental counterparts.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1059-9495			WOS:000275541100017

Specifically, the effects of light intensity, concentration of an added deactivator, tetraethylthiuram disulfide (TED), and initial photoiniferter (PI) concentration on the reinitiation ability of surface-tethered PMMA layers is examined in detail. The simulations show that while increases in [TED] and decreases in light intensity affect overall rates of PMMA layer growth in a similar fashion, their effect on reinitiation ability of PMMA layers is significantly different: reinitiation ability increases with increasing [TED] but it is not improved by decreases in light intensity. Simulations also suggest that polymer layers synthesized in the presence of TED have a greater tendency to form surface-tethered block copolymers upon reinitiation compared with polymer layers synthesized without TED and at lower light intensity. While both [PI] and [TED] affect the reinitiation ability, the effect of [TED] on reinitiation ability is identical at a given [TED]/[PI] ratio for all PI and TED concentrations tested. These findings obtained from the rate-based model are instrumental in delineating strategies for creating tethered block copolymer layers or mixed brushes by SI-PMP. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We show that light beaming in mid-infrared is mainly controlled by spoof surface plasmons. We take account of both the dispersion relation and the phase-matching condition of spoof surface plasmons to obtain good beaming efficiency. Through engineering the geometrical parameters of the grating structures, we can achieve the desired near-field and far-field distribution in mid-infrared.

Four different retort pouch structures were used: Cast polypropylene (CPP); polyethylene terephthalate (PET)/silicon oxide-coated nylon/CPP (SIOX); Aluminum oxide-coated PET/nylon/CPP (ALOX); PET/aluminum foil/CPP (FOIL). To determine the amount of lipid oxidation in the salmon, thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) was measured. Salmon packaged in SIOX pouches had higher TBARS value, 43.53 mili-extinction/g, than salmon packaged in FOIL pouches, 37.06 mili-extinction/g, after 8 weeks of storage. A multiple comparisons test was used to evaluate the sensory characteristics of the salmon. Salmon packaged in SIOX pouches had less acceptability, 4.11, than salmon packaged in FOIL pouches, 5.44, after week 8. Conversely, salmon packaged in ALOX pouches had similar sensory and TBARS value with salmon packaged in FOIL pouches. The barrier properties of each pouch material were also investigated. Oxygen permeability (OP, g mu m/m(2) day kPa) of SIOX increased from 0.88 to 10.55 after retort processing. SIOX had an OP of 10.94 at week 8 while ALOX and FOIL had 0.51 and 0.47 of OP, respectively. Overall, shelf stable salmon packaged in ALOX had a shelf life comparable to salmon packaged in a traditional FOIL pouch material, while salmon packaged in SIOX had a significantly lower shelf life then either ALOX or FOIL (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Rapid automated detection of roots in minirhizotron images								MACHINE VISION AND APPLICATIONS				21	3			309	317		10.1007/s00138-008-0179-2			APR 2010	2010	An approach for rapid, automatic detection of plant roots in minirhizotron images is presented. The problem is modeled as a Gibbs point process with a modified Candy model, in which the energy functional is minimized using a greedy algorithm whose parameters are determined in a data-driven manner. The speed of the algorithm is due in part to the selection of seed points, which discards more than 90% of the data from consideration in the first step. Root segments are formed by grouping seed points into piecewise linear structures, which are further combined and validated using geometric techniques. After root centerlines are found, root regions are detected using a recursively bottom-up region growing method. Experimental results from a collection of diverse root images demonstrate improved accuracy and faster performance compared with previous approaches.									3	1	0	2	0	4			0932-8092			WOS:000276149200009

This family of models has the well-known NS-alpha model as its zeroth-order model, and applies the Nth van Cittert deconvolution operator to the filtered terms in NS-alpha to create the Nth-order NS-alpha-deconvolution model. This model is proposed in Ref. 29, where it is shown to have consistency error O(alpha(2N+2)). Herein we prove that the model admits unique regular solutions, is frame invariant, and improves the consistency error of NS-alpha from O(alpha(2)) to O(alpha(2N+2)) while requiring (N + 1)(1/2) times more (typically 1 <= N <= 5) degrees of freedom for complete resolution. Numerical experiments show that adding approximate deconvolution to NS-alpha significantly improves accuracy in computations.									15	0	0	0	0	15			0218-2025	1793-6314		WOS:000280852900005

Though this property was attributed to the presence of defects, systematic experimental and theoretical studies to pinpoint its origin and mechanism are lacking. While it is widely believed that oxygen vacancies are responsible for FM ordering, surprisingly we rand that annealing as-prepared samples at low temperature (high temperature) in flowing oxygen actually enhances (diminishes) the FM ordering. For these reasons, we have prepared, annealed in different environments, and measured the ensuing magnetization in micrometer and nanoscale ZnO with varying crystallinity. We further find from our magnetization measurements and ab initio calculations that a range of magnetic properties in ZnO can result, depending on the sample preparation and annealing conditions. For example, within the same ZnO sample we have observed ferro- to para- and diamagnetic responses depending on the annealing conditions. We also explored the effects of surface states on the magnetic behavior of nanoscale ZnO through detailed calculations.									70	0	0	1	0	70			1530-6984			WOS:000276557100051	20196539

At temperatures about twice the Debye temperature, the phonon mean-free path approaches the value of the average Cd-Cd spacing while the specific heat is at values notably lower than the classical Dulong-Petit limit. We show that a model that treats Cd ions as Einstein oscillators embedded in a Debye host with strong optical-acoustic phonon coupling and some very high-frequency optical phonon modes in the system, can account for these features. Despite no structural change, kappa(latt) undergoes a smooth slope change at similar to 340 K, above which the resistivity adopts a weak power-law behavior. The combined results of resistivity, thermopower, specific-heat, thermalconductivity, and Hall coefficient measurements corroborate that a phonon-mediated electron-hole scattering mechanism sets in above room temperature.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1098-0121			WOS:000277207900032

The first step in this metabolic pathway is mediated by hexokinase (TbHK), an enzyme essential to the parasite that transfers the gamma-phospho of ATP to a hexose. Here we describe the identification and confirmation of novel small molecule inhibitors of bacterially expressed TbHK1, one of two TbHKs expressed by T. brucei, using a high throughput screening assay.Methodology/Principal Findings: Exploiting optimized high throughput screening assay procedures, we interrogated 220,233 unique compounds and identified 239 active compounds from which ten small molecules were further characterized. Computation chemical cluster analyses indicated that six compounds were structurally related while the remaining four compounds were classified as unrelated or singletons. All ten compounds were similar to 20-17,000-fold more potent than lonidamine, a previously identified TbHK1 inhibitor. Seven compounds inhibited T. brucei blood stage form parasite growth (0.03 <= EC(50)<3 mu M) with parasite specificity of the compounds being demonstrated using insect stage T. brucei parasites, Leishmania promastigotes, and mammalian cell lines. Analysis of two structurally related compounds, ebselen and SID 17387000, revealed that both were mixed inhibitors of TbHK1 with respect to ATP. Additionally, both compounds inhibited parasite lysate-derived HK activity. None of the compounds displayed structural similarity to known hexokinase inhibitors or human African trypanosomiasis therapeutics.Conclusions/Significance: The novel chemotypes identified here could represent leads for future therapeutic development against the African trypanosome.									26	0	0	23	0	26			1935-2727			WOS:000277240400017	20405000

To gain a better understanding of the hostplant range of T nigrina, its hosts were recorded during fieldwork, mainly in the southern United States (62 sites, 12 states), from 1995 to 2009. Plants on which nymphs were observed belonged to the asterid families Plantaginaceae (2 spp.), Scrophulariaceae (5 spp.), and Verbenaceae (7 spp.). Twelve of the 14 plant species represent new host records. The tingid was found most often on Aureolaria pectinata (Scrophulariaceae), Plantago aristata (Plantaginaceae), and Glandularia and Verbena spp. (Verbenaceae). Nymphs were observed on upper and lower leaf surfaces and reproductive structures, with foliar chlorosis evident on the upper surfaces and dark excrement on lower surfaces; severe feeding resulted in the death of Mimulus X hybridus (Scrophulariaceae) in a landscape planting. Irregular sampling of T nigrina at Clemson, South Carolina, and elsewhere in southeastern states suggests that adults overwinter and that at least two annual generations are produced.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0013-8797			WOS:000278713900012

Global selection procedures cannot sufficiently account for local sparseness of the covariate nor can they adapt to local curvature of the regression function. We propose a new method for selecting local smoothing parameters which takes into account sparseness and adapts to local curvature. A Bayesian type argument provides an initial smoothing parameter which adapts to the local sparseness of the covariate and provides the basis for local bandwidth selection procedures which further adjust the bandwidth according to the local curvature of the regression function. Simulation evidence indicates that the proposed method can result in reduction of both pointwise mean squared error and integrated mean squared error. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Previous studies have reported a locus of major effect from PPV resistance on linkage group 1. The current study confirms these results by mapping plum pox virus resistance in a F1 progeny issued from a cross between "Harlayne", as a PPV-resistant parent, and "Vestar" as a susceptible parent. The hybrids were grafted simultaneously and subsequently inoculated with the PPV-M and D strains. The symptom scoring on leaves was performed nine times over two vegetative cycles. Marker-trait associations were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis (KW) non-parametric test, and the PPV resistance loci were mapped using composite interval mapping (CIM). We show that both analyses (KW and CIM) highlighted the upper part of linkage group 1 of the apricot "Harlayne" genitor.									21	0	0	16	0	21			1614-2942			WOS:000275976300011

After exposure to pressure, the smooth muscle cells were fixed, stained, and imaged to quantify cell morphology and proliferation. Additionally, Western blotting was used to quantify extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK(1)/(2)) activation as well as phenotype marker proteins, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and SM-22.RESULTS Compared with the control, BSMCs exposed to hydrostatic pressure exhibited a more spread morphology after 4 hours and the expression of activated ERK(1)/(2) was a maximum of two-fold at 1.5-3 hours. Moreover, cell density of BSMCs exposed to hydrostatic pressure exhibited an increase after 48 hours when compared with their respective controls. In contrast, alpha-smooth muscle actin and SM-22 expression was similar in the control and in cells exposed to hydrostatic pressure for 48 hours.CONCLUSIONS The morphologic and proliferative changes of BSMC in response to hydrostatic pressure possibly indicate a phenotypic shift from contractile to synthetic. Moreover, the activation of ERK(1)/(2) intracellular signaling pathway may represent a potential mechanism for the pressure-induced BSMC proliferation. The comparable levels of contractile proteins observed in both control and pressure group BSMCs suggest that not all the phenotype markers are regulated concomitantly by a single stimulus.

J	Malik, Mayank S.; Norsworthy, Jason K.; Riley, Melissa B.; Bridges, William, Jr.								Temperature and Light Requirements for Wild Radish (Raphanus raphanistrum) Germination over a 12-Month Period following Maturation								WEED SCIENCE				58	2			136	140		10.1614/WS-09-109.1			APR-JUN 2010	2010	Knowledge of the germination requirements of wild radish will help in determining the favorable conditions for germination and emergence and allow better management of this weed. Experiments were conducted during 2005 to 2006 and 2006 to 2007 to evaluate wild radish temperature and light requirements over a 12-mo period beginning in July on seeds placed on the soil surface and at a 10-cm depth. Germination response was influenced by temperature, light, duration of burial, and burial depth. Freshly harvested seeds (July) had no more than 18% germination whereas seeds allowed to after-ripen in the field for 3 to 6 mo (October to January) had up to 40% germination. The germination of wild radish retrieved from the soil surface was 1.2 to 1.5 times greater at alternating temperatures (2.5/17.5, 7.5/22.5, and 12.5/27.5 C) than at constant temperatures (10, 15, and 20 C) at 0, 3, and 6 mo after maturation. The light requirement for germination varied by time of year with no differences in germination between light and dark conditions for freshly harvested seeds. Far-red light inhibited germination of wild radish, indicating that wild radish may become sensitive to light following an after-ripening period.									7	0	0	5	1	7			0043-1745			WOS:000277059500008		
J	Heidari, Tahereh; Andrus, Ronald D.								Mapping liquefaction potential of aged soil deposits in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina								ENGINEERING GEOLOGY				112	1-4			1	12		10.1016/j.enggeo.2010.02.001			MAR 26 2010	2010	Liquefaction potential of aged soil deposits in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, based on the 1886 Charleston earthquake is characterized in this paper. The characterization involves reviewing available first-hand accounts of 1886 ground behavior, analyzing cone penetration test (CPT) and shear wave velocity data, and correlating the results with geology. Careful review of the first-hand accounts reveals that nearly all cases of surface effects of liquefaction can be associated with the younger sand deposits that lie adjacent to the harbor, rivers, and creeks. Only one documented case of minimal surface effect of liquefaction can be definitely associated with the older sand deposits of the 100,000-year-old Wando Formation. Ratios of measured-to-estimated shear wave velocity indicate that the younger sand deposits and the older sand deposits have measured velocities that are 9% and 38%, respectively, greater than 6-year-old sand deposits with the same CPT tip resistance. Liquefaction potential is expressed in terms of the liquefaction potential index (LPI) proposed by Iwasaki and others. LPI values for the Wando sands computed from the CPT profiles are incorrectly high, if no age corrections are applied. If age corrections are applied, computed LPI values match well the observed field behavior in both the younger sands and the older sands. The results are combined with a 1:24,000 scale geologic map to produce a liquefaction potential map of Mount Pleasant. The findings of this study agree remarkably well with a previous liquefaction potential study of aged soil deposits on Charleston peninsula. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Addition of cerium rich misch metal to AZ91 alloy resulted in formation of needle shape particles, which had a very high thermal stability, providing superior mechanical properties compared to AZ91 magnesium alloy. As a result, the grain boundaries were less susceptible for grain boundary sliding at high temperatures. The steady state creep rates were specified and for the AZ91 alloy and the results indicate a mixed mode of creep behavior, with some grain boundary effects contributing to the overall behavior. However for the RE added samples, sliding of grain boundaries was greatly suppressed and the dislocation climb controlled creep was the dominant deformation mechanism. Dry sliding wear tests were also performed to investigate the effect of Rare Earth additives on wear response of AZ91 magnesium alloy. Weight loss values were determined and wear mechanisms of the alloys with different amount of REs were investigated. Abrasion, delamination and gross plastic deformation were identified as prevailing wear mechanisms. Abrasive wear that activated at lower loads and sliding speeds increased wear rates for less ductile specimens of Rare Earth enriched. However AZ91 alloy containing Rare Earth contents show superior resistance to gross plastic deformation which operated at more severe wear conditions. This is due to existence of Al11RE3 phase that posses attractive mechanical properties at elevated temperatures. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Total GSL concentrations and individual GSLs were quantified in different plant parts at different developmental stages. Eight GSLs were found in various plant tissues but glucoerucin, glucoraphenin, and glucotropaeolin comprised >90% of the total GSLs. All three are degraded to isothiocyanates, which are associated with weed suppression. Maximum GSL concentration (1942.2 mu mol/plant) occurred at 50% flowering stage prior to the time of maximum biomass production, when GSL concentration was 1246.65 mu mol/plant. Roots contributed <15% of the total GSL. The highest concentration of GSLs was in flowers at flowering stage, but due to the low biomass they contributed only 11.83% to the total GSL. On the basis of these results, wild radish should be incorporated into soil at 50% flowering to provide the most GSLs for weed suppression.									9	1	0	8	0	9			0021-8561			WOS:000275710700011	20163113

The pervasiveness of the streaming instability and its consequences								MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY				403	1			211	228		10.1111/j.1365-2966.2009.16145.x			MAR 21 2010	2010	We present a series of simulations of turbulent stratified protostellar discs with the goal of characterizing the settling of dust throughout a minimum-mass solar nebula. We compare the evolution of both compact spherical grains, as well as highly fractal grains. Our simulations use a shearing-box formulation to study the evolution of dust grains locally within the disc, and collectively our simulations span the entire extent of a typical accretion disc. The dust is stirred by gas that undergoes magnetorotational instability-driven turbulence. The turbulence tends to lift the dust above the disc's mid-plane, while gravity tends to draw it back to the mid-plane. This establishes a steady state scaleheight for the dust that is different for dust of different sizes. This sedimentation of dust is an important first step in planet formation and we predict that the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) should be able to observationally verify its existence.When significant sedimentation occurs, the dust will participate in a streaming instability that significantly enhances the dust density. We show that the streaming instability is pervasive at many of the outer radial stations in a disc. We characterize the scaleheights of dust whose size ranges from a few micrometres all the way up to a few centimetres. We find that for spherical grains, a power-law relationship develops for the scaleheight with grain size, with a slope that is slightly steeper than -1/2. The sedimentation is strongest in the outer disc and increases for large grains. The results presented here show that direct measurements of grain settling can be made by ALMA and we present favourable conditions for observability. The streaming instability should also be directly observable and we provide conditions for directly observing it. We calculate collision rates and growth rates for the dust grains in our simulations of various sizes colliding with other grains, and find that these rates are significantly enhanced through the density enhancement arising from the streaming instability.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0035-8711			WOS:000276351600034

The measured photosensitivity threshold is < 0.1 GW/cm(2), and a photoinduced refractive index increase as large as 0.016 is observed. The photosensitive process is athermal; further, we confirm the absence of two-photon absorption in As2S3, suggesting that defect absorption accounts for the energy transfer from photons to glass network. Besides its potential application for reconfigurable photonics circuit, such photosensitivity is also an important design consideration for nonlinear optical devices using chalcogenide glasses.

J	Adelberg, Jeffrey								Sucrose, water and nutrient use during stage II multiplication of two turmeric clones (Curcuma longa L.) in liquid medium								SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE				124	2			262	267		10.1016/j.scienta.2009.12.027			MAR 15 2010	2010	Two clones of turmeric (Cucruma longa L.) were assessed nine times during a 28-day culture period in double phosphate MS liquid medium containing 2%, 4% and 6% sucrose. The phase of rapid shoot bud multiplication lasted for 21 days or less, in both clones in all media. The maximum multiplication rate was 3.4x at 20 and 19 days, with 3.9% or 4.7% initial sucrose concentration being optimal for the clones 9-3 and 35-1, respectively. Dry mass increased over the entire culture period and was greatest with 4.8% or at least 6% initial sucrose concentration for the two clones, 9-3 and 35-1, respectively. Maximum tissue water mass required 2.8% and 3.9% initial sucrose, respectively, in the two clones. Tissue relative water content (tissue water mass/fresh mass) was better correlated with sucrose concentration in medium, than the osmolality of medium, for both clones at all sucrose concentrations. Relative water content increased over time (water was incorporated more rapidly than dry mass in growing tissue) and sucrose concentration in media decreased over time (sucrose was used at a relatively more rapid rate than water). The concentrations of 10 nutrients (P, K, S, Zn, Mg, Fe, B, Ca, Mn and Cu) and Na assayed in time course all decreased rapidly over time. The rates of nutrient use were better related to growth of plant mass than shoot bud multiplication. P and Cu were completely depleted from medium before the end of the culture period. P concentration in tissues was in the lower ranges of that considered optimal, and Cu was in excess concentrations, based on comparison to high-yielding field-grown plants. Sugar, water, and nutrient use were more closely related to plant mass than shoot multiplication. The stationary phase of bud multiplication was coincident with continued growth of tissue dry and water mass. Among inorganic nutrients, lowered concentrations of P were most likely related to the stationary phase of bud multiplication, but still permissive of dry and water mass increases. Lowered availability of sugar, other inorganic nutrients, or less available water, did not precede day 21 and the end of active shoot bud multiplication. In batch culture, the concentration of a nutrient that is rapidly used (e.g. sucrose) does not remain at an optimal range for a prolonged period of time. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The major objective of this research was to toughen PLA without significant loss in modulus and strength and to introduce reactive acid groups using reactive blending of PLA with a combination of polymers. PLA was reactive blended with poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) followed by physical blending with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) in solution. The modified PLA was extruded into films using a co-rotating twin-screw extruder and characterized using tensile testing, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and dynamic mechanical analyses (DMA). This technology resulted in films with a ten-fold increase in toughness compared to neat PLA with little or no decrease in strength and modulus.[GRPHICS]									15	2	0	0	0	16			1438-7492			WOS:000276482900002

Three different scenarios were found eligible for analysis: (1) conversion to biodiesel, (II) rendering and conversion, and (III) farming, rendering, and conversion. The amounts of energy required in farming, meat processing, and baseline conversion to biodiesel were reviewed front the literature. The thermal energy and electricity Used in rendering were surveyed front the U.S. rendering industry. For animal fats, scenario III resulted in a net energy ratio (NER, ratio of energy outputs to energy inputs) much lower than I. In contrast, the NERs for scenarios I and If were both found to be > 1. For scenario I, the NER was found to be >3.6, larger than the value typically reported for soybean oil (SBO) biodiesel. As for the waste SBO grease, the NER Was found to be > 1 for both applicable scenarios (I and II). To a limited extent, sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate changes in assumptions with respect to the type of fuels employed in the generation of thermal energy as well as the method for biodiesel production.									17	0	0	6	0	17			0888-5885			WOS:000274752700051

HCI-insulator collisions result in high sputter yields and surface nanofeature creation due to strong coupling between the solid's electronic system and lattice. For HCIs interacting with Al oxide, combined experiments and theory indicate that defect mediated desorption can explain reasonably well preferential O atom removal and an observed threshold for sputtering due to potential energy. These studies have relied on measuring mass loss on the target substrate or probing craters left after desorption. Our approach is to extract highly charged ions onto the Al oxide barriers of metal-insulator-metal tunnel junctions and measure the increased conductance in a finished device after the irradiated interface is buried under the top metal layer. Such transport measurements constrain dynamic surface processes and provide large sets of statistics concerning the way individual HCI projectiles dissipate their potential energy. Results for Xe(q+) for q = 32, 40, 44 extracted onto Al oxide films are discussed in terms of postirradiation electrical device characteristics. Future work will elucidate the relationship between potential energy dissipation and tunneling phenomena through HCI modified oxides.					12th International Workshop on Desorption Induced by Electronic Transitions (DIET 12)12th International Workshop on Desorption Induced by Electronic Transitions (DIET 12)	APR 19-23, 2009APR 19-23, 2009	SPECS; HIDEN Analy; BRUKER; United States Natl Sci Fdn; Georgia Inst Technol; States Univ New JerseySPECS; HIDEN Analy; BRUKER; United States Natl Sci Fdn; Georgia Inst Technol; States Univ New Jersey	Pine Mt, GAPine Mt, GA	3	0	0	0	0	3			0953-8984			WOS:000274271800009	21389384

Each tunnel junction consists of an ultrathin film metal-oxide-semiconductor device which can be biased to create a band of hot electrons useful for driving chemical reactions at surfaces. Using the binary collision approximation and a nonadiabatic model that takes into account the time-varying nature of the ion-surface interaction, the energy loss of the ions is reproduced. The energy loss for Na(+) ions incident on the devices shows that the primary energy loss mechanism is the atomic displacement of Au atoms in the thin film of the metal-oxide-semiconductor device. We propose that neutral particle detection of the scattered flux from a biased device could be a route to hot electron mediated charge exchange.					12th International Workshop on Desorption Induced by Electronic Transitions (DIET 12)12th International Workshop on Desorption Induced by Electronic Transitions (DIET 12)	APR 19-23, 2009APR 19-23, 2009	SPECS; HIDEN Analy; BRUKER; United States Natl Sci Fdn; Georgia Inst Technol; States Univ New JerseySPECS; HIDEN Analy; BRUKER; United States Natl Sci Fdn; Georgia Inst Technol; States Univ New Jersey	Pine Mt, GAPine Mt, GA	4	0	0	0	0	4			0953-8984			WOS:000274271800011	21389386

This study sought to evaluate valve surgery compared with medical therapy for NVE and to identify characteristics of patients who are most likely to benefit from early surgery.Methods and Results-Using a prospective, multinational cohort of patients with definite NVE, the effect of early surgery on in-hospital mortality was assessed by propensity-based matching adjustment for survivor bias and by instrumental variable analysis. Patients were stratified by propensity quintile, paravalvular complications, valve perforation, systemic embolization, stroke, Staphylococcus aureus infection, and congestive heart failure. Of the 1552 patients with NVE, 720 (46%) underwent early surgery and 832 (54%) were treated with medical therapy. Compared with medical therapy, early surgery was associated with a significant reduction in mortality in the overall cohort (12.1% [87/720] versus 20.7% [172/832]) and after propensity-based matching and adjustment for survivor bias (absolute risk reduction [ARR]-5.9%, P < 0.001). With a combined instrument, the instrumental-variable-adjusted ARR in mortality associated with early surgery was -11.2% (P < 0.001). In subgroup analysis, surgery was found to confer a survival benefit compared with medical therapy among patients with a higher propensity for surgery (ARR -10.9% for quintiles 4 and 5, P = 0.002) and those with paravalvular complications (ARR -17.3%, P < 0.001), systemic embolization (ARR -12.9%, P = 0.002), S aureus NVE (ARR -20.1%, P < 0.001), and stroke (ARR -13%, P = 0.02) but not those with valve perforation or congestive heart failure.Conclusions-Early surgery for NVE is associated with an in-hospital mortality benefit compared with medical therapy alone.

XPS and ToF-SIMS Investigation of alpha-Helical and beta-Strand Peptide Adsorption onto SAMs								LANGMUIR				26	5			3423	3432		10.1021/la902888y			MAR 2 2010	2010	14-mer alpha-helix and 15-mer beta-strand oligopeptides composed of leucine (L) and lysine (K) were used to investigate peptide adsorption and orientation onto well-defined methyl and carboxylic acid-terminated self-assembled monolayer (SAM) surfaces with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). XPS showed that both peptides reached monolayer thickness oil both SAMs, but significantly higher solution concentrations were required to reach this coverage on the methyl SAMs. This shows that the peptides adsorb more strongly onto the carboxyl-terminated SAMs. The excess oxygen detected by XPS and the H(3)O(+) signal detected by ToF-SIMS for the SAMs with adsorbed peptides indicated that water molecules are associated with the adsorbed peptides, even under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions. Changes in the number of L and K fragments detected by ToF-SIMS indicate that the beta-strand oriented differently on the two SAMs. The L side chains were preferentially associated with the methyl-terminated SAM, and the K side chains were preferentially associated with the carboxyl SAM. In contrast, little change in the ToF-SIMS K/L ratio was observed for the alpha-helix peptide absorbed on the two SAMs, indicating that ToF-SIMs was not as sensitive to the orientation of the alpha-helix peptide.									28	1	0	9	0	29			0743-7463			WOS:000274636900068	19891457

Mesh Colors								ACM TRANSACTIONS ON GRAPHICS				29	2					15	10.1145/1731047.1731053			MAR 2010	2010	The coloring of 3D models using 2D or 3D texture mapping has well-known intrinsic problems, such as mapping discontinuities and limitations to model editing after coloring. Workarounds for these problems often require adopting very complex approaches. Here we propose a new technique, called mesh colors, for associating color data directly with a polygonal mesh. The approach eliminates problems deriving from using a map from texture space to model space. Mesh colors is an extension of vertex colors where, in addition to keeping color values on each vertex, they are also kept on edges and faces. Like texture mapping, the approach allows higher texture resolution than model resolution, but at the same time it guarantees one-to-one correspondence between the model surface and the color data, and eliminates discontinuities. We show that mesh colors integrate well with the current graphics pipeline and can be used to generate very high-quality textures.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0730-0301	1557-7368		WOS:000276844800006

The proposed method consists of two single one-way encryption processes. In the first process, the digital information is divided to several data blocks with 512-bit each. The data blocks are encoded to 8 by 8 sub-images with 256 gray scales, creating information planes. Then take a nonlinear cascaded Fourier transform of sub-image to generate a data matrix through an optical/digital hybrid system. By extending the data matrix we get four information planes. Again, taking nonlinear cascaded Fourier transform to built information planes, we get a Hash value 64-bit long (hash(1)). In the second process, we shift cydically every numerical value of the original information planes by 4-bit, constructing auxiliary information planes. Thereafter we take the same operations as we have done in the first process to the Hash value (hash(2)). Once hash(1) and hash(2) obtained, they are combined to form a final Hash value 128-bit long (hash). Furthermore, the avalanche effect coefficient (AEC) was also proposed to evaluate the performance of the optical Hash function. Theoretical analysis and simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of optical Hash function constructed by our approach and the constructed optical Hash function has good performance of avalanche effect and collision resistance.									1	1	0	0	0	1			1000-3290			WOS:000276004500052

So too have isolation, alienation, mistrust, and boredom, with the result that ongoing social support has been diminishing, particularly for young people. These trends constitute a national public health crisis affecting young people in general, those already defined as having mental health problems, and their families. To respond adequately, the child mental health system must change dramatically-away from the provision of units of service defined by protocols, time, and professionals' presence and toward the engagement of primary community institutions in the creation and maintenance of new norms of giving and receiving help. Initial evidence suggests that such a shift requires massive effort but that it is feasible and potentially effective.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0894-587X	1573-3289		WOS:000278110200025	20162379

A model is introduced that has an unknown number of changepoints and allows for series autocorrelations, periodic dynamics, and a mean shift at each changepoint time. An objective function gauging the number of changepoints and their locations, based on a minimum description length (MDL) information criterion, is derived. A genetic algorithm is then developed to optimize the objective function. The methods are applied in the analysis of a century of monthly temperatures from Tuscaloosa, Alabama.									24	0	0	4	0	24			1932-6157			WOS:000283528300013

This method requires depositing and assembling building blocks (cell-laden microgels) at high throughput. The current technologies (e.g., molding and photolithography) to fabricate microgels have throughput challenges and provide limited control over building block properties (e.g., cell density). The cell-encapsulating droplet generation technique has potential to address these challenges. In this study, we monitored individual building blocks for viability, proliferation and cell density. The results showed that (i) SMCs can be encapsulated in collagen droplets with high viability (> 94.2 +/- 3.2%) for four cases of initial number of cells per building block (i.e. 7 +/- 2, 16 +/- 2, 26 +/- 3 and 37 +/- 3 cells/building block). (ii) Encapsulated SMCs can proliferate in building blocks at rates that are consistent (1.49 +/- 0.29) across all four cases, compared to that of the controls. (iii) By assembling these building blocks, we created an SMC patch (5 mm x 5 mm x 20 mu m), which was cultured for 51 days forming a 3D tissue-like construct. The histology of the cultured patch was compared to that of a native rat bladder. These results indicate the potential of creating 3D tissue models at high throughput in vitro using building blocks.									41	1	0	31	1	42			1758-5082			WOS:000278118400006	20811120

Sapflow and water use of freshwater wetland trees exposed to saltwater incursion in a tidally influenced South Carolina watershed								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE				40	3			525	535		10.1139/X09-204			MAR 2010	2010	Sea-level rise and anthropogenic activity promote salinity incursion into many tidal freshwater forested wetlands. Interestingly, individual trees can persist for decades after salt impact. To understand why, we documented sapflow (J(s)), reduction in J(s) with sapwood depth, and water use (F) of baldcypress (Tavodium distichum (L.) Rich.) trees undergoing exposure to salinity. The mean J(s) of individual trees was reduced by 2.8 g H(2)O.m(-2).s(-1) (or by 18%) in the outer sapwood on a saline site versus a freshwater site; however, the smallest trees, present only on the saline site, also registered the lowest J(s). Hence, tree size significantly influenced the overall site effect on J(s). Trees undergoing perennial exposure to salt used greater relative amounts of water in outer sapwood than in inner sapwood depths, which identifies a potentially different strategy for baldcypress trees coping with saline site conditions over decades. Overall, individual trees used 100 kg H(2)O.day(-1) on a site that remained relatively fresh versus 23.9 kg H(2)O.day(-1) on the saline site. We surmise that perennial salinization of coastal freshwater forests forces shifts in individual-tree osmotic balance and water-use strategy to extend survival time on suboptimal sites, which further influences growth and morphology.									17	0	0	15	0	17			0045-5067			WOS:000276484600011

In this study, an adenoviral gene delivery system was used to deliver this fusion protein. Our data indicate that adenoviral vector can efficiently deliver the MULT1E/FasTI fusion protein into TC-1 cells both in vitro and in vivo as assayed by RT-PCR, FACS analysis, caspase-3 activity and decreased in vivo tumor growth. This study further confirms that MULTE/FasTI represents a powerful bi-functional, therapeutic protein for the treatment of cancers.

The combined results of X-ray powder diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy show that the MWCNTs largely retain their orientation and individual tubular morphology in the aligned MWCNT bulk samples, and that the SPS process induces inter- and intra-tubular bonding as well as graphene formation. In view of the one-dimensional nature of individual MWCNTs, it is particularly noteworthy that the transverse electrical resistivity rho(T) is slightly lower than the longitudinal resistivity rho(L), whereas the transverse thermal conductivity kappa(T) is similar to 50% Of kappa(L). The room temperature kappa(L) is similar to 31 W/(m K), one of the highest reported in MWCNT bulk samples. In addition, the thermopower measurements show anisotropy and features of phonon drag.

This study investigated the formation and occurrence of HNMs under different disinfection scenarios and the presence of their precursors in municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTPs) effluents. Formation potential tests performed on WWTP effluents revealed that HNM formation occurred in the order of ozonation-chlorination >> ozonation-chloramination > chlorination > chloramination. Ozonation alone did not produce any HNM. Municipal WWTP effluents contained some reactive HNM precursors, possibly the by-products of biological treatment processes and/or some moiety of industry or household origin. No effects of nitrate on the formation of HNMs were observed in this study, and nitrification in WWTPs appears to remove appreciable portion of HNM precursors, especially those reactive to chlorine. UV disinfection using low pressure lamps in municipal WWTPs had negligible impact on HNM formation potential. HNM concentrations in the effluents of selected WWTPs were either non-detectable or less than minimum reporting level, except for one WWTP that gave trichloronitromethane concentrations in the range of 0.9-1.5 mu g L(-1). No HNMs were observed in the effluents disinfected with UV radiation. Therefore, it appears the typical wastewater disinfection processes involving chlorination or UV treatment in WWTPs do not produce significant amounts of HNMs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Lohou, Christophe								Detection of the non-topology preservation of Ma and Sonka's algorithm, by the use of P-simple points								COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING				114	3			384	399		10.1016/j.cviu.2009.10.003			MAR 2010	2010	In 1996, Ma and Sonka proposed a thinning algorithm which yields curve skeletons for 3D binary images [C. Ma, M. Sonka, A fully parallel 3D thinning algorithm and its applications, Comput. Vis. Image Underst. 64 (3) (1996) 420-433]. This algorithm is one of the most referred thinning algorithms in the context of digital topology: either by its use in medical applications or for comparisons with other thinning algorithms.In 2007, Wang and Basu [T. Wang, A. Basu, A note on 'a fully parallel 3D thinning algorithm and its applications', Pattern Recognit. Lett. 28 (4) (2007) 501-506] wrote a paper in which they claim that Ma and Sonka's 3D thinning algorithm does not preserve topology. As they highlight in their paper, a counter-example was given in 2001, in Lohou's thesis [C. Lohou, Contribution a l'analyse topologiclue des images: etude d'algorithmes de squelettisation pour images 2D et 3D selon une approche topologie digitale ou topologie discrete. Ph.D. thesis, University of Marne-la-Vallee, France, 2001].In this paper, it is shown how P-simple points have guided the author towards a proof that Ma and Sonka's algorithm does not always preserve topology. Moreover, the reasoning being very general, it could be reused for such a purpose, i.e., to simplify the proof on the non-topology preservation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS				20	2			398	418		10.1890/09-0397.1			MAR 2010	2010	Migratory bird needs must be met during four phases of the year: breeding season, fall migration, wintering, and spring migration; thus, management may be needed during all four phases. The bulk of research and management has focused on the breeding season, although several issues remain unsettled, including the spatial extent of habitat influences on fitness and the importance of habitat on the breeding grounds used after breeding. Although detailed investigations have shed light on the ecology and population dynamics of a few avian species, knowledge is sketchy for most species. Replication of comprehensive studies is needed for multiple species across a range of areas.Information deficiencies are even greater during the wintering season, when birds require sites that provide security and food resources needed for survival and developing nutrient reserves for spring migration and, possibly, reproduction. Research is needed on many species simply to identify geographic distributions, wintering sites, habitat use, and basic ecology. Studies are complicated, however, by the mobility of birds and by sexual segregation during winter. Stable-isotope methodology has offered an opportunity to identify linkages between breeding and wintering sites, which facilitates understanding the complete annual cycle of birds.The twice-annual migrations are the poorest-understood events in a bird's life. Migration has always been a risky undertaking, with such anthropogenic features as tall buildings, towers, and wind generators adding to the risk. Species such as woodland specialists migrating through eastern North America have numerous options for pausing during migration to replenish nutrients, but some species depend on limited stopover locations. Research needs for migration include identifying pathways and timetables of migration, quality and distribution of habitats, threats posed by towers and other tall structures, and any bottlenecks for migration.Issues such as human population growth, acid deposition, climate change, and exotic diseases arc global concerns with uncertain consequences to migratory birds and even less-certain remedies. Despite enormous gaps in our understanding of these birds, research, much of it occurring in the past 30 years, has provided sufficient information to make intelligent conservation efforts but needs to expand to handle future challenges.									115	1	0	111	1	120			1051-0761	1939-5582		WOS:000276635600007	20405795

This paper shows that rate of change of frequency can be utilized to determine the magnitude of generation-load imbalance, while the rate of change of voltage with respect to active power can be utilized to identify the sensitive bus for load shedding. The frequency, voltages and their rate of change can be obtained by means of measurements in real-time from various devices such as digital recorders or phasor measurement units or these parameters can be estimated from the voltage data by other means such as an optimal estimation method like Kalman filtering The rate of change of system frequency, along with the equivalent system inertia may be used to estimate the magnitude of the disturbance prior to each load shedding step The buses with a higher rate of change of voltage may be identified as the critical ones for load shedding and load can be first shed at these buses, depending oil the change in the power flow at each bus This application is tested oil the IEEE 30 bus system and the preliminary results demonstrate that it is feasible to be used in load shedding to restore system voltage and frequency (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Pt particles on the MC support were slightly larger than those on commercial samples of Pt on carbon black, and they showed a greater tendency to agglomerate on the MC support than on carbon black. Ex situ cyclic voltammetry gave values for electrochemically active surface area that were about half that for a commercial Pt-on-carbon black sample. Preliminary attempts to prepare thin-film electrodes from Pt/MC samples with a Nafion binder using conventional ink formulations failed, probably because much of the Nafion electrolyte was taken up inside support pores and was not available to bind the support particles together. An alternate approach involving painting of catalyst inks directly onto gas diffusion layers was used to prepare membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) from Pt/MC samples, which were tested using single-cell test hardware. Performance of these Pt/MC sample MEAs was compared with that prepared by decal transfer method with commercially obtained Vulcan XC-72R supported Pt catalyst. The reasons for the lower performance of Pt/MC were discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									19	2	0	1	0	21			0013-4686			WOS:000275985700018		
J	Rivlin, Elizabeth								Forms of Service in Thomas Deloney'sThe Gentle Craft								ENGLISH LITERARY RENAISSANCE				40	2			191	214					SPR 2010	2010	This essay relates changing forms of early modern service to the emerging form of prose fiction in Thomas Deloney's The Gentle Craft (1597-1598). Recent scholarly work has emphasized that representations of service registered important changes in the socio-economic structures of early modern England, but it has failed to link these material developments to aesthetic concerns. The Gentle Craft represents adaptable, mixed service practices as a model for the innovative aesthetics and generic hybridity of prose fiction. Deloney's narrative, which traces both the reinvigoration of the nobility through shoemaking and the dramatic upward mobility of the common shoemaker, paradoxically redefines service as an aspirational, capitalist occupation and as a deferential, respectful profession. In negotiating these seemingly contradictory positions, the text enacts the role of the flexible servant and demonstrates how early modern service was inflecting concepts of authorship and literary form.

The "Blurring" of Special Education in a New Continuum of General Education Placements and Services								EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN				76	3	SI		301	323					SPR 2010	2010	For nearly 10 years, the response-to-intervention (RTI) policy initiative has engendered enthusiasm at federal state, and local levels and among various stakeholders. Nevertheless, there are basic and important disagreements about its nature and purpose. The authors describe two groups with contrasting perspectives on RTI in an effort to examine its multiple meanings, to argue that neither group has a credible plan to educate children and youth with severe learning needs, and to encourage all interested parties to think productively about what they want to accomplish in the name of RTI.									88	0	0	0	0	88			0014-4029			WOS:000275829300004		
J	Wang, G. Geoff; Kemball, Kevin J.								Effects of fire severity on early survival and growth of planted jack pine, black spruce and white spruce								FORESTRY CHRONICLE				86	2			193	199					MAR-APR 2010	2010	Two boreal mixedwood stands burned by the 1999 Black River wildfire in southeastern Manitoba, Canada were selected to study the effect of fire severity on early survival and growth of planted jack pine (Pinus banksiana), black spruce (Picea mariana) and white spruce (Picea glauca) seedlings. In each stand, three fire severity classes (scorched, lightly burned, and severely burned) were identified based on the degree of forest floor consumption. Fire severity was not a significant factor on mortality. No mortality difference was found among species, except for year 5 when jack pine had significantly higher mortality than both black spruce and white spruce. Jack pine and black spruce had their highest mortality in year 4, while white spruce had its highest mortality in year 1. Under natural competition, seedling growth increased with increasing fire severity. When competition was removed, fire severity did not affect seedling growth. Regardless of fire severity and competition, jack pine had better diameter and height growth than black spruce, which, in turn, grew slightly taller than white spruce. Planted seedlings faced less intense vegetation competition on severely burned plots compared to scorched or lightly burned plots. Regardless of fire severity and species, competition increased with time since planting. Our study results indicate that planting immediately after a wildfire is a viable option to establish conifer components on burned boreal mixedwood stands.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0015-7546			WOS:000277299300013

Examining the Compatibility between Forestry Incentive Programs in the US and the Practice of Sustainable Forest Management								FORESTS				1	1			49	64		10.3390/f1010049			MAR 2010	2010	This research explores the intersection between the various federal and state forestry incentive programs and the adoption of sustainable forestry practices on non-industrial private forest (NIPF) lands in the US. The qualitative research reported here draws upon a series of eight focus groups of NIPF landowners (two each in Minnesota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina). Despite minor regional variations, the dominant theme that emerged is that these landowners' purchase and management decisions are motivated by the "trilogy" of forest continuity, benefit to the owner, and doing the "right thing." This trilogy is quite consistent with notions of sustainable forestry, but somewhat more at odds with the objectives of many financial incentive programs, as well as specific tactics such as third-party certification. A series of policy recommendations that emerge from this research is presented.									4	0	0	3	0	4			1999-4907			WOS:000208656600004		
J	Eggert, Lisa M. F.; Jodice, Patrick G. R.; O'Reilly, Kathleen M.								Stress response of brown pelican nestlings to ectoparasite infestation								GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY				166	1			33	38		10.1016/j.ygcen.2009.08.009			MAR 1 2010	2010	Measurement of corticosterone has become a useful tool for assessing the response of individuals to ecological stressors of interest. Enhanced corticosterone levels can promote survival of stressful events; however, in situations where a stressor persists and corticosterone levels remain elevated, the adrenocortical response can be detrimental. A potential ecological stressor for wild birds is parasitism by ectoparasites. We studied the stress response of 11-23-day-old brown pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis) nestlings by measuring plasma corticosterone levels in relation to the presence of the soft tick Carlos capensis at two colonies in South Carolina in 2005. We expected to see higher baseline and stress-induced levels of corticosterone for parasitized chicks compared to those nestlings with no ticks. Although nestlings mounted a response to capture stress, tick category was not associated with corticosterone levels at either colony. Our results appear to contrast those of previous studies and indicate that the adrenocortical response of the host is likely dependent on the type of ectoparasite and the degree of infestation.

J	Fink, Nicole; Pak, Richard; Battisto, Dina				Davis, Mark/J-5101-2015; 	Pak, Richard/0000-0001-9145-6991			Developing a Usability Evaluation Tool To Assess the Patient Room Bathroom								HERD-HEALTH ENVIRONMENTS RESEARCH & DESIGN JOURNAL				3	3			22	41					SPR 2010	2010	Objective: The goal of this project was to create an easy-to-administer and inexpensive tool that can help identify usability issues in a patient room bathroom during the design process so improvements can be made before the final product is constructed and put into operation.Background: The bathroom is an essential part of any hospital patient room, yet it is associated with nurse dissatisfaction and patient falls. Minimal literature has examined whether the physical structure of various elements within the bathroom are efficient, safe, and satisfactory for the majority of users. Furthermore, there is a paucity of human factor guidelines for architects and designers to follow to ensure the usability of bathroom space for a wide variety of users.Methods: The authors adapted a common technique used in software usability: the heuristic evaluation. A heuristic evaluation is a "discount'' evaluation method used to quickly and efficiently evaluate the usability flaws of user interfaces. Three methods were used to provide input for the heuristic evaluation: (1) Review of existing heuristic evaluations, reported hospital bathroom problems, and safety checklists; (2) Interviews with nurses and nursing assistants; and (3) Focus groups with nurses. Analysis of the interview and focus group transcripts enabled the categorization of the types of problems nurses encounter in the patient room bathroom. These categories served as the basis for the heuristics in the heuristic evaluation tool.Results: Eleven major heuristics (or categories of problems in the bathroom) were identified initially. The authors then went through several iterations of designing and refining the heuristic evaluation to form parsimonious categories and subcategories. Each of the eventual six major heuristic categories contains a general description as well as specific exemplar questions. These detailed subcategories enable an evaluator to easily gauge whether a bathroom adheres to the guideline, to write any comments about a particular issue, and to rate the severity of any problems.Conclusions: The bathroom heuristic evaluation was designed to be a discount usability evaluation tool. It can be used to assess a hospital bathroom during the design process for major usability issues, enabling necessary alterations before a final product is developed.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1937-5867			WOS:000278599400005	21165859	
J	Vincent, Ellen; Battisto, Dina; Grimes, Larry; McCubbin, James								The Effects of Nature Images on Pain in a Simulated Hospital Patient Room								HERD-HEALTH ENVIRONMENTS RESEARCH & DESIGN JOURNAL				3	3			42	55					SPR 2010	2010	Background: Views of nature have been reported to relieve stress and pain, making nature an ideal medium for use in healthcare settings. In hospitals whose design does not allow for a view of nature, virtual and surrogate views of nature may be viable therapeutic options.Objective: This study tests the effects of specific nature images, as defined by Appleton's prospect refuge theory of, landscape preference, on participants experiencing pain. The hypotheses were: (1) Nature views are variable in their impact on specific psychological and physiological health status indicators; and (2) Prospect and refuge nature scenes are more therapeutic than hazard nature scenes. The research question was (1) Which nature image categories are most therapeutic as evidenced by reduced pain and positive mood?Methods: An experiment using mixed methods assessed the effects of four different nature scenes on physiological (blood pressure, heart rate) and psychological (mood) responses when a person was subjected to a pain stressor. Four groups were subjected to a specific nature image category of prospect, refuge, hazard, or mixed prospect and refuge; the fifth group viewed no image. The Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire and the Profile of Mood States survey instruments were used to assess pain and mood, respectively. Continuous physiological readings of heart rate and blood pressure were collected. Pain was induced through a cold pressor task, which required participants to immerse their nondominant hand in ice water for up to 120 seconds.Results: The mixed prospect and refuge image treatment showed significantly lower sensory pain responses, and the no-image treatment indicated significantly higher affective pain perception responses. The hazard image treatment had significantly lower diastolic blood pressure readings during the pain treatment, but it also had significantly high total mood disturbance.Conclusions: Although there was no clear "most" therapeutic image, the mixed prospect and refuge image showed significant potential to reduce sensory pain. The hazard image was the most effective at distracting participants from pain, but it should not be considered a positive distraction because it also received the highest mood disturbance scores of all groups.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1937-5867			WOS:000278599400006	21165860	
J	Vincent, Ellen; Battisto, Dina; Grimes, Larry								The Effects of Presence and Influence in Nature Images in a Simulated Hospital Patient Room								HERD-HEALTH ENVIRONMENTS RESEARCH & DESIGN JOURNAL				3	3			56	69					SPR 2010	2010	Background: Nature images are frequently used for therapeutic purposes in hospital settings. Nature images may distract people from pain and promote psychological and physiological well-being, yet limited research is available to guide the selection process of nature images.Objective: The hypothesis is that higher degrees of presence and/or influence in the still photograph make it more effective at holding the viewer's attention, which therefore may distract the viewer from pain, and therefore be considered therapeutic. Research questions include: (1) Is there a significant difference in the level of perceived presence among the selected images? (2) Is there a significant difference in the level of perceived influence among the selected images? (3) Is there a correlation between levels of presence and levels of influence?Methods: 109 college students were randomly assigned to one of four different image categories defined by Appleton's prospect refuge theory of landscape preference. Categories included prospect, refuge, hazard, and mixed prospect and refuge. A control group was also included. Each investigation was divided into five periods: prereporting, rest, a pain stressor (hand in ice water for up to 120 seconds), recovery, and postreporting. Physiological readings (vital signs) were measured repeatedly using a Dinamap automatic vital sign tracking machine. Psychological responses (mood) to the image were collected using a reliable instrument, the Profile of Mood States.Results: No significant statistical difference in levels of presence was found among the four image categories. However, levels of influence differed and the hazard nature image category had significantly higher influence ratings and lower diastolic blood pressure readings during the pain treatment. A correlation (r=.62) between presence and influence was identified; as one rose, so did the other. Mood state was significantly low for the hazard nature image after the pain stressor experience.Conclusions: Though the hazard image caused distraction from pain, it is nontherapeutic because of the low mood ratings it received. These preliminary findings contribute methodology to the research field and stimulate interest for additional research into the visual effects of nature images on pain.									3	1	0	0	0	4			1937-5867			WOS:000278599400007	21165861

Today, with wider deployment of vehicle telematic technologies, prediction of future driving conditions, e. g., road grade, is becoming more realistic. This paper evaluates the potential gain in fuel economy if road grade information is integrated into the energy management of hybrid vehicles. Real-world road geometry information is utilized in power-management decisions by using both dynamic programming (DP) and a standard equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS). At the same time, two baseline control strategies with no future information are developed and validated for comparison purposes. Simulation results show that road terrain preview enables fuel savings. The level of improvement depends on the cruising speed, control strategy, road profile, and the size of the battery.									45	4	0	1	0	49			0018-9545			WOS:000275659600010

However, people should not share their personal information online. We produced and tested a model of information disclosure. While prior work focused on the effects of trust and its relationship to risk in determining intent to disclose information, we assumed that information relevance was a critical antecedent to disclosure and that both relevance and trust could alleviate perceptions of risk associated with disclosure, thereby increasing peoples' intentions to disclose information. We tested our model using 264 subjects in an experimental setting. The results showed the importance of relevance on intentions to disclose information - allowing us to draw implications for practice about voluntary information disclosure in online settings.

Exploitation of the material's compositional flexibility, combined with the ability to tailor all aspects of its size, shape, and physical properties as well as its behavior when exposed to all forms of electromagnetic radiation, has led to numerous breakthroughs. Thus, for the purposes of this review, we have divided the discussion to highlight issues of material composition and form and how both impact device function, focusing on the advances made within the past decades.									35	0	0	1	0	35			2041-1286			WOS:000208520600008

I argue that impending radical changes in global climate will likely precipitate significant changes in the dominate world culture of consumerism and then consider how these changes could alter the moral landscape, particularly culturally thick conceptions of the environmental virtues. According to Jonathan Lear, as the last principal chief of the Crow Nation, Plenty Coups exhibited the virtue of "radical hope," a novel form of courage appropriate to a culture in crisis. I explore what radical hope may look like today, arguing how it should broadly affect our environmental character and that a framework for future environmental virtues will involve a diminished place for valuing naturalness as autonomy from human interference.									8	0	0	2	0	8			1187-7863			WOS:000272848400005

ECH blends, with potential for neuronal prosthetic devices, implantable biosensors, and electro-stimulated release devices, were produced on surface functionalized microfabricated and planar gold electrodes. Hydrogels were synthesized from hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), poly(ethylene glycol) monomethacrylate (PEGMA), N-[tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl]-acrylamide (HMMA), and 3-sulfopropyl methacrylate potassium salt (SPMA) to produce p(HEMA-co-PEGMA-co-HMMA-co-SPMA). The electroconductive polymer component was electropolymerized from pyrrole and 4-(3'-pyrrolyl)butyric acid to form P(Py-co-PyBA) within the electrode-supported hydrogel. The dynamic electrochemical properties of Au*vertical bar Gel-P(Py-co-PyBA) were investigated using multiple scan rate cyclic voltammetry and electrical/electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) over the range 0.1-100 kHz and compared to Au*, Au*vertical bar Gel, and Au*vertical bar PPy. At 0.1 Hz, there was a three-fold decrease in the magnitude of the absolute impedance, subsequent to electropolymerization. The in vitro biocompatibility and cytotoxicity of the polymer-modified gold surfaces were investigated using murine pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells and human muscle fibroblasts (RMS13). For Au*vertical bar Gel-P(Py-co-PyBA) polymer films prepared with different electropolymerization times of 5, 25, and 50 s, there was an increase in cell proliferation of 49%, 61%, and 6% compared to initial cell seeding. These ECH blends have the desired characteristics of low interfacial impedance and noncytotoxicity that makes them good candidates for in vivo intramuscular and neural studies.									19	0	0	9	0	19			0883-9115			WOS:000274532200001

In compatible interactions, virulent RWA populations flourish and susceptible plants suffer extensive leaf chlorophyll loss. In incompatible interactions, RWA reproduction and population growth are significantly reduced and RWA-related chlorophyll loss in resistant plants is minor. The objectives of this study were to develop an understanding of the molecular and phytochemical bases of RWA resistance in plants containing the Dnx resistance gene. Microarray, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and phytohormone assays were conducted to identify transcriptome components unique to RWA-infested Dnx plants and susceptible (Dn0) plants, and to identify and characterize putative genes involved in Dnx plant defense responses. We found that RWA-infested Dnx plants upregulated > 180 genes related to reactive oxygen species, signaling, pathogen defense, and arthropod allelochemical and physical defense. The expression of several of these genes in RWA-infested Dnx plants increased significantly from 6- to 24-h post infestation (hpi), but their expression in Dn0 plants, when present, was delayed until 48- to 96 hpi. Concentrations of 16- and 18-carbon fatty acids, trans-methyl-12-oxophytodienoic acid, and abscisic acid were significantly greater in Dnx foliage than in Dn0 foliage after RWA infestation, suggesting that Dnx RWA defense and resistance genes may be regulated via the oxylipin pathway. These findings provide a foundation for the elucidation of the molecular basis for compatible- and incompatible plant-aphid interactions.									31	5	1	33	0	37			0098-0331			WOS:000275539800003	20229216

XRD patterns of the adsorbents indicated that the modified activated carbon fiber (MACF) was a simple mixture of the raw activated carbon fiber (RACF) and magnetite. After modification, a porous film was formed on the Surface of the MACIF with nano-sized magnetite on it. The As(V) uptake on the MACF was highly pH dependent and was facilitated in acidic Solutions. XPS studies demonstrated that the surface oxygen-containing functional groups were involved in the adsorption and that magnetite played a key role in As(V) uptake. The dominance of HAsO(4)(2-) in Surface complexes and the pH effect on As(V) uptake demonstrated that the monoprotonated bidentate complexes were dominant on the Surface of the MACF. NO reduction of As(V) was observed on the Surface of the ACFs. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.									39	2	0	13	0	40			0021-9797			WOS:000274548900033	20018292

Teachers recruited two cohorts Of sixth grade students, recognized as being aggressive and influential with their peers, and their families into a voluntary, 15-session weekly program. Among the 643 families that, consented (66%), the mean number of sessions attended was 8.13, with almost half (48.3%) attending 11 or more sessions. Linear mixed models (LMMs) were developed to predict the number of sessions attended based on a cluster of demographic variables and scales designed to measure aggression, problem behaviors, family factors, and other psychosocial constructs. Three of the nine clusters held significance when associated with attendance: level of aggression as rated by the child (negative association), parent-child bond (negative association), and level of child victimization. (positive association). Somewhat surprisingly, the variance component due to interventionist turned out to be small and to constitute a nonsignificant component of the overall variability in attendance. Results suggest that family recruitment for multiple family group programs can be achieved with substantial effort and that resources available for recruitment might be differentially applied across families based on predictors of attendance.

The authors argue that employees from societies that are less inclined to accept that power differences exist as a result of structure (low power distance countries, e.g., Australia) will respond to workplace bullying more negatively than will employees from cultures that accept that power differences exist as a result of structure (high power distance, e.g., Singapore). In all, 165 Singaporean and 152 Australian employees completed surveys designed to assess workplace bullying, workgroup identification, and job satisfaction. Results showed that workplace bullying was negatively related to both workgroup identification and job satisfaction among employees from both countries. Moreover, national culture influenced the relationship between bullying and job satisfaction and workgroup identification such that the negative relationships between bullying and these attitudinal outcomes were stronger for Australians than Singaporeans.									24	0	0	1	0	24			0022-0221	1552-5422		WOS:000274275500007		
J	Jenkins, T. C.								Technical note: Common analytical errors yielding inaccurate results during analysis of fatty acids in feed and digesta samples								JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE				93	3			1170	1174		10.3168/jds.2009-2509			MAR 2010	2010	The basic rules governing the proper fatty acid analysis of feed and digesta samples are sometimes overlooked, leading to potential errors in reporting the fatty acid content or composition of feed and digesta samples. The direct transesterification procedure of Sukhija and Palmquist (1988, J. Agric. Food Chem. 36: 1202-1206) has become popular in analyzing fatty acids in feed and digesta samples obtained from animal feeding trials. One shortcoming of the Sukhija and Palmquist transesterification procedure is inaccurate analysis of fatty acids with conjugated double bonds. Digesta and milk samples from ruminant species typically contain a multitude of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomers that easily undergo isomerization and epimerization following prolonged exposure to methanolic HCl. Modifications to the Sukhija and Palmquist procedure are given in this paper that allow successful determination of CLA isomers. Errors in fatty acid analysis also occur from misuse of internal standards; use of an internal standard is recommended in the Sukhija and Palmquist procedure as the preferred method to quantify total fatty acid content. The choice of internal standard may sometimes be important for obtaining accurate results. As an example, applying the direct transesterification procedure to a fat supplement high in saturated fatty acids yielded 613 mg/g of total fatty acids when C17 was used as the internal standard compared with 930 mg/g total fatty acids when C19 was used as the internal standard. Fatty acid content further increased to 952 mg/g when a unique unsaturated fatty acid (C13:1) was used as the internal standard.									38	0	0	35	0	39			0022-0302			WOS:000275056100035	20172237

Evaluation of Transverse Shear Effect on Film Delamination in Blister Test								JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC PACKAGING				132	1					014501	10.1115/1.4000717			MAR 2010	2010	The transverse shear effect has been frequently ignored in determining the debonding-related energy release rate and the phase angle in the blister test, resulting in underestimated values. This study aims to study the effect of shear force on the energy release rate and phase angle prediction in the blister test. A generalized approach is proposed to predict them under the effect of shear force. The predictions show that when the ratio of the film thickness to the debonded film window radius is large (such as 0.05), the transverse shear effect cannot be ignored in determining the energy release rate and the phase angle. The study also further illustrates the importance of including the shear force contribution in estimation and how this importance depends on the film thickness to debonded radius ratio, as well as the elastic mismatch.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1043-7398			WOS:000275825100008

By designing these clouds to be autonomically self-provisioned and adaptable to changing user demands, user-transparent resource flexibility can be achieved without substantially affecting average job sojourn time. In addition, the overlay environment and physical Grid sites represent disjoint administrative and policy domains, permitting cloud systems to be deployed non-disruptively on an existing production Grid. Private overlay clouds administered by, and dedicated to the exclusive use of, individual Virtual Organizations are termed Virtual Organization Clusters. A prototype autonomic cloud adaptation mechanism for Virtual Organization Clusters demonstrates the feasibility of overlay scheduling in dynamically changing environments. Commodity Grid resources are autonomically leased in response to changing private scheduler loads, resulting in the creation of virtual private compute nodes. These nodes join a decentralized private overlay network system called IPOP (IP Over P2P), enabling the scheduling and execution of end user jobs in the private environment. Negligible overhead results from the addition of the overlay, although the use of virtualization technologies at the compute nodes adds modest service time overhead (under 10%) to computationally-bound Grid jobs. By leasing additional Grid resources, a substantial decrease (over 90%) in average job queuing time occurs, offsetting the service time overhead.									10	1	0	0	0	11			1570-7873			WOS:000274656200001		
J	Childers, Ashley Kay; Taaffe, Kevin M.								Healthcare Facility Evacuations: Lessons Learned, Research Activity, and the Need for Engineering Contributions								JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE ENGINEERING				1	1			125	140		10.1260/2040-2295.1.1.125			MAR 2010	2010	Over the past few years, there has been an increase in research related to a healthcare facility's role during a disaster. Most of this literature relates to emergencies where the facility is a resource to the affected population, and the facility must make decisions associated with sudden, increased patient demands. Some emergencies, however, may affect the facility's ability to function and may therefore force the need for a complete patient evacuation. This paper provides an overview of the available literature including lessons learned from actual healthcare facility evacuations and research focusing on making improvements. The purpose is to summarize a variety of healthcare evacuation issues and highlight the research in this area. We raise questions for further research and conclude with an example of using engineering techniques to improve healthcare facility evacuations by prioritizing patients for transport.									5	0	0	0	0	5			2040-2295			WOS:000208547400008

J	Thomas, Charles J.								INFORMATION REVELATION AND BUYER PROFITS IN REPEATED PROCUREMENT COMPETITION								JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECONOMICS				58	1			79	105					MAR 2010	2010	I investigate how procurement costs are affected by the information that buyers reveal about sellers' behavior, in a setting with two sequentially offered contracts for which a seller's privately known costs are identical. Expected prices are lowest when sellers learn nothing until all contracts are allocated, are higher when they learn all sellers' price offers as contracts are allocated, and typically are even higher when they learn only the winner's identity, or the winner's identity and price offer. The results suggest that buyers engaged in repeated procurement may pay less by revealing minimal or extensive information, rather than an intermediate amount.									4	1	0	0	0	5			0022-1821			WOS:000275099300004

We report the details of manufacturing processes used to realize novel high-index-contrast, compact micro-disk resonators. Our findings demonstrate that our device can operate in dual modalities, for detection of the infrared optical absorption of a binding event using cavity enhanced spectroscopy, or sensing refractive index change due to surface molecular binding and extracting microstructural evolution information via cavity enhanced refractometry.									25	2	0	1	0	27			0218-8635	1793-6624		WOS:000278011600005

Most of the algorithms for the segmentation of the common carotid artery (CCA) wall require human interaction to locate the vessel in the ultrasound image. The aim of this article is to show an accurate algorithm for the computer-based automated tracing of the CCA in longitudinal B-mode ultrasound images. Methods. Two hundred images (100 normal CCAs, 50 CCAs with an increased intima-media thickness, 30 with fibrous plaques, and 20 with anechoic plaques) were processed to delineate the region of interest containing the CCA. The strategy is an integrated approach (carotid artery layer extraction using an integrated approach [CALEXia]) consisting of geometric feature extraction, line fitting, and classification. The output of the algorithm is the tracings of the proximal and distal adventitia layers. Performance of the algorithm was validated against human tracings considered the ground truth. Results. The mean distance errors +/- SD using this integrated approach were 1.05 +/- 1.04 pixels (0.07 +/- 0.07 mm) for proximal or near adventitia and 2.68 +/- 3.94 pixels (0.17 +/- 0.24 mm) for distal or far adventitia. Sixteen of 200 images were not perfectly traced because of the presence of both plaques and blood backscattering. The computational cost ensures the possibility for near real-time detection. Conclusions. Although the CALEXia algorithm automatically detects the CCA, it is also robust and validated over a large database. This can constitute a general basis for a completely automated segmentation procedure widely applicable to other anatomies.									53	0	0	14	0	53			0278-4297			WOS:000275685900009	20194936

Nanoparticles were characterized on their structure, morphology, and luminescent properties. We discuss the synthesis, properties, and application of heavy metal fluorides; specifically LaF(3):RE and PbF(2), and group IIA fluorides. Particular attention is given to the synthesis of core/shell nanoparticles, including selectively RE-doped LaF(3)/LaF(3), and CaF(2)/CaF(2) core/(multi-)shell nanoparticles, and the CaF(2)-LaF(3) system.									24	1	0	2	0	24			1996-1944			WOS:000298240500027

Evolutionary Lineages and Functional Diversification of Plant Hexokinases								MOLECULAR PLANT				3	2			334	346		10.1093/mp/ssq003			MAR 2010	2010	Sequencing data from 10 species show that a plant hexokinase (HXK) family contains 5-11 genes. Functionally, a given family can include metabolic catalysts, glucose signaling proteins, and non-catalytic, apparent regulatory enzyme homologs. This study has two goals. The first aim is to develop a predictive method to determine which HXK proteins within a species have which type of function. The second aim is to determine whether HXK-dependent glucose signaling proteins occur among more primitive plants, as well as among angiosperms. Using a molecular phylogeny approach, combined with selective experimental testing, we found that non-catalytic HXK homologs might occur in all plants, including the relatively primitive Selaginella moellendorffi. We also found that different lineages of angiosperm HXKs have apparent conserved features for catalytic activity and for sub-cellular targeting. Most higher-plant HXKs are expressed predominantly at mitochondria, with HXKs of one lineage occurring in the plastid, and HXKs of one monocot lineage occurring in the cytosol. Using protoplast transient expression assays, we found that HXK glucose signaling proteins occur likely in all higher plants and in S. moellendorffi as well. Thus, the use of glucose by plant HXK isoforms in metabolism and/or as a regulatory metabolite occurs as widespread, conserved processes.									25	5	0	23	1	27			1674-2052	1752-9867		WOS:000276844600007	20145006

To our best knowledge it is the first time these complex CuO nanostructures could be synthesized using an almost identical synthetic route with simply changing the reaction solvent. Compared with the other synthesis methods that have been reported in the literatures, this self-assembled synthesis provided easier route to form diverse complex CuO nanostructures. The obtained CuO nanostructures were characterized with scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectra, X-ray Diffraction, and Raman spectra. Possible formation mechanisms of these CuO nanoscale structures are also discussed.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1941-4900	1941-4919		WOS:000293156700008

The core-clad fiber has been drawn from a core-clad preform prepared via rotational casting. Using Cu as a tracer to assess interface quality between the core and clad layers, we show excellent cladding layer thickness uniformity across lengths of up to 40 mm in a 65 mm long perform. No measurable diffusion of Cu between the core and the clad has been observed, within the accuracy of measurement, indicating good stability and interface quality during casting of melted glass. Micro-Raman spectroscopy has been used to identify subtle post-draw structural modification induced in the preform following the fiber drawing. These changes have been attributed to modification to the bulk glass' thermal history upon drawing and small scale molecular orientation of chain units within the tellurite glass matrix produced during the fiber drawing process. The resulting fiber was found to have an index step of (0.009 +/- 0.002) between the fiber core and clad composition at 632 nm and propagation losses of (3.2 +/- 0.1) dB/m at 632 nm and (2.1 +/- 0.1) dB/m at 1.5 mu m. The primary source of loss in the near-IR (NIR) is associated with residual hydroxyl (OH(-)) groups in the bulk preform which remain in the glass fiber. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Three fuels were used urea, glycine and hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) and the nanopowders were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, photoluminescence, fluorescence lifetime, and thermoluminescence measurements. The dominant crystallographic phase was cubic, with crystallite size being insensitive to the hydrostatic pressure but increasing for fuels with higher heat of combustion. At least for nanopowders obtained using fuels with higher heats of combustion, higher Ar hydrostatic pressures lead to lower photoluminescence output. Fluorescence lifetime measurements on HMT-prepared samples yielded lifetimes of 330 and 900 ns for Bi3+ ions in S-6 and C-2 sites, respectively, and no variation in these values was observed for hydrostatic pressures from 0.1 to 9.7 MPa. Shorter lifetime values than reported for conventional SCS are likely related to higher concentration of quenching defects. In agreement with these results, thermoluminescence measurements showed that higher concentrations of electronic traps are present in samples synthesized under higher pressures.

More specifically, a phosphate glass-clad fiber containing an indium antimonide (InSb) core was drawn using a molten core approach. The core was found to be highly crystalline with some oxygen and phosphorus diffusing in from the cladding glass. While optical transmission measurements were unable to be made, most likely due to free carrier absorption associated with the conductivity of the core, this work constitutes a proof-of-concept that optical fibers comprising semiconductor cores of higher crystallographic complexity than previously realized can be drawn using conventional fiber fabrication techniques. Such binary semiconductors may open the door to future fiber-based nonlinear devices. (C) 2010 Optical Society of America									31	0	0	2	0	31			1094-4087			WOS:000275454100025	20389508

We argue that coworkers will directly (through inquiry via cohesive friendship and advice ties) and indirectly (through monitoring of employees structurally equivalent in advice and friendship networks) affect employees' perceived organizational Support. Network Studies in the admissions department of a large public University and a private company specializing in food and animal safety products indicate that employees' POS are similar to those of coworkers with whom they maintain advice relationships as well as to those who hold structurally equivalent positions in organizational friendship and advice networks. Our work contributes to organizational support theory by developing and testing a theoretical explanation for the relationship between the social context and perceptions Of Support among employees.

These so-called persister cells keep themselves in a dormant state and thus are insensitive to antibiotic treatment, resulting in serious problems of drug resistance. In this paper, we proposed a novel strategy to 'kill' persister cells by triggering them to switch, in a fast and synchronized way, into normally growing cells that are susceptible to antibiotics. The strategy is based on resonant activation (RA), a well-studied phenomenon in physics where the internal noise of a system can constructively facilitate fast and synchronized barrier crossings. Through stochastic Gilliespie simulation with a generic toggle switch model, we demonstrated that RA exists in the phenotypic switching of a single bacterium. Further, by coupling single cell level and population level simulations, we showed that with RA, one can greatly reduce the time and total amount of antibiotics needed to sterilize a bacterial population. We suggest that resonant activation is a general phenomenon in phenotypic transition, and can find other applications such as cancer therapy.									5	0	1	2	0	6			1478-3967			WOS:000275496400015	20147776

By a combination of analytical and numerical arguments, we show that there is a robust low-temperature positive peak (i.e., maximum) in the temperature dependence of the Nernst coefficient when the DDW state is ambipolar, i.e., when the broken symmetry supports the coexistence of both electron- and holelike quasiparticles in the excitation spectrum, and the electron pocket dominates at the low temperatures. In contrast, the Nernst coefficient is negative and there is no such positive peak if the underlying state is nonambipolar, i.e., when it supports only one type of quasiparticles. More generally, in the ambipolar state, the sign of the Nernst coefficient can be positive or negative depending on the dominance of the electron or hole pockets, respectively, in the low temperature thermoelectric transport. By modeling the pseudogap phase by a doping-dependent DDW order parameter with a Fermi surface topology that supports both hole and electron pockets, and assuming energy-independent transport scattering times, we analyze the evolution of the Nernst effect with doping concentration at low temperatures in the cuprate phase diagram. Even though the chosen ambipolar DDW state with a specific Fermi surface topology is not the only possible explanation of either the recent quantum oscillation experiments or the recent observation of a negative Hall coefficient at low temperatures in the underdoped cuprates, it is at least one possible state qualitatively consistent with both of these experiments. As such, the calculations in this paper present at least one possible scenario for the observed enhanced Nernst signals in the underdoped cuprates.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1098-0121			WOS:000276248700111

The authors focus on religious representation in Congress, examining the extent to which senators' own religious affiliation and the relative size of their religious constituencies affect substantive representation of Religious Right interests. The authors find that Christian senators (evangelical Protestants, conservative Catholics, and Mormons alike) provide better representation of the Religious Right, as do senators from states with larger Christian constituencies. The findings demonstrate that substantive representation is the product of characteristics of both the representatives and the represented.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1065-9129			WOS:000275004100006

Investigation of detention pond outflow characteristics								PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-WATER MANAGEMENT				163	3			123	131		10.1680/wama.2010.163.3.123			MAR 2010	2010	Detention ponds are important units of drainage system for managing excess rainfall and runoff quality. To design detention ponds the outflow characteristic must be accurately known. Perforated riser pipes are a popular outlet control structure for stormwater detention basins. This study examines the discharge characteristics of a circular orifice cut into a vertical riser pipe as an outflow mechanism for the detention pond. In particular, the effects of the head above the orifice, the size of the orifice and the size of the riser pipe on the discharge coefficient are evaluated. A physical model is built and various size riser pipes are installed in the tank to simulate a detention basin. The discharge through the orifice is determined by measuring the rate of change of the water level in the tank against time. A water level against volume drained calibration is used to find the rate of change of volume over time, and hence the discharge coefficient. The study shows that the discharge coefficient increases as the head and the ratio of the orifice diameter to pipe diameter decreases. It is found that the hydrostatic pressure variation across the orifice at the small head has a minimum impact on the discharge. A generalised function is developed to estimate discharge under a varying head over the orifice and for different ratios of orifice diameter to riser pipe diameter, which can be used for the design of detention ponds.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1741-7589			WOS:000275662300003

In recent times, several PLA-based technologies have emerged with an emphasis on achieving chemical, mechanical, and biological properties equivalent or superior to conventional polymers. The frequent need for a chemical or physical modification of PLA to achieve suitable properties for its intended consumer and biomedical applications, however, has demanded significant attention in the last decade. In the first part of this review, we briefly discuss the advantages, limitations, production methods, and applications of unmodified PLA. The second part, the major objective of this paper, focuses on the various bulk and surface-modification strategies used to date and their basic principles, drawbacks, and achievements.

We examine the behavior of prices as events unfold in a baseball game. Specifically, we compare the evolution of prices during a game with probability estimates generated by an empirical model of scoring in baseball. We find that price changes correspond closely to changes in the probability of winning, for plays of both small and dramatic impact. Nevertheless, data limitations inhibit the ability to make strong claims regarding the hypothesis of efficient pricing.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0048-5829			WOS:000274326200005

The purpose of the research is to explore the nature and causes of religious segmentation and realignment. A model of religious schism is developed and illustrated with reference to many different religions. The model is then directly applied to Islamic history. Schism occurs because of innovations in dogma or practice. These innovations must appeal to demanders of the religious product. However, the innovations themselves may be driven by organizational conflicts within firms supplying religion. A special situation is created when schism occurs within a state-supported supplier of religion. Our study leads us to revisit the debate between Hume and Smith over the effect of state religion.

We carried out investigation to gain insight on the underpinning mechanisms related to this enhancement. Gd2O3:Eu nanoparticles were prepared by SCS and characterized in their structure, crystallinity, crystallite size, photoluminescence (PL) and PL lifetime. After synthesis, samples were calcined at 500 degrees C for 4 h to eliminate organic residues, and annealed in air at 1000 degrees C for up to 180 min. The fast increase of PL intensity in the first similar to 15 min of annealing is understood by the decrease of the probability of non-radiative recombination through the elimination of quenching defects. This is in agreement with increasing crystallinity, as determined by the absolute intensity of the (222) and (440) diffraction peaks as a function of annealing time. The systematic measurements of crystallinity, crystallite size, PL intensity and lifetime as a function of annealing time carried out in this work supports the assignment of a major role to crystallization and the elimination of structural disorder on PL yield of SCS-prepared materials.

The OSL of three common scintillators, Y(2)SiO(5):Ce (YSO), Gd(2)SiO(5):Ce (GSO), and Lu(2)SiO(5):Ce (LSO), were tested. The property which makes these compounds good scintillators, efficient recombination of electron-hole pairs created by ionizing radiation, should make them poor candidates for OSL materials, since OSL requires the creation of electron-hole pairs trapped separately in defects in the crystal lattice. However, defects in the crystal structure can provide a pathway for the OSL phenomenon to take place. Based on the stimulation and emission OSL spectra of the oxyorthosilicates, a CW-OSL reader was built and used to test the samples' OSL capabilities. The results showed that YSO showed promising OSL, characterized by a strong initial OSL intensity and fast OSL decay, while GSO and LSO were impractical for OSL applications due to low response and high background signal, respectively. Further characterization of YSO included the determination of the OSL dose response and the characteristics of OSL decay curves. The results are compared to carbon-doped aluminum oxide (Al(2)O(3):C), a common OSL dosimetric material. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Recently, high dimensional data, such as microarray, exhibits a very high dimension p and a much smaller sample size n. There are discussions about the behavior of the ridge estimator when both p and n tend to infinity, but very few dealing with n fixed and p -> infinity. The latter situation seems more relevant to microarray data in practice. Here we outline and describe the asymptotic properties of the ridge estimator when the sample size n is fixed and the dimension p -> infinity. Under certain regularity conditions, mean square error (MSE) consistency of the ridge estimator is established. We also propose a variable screening method to eliminate variables which are unrelated to the outcome and prove the consistency of the screening procedure. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Vertex-Edge Domination								UTILITAS MATHEMATICA				81				193	213					MAR 2010	2010	Most of the research on domination focuses on vertices dominating other vertices. In this paper we consider vertex-edge domination where a vertex dominates the edges incident to it as well as the edges adjacent to these incident edges. The minimum cardinality of a vertex-edge dominating set of a graph G is the vertex-edge domination number gamma(ve)(G). We present bounds on gamma(ve)(G) and relationships between gamma(ve)(G) and other domination related parameters. Since any ordinary dominating set is also a vertex-edge dominating set, it follows that gamma(ve)(G) is bounded above by the domination number of G. Our main result characterizes the trees having equal domination and vertex-edge domination numbers.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0315-3681			WOS:000276283400014

Evaluation of strategies for anaerobic bioremediation of high concentrations of halomethanes								WATER RESEARCH				44	5			1317	1328		10.1016/j.watres.2009.10.035			MAR 2010	2010	Bioremediation is being considered for groundwater at an industrial site contaminated with carbon tetrachloride (CT), trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11), and chloroform (CF), at concentrations typically considered too high for biological treatment. 1,1-Dichloroethene is also present. The objective of this study was to evaluate in situ anaerobic remediation by biostimulation alone (lactate, emulsified vegetable oil, and corn syrup), biostimulation (corn syrup) supplemented with vitamin B(12) (cyanocobalamin), and bioaugmentation in combination with catalytic levels of B(12). Three cultures were evaluated for enhancing biotransformation of CT, CFC-11 and CF: two were sulfate reducing enrichments (grown on lactate and ethanol, respectively), based on a high concentration of sulfate in the groundwater; the other was a fermentative enrichment grown on corn syrup. A microcosm study with soil and groundwater (neutralized to pH 7) from the site revealed that bioaugmentation is a potentially feasible treatment approach, with complete biotransformation of 8.8 mg/L CT, 26 mg/L CFC-11, and 500 mg/L of CF in approximately 500 days. The lactate-grown sulfate reducing culture and the corn syrup-grown fermentative culture were the most effective. Subsequent bioaugmentation with a chloroethene-respiring culture yielded rapid reduction of 1,1-dichloroethene (9.1 mg/L) to ethene. Complete transformation of CT, CFC-11 and CF was also observed with corn syrup + B(12), although the time required was twice as long compared to bioaugmentation. In the presence of B(12), biotransformation of [(14)C]CT and [(14)C]CF yielded mainly CO, CO(2), and organic acids. CT was consistently transformed first, followed by CFC-11 and then CF. Corn syrup was only partially effective for halomethane removal without B(12), but was more effective than emulsified vegetable oil or lactate. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, the fate and transport of CNTs in aqueous solutions have attracted extensive attention. In the present work, the effects of natural organic matter (NOM), solution pH and ionic strength on adsorption of three synthetic organic chemicals (SOCs) by both pristine and surface functionalized single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) were investigated. The three SOCs (phenanthrene, biphenyl, and 2-phenylphenol) with different planarity, polarity, and hydrogen/electron-donor/acceptor ability, representing typical scenarios for the SOC-CNT interactions, were employed as probe molecules. Among the three background solution characteristics examined, NOM showed the most significant effect on SOC adsorption, while solution pH and ionic strength exhibited minimal or negligible impacts. The presence of NOM greatly suppressed the SOC adsorption by CNTs, and the impact on the SWNTs was higher than that on the MWNTs. The planarity and hydrophobicity of SOCs were two important factors determining the effects of NOM, solution pH and ionic strength on their adsorption by CNTs. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

An activity and XANES study of Mn-promoted, Fe-based Fischer-Tropsch catalysts								APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL				375	1			12	16		10.1016/j.apcata.2009.11.015			FEB 26 2010	2010	Iron-based Fischer-Tropsch (FT) catalysts with a mol-based formula of (100 - x)Fe/xMn/5Cu/17SiO(2) (x <= 20), were prepared using co-precipitation methods. The calcined catalysts were first activated in H-2 for 12 h, then reacted in flowing syngas at 1.8 atm, 280 degrees C, and a 2:1 ratio of H2:CO. The fresh and reacted catalysts were characterized using X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) to determine changes in the oxidation state and the atomic-level environment of the Fe and Mn atoms. XANES spectra of the fresh calcined and reacted catalyst were taken using the K edges of Fe (7.112 KeV) and Mn (6.540 KeV) for various Mn-metal loadings (x = 0, 5, 20). The FT activity significantly increased with Mn promotion, indicating significant Fe-Mn interactions. The least squares fitting of the reacted catalyst shows that higher Mn loadings lead to decreased FexC concentration and increased Fe3O4 concentration. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of Fe indicates that the Fe2O3, Fe3O4, theta-Fe3C phases were present in either the calcined or reacted catalyst. One additional Fe-containing phase was present in the catalyst but was not identified using the Fe standards. The PCA of Mn showed the presence of Mn2O3, as well as one additional Mn-containing phase. The Mn XANES of the reacted 95Fe5Mn and 80Fe20Mn catalysts show that Mn was a mixture of the 2+ and 3+ oxidation states. The average oxidation state of Mn in the reacted 95Fe5Mn catalyst was 2.24 +/- 0.07, consistent with the formation of an additional phase, identified as (Fe1-yMny)(3)O-4. FEFF calculations have shown relatively good agreement for Mn-substitution of octahedral Fe-sites in Fe3O4 (28664-ICSD), specifically in the pre-edge region; corresponding to the composition (Fe1-yMny)(3)O-4. Fe-based FT catalysts deactivate when carbon deposition occurs on larger iron carbide clusters. This study has shown less carbon deposition, FexC formation, and higher CO hydrogenation activity with the Mn-promoted catalysts. This indicates that (Fe1-yMny)(3)O-4 was responsible for the formation of smaller clusters of FexC, which were more active for CO hydrogenation and were less prone to deactivation through carbon deposition.

Cool-weather activity of the forensically important hairy maggot blow fly Chrysomya rufifacies (Macquart) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) on carrion in Upstate South Carolina, United States								FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL				195	1-3			139	142		10.1016/j.forsciint.2009.12.007			FEB 25 2010	2010	The hairy maggot blow fly Chrysomya rufifacies (Macquart) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) has expanded its range in the United States since its introduction into Texas (ca. 1980) and has been collected in 15 states. We investigated the bionomics of immature and adult C. rufifacies collected from carcasses of a raccoon Procyon lotor (Linnaeus) and white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus Zimmerman in Upstate South Carolina during November 2007, and used these insects to estimate the minimum period of insect activity. Puparia of C. rufifacies were collected from deer carrion; 28% were parasitized by Nasonia vitripennis (Walker) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae). The mean daily ambient temperature during this study was 11.4 +/- 1.02 degrees C, representing the lowest recorded mean temperature for adult activity of C. rufifacies; adults of C. rufifacies were observed flying among the carcasses at 9.0 degrees C. Although C. rufifacies is considered a warm-weather blow fly, researchers should be aware of its activity at suboptimal conditions, behavior that might aid its expansion into more northern areas.

Deactivation and regeneration of visible light active brookite titania in photocatalytic degradation of organic dye								JOURNAL OF PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND PHOTOBIOLOGY A-CHEMISTRY				210	2-3			162	167		10.1016/j.jphotochem.2009.12.018			FEB 25 2010	2010	This study was performed to investigate deactivation and regeneration of predominantly brookite titania powders. Visible light active (VLA) polymorphic titania particles were prepared by a water-based ambient condition sol (WACS) process followed by a solvent-based ambient condition sol (SACS) process with N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) as the solvent. Deactivation of all samples was evaluated by degradation of methyl orange (MO) dye under either UV or VL irradiation for four reaction cycle runs. The photocatalytic activity (PCA) under VL exposure of NMP samples calcined at 200 degrees C for 2 h in air (NMP-200) was approximately 3.3 times higher than that of a commercial VIA titania (Kronos VLP7000), despite the much lower surface area of the NMP-200. Nonetheless, PCA of all titania samples under VL gradually decreased with an increase in testing time and number of runs. The cause of the deactivation of the titania samples in this study was identified as the deposition of the decomposed MO on the titania nanoparticle surface. Among the possible regeneration or reactivation procedures for the used samples, methanol washing was shown to be the most effective up to similar to 80% of the PCA recovery. The used NMP-200 samples could not completely be recovered, since a regeneration process would possibly remove some of nitrogen species responsible for the VLA. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Flip, flop and fly: modulated motor control and highly variable movement patterns of autotomized gecko tails								BIOLOGY LETTERS				6	1			70	73		10.1098/rsbl.2009.0577			FEB 23 2010	2010	Many animals lose and regenerate appendages, and tail autotomy in lizards is an extremely well-studied example of this. Whereas the energetic, ecological and functional ramifications of tail loss for many lizards have been extensively documented, little is known about the behaviour and neuromuscular control of the autotomized tail. We used electromyography and high-speed video to quantify the motor control and movement patterns of autotomized tails of leopard geckos (Eublepharis macularius). In addition to rhythmic swinging, we show that they exhibit extremely complex movement patterns for up to 30 min following autotomy, including acrobatic flips up to 3 cm in height. Unlike the output of most central pattern generators (CPGs), muscular control of the tail is variable and can be arrhythmic. We suggest that the gecko tail is well suited for studies involving CPGs, given that this spinal preparation is naturally occurring, requires no surgery and exhibits complex modulation.									15	0	0	14	0	15			1744-9561			WOS:000273501700020	19740891

Our Pleiades, selected for their small projected rotational velocity and modest chromospheric emission, evince substantial scatter in the line strengths of lambda 6707 Li I feature that is absent in the lambda 7699 K I resonance line. The Li I scatter is not correlated with that in the high-excitation lambda 7774 O I feature, and the magnitude of the former is greater than the latter despite the larger temperature sensitivity of the O I feature. These results suggest that systematic errors in line strength measurements due to blending, color (or color-based T(eff)) errors, or line formation effects related to an overlying chromosphere are not the principal source of Li I scatter in our stars. There do exist analytic spot models that can produce, via line formation effects, the observed Li scatter without introducing scatter in the K I line strengths or the color-magnitude diagram. However, these models predict factor of >= 3 differences in abundances derived from the subordinate lambda 6104 and resonance lambda 6707 Li I features; we find no difference in the abundances determined from these two features. These analytic spot models also predict CN line strengths significantly larger than we observe in our spectra. The simplest explanation of the Li, K, CN, and photometric data is that there must be a real abundance component to the Pleiades Li dispersion. We suggest that this real abundance component is the manifestation of relic differences in erstwhile pre-main-sequence Li burning caused by effects of surface activity on stellar structure. We discuss observational predictions of these effects, which may be related to other anomalous stellar phenomena.									21	0	0	0	0	21			0004-637X			WOS:000274233300054

These include mesenchymal condensation, chondrogenesis, ossification of the medial footplate and shaft, and joint formation between the persistent cartilage of the extracolumella and ossified columella. Middle and external ear defects are responsible for approximately 10% of congenital hearing defects. Thus, understanding the morphogenesis and the molecular mechanisms of the formation of the middle ear is important to understanding normal and abnormal development of this essential component of the hearing apparatus.Results: The columella, which arises from proximal ectomesenchyme of the second pharyngeal arch, is induced and patterned in a dynamic multi-step process. From the footplate, which inserts into the inner ear oval window, the shaft spans the pneumatic middle ear cavity, and the extracolumella inserts into the tympanic membrane. Through marker gene and immunolabeling analysis, we have determined the onset of each stage in the columella's development, from condensation to ossification. Significantly, a single condensation with the putative shaft and extracolumella arms already distinguishable is observed shortly before initiation of five separate chondrogenic centers within these structures. Ossification begins later, with periosteum formation in the shaft and, unexpectedly, a separate periosteum in the footplate.Conclusions: The data presented in this study document the spatiotemporal events leading to morphogenesis of the columella and middle ear structures and provide the first gene expression data for this region. These data identify candidate genes and facilitate future functional studies and elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of columella formation.									7	0	0	7	0	7			1471-213X			WOS:000275577400001	20158901

Two of the most frequently studied rules in the literature - CONWIP and DBR - were included in the simulation. Data analysis found that the workload control rules had a significant positive effect on the shop performance measures only in environments with the highest bottleneck utilization and the lowest protective capacity. However, the work aggregation method was found to be an important component of the workload control rule. Suggestions were made for future research that could increase our understanding of workload control rules and integrate this research with our understanding of lean production. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.

The emphasis is placed on the direct current (DC) dielectrophoretic (DEP) effect arising from the interactions between the induced spatially nonuniform electric Field around the corner and the dielectric particles. A transient multiphysics model is developed in all arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) framework, which comprises the Navier-Stokes equations for the fluid flow and the Laplace equation for the electrical potential. The predictions of the DEP-induced particle trajectory shift in the L-shaped microchannel are in quantitative agreement with the obtained experimental results. Numerical Studies also show that the DEP effect call alter the angular velocity and even the direction of the particle's rotation. Further parametric Studies suggest that the L-shaped microfluidic channel may be utilized to focus and separate particles by size via the induced DEP effect.									44	1	0	18	0	45			0743-7463			WOS:000274342200109	19852473

Despite a high-temperature synthesis, these new solids exhibit unusually porous (similar to 2-nm-diameter) vanadium arsenate frameworks. Disordered metal chloride salts reside inside the pores, leading to relatively large voids (up to similar to 7.2% of the unit cell volume), which were confirmed by surface area (SA) measurements of the as-prepared polycrystalline samples (similar to 90-110 m(2)/g). Given the potential utility of porous POV-containing materials, efforts were made to study changes in the SAs (showing similar to 35-70% increases) upon salt removal and redox chemistry.									13	0	0	1	0	13			0020-1669			WOS:000274240700016	20067237

To explore the origins of simian RVs, the complete genome sequences of strains PTRV (G8P[1]), RRV (G3P[3]), and TUCH (G3P[24]) were determined. These data allowed the genotype constellations of each virus to be determined and the phylogenetic relationships of the simian strains with each other and with nonsimian RVs to be elucidated. The results indicate that PTRV was likely transmitted from a bovine or other ruminant into pig-tailed macaques (its host of origin), since its genes have genotypes and encode outer-capsid proteins similar to those of bovine RVs. In contrast, most of the genes of rhesus-macaque strains, RRV and TUCH, have genotypes more typical of canine-feline RVs. However, the sequences of the canine and/or feline (canine/feline)-like genes of RRV and TUCH are only distantly related to those of modern canine/feline RVs, indicating that any potential transmission of a progenitor of these viruses from a canine/feline host to a simian host was not recent. The remaining genes of RRV and TUCH appear to have originated through reassortment with bovine, human, or other RV strains. Finally, comparison of PTRV, RRV, and TUCH genes with those of the vervet-monkey RV SA11-H96 (G3P[2]) indicates that SA11-H96 shares little genetic similarity to other simian strains and likely has evolved independently. Collectively, our data indicate that simian RVs are of diverse ancestry with genome constellations that originated largely by interspecies transmission and reassortment with nonhuman animal RVs.									33	3	0	31	0	37			0022-538X			WOS:000273853200035	19939934

The molecular mechanisms connecting photoperiod perception, growth cessation and dormancy entrance in perennials are not clearly understood. The peach [Prunus persica (L.) Batsch] evergrowing (evg) mutant fails to cease growth and therefore cannot enter dormancy under SD. We used the evg mutant to filter gene expression associated with growth cessation after exposure to SD. Wild-type and evg plants were grown under controlled conditions of long days (16 h/8h) followed by transfer to SD (8h/16h) for eight weeks. Apical tissues were sampled at zero, one, two, four, and eight weeks of SD and suppression subtractive hybridization was performed between genotypes at the same time points.Results: We identified 23 up-regulated genes in the wild-type with respect to the mutant during SD exposure. We used quantitative real-time PCR to verify the expression of the differentially expressed genes in wild-type tissues following the transition to SD treatment. Three general expression patterns were evident: one group of genes decreased at the time of growth cessation (after 2 weeks in SD), another that increased immediately after the SD exposure and then remained steady, and another that increased throughout SD exposure.Conclusions: The use of the dormancy-incapable mutant evg has allowed us to reduce the number of genes typically detected by differential display techniques for SD experiments. These genes are candidates for involvement in the signalling pathway leading from photoperiod perception to growth cessation and dormancy entrance and will be the target of future investigations.									30	3	0	32	0	33			1471-2229			WOS:000275403100002	20144228

Ag3Fe(VO4)(2) (SFVO-1) and AgFeV2O7 (SFVO-2) were isolated via a pseudoternary (Ag2O-Fe2O3-V2O5) system at 600 degrees C. The crystallographic data of the phases are the following: Ag3Fe(VO4)(2) monoclinic C2/c (no. 15), a = 9.771(2) angstrom, b = 5.153(1) angstrom, c.= 14.325(3) angstrom, beta = 93.8 5(3)degrees, V = 719.7(2) angstrom(3), Z = 4; AgFeV2O7, triclinic, P1 (no. 2), a = 5.603(1) angstrom, b = 7.485(2) angstrom, c = 7.644(2) angstrom, alpha = 65.07(3)degrees, beta = 89.48(3)degrees, gamma = 78.98(3)degrees, V = 284.4(1) angstrom(3), Z = 2. The single crystal X-ray diffraction studies show that the Ag+ cations reside in the open space of layered (SFVO-1) and channeled (SFVO-2) Fe-O-V frameworks. The extended electrochemical capacity above 2 V (vs Li/Li+) in these phases is consistent with their higher (Ag++Fe3+)/V5+ ratios, compared to the corresponding Ag+/V5+ in Ag2V4O11 (SVO). The discharge voltage of SFVO-1 exhibits a short initial plateau at similar to 3.15 V, corresponding to the reduction of 0.5 x [Ag(I) -> Ag(0)], followed by an abrupt drop to similar to 2.3-2.0 V where the remaining silver (2.5 equiv Li) and some of the framework iron (0.8 equiv Li) are reduced. SFVO-2 has a nominal capacity of 293 mA h/g exhibiting several plateaulike features between 2.5 and 2.0 V. SFVO-1,2 represents the first family of silver iron(III) vanadate phases that have been systematically investigated.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0897-4756			WOS:000274089600066

From, Andrew/0000-0002-6543-2627			Predicting the retreat and migration of tidal forests along the northern Gulf of Mexico under sea-level rise								FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT				259	4	SI		770	777		10.1016/j.foreco.2009.10.023			FEB 5 2010	2010	Tidal freshwater forests in coastal regions of the southeastern United States are undergoing dieback and retreat from increasing tidal inundation and saltwater intrusion attributed to climate variability and sea-level rise. In many areas, tidal saltwater forests (mangroves) contrastingly are expanding landward in subtropical coastal reaches succeeding freshwater marsh and forest zones. Hydrological characteristics of these low-relief coastal forests in intertidal settings are dictated by the influence of tidal and freshwater forcing. In this paper, we describe the application of the Sea Level Over Proportional Elevation (SLOPE) model to predict coastal forest retreat and migration from projected sea-level rise based on a proxy relationship of saltmarsh/mangrove area and tidal range. The SLOPE model assumes that the sum area of saltmarsh/mangrove habitat along any given coastal reach is determined by the slope of the landform and vertical tide forcing. Model results indicated that saltmarsh and mangrove migration from sea-level rise will vary by county and watershed but greater in western Gulf States than in the eastern Gulf States where millions of hectares of coastal forest will be displaced over the next century with a near meter rise in relative sea level alone. Substantial losses of coastal forests will also occur in the eastern Gulf but mangrove forests in subtropical zones of Florida are expected to replace retreating freshwater forest and affect regional biodiversity. Accelerated global eustacy from climate change will compound the degree of predicted retreat and migration of coastal forests with expected implications for ecosystem management of State and Federal lands in the absence of adaptive coastal management.

Without requiring a priori probability of target presence, the fusion threshold bounds derived using Chebyshev's inequality ensure a higher hit rate and lower false alarm rate compared to the weighted averages of individual sensors. The Monte Carlo-based simulation results show that the proposed approach significantly improves target detection performance, and can also be used to guide the actual threshold selection in practical sensor network implementation under certain error rate constraints.									14	1	0	0	0	15			1550-4859			WOS:000275163100009

Probing these phenomena in biomolecular systems requires electromechanical measurements be performed in liquid environments. Here we demonstrate the use of band excitation piezoresponse force microscopy for probing electromechanical coupling in amyloid fibrils. The approaches for separating the elastic and electromechanical contributions based on functional fits and multivariate statistical analysis are presented. We demonstrate that in the bulk of the fibril the electromechanical response is dominated by double-layer effects (consistent with shear piezoelectricity of biomolecules), while a number of electromechanically active hot spots possibly related to structural defects are observed.									19	0	0	2	0	19			1936-0851			WOS:000274635800015	20088597

Function models are graph-based representations used to describe the functionality of engineered artifacts, Where the nodes are function verbs and the edges are the objects of action. The functional basis, a controlled vocabulary of these verbs and nouns organized in it three level hierarchy, is intended to support consistent representation of function models. The Design Repository is a Web-based archive Of function models of consumer products described With the functional basis. This paper presents the theoretical underpinnings of a metric for the information content of function models, the assumptions required to Support it, the definitions of key terms associated with it. and its practical interpretation. Finally, the Metric is Used to study the Usefulness Of the functional basis through a series of experiments on function models within the Design Repository.

Whispering Gallery Mode Laser in an Elliptical Microring								APPLIED COMPUTATIONAL ELECTROMAGNETICS SOCIETY JOURNAL				25	2			99	107					FEB 2010	2010	Studies on whispering gallery mode (WGM) laser in microrings have been limited to circular geometry. Elliptical microring lasers, despite their potential engineering use, have not been analyzed to guide experiments. This paper introduces a computationally efficient method for determining the WGM laser resonance and the laser field distribution in an elliptical microring. An analytical method is applied to avoid computing high order Mathieu functions. Both WGM resonant frequencies and electromagnetic (EM) field distributions are computed and presented in this paper. Computed results clearly show that the WGM laser field is concentrated on the outer surface of the microring. Results also show that the eccentricity of the ellipse affects the distribution of resonant frequencies and the laser field.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1054-4887			WOS:000277415600001

This paper intends to prepare the mathematical groundwork for extended use of the HT technique for three-dimensional and/or time-correlated measurements. Direct application of the methods developed previously encounters both experimental and computational difficulties. Numerical studies reported in this paper suggest that the use of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is effective to overcome these difficulties. The use of POD in HT significantly reduces the computational cost, enhances the fidelity of the tomographic reconstructions, and improves the stability of the reconstruction in the presence of measurement noise. Implications of these results for practical applications are also discussed. (C) 2010 Optical Society of America									20	1	0	0	0	21			1559-128X	2155-3165		WOS:000274443600008	20119007

This paper presents a review of results from recent X-ray observations of M 31 with XMM-Newton and Chandra. We carried out a dedicated optical and X-ray monitoring program of CNe and SSSs in the central area of M 31. We discovered the first SSSs in M 31 globular clusters (GCs) and their connection to the very first discovered CN in a M 31 GC. This result may have an impact on the CN rate in GCs. Furthermore, in our optical and X-ray monitoring data we discovered the CN M31N 2007-11a, which shows a very short SSS phase of 29-52 days. Short SSS states (durations <= 100 days) of CNe indicate massive white dwarfs (WDs) that are candidate progenitors of supernovae type Ia. In the case of M31N 2007-11a, the optical and X-ray light curves suggest a binary containing a WD with M(WD) > 1.0 M(circle dot). Finally, we present the discovery of the SSS counterpart of the CN M31N 2006-04a. The X-ray light curve of M31N 2006-04a shows short-time variability, which might indicate an orbital period of about 2 hours. (C) 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

To address this issue, we designed a series of platelet adhesion studies to clearly separate these two factors, thus enabling us to definitively determine whether it is the amount or the conformation of adsorbed Fg that mediates platelet response. Fg was adsorbed to a broad range of surface chemistries from a wide range of solution concentrations, with the amount and conformation of adsorbed Fg determined by absorbance and circular dichroism (CD) spectropolarimetry, respectively. Platelet adhesion response was determined by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Our results show that platelet adhesion is strongly correlated with the degree of adsorption-induced unfolding of Fg (r(2) = 0.96) with essentially no correlation with the amount of Fg adsorbed (r(2) = 0.04). Platelet receptor inhibitor studies using an RGDS peptide reduced platelet adhesion by only about 50%, and SEM results show that adherent platelets after RGDS blocking were much more rounded with minimal extended filopodia compared with the unblocked platelets. These results provide definitive proof that the conformation of adsorbed Fg is the critical determinant of platelet adhesion, not the amount of Fg adsorbed, with adsorption-induced unfolding potentially exposing two distinctly different types of platelet binding sites in Fg; one that induces platelet adhesion alone and one that induces both platelet adhesion and activation.

Recent studies have suggested that platelets adhere to adsorbed Alb by mechanisms linked to its conformational state. To definitively address this issue we used circular dichroism (CD) spectropolarimetry to characterize the conformation of Alb adsorbed on a broad range of surface chemistries from a wide range of Alb solution concentrations, with platelet adhesion examined using a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Our results prove that platelets bind to adsorbed Alb through receptor-mediated processes, with binding sites in Alb exposed and/or formed by adsorption-induced protein unfolding. Most importantly, beyond a critical degree of unfolding, the platelet adhesion levels correlated strongly with the adsorption-induced unfolding in Alb. The blockage of Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) specific platelet receptors using an Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) peptide led to significant inhibition of platelet adhesion to adsorbed Alb, with the extent of inhibition and morphology of adherent platelets being similar for both Alb and Fg. Chemical neutralization of arginine (Arg) residues in the adsorbed Alb layer inhibited platelet-Alb interactions significantly, indicating that Arg residues play a prominent role in mediating platelet adhesion to Alb. These results provide deeper insight into the molecular mechanisms that mediate the interactions of platelets with adsorbed proteins, and how to control these interactions to improve the blood compatibility of biomaterials for cardiovascular applications.

Despite exposure to elevated temperatures, Salmonella was detected by enrichment culture in sub-surface samples following 14 days of composting. In surface samples, pathogen surrogates were detected in the summer after 4 days of composting by enrichment culture only, whereas E. coli O157:H7 and L. innocua remained detectable by direct plating (>2log(10) cfu/g) up to 28 days in piles composted during the fall and winter. All three types of bacteria remained detectable by enrichment culture in surface samples composted for 56 days during the winter. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition to market revenue and market demand, the parameters of a negotiated contract can also play a role in market selection and fulfillment decisions. Two such parameters are (1) delivery obligation penalties and (2) delivery charges. In this paper, we determine optimal solution approaches for problem settings when either of these contract parameters is present.

The initialization step in the algorithm involves parameter choices that bound the degree of the interpolating polynomial and hence the length of the list of codewords generated. In this paper, we use simple properties of discriminants of polynomials over finite fields to provide improved parameter choices for the Guruswami-Sudan list decoding algorithm for algebraic geometry codes. As a consequence, we obtain a better bound on the list size as well as a lower degree interpolating polynomial.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0925-1022			WOS:000273310600007

Periodic reviews focus future research and inform conservation and management; here, we take advantage of our combined experiences working on Western Hemisphere avian migration systems to highlight recent lessons and critical gaps in knowledge. Among topics discussed are: (1) The pipeline from pure to applied researchers leaves room for improvement. (2) Population limitation and regulation includes both seasonal and between-season interactions. (3) The study of movements of small-bodied species remains a major research frontier. (4) We must increase our understanding of population connectivity. (5) With few exceptions, population regulation has barely been investigated. (6) We have increasingly integrated landscape configuration of habitats, large-scale habitat disturbances, and habitat quality impacts into models of seasonal and overall demographic success. (7) The post-breeding season (late summer for latitudinal migrants) is increasingly appreciated for its impacts on demography. (8) We recognize the diverse ways that avian brood parasites, nest predators, and food availability affect demography. (9) Source-sink and meta-population models help us understand migratory avian distributions among fragmented habitats. (10) Advances in modeling have improved estimates of annual survival and fecundity, but for few species. (11) Populations can be limited by ecological conditions in winter, but habitat needs are poorly known for most species at this time. (12) Migration tends to occupy broad spatial fronts that may change seasonally or when migrants cross major barriers. (13) En route conditions can limit migrant populations; linking migration habitat quality indicators to fitness or population consequences presents a major challenge. (14) A variety of intra-tropical Neotropical migration patterns are recognizable,. but almost nothing is known about these systems beyond descriptions of a few typical species' movements. (15) Global climate change scenarios predict range and phenology shifts of Neotropical migrant bird populations that must be considered in conservation plans. Future studies will depend on new technologies and the integration of modeling with sophisticated, large-spatial-scale measurement and parameter estimation; whether the pace of research and management involving migratory birds can match the growth of environmental threats remains to be seen.									113	2	0	110	0	118			0012-9615	1557-7015		WOS:000275816800002

The COMMA-D beta-geo (CD beta geo) mouse mammary cell line displays characteristics of normal mammary progenitor cells including the ability to regenerate a mammary gland when transplanted into the cleared fat pad of a juvenile mouse, nuclear label retention, and the capacity to form anchorage-independent mammospheres. We demonstrate that AREG is essential for formation of floating mammospheres by CD beta geo cells and that the mitogen activated protein kinase signaling pathway is involved in AREG-mediated mammosphere formation. Addition of exogenous AREG promotes mammosphere formation in cells where AREG expression is knocked down by siRNA and mammosphere formation by AREG(-/-) mammary epithelial cells. AREG knockdown inhibits mammosphere formation by duct-limited mammary progenitor cells but not lobule-limited mammary progenitor cells. These data demonstrate AREG mediates the function of a subset of mammary progenitor cells in vitro. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Fuels and Predicted Fire Behavior in the Southern Appalachian Mountains After Fire and Fire Surrogate Treatments								FOREST SCIENCE				56	1	SI		32	45					FEB 2010	2010	This study tested the success of fuel reduction treatments for mitigating wildfire behavior in an area that has had little previous research on fire, the southern Appalachian Mountains. A secondary objective of treatments was to restore the community to an open woodland condition. Three blocks of four treatments were installed in a mature hardwood forest in western North Carolina. Fuel reduction treatments included chainsaw felling of small trees and shrubs (mechanical treatment), two prescribed fires 3 years apart, a combination of mechanical and burning treatments, and an untreated control. Mechanical treatment eliminated vertical fuels but without prescribed burning; the mechanical treatment added litter (11%) and woody fuels (1 hour 167%; 10 hours 78%) that increased several measures of BehavePlus4-simulated fire behavior (rate of spread, flame length, spread distance, and area burned) for 5 years. Prescribed burning reduced litter mass by 80% and reduced all simulated fire behavior variables for 1 year but had no residual effect by the third year. The combined mechanical and burning treatments had hot prescribed fires (mean temperature of 517 degrees C at 30 cm aboveground) during the first burn that killed some overstory trees, resulting in increased amounts of woody fuels on the forest floor. All active treatments (fire, mechanical, and combined) reduced simulated wildfire behavior, even after a severe ice storm that added fine fuels. Prescribed burning in combination with the mechanical treatment was the most effective in reducing all measures of fire behavior and advancing restoration objectives. Each of the active treatments tested must be repeated to reduce fuels and lower wildfire behavior, but prescribed burning must be repeated frequently. FOR.

Fuel reduction treatments included prescribed burning (B), a mechanical treatment (M), mechanical treatment followed by prescribed burning (MB), and an untreated control (C). Treatment effects on herpetofauna response variables were predicted by the direct and indirect effects of stand basal area, coarse woody debris volume, native herb cover, and forest floor depth. Path models were solved for lizard, snake, and reptile response to fuel reduction treatments. Lizard and reptile abundance were higher in B and MB plots than in C and M plots. Increasing native herb cover best predicted lizard and reptile abundance within B and MB plots. Native herb cover, lizard, and reptile abundance were highest in B and MB plots, and each of these response variables responded positively to B and MB. FOR.

Transgenic plum (Prunus domestica var. 'Stanley') lines (4,1 and 41) expressing GAFP-I exhibit enhanced disease resistance to the stramenopile pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi and the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita. Rootstocks created from such transgenic lines might be more readily accepted by consumers if it can be shorn that foreign gene products are not migrating into a grafted, nontransgenic scion on which fruit is produced. In this study, wild-type (WT) plum tissue as budded onto transgenic plum lines 4J and 41 to create chimeric-grafted trees. Tissues from chimeric-grafted trees were analyzed for gafp-1 transcripts (leaf and root) and protein (leaf, soft shoot, and root) by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunodetection, respectively. Transcripts of gafp-1 were detected consistently in the root tissues but not within the leaves of the grafted, WT scions. Similarly, the GAFP-I lectin was identified within the roots, but not in the soft shoot or leaf tissues of the grafted, WT scions. These results suggest that gafp-1 mRNA and protein are not moving into the WT scion tissues of chimeric-grafted plum trees.									6	0	0	4	0	6			0018-5345			WOS:000275314300001

Active Control of Microinterferometers for Low-Noise Parallel Operation								IEEE-ASME TRANSACTIONS ON MECHATRONICS				15	1			1	8		10.1109/TMECH.2009.2011897			FEB 2010	2010	Active control of phase-sensitive interferometric metrology systems is necessary for low noise, high resolution, high bandwidth, and parallel operation. Conventional active control methods have several drawbacks like low SNR, high complexity, and low bandwidth. With the development of micromachined scanning grating interferometers (mu SGIs), high-bandwidth parallel active control of an array of interferometers is feasible. This paper introduces a novel "recurrent-calibration-based active control algorithm." Utilizing the high-bandwidth integrated electrostatic actuator, this algorithm splits the calibration of the optics and the displacement measurement in time to achieve better noise reduction. The novel algorithm is implemented digitally using a field-programmable gate array on an array of mu SGIs simultaneously. Nonlinearity and the limited range of actuation of the electrostatic actuator affect the performance of the active control. It is compensated by using a lookup table and a gain reversal algorithm. A system model is built to design and analyze the control algorithm. A mu SGI interferometer setup validates the model and control approach. The control algorithm reduces the vibration noise by 40 dB at low frequencies with a cutoff frequency of 6.5 kHz. The resolution of the mu SGI coupled with the control system is measured as 1 x 10(-4) nm(rms)/root Hz.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1083-4435			WOS:000271985100001

Advanced thermal management systems for internal combustion engines can better regulate the combustion process by harmoniously controlling the cooling system's actuators to obtain desired thermal conditions in a power-efficient manner. In this paper, a comprehensive nonlinear control architecture is proposed for transient temperature tracking in multiple cooling circuits, which builds on single-loop studies. An experimental engine and transmission cooling system have been assembled that feature a variable-position smart thermostat valve, two variable-speed electric pumps, variable-speed electric radiator fan, engine block, transmission, radiator, steam-based heat exchanger, and sensors. Representative experimental results are discussed to demonstrate the functionality of the multiloop thermal management system under normal and elevated ambient temperatures. The presented results clearly show that the proposed robust controller-based thermal management system can accurately track prescribed engine and transmission temperature profiles.									13	4	0	0	0	17			1083-4435			WOS:000271985100013

We show that by selecting the suitable film thickness and separation distance of beaming gratings, the intensity of the near field can be greatly enhanced by resonance, which leads to the increase of the beaming efficiency in the far field. Moreover, we obtain a nanocavity above the nanoslit by integrating a metal nanostrip with a conventional beaming structure. The resonance of this nanocavity can further enhance the near-field intensity and improve the beaming efficiency.									11	0	0	0	0	11			1943-0655	1943-0647		WOS:000285055400002		
J	Shen, Haiying; Xu, Cheng-Zhong								Elastic Routing Table with Provable Performance for Congestion Control in DHT Networks								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS				21	2			242	256		10.1109/TPDS.2009.51			FEB 2010	2010	Consistent hashing-based DHT networks have an inherent load balancing problem. The problem becomes more severe in heterogeneous networks with nonuniform and time-varying popular files. Existing DHT load balancing algorithms are mainly focused on the issues caused by node heterogeneity. To deal with skewed lookups, this paper presents an elastic routing table (ERT) mechanism for query load balancing, based on the observation that high-degree nodes tend to receive more traffic load. The mechanism allows each node to have a routing table of variable size corresponding to node capacities. The indegree and outdegree of the routing table can also be adjusted dynamically in response to the change of file popularity and network churn. Theoretical analysis proves that the routing table degree is bounded. The ERT mechanism facilitates locality-aware randomized query forwarding to further improve lookup efficiency. By relating query forwarding to a supermarket customer service model, we prove that a two-way randomized query forwarding policy should lead to an exponential improvement in query processing time over random walking. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the ERT mechanism and its related query forwarding policy for congestion and query load balancing. In comparison with existing "virtual-server"-based load balancing algorithms and other routing table control approaches, the ERT-based congestion control protocol yields significant improvement in query lookup efficiency.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1045-9219			WOS:000272951300009

For body-force-driven turbulence, we prove directly from the model equations of motion the following bounds on the time-averaged modified energy dissipation rate, <epsilon(alpha,N)(omega(alpha,N))>, and unmodified helicity dissipation rate, <gamma(omega(alpha,N))>, for the Nth model (N = 0, 1, 2, ...):<epsilon(alpha,N)(omega(alpha,N))> <= C-1(N+1)2(N+1) U-N(3)/L-N and vertical bar <gamma(omega(alpha,N))>vertical bar <= C-2 (N+1)2(N+1) U-N(3)/L-N(2).Here, N is the degree of the approximate deconvolution operator, U-N and L-N are global velocity and length scales and C-1 and C-2 are constants that do not depend on U-N.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0272-4960			WOS:000274088400003

Plant density, sugar concentration, and plant growth regulators (benzyladenine and ancymidol) were examined using four genotypes of daylily (Hemerocallis) to determine which factors most influenced nutrient use. Active nutrient uptake was observed for 11 nutrients (potassium, sodium, copper, phosphorus, iron, calcium, magnesium, manganese, boron, sulfur, and zinc) with lower concentrations in spent medium than in the tissue water volume (fresh-dry mass expressed as mL H(2)O). Two patterns of nutrient use were visualized by correlative analysis of nutrient uptake. Greatest growth lowered plant nutrient concentrations of potassium, sodium, phosphorus, iron, and copper in all genotypes, and luxuriant uptake was indicated with least growth. Potassium, sodium, iron, and copper concentrations in plant dry matter were equal to or exceeded what is observed in vigorously growing nursery plants. However, phosphorus concentration in plant dry matter was low enough to be considered deficient when compared to Hemerocallis plants in nursery production. With a second group of nutrients (calcium, magnesium, manganese, and boron), the genotype, "Barbara Mitchell" lacked active uptake and was deficient. Calcium concentration was low in all plants compared to Hemerocallis grown under nursery conditions ("Barbara Mitchell" was the lowest concentration) despite active uptake by the other three genotypes-"Brocaded Gown," "Mary's Gold," and "Heart of a Missionary." Magnesium concentration in these three genotypes was low enough in vessels with greatest growth to question its adequacy at high densities. Increased sucrose in medium reduced the dry matter concentrations of all tested nutrients. Plant growth regulators had less impact on nutrient use than genotype and plant density. Nutrient uptake may be an important physiological component of genotypic variation.									16	0	0	15	0	16			1054-5476			WOS:000274516500014

To increase the wealth of genomic resources for the genus we constructed publicly available bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries for Nasonia vitripennis and Nasonia giraulti. Libraries have 36 864 clones each, empty-vector contents of similar to 2% and average insert sizes of 113.1 and 97.7 Kb, respectively, representing 12 and 11 genome equivalents. The N. vitripennis library was used for genome sequence assembly and in efforts at positional cloning of a developmental gene. The genome assembly of N. vitripennis is currently composed on 6181 un-joined scaffolds. These BAC libraries can be used to identify and close regions between scaffolds of the genome assemblies of both species.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0962-1075			WOS:000273947400017	20167027

However, further investigation of the structure using energy dispersive x-ray analysis reveals the presence of two phases, PbSe and beta-Ag(2)Te, with identical lattice parameters. The total thermal conductivity of the formed alloy is remarkably low for a crystalline material, kappa(T)< 0.6 W/m K at 675 K, it is reproducible, and in addition, the compound has good mechanical properties.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0021-8979			WOS:000274517300036

Though increased conformity between TKR components has the potential to decrease wear the optimal amount and planes of conformity have not been investigated. Furthermore, differing conformities in the medial and lateral compartments may provide designers the opportunity to address both wear and kinematic design goal simultaneously. This study used a computational model of a Stanmore knee simulator machine and a previously validated wear model to investigate this issue for simulated gait. TKR geometries with different amounts and planes of conformity on the medial and lateral sides were created and tested in two phases. The first phase utilized a wide range of sagittal and coronal conformity combination to blanket a physically realistic design space. The second phose performed a focused investigation of the conformity conditions from the first phase to which predicted wear volume was sensitive. For the first phase, sagittal but not coronal conformity was found to have a significant effect on predicted wear volume. For the second phase, increased sagittal conformity, was found to decrease predicted wear volume in a nonlinear fashion, with reductions gradually diminishing as conformity increased. These results suggest that TKR geometric design efforts aimed at minimizing wear should focus on sagittal rather than coronal conformity and that at least moderate sagittal conformity is desirable in both compartments.

Catechin is a natural flavanoid implicated in the potential allelopathic interactions of Centaurea stoebe. However, recent studies have shown that catechin is highly unstable and not likely to accumulate in growing medium at phytotoxic concentrations. All previous studies that investigated the allelopathic potential of catechin assumed a continuous exudation of this compound by C. stoebe. Contrary to this, but similar to many other plant secondary metabolites, we hypothesized that catechin exudation may exhibit a pulsed pattern that could facilitate its transient accumulation. Further, we aimed at optimizing a more sensitive detection technique. We tested the hypothesis by quantifying the diurnal pattern of catechin release by C. stoebe in a hydroponic system. Using sample processing, based on a solid phase extraction technique, and more sensitive fluorescent detection parameters, we were able to quantify catechin in the picomolar range from the growing medium. Catechin exudation exhibited a possible diurnal rhythm with respect to light intensity, with the highest concentration at 6 h after exposure to sunlight. Catechin also was found to undergo a degradation reaction resulting in a transient abundance of pyrocatechol in our system.									17	0	0	16	0	17			0098-0331			WOS:000274711700008	20155499

J	Kendall, Todd D.; Tamura, Robert								Unmarried Fertility, Crime, and Social Stigma								JOURNAL OF LAW & ECONOMICS				53	1			185	221					FEB 2010	2010	Children born to unmarried parents may receive lower human capital investments, leading to higher levels of criminal activity as adults. Therefore, unmarried fertility may be positively associated with future crime. Alternatively, in an environment in which social stigma attached to nonmarital fertility is high, many low-match-quality parents will marry, and children reared in these families may actually be worse off than if their parents had not married. We explore these effects empirically, finding that over the long run unmarried fertility is positively associated with murder and property crime but that the degree of social stigma has affected this relationship. For instance, our results suggest that some marriages in the 1940s and 1950s were of such low quality that the children involved would have been better off in single-parent households; however, this finding is reversed for marriages in the 1960s and there-after-many marriages that would have benefited children were forgone.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0022-2186			WOS:000279387000007

Development of a Meso-Scale Material Model for Ballistic Fabric and Its Use in Flexible-Armor Protection Systems								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				19	1			22	39		10.1007/s11665-009-9419-5			FEB 2010	2010	A meso-scale ballistic material model for a prototypical plain-woven single-ply flexible armor is developed and implemented in a material user subroutine for the use in commercial explicit finite element programs. The main intent of the model is to attain computational efficiency when calculating the mechanical response of the multi-ply fabric-based flexible-armor material during its impact with various projectiles without significantly sacrificing the key physical aspects of the fabric microstructure, architecture, and behavior. To validate the new model, a comparative finite element method analysis is carried out in which: (a) the plain-woven single-ply fabric is modeled using conventional shell elements and weaving is done in an explicit manner by snaking the yarns through the fabric and (b) the fabric is treated as a planar continuum surface composed of conventional shell elements to which the new meso-scale unit-cell based material model is assigned. The results obtained show that the material model provides a reasonably good description for the fabric deformation and fracture behavior under different combinations of fixed and free boundary conditions. Finally, the model is used in an investigation of the ability of a multi-ply soft-body armor vest to protect the wearer from impact by a 9-mm round nose projectile. The effects of inter-ply friction, projectile/yarn friction, and the far-field boundary conditions are revealed and the results explained using simple wave mechanics principles, high-deformation rate material behavior, and the role of various energy-absorbing mechanisms in the fabric-based armor systems.									22	0	0	0	0	22			1059-9495			WOS:000273667600004

Characterization of the Interaction Effect of Crumb Rubber Modified Binders Using HP-GPC								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING				22	2			153	159		10.1061/(ASCE)0899-1561(2010)22:2(153)			FEB 2010	2010	There have been many studies investigating the properties of crumb rubber modified (CRM) binders, but few that have attempted to quantify the specific effects that the addition of crumb rubber has on asphalt binders. The writers previously identified two major effects that crumb rubber has on binders: interaction effect (IE) and particle effect (PE). The IE results from the diffusion of the light fractions of the binder into the rubber particles and the PE is due to the addition of particulate matter to the binder. This study focused on providing a further explanation of the IE by characterizing 36 CRM and three base binders using high-pressure gel permeation chromatography (HP-GPC). Comparison of the molecular size distributions of the different binders verified that the IE is, in fact, due to the diffusion of lighter binder fractions into the rubber particles. Additionally, the IE may provide a simple means to determine the compatibility of binders with crumb rubber.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0899-1561			WOS:000274013700005

This paper surveys and evaluates different approaches to defining complexity in design for the design problem, process, and product. Three fundamental aspects to complexity are identified, size, coupling, and solvability, and expanded with respect to the three elements of design, problem, process, and product. Alternative methods for measuring these characteristics of the design are based on computational, information, and traditional design views of complexity. A method of measuring size as it relates to complexity is proposed for measuring the information content of design. A second method is proposed for decomposing a graph-based representation of design that provides a measure of the interconnectedness as it relates to complexity. Finally, two methods are proposed for determining the solvability complexity of design based on the effort involved and the degree of freedom of design. These measures are developed specifically for parametric and geometric problems as found in the embodiment design, but these principles may be applied beyond this.

Comparative and Functional Morphology of Wing Coupling Structures in Trichoptera: Annulipalpia								JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY				271	2			152	168		10.1002/jmor.10788			FEB 2010	2010	Several orders of morphologically four-winged insects have evolved mechanisms that enforce a union between the mesothoracic and metathoracic wings (forewings and hindwings) during the wing beat cycle. Such mechanisms result in a morphologically tetrapterous insect flying as if it were functionally dipterous, and these mechanisms have been described for several insect orders. The caddisfly suborders Annulipalpia and Integripalpia (Trichoptera) each have evolved a wing coupling apparatus, with at least three systems having evolved within the suborder Annulipalpia. The comparative and inferred functional morphology of the putative wing coupling mechanisms is described for the annulipalpian families Hydropsychidae (subfamilies Macronematinae and Hydropsychinae), Polycentropodidae and Ecnomidae, and a novel form-functional complex putatively involved with at-rest forewing-forewing coupling is described for Hydropsychidae: Smicrideinae. It is proposed that the morphology of the wing coupling apparatuses of Hydropsychinae and Macronematinae are apomorphies for those clades. J. Morphol. 271:152-168, 2010.

As the potential impacts of P. parvum are relatively well known, especially its capability to severely affect fish, managers have sought efficacious, environmentally sound, and socially acceptable strategies for mitigating this noxious species. Laboratory testing was used to identify an effective algaecide for control of P. parvum from Texas, Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Cutrine (R)-Plus at 0.2 mg Cu/l significantly decreased the density of P. parvum in samples from all of these locations. Both copper sulfate and Phycomycin (R) were less effective for controlling the population growth of P. parvum. The predicted response from the laboratory study was confirmed in the field at the Arizona site. Strategic use of Cutrine (R)-Plus in larger water resources could provide toxin-free refugia to allow some fish to survive and repopulate the water resource when the golden alga infestation abates.									11	0	0	9	0	11			1093-474X			WOS:000274175400014

Distress classification has usually been performed by visual inspection of the surface of the pavement or from the data gathered by automated distress measuring equipment. Consistency in this process can be increased and subjectivity is minimized by using an expert system. A methodology has been developed that uses fuzzy logic for the categorization of distresses. An expert system was developed in C language using fuzzy logic for reasoning. The objective of the developed methodology was to use automated techniques for quick, efficient, and consistent classification for flexible pavement distresses using data from the automated distress measuring system. The developed expert system has been designed to be used as a module within a pavement management system. This will help to completely automate pavement condition evaluation and strategy development for maintenance and rehabilitation of pavements, thus eliminating subjectivity and inconsistency in the process. According to the experts, mostly highway officials, the differences between the actual measured data and results from fuzzy logic expert system approaches were well within acceptable ranges.									8	1	0	0	0	9			0733-947X			WOS:000273675600008

The theory of emotional solidarity can aid in explaining such an intimate relationship. Developing the framework from previous qualitative work, the purpose of this study is to formulate and validate scales corresponding to the constructs in Durkheim's theoretical framework of emotional solidarity. Following two initial stages of pilot testing, each scale is included in an onsite self-administered survey instrument, with 455 heads of household completing the instrument in a coastal South Carolina county.

Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a kind of mycotoxin produced by a number of fungi. In this study, OTA was extracted from longan fruit pulp by 80% methanol and then loaded on C-18 solid-phase extraction columns. The extract solution was then analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography - fluorescence detection (HPLC-FD) and an electron spray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), respectively. The HPLC-FD analysis showed that a compound similar to OTA might exist in longan fruit pulp, but further analysis by the ESI-MS method demonstrated that OTA was not present in the longan pulp, indicating that the presence of OTA in longan fruit pulp detected by the HPLC-FD analysis needed to be confirmed by the ESI-MS method.									3	1	0	1	0	4			1420-3049			WOS:000274929200009	20335938

These materials are playing an increasingly important part in a diverse range of applications, such as drug delivery, diagnostics, tissue engineering and 'smart' optical systems, as well as biosensors, microelectromechanical systems, coatings and textiles. We review recent advances and challenges in the developments towards applications of stimuli-responsive polymeric materials that are self-assembled from nanostructured building blocks. We also provide a critical outline of emerging developments.									1957	50	1	277	1	1979			1476-1122			WOS:000273810600012	20094081

Concise RLT Forms of Binary Programs: A Computational Study of the Quadratic Knapsack Problem								NAVAL RESEARCH LOGISTICS				57	1			1	12		10.1002/nav.20364			FEB 2010	2010	The reformulation-linearization technique (RLT) is a methodology for constructing tight linear programming relaxations of mixed discrete problems. A key construct is the multiplication of "product factors" of the discrete variables with problem constraints to form polynomial restrictions, which are subsequently linearized. For special problem forms, the structure of these linearized constraints tends to suggest that certain classes may be more beneficial than others. We examine the usefulness of subsets of constraints for a family of 0-1 quadratic multidimensional knapsack programs and perform extensive computational tests on a classical special case known as the 0-1 quadratic knapsack problem. We consider RLT forms both with and without these inequalities, and their comparisons with linearizations derived from published methods. Interestingly, the computational results depend in part upon the commercial software used. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Such comprehensive understanding of the nonlinear response and subharmonics analysis of these microcantilevers is, indeed, justified by the applications of piezoelectrically actuated microcantilevers that are increasingly becoming popular in many science and engineering areas including scanning force microscopy, biosensors, and microactuators. Along this line, the method of multiple scales is used to derive the 2x and 3x subharmonic resonances appearing in nonlinear flexural vibrations of a piezoelectrically actuated microcantilever. An experimental examination is performed in order to verify the analytical results. The analytical and experimental results yield the same system response for the fundamental frequency. In addition, the experimental results demonstrate the presence of subharmonic resonances that are supported by numerical simulations of the equations of motion. The experimental mode shapes of these subharmonic frequencies are also measured and compared with fundamental frequency.									16	1	0	0	0	17			0924-090X			WOS:000273594000002

The initial and latent survival of shovelnose sturgeon Scaphirhynchus platorynchus was assessed after exposure to a modified endoscopic technique designed to collect that biological information. Rather than inserting the endoscope through the urogenital canal or directly into the body cavity, we inserted a threaded trocar through a ventral incision and used a low-pressure air supply attached to the trocar to gently insufflate the body cavity. The initial survival of both experimental and control shovelnose sturgeon was 100%. Latent survival was 100% and 90% for the experimental and control fish, respectively. Our study suggests that incision endoscopy coupled with insufflation of the body cavity through the use of a trocar and an air supply is a safe and effective way to determine gender and examine the gonad developmental stage of shovelnose sturgeon. The short duration of the procedure and the high postprocedure survival suggest that this technique is suitable for shovelnose sturgeon and perhaps for the evaluation of other endangered fish species (e. g., pallid sturgeon S. alba) as well.									3	0	0	3	0	4			0275-5947			WOS:000277113900011

Factors Associated with Mortality of Walleyes and Saugers Caught in Live-Release Tournaments								NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT				30	1			238	253		10.1577/M09-003.1			FEB 2010	2010	We measured the initial mortality (fish judged nonreleasable at weigh-in), prerelease mortality (fish judged nonreleasable 1-2 h after weigh-in [which includes initial mortality]), and postrelease mortality (fish that died during a 5-d retention in net-pens) in 14 live-release tournaments for walleye Sander vitreus conducted in April-October 2006 and April-July 2007 in lakes and rivers in Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. Among the 14 events, initial mortality was 0-28%, prerelease mortality was 3-54%, and postrelease mortality was 0-100%; the mortality of reference fish (walleyes >= 31 cm long that were captured by electrofishing and held in net-pens with tournament-caught walleyes to measure postrelease mortality) was 0-97%. Mortality was generally low in events conducted when water temperatures were below 14 degrees C but substantially higher in events when water temperatures were above 18 degrees C. The mortality of reference fish suggests that capture by electrofishing and minimal handling when the water temperature exceeds 19 degrees C results in high mortality of walleyes that is largely the result of the thermal conditions immediately after capture. Mortality was not related to the size of the tournaments (number of boats), the total number or weight of walleyes weighed in, or the mean number or weight of walleyes weighed in per boat. Mortality was positively related to the depth at which walleyes were caught and the live-well temperature and negatively related to the live-well dissolved oxygen concentration. Surface water temperature was the best predictor of mortality, and models were developed to predict the probability of prerelease and postrelease mortality of 10, 20, and 30% or less of tournament-caught walleyes due to water temperature.									9	0	0	9	0	9			0275-5947			WOS:000277113900021

We have demonstrated in both pre-clinical animal studies and early clinical trials that dendritomas, highly purified hybrids between dendritic cells (DC) and tumor cells, Lire superior activators of anti-tumor immunity. It has been argued, however, that DC vaccines may be dysfunctional in lymph node migration. In the present study we examined inflammatory chemokine and chemokine receptor expression as well as other maturation induced genes in dendritomas produced from either immature or mature DCs in order to shed light on their capacity to migrate from injection sites to draining lymph nodes and elicit an appropriate immune response. RNA microarray analysis was used to identify gene expression profiles for inflammatory chemokines and receptors and other maturation induced genes within dendritomas, lysate-pulsed dendritic cells, immature DCs and mature DCs. Gene regulation was confirmed with relative quantification, real-time RT-PCR in a separate experiment. We found that fusion of immature DCs to tumor cells initiates maturation with respect to inflammatory chemokines, chemokine receptors and other maturation induced genes in a similar pattern as LPS matured DCs. Interestingly, we saw a reversed gene profile when mature DCs were fused to tumor cells. LPS matured DCs displayed the chemokine repertoire expected with DC maturation; however, once fused to tumor cells, these chemokines and other maturation induced genes reverted to levels comparable to immature DCs. It appears that mature DCs used for dendritoma production result in a de-mature genotype. Our results indicate that dendritomas from immature DC/tumor cell fusions may be more effective in migration from injection site to draining lymph nodes and, therefore, would be more effective in stimulating anti-tumor immunity.									3	0	0	3	0	3			1021-335X			WOS:000273873500033	20043120

DFT results are in excellent agreement with experimental data, which is currently available up to 80 GPa. Further, we predict the PE and PMP Hugoniots up to 350 and 200 GPa, respectively. For comparison, we studied two reactive and two nonreactive interaction potentials. For the latter, the exp-6 interaction of Borodin et al. showed much better agreement with experiment than OPLS. For the reactive force fields, ReaxFF displayed decidedly better agreement than AIREBO. For shocks above 50 GPa, only the DFT results are of high fidelity, establishing DFT as a reliable method for shocked macromolecular systems.									73	1	0	4	0	74			1098-0121	1550-235X		WOS:000274998000020

PLANT CELL AND ENVIRONMENT				33	2			272	289		10.1111/j.1365-3040.2009.02080.x			FEB 2010	2010	The Arabidopsis vacuolar H+-pyrophosphatase (AVP1), when over-expressed in transgenic (TG) plants, regulates root and shoot development via facilitation of auxin flux, and enhances plant resistance to salt and drought stresses. Here, we report that TG perennial creeping bentgrass plants over-expressing AVP1 exhibited improved resistance to salinity than wild-type (WT) controls. Compared to WT plants, TGs grew well in the presence of 100 mM NaCl, and exhibited higher tolerance and faster recovery from damages from exposure to 200 and 300 mM NaCl. The improved performance of the TG plants was associated with higher relative water content (RWC), higher Na+ uptake and lower solute leakage in leaf tissues, and with higher concentrations of Na+, K+, Cl- and total phosphorus in root tissues. Under salt stress, proline content was increased in both WT and TG plants, but more significantly in TGs. Moreover, TG plants exhibited greater biomass production than WT controls under both normal and elevated salinity conditions. When subjected to salt stress, fresh (FW) and dry weights (DW) of both leaves and roots decreased more significantly in WT than in TG plants. Our results demonstrated the great potential of genetic manipulation of vacuolar H+-pyrophosphatase expression in TG perennial species for improvement of plant abiotic stress resistance.									55	9	0	53	0	63			0140-7791			WOS:000273551100011	19930128

This article describes an attempt to bridge this gap. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) were synthesized using a chemical vapor deposition method and were dispersed in phenolic resin by both the wet and dry dispersion techniques before molding into composite bars (50 x 5 x 3 MM). Although no improvement in the mechanical properties of the MWCNT/phenolic composites was observed over the neat resin value when wet mixing dispersion was employed, an improvement of nearly 158% (160 MPa as compared with 62 MPa for neat resin) was achieved in 5 vol% MWCNT containing phenolic resin prepared by the dry mixing.

Influence of supplemental dietary poultry fat on the digestive and reproductive organ characteristics of commercial layers inoculated before or at the onset of lay with F-strain Mycoplasma gallisepticum								POULTRY SCIENCE				89	2			248	253		10.3382/ps.2009-00491			FEB 1 2010	2010	Effects of F-strain Mycoplasma gallisepticum (FMG) inoculation and 1.5% supplemental dietary poultry fat (PF) on the digestive and reproductive organ characteristics of commercial layers at 58 wk of age were investigated. Sham and FMG inoculations were administered at 12 (before lay) and 22 (early in lay) wk of age, and dietary treatments (basal control diets and basal control diets with PF) were initiated at 20 wk of age. Supplemental PF increased BW and decreased isthmal length relative to total oviduct length in hens. Various oviduct segments were also affected by the type and age of inoculation, and these effects were further influenced by the use of PF. In comparison to their time-specific sham-inoculated controls, infundibulum weight relative to BW was increased when birds were inoculated with FMG at 22 wk, whereas isthmus weight relative to total oviduct weight was increased by FMG inoculation at 12 wk of age. However, PF affected infundibulum length relative to total oviduct length only in sham-inoculated birds, and PF increased magnum weight relative to total oviduct weight only in birds inoculated at 22 wk of age (sham or FMG). Furthermore, PF decreased isthmus weight relative to total oviduct weight only in birds that were sham-inoculated (12 or 22 wk). In conclusion, the inoculation of FMG at 12 or 22 wk may increase the relative contributions of the isthmus and infundibulum, respectively, to the total mass of the oviduct. In addition, PF may decrease the relative length of the isthmus and increase the relative weight of the magnum in the oviducts of birds that have been inoculated at 22 wk of age (sham or FMG). Previous studies have shown 1.5% supplemental dietary PF to influence feed consumption throughout lay and performance early in lay in hens that were inoculated with FMG at 12 wk of age. However, the current results suggest that these influences are associated with gross changes in the oviduct but not the digestive tract of layers.									3	0	0	1	0	3			0032-5791			WOS:000273640500008	20075276

The setup uses a self-sensing piezoresistive microcantilever with nanometer accuracy to abolish the need for a bulky and expensive laser measurement system. A basic model for the interaction dynamics of AFM tip and sample in the high-speed open-loop imaging mode is proposed, accounting for their possible separation. The effects of microcantilever and sample stiffness and damping coefficients on the accuracy of imaging are studied through a set of frequency-domain simulations. To improve the speed of operation, a Lyapunov-based robust adaptive control law is used for the AFM XY scanning stage. It is shown that the proposed controller overcomes the frequency limits of the PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controllers typically used in AFM. Finally, the paper presents a set of experiments on a standard calibration sample with 200 nm stepped topography, indicating accurate imaging up to the scanning frequency of 30 Hz.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0034-6748			WOS:000275028400189	20192502

Effects of Kudzu (Pueraria montana) Solarization on the Chemistry of an Upper Piedmont South Carolina Soil								SOIL SCIENCE				175	2			61	71		10.1097/SS.0b013e3181ce5a5e			FEB 2010	2010	Soil solarization has been shown previously to be effective for eradicating kudzu (Pueraria montana) from small and/or environmentally sensitive infested areas. However, the potential effects of different kudzu solarization levels on soil fertility have not been reported. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether different solarization treatments used to eradicate kudzu during two growing seasons would lead to different soil chemistry conditions, particularly those related to soil fertility, at different soil depths. The study was conducted on an Upper Piedmont Cecil soil in replicated test plots that had been infested previously with kudzu and received varying levels of solarization from 2005 to 2007. A statistical model was developed to analyze the soil data based on the original randomized complete block design used for the solarization tests, and analysis of variance was used to determine if there were significant main effects or interactions between the two experimental factors (solarization level and soil depth). Fisher's protected least significant difference test was used to determine if significant differences occurred among specific pairs of means. Among the different solarization levels, some differences were observed for parameters related to the soil macronutrients carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) at different soil depths. In general, the two less intensive solarization treatments proved better at enhancing or preserving levels of C, N, and P in the soil and resulted in lower nitrate-nitrogen (NO(3)-N) concentrations. All three solarization treatments resulted in lower Na and Ca and higher K and Mn concentrations relative to controls. Taken together, it can be concluded that a less intensive level of solarization is optimal for both eradicating kudzu and preserving or enhancing soil fertility.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0038-075X			WOS:000274797300002

Traditional tissue engineering methods, however, face challenges in fabricating 3D tissue constructs that resemble the native tissue microvasculature and microarchitectures. We have developed a bioprinter that can be used to print 3D patches of smooth muscle cells (5 mm x 5 mm x 81 mu m) encapsulated within collagen. Current inkjet printing systems suffer from loss of cell viability and clogging. To overcome these limitations, we developed a system that uses mechanical valves to print high viscosity hydrogel precursors containing cells. The bioprinting platform that we developed enables (i) printing of multilayered 3D cell-laden hydrogel structures (16.2 mu m thick per layer) with controlled spatial resolution ( proximal axis: 18.0 +/- 7.0 mu m and distal axis: 0.5 +/- 4.9 mu m), (ii) high-throughput droplet generation (1 s per layer, 160 droplets/s), (iii) cell seeding uniformity (26 +/- 2 cells/mm(2) at 1 million cells/mL, 122 +/- 20 cells/mm(2) at 5 million cells/mL, and 216 +/- 38 cells/mm(2) at 10 million cells/mL), and (iv) long-term viability in culture (>90%, 14 days). This platform to print 3D tissue constructs may be beneficial for regenerative medicine applications by enabling the fabrication of printed replacement tissues.									114	2	0	73	0	117			1937-3384			WOS:000274125800016	19586367

Characterization of Ash-Basin Waters from a Risk-Based Perspective								WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION				206	1-4			175	185		10.1007/s11270-009-0094-9			FEB 2010	2010	The purpose of this investigation was to characterize waters in ash basins of coal-fired thermoelectric power plants and to identify constituents of concern from an environmental risk-based perspective. The investigation incorporated results from literature review and from laboratory analysis of ash-basin waters. General chemistry and concentrations of major and trace elements were investigated. Risk was assessed for aquatic life by a risk quotient approach using environmental exposure and toxic effects concentrations. The following constituents of concern in ash-basin waters were identified by the risk quotient method: aluminum, cadmium, chromium, copper, iron, lead, mercury, selenium, and zinc. In addition, pH was considered a constituent of concern because the observed pH range for ash-basin waters exceeded the range indicating reproductive impairment or mortality for sentinel species used for toxicity evaluation. The results of this investigation can be used to assess potential effects (reasonable potential analysis) for receiving system aquatic biota as a consequence of exposure to ash-basin effluent and applied to developing remediation strategies. The constituents of concern are readily treatable, and ash-basin waters can be potentially reused within a power plant or for other purposes (e.g., irrigation or stream flow augmentation).									2	0	0	1	0	2			0049-6979			WOS:000273755500015

Typical electrical resistivity values at 700 K are in the range similar to 4 m Omega cm <= rho <= 20 m Omega cm, while low thermal conductivity values (kappa < 1 W m(-1) K-1) were obtained. We find that the thermal conductivity of this crystalline alloy has a temperature dependence strikingly similar to those of amorphous solids. In addition the thermal conductivity, thermopower, and electrical resistivity decouple. This result makes it possible to optimize thermoelectric performance by minimizing the electrical resistivity. It is therefore envisaged that this system has potential as a high performance bulk thermoelectric.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0953-8984			WOS:000273055400024	21386296

Triple Recognition of B-DNA by a Neomycin-Hoechst 33258-Pyrene Conjugate								BIOCHEMISTRY				49	3			452	469		10.1021/bi9016796			JAN 26 2010	2010	Recent developments have indicated that aminoglycoside binding is not limited to RNA, but to nucleic acids that, like RNA, adopt conformations similar to its A-form. We further sought to expand the utility of aminoglycoside binding to B-DNA structures by conjugating neomycin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic, with the B-DNA minor groove binding ligand Hoechst 33258. Envisioning a dual groove binding mode, we have extended the potential recognition process to include I third, intercalative moiety. Similar conjugates. which vary ill the number of binding moieties but maintain Identical linkages to allow direct comparisons to be made, have also been prepared. We report herein novel neomycin- and Hoechst 33258-based conjugates developed Ill our laboratories for exploring the recognition potential with B-DNA. Spectroscopic studies Such as UV melting, differential scanning calorimetry, isothermal fluorescence titrations, and circular dichroism together illustrate the triple recognition of the novel conjugate containing neomycin, Hoechst 33258, and pyrene. This study represents the first example of DNA molecular recognition capable of minor versus major groove recognition in conjunction with intercalation.									38	1	0	27	0	39			0006-2960			WOS:000273618200007	20000367

The influence of coiled nanostructure on the enhancement of dielectric constants and electromagnetic shielding efficiency in polymer composites								APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS				96	4					043115	10.1063/1.3292214			JAN 25 2010	2010	We report through a comparison of the electromagnetic properties of polymer composites constituted of linear and nonlinear (helically coiled) carbon nanotubes (CNTs) that the electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding efficiency could be much increased in the latter. A higher ac conductivity and relative dielectric permittivity (both epsilon(') and epsilon(')) was recorded when coiled structures were used, and was ascribed to enhanced capacitive and electric field depolarization effects. The EMI shielding was related to the extended length/diameter aspect ratio of the CNTs. Our study has implications in the design of materials for EMI shielding, where nanostructure geometry could play a major role.									15	2	0	0	0	15			0003-6951			WOS:000274179900075

We show that the reflow process effectively decreases sidewall roughness of chalcogenide glass waveguides. A kinetic model is presented to quantitatively explain the sidewall roughness evolution during thermal reflow. Further, we develop a technique to calculate waveguide optical loss using the roughness evolution model, and predict the ultimate low loss limit in reflowed high-index-contrast glass waveguides. Up to 50% optical loss reduction after reflow treatment is experimentally observed, and the practical loss limiting factors are discussed.

Near-IR photographs of the OH layer are taken at two sites separated by a 645 km distance. Each photograph is processed in order to provide a satellite view of the layer. When superposed, the two views present a common diamond-shaped area. Pairs of matched points that correspond to a physical emissive point in the common area are identified in calculating a normalized cross-correlation coefficient (NCC). This method is suitable for obtaining 3D representations in the case of low-contrast objects. An observational campaign was conducted in July 2006 in Peru. The images were taken simultaneously at Cerro Cosmos (12 degrees 09'08.2 '' S, 75 degrees 33'49.3 '' W, altitude 4630 in) close to Huancayo and Cerro Verde Tellolo (16 degrees 33'17.6 '' S, 71 degrees 39'59.4 '' W, altitude 2272 in) close to Arequipa. 3D maps of the layer surface were retrieved and compared with pseudo-relief intensity maps of the same region. The mean altitude of the emission barycenter is located at 86.3 km on July 26. Comparable relief wavy features appear in the 3D and intensity maps. It is shown that the vertical amplitude of the wave system varies as exp (Delta z/2H) within the altitude range Delta z = 83.5-88.0 km, H being the scale height. The oscillatory kinetic energy at the altitude of the OH layer is comprised between 3 x 10(-4) and 5.4 x 10(-4) J/m(3), which is 2-3 times smaller than the values derived from partial radio wave at 52 degrees N latitude.

Pre-ozonation before chlorination resulted in enhanced HNM formation, producing trihalogenated HNMs as major species. Formation of THMs showed very a different formation pattern from HNM formation such that it was much higher in the raw than the treated water, and decreased after pre-ozonation. These findings indicated that precursors and formation pathways for HNMs and THMs are not the same. Increases in pH and bromide concentrations increased HNM and THM formation during ozonation-chlorination and THM formation during chlorination. The bromide effect shifted the formation of HNMs and THMs toward brominated species, with its impact being greater in the treated than raw water. On the other hand, there was no pH or bromide effect on HNM formation during chlorination. The presence of nitrite increased HNM formation under both chlorination and ozonation-chlorination conditions, but it had no influence on THM formation. HNM formation during ozonation-chloramination remained about 1 mu g/L level even at the highest bromide and nitrite concentrations. Monochloramination alone did not form any measurable HNMs. The results indicated that the use of chloramine can be an effective way to minimize HNM formation at typical drinking water treatment conditions.									43	5	0	38	0	46			0013-936X			WOS:000273433200041	20000680

The whispering gallery mode laser is generated in a polymer microring formed coaxially on the optical fiber. The focus of this paper is to determine factors that influence the coupling between the laser and the fiber around which it is formed. The coupling mechanism is analyzed and it is found that when the microring and the fiber are of elliptical cross section, there exists controllable coupling between the laser and propagation mode in the fiber. The coupling between laser mode and fiber mode is due to characteristics of Mathieu functions that describe the fields in elliptical waveguides. It is shown that the coupling between the laser and the dominant mode in the fiber can be optimized by the designing the dimension of microring, the eccentricity of the elliptical cross section, and the material contrast between fiber and microring.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0021-8979			WOS:000274180600004

Positive transport conditions were established at 650 degrees C using a single crystal of cubic zirconia as a substrate for growth of yttrium stabilized hafnia at a rate of 0.084 mm/week. During the study single crystals could only be formed with high concentrations of the stabilizer dopants by this method. This is the lowest synthesis temperature reported for any single crystal growth method of this refractory material. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Parasitoids are important regulators of arthropod populations, including major agricultural pests and disease vectors, and Nasonia is an emerging genetic model, particularly for evolutionary and developmental genetics. Key findings include the identification of a functional DNA methylation tool kit; hymenopteran-specific genes including diverse venoms; lateral gene transfers among Pox viruses, Wolbachia, and Nasonia; and the rapid evolution of genes involved in nuclear-mitochondrial interactions that are implicated in speciation. Newly developed genome resources advance Nasonia for genetic research, accelerate mapping and cloning of quantitative trait loci, and will ultimately provide tools and knowledge for further increasing the utility of parasitoids as pest insect-control agents.									388	18	0	390	1	460			0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000273629700047	20075255

We present herein various strategies to modify the surface of reticulated vitreous carbon (RVC) electrodes to suppress non-specific binding of biomolecules onto its surface. Non-specific binding and specific binding (SB) of two enzyme conjugates, neutravidin-alkaline phosphatase (NA-ALP) and biotinylated alkaline phosphatase (B-ALP), and also neutravidin itself, were studied using hydroquinone diphosphate (HQDP) as an enzyme substrate for ALP inside the pores of RVC electrodes that had been subjected to various modification schemes. The extent of NSB and SB of these biomolecules inside RVC pores was assessed by measuring the initial rate of generation of an electroactive product, hydroquinone (HQ), of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction, using linear scan voltammetry (LSV) for HQ detection. Electrodes functionalized with phenylacetic acid and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) showed low NSB and high SB (when biotin capture ligands were included in the modification scheme) in comparison with unmodified electrodes and RVC electrodes modified in other ways. A simple sandwich bioassay for neutravidin was performed on the RVC electrode with the lowest NSB. A concentration detection limit of 52 +/- 2 ng mL(-1) and an absolute detection limit of 5.2 +/- 0.2 ng were achieved for neutravidin when this assay was performed using a 100 mu L, sample size.

This paper uses the design and operation of a bushing tribometer to elucidate geometric effects that plague bushing systems. For example, the nature of the bushing edge has a dramatic influence on the performance of the system in practice where the system is necessarily over-constrained. it is shown mathematically that the torque requirements increase as the wrap angle of the contact spreads for a constant friction coefficient; at steady state the equation for calculated torque requirement is found. This is demonstrated using ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene bushings that showed increasing torques at decreasing clearances. A polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) bushing with 150 mu m interference initially required 50% more torque than a PTFE bushing with 350 mu m clearance. As the two different bushings ran into steady state wear, the torque asymptotically approached the mathematically derived value. The results of these experiments provide designers insight into the design of successful bushing pairs and the ability to tune frictional torques without changing material through the selection of clearance.

Measurement of risk perceptions in social research: a comparative analysis of ordinary least squares, ordinal and multinomial logistic regression models								JOURNAL OF RISK RESEARCH				13	5			571	589	PII 920294461	10.1080/13669870903172386			2010	2010	Drawing on data gathered in the 2006 Monitoring the Future study of American youth (n = 2489), this investigation offers a comparative analysis of ordinary least squares (OLS), ordinal and multinomial logistic regression models in examining the effects of multiple factors on perceptions of alcohol risk. The article addresses limitations of OLS models in risk analyses and demonstrates how scholars can avoid making statistical errors when positioning vague quantifiers as ordinal dependent measures. Substantively, the article finds differential effects for (1) sex, (2) perceived attitudes of peers toward alcohol consumption, (3) frequency of intoxication, (4) teacher efforts toward alcohol education, (5) frequency of communicating with friends, and (6) newspaper exposure, as determinants of alcohol risk perceptions. Through statistical results and visual displays, the article reveals how inferences made about these effects stand to vary depending on the regression method chosen.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1366-9877	1466-4461		WOS:000280056600001

J	Surasinghe, Thilina				Surasinghe, Thilina/D-5879-2012				The effects of climate change on global wildlife and terrestrial ecosystems.								Taprobanica				2	1			30	47					2010	2010	Climate change and biodiversity are interconnected, where climate change is reshaping global biodiversity. Unsustainable human activities that increase accumulation of greenhouse gases and hinder the natural balance of atmospheric greenhouse gases aggravate the effects of climate change on biodiversity. Rising seas-levels could inundate coastal habitats and stem the flow of nutrients from the ocean to the terrestrial ecosystems. Altered climate regimes directly affect wildlife, their behavior, migration, foraging, growth and reproduction. Climate change could disturb the dynamic equilibrium of terrestrial ecosystems by affecting ecosystem productivity, biomass production, hydrological balance, and trophic interactions. Further, climate change intensifies natural disasters and shifts in natural disturbance regimes. Such processes impose physiological and environmental stress on terrestrial ecosystems which adversely affect the ecosystem resistance and resilience. Moreover, warming atmosphere causes thermal optima to shift towards high latitudes and high altitudes. Terrestrial biota readily responds to temperature, where both flora and fauna alter distributions toward more favorable climatic conditions. Some climatic parameters that drive life history events, such as photoperiod, are fixed, while others, such as the timing of spring weather, are changing because of greenhouse gasses. The resulting mismatch between fixed and variable drivers of phenology, such as in mating, breeding, migration, hibernation, and post-hibernation activities, will disadvantage some species and benefit others. This will result in new ecosystems. Warming temperature favors biological activities of wildlife pathogens, since high temperature increases breeding rate, survival, hatching success and transmission of wildlife parasites and disease-causing agents. Climate change dissociates species interactions, mutual associations and a multitude of ecosystem functions. Ultimately, climate change predisposes native terrestrial wildlife to extinction and alters the functions and structure of terrestrial ecosystems. Biodiversity provides ecosystem services including the regulation and mitigation of the adverse impacts of climate change. Therefore, biodiversity conservation and terrestrial ecosystem management is critical to address climate change. Robust climate-oriented models with the use of GIS and remote sensing technology are needed to make effective predictions about the spatial and temporal effects of climate change.									0	0	0	0	0	0						ZOOREC:ZOOR14703025583

Insect Diversity in Switchgrass Grown for Biofuel in South Carolina								Journal of Agricultural and Urban Entomology				27	1			1	19					JAN 2010-2011	2010	Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) has tremendous potential as a biomass and stock crop for cellulosic ethanol production or combustion as a solid fuel. A three-year study was conducted to assess insect and weed diversity in a perennial switchgrass crop in Florence, SC. Insects were sampled from 2007 to 2009, using pitfall traps and sweep-nets. Collected specimens were identified to family and classified by trophic groups, and the predominant species were identified. The diversity and density of weeds in the field during the establishment year (2007) were greater than the following years. The ratio of dry weight of switchgrass to weeds increased from 2.4 in January 2008 to 15.3 in January 2009. Insect diversity at the family level varied significantly across sampling dates only for sweep-net samples, with diversity peaks in May of each year. Diversity at the trophic-group level showed significant differences for predators in pitfall traps and for predators and herbivores in sweep-net samples across dates. Diversity of herbivores in pitfall traps tended to decrease over time. Draeculacephala sp., Melanoplus sp., and a species of Tettigoniidae were the predominant herbivores, while Solenopsis invicta Buren was the predominant predator. Assessing arthropod diversity in switchgrass is a first step in identifying potential pest and beneficial insects in this crop.									2	1	0	2	0	2			1523-5475	2153-652X		BCI:BCI201200567543

We sought to map the relatively unexplored terrain of emotion work among volunteers and disrupt dominant disciplinary and lay notions of what counts as oreal work.o Narrative theory offered a lens through which to observe the interconnected nature of volunteers' stories, organizational and societal scripts, traumatic events, and conceptual narratives of emotion work developed by scholars. A narrative perspective, with its emphasis on how characters reckon with others across time and space, revealed the varied temporal nature (a priori, during, post hoc) of emotion work for volunteers. For River Valley volunteers, their status as unpaid workers shaped the nature of their emotion work prior to, during, and after calls.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1041-0236			WOS:000280546400005	20677047

Here we report a novel O(2)-sensing mechanism involving the C-terminus of the L-type Ca(2+) channel and regulated by PICA phosphorylation. In patch-clamped myocytes, oxygen deprivation decreased I(Ca) within 40 s. The suppressive effect of anoxia was relieved by PICA-mediated phosphorylation only when Ca(2+) was the charge carrier, whereas phosphorylated I(Ba) remained sensitive to O(2) withdrawal. Suppression of Ca(2+) release by thapsigargin did not alter the response of I(Ca) to anoxia, suggesting a mandatory role for Ca(2+) influx and not Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release (CICR) in O(2) regulation of the channel. Consistent with this idea, mutation of 80 amino acids in the Ca(2+)/CaM-binding domain of the recombinant alpha(IC) subunit that removes Ca(2+) dependent inactivation (CDI) abolished O(2) sensitivity of the channel. Our findings suggest that the Ca(2+)/CaM binding domain of the L-type Ca(2+) may represent a molecular site for O(2) sensing of the heart.					6th Larry and Horti Fairberg Workshop on Analysis of Cardiac Development, From Embryo to Old Age6th Larry and Horti Fairberg Workshop on Analysis of Cardiac Development, From Embryo to Old Age	MAR 30-APR 01, 2009MAR 30-APR 01, 2009	Rambam Med CtrRambam Med Ctr	Tech-Israel Inst Technol, Haifa, ISRAELTech-Israel Inst Technol, Haifa, ISRAEL	8	0	0	7	0	8			0077-8923		978-1-57331-747-4	WOS:000277731600020	20201898	
J	Quarles, C. Derrick, Jr.; Brumaghim, Julia L.; Marcus, R. Kenneth								Simultaneous multiple element detection by particle beam/hollow cathode-optical emission spectroscopy as a tool for metallomic studies: Determinations of metal binding with apo-transferrin								METALLOMICS				2	2			154	161		10.1039/b916073f			2010	2010	Particle beam/hollow cathode-optical emission spectroscopy (PB/HC-OES) is presented as a tool for the determination of metal ion loading in transferrin (Tf). The elemental specificity of optical emission spectroscopy provides a means of assessing metal ion concentrations as well as the relative amounts of metal per unit protein concentration (up to 2 moles of Fe per mole of protein). The PB/HC-OES method allows for the simultaneous detection of metal content (Fe (I) 371.99, Ni (I) 341.41 nm, Zn (I) 213.86 nm, and Ag (I) 338.28 nm in this case), as well as elemental carbon and sulfur (C (I) 156.14 nm and S (I) 180.73 nm) that are reflective of the protein composition and concentration. Quanti. cation for the metal species is based on calibration functions derived from aqueous solutions, with limits of detection for the entire suite being less than 1.0 mu M. Determinations in this manner eliminate much of the ambiguity inherent in UV-VIS absorbance determinations of Tf metal binding. Validation of this method is obtained by analyzing loading response of Fe(3+) into Tf using the PB/HC-OES method and comparing the results with those of the standard UV-VIS absorbance method. Maximum Fe(3+) loading of Tf (based on the number of available binding sites) was determined to be 71.2 +/- 4.7% by the PB/HC-OES method and 67.5 +/- 2.5% for the UV-VIS absorbance method. Element emission ratios between the dopant metals and the carbon and sulfur protein constituents allow for concentration independent determinations of metal binding into Tf. Loading percentages were determined for Ni(2+), Zn(2+), and Ag(+) into Tf with maximum loading values of 19.5 +/- 0.4%, 41.0 +/- 4.4%, and 141.2 +/- 4.3%, respectively. While of no apparent biological significance, Ag+ presents an interesting case as a surrogate for Pt(2+), whose binding with Tf has shown to be quite different from the other metals. A different mode from the others is indeed observed, and is consistent with conjecture on the Pt(2+) mechanisms. Competitive binding studies not easily performed using absorbance spectroscopy are easily performed by simultaneous, multielement analysis, reflective of the metals and the protein content. In this work, there is clear competition between and Fe(3+) and Zn(2+) for binding in the C-terminus lobe of Tf, while Ni(2+) binds within the N-terminus lobe. Addition of Ag(+) to this mixture does not affect the other metals' distributions, but reflects binding at other protein sites.

In this paper, we derive the equations of motion for Shoot-the-moon using an Eular-Lagrangian approach and explore its underactuated, nonlinear, nonholonomic dynamics. Two positon controllers are designed, one for a local linearization and another with nonlinear feedforward. Simulations of both controllers are performed, showing that the ball converges to the setpoint from its vicinity for the linearized controller, and that a continuous signal can be tracked with the feedforward controller. Simulation also demonstrates the effect of the nonholonomic constraint relating the ball's linear and angular position.

IEEE					Modeling and Analysis of a Weight Driven Mechanical Tower Clock								2010 AMERICAN CONTROL CONFERENCE		Proceedings of the American Control Conference						634	639					2010	2010	The tower clock has served European communities beginning in the 14(th) century and American towns since the 18(th) century. Although the early clocks acted as audible alarms, they progressed to feature time dials and synchronized melodies from struck bells. The mechanical tower clock consists of gear trains, escapement, pendulum, driving weights, large dials with hour/minute hands, and bell(s) with striking mechanism. These clock components offer excellent examples of fundamental engineering concepts and control system principles. In this paper, a Seth Thomas Graham deadbeat escapement tower clock has been investigated. A brief survey of the societal impact of horology technology has been offered to motivate the study. The general operation of a weight driven tower clock has been reviewed and the governing mathematical equations discussed. Representative numerical and experimental results have been presented and discussed to validate the model.

A need exists to introduce a cooling system to remove payload heat that offers acceptable performance and design packaging for harsh operating environments. This paper introduces a coolant rail augmented with phase change material heat sinks to isolate the payload and occupants from outside air and yet provide efficient, reliable cooling for the electronic equipment. A lumped parameter mathematical model has been developed for the payload area and then analyzed in hot weather climates. Next, a finite control volume analysis was performed to locate hot spots within the cooling system and accurately model the PCM heat sink. Representative numerical results will be presented and discussed to demonstrate the cooling capabilities. The proposed cooling system offers improved thermal conditions at reasonable power consumption levels along with redundancy to accommodate minor component failures.

A new technique is developed to optimize antiangiogenic therapy which minimizes the volume of a tumor and prevents it from growing using an optimum drug dose. To this end, an optimum desired trajectory is designed to minimize a performance index. Two controllers are then presented that drive the tumor volume to its optimum value. The first controller is proven to yield exponential results given exact model knowledge. The second controller is developed under the assumption of parameteric uncertainties in the system model. A least-squares estimation strategy based on a prediction error formulation and a Lyapunov-type stability analysis is developed to estimate the unknown parameters of the performance index. An adaptive controller is then designed to track the desired optimum trajectory. The proposed tumor minimization scheme is shown to minimize the tumor volume with an optimum drug dose despite the lack of knowledge of system parameters.

To ensure quality of cure with feedback control, the determination of target cure status remains a difficult challenge, particularly when the radiant source needs to move in space for automating the process. In this paper, the problem is cast as a distributed nonlinear state and parameter estimation problem whereby the system model is simplified and a dual extended Kalman filter is set up. This is then used to estimate the cure status on-line from the distributed temperature information captured by one or more infrared cameras. To demonstrate the use of the estimated cure status information for enabling cure level control, output feedback control is implemented with source intensity and the velocity of the moving radiant source as manipulated variables for altering the irradiance on the target surface.

The scheme relies on the estimation of the robot configuration obtained by analyzing online the images captured from a camera during the robot motion. In this way, provided that no fault acts on the camera signal, it is possible to have a complete detection, isolation and identification of the faults acting on the inputs or on the outputs of the robotic system, provided that the faults are distinguishable from noise. To determine the residual signals, which indicate the presence of faults, three different observers having input laws designed relying on second order sliding modes, are proposed in the paper. The first observer enables the sensors Fault Diagnosis (FD), while the other two observers are specifically designed for the diagnosis of actuator faults. Experimental tests are made on a COMAU (R) SMART3-S2 anthropomorphic rigid manipulator. To acquire the images from the workspace, an AXIS (R) 207 camera is employed.

This paper investigates a potential real-time methodology to integrate long-horizon preview information for plug-in hybrid vehicles. Equivalent Fuel Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS) is deployed as an instantaneous real-time minimization strategy with parameters adjusted by estimated future driving conditions and obtained either from Dynamic Programming (DP) or from a global ECMS. The preview information is decomposed into future road terrain stored as in-vehicle 3D maps and future velocity estimated from streaming or historic traffic data. We show that with estimated future information, substantial reduction in fuel use, up to 13% is possible compared with a rule-based control strategy without any preview. Further improvement of fuel consumption on the order of 1% could be achieved with exact future information.

IEEE					Post-Bioprinting Processing Methods to Improve Cell Viability and Pattern Fidelity in Heterogeneous Tissue Test Systems								2010 ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)		IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings						259	262		10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627467			2010	2010	Bioprinted tissue test systems show promise as a powerful tool for studying cell-cell interaction in heterogeneous, tissue-like co-culture. Several challenges were encountered while attempting to consistently fabricate samples with high viability and pattern fidelity. This paper evaluates four methods for processing samples after bioprinting but prior to adding media for incubation. These methods, composed of various combinations of three techniques meant to promote cell hydration, are evaluated with respect to sample viability and pattern preservation. In the best performing method, Hank's Balanced Salt Solution was applied immediately after fabrication and a collagen overlayer was applied one hour thereafter. The success of this method highlights the ability of the collagen substrate to absorb moisture, which promotes cell health without disturbing the cell's printed location. An addendum to the main study is an investigation of the limits of an HP26 print cartridge to deposit cells at a faster rate for the purpose of creating cell layers with densities that approach confluence.					32nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC 10)32nd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC 10)	AUG 30-SEP 04, 2010AUG 30-SEP 04, 2010	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS)IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS)	Buenos Aires, ARGENTINABuenos Aires, ARGENTINA	4	0	0	4	0	4			1557-170X		978-1-4244-4124-2	WOS:000287964000063

Given a sample it is important for the feature extraction method to extract a rich set of features that can be used for identity recognition. This form of feature extraction has been referred to as Type I feature extraction and for some biometric systems it is used exclusively. However, a second form of feature extraction does exist and is concerned with optimizing/minimizing the original feature set given by a Type I feature extraction method. This second form of feature extraction has been referred to as Type II feature extraction (also known as feature selection).In this paper, we compare two GEC-based Type II feature extraction methods as applied to periocular-based recognition, an exciting new area of research within the Biometric research community that to date has used Type I feature extraction exclusively. Our results show that GEC-based Type II feature extraction is effective in optimizing recognition accuracy as well as minimizing the overall feature set size.					2010 IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence2010 IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence	JUL 18-23, 2010JUL 18-23, 2010	IEEE; IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc; Int Neural Network Soc; Evolut Program Soc; IETIEEE; IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc; Int Neural Network Soc; Evolut Program Soc; IET	Barcelona, SPAINBarcelona, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4244-8126-2	WOS:000287375800036

A semi-structured interview guide based on the critical incident technique was used to elicit specific information relative to the research question, and constructivist grounded theory analysis was used to develop a preliminary theory. This study's significance lies in its unique focus on peer-led Black Greek-letter Organizations as potential influences on students' educational experiences in engineering. These organizations have rich histories of traditions, including a strong emphasis on high academic standards. Our work augments that of other studies in engineering education which focus on institutionally-run interventions and/or support programs such as minority in engineering programs.					40th Annual Frontiers in Education Conference40th Annual Frontiers in Education Conference	OCT 27-30, 2010OCT 27-30, 2010	IEEEIEEE	Arlington, VAArlington, VA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0190-5848		978-1-4244-6259-9	WOS:000287083200064

A low-complexity protocol for packet-by-packet adaptation can be obtained if receiver statistics that are developed during the demodulation of a packet are used to choose the code rate and spreading factor for the next packet. The design and evaluation of the protocol typically requires extensive simulations, especially for modern packet radio receivers that employ iterative decoding. We show that analytical methods based on Shannon capacity results greatly simplify the design of the adaptive protocol and provide good estimates of its throughput performance.

IEEE					Demodulator Statistics for Enhanced Soft-Decision Decoding in CDMA Packet Radio Systems								2010 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS		IEEE International Conference on Communications												2010	2010	Next generation packet radio networks will have far greater processing capabilities than current radio systems. We propose and evaluate decoding techniques that make use of such capabilities to increase the probability of successful decoding. We propose a metric derived from statistics collected during demodulation in a binary CDMA receiver. We investigate several methods to apply the proposed metric to the demodulator's soft-decision outputs prior to decoding. Our soft-decision decoding techniques are designed to mitigate the effects of interference from other signals in the frequency band. We compare the performance of our proposed metric to the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) metric, which requires that the mean signal level and noise variance are known for each bit position. Rather than attempt to estimate these parameters directly, our metric uses demodulator statistics and thus does not require pilot symbols or training sequences typically required by an LLR-based metric.					2010 IEEE International Conference on Communications2010 IEEE International Conference on Communications	MAY 23-27, 2010MAY 23-27, 2010	IEEEIEEE	Cape Town, SOUTH AFRICACape Town, SOUTH AFRICA	0	0	0	0	0	0			1550-3607		978-1-4244-6404-3	WOS:000290335600174

Use of the T-parameter method to rapidly estimate the statistical variation of crosstalk in cable harness bundles is outlined. Crosstalk is calculated by segmenting the harness into a cascade of equal length multi-conductor transmission lines (MTLs). Methods to test the influence of the statistical variation in wire positions, height, and number of twists are proposed using both T-parameter simulation and analytical methods. The analytical method uses the mean and variance of crosstalk estimated for fixed harness parameter values to estimate the mean and variance when parameters vary with known probability density functions. The analytical method may thus save additional computation time, since simulations are only required for a relatively small number of fixed parameter values. More importantly, the analytical method may give additional insight into the cause of problems. A comparison of the simulated and analytical results shows the analytical method can accurately estimate statistical variation for the parameters studied.

Using experimental and simulated data, Bayesian analysis of time-intervals (Bayesian (ti)) was compared with Bayesian and frequentist analyses of counts in a fixed count time (Bayesian (cnt) and 1.65 sigma, respectively). Experimental data were acquired with DGF-4C (XIA, Inc) system in list mode. Simulated data were obtained using Monte Carlo techniques to obtain a random sampling of the Poisson distribution. All statistical algorithms were developed using R (R Core Development Team, 2010). Detection probabilities and average run lengths for the three methods were compared. Bayesian analysis of time-interval information provided a similar detection probability as Bayesian analysis of count information, but was able to make a quicker decision with fewer pulses at relatively higher radiation levels. The relationships of the source time, change points and modifications to the Bayesian approach for increasing detection probability are presented.

Knowledge Syst Inst					Reasoning about Attribute Architectures								22ND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING (SEKE 2010)								165	171					2010	2010	When software architects create an architecture they must balance the tradeoffs inherent among multiple quality attributes. Often this is accomplished by optimizing the architecture for each quality attribute separately. These separate, attribute-specific architectures are then combined into one cohesive architecture. Combining the architectures involves considering how to combine different types of component relationships. We define a composition operator that combines component relationships by using properties of the reasoning frameworks for the attributes represented by the relationships. We conclude that the composition operator is sufficient to compose the attribute-specific architectures into a comprehensive architecture.					22nd International Conference on Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering (SEKE)22nd International Conference on Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering (SEKE)	JUL 01-03, 2010JUL 01-03, 2010	Knowledge Syst Inst Grad SchKnowledge Syst Inst Grad Sch	Redwood, CARedwood, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-891706-26-4	WOS:000391891600033

The global fuel minimization problem is converted to a finite horizon optimal control problem with an approximated cost-to-go, using the relationship between the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation and the Pontryagin's minimum principle. An onlinear MPC frame work is employed to solve the problem online. Different methods for tuning the approximated minimum cost-to-go as a design parameter of the MPC are discussed. Simulation results on a validated high-fidelity closed-loop model of a power-split HEV over multiple driving cycles show that with the proposed strategy, the fuel economies are improved noticeably with respect to those of an available controller in the commercial Powertrain System Analysis Toolkit (PSAT) software and a linear time-varying MPC controller previously developed by the authors.					49th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)49th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	DEC 15-17, 2010DEC 15-17, 2010	IEEEIEEE	Atlanta, GAAtlanta, GA	13	1	0	0	0	14			0743-1546		978-1-4244-7746-3	WOS:000295049105089

This effect is caused by multiple scattering and diffraction of the laser beam by the nanorods. Compared with spherical nanoparticles, magnetic nanorods are better suited for illumination applications because they are stable in a rotating magnetic field.

J	Kothapalli, Chandrasekhar R.; Ramamurthi, Anand								Induced elastin regeneration by chronically activated smooth muscle cells for targeted aneurysm repair								ACTA BIOMATERIALIA				6	1			170	178		10.1016/j.actbio.2009.06.006			JAN 2010	2010	Elastin breakdown in vascular aneurysms is mediated by cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha, which induces vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) activation and regulates their deposition of matrix. We previously demonstrated that exogenous supplementation with TGF-beta 1 (1 ng ml(-1)) and hyaluronan oligomers (0.786 kDa, 0.2 mu g ml(-1)) cues the upregulation of elastin matrix synthesis by healthy cultured SMCs. Here, we determine whether these cues likewise enhance elastin matrix synthesis and assembly by TNF-alpha-stimulated SMCs, while restoring their healthy phenotype. Adult rat aortic SMCs were treated with TNF-alpha alone or together with TGF-beta 1/hyaluronan oligomeric cues and the release of inflammatory markers were monitored during over a 21 day culture. Biochemical analysis was used to quantify cell proliferation, matrix protein synthesis and cross-linking efficiency, while immunofluorescence and electron microscopy were used to analyze the elastin matrix quality. It was observed that SMC activation with TNF-alpha (10 ng ml(-1)) induced matrix calcification and promoted production of elastolytic MMP-2 and MMP-9. However, these effects were attenuated by the addition of TGF-beta 1 and HA oligomer cues to TNF-alpha-stimulated cultures, which also enhanced tropoelastin and collagen production, improved elastin matrix yield and cross-linking, promoted elastin fiber formation and suppressed elastase activity, although the release of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was not affected. Overall, the results suggest that TGF-beta 1 and HA oligomers are potentially useful in suppressing SMC activation and inducing regenerative elastin repair within aneurysms.

Intra- and interspecific responses to Rafinesque's big-eared bat (Corynorhinus rafinesquii) social calls								ACTA CHIROPTEROLOGICA				12	2			329	336		10.3161/150811010X537909			2010	2010	responses or understand the functions of these calls. We tested the response of Rafinesque's big-cared bats (Corynorhinus rafinesquii) to social calls as a possible method to increase capture success and to understand the function of social calls. We also tested if calls of bats within the range of the previously designated subspecies differed, if the responses of Rafinesque's big-eared bats varied with geographic origin of the calls, and if other species responded to the calls of C. rafinesquii. We recorded calls of Rafinesque's big-eared bats at two colony roost sites in South Carolina, USA. Calls were recorded while bats were in the roosts and as they exited. Playback sequences for each site were created by copying typical pulses into the playback file. Two mist nets were placed approximately 50-500 m from known roost sites; the net with the playback equipment served as the Experimental net and the one without the equipment served as the Control net. Call structures differed significantly between the Mountain and Coastal Plains populations with calls from the Mountains being of higher frequency and longer duration. Ten of 11 Rafinesque's big-eared bats were caught in the Control nets and, 13 of 19 bats of other species were captured at Experimental nets even though overall bat activity did not differ significantly between Control and Experimental nets. Our results suggest that Rafinesque's big-eared bats are not attracted to conspecifics' calls and that these calls may act as an intraspecific spacing mechanism during foraging.									5	0	0	4	0	5			1508-1109	1733-5329		WOS:000285772400007		
J	Wheeler, Alfred G.; Skaftason, Johannes F.								Notes on the feeding behavior of Teratocoris saundersi (Hemiptera: Miridae) in Iceland: phytophagy, zoophagy, and adventitious biting								ACTA ENTOMOLOGICA MUSEI NATIONALIS PRAGAE				50	1			45	52					2010	2010	Host plants of the stenodemine mind Teratocoris saundersi Douglas & Scott, 1869 in Iceland include the grasses Agrostis Deschampsia cespitosa, Elymus repens, and Leymus arenarius (Poaceae), and sedges, Carex spp. (Cyperaceae). Specific host associations for T. saundersi in Iceland previously were unknown. Larvae and adults fed mainly on leaves and stems of their graminoid hosts; during cloudy weather, the bugs were observed in thatch beneath host plants. An adult fed on nectar from a flower of arctic sea rocket, Cakile arctica (Brassicaceae). Larvae and adults fed occasionally as predators or scavengers on small Diptera and pierced human skin. Observations on zoophagy further document the use of animal matter by species of Teratocoris Fieber, 1858, whereas adventitious biting by T saundersi is reported for the first time. The zoophagous tendencies of T saundersi might contrast with the feeding habits of stenodemines that are regarded as strict phytophages, for example, most species of Stenodema Laporte, 1833 and Thigonotyhis Fieber, 1858.									3	0	0	4	0	4			0374-1036			WOS:000279642900005

In this study, we compared the population structure and spatial patterns of six coexisting species of Acer (maple) in a large-scale 25-ha old-growth temperate forest plot in northern China with the aim of gaining insight into the coexistence of these congeners. A second-order spatial point pattern analysis based on the pair-correlation function was used to evaluate spatial patterns and examine intra- and interspecies associations among them. The abundance varied from 251 to 6609 individuals, but these species showed similar, distinct L-shaped size-class distributions. All six species were aggregated at small scales. The degree of aggregation of the three species with low abundance was in fact higher than that for the others at small scales. Aggregated patterns were also found for small and large trees at small scales. For spatial associations among the congeners, the goodness-of-fit (GoF) test revealed significant associations for only 10 of 30 species pairs, indicating no clear evidence for interspecific competition within them. In comparing the relationships among different size classes, we found no significant relationship for most of the analyzed species pairs. The GoF test detected significant associations for 6 of 20 species pairs among large trees of different species, 6 of 30 species pairs among small trees of different species, and 11 of 30 species pairs between large and small trees of different species. Based on a comparison of population structure, spatial patterns and associations, we infer that for these congeners there exists no significant difference in seed dispersal, competitive ability, or the requirement for specific topographic and light environments. Other factors (e.g., seed production and other habitat requirements) may contribute to the coexistence of these congeners and the trade-off between species commonness and rarity.

S	Katsanevakis, Eleni; Wen, Xuejun; Shi, Donglu; Zhang, Ning						ValletRegi, M; Vila, M		Biomineralization of Polymer Scaffolds								ADVANCED BIOCERAMICS IN NANOMEDICINE AND TISSUE ENGINEERING		Key Engineering Materials		441				269	295		10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.441.269			2010	2010	Bioceramics are an important subclass of inorganic, non-metallic biomaterials. Attributing to their bioactivity and the ability to form bonds with native bone, bioceramics are increasingly used in medical implants, especially for bone repair and regeneration. With chemical composition similar to that of native bone, hydroxyapatite (HAp), a type of bioceramics, may impart to biomaterial implants biocompatibility, osteoconductivity, as well as surface properties that are germane to osteointegration at the bone-implant interface. However, porous bioceramics are very brittle and have low fracture toughness and compressive strength, which limits their uses as bulk materials for orthopedic implants. Increasing their mechanical strength by reducing the porosity may prevent tissue infiltration, therefore, bone regeneration. In comparison, polymers may mimic the mechanical properties of native bone, however, may lack the appropriate surface properties to seamlessly integrate with natural bone. There is a critical need to combine the bulk properties of polymers with the surface properties of bioceramics in the design of functional scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. There are several ways to incorporate bioceramics on scaffold surfaces, including plasma spraying, sputter coating, physical adsorption, laser deposition, and biomineralization. Biomineralization, which allows easy fabrication of bioceramics under physiological conditions, provides an effective means to produce bonelike minerals, e.g., HAp, on scaffold surfaces. By following the cascade of biological mineralization in vivo, biomineralization in vitro on polymers may be achieved using several different methods, including immersion in simulated body fluid (SBF), alternative soaking in calcium and phosphate solutions, urea-mediated solution mineralization, enzymatic method, and direct incorporation of HAp nanoparticles into polymers. The uniformity, structure, and composition of the bioceramic coatings can be fine-tuned by governing bimineralization parameters such as composition and concentration of the immersion solution, immersion time, temperature, and agitation. A variety of surface modification techniques can be chosen to functionalize/activate polymer surfaces to facilitate biomineralization. In this review, the mechanism for biomineralization in vivo, different mechanisms and methods for biomineralization in vitro, surface modifications for enhanced biomineralization, polymers for biomineralization, and biomineralization for drug delivery will be discussed in details.									4	0	0	2	0	4			1013-9826		*****************	WOS:000280113700012

The PS-PBD colloid supported inks (PEG/PS-PBD/CB) exhibited reduced percolation thresholds and enhanced conductivities above that of the individually carbon filled (PEG/CB) and small molecule blend (PEG/tPBD/CB) inks. Based on the DC conductivity analysis, the percolation threshold of the PEG/PS-PBD/CB composites was 3.6 vol%. The electrical resistivity of the PEG/PS-PBD/CB ink is lower than that of PEG/PBD/CB ink with the same CB content in the percolation region by 8 orders of magnitude. The percolation reduction was attributed to the heterogeneous dispersion of conductive filler aggregates "bridged" by PSPBD colloids. The aggregated dispersion of PS-PBD colloids in the ink matrix was characterized by photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) which produced a red-shift at high concentrations, signaling the required proximity of PS-PBD colloids to form energy transfer complexes.

At nanoscales (< 100 nm), the properties of material depend on quantum confinements. The challenge is to integrate these unique properties of nanostructures into low-cost manufacturing. For material deposition, a photo-assisted monolayer deposition technique can provide nanomaterials with an ultra-low defect density. Epitaxial dielectrics offer the possibility of growing defect-free optical materials including compound semiconductors on silicon substrates. In this paper, we have also provided manufacturing directions that must be incorporated for developing the next generation of integrated photonics.

Incorporating low surface energy polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) into the PFCB polymer matrix produced enhanced hydro- and oleo-phobicity. PFCB polymers functionalized with POSS nanostructures include blends, copolymers, and block copolymers. For copolymers, trifluorovinyl aryl ether (TFVE) POSS monomers were prepared in good yields using an operationally simple corner capping methodology from commercial POSS trisilanols. The surface analysis of POSS functionalized PFCB polymer blends and copolymers using microscopy and optical profilometry showed the POSS structures produced sub-micron to nano-meter roughness that contributes to enhanced water and hexadecane repellency.					4th Silicones and Silicone-Modified Materials Symposium4th Silicones and Silicone-Modified Materials Symposium	SEP 10-14, 2006SEP 10-14, 2006	Amer Chem Soc, Div Polymer Chem Inc; Proctor & Gamble; Amer Chem SocAmer Chem Soc, Div Polymer Chem Inc; Proctor & Gamble; Amer Chem Soc	San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0097-6156		978-0-8412-2559-6	WOS:000305197500016

American Journal of Agricultural and Biological Sciences				5	1			32	36					2010	2010	Problem statement: Stink bugs were not major pests of cotton in the southeastern United States until cotton varieties containing Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) transgenes came into common use, enabling reductions in insecticide applications against highly destructive lepidopteran pests. To maintain the benefits of reduced insecticide applications, it would be advantageous to detect and target isolated populations of stink bugs before they rise to economically important levels. However, detection methods for these pests are less than optimal, and alternative methods are being investigated. One novel method of detection would be to exploit substrate-borne vibrational signals of these bugs. Approach: To develop an effective vibration detection method, substrate-borne vibrational signals produced by different species commonly occurring in the region must be characterized sufficiently to enable detection of these species in the absence of visual observation. In this research, substrateborne vibrational signals were recorded from the brown stink bug Euschistus servus. These signals were categorized by dominant frequency, duration, and repetition time using a Gaussian mixture model, revealing an assortment of "songs" in an acoustic repertoire. Results: Females of E. servus emitted two distinct songs while males of E. servus emitted four distinct songs. Results indicated that the repertoire of this species differs from that of other species in the same geographical location (southeastern United States) reported in previous literature. Conclusion/Recommendations: In conclusion, detection of pentatomid pests by their substrate-borne vibrational signals must include the parameters of each unique song of each species of stink bug to be detected, including those of the two female and four male songs of E. servus. The characterization of these songs will allow for the development of a monitoring system in the field using strategically placed accelerometers to detect stink bug vibrational communication and thus provide a density map of the location of these pests.									2	0	0	3	1	4						ZOOREC:ZOOR14609062777		
J	Thompson, Martie P.; Kingree, J. B.								Sexual Victimization, Negative Cognitions, and Adjustment in College Women								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH BEHAVIOR				34	1			54	59					2010	2010	Objectives: To determine if negative cognitions accounted for the associations of sexual victimization with depression and alcohol-related problems among first-year college women. Methods: Data were collected from 719 first-year college females. Structural equation modeling was used to test if negative cognitive schemas mediated the links between sexual victimization and 2 outcomes. Results: Sexual victimization was related to higher levels of depression and alcohol-related problems, and negative cognitions partially accounted for these associations. Whether or not the incident happened in a dating context did not impact on cognitions. Conclusions: Findings suggest that preventing negative cognitions might help offset adverse consequences associated with sexual victimization.									3	0	0	1	0	3			1087-3244			WOS:000291932500007	19663752

The Olweus Bullying Prevention Program (OBPP) is a comprehensive, school-wide program that was designed to reduce bullying and achieve better peer relations among students in elementary, middle, and junior high school grades. Several large-scale studies from Norway are reviewed, which provide compelling evidence of the program's effectiveness in Norwegian schools.

Socioeconomic change, natural and man-made disasters, and international migration are major influences on the integrity of society. In these times of global financial crisis, communities around the world are in danger of losing their intrinsic structure and protective factors. Connectedness or attachment to family and culture of origin correlate with reduced risk-taking behaviors and a reduction in family and societal violence, posttraumatic stress, addiction, depression, suicidality, sexual risk taking, and other chronic and/or life-threatening health problems and illnesses. Facilitating these families' cultural and community ties and enhancing their access to extended-family and community resources can thus be protective against trauma. These relationships foster resilience and reduce the short- and long-term effects of stress on families and communities. Targets of interventions may be individuals, families, or communities. Assessment of vulnerabilities, protective factors, goals, and resources encourages and facilitates collaboration across natural and artificial support systems. Such collaboration is important in building resilience rather than perpetuating vulnerability and long-term problems for individuals, their families, and the communities in which they live. The recent Kosovar experience in implementing the LINC Model of Community Resilience illustrates these principles, as applied in the context of substance abuse services and community rebuilding in the period soon after armed conflict.									13	0	0	1	0	13			0002-9432			WOS:000276851600017	20397999

Red Imported Fire Ant Impacts on Upland Arthropods in Southern Mississippi								AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST				163	1			54	63					JAN 2010	2010	Red imported fire ants (Solenopsis invicta) have negative impacts on a broad array of invertebrate species. We investigated the impacts of fire ants on the Upland arthropod community on 20 similar to 40 ha study sites in southern Mississippi. Study sites were sampled from 1997-2000 before, during, and after fire ant bait treatments to reduce fire ant populations. Fire ant abundance was assessed with bait transects on all sites, and fire ant population indices were estimated on a subset of study sites. Species richness and diversity of other ant species was also assessed from bait transects. Insect biomass and diversity was determined from light trap samples. Following treatments, fire ant abundance and population indices were significantly reduced, and ant species diversity and richness were greater on treated sites. Arthropod biomass, species diversity and species richness estimated from light trap samples were negatively correlated with fire ant abundance, but there were no observable treatment effects. Solenopsis invicta has the potential to negatively impact native arthropod communities resulting in a potential loss of both species and function.									12	2	0	13	0	13			0003-0031			WOS:000273144700005

Fat existing in milk acts as an inhibitor in the competitive binding interaction of melamine and anti-melamine in the presence of melamine-conjugated horseradish peroxidase. Thus, the calibration curve and sensitivity of competitive ODI CLEIA for the quantification of melamine in fat free milk were wider and better than those in milk containing fat. However, a centrifuge is not a good method for removing the inhibitor because a portion of the melamine is also removed with the fat. The incubation time (20 min) for the competitive binding interaction of anti-melamine and melamine in 20% milk diluted with PBS buffer of pH 7.4 was longer than that (10 min) in 100% milk even though the sensitivity of the former was better than latter. The limit of detection (1.12 ppb) determined in rapid ODI CLEIA (dynamic range: 3.8-125 ppb) for the quantification of melamine in 20% milk not containing fat was lower than those (6.3 and 9.0 ppb) calculated in relatively time-consuming luminol CLEIA and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Also, we expect that ODI-CLEIA (dynamic range: 62.5-2000 ppb) capable of directly quantifying melamine in 100% milk without any pretreatment can be applied as a new and simple method for rapid screening of melamine in milk.									24	4	0	10	0	27			0003-2654			WOS:000281007300036	20683522

The theorem, which is analogous to the Jackiw-Rebbi index theorem for the zero modes in mass domain walls in one-dimensional Dirac theory, applies to vortices with odd flux-quantum in a semiconducting film in which s-wave superconductivity and a Zeeman splitting are induced by proximity effect. The momentum space construction of the zero-mode solution presented here is complementary to the approximate real space solution of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations at a vortex core (Sau et al., arXiv:0907.2239 [17]), proving the existence of non-degenerate zero-energy Majorana excitations and the resultant non-Abelian topological order in the semiconductor heterostructure. With increasing magnitude of the proximity-induced pairing potential, the non-Abelian superconducting state makes a topological quantum phase transition to an ordinary s-wave superconducting state which no topological order.

In order to study SMC response to forces similar to those exerted during balloon angioplasty, an in vitro concurrent shear and tensile forces simulator has been developed. After 24 hr of exposure to cyclic tension (5%) and shear (0.1-0.5 dynes/cm(2)) following simulated angioplasty injury (12% stretch), rat aortic SMCs exhibited significant synthetic behavior. These responses included increased cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell hypertrophy compared to cells exposed to strain alone. While all SMCs exposed to dynamic stimuli (strain, strain+balloon injury, strain+balloon injury+shear) demonstrated a decrease in contractile protein expression, the injury group also exhibited significantly greater expression of the synthetic marker vimentin. These in vitro findings agree with in vivo events following balloon angioplasty and present a refined dynamic model to be implemented for better understanding of SMC activation and prevention of responses through pharmacological treatment.									11	0	0	9	0	12			0890-5096			WOS:000273050800024	19781909	
J	Xu, F.; Yang, C. -C.; Gomillion, C.; Burg, K. J. L.								Effect of Ceramide on Mesenchymal Stem Cell Differentiation Toward Adipocytes								APPLIED BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY				160	1			197	212		10.1007/s12010-008-8505-8			JAN 2010	2010	Proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha are well known to inhibit adipocyte differentiation. TNF-alpha triggers ceramide synthesis through binding of TNF-alpha to its p55 receptor. Therefore, ceramide is implicated in many of the multiple signaling pathways initiated by TNF-alpha. In breast tissue engineering, it is important to know how to modulate adipocyte differentiation of the stem cells with exogenous additives like ceramide in vitro. We hypothesized that stem cell adipogenesis could be retained in TNF-alpha-treated preadipocytes in which ceramide synthesis was blocked and that exogenous ceramide could inhibit adipocyte differentiation. We first studied the effect of ceramide synthase inhibitor, Fumonisin B2, on the adipogenesis of murine mesenchymal stem cells (D1 cells), treated with TNF-alpha. We then studied the effect of specific exogenous C6-ceramide on D1 cell viability and differentiation. It was found that 1 ng/ml of TNF-alpha significantly inhibited D1 cell adipogenesis. Cells treated with 5 mu M of Fumonisin B2 were able to undergo adipogenesis, even when treated with TNF-alpha. High concentrations of exogenous C6-ceramide (> 50 mu M) had an inhibitory effect, not only on the pre-confluent proliferation of the D1 cells but also on the post-confluent cell viability. High concentrations of C6-ceramide (> 50 mu M) also inhibited mitotic clonal expansion when D1 cell differentiation was induced by the addition of an adipogenic hormonal cocktail. C6-ceramide at low concentrations (10-25 mu M) inhibited lipid production in D1 cells, demonstrated by decreased levels of both total triglyceride content and specific fatty acid composition percentages. Genetic expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma and aP2 in D1 cells was reduced by C6-ceramide treatment. CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) beta levels in D1 cells were reduced by C6-ceramide treatment during early differentiation; PPAR. and aP2 protein levels were reduced at terminal differentiation. C6-ceramide at lower concentrations also decreased lipid accumulation of differentiating D1 cells. Our results suggest that ceramide synthase inhibitor retains the adipogenic potential of TNF-alpha-treated mesenchymal stem cells, while exogenous ceramide at lower concentrations inhibit the adipogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells. Ceramide, therefore, could be a modulator candidate in breast tissue engineering strategies.									11	1	0	8	0	12			0273-2289			WOS:000273159200018	19165630

However, their highly curved geometry can make the design and analysis of helical antennas that are part of larger complex structures quite difficult. A simplified model is proposed that replaces the curved helix with straight wires and lumped elements. The simplified model can be used to reduce the complexity of full-wave models that include a helical antenna. It also can be used to estimate the performance of a helical antenna without full-wave modeling of the helical structure.					25th International Review of Progress in Applied Computational Electromagnetics25th International Review of Progress in Applied Computational Electromagnetics	MAR 08-12, 2009MAR 08-12, 2009		Monterey, CAMonterey, CA	7	0	0	1	0	8			1054-4887			WOS:000277164600004

It has been demonstrated that urban runoff and point sources, such as effluent from wastewater treatment facilities, introduce organic pollutants and potentially endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) into the watershed. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential toxicological effects of EDCs that may be present in the Reedy River watershed using a set of biomarkers measured in indigenous fish to characterize the exposure and biological effects of these contaminants. Bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) were collected during three different sampling seasons (spring, summer, and fall) from several sites along the length of the Reedy River and from an unimpacted site at Lake Robinson. Fish were analyzed for xenoestrogenic exposure (estrogenic effect of bile extracts) and effects (vitellogenin production in juvenile fish), which were compared to the hepatosomatic index as a general health parameter. Samples downstream of Greenville, especially downstream of the wastewater treatment facilities, were found to have significantly higher levels of estrogenic activity in bile extracts, which correlated well with elevated plasma vitellogenin concentrations relative to the specimens collected in reference sites. The results provide evidence that bluegill in the Reedy River were exposed to elevated concentrations of xenoestrogenic compounds and that these xenoestrogens were bioavailable, resulting in biological effects.									3	0	0	4	0	4			0090-4341	1432-0703		WOS:000273665000018	19488802

From the start, V1647 Ori has been an enigmatic source that has defied classification, in some ways resembling eruptive stars of the FUor class and in other respects the EXor variables. V1647 Ori underwent an outburst in 2003 before fading back to its pre-outburst brightness in 2006. In 2008, it underwent a new outburst. In this paper, we present high-resolution K-band and M-band spectra from the W.M. Keck Observatory that were acquired during the 2008 outburst. We compare the spectra to spectra acquired during the previous outburst and quiescent phases. We find that the luminosity and full width at half maximum power of Br gamma increased as the star has brightened and decreased when the star faded, indicating that these phases are driven by variations in the accretion rate. We also show that the temperature of the CO emission has varied with the stellar accretion rate, confirming suggestions from modeling of the heating mechanisms of the inner disk. Finally, we find that the lowest energy blueshifted CO absorption lines originally reported in 2007 are no longer detected. The absence of these lines confirms the short-lived nature of the outflow launched at the start of the quiescent phase in 2006.									7	1	0	0	0	7			0004-637X			WOS:000272790400011

The detection of bursts at this early epoch of the universe significantly constrains the nature of GRBs and their progenitors. We perform population synthesis studies of the formation and evolution of early stars, and calculate the resulting formation rates of short- and long-duration GRBs at high redshift. The peak of the GRB rate from Population II stars occurs at z similar to 7 for a model with efficient/fast mixing of metals, while it is found at z similar to 3 for an inefficient/slow metallicity evolution model. We show that in the redshift range 6 less than or similar to z less than or similar to 10, essentially all GRBs originate from Population II stars, regardless of the metallicity evolution model. These stars (having small, but non-zero metallicity) are the most likely progenitors for both long GRBs (collapsars) and short GRBs (neutron star-neutron star or blackhole-neutron star mergers) at this epoch. Although the predicted intrinsic rates of long and short GRBs are similar at these high redshifts, observational selection effects lead to higher (a factor of similar to 10) observed rates for long GRBs. We conclude that the two recently observed high-z GRB events are most likely long GRBs originating from Population II collapsars.									26	0	0	0	0	26			0004-637X			WOS:000272790400012

J	Joshi, Hem; Moser, Bryan R.; Toler, Joe; Walker, Terry								Preparation and fuel properties of mixtures of soybean oil methyl and ethyl esters								BIOMASS & BIOENERGY				34	1			14	20		10.1016/j.biombioe.2009.09.006			JAN 2010	2010	Soybean oil was transesterified using various mixtures of methanol and ethanol at a constant molar ratio of alcohol to oil of 12:1 in the presence of 1 wt% potassium hydroxide catalyst at 30 degrees C for 60 min. The effect of mixtures of methanol and ethanol on percentage yields and fuel properties of soybean oil methyl and ethyl esters (SME/SEE) was studied. The formation of methyl esters was faster in comparison to ethyl esters, as evidenced by a molar ratio of methyl to ethyl esters of 1.7:1 in the case of a 1:1 mixture of methanol and ethanol. High yields (94.6-97.9%) were obtained for all molar ratios of reactants studied. The resultant SME/SEE mixtures prepared from a methanol to ethanol molar ratio of 1:2 or greater exhibited enhanced low temperature properties and oxidative stability, as well as superior lubricity in comparison to neat SME. All other ratios that contained a higher percentage of methanol displayed similar behavior to pure SME. These results indicate that the fuel properties of soybean oil-based biodiesel can be improved by substituting a portion of the methanol reagent with ethanol during transesterification, albeit at higher production cost as a result of the higher price of ethanol versus methanol.

Bioremediation of Hexachlorocyclohexane Isomers, Chlorinated Benzenes, and Chlorinated Ethenes in Soil and Fractured Dolomite								BIOREMEDIATION JOURNAL				14	1			10	27	PII 918443716	10.1080/10889860903463695			2010	2010	Groundwater at an industrial site is contaminated with hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) and -HCH (i.e., lindane) (0.3 to 0.5 ppm). Other contaminants in the 1 to 15 ppm range include 1,2,4-trichlorobenezene (TCB), 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB), 1,3-DCB, 1,4-DCB, chlorobenzene (CB), benzene, trichloroethene (TCE), and cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cDCE). The aquifer consists of a shallow layer of soil over fractured dolomite, where most of the contaminant mass resides. The objective of this study was to compare (1) anaerobic reductive dechlorination of the polychlorinated contaminants, followed by aerobic biodegradation of the daughter products (mainly DCBs, CB, and benzene); and (2) aerobic biodegradation of - and -HCH, TCB, DCBs, CB, and benzene, followed by anaerobic reduction of TCE and cDCE to ethene. Conventional wisdom suggests that sequential anaerobic and aerobic conditions are desirable for bioremediating sites contaminated by mixtures of polychlorinated organics. The results of this microcosm study suggest that a sequential aerobic and anaerobic approach may be more successful, although implementing this in the field presents some major challenges. In the dolomite microcosms incubated under aerobic conditions first (59 days), - and -HCH were biodegraded close to the maximum contaminant level for lindane; all of the aromatic compounds were consumed; and there was partial removal of TCE and cDCE (presumptively via cometabolism). The subsequent switch to anaerobic conditions (day 101) yielded reductive dechlorination of the remaining TCE; a significant level of ethene was produced, although some cDCE and VC persisted. In contrast, sequential anaerobic (393 days) and aerobic treatment (498 days) for the dolomite microcosms was ineffective in completely removing the aromatic compounds, -HCH, cDCE, and VC. For the soil microcosms, both treatment sequences were effective, most likely reflecting a greater abundance of the necessary microbes and electron donor in this part of the site.									3	1	0	3	0	4			1088-9868			WOS:000273477600002

Risedronate prevents early radiation-induced osteoporosis in mice at multiple skeletal locations								BONE				46	1			101	111		10.1016/j.bone.2009.09.002			JAN 2010	2010	Introduction: Irradiation of normal, non-malignant bone during cancer therapy can lead to atrophy and increased risk of fracture at several skeletal sites, particularly the hip. This bone loss has been largely attributed to damaged osteoblasts. Little attention has been given to increased bone resorption as a contributor to radiation-induced osteoporosis. Our aims were to identify if radiation increases bone resorption resulting in acute bone loss and if bone loss Could be prevented by administering risedronate.Methods: Twenty-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were either: not irradiated and treated with placebo (NR + PL); whole-body irradiated with 2 Gy x-rays and treated with placebo (IR + PL); or irradiated and treated with risedronate (IR + RIS; 30 mu g/kg every other day). Calcein injections were administered 7 and 2 days before sacrifice. Bones were collected 1, 2, and 3 weeks after exposure. MicroCT analysis was performed at 3 sites: proximal tibial metaphysis, distal femoral metaphysis, and the body of the 5th lumbar vertebra (L5). Osteoclasts were identified from TRAP-stained histological sections. Dynamic histomorphometry of cortical and trabecular bone was performed. Circulating TRAP5b and osteocalcin concentrations were quantified.Results: In animals receiving IR + PL, significant (P<0.05) reduction in trabecular volume fraction relative to non-irradiated controls was observed at all three skeletal sites and time points. Likewise, radiation-induced loss of connectivity and trabecular number relative to NR + PL were observed at all skeletal sites throughout the study. Bone loss primarily occurred during the first week post-exposure. Trabecular and endocortical bone formation was not reduced until week 2. Loss of bone volume was absent in animals receiving IR + RIS. Histology indicated greater osteoclast numbers at week I within IR + PL mice. Serum TRAP5b concentration was increased in IR+PL mice only at week 1 compared to NR+PL (P=0.05). Risedronate treatment prevented the radiation-induced increase in osteoclast number, surface, and TRAP5b.Conclusions: This study demonstrated a rapid loss of trabecular bone at several skeletal sites after wholebody irradiation. Changes were accompanied by an increase in osteoclast number and serum markers of bone loss. Risedronate entirely prevented bone loss, providing further evidence that an increase in bone resorption likely caused this radiation-induced bone loss. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Effects of warm mix asphalt additives on performance properties of polymer modified asphalt binders								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING				37	1			17	24		10.1139/L09-118			JAN 2010	2010	This study presents an experimental evaluation for the performance properties of polymer modified asphalt (PMA) binders containing warm mix asphalt (WMA) additives. The PMA binders with the additives were produced using two of the available warm asphalt processes (i.e., Aspha-min and Sasobit) and three PMA binders graded as performance grade (PG) 76-22. The warm PMA binders were artificially short-term and then long-term aged using the roiling thin film oven (RTFO) and pressure aging vessel (PAV) procedures. Superpave binder tests were carried out on the binders through the rotational viscometer (RV), the dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), and the bending beam rheometer (BBR). In general, the results of this research indicated that (1) the addition of the WMA additives into the PMA binders showed positive effects on increasing rutting resistance at high temperature (based on the high failure temperature values from the DSR Lest); (2) the PMA binders containing the additives were observed to be less resistant to fatigue cracking at intermediate temperatures compared to the control PMA binders (based on the G*sin delta values at 25 degrees C from the DSR test); and (3) the addition of wax additive represented a possible lower resistance on low temperature cracking (based on the stiffness and the in-value at -12 degrees C from the BBR test).									17	0	0	0	1	17			0315-1468	1208-6029		WOS:000274351100002		
J	Kinley, Brandon; Rieck, James; Dawson, Paul; Jiang, Xiuping								Analysis of Salmonella and enterococci isolated from rendered animal products								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY				56	1			65	73		10.1139/W09-108			JAN 2010	2010	The objectives of this study were to determine the current status of bacterial contamination in rendered animal products and to analyze Salmonella and enterococci isolates from the samples. One hundred and fifty samples were provided by various rendering companies across the United States, including the following meal types: feather, meat, meat and bone, meat and bone from poultry, poultry, and blood meals. The average pH of the meals ranged from 6.16 to 7.36, and the moisture content ranged from 1.9% to 11.5%. The total bacterial counts were in the range of 1.7 to 6.68 log(10) CFU/g, with the highest in blood meal and the lowest in meat meal. Enterococcus species were detected in 81.3% of the samples and accounted for up to 54% of the total bacterial counts in some samples. Both blood meal and feather meal were more contaminated (P < 0.05) with enterococci than other meal types, although all blood meals were from a single company. Salmonella was detected in 8.7% of the samples. Escherichia coli was not detected in any of the samples, but coliforms were detected in four samples. Among enterococci isolates, three were vancomycin resistant. Thirteen serotypes of Salmonella displayed 16 pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis has indicated that Salmonella contamination was not persistent in the plant environment over time. The D-values for the Salmonella isolates at 55, 60, and 65 degrees C were in the ranges of 9.27-9.99, 2.07-2.28, and 0.35-0.40 min, respectively. These results suggest that the presence of Salmonella in the finished products may be due to postprocessing contamination. This study has also revealed that the rendering industry has microbiologically improved its products since earlier studies were conducted.									9	0	0	6	0	9			0008-4166			WOS:000274352000009	20130695

Natural infection of an herbaceous host by Armillaria: a case study on Hemerocallis								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE PHYTOPATHOLOGIE				32	3			351	360	PII 926630966	10.1080/07060661.2010.508629			2010	2010	Symptoms of Armillaria root rot were observed on the herbaceous ornamental, Hemerocallis sp. (daylily), in a residential area in Walhalla, South Carolina, which was surrounded by dense, hardwood forest that also contained diseased hosts. Our objectives were to describe a natural occurrence of Armillaria root rot on daylily, a newly discovered host for the pathogen, and to characterize the Armillaria species involved. To characterize the Armillaria species collected from daylily, we used all available methods, including both traditional (sexual compatibility tests, basidiome morphology) and molecular (phylogenetic analyses of rDNA internal transcribed spacer, ITS, and intergenic spacer I, IGS-I) approaches. The presence of rhizomorphs in the topsoil of daylily beds and on the roots of symptomatic daylilies, coupled with our finding of identical ITS1 sequences among isolates originating from each of a rhizomorph, a daylily, and a neighbouring dogwood, suggests that Armillaria rhizomorphs had spread from native hosts to infect the daylilies. Basidiocarp morphology and basidiospore size best matched that documented for A. gallica. However, rDNA sequence analysis and sexual compatibility were not 100% conclusive. Phylogenetic analysis of ITS sequences revealed that the unknown Armillaria isolates were most closely related to A. calvescens and A. gallica. Analysis of IGS-I sequences was even less informative, grouping our isolates with A. cepistipes, A. gallica and A. sinapina. Sexual compatibility (mating) tests revealed that haploid isolates from daylily were compatible with three of the A. gallica tester isolates, but also one of the A. calvescens tester isolates. Our findings suggest a possible southerly distribution and expanded host range for A. gallica, and raise further questions about the Armillaria species concept as it pertains to the two closely related species, A. calvescens and A. gallica.									2	1	0	2	0	3			0706-0661			WOS:000281653500008

Even at AsM concentrations lower than 10 mu g L(-1), the MACF exhibited a considerably high adsorption capacity to As(V), whereas the RACF was ineffective even at an AsM concentration ten times higher to 10 mu g L(-1). The MACF was able to reduce AsM concentration below its maximum contaminant level regulated by the US EPA for drinking water in a wide pH range without formation of the more poisonous As(III). Kinetic experiments indicated that the diffusion of AsM within the pores of the MACF was more rapid than that of the RACF and that the surface reaction was the dominant step in the adsorption of AsM onto the MACE Compared with the RACF, the MACF had a wider applicable pH range from 2 to 8 for the AsM uptake. Besides enhanced AsM uptake, the MACF maintained its high adsorption capability to organic contaminants, such as phenol and humic acid. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The essence of this inquiry resides in the interaction of carbon nanostructures and cell membranes, regulated by the laws of molecular cell biology and the physiochemical properties of the nanostructures. Of equal importance to this inquiry is a description of cellular responses to the integration of man-made materials; yet, how cellular responses may invoke whole-organism level reaction remains unclear. In this chapter, we show three experimental studies, which may be beneficial to obtaining such an understanding. Among the reservoir of methodologies, which have proved of merit, we focus our attention on fluorescence microscopy, one of the most powerful and yet least invasive means of probing nanoparticles in biological systems. Especially, we present the method of fluorescence energy transfer induced between a lysophospholipid molecule and a single-walled CNT upon cellular uptake, and describe coating nanotubes with RNA and suspending fullerenes with phenolic acids for facilitating their translocation across cell membranes and shuttling between cell organelles. Finally, we comment on the perspective of using molecular simulations for facilitating and guiding such experiments.									8	0	0	4	0	8			1064-3745		978-1-60761-577-4	WOS:000276107100012	20422387

The crystal structure of dipicolinic acid was first solved in 1973, which confirmed its molecular formula of C7H5NO4, a molar mass of 167.119 g mol(-1), and the resulting composition of its constituent atoms (C, 50.31%; H, 3.02%; N, 8.38%; and O, 38.29%). Dipicolinic acid and its analogues are known to form many intriguing complexes with main group and other metal ions from as far back as 1877. The corresponding bis-acid (DPA), bis-ester (DPE), and bis-amide (DPAM) derivatives behave as tridentate ligands, which efficiently coordinate to various metal ions. This chapter will discuss the coordination chemistry of several metal complexes with dipicolinic acid, its analogues, and derivatives as ligands.									0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-60876-281-1	WOS:000284123800001

The mono-adducts were isolated and their H-1 NMR spectra showed that the addition occurred with high regioselectivity at the [6,6] bonds of the I-h-C-80 fullerene cage. Electrochemical analysis showed that the reductive electrochemistry behavior of these derivatives is irreversible at a scan rate of 100 mV s(-1), which is comparable to the behavior of the pristine fullerene species. The first reduction potential of each derivative is either cathodically or anodically shifted by a different value, depending on the attached addend. Bis-adducts containing EtOOC-C-COOEt and HC-COOEt addends were isolated by HPLC and in the case of Sc3N@I-h-C-80 the first reduction potential exhibits a larger shift towards negative potentials when compared to the mono-adduct. This observation is important for designing acceptor materials for the construction of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells, since the polyfunctionalization not only increases the solubility of the fullerene species but also offers a promising approach for bringing the LUMO energy levels closer for the donor and the acceptor materials.									33	0	0	5	0	33			0947-6539			WOS:000277635300019	20235246

After functionalization these nanostructures were soluble in aqueous solutions. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfo- phenyl)-2 tetrazolium (MTS) tests showed excellent cytocompatibility of all CNOs analyzed at 30 and 300 mu g mL(-1), so these carbon nanostructures can be safely used for biological applications. The first covalent functionalization of oxidized CNOs (ox-CNOs) with biomolecules, by using biotin avidin interactions is reported here. Multilayers were prepared on a gold surface by layer-by-layer assembly and the process was monitored by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Covalent binding of molecules to the short amine-terminated organosulfur monolayers was assessed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy using total attenuated reflactance mode (FT-IR/HATR).									25	1	0	4	0	26			0947-6539			WOS:000277635300020	20340115

Because they provide data that can inform decisions about curricular changes, or new pedagogies, the incorporation of new assessment strategies can play an important role in how educational and curriculum reform is carried out. Several recent developments in assessment have been tied together to investigate the benefits of using multiple assessment strategies in decision making about teaching innovation. These new tools include measures of student problem solving, metacognition, cognitive development within the chemistry content at the college level and evaluation of students in affective aspects of learning. Summaries of how these new tools may be combined and what measures arise from such combinations are presented.									23	0	0	2	1	24			1109-4028			WOS:000277702900004

Using a phenomenographical lens, we interviewed seven graduate students who had achieved Ph.D. candidacy and at least 3 full years of experience in the program. Inductive, grounded-theory analysis of the data indicated that the students focused on plagiarism and data falsification when speaking of scientific misconduct, and tended to view normative values as the opposite of misconduct. None of the students appeared to understand clearly the process of establishing claims in science. Instead, they believed that it was the advisors' roles to make final judgments regarding the validity of their data. Overall, the data indicate that the participants' impoverished conceptions of scientific ethics resulted from naive personal epistemologies of science, which, in turn, was partly due to their under-developed professional identities. We recommend that training in scientific norms and the nature of science should precede instruction involving case study analysis of misconduct or ambiguous scenarios.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1109-4028			WOS:000277702900007		
J	Kraft, Adam; Strickland, Amanda M.; Bhattacharyya, Gautam								Reasonable reasoning: multi-variate problem-solving in organic chemistry								CHEMISTRY EDUCATION RESEARCH AND PRACTICE				11	4			281	292		10.1039/C0RP90003F			2010	2010	In order to understand how students approach multi-variate problems, we report a study on the cues organic chemistry graduate students perceive from mechanism tasks, and the reasoning processes induced by those cues. We used the think-aloud protocol in interviews with sixteen graduate students as they worked on two types of tasks: one, in which they were asked to supply the remaining steps of a partially-completed mechanism, and another, in which they were asked to predict the product of a reaction. Our findings indicate that the students exhibited impoverished interpretations of the representations used in the tasks, and that this lack of representational competence cued students primarily to a case-based reasoning (CBR) approach. CBR allowed the students to reproduce mechanisms without understanding the underlying steps. Furthermore, the participants tended to adapt the task to the retrieved case instead of adapting the retrieved case to the task, thus reducing its efficacy. Rules-based reasoning (RBR), which the students used for about one-third of their attempts, was highly ineffective because it resulted in 'under-accounting' of the relevant variables in the tasks. Models-based reasoning (MBR), which was used the least often, was particularly useful for Task 1. However, we believe its reduced efficacy in Task 2 was due to the students' mental models having inadequate predictive capacity.									23	0	0	0	0	23			1109-4028			WOS:000283153100006

Graduate students' mental models of organic chemistry diagrams								CHEMISTRY EDUCATION RESEARCH AND PRACTICE				11	4			293	301		10.1039/C0RP90009E			2010	2010	As part of our investigations into the development of representational competence, we report results from a study in which we elicited sixteen graduate students' expressed mental models of commonly-used terms for describing organic reactions - functional group, nucleophile/electrophile, acid/base - and for diagrams of transformations and their mechanisms. The students had the greatest difficulty in articulating a verbal description of functional groups. Most of the participants conceived of functional groups as book-keeping devices for determining the changes that occur in a reaction. Their conceptions of functional groups lacked any indication of function. Furthermore, this lack of process-oriented thinking resulted in descriptions of reactions that were focused on structural changes with relatively little mechanistic information. Consistent with previous research in chemistry and other STEM fields, the students in this study exhibited an overall superficial approach in their explanations of the diagrams; thus limiting the information they could extract from them.									16	0	0	0	1	17			1109-4028			WOS:000283153100007

SUBJECTIVE PERCEPTIONS OF THE EFFECTS OF SUSTAINED PERFORMANCE UNDER SLEEP-DEPRIVATION CONDITIONS								CHRONOBIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL				27	2			318	333		10.3109/07420520903502226			2010	2010	In today's society, numerous situations arise in which sleep deprivation is a common occurrence. Subjective perceptions are a vital component to understanding the effects of sustained performance during sleep deprivation, as they may be the first indication of the effects of sustained performance or sleep deprivation on the individual. Using the theoretical framework of the Controlled Attention Model, this study examined the effects of 16 h of sustained performance under 28 h of acute sleep deprivation on perceived effort, motivation, and stress of 24 participants while completing a complex cognitive and a simple vigilance task. Perceived effort increased for both tasks, with higher effort reported on the cognitive than the vigilance task at the beginning of the experimental period, but with higher effort reported on the vigilance than the cognitive task at the end. Subjective motivation decreased for both tasks, with significantly higher levels of motivation on the cognitive than the vigilance task. Perceived stress did not change for either task. Results suggest that functioning under sustained performance and sleep-deprivation conditions affects subjective perceptions differently for cognitive versus vigilance tasks. The controlled attention model offers one means of understanding how different tasks could affect a person's subjective perceptions and ability to perform, in that different levels of controlled attention are required for the two tasks.

A range reduction technique often employed is called Feasibility Based Bounds Tightening, which is known to be practically fast, and is thus deployed at every node of the search tree. From time to time, however, this technique fails to converge to its limit point in finite time, thereby slowing the whole Branch-and-Bound search considerably. In this paper we propose a polynomial time method, based on solving a linear program, for computing the limit point of the Feasibility Based Bounds Tightening algorithm applied to linear equality and inequality constraints.					4th Annual International Conference on Combinatorial Optimization and Applications (COCOA)4th Annual International Conference on Combinatorial Optimization and Applications (COCOA)	DEC 18-20, 2010DEC 18-20, 2010	Univ Texas Dallas; Univ Hawaii Hilo; Natl Sci FdnUniv Texas Dallas; Univ Hawaii Hilo; Natl Sci Fdn	Kailua Kona, HIKailua Kona, HI	6	0	0	0	0	6			0302-9743		978-3-642-17457-5	WOS:000296483000007

The approach is based on a recursion method analysis of the Liouvillian. From this we derive the lifetime of a vibrational mode in terms of moments of the power spectrum of the Liouvillian as projected onto the relevant subspace of phase space. In practical terms, the moments are evaluated as ensemble averages of well-defined operators, meaning that the entire calculation is to be done with Monte Carlo. These insights should lead to significantly shorter calculations compared to current methods. A companion piece presents numerical results. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We give tests both confirming the predicted rates of convergence and exhibiting some shared limitations of both models. The experiments also show the discrete NS-(omega) over bar simulation has greater accuracy (Tables 3 and 4) at less cost (Table 2) and requires significantly fewer degrees of freedom (Section 1.1) than a comparable NS-alpha simulation. The experiments suggest consideration of adding grad-div stabilization and higher accuracy NS-(omega) over bar -deconvolution models as a next logical step. In fact, this combination produced accurate results (see Figs. 10 and 11) on the coarsest mesh (mesh 1) upon which all other methods, models and variants tested failed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, a critical disadvantage of the SA algorithm is its high computational cost. Therefore. it is the goal of this paper to investigate the use of the critical temperature in SA to reduce its Computational cost. This paper presents a systematic study of the critical temperature and its applications in the minimization of functions of continuous variables with the SA algorithm. Based on this study, a new algorithm was developed to exploit the unique feature of the critical temperature in SA. The new algorithm combines SA and local search to determine global minimum effectively. Extensive tests oil a variety of functions demonstrated that the new algorithm provides comparable performance to well-established SA techniques. Furthermore, the new algorithm also improves the determination of the starting temperature for the SA algorithm. The results obtained in this study are expected to be useful for improving the efficiency of SA algorithms, and for facilitating the development of temperature parallel SA algorithms.

The overarching goal of this research was to develop effective and affordable tools for detecting stink bugs and damage induced by stink bugs in cotton. A commercially available electronic nose (Cyranose 320) comprising an array of 32 carbon-black composite sensors was used for this purpose and its performance was evaluated under laboratory and field conditions. Volatile compounds emitted by stink bugs were confirmed to be trans-2-decenal and trans-2-octenal. Four of 32 sensors responded to volatile chemicals produced by bugs and showed responses (smell-prints) to pure trans-2-decenal that were identical to those obtained from stink bugs. Under laboratory conditions, internal boll injury (interior walls of bolls and locks with raised callus growths or obvious damage to lint and seed) was predicted 95% of the time and the presence of stink bugs 100% of the time. There was a strong correlation (R(2) = 0.95) between the number of stink bugs in a sample and the response of Cyranose sensors. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Annual Conference				2010				259	62		10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5627467			2010	2010	Bioprinted tissue test systems show promise as a powerful tool for studying cell-cell interaction in heterogeneous, tissue-like co-culture. Several challenges were encountered while attempting to consistently fabricate samples with high viability and pattern fidelity. This paper evaluates four methods for processing samples after bioprinting but prior to adding media for incubation. These methods, composed of various combinations of three techniques meant to promote cell hydration, are evaluated with respect to sample viability and pattern preservation. In the best performing method, Hank's Balanced Salt Solution was applied immediately after fabrication and a collagen overlayer was applied one hour thereafter. The success of this method highlights the ability of the collagen substrate to absorb moisture, which promotes cell health without disturbing the cell's printed location. An addendum to the main study is an investigation of the limits of an HP26 print cartridge to deposit cells at a faster rate for the purpose of creating cell layers with densities that approach confluence.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1557-170X			MEDLINE:21096750	21096750

The treatment and disposal of this excess bacterial biomass, also known as waste activated sludge, accounts for about 40-60% of the wastewater treatment plant operation cost. A different form of biomass with a higher value could significantly change the economics of wastewater treatment. Fungi could offer this benefit over bacteria in wastewater treatment processes. The biomass produced during fungal wastewater treatment has, potentially, a much higher value than that from the bacterial activated sludge process. The fungi can be used to derive valuable biochemicals and can also be used as a protein source. Various high-value biochemicals are produced by commercial cultivation of fungi under aseptic conditions using expensive substrates. Food-processing wastewater is an attractive alternative as a source of low-cost organic matter and nutrients to produce fungi with concomitant wastewater purification. This review summarizes various findings in fungal wastewater treatment, particularly focusing on byproduct recovery during wastewater treatment. This review also provides an overview on performance of fungal treatment systems under various operational conditions. Important factors such as pH, temperature, hydraulic and solids retention time, nonaxenic and axenic operation, and others that affect the fungal treatment system are discussed. Moreover, certain important practical issues such as bacterial contamination under nonaseptic operation are also covered. The goal of the review paper is to evaluate the feasibility of cultivating fungi during wastewater treatment for deriving valuable biochemicals.									25	1	0	18	0	26			1064-3389			WOS:000277518700002

Kinetics of iron oxidation upon polyphenol binding								DALTON TRANSACTIONS				39	41			9982	9987		10.1039/c0dt00752h			2010	2010	Polyphenol prevention of iron-mediated DNA damage occurs primarily through iron binding. Once bound, iron in the Fe(2+)-polyphenol complex autooxidizes to Fe(3+) in the presence of O(2). To determine the correlation between the rate of Fe(2+)-polyphenol autooxidation and polyphenol antioxidant ability, kinetic studies at pH = 6.0 in the presence of oxygen were performed using UV-vis spectrophotometry. Initial rates of iron-polyphenol complex oxidation for epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), methyl-3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate (MEGA), gallic acid (GA), epicatechin (EC), and methyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (MEPCA) were in the range of 0.14-6.7 min(-1). Polyphenols with gallol groups have faster rates of iron oxidation than their catechol analogs, suggesting that stronger iron binding results in faster iron oxidation. Concentrations of polyphenol, Fe(2+), and O(2) were varied to investigate the dependence of the Fe(2+)-polyphenol autooxidation on these reactants for MEGA and MEPCA. For these analogous gallate and catecholate complexes of Fe(2+), iron oxidation reactions were first order in Fe(2+), polyphenol, and O(2), but gallate complexes show saturation behavior at much lower Fe(2+) concentrations. Thus, gallol-containing polyphenols promote iron oxidation at a significantly faster rate than analogous catechol-containing compounds, and iron oxidation rate also correlates strongly with polyphenol inhibition of DNA damage for polyphenol compounds with a single iron-binding moiety.									35	0	0	22	0	36			1477-9226			WOS:000282808500030	20871896

In our definition, IWE occurs when an employee is ignored, excluded by or intentionally kept apart from other individuals or groups of individuals in the workplace and/or at work-related events. We find that being the target of IWE from one's in-group coworkers is negatively related to satisfaction with social rewards as well as perceived coworker trustworthiness. These relationships do not exist, however, when the source of IWE is from one's out-group coworkers. In addition, we examine the interaction between perceived IWE and actual levels of IWE. We find that the level of actual workplace exclusion moderates the relationship between an individual's perceived social exclusion and their supervisor's ratings of the individual's social undermining of others. Similarly, we find that the level of actual workplace exclusion moderates the relationship between an individual's perceived social exclusion and their supervisor's ratings of the individual's organizational citizenship behavior. Finally, we introduce and discuss the validation of two scales for the measurement of IWE. The first scale measures coworker IWE, while the second scale measures supervisor IWE.									2	0	0	0	0	2					978-1-60752-263-8	WOS:000279614800007

Here we use the afterglow detection statistics of the systematic follow-up observations performed with GROND since mid-2007 in order to derive the fraction of "dark bursts". We find that the faint optical afterglow emission of "dark bursts" is due to a combination of two components: (i) moderate intrinsic extinction at moderate redshifts, and (ii) about 25% of bursts at redshift >5.

Customers are becoming increasingly protective of the information they disclose. The prior research on information disclosure has focused on privacy concerns and trust that lead to intentions to disclose. In this study, we tread new ground by examining the link between intent to disclose information and the actual disclosure. Drawing from social response theory and the principle of reciprocity, we examine how organizations can influence the strength of the link between intent and actual disclosure. We conduct an experiment using 15 pieces of information in a non-commercial context that examines voluntary individual information disclosure. Our results indicate that by implementing a reasoned dyadic condition where the organization provides reasoning on why they are collecting particular information; individuals are more likely to actually disclose more information. The results open up opportunities to go beyond intent, and study the actual disclosure of sensitive information. Organizations can use the concept of reciprocity to enhance the design of information acquisition systems. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We estimate the effects of bonuses, deployment, and stop-loss on re-enlistment between FY 2002 and 2006. We estimate that the baseline propensity to re-enlist fell by 20%. However, we find that deployed soldiers are more likely to re-enlist and that the estimated effects of re-enlistment bonuses are similar to those estimated in peacetime. We evaluate the reasons for our findings, and calculate the cost effectiveness of re-enlistment bonuses.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1024-2694			WOS:000285345800007

Such criteria describe the intactness of nanoparticle/substrate pair. The effects of cluster material and manipulation speed on the success of the process are investigated by atomistic simulations. Such qualitative simulation studies can evaluate the level of success of manipulation regarding different working conditions before consuming high experimental expenses.

Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is the most widespread application of microcantilever beam as a sensor, which is usually influenced by the tip-sample interaction force For this, vibration of AFM microcantilever probe is analyzed in this paper. along with analytical, numerical and experimental investigation of the influence of the sample interaction force on the microcantilever vibration Nonlinear integro-partial equation of microcantilever vibration subject to the tip-sample interaction is then derived and numerically simulated Moreover, multiple time scales method is utilized to estimate the tip amplitude while it is vibrating near the sample An experimental setup is developed using AFM in order to validate the theoretical and simulation results. Hysteresis, instability and amplitude drop can be identified in the experimental curves inside the particle attraction domain. These are likely related to the interaction force between the tip and sample as well as the presence of the water layer during the experiments. A fair agreement is observed between the theoretical analysis, numerical simulation and experimental findings which obviously demonstrates the effectiveness and applicability of the developed model.

Using the conventional actuation methods such as base excitation, the ratio of stiffness over the layer mass per unit length affects the resonant frequencies of the system as a single parameter. However, due to tip/sample elastic contact in PFM, these two parameters can be separately identified using the frequency shifts before and after attaching the layer. The concept is theoretically proven here using the modal analysis of the system. For practical verification, three gold-coated AFM microcantilevers were primarily tested for their initial resonant frequencies. The Focused Ion Beam (FIB) technique was then employed to deposit thin layers of Pt-based material in different configurations on the cantilevers' surfaces. The microcantilevers were then reexamined for their new resonances, and the properties of the deposits were identified using a robust system identification procedure. Results indicate acceptable estimation of the cantilevers' added mass and stiffness, making the technique suitable for detection of elastically distributed biological species.

When used as prediction intervals, coverage is poor when the signal-to-noise ratio is low, but improves slowly as sample size increases. We show that prediction intervals estimated by bagging yield much better coverages than the conventional approach, even with low signal-to-noise ratios. We also present a bootstrap method that gives confidence interval estimates for (conditional) expectations of efficiency, and which have good coverage properties that improve with sample size. In addition, researchers who estimate PSF models typically reject models, samples, or both when residuals have skewness in the "wrong" direction, i.e., in a direction that would seem to indicate absence of inefficiency. We show that correctly specified models can generate samples with "wrongly" skewed residuals, even when the variance of the inefficiency process is nonzero. Both our bagging and bootstrap methods provide useful information about inefficiency and model parameters irrespective of whether residuals have skewness in the desired direction.									23	0	0	2	0	23			0747-4938			WOS:000276099600004

The redox properties of CNO films depend on the functionalization of the carbon surface. In aqueous solutions, the n-CNO/tetra(n-octyl)ammonium bromide (TOABr) films show a behavior typical of an ideal double-layer capacitor with a specific capacitance close to 9.68 F g(-1). The ox-CNOs are electrochemically active at negative potentials due to carboxylic group reduction. Modification of the nano-onion surface with carboxylic groups results in a decrease in the specific capacitance of ox-CNO/TOABr films to 6.57 F g(-1). (C) 2010 The Electrochemical Society.
