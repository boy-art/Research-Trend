J	Kennedy, Ann R.; Crucian, Brian; Huff, Janice L.; Klein, Sabra L.; Morens, David; Murasko, Donna; Nickerson, Cheryl A.; Sonnenfeld, Gerald								Effects of Sex and Gender on Adaptation to Space: Immune System								JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH				23	11			956	958		10.1089/jwh.2014.4913			NOV 1 2014	2014	This review is focused on sex and gender effects on immunological alterations occurring during space flight. Sex differences in immune function and the outcome of inflammatory, infectious, and autoimmune diseases are well documented. The work of the Immunology Workgroup identified numerous reasons why there could be sex and/or gender differences observed during and after spaceflight, but thus far, there has been very little investigation in this area of research. In most cases, this is due to either a low total number of subjects or the minimal number of female flight crew members available for these studies. Thus, the availability of a sufficient number of female subjects to enable statistical analysis of the data has been a limiting factor. As the inclusion of female crew members has increased in the recent past, such studies should be possible in the future. It is very difficult to obtain immunologic and infectious data in small animals that can be usefully extrapolated to humans undergoing spaceflight. Thus, it is recommended by the Immunology Workgroup that a greater emphasis be placed on studying astronauts themselves, with a focus on long-term evaluations of specific, known infectious risks.									5	0	0	1	0	5			1540-9996	1931-843X		WOS:000344868200012	25401940	
J	Huang, Yongxi (Eric); Fan, Yueyue; Chen, Chien-Wei								An Integrated Biofuel Supply Chain to Cope with Feedstock Seasonality and Uncertainty								TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE				48	4	SI		540	554		10.1287/trsc.2013.0498			NOV 2014	2014	A biofuel supply chain consists of various interdependent components from feedstock resources all the way to energy demand sites. This study focuses on the design of an efficient biofuel supply chain system against seasonal variations and uncertainties of feedstock supply in an integrative manner. By integrating planning and operational decisions in a stochastic programming framework, we aim at finding an effective design strategy for biofuel supply chain that is economically viable and hedges well against a wide range of future uncertainties. A solution algorithm based on scenario decomposition is designed to overcome computational challenges involved in large-scale applications. A California case study is implemented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methods in evaluating the economic potential, the infrastructure needs, and the risk of waste-based bioethanol production.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0041-1655			WOS:000344880400006

The Effects of Three Chemical Algaecides on Cell Numbers and Toxin Content of the Cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa and Anabaenopsis sp.								ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT				54	5			1110	1120		10.1007/s00267-014-0339-2			NOV 2014	2014	Toxic cyanobacteria blooms are a growing concern for public health and safety, due in part to the production of the hepatotoxin microcystin by certain species, including Microcystis aeruginosa. Management strategies for controlling cyanobacteria blooms include algaecide treatments, often with copper sulfate, and more recently oxidizers such as sodium percarbonate that produce hydrogen peroxide. This study assessed the effects of two copper-containing algaecides and one sodium percarbonate-containing algaecide on mitigating cell numbers and toxin content of cultured M. aeruginosa and summer (July) bloom samples of Anabaenopsis sp. in a brackish stormwater detention pond. Monitoring of the bloom revealed that Anabaenopsis sp. was associated with elevated levels of orthophosphate compared to nitrogen (dissolved inorganic nitrogen to phosphorus ratios were 0.19-1.80), and the bloom decline (September-October) was likely due to lower autumn water temperatures combined with potential grazing by the dinoflagellate Protoperidinium quinquecorne. Laboratory-based algaecide experiments included three dose levels, and cyanobacteria cell numbers and microcystin concentrations (particulate and dissolved) were evaluated over 7 d. Following exposure, copper-containing treatments generally had lower cell numbers than either sodium percarbonate-containing or control (no algaecide) treatments. Addition of algaecides did not reduce overall microcystin levels, and a release of toxin from the particulate to dissolved phase was observed in most treatments. These findings indicate that algaecide applications may visibly control cyanobacteria bloom densities, but not necessarily toxin concentrations, and have implications for public health and safety.									7	1	0	6	0	8			0364-152X	1432-1009		WOS:000344387800012	25078538

ROLE OF SEDIMENTS IN MODIFYING THE TOXICITY OF TWO ROUNDUP FORMULATIONS TO SIX SPECIES OF LARVAL ANURANS								ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY				33	11			2616	2620		10.1002/etc.2725			NOV 2014	2014	The role of sediment in modifying the toxicity of the original formulation of Roundup (R) and Roundup WeatherMAX (R) was examined in aqueous laboratory tests. Six species of anurans (Bufo fowleri, Hyla chrysoscelis, Rana catesbeiana, Rana clamitans, Rana sphenocephala, and Rana pipiens) were exposed at Gosner stage 25 to concentrations of the 2 herbicide formulations in 96-h, static, nonrenewal experiments in the presence and absence of sediment. All species tested had lower median lethal concentration values in water-only exposures of both formulations compared with exposures with sediment. Sediment significantly altered the potency slopes in all tests with the exceptions of H. chrysoscelis and R. clamitans when exposed to the original formulation of Roundup and H. chrysoscelis and R. sphenocephala when exposed to Roundup WeatherMAX. Thresholds were significantly different in all tests, including those in which potency slopes did not differ. Based on water-sediment exposures of the original formulation of Roundup, all 6 species tested had a margin of safety when compared with the predicted environmental concentration of the highest label application rate. Of the 6 species, 5 had a margin of safety when exposed to Roundup WeatherMAX. During incidental exposures in the field, sediments and organic matter present in aquatic systems provide significant sources of environmental ligands. If used according to label instructions, both herbicides should pose minimal risk to anuran amphibians in actual field applications. Environ Toxicol Chem 2014;33:2616-2620.

We propose the evaluation factors, constraints, and the decision-making criteria necessary to assess the suitability of this PV module for this application. The incorporation of quality function deployment (QFD) and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is the decision-making methodology used in this study. Our approach is innovative and robust in that the evaluation depends upon data collected from PV manufactures datasheets. Unlike traditional research, a hybrid AHP and QFD innovative decision-making methodology has been created, and current commercial PV market data for all pairwise comparisons are used to show that methodology. Using both cooled and uncooled PV modules, best, intermediate, and worst-case scenarios were used to estimate the driving ranges of lightweight EVs powered exclusively by bulk silicon PV modules. Results showed that the available daily driving ranges were between 25 and 60 km and that the CO2 emissions were reduced between 3 and 6.5 kg, compared with internal combustion vehicles of a similar type. We found that mono-Si PV modules were most suited to power low-speed, lightweight, and aerodynamically efficient EVs.									10	0	0	0	0	10			2156-3381			WOS:000344542900040

Fast Distributed Simulation of Sensor Networks Using Optimistic Synchronization								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS				25	11			2888	2898		10.1109/TPDS.2013.263			NOV 2014	2014	Network simulation is an important tool for testing and evaluating wireless sensor network applications. Parallel simulation strategies improve the scalability of these tools. However, achieving high performance depends on reducing the synchronization overhead among simulation processes. In this paper, we present an optimistic simulation algorithm with support for backtracking and re-execution. The algorithm reduces the number of synchronization cycles to the number of transmissions in the network under test. We implement SnapSim, an extension to the popular Avrora simulator, based on this algorithm. The experimental results show that our prototype system improves the performance of Avrora by 2 to 10 times for typical network-centric sensor network applications, and up to three orders of magnitude for applications that use the radio infrequently. We also implement a distributed version of SnapSim, D-SnapSim, which runs on a cluster. The experimental results show that D-SnapSim further improves the performance of SnapSim by up to 10 times for applications that use the radio frequently.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1045-9219	1558-2183		WOS:000343904400012

Abundance-occupancy relationships of larval black flies (Diptera: Simuliidae) in temperate Nearctic streams								INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY				7	6			523	532		10.1111/icad.12075			NOV 2014	2014	1. This study examines abundance-occupancy relationships of larval black flies in temperate streams of the south-eastern United States. It is the first study of abundance-occupancy relationships in lotic macro-invertebrate assemblages to focus on a single family. We address the following questions: (i) Do larval black flies show a strong inter-specific abundance-occupancy relationship? (ii) Do widespread and abundant species demonstrate greater niche breadth (NB) or niche position (NP) than do species with limited distributions and low local abundances? (iii) Does the abundance-occupancy relationship change between habitat generalists and specialists?2. Species abundance was measured as the total mean relative abundance over all sites. Three measures of occupancy were used: occurrence (number of sites occupied), latitudinal extent of occupancy, and longitudinal extent of occupancy. Niche-based indices (breadth and position) were expressed as multivariate indices of habitat variables, reflecting variation in the niche of a species, as opposed to a simple range.3. Non-ecological factors (sampling, analytical artefacts, phylogenetic non-independence) accounted for our results and, accordingly, we focus on ecological explanations of inter-specific abundance-occupancy relationships, grounded in niche and meta-population theory. When occupancy was measured as the number of sites at which a species occurred, a strong inter-specific abundance-occupancy relationship was found. Niche-based indices did not have a significant influence on shaping this relationship. When occupancy was measured as geographic extent, the abundance-occupancy relationship was weak or non-significant, although niche-based indices had a significant effect on occupancy. No evidence supported the notion that meta-population dynamics influence abundance-occupancy relationships. Abundance-occupancy relationship is a summation of individual species traits, a point that often receives little attention.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1752-458X	1752-4598		WOS:000344017100004

Ceramics are generally processed using hot pressing, spark plasma sintering, and conventional solid-state reaction, however such methods can be prohibitively expensive or impractical at production scales. Recently, melt processing has been investigated as an alternative to solid-state sintering methods. Given that melter technology is currently in use for High Level Waste (HLW) vitrification in several countries, the technology readiness of melt processing appears to be advantageous over sintering methods. This work reports the development of candidate multi-phase ceramic compositions processed from a melt. Cr additions, developed to promote the formation and stability of a Cs containing hollandite phase were successfully incorporated into melt processed multi-phase ceramics. Control of the reduction-oxidation (Redox) conditions suppressed undesirable Cs-Mo containing phases, and additions of Al and Fe reduced the melting temperature. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

ZnO-coated SMS structure interrogated by a fiber ring laser for chemical sensing								MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				25	11					114002	10.1088/0957-0233/25/11/114002			NOV 2014	2014	A zinc oxide (ZnO)-coated single mode-multimode-single mode fiber (SMS) structure interrogated by a fiber ring laser has been developed as a chemical sensor. Response to relative humidity (RH) and ethanol volatilization was evaluated by tracking the wavelength shifts of the output laser line in different moisture environments and ethanol solutions, respectively. For humidity sensing a linear response with a measurement range of 4-96% RH, and a sensitivity of 0.06 nm per %RH were obtained. As for ethanol volatilization sensing obvious wavelength blue shift was observed for the sensor immersed in 50% and 62% ethanol solution, while no variation could be detected in pure ethanol solution (purity larger than 97%). With the advantages of low cost, ease of fabrication and sensitive response, ZnO-coated SMS interrogated with a fiber ring laser was demonstrated to be an effective sensor for humidity and ethanol volatilization sensing.					4th Conference on Asia Pacific Optical Sensors (APOS)4th Conference on Asia Pacific Optical Sensors (APOS)	OCT 15-18, 2013OCT 15-18, 2013	Wuhan Univ Technol; Univ Elect Sci & Technol China; Hong Kong Polytechn Univ; Harbin Engn Univ; Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol; Nat Sci Fdn China; Chinese Opt SocWuhan Univ Technol; Univ Elect Sci & Technol China; Hong Kong Polytechn Univ; Harbin Engn Univ; Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol; Nat Sci Fdn China; Chinese Opt Soc	Wuhan, PEOPLES R CHINAWuhan, PEOPLES R CHINA	4	1	0	0	0	5			0957-0233	1361-6501		WOS:000343940800003

Understanding the impact of CeO2 NPs on nutrient cycles, a subchronic toxicity study of CeO2 NPs on soil-denitrification process was performed as a function of particle size (33 and 78 nm), total Ce concentration (50-500 mg L-1), and speciation [Ce(IV) vs. Ce(III)]. The antimicrobial effect on the soil-denitrification process was evaluated in both steady-state and zero-order kinetic models to assess particle- and chemical-species specific toxicity. It was found that soluble Ce(III) was far more toxic than Ce(IV)O-2 NPs when an equal total concentration of Ce was evaluated. Particle size-dependent toxicity, species-dependent toxicity, and concentration-dependent toxicity were all observed in this study for both the steady-state and the kinetic evaluations. Changes in physicochemical properties of Ce(IV)O-2 NPs might be important in assessing the environmental fate and toxicity of NPs in aquatic and terrestrial environments.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0090-4341	1432-0703		WOS:000343751500002	24760446

The Subject-Fixated Coaxially Sighted Corneal Light Reflex: A Clinical Marker for Centration of Refractive Treatments and Devices								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY				158	5			863	874		10.1016/j.ajo.2014.06.028			NOV 2014	2014	PURPOSE: To describe the inconsistencies in definition, application, and usage of the ocular reference axes (optical axis, visual axis, line of sight, pupillary axis, and topographic axis) and angles (angle kappa, lambda, and alpha) and to propose a precise, reproducible, clinically defined reference marker and axis for centration of refractive treatments and devices.DESIGN: Perspective.METHODS: Literature review of papers dealing with ocular reference axes, angles, and centration.RESULTS: The inconsistent definitions and usage of the current ocular axes, as derived from eye models, limit their clinical utility. With a clear understanding of Purkinje images and a defined alignment of the observer, light source/fixation target, and subject eye, the subject-fixated coaxially sighted corneal light reflex can be a clinically useful reference marker. The axis formed by connecting the subject-fixated coaxially sighted corneal light reflex and the fixation point, the subject-fixated coaxially sighted corneal light reflex axis, is independent of pupillary dilation and phakic status of the eye. The relationship of the subject-fixated coaxially sighted corneal light reflex axis to a refined definition of the visual axis without reference to nodal points, the foveal-fixation axis, is discussed. The displacement between the subject-fixated coaxially sighted corneal light reflex and pupil center is described not by an angle, but by a chord, here termed chord mu. The application of the subject-fixated coaxially sighted corneal light reflex to the surgical centration of refractive treatments and devices is discussed.CONCLUSION: As a clinically defined reference marker, the subject-fixated coaxially sighted corneal light reflex avoids the shortcomings of current ocular axes for clinical application and may contribute to better consensus in the literature and improved patient outcomes.

J	Penney, R.; Hoeflich, P.								THERMONUCLEAR SUPERNOVAE: PROBING MAGNETIC FIELDS BY POSITRONS AND LATE-TIME IR LINE PROFILES								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				795	1					84	10.1088/0004-637X/795/1/84			NOV 1 2014	2014	We show the importance of gamma and positron transport for the formation of late-time spectra in Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The goal is to study the imprint of magnetic fields (B) on late-time IR line profiles, particularly the [Fe II] feature at 1.644 mu m, which becomes prominent two to three months after the explosion. As a benchmark, we use the explosion of a Chandrasekhar mass (M-Ch) white dwarf (WD) and, specifically, a delayed detonation model that can reproduce the light curves and spectra for a Branch-normal SN Ia. We assume WDs with initial magnetic surface fields between 1 and 10(9) G. We discuss large-scale dipole and small-scale magnetic fields. We show that positron transport effects must be taken into account for the interpretation of emission features starting at about one to two years after maximum light, depending on the size of B. The [Fe II] line profile and its evolution with time can be understood in terms of the overall energy input by radioactive decay and the transition from a gamma-ray to a positron-dominated regime. We find that the [Fe II] line at 1.644 mu m can be used to analyze the overall chemical and density structure of the exploding WD up to day 200 without considering B. At later times, positron transport and magnetic field effects become important. After about day 300, the line profile allows one to probe the size of the B-field. The profile becomes sensitive to the morphology of B at about day 500. In the presence of a large-scale dipole field, a broad line is produced in M-Ch mass explosions that may appear flat-topped or rounded depending on the inclination at which the SN is observed. Small or no directional dependence of the spectra is found for small-scale B. We note that narrow-line profiles require central Ni-56 as shown in our previous studies. Persistent broad-line, flat-topped profiles require high-density burning, which is the signature of a WD close to M-Ch. Good time coverage is required to separate the effects of optical depth, the size and morphology of B, and the aspect angle of the observer. The spectra require a resolution of about 500 km s(-1) and a signal-to-noise ratio of about 20%. Two other strong near-IR spectral features at about 1.5 and 1.8 mu m are used to demonstrate the importance of line blending, which may invalidate a kinematic interpretation of emission lines. Flat-topped line profiles between 300 and 400 days have been observed and reported in the literature. They lend support for M-Ch mass explosions in at least some cases and require magnetic fields equal to or in excess of 10(6) G. We briefly discuss the effects of the size and morphology of B on light curves, as well as limitations. We argue that line profiles are a more direct measurement of B than light curves because they measure both the distribution of Ni-56 and the redistribution of the energy input by positrons rather than the total energy input. Finally, we discuss possible mechanisms for the formation of high B-fields and the limitations of our analysis.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000343857300084		
J	Shen, Haiying; Li, Ze								Leveraging Social Networks for Effective Spam Filtering								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS				63	11			2743	2759		10.1109/TC.2013.152			NOV 2014	2014	The explosive growth of unsolicited e-mails has prompted the development of numerous spam filter techniques. Bayesian spam filters are superior to static keyword-based spam filters in that they can continuously evolve to tackle new spam by learning keywords in new spam emails. However, Bayesian spam filters are easily poisoned by clever spammers who avoid spam keywords and add many innocuous words in their emails. Also, Bayesian spam filters need a significant amount of time to adapt to a new spam based on user feedback. Moreover, few current spam filters exploit social networks to assist in spam detection. In order to develop an accurate and user-friendly spam filter, we propose a SOcial network Aided Personalized and effective spam filter (SOAP) in this paper. In SOAP, each node connects to its social friends; i.e., nodes form a distributed overlay by directly using social network links as overlay links. Each node uses SOAP to collect information and check spam autonomously in a distributed manner. Unlike previous spam filters that focus on parsing keywords (e. g., Bayesian filters) or building blacklists, SOAP exploits the social relationships among email correspondents and their (dis) interests to detectspamadaptively and automatically. In each node, SOAP integrates four components into the basic Bayesian filter: social closeness-based spam filtering, social interest-based spam filtering, adaptive trust management, and friend notification. We have evaluated the performance of SOAP using simulation based on trace data from Facebook. We also have implemented a SOAP prototype for real-world experiments. Experimental results show that SOAPcan greatly improve the performance of Bayesian spam filters in terms of accuracy, attack-resilience, and efficiency of spam detection. The performance of the Bayesian spam filter is SOAP's lower bound.									4	1	0	0	0	4			0018-9340	1557-9956		WOS:000343887700009		
J	Irmak, Suat; Payero, Jose O.; Kilic, Ayse; Odhiambo, Lameck O.; Rudnick, Daran; Sharma, Vivek; Billesbach, David								On the magnitude and dynamics of eddy covariance system residual energy (energy balance closure error) in subsurface drip-irrigated maize field during growing and non-growing (dormant) seasons								IRRIGATION SCIENCE				32	6			471	483		10.1007/s00271-014-0443-3			NOV 2014	2014	We investigated the magnitude and dynamics of the eddy covariance system (ECS) residual energy (energy balance closure error) for a subsurface drip-irrigated maize (Zea mays L.) field in 2005 and 2006 growing and non-growing (dormant) seasons. The corrections for coordinate rotation, oxygen, frequency, and Webb-Pearman-Leuning corrections improved the slope of the total convective energy (latent heat + sensible heat) with respect to the net available energy (from 0.68 to 0.84), but the data filtering (for horizontal and frictional wind speeds higher than 2 m s(-1) and lower than 0.2 m s(-1)) had little effect on the slope. Also, the number of data points available for the analyses was reduced by 53 % after filtering. Overall, the daytime residual energy varied between -100 and 200 W m(-2) during the dormant seasons and between -500 and 600 W m(-2) during the growing seasons. Most of the nighttime residual energy ranged within +/- 40 W m(-2) during the calendar year in 2005 and within -60 and 20 W m(-2) in 2006. During nighttime, the total convective energy is vertically distributed with respect to (R (n) - G), indicating that the total convective energy is independent of the variations in (R (n) - G). Secondly, it was observed that nighttime residual energy did not show any seasonal variation patterns throughout the two consecutive years and confined mostly within a narrow range of +/- 40 W m(-2), showing no dependency on seasonal changes in surface conditions. The maximum variation in residual energy was usually around frictional wind speed of 0.3-0.5 m s(-1) (varying between -150 and 300 W m(-2)) and then decreasing to a range of +/- 100 W m(-2) at higher frictional wind speeds. On average, the residual energy decreased by about 33 W m(-2) (after the intercept) for every 1.0 m s(-1) increase in frictional wind speed, whereas the residual energy decreased by about 4 W m(-2) (after the intercept) for every 1.0 m s(-1) increase in horizontal wind speed. Similar diurnal residual energy distribution patterns, with different magnitudes, were observed during growing and dormant seasons. Even though a slight decrease in residual energy was observed with increase in leaf area index (LAI) in both growing seasons, LAI did not have considerable influence on the seasonal variation in the residual energy. The residual energy was also evaluated by separating the data into morning and afternoon hours. We observed that the root-mean-squared difference value is slightly greater for the morning data than the afternoon, indicating greater residual energy in the morning hours due to weaker turbulent mixing than the afternoon. Overall, significant reduction in the available evapotranspiration data after applying a series of corrections possess challenges in terms of utilization of ECS for in-season irrigation management and crop water requirement determinations that needs to be further researched and addressed.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0342-7188	1432-1319		WOS:000343818200006

Internal branding efforts have been suggested as a way to improve employee performance. With this in mind, we develop a two-process model based on identification and internalization theories to explain how internally disseminating brand-relevant information to frontline employees enhances performance. Using multi-source data from the employees, managers, and customers of a business-to-business firm in the hospitality industry, we find that providing brand-specific information directly to frontline employees increases their identification with the brand (as evidenced in perceptions of firm authenticity) and enhances their internalization of brand values. Additional results suggest that firms should make an extra effort to communicate brand-specific information to frontline employees if they desire brand-consistent performance that is observable to managers and customers alike.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0092-0703	1552-7824		WOS:000344072700004		
J	Zhong, Ma; Zhao Xinbo; Zou Xiao-chun; Wang, James Z.; Wang Wenhu								Markov chain based computational visual attention model that learns from eye tracking data								PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS				49				1	10		10.1016/j.patrec.2014.06.002			NOV 1 2014	2014	Computational visual attention models are a topic of increasing importance in computer understanding of images. Most existing attention models are based on bottom-up computation that often does not match actual human attention. To address this problem, we propose a novel visual attention model that is learned from actual eye tracking data. We use a Markov chain to model the relationship between the image feature and the saliency, then train a support vector regression (SVR) from true eye tracking data to predict the transition probabilities of the Markov chain. Finally, a saliency map predicting user's attention is obtained from the stationary distribution of this chain.

The mechanically alloyed compositions were sintered through a spark-plasma sintering (SPS) process. The effect of the milling time was investigated. In order to characterize the powders obtained via mechanical alloying, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis were used. The morphological evolution was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results showed that the p-type Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3 compound was formed after 2 h of milling. Further, the variation of milling time showed that the synthesized phase was stable. All the powders exhibit the same morphology albeit with slight differences. Measurements of the electrical resistivity, Seebeck coefficient and thermal conductivity were performed in the temperature range 300-520 K for the SPS samples. The resulting thermoelectric figure of merit ZT reaches a maximum of 1.2 at 360 K for the p-type bulk material with a 5 h milling time. This study demonstrates the possibility of preparing thermoelectric materials of high performance and short processing time. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the mechanisms underlying PE are poorly understood and major questions regarding etiology and risk factors remain to be addressed. Our objective was to examine whether abnormal expression of the cardiovascular developmental transcription factor, Nkx2-5, was associated with early onset and severe preeclampsia (EOSPE). Methods: Using qPCR and immunohistochemical assay, we examined expression of Nkx2-5 and target gene expression in EOSPE and control placental tissue. We tested resulting mechanistic hypotheses in cultured cells using shRNA knockdown, qPCR, and western blot. Results: Nkx2-5 is highly expressed in racially disparate fashion (Caucasians>African Americans) in a subset of early EOSPE placentae. Nkx2-5 mRNA expression is highly correlated (Caucasians>African Americans) to mRNA expression of the preeclampsia marker sFlt-1, and of the Nkx2-5 target and RNA splicing factor, Sam68. Knockdown of Sam68 expression in cultured cells significantly impacts sFlt-1 mRNA isoform generation in vitro, supporting a mechanistic hypothesis that Nkx2-5 impacts EOSPE severity in a subset of patients via upregulation of Sam68 to increase sFlt-1 expression. Expression of additional Nkx2-5 targets potentially regulating metabolic stress response is also elevated in a racially disparate fashion in EOSPE. Conclusions: Expression of Nkx2-5 and its target genes may directly influence the genesis and racially disparate severity, and define a mechanistically distinct subclass of EOSPE.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1064-1955	1525-6065		WOS:000343674700005	24987805

Such environments increase the risk of diarrheal disease, including diseases caused by enteric pathogens. To describe adherence to sanitation standards in classrooms and food preparation areas in child-care facilities, the authors conducted site visits in 40 North Carolina and South Carolina child-care facilities. Audits in up to two classrooms (rooms providing care for infants and toddlers) and the kitchen were performed using a form similar to a regulatory inspection form. Audit data were used to calculate indices to describe adherence to sanitation standards and were based on state environmental health regulations for child-care centers, the Food and Drug Administration's Food Code 2009, and guidance from food safety experts. Most facilities participating in the authors' study adhered to sanitation standards within the classroom; however, deficiencies with regard to sanitation in food preparation areas and refrigerator operating temperatures were noted. These results provide insight into possible risk factors for enteric disease transmission in child-care facilities.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-0892			WOS:000343675000004	25603619

Discovery in Female Atlantic Croaker and Evidence ZIP9 Mediates Testosterone-Induced Apoptosis of Ovarian Follicle Cells								ENDOCRINOLOGY				155	11			4237	4249		10.1210/en.2014-1198			NOV 2014	2014	Rapid, cell surface-initiated, pregenomic androgen actions have been described in various vertebrate cells, but the receptors mediating these actions remain unidentified. We report here the cloning and expression of a cDNA from Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus) ovaries encoding a 33-kDa, seven-transmembrane protein with binding and signaling characteristics of a membrane androgen receptor that is unrelated to any previously described steroid receptor. Instead, croaker membrane androgen receptor has 81-93% amino acid sequence identity with zinc transporter ZIP9 (SLC39A9) subfamily members, indicating it is a ZIP9 protein. Croaker ZIP9 is expressed in gonadal tissues and in brain and is up-regulated in the ovary by reproductive hormones. Croaker ZIP9 protein is localized to plasma membranes of croaker granulosa cells and human breast cancer (SKBR-3) cells stably transfected with ZIP9. Recombinant croaker ZIP9 has a high affinity (dissociation constant, K-d, 12.7 nM), limited capacity (maximal binding capacity 2.8 nM/mg protein), displaceable, single binding site-specific for androgens, characteristic of steroid receptors. Testosterone activates a stimulatory G protein coupled to ZIP9, resulting in increased cAMP production. Testosterone promotes serum starvation-induced cell death and apoptosis in transfected cells and in croaker ovarian follicle cells that is associated with rapid increases in intracellular free zinc concentrations, suggesting an involvement of zinc in this nonclassical androgen action to promote apoptosis. These responses to testosterone are abrogated by treatment with ZIP9 small interfering RNA. The results provide the first evidence that zinc transporter proteins can function as specific steroid membrane receptors and indicate a previously unrecognized signaling pathway mediated by steroid receptors involving alterations in intracellular zinc.									13	0	0	10	0	13			0013-7227	1945-7170		WOS:000343422800015	25014354

Spatial and temporal analysis of land cover changes and water quality in the Lake Issaqueena watershed, South Carolina								ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT				186	11			7617	7630		10.1007/s10661-014-3953-9			NOV 2014	2014	Monitoring changes in land cover and the subsequent environmental responses are essential for water quality assessment, natural resource planning, management, and policies. Over the last 75 years, the Lake Issaqueena watershed has experienced a drastic shift in land use. This study was conducted to examine the changes in land cover and the implied changes in land use that have occurred and their environmental, water quality impacts. Aerial photography of the watershed (1951, 1956, 1968, 1977, 1989, 1999, 2005, 2006, and 2009) was analyzed and classified using the geographic information system (GIS) software. Seven land cover classes were defined: evergreen, deciduous, bare ground, pasture/grassland, cultivated, and residential/other development. Water quality data, including sampling depth, water temperature, dissolved oxygen content, fecal coliform levels, inorganic nitrogen concentrations, and turbidity, were obtained from the South Carolina (SC) Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC) for two stations and analyzed for trends as they relate to land cover change. From 1951 to 2009, the watershed experienced an increase of tree cover and bare ground (+17.4 % evergreen, +62.3 % deciduous, +9.8 % bare ground) and a decrease of pasture/grassland and cultivated land (-42.6 % pasture/grassland and -57.1 % cultivated). From 2005 to 2009, there was an increase of 21.5 % in residential/other development. Sampling depth ranged from 0.1 to 0.3 m. Water temperature fluctuated corresponding to changing air temperatures, and dissolved oxygen content fluctuated as a factor of water temperature. Inorganic nitrogen content was higher from December to April possibly due to application of fertilizers prior to the growing season. Turbidity and fecal coliform bacteria levels remained relatively the same from 1962 to 2005, but a slight decline in pH can be observed at both stations. Prior to 1938, the area consisted of single-crop cotton farms; after 1938, the farms were abandoned, leaving large bare areas with highly eroded soil. Starting in 1938, Clemson reforested almost 30 % of the watershed. Currently, three fourths of the watershed is forestland, with a limited coverage of small farms and residential developments. Monitoring water quality is essential in maintaining adequate freshwater supply. Water quality monitoring focuses mainly on the collection of field data, but current water quality conditions depend on the cumulative impacts of land cover change over time.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0167-6369	1573-2959		WOS:000343051400048	25124990

Sensitivity of Monilinia fructicola from Peach Farms in China to Four Fungicides and Characterization of Isolates Resistant to Carbendazim and Azoxystrobin								PLANT DISEASE				98	11			1555	1560		10.1094/PDIS-11-13-1145-RE			NOV 2014	2014	Brown rot of peach caused by Monilinia fructicola can cause considerable preharvest and postharvest losses in China. Fungicides are increasingly utilized to minimize such losses. Eighty isolates of M. fructicola were collected from commercial peach orchards located in five provinces in China and the sensitivity to carbendazim, azoxystrobin, tebuconazole, and boscalid was determined. Resistance to carbendazim was detected only in the Yunnan province in 15 of 16 isolates. Characterization of carbendazim-resistant isolates revealed stable resistance, no fitness penalty, and negative cross resistance to diethofencarb. Resistant isolates produced disease symptoms on detached fruit sprayed with label rates of formulated carbendazim and possessed the amino acid mutation E198A in beta-tubulin. Resistance to azoxystrobin was detected in 3 of 10 isolates from Fujian. In contrast to carbendazim resistance, however, azoxystrobin resistance was unstable, associated with a fitness penalty, and not associated with mutations in the target gene cytochrome b. The concentration at which mycelial growth is inhibited 50% (EC50) values of the azoxystrobin-sensitive isolates were 0.02 to 1.94 mu g/ml, with a mean value of 0.54 mu g/ml. All isolates were sensitive to tebuconazole, with a mean EC50 value of 0.03 mu g/ml. The EC50 values for boscalid were 0.01 to 3.85 mu g/ml, with a mean value of 1.02 mu g/ml. Our results indicate that methyl benzimidazole carbamates (MBCs), quionon outside inhibitors, demethylation inhibitor fungicides, and succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors are likely to be very effective in controlling brown rot in many peach production areas in China, but that resistance to MBCs is emerging.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0191-2917	1943-7692		WOS:000343359300013

J	Pei, Bin; Pang, Weichiang; Testik, Firat Y.; Ravichandran, Nadarajah; Liu, Fangqian								Mapping joint hurricane wind and surge hazards for Charleston, South Carolina								NATURAL HAZARDS				74	2			375	403		10.1007/s11069-014-1185-5			NOV 2014	2014	Combined effects of hurricane wind and surge can pose significant threats to coastal cities. Although current design codes consider the joint occurrence of wind and surge, information on site-specific joint distributions of hurricane wind and surge along the US Coast is still sparse and limited. In this study, joint hazard maps for combined hurricane wind and surge for Charleston, South Carolina (SC), were developed. A stochastic Markov chain hurricane simulation program was utilized to generate 50,000 years of full-track hurricane events. The surface wind speeds and surge heights from individual hurricanes were computed using the Georgiou's wind field model and the Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model, respectively. To validate the accuracy of the SLOSH model, the simulated surge levels were compared to the surge levels calculated by another state-of-the-art storm surge model, ADCIRC (Advanced Circulation), and the actual observed water elevations from historical hurricane events. Good agreements were found between the simulated and observed water elevations. The model surface wind speeds were also compared with the design wind speeds in ASCE 7-10 and were found to agree well with the design values. Using the peak wind speeds and maximum surge heights, the joint hazard surfaces and the joint hazard maps for Charleston, SC, were developed. As part of this study, an interactive computer program, which can be used to obtain the joint wind speed and surge height distributions for any location in terms of latitude and longitude in Charleston area, was created. These joint hazard surfaces and hazard maps can be used in a multi-hazard design or risk assessment framework to consider the combined effects of hurricane wind and surge.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0921-030X	1573-0840		WOS:000342910400004		
J	Petukh, Marharyta; Alexov, Emil								Ion binding to biological macromolecules.								Asian journal of physics : an international quarterly research journal				23	5			735	744					2014-Nov	2014	Biological macromolecules carry out their functions in water and in the presence of ions. The ions can bind to the macromolecules either specifically or non-specifically, or can simply to be a part of the water phase providing physiological gradient across various membranes. This review outlines the differences between specific and non-specific ion binding in terms of the function and stability of the corresponding macromolecules. Furthermore, the experimental techniques to identify ion positions and computational methods to predict ion binding are reviewed and their advantages compared. It is indicated that specifically bound ions are relatively easier to be revealed while non-specifically associated ions are difficult to predict. In addition, the binding and the residential time of non-specifically bound ions are very much sensitive to the environmental factors in the cells, specifically to the local pH and ion concentration. Since these characteristics differ among the cellular compartments, the non-specific ion binding must be investigated with respect to the sub-cellular localization of the corresponding macromolecule.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0971-3093			MEDLINE:25774076	25774076

As obesity and dementia rates reach epidemic proportions, an even greater interest in the effects of nutrition on the brain have become evident. This review discusses various mechanisms by which a high fat diet and/or obesity can alter the brain and cognition. It is well known that a poor diet and obesity can lead to certain disorders such as type II diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and heart disease. However, long-term effects of obesity on the brain need to be further examined. The contribution of insulin resistance and oxidative stress is briefly reviewed from studies in the current literature. The role of inflammation and vascular alterations are described in more detail due to our laboratory's experience in evaluating these specific factors. It is very likely that each of these factors plays a role in diet-induced and/or obesity-induced cognitive decline.									29	0	0	25	0	29			1028-415X	1476-8305		WOS:000342507200001	24192577

Paul Bruckman and Peter Anderson conjectured a formula for zeta(m), the density of primes p for which m vertical bar Z(p) on the basis of numerical evidence.

Isolation of an aerobic vinyl chloride oxidizer from anaerobic groundwater								BIODEGRADATION				25	6			893	901		10.1007/s10532-014-9708-z			NOV 2014	2014	Vinyl chloride (VC) is a known human carcinogen and common groundwater contaminant. Reductive dechlorination of VC to non-toxic ethene under anaerobic conditions has been demonstrated at numerous hazardous waste sites. However, VC disappearance without stoichiometric production of ethene has also been observed at some sites and in microcosms. In this study we identify an organism responsible for this observation in presumably anaerobic microcosms and conclude that oxygen was not detectable based on a lack of color change from added resazurin. This organism, a Mycobacterium sp. closely related to known VC oxidizing strains, was present in high numbers in 16S rRNA gene clone libraries from a groundwater microcosm. Although the oxidation/reduction indicator resazurin remained in the clear reduced state in these studies, these results suggest inadvertent oxygen contamination occurred. This study helps to elucidate the dynamic behavior of chlorinated ethenes in contaminated groundwater, through the isolation of a strictly aerobic organism that may be responsible for at least some disappearance of VC without the concomitant production of ethene in groundwater considered anaerobic.									4	0	0	4	0	4			0923-9820	1572-9729		WOS:000342174000010	25151178

Families of post-cardiac arrest patients are left with difficult decisions to be made.OBJECTIVE: This article is a comprehensive literature review examining the current research available to health care professionals about the biomarker serum neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and its use in predicting neurological outcomes in comatose post-cardiac arrest patients.METHODS: Using the bibliographic databases CINAHL, Plus, EBSCOhost, MEDLINE, PubMed, Google Scholar, H. W. Wilson, Cochrane, and NEXUS, from the period 2003 to 2013, revealed there is minimal research or literature on NSE predicting neurological outcomes post-cardiac arrest.RESULTS: Research on this particular biomarker is relatively new, and more research is necessary to establish an adequate amount of support. At this time, an exact NSE cutoff value or its exact ability to help predict neurological outcomes is unable to be established, and further research is necessary.DISCUSSION: This literature review should provide a basic understanding of NSE and its ability to help predict neurological outcomes of post-cardiac arrest patients earlier. The research provides evidence that NSE should be considered in determining outcomes. However, more research is necessary before nursing practice is changed and implemented into patient care.									1	1	0	1	0	2				1538-8646		MEDLINE:25280197	25280197

Systematic engineering tools for describing and improving medication administration processes at rural healthcare facilities								APPLIED ERGONOMICS				45	6			1712	1724		10.1016/j.apergo.2014.06.003			NOV 2014	2014	This study demonstrates a series of systematic methods for mapping medication administration processes and for elaborating violations of work standards at two rural hospitals. Thirty-four observational periods were conducted to capture the details of clinical activities, and hierarchical task analysis (HTA) was used to demonstrate the current medication administration process. Facility nurse managers in five units across the two facilities participated in focus group discussions to validate the observational data and to generate a reliable context-appropriate medication administration process. The potential errors or misconduct when passing the drugs were identified, such as unsafe storage and transportation of drugs from room to room. Those hazards would cause drug contamination, loss, or access by unauthorized individuals. Hospitals without 24-hour pharmacy coverage and other interruptions would hinder the medication administration process. Preparing drugs for more than one patient at a time would increase the risk of passing the drugs to the wrong patient. This study shows the use of observation and focus groups to describe and identify violations in the medication administration process. A clear road map for continuous clinical process improvement obtained from the current study could be used to help future health information technology implementation.

Exponents of polar codes using algebraic geometric code kernels								DESIGNS CODES AND CRYPTOGRAPHY				73	2	SI		699	717		10.1007/s10623-014-9987-8			NOV 2014	2014	Reed-Solomon and BCH codes were considered as kernels of polar codes by Mori and Tanaka (IEEE Information Theory Workshop, 2010, pp 1-5) and Korada et al. (IEEE Trans Inform Theory 56(12):6253-6264, 2010) to create polar codes with large exponents. Mori and Tanaka showed that Reed-Solomon codes over the finite field with elements give the best possible exponent among all codes of length . They also stated that a Hermitian code over with , a simple algebraic geometric code, gives a larger exponent than the Reed-Solomon matrix over the same field. In this paper, we expand on these ideas by employing more general algebraic geometric (AG) codes to produce kernels of polar codes. Lower bounds on the exponents are given for kernels from general AG codes, Hermitian codes, and Suzuki codes. We demonstrate that both Hermitian and Suzuki kernels have larger exponents than Reed-Solomon codes over the same field, for ; however, the larger exponents are at the expense of larger kernel matrices. Comparing kernels of the same size, though over different fields, we see that Reed-Solomon kernels have larger exponents than both Hermitian and Suzuki kernels. These results indicate a tradeoff between the exponent, kernel matrix size, and field size.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0925-1022	1573-7586		WOS:000339826100027

The malfunctioning of SMS in SRS patients is associated with several identified missense mutations that occur away from the active site. This investigation deals with a particular SRS-causing mutation, the G56S mutation, which was shown computationally and experimentally to destabilize the SMS homo-dimer and thus to abolish SMS enzymatic activity. As a proof-of-concept, we explore the possibility to restore the enzymatic activity of the malfunctioning SMS mutant G56S by stabilizing the dimer through small molecule binding at the mutant homo-dimer interface. For this purpose, we designed an in silico protocol that couples virtual screening and a free binding energy-based approach to identify potential small-molecule binders on the destabilized G56S dimer, with the goal to stabilize it and thus to increase SMS G56S mutant activity. The protocol resulted in extensive list of plausible stabilizers, among which we selected and tested 51 compounds experimentally for their capability to increase SMS G56S mutant enzymatic activity. In silico analysis of the experimentally identified stabilizers suggested five distinctive chemical scaffolds. This investigation suggests that druggable pockets exist in the vicinity of the mutation sites at protein-protein interfaces which can be used to alter the disease-causing effects by small molecule binding. The identified chemical scaffolds are druglike and can serve as original starting points for development of lead molecules to further rescue the disease-causing effects of the Snyder-Robinson syndrome for which no efficient treatment exists up to now.									8	0	0	4	0	8			1932-6203			WOS:000343662800067	25340632

The antioxidant activity of GSH was evaluated using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazy (DPPH) radical inhibition. A Box-Behnken design (BBD) with three independent variables, which were concentration, electric field intensity and pulse frequency was used to establish the regression equation of second-order response surface. Optimal conditions were as follows: GSH concentration 8.86 mg/mL, electric field intensity 9.74 kV/cm and pulse frequency 2549.08 Hz. The DPPH radical inhibition increased from 81.83% to 97.40%. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) and mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR) were used to analyse the change of structure and functional groups of GSH. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Li, Lin; Zhang, Qizhi; Ding, Yihua; Jiang, Huabei; Thiers, Bruce H.; Wang, James Z.								Automatic diagnosis of melanoma using machine learning methods on a spectroscopic system								BMC MEDICAL IMAGING				14						36	10.1186/1471-2342-14-36			OCT 13 2014	2014	Background: Early and accurate diagnosis of melanoma, the deadliest type of skin cancer, has the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality rate. However, early diagnosis of melanoma is not trivial even for experienced dermatologists, as it needs sampling and laboratory tests which can be extremely complex and subjective. The accuracy of clinical diagnosis of melanoma is also an issue especially in distinguishing between melanoma and mole. To solve these problems, this paper presents an approach that makes non-subjective judgements based on quantitative measures for automatic diagnosis of melanoma.Methods: Our approach involves image acquisition, image processing, feature extraction, and classification. 187 images (19 malignant melanoma and 168 benign lesions) were collected in a clinic by a spectroscopic device that combines single-scattered, polarized light spectroscopy with multiple-scattered, un-polarized light spectroscopy. After noise reduction and image normalization, features were extracted based on statistical measurements (i.e. mean, standard deviation, mean absolute deviation, L-1 norm, and L-2 norm) of image pixel intensities to characterize the pattern of melanoma. Finally, these features were fed into certain classifiers to train learning models for classification.Results: We adopted three classifiers - artificial neural network, naive bayes, and k-nearest neighbour to evaluate our approach separately. The naive bayes classifier achieved the best performance - 89% accuracy, 89% sensitivity and 89% specificity, which was integrated with our approach in a desktop application running on the spectroscopic system for diagnosis of melanoma.Conclusions: Our work has two strengths. (1) We have used single scattered polarized light spectroscopy and multiple scattered unpolarized light spectroscopy to decipher the multilayered characteristics of human skin. (2) Our approach does not need image segmentation, as we directly probe tiny spots in the lesion skin and the image scans do not involve background skin. The desktop application for automatic diagnosis of melanoma can help dermatologists get a non-subjective second opinion for their diagnosis decision.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1471-2342			WOS:000344503300001	25311811

Glycosylation-related genes in NS0 cells are insensitive to moderately elevated ammonium concentrations								JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY				187				78	86		10.1016/j.jbiotec.2014.07.018			OCT 10 2014	2014	NS0 and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines are used to produce recombinant proteins for human therapeutics; however, ammonium accumulation can negatively impact cell growth, recombinant protein production, and protein glycosylation. To improve product quality and decrease costs, the relationship between ammonium and protein glycosylation needs to be elucidated. While ammonium has been shown to adversely affect glycosylation-related gene expression in CHO cells, NS0 studies have not been performed. Therefore, this study sought to determine if glycosylation in NS0 cells were ammonium-sensitive at the gene expression level. Using a DNA microarray that contained mouse glycosylation-related and housekeeping genes, these genes were analyzed in response to various culture conditions - elevated ammonium, elevated salt, and elevated ammonium with proline. Surprisingly, no significant differences in gene expression levels were observed between the control and these conditions. Further, the elevated ammonium cultures were analyzed using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) for key glycosylation genes, and the qRT-PCR results corroborated the DNA microarray results, demonstrating that NS0 cells are ammonium-insensitive at the gene expression level. Since NS0 are known to have elevated nucleotide sugar pools under ammonium stress, and none of the genes directly responsible for these metabolic pools were changed, consequently cellular control at the translational or substrate-level must be responsible for the universally observed decreased glycosylation quality under elevated ammonium.

This can provide quantitative information regarding drug biodistribution, and drug dose that is delivered to cells or tissues. Here, X-ray excited optical luminescent (XEOL) NPs coated with poly(glycolide)-poly(ethylene glycol) (XGP) are used measure the amount of drug released into cells. The photoactive drug protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) is loaded into XGP and is able to attenuate the XEOL NP emission. Measuring an increase in XEOL intensity as PpIX is released enables the measurement of drug release into glioblastoma cells (GBM). Biodistribution studies in a BALB/c mouse GBM intracranial xenograft model show significant XGP accumulation at the site of the GBM xenograft within the brain, and not in adjacent healthy brain tissues. There is no uptake of XGP in the heart or kidneys, the primary organs associated with drug and gadolinium ion toxicity. NP toxicity is tested with U-138MG GBM in vitro, and NPs show low cytotoxicity at concentrations of 100 g/mL. In vivo dose escalation studies in BALB/c mice show no adverse effects at doses up to 75 mg/kg. These theranostic NPs offer an approach to quantitatively measure drug release into cells.									4	0	0	2	0	4			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000342794500005

Wetting of nanofiber yarns								COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS				459				22	30		10.1016/j.colsurfa.2014.06.037			OCT 5 2014	2014	In order to probe and interpret the wetting properties of nanofiber yarns, a modification of the original Cassie-Baxter model of apparent contact angle was developed. The model includes the effect of fiber tilt: on the surface of tilted fiber the contact line describes an elliptical arc rather than a circular. With this new interpretation of the capillary rise experiments we studied the wetting properties of nanofiber yarns made of cellulose acetate (CA), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), and their blends. Wetting properties of nanofiber yarns were compared with those of the films. The Zisman plot was created to show that the critical interfacial tensions of CA and PMMA films are very close to each other. However, the contact angles of water droplets placed on the films casted from the CA/PMMA blends appeared significantly smaller than those obtained on the pure CA and PMMA films. Inspection of the film morphology revealed a bumpy structure of the CA/PMMA films leading to their enhanced hydrophilicity. In contrast, the nanofibers that were electrospun form the CA/PMMA blends had smooth surface. We were able to confirm that the contact angles of water with the CA/PMMA nanofibers are similar to those of water with the pure CA and PMMA films. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

While photoluminescence properties of carbon dots had targeted optical imaging and related usage, their unique excited state redox processes responsible for the luminescence emissions may find potentially significant optoelectronic applications. In this regard, we investigated the electroluminescence properties of the carbon dots integrated into multilayer light emitting diode devices. The devices emitted white light with a slight blue color, visible to naked eyes, thus validating the expectation that carbon dots may potentially serve as a new platform for electroluminescent nanomaterials.

We simulate the time evolution of the coarse-grained H-function (H) over bar (t) for a two-dimensional harmonic oscillator. For a (periodic) wave function that is a superposition of the first 25 energy states we confirm an approximately exponential decay of (H) over bar over five periods. For a superposition of only the first four energy states we are able to calculate (H) over bar (t) over 50 periods. We find that, depending on the set of phases in the initial wave function, (H) over bar can decay to a large nonequilibrium residue exceeding 10% of its initial value or it can become indistinguishable from zero (the equilibrium value). We show that a large residue in (H) over bar is caused by a tendency for the trajectories to be confined to sub-regions of configuration space for some wave functions, and that this is less likely to occur for larger numbers of energy states (if the initial phases are chosen randomly). Possible cosmological implications are briefly discussed.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1751-8113	1751-8121		WOS:000342385400010		
J	Kadegowda, Anil K G; Wright, Asher; Duckett, Susan K								Nutritional milieu of isolated stromal vascular cells determines their proliferative, adipogenic, and lipogenic capacity in vitro.								Adipocyte				3	4			304	13		10.4161/adip.32112			2014 Oct-Dec	2014	The objective was to determine the effect of nutritional milieu of isolated stromal vascular (SV) cells on proliferative capacity of preadipocytes, and adipogenic and lipogenic capacity in adipocytes in vitro. Proliferation of the preadipocytes increased over time with 48 and 72h being greater than 24h; however, preadipocytes from steers supplemented with corn (LC) had lower proliferation rates compared with those without corn grain supplementation (L) at 72h. Adipocyte cultures isolated from LC group had higher mean diameter on d 4 and 6, and higher mean volume on d 0, 4, 6, and 12 of culture. Adipocytes from steers supplemented with corn grain (LC) had lower expression of key adipogenic genes during extended days in culture. The results show that prior nutritional treatment of the donor animal used to isolate SV cultures alters their proliferative, adipogenic, and lipogenic capacity in culture. These differences may be related to lower induction/expression of AP2 gene in the adipose cultures from corn supplemented group. Corn grain supplementation to steers grazing legumes could have stimulated more active adipogenic progenitor cells to differentiate, which would leave fewer behind in the SV pool for subsequent isolation.									2	0	0	2	0	2			2162-3945			MEDLINE:26317055	26317055	
J	Griffin, Michael P.; Callahan, Timothy J.; Vulava, Vijay M.; Williams, Thomas M.								Storm-event flow pathways in lower coastal plain forested watersheds of the southeastern United States								WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH				50	10			8265	8280		10.1002/2014WR015941			OCT 2014	2014	The landscape of the coastal plain of the southeastern United States is rapidly changing due to urbanization and climate-change-related impacts. In addition to the forecasted population increase, this region could experience significant changes in precipitation patterns making watershed management very challenging. In order to establish baseline data, storm-event flow pathways were studied in three lower coastal plain (LCP) forested lowland watersheds of the southeastern United States between 2010 and 2011. Two of the watersheds had clay loam subsoils while the third had sandy soils throughout the profile. Stream flow and water samples from water-table wells, piezometers, lysimeters, and rain gauges were analyzed for ion concentrations; ion trends were assessed using principal components analysis; and chemical hydrograph separation was performed for nine storm events using end-member mixing analysis. End-members consisted of lower concentration rainwater; a near-stream source (riparian or streambed groundwater); and a distant or deep groundwater source. Storm-event stream water on the clayey sites was composed primarily of rainwater (45-67% by volume) and shallow groundwater (21-55%), with small inputs from deep (below the clay-rich soil horizon) groundwater (0.2-21%). At the sandy site, a greater proportion was groundwater (56-61%), with smaller inputs from rainwater (28-33%) and soil water (6-16%). Dry antecedent soil moisture (ASM) conditions and larger storms resulted in greater rainwater contribution at the clayey sites. Shallow groundwater was an important contributor even in dry ASM conditions, perhaps due to the high specific retention of the soils. The results from this study will inform researchers about stormwater routing in forested, shallow water table watersheds and provide land managers with baseline data as they plan stormwater mitigation practices.Key Points<list id="wrcr21175-list-0001" list-type="bulleted"> <list-item id="wrcr21175-li-0001">Rainfall-stream flow response in coastal plain watersheds is clarified <list-item id="wrcr21175-li-0002">Soil type and antecedent moisture strongly influenced stream response to storms <list-item id="wrcr21175-li-0003">Data can assist management and planning for land use change impacts. <doi origin="wiley" registered="yes">10.1002/(ISSN)1944-7973</doi									0	0	0	0	0	0			0043-1397	1944-7973		WOS:000344783800043

The majority of blood Pb levels (95 %) were below background exposure levels. Species was a significant factor in ranked means analysis for mean blood Pb levels. Fewer individual blood Cd levels (< 60 %) were within background exposure levels and species was not significant. Elevated levels of Cd have been documented in other seabird species without apparent outward effects, which suggests that seabirds may be adapted to high cadmium environments, particularly from their diets. Overall, the results suggest Pb and Cd are not primary causes for concern in these seabirds.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0007-4861	1432-0800		WOS:000341827100007	25149279

The 48-h LC50 was 4.5 mg/L TiO2 NPs, whereas LC50 values for 7 and 14-days exposures were 2.7 and 1.9 mg/L, respectively. An exposure of 1.5 mg/L over a 21-days exposure resulted in significant reductions in fecundity. While reproduction was initially reduced in the 0.5 and 1.0 mg/L exposures, it recovered and was similar to the control by 21 days. For reproduction inhibition, NOEC was 1.0 mg/L. Exposure to 2.5 mg/L TiO2 NPs resulted in 40 % of the organisms failing to become gravid; all surviving organisms exposed to 5.0 mg/L failed to become gravid. The increased sensitivity was due to the refinement in the bioassay system that kept NP in suspension resulting in consistent exposure concentrations.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0007-4861	1432-0800		WOS:000341827100014	24845425

Thus, this group is an excellent model with which to analyse the evolution of these important characteristics, which are of interest not only in shrimps specifically but also in animal taxa in general. Yet, there exists no phylogenetic hypothesis, either molecular or morphological, for this taxon against which to test either the evolution of behavioural traits within the Rhynchocinetidae or its genealogical relationships with other caridean taxa. In this study, we tested (1) hypotheses on the phylogenetic relationships of rhynchocinetid shrimps, and (2) the efficacy of different (one-, two-, and three-phase) methods to generate a reliable phylogeny. Total genomic DNA was extracted from tissue samples taken from 17 species of Rhynchocinetidae and five other species currently or previously assigned to the same superfamily (Nematocarcinoidea); six species from other superfamilies were used as outgroups. Sequences from two nuclear genes (H3 and Enolase) and one mitocliondrial gene (12S) were used to construct phylogenies. One-phase playlogenetic analyses (SATe-II) and classical two- and three-phase playlogenetic analyses were employed, using both maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods. Both a two-gene data set (H3 and Enolase) and a three-gene data set (H3, Enolase, 12S) were utilized to explore the relationships amongst the targeted species. These analyses showed that the superfamily Nematocarcinoidea, as currently accepted, is polyphyletic. Furthermore, the two major clades recognized by the SATe-II analysis are clearly concordant with the genera Rhynchocinetes and Cinetorhynchus, which are currently recognized in the morphological-based classification (implicit phylogeny) as composing the family Rhynchocinetidae. The SATe-II method is considered superior to the other phylogenetic analyses employed, which failed to recognize these two major clades. Studies using more genes and a more complete species data set are needed to test yet unresolved inter- and intrafamilial systematic and evolutionary questions about this remarkable clade of caridean shrimps.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0024-4082	1096-3642		WOS:000342827000006

Event study results show persistent negative abnormal returns for long-term SEO aftermarket performance. After isolating "strategic" option exercises of REIT insiders around the SEO, we assess whether REIT insiders can benefit from asymmetric information. We find enhanced exercise activity around the SEO consistent with REIT executives acting on insider information that the REIT is overvalued at the SEO. However, when exercise activity is linked to long-term performance, the results show that REIT insiders are not especially skilled in identifying which SEOs will underperform.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0896-5803			WOS:000348265800004

However, there is some disagreement among the researchers. Many authors suggest that the impact of TQM on innovation depends both on the TQM dimensions considered and on the type of innovation. This paper aims at identifying elements of TQM as determinants of innovation outputs of organizations. The conceptual model proposed considers 8 TQM variables (leadership; customer focus; involvement and development of people; management by processes; continuous improvement; relations with suppliers; measuring results; product design) as factors that can have impact on 6 innovation outputs (research, development and technological innovation; product innovation; process innovation; organizational innovation; management innovation; marketing innovation). This study is based on empirical data collected through a questionnaire answered by 218 ISO 9001: 2008 certified organizations. Generally, it is possible to conclude that the adoption of TQM principles plays a key role in innovation activities. The investigation has interesting practical implications practice. Therefore, the adoption of certain organizational principles can encourage the development of innovation.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1806-4892			WOS:000348584800004

The species is chromosomally cohesive from Austria to Spain, and is characterized by a chromocenter, two unique fixed inversions, 10 unique autosomal polymorphisms, and undifferentiated sex chromosomes. Rare individuals (3%) have two types of supernumerary chromosomes, representing the third example of a simuliid species that carries two different supernumeraries in the same individuals.

In recent years, agricultural weed research addressing these two aims has effectively split into separate subdisciplines despite repeated calls for greater integration. Although some excellent work is being done, agricultural weed research has developed a very high level of repetitiveness, a preponderance of purely descriptive studies, and has failed to clearly articulate novel hypotheses linked to established bodies of ecological and evolutionary theory. In contrast, invasive plant research attracts a diverse cadre of nonweed scientists using invasions to explore broader and more integrated biological questions grounded in theory. We propose that although studies focused on weed management remain vitally important, agricultural weed research would benefit from deeper theoretical justification, a broader vision, and increased collaboration across diverse disciplines. To initiate change in this direction, we call for more emphasis on interdisciplinary training for weed scientists, and for focused workshops and working groups to develop specific areas of research and promote interactions among weed scientists and with the wider scientific community.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0043-1745	1550-2759		WOS:000346362900013

We found that the relative importance assigned to fruit quality and tree traits by producers varied across producers' end markets. Fresh peach producers indicated fruit flavor and size were the most important fruit quality traits, whereas processed peach producers viewed fruit size, fruit firmness, and absence of split pits as being the most important traits for a successful peach cultivar. These results have potential to ensure that peach breeding programs are consonant with fresh and processed peach producers' needs for fruit and tree traits.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0018-5345	2327-9834		WOS:000345254400011

The updated finite element (FE) models obtained through the proposed technique can aid in the analysis and design of structural systems. The authors developed a stochastic model updating method integrating distance discrimination analysis (DDA) and advanced Monte Carlo (MC) technique to (1) enable more efficient MC by using a response surface model, (2) calibrate parameters with an iterative test-analysis correlation based upon DDA, and (3) utilize and compare different distance functions as correlation metrics. Using DDA, the influence of distance functions on model updating results is analyzed. The proposed stochastic method makes it possible to obtain a precise model updating outcome with acceptable calculation cost. The stochastic method is demonstrated on a helicopter case study updated using both Euclidian and Mahalanobis distance metrics. It is observed that the selected distance function influences the iterative calibration process and thus, the calibration outcome, indicating that an integration of different metrics might yield improved results.

J	Tams, Stefan; Hill, Kevin; de Guinea, Ana Ortiz; Thatcher, Jason; Grover, Varun								NeuroIS-Alternative or Complement to Existing Methods? Illustrating the Holistic Effects of Neuroscience and Self-Reported Data in the Context of Technostress Research								JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS				15	10			723	753					OCT 2014	2014	Recent research has made a strong case for the importance of NeuroIS methods for IS research. It has suggested that NeuroIS contributes to an improved explanation and prediction of IS phenomena. Yet, such research is unclear on the source of this improvement; while some studies indicate that NeuroIS constitutes an alternative to psychometrics, implying that the two methods assess the same dimension of an underlying IS construct, other studies indicate that NeuroIS constitutes a complement to psychometrics, implying that the two methods assess different dimensions of an IS construct. To clarify the role of NeuroIS in IS research and its contribution to IS research, in this study, we examine whether NeuroIS and psychometrics/psychological methods constitute alternatives or complements. We conduct this examination in the context of technostress, an emerging IS phenomenon to which both methods are relevant. We use the triangulation approach to explore the relationship between physiological and psychological/self-reported data. Using this approach, we argue that both kinds of data tap into different aspects of technostress and that, together, they can yield a more complete or holistic understanding of the impact of technostress on a theoretically-related outcome, rendering them complements. Then, we test this proposition empirically by probing the correlation between a psychological and a physiological measure of technostress in combination with an examination of their incremental validity in explaining performance on a computer-based task. The results show that the physiological stress measure (salivary alpha-amylase) explains and predicts variance in performance on the computer-based task over and above the prediction afforded by the self-reported stress measure. We conclude that NeuroIS is a critical complement to IS research.									9	0	0	0	0	9			1536-9323	1558-3457		WOS:000345064000004

Testing the fourth moment approximation of vibrational mode lifetimes in fcc Lennard-Jonesium								MODELLING AND SIMULATION IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING				22	7					075011	10.1088/0965-0393/22/7/075011			OCT 2014	2014	A recently proposed method of approximating the vibrational mode lifetimes in insulators is based on ensemble averages of displacements and forces. In this report, the so-called 'fourth-moment approximation' is tested against the conventional 'ensemble molecular dynamics' method on vibrational modes in fcc 'Lennard-Jonesium'. Cells of 4, 8, 16, and 32 atoms are used as a testbed for comparing the two methods. The results show that the moments method gives a quite reasonable accounting of the vibrational mode lifetimes in these cells at all temperatures and is orders of magnitude faster than the MD-based approach.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0965-0393	1361-651X		WOS:000344946700011

To reduce these losses and minimize control costs, new methods to detect pests and/or pest damage must be investigated in order to optimize control measures. One such method evaluated in this study was to detect the chemicals released by pests or pest-damaged products. A portable device was developed to draw volatiles from pests or pest-damaged products over carbon black-polymer composite sensors and measure the change in resistance for each sensor. The device successfully sampled pest and plant volatiles and these volatiles were detected using carbon black-polymer composite sensors. These results indicated an electronic nose is a feasible approach to detect pests and/or pest damage. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Ferrand, Yann B.; Magazine, Michael J.; Rao, Uday S.								Partially Flexible Operating Rooms for Elective and Emergency Surgeries								DECISION SCIENCES				45	5			819	847		10.1111/deci.12096			OCT 2014	2014	In hospitals, the management of operating rooms faces a trade-off between the need to be responsive to emergency surgeries and to conduct scheduled elective surgeries efficiently. Operating rooms can be configured as flexible and handle both electives and emergencies, or as dedicated to focus on either electives or emergencies. With flexible rooms, the prioritization of emergencies over scheduled electives can lead to schedule disruptions. Focused rooms can lead to imbalances between capacity and surgery workload. Whereas hospital administrators typically handle this trade-off by employing either flexible rooms (complete flexibility) or dedicated rooms (complete focus), we investigate whether a combination of flexible and dedicated rooms (partial flexibility) could be a preferable alternative. The ensuing question is what is the right combination of flexible and dedicated rooms? A versatile simulation model is developed to evaluate different resource allocation policies under various environmental parameters and performance metrics, including patient wait time, staff overtime, and operating room utilization. The main result is that partial flexibility configurations outperform both complete flexibility and complete focus policies by providing solutions with improved values of expected wait time for both emergency and elective patients.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0011-7315	1540-5915		WOS:000344474200001

Coupled wave equations are derived to correlate the geometrical discontinues associated with the CCBG structure with the energy coupling that occurs between the forward and backward propagating waves along the CCBG. This paper provides a novel approach to model the coupling coefficient that results in a simplified form of the coupled wave equations. The finite-difference method is used to solve the coupled wave equations numerically. Further, based on the dielectric distortion assumption, the closed-form solution of the CCBG problem has been given. The reflection and transmission spectra of a CCBG sample are calculated numerically and analytically, and are validated by 3-D full-wave electromagnetic simulations, as well as experimental results.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0018-9480	1557-9670		WOS:000344990600005

Two plasma regimes were found to exist in the same plasma structure under changes of gas flow rate and applied voltage conditions: the flame plasma regime and the trident plasma regime. When the gas flow rate and applied voltage were at low values, the flame glow plasma was produced, whereas the trident glow plasma was produced when the gas flow rate and applied voltage were at high values. Under identical electrical driving and gas conditions in each plasma regimes, the optical intensity of the trident plasma regime was approximately two times larger than the flame plasma regime. This highly energetic trident plasma jet is useful in developing novel applications requiring strong atmospheric pressure discharge processes by using very simplified structures, easy fabrication, potable and light weight, wide area, patterning generation, and low manufacturing and maintenance cost compared with the vacuum plasmas.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0093-3813	1939-9375		WOS:000344548300081

Even though the selected poultry medium had a complex geometry, DBD was easily created due to the high flexibility of the tubing and metal wire. DBD was produced at the peak voltage of 7.5 kV (V-pp of 15 kV) and frequency of 32 kHz. It is expected, from the emission spectrum of the plasma, that chemical reaction of the hydroxyl and nitrogen species within the plasma can effectively sterilize the poultry sample. Consequently, this fast reaction at room temperature makes plasma sterilization a viable alternative to conventional food sterilization processes.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0093-3813	1939-9375		WOS:000344548300217

The coupled use of polyethylenimine and ammonium hydroxide provided a direct method for growing vertically well-aligned ZnO nanorods with a high aspect ratio. Using mica as a substrate material enabled thermal annealing processes, which improved the structural and optical properties of ZnO nanorods with uniform surface coverage and excellent adhesion, increased transmittance of indium tin oxide (ITO)/mica (52%), and decreased sheet resistance of ITO/mica (80%). We have fabricated ZnO nanorod-based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and piezoelectric nanogenerators (NGs) and investigated their annealing effects on the device performances. Specifically, the thermal treatment at 500 degrees C for 30 min increased the energy conversion efficiencies of DSSCs by 53%. Furthermore, we observed a three-fold increase in the NG's output voltage and output current density through this thermal annealing process. As shown below, mica, which can function under extremes of temperature, is useful as a substrate for flexible and transparent electronics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Short-term Response of Breeding Birds to Oak Regeneration Treatments in Upland Hardwood Forest								NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL				34	4			409	422		10.3375/043.034.0403			OCT 2014	2014	Population declines of several successional-scrub bird species are partly associated with decreased habitat availability as abandoned farmlands return to forest and recently harvested forests regrow. Restoration of mixed-oak (Quercus spp.) forest is also a concern because of widespread oak regeneration failure, especially on moist, productive sites where competition from faster-growing tree species is fierce following stand-replacing disturbances. Several silvicultural methods are proposed to promote oak regeneration but many are not experimentally tested, especially on productive sites. We surveyed birds in 19 stands to assess response to initial application of three proposed oak regeneration treatments on productive sites: prescribed burning (B); oak shelterwood by midstory herbicide (OSW); shelterwood harvests (SW); and controls (C), for one breeding season before, and two breeding seasons after, implementation. Relative density of successional-scrub species Indigo Buntings (Passerina cyanea), Eastern Towhees (Pipilo erythrophthalmus), and Chestnut-sided Warblers (Setophaga pensylvanica) increased, while Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla) decreased within 11 to 18 months after SW harvests; understory disturbance treatments B or OSW had no effect. Our results indicated that partial harvests created habitat for breeding birds associated with both young and mature forests, whereas understory treatments had little effect. Additionally, we show that even small patches of young forest habitat are used by more individuals and more species of breeding birds than surrounding closed-canopy forest, and may benefit successional-scrub species by enabling their occurrence in an otherwise forested landscape. Absence of several lower-elevation successional-scrub bird species in our mid-elevation SW harvests suggests that comprehensive conservation in the southern Appalachians necessitates creating and maintaining young forest habitats across elevation gradients.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0885-8608	2162-4399		WOS:000344601800003

A radar rainfall retrieval algorithm [Colorado State University-Hydrometeor Identification Rainfall Optimization (CSU-HIDRO)] served as the test bed. Subsequent investigations determined that the available field measurements, which were very limited in scope, of the fall velocity and axis ratio deviations indicated rain-rate estimation errors of approximately 20%. Based on these findings, a sensitivity study was then performed using uncorrelated fall velocity and axis ratio deviations around the predicted values. Significant rain-rate estimation errors were observed for the realistic combinations of fall velocity and axis ratio deviations. It was shown that the maximum rain-rate estimation error can reach up to approximately 200% for combinations of fall velocity and axis ratio deviations (5000 drop size distribution samples were simulated for each combination) between -10% and +10% of the predicted values for each. The maximum standard deviation of errors was as great as 75% for the same combinations of fall velocity and axis ratio deviations. The authors found that use of dual-polarization radars to accurately estimate rainfall, during natural rain events, also requires a reanalysis of the parameterizations for raindrop fall velocity and axis ratio. These parameterizations should consider both the coupling between these two parameters and factors that may introduce any possible deviations of the predicted values of these parameters.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1525-755X	1525-7541		WOS:000342964400008

The traditional clinical diagnosis of the toxic plants is inefficient, fallible, and dependent upon experts. In this study, we tested the performance of DNA barcodes for identification of the most threatening poisonous plants in China.Methods Seventy-four accessions of 27 toxic plant species in 22 genera and 17 families were sampled and three DNA barcodes (matK, rbcL, and ITS) were amplified, sequenced and tested. Three methods, Blast, pairwise global alignment (PWG) distance, and Tree-Building were tested for discrimination power.Results The primer universality of all the three markers was high. Except in the case of ITS for Hemerocallis minor, the three barcodes were successfully generated from all the selected species. Among the three methods applied, Blast showed the lowest discrimination rate, whereas PWG Distance and Tree-Building methods were equally effective. The ITS barcode showed highest discrimination rates using the PWG Distance and Tree-Building methods. When the barcodes were combined, discrimination rates were increased for the Blast method.Conclusion DNA barcoding technique provides us a fast tool for clinical identification of poisonous plants in China. We suggest matK, rbcL, ITS used in combination as DNA barcodes for authentication of poisonous plants.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0895-3988			WOS:000344175900006	25341815

Yet, the calculated failure probability can be sensitive to the probability model used, even if different models are calibrated based on the same data. The model selection uncertainty is a poorly understood area of research in current geotechnical practice. In this study, we show how to construct candidate probability models based upon the copula theory to more realistically model the soil data with explicit consideration of the possible non-linear dependence relationship between random variables. The authors used a Bayesian method to quantify the model selection uncertainty and to compare the validity of the candidate models. A model averaging method that combines predictions from competing models was then developed to deal with the situation when the effect of model selection uncertainty cannot be neglected. Averaging over the reliability index seems more plausible than averaging over the failure probability in geotechnical reliability analyses. To reduce the computational work, models with significantly less model probabilities can be removed from the model averaging process without an obvious effect on the prediction accuracy.

J	Chen, Kang; Shen, Haiying								SMART: Utilizing Distributed Social Map for Lightweight Routing in Delay-Tolerant Networks								IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING				22	5			1545	1558		10.1109/TNET.2013.2281583			OCT 2014	2014	Previous delay-tolerant network (DTN) routing algorithms exploit either past encounter records or social network properties to derive a node's probability of delivering packets to their destinations. However, they only have a local view of the network, which limits the routing efficiency. Also, when two nodes meet, they have to exchange the delivery abilities to the destinations of all packets in the two nodes, which incurs high resource consumption. In this paper, we propose SMART, which utilizes a distributed social map for lightweight routing in delay-tolerant networks. In SMART, each node builds its own social map consisting of nodes it has met and their frequently encountered nodes in a distributed manner. Based on both encountering frequency and social closeness of the two linked nodes in the social map, we decide the weight of each link to reflect the packet delivery ability between the two nodes. The social map enables more accurate forwarder selection through a broader view. Moreover, nodes exchange much less information for social map update, which reduces resource consumption. Trace-driven experiments and tests on the GENI ORBIT testbed demonstrate the high efficiency of SMART in comparison to previous algorithms.									5	1	0	0	0	5			1063-6692	1558-2566		WOS:000344157600013

The flexibility enabled with hybridization creates chances for a synergistic approach, in which the hybrid supervisory control can be augmented to address both the emissions and the efficiency. In this paper, two policy optimization techniques are proposed, namely stochastic dynamic programming and neurodynamic programming, for designing power management controllers. These controllers are then compared with a baseline rule-based controller. The intention is to investigate the additional benefits possible through application of policy optimization algorithms and a systematic framework capable of representing complex system-level effects. The power management of a series hydraulic hybrid vehicle is pursued as a sequential decision-making problem under uncertainty (stochastic control). The low energy density of the hydraulic accumulator adds to the control challenge. First, stochastic dynamic programming and neurodynamic programming are applied to design a controller based on the fuel economy objective. The problem is subsequently expanded to include minimization of transient diesel engine emissions. This poses additional challenges due to the increased state space. The problem is computationally intractable by stochastic dynamic programming and is solved using the newly proposed neurodynamic programming framework. Finally, the supervisory controllers are implemented and evaluated using simulations and an engine-in-the-loop facility. It is shown that, by designing an intelligent multi-objective controller, significant reduction in both the fuel consumption and the emissions can be achieved compared with strategies which focus solely on the fuel consumption.									5	1	0	0	0	6			0954-4070	2041-2991		WOS:000344243700004

Ring Compression Test for High-Temperature Glass Using the Generalized Navier Law								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CERAMIC SOCIETY				97	10			3257	3262		10.1111/jace.13138			OCT 2014	2014	Glass-forming processes such as high viscosity extrusion and Precision Glass Molding take place at temperatures where slip between the glass and mold/die surfaces is known to occur. Characterization of the frictional forces that accompany interface slip are essential in computational simulations of these processes for prediction of pressing time or force, distortion of the part and possible wear of expensive mold surfaces. In this study, the generalized Navier law, where the interface shear stress, , is related to the relative sliding speed of the glass on the mold surface, v(s), by =kv(s)(e), is used in simulations of the ring compression test to produce friction calibration curves. Contrary to the nonlinear form of the Navier law, the linear form, just like the Coulomb friction model, leads to calibration curves that are loading rate and material behavior independent. This independence is achieved by normalizing the Navier friction coefficient with the viscosity. Friction calibration curves for the normalized coefficient are characterized for the full range of interface conditions from no-slip to no friction. The results showed an approximate one-to-one correspondence between the normalized Navier coefficient and the Coulomb friction coefficient for the full range of axial deformation in the ring compression test.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000343829900036		
J	Wright, Kathleen M.; Britt, Thomas W.; Moore, DeWayne								Impediments to Mental Health Treatment as Predictors of Mental Health Symptoms Following Combat								JOURNAL OF TRAUMATIC STRESS				27	5			535	541		10.1002/jts.21946			OCT 2014	2014	This longitudinal study examined whether impediments to mental health treatment would predict changes in mental health symptoms (posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD] and depression) in the months following soldiers returning from combat. Three-hundred ten combat veterans completed measures of impediments to treatment and measures of PTSD and depression symptoms at 2, 3, and 4 months following a 15-month combat deployment. Structural equation modeling revealed that greater impediments (a latent variable indexed by stigma, practical barriers, and negative treatment attitudes) at 2 months predicted increased PTSD and depression symptoms from 2-3 months ( = .14) and greater impediments at 3 months predicted increased symptoms from 3-4 months ( = .26). In contrast, evidence was not obtained for the opposite causal direction of symptoms predicting higher levels of impediments at the different periods. Possible mechanisms for the predictive effects of impediments are discussed.Resumen Este estudio longitudinal examino si los impedimentos (obstaculos) al tratamiento de salud mental predicen los cambios en los sintomas de salud mental (TEPT y depresion) en los meses posteriores al retorno de combate en soldados. Un total de 310 ex combatientes completaron las medidas de impedimentos (obstaculos) para el tratamiento y las medidas de sintomas de TEPT y depresion 2, 3 y 4 meses posteriores a 15 meses de servicio de combate. El modelo de ecuacion estructural revelo que a mayores impedimentos (una variable latente indexada por estigma, barreras practicas y actitudes negativas al tratamiento) a los 2 meses, predijeron un aumento de sintomas de TEPT y depresion de 2 a 3 meses (r=.14) y mayores impedimentos a los 3 meses predijeron un aumento de los sintomas de 3 a 4 meses (r=.26). Por el contrario, no se obtuvo evidencia para el efecto causal opuesto de los sintomas prediciendo mayores niveles de impedimentos en los diferentes periodos de tiempo. Los posibles mecanismos para los efectos predictivos de los impedimentos son discutidos.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0894-9867	1573-6598		WOS:000343928000005	25322883

Investigation of spectrochemical matrix effects in the liquid sampling-atmospheric pressure glow discharge source								SPECTROCHIMICA ACTA PART B-ATOMIC SPECTROSCOPY				100				44	51		10.1016/j.sab.2014.08.006			OCT 1 2014	2014	The liquid sampling-atmospheric pressure glow discharge (LS-APGD) microplasma was evaluated with regard to its spectrochemical robustness in its application as a miniaturized optical emission spectroscopy (OES) source for liquid samples. The susceptibility to perturbations in excitation/ionization conditions was probed across a wide range test species, including transition metals, easily ionized elements (group I), and elements with low second ionization potentials (group II). Spectrochemical metrics included the plasma excitation temperature (T-exc), ionization temperatures (T-ion), and magnesium (Mg) ionic: atomic (Mg II:Mg I) ratios. The introduction of the 11 different matrix elements into the LS-APGD at concentrations of 500 mu g mL(-1) yielded no significant changes in the optically-determined plasma characteristics, indicating a relative immunity to spectrochemical matrix effects. T-exe values for the plasma, using He I as the spectrometric species averaged 2769 +/- 79 K across the test matrix, with Mg-based ionization temperature values centered at 6665 +/- 151 K. Typical Mg II:Mg I ratios (the so-called robustness parameter) were 0.95 +/- 03. The lack of appreciable perturbation in excitation/ionization conditions observed here is also manifested in virtually no changes in the probe Mg II and I species' intensities, even at matrix loadings of up to 1000 mu g mL(-1) of Ba. These observations indicate that the IS-APGD could serve as an OES source for the analysis of diverse aqueous samples without appreciable spectroscopic matrix effects, though potential physical matrix effects induding vaporization effects must be evaluated.

We discovered that founders enact distinctly different definitions of the adversity and use their firms as vehicles to defend who they are or to become who they want to be. Bridging two formerly disparate social psychological theories of identity, we develop grounded theory and a process model that together contribute toward our understanding of how and why differences in the structure of founder identity the set of identities that is chronically salient to a founder in her/his day-to-day work drive patterned differences in firms' strategic responses. The processes we describe help explain responses to adversity and also provide a platform for research that may generate new insights into the significance for founders of bringing "who I am" into closer alignment with "who I want to be."									16	0	0	0	0	16			0001-4273	1948-0989		WOS:000343641400009

Costs associated with mitigating the impacts on water quality of future development within the Reedy River watershed using various best management practices								ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING				71				326	334		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2014.07.030			OCT 2014	2014	This study was initiated to gain a better understanding of how patterns of development within Greenville, SC and its surrounding metro area would affect the Reedy River's water quality and thus costs associated any degradation that may occur. A previously prepared watershed-scale model was modified to yield quantity and quality data that would result from projected growth in Greenville through the year 2030 at three different growth scenarios.The major finding of the study was that water quality and quantity impacts are consistently higher for the 5:1 growth scenario as compared to the 1:1 scenario. As more land is developed in the 5:1 scenario, the amount of stormwater increases while water quality decreases. At Boyd Millpond by 2030, total costs for treatment of total phosphorus and total nitrogen loads resulting from newly developed lands' stormwater contributions could range from $8 to 1000 million. Results are similar by 2030 for the flow entering Lake Greenwood from the Reedy River Arm. Costs for potential treatment of total phosphorus at this location could range from $10 to 263 million.The cost implications of dealing with water quantity and quality impacts of varying growth scenarios suggest an obvious need for proactive planning and action when it comes to management of nutrients associated with stormwater from future developments within an area.

J	Beebe, Donald A.; Castle, James W.; Molz, J.; Rodgers, John H., Jr.								Effects of evapotranspiration on treatment performance in constructed wetlands: Experimental studies and modeling								ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING				71				394	400		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2014.07.052			OCT 2014	2014	Evapotranspiration (ET) can affect treatment performance on constructed wetlands by enhancing constituent transport through the hydrosoil where treatment reactions occur. Additionally, ET can decrease volumetric flow thereby increasing hydraulic retention time and increasing concentrations of dissolved constituents. This research aims to assess the net effects of water loss attributed to ET on constructed wetland performance and determine the significance of plant transpiration on vertical transport of constituents. A flowing wetland lysimeter constructed using 265-L storage containers filled with sand and Typha latifolia was used to record ET and determine crop coefficient during summer 2011. Results indicate that ET from the lysimeter was 2.5 times greater than calculated reference ET (K-c = 2.5; R-2 = 0.96). The calculated crop coefficient was used in conjunction with a first-order tank-in-series model to predict removal of a conservative constituent (k= 0.2 d(-1)) and readily treatable constituent (k =1.2 d(-1)) in a constructed wetland (20 cm and 40 cm water depths, 4-day nominal HRT, and 100 mg L-1 constituent loading) operating under a range of ET (0, 10, 20, and 30 mm d(-1)). The model predicts that removal efficiency of the conservative constituent decreases with increasing ET, while removal efficiency of the readily treatable constituent increases with increasing ET. In addition, eight vertical tracer tests were performed on wetland cells with either trimmed or untrimmed T. latifolia to measure transport time of tracer solution from the water surface to a depth of 5 cm. Mean tracer arrival time differed significantly (p =1.2 x 10(-8)) between the untrimmed and trimmed cells (104 min versus 450 min, respectively) demonstrating that plant transpiration contributes significantly to vertical flow through hydrosoil.

CO2 assisted mechanical expression of fat from rendered materials								JOURNAL OF SUPERCRITICAL FLUIDS				94				154	159		10.1016/j.supflu.2014.07.002			OCT 2014	2014	This work employs liquid and supercritical carbon dioxide for the enhanced expression of fat from rendered materials, specifically a finished poultry meal. Current industrial rendering processes use continuous screw presses or expellers to remove fats from rendered materials; however, this process can leave 10 to 15% residual fat. The higher economic value for the fat and emerging markets for low fat rendered protein meals makes enhanced fat recovery desirable. Results from this work demonstrate the use of CO2 assisted mechanical expression where the rendered material is pressed in the presence of pressurized CO2. The fat content of the poultry meal was reduced from an initial 12.1% down to 2.3% after pressing. The optimal conditions for a maximum expression were on the order of 40 degrees C, 210 bar of CO2, and 500 bar of effective mechanical pressure. An optimum effective mechanical pressure was observed at around 500 bar, which can be attributed to a reduced permeability of the CO2-fat mixture through the protein matrix at high mechanical pressures, as described by Darcy's law. At CO2 pressures greater than 172 bar, expression enhancement is negligible, likely due to a plateau reached for the viscosity of the oil-CO2 mixture beyond such pressure. The primary mechanisms governing the enhanced expression were the reduced viscosity of the fat with CO2 dissolution; which increases the drainage of fat through the cake, and the confinement rupture due to swelling upon CO2 dissolution. Overall, it was demonstrated that high expression yields can be achieved when conducting a gas-assisted mechanical expression of rendered materials, using only a fraction of the amount of CO2 used for CO2-only extractions. Furthermore, the optimum operating conditions are suitable for application in screw presses or expellers currently used on industrial scales. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, tropomyosin (TM) - the primary allergen in octopus - was purified from Octopus fangsiao following different food processing treatments. The changes in the allergenicity and digestibility of different TM samples were estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunological experiments. The results showed that TM was resistant to pepsin but not to trypsin or alpha-chymotrypsin. Compared with crude TM, the TM treated by ultrasound-heat (UH) and ultraviolet radiation (UVR) showed no significant change in IgG/IgE-binding ability, except high pressure steaming (HP). And the resistance of the treated TM to digestive enzymes was reduced, with HP-treated TM showing the most significant change in stability. It was different that the resistance of TM to the digestive enzymes was increased after treatment with the Maillard reaction (MR); the IgG/IgE-binding activities of the MR products were almost completely eliminated. Thus, all of these results show that the immunoreactivity of octopus TM can be reduced by HP and MR treatment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In response, this study compares the competitive priorities and capabilities of small- and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises in Brazil. Using a large-scale survey, it assesses the impact of measuring competitive priorities vs. capabilities and examines how competitive priorities are shaped. First, findings support the argument that tradeoff decisions in these firms are better captured by measuring competitive capabilities than by measuring competitive priorities. Second, competitive priorities appear to be shaped more by the business environment than by capabilities. Meanwhile, competitive capabilities appear to be shaped more by priorities than by the business environment. However, for the studied enterprises, capabilities appear not completely deliberate or aligned with priorities, leaving scope for future research. Cluster analysis then identified a group of firms that rate all competitive priorities as high yet have low competitive capabilities. These companies seem to have no clear strategy. The best performing cluster of companies had strong capabilities in terms of delivery, quality, and innovativeness rather than cost. This provides an indication as to which capabilities small- and medium-sized enterprises need to develop in order to succeed in the current business environment.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0268-3768	1433-3015		WOS:000343048300003

Finishing steers grazed mixed pastures (bluegrass/white clover; April start) and were slaughtered after 89-, 146-, and 201-d TOP. At 24 h postmortem, carcass traits were collected and a rib from each carcass was obtained for proximate and fatty acid composition, Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF), and postmortem proteolysis. In yr 1, postmortem aging treatments included 14 and 28 d, whereas in yr 2, postmortem aging treatments included 2, 4, 7, 14, and 28 d. Increasing frame size of the finishing steers produced greater (P < 0.05) ADG by 0.10 kg, BW by 24 kg, HCW by 14 kg, and ribeye size by 2.65 cm(2). All other carcass, meat composition, and tenderness measures did not differ (P > 0.05) due to frame size or 2-way interaction with TOP. Increasing TOP resulted in quadratic increases (P < 0.01) in BW and HCW. Ribeye area, fat thickness, KPH, marbling scores, quality grades, and yield grades increased (P < 0.001) linearly as TOP increased. Time-on-pasture linearly increased (P = 0.001) palmitic (C16:0) acid, oleic (C18:1 cis-9) acid, SFA, and MUFA in the LM. Both n-6 PUFA, linoleic (C18:2) and arachidonic (C20:4) acids, decreased linearly (P = 0.001) with increasing TOP. Increasing TOP linearly reduced (P = 0.01) concentrations of all n-3 fatty acids in the LM. These changes resulted in a linear reduction (P = 0.01) in n-6 to n-3 fatty acid ratio with advancing TOP; however, the magnitude of the difference was small (1.46 vs. 1.37). At 14 d of postmortem aging, WBSF was lowest (P < 0.001) for 89-d TOP and greatest (P < 0.05) for the 201-d TOP. After 28 d of postmortem aging, WBSF values for 89- and 146-d TOP did not differ (P > 0.05) compared to the 14-d postmortem aging WBSF values. However, in steaks from 201-d TOP, additional postmortem aging to 28 d reduced (P < 0.001) WBSF. In pasture-based beef finishing systems, increasing TOP increases animal age, HCW, fat thickness, and marbling score; however, tenderness of ribeye steaks decreased with advanced TOP such that longer postmortem aging times were required to achieve similar tenderness levels.									5	0	0	4	0	5			0021-8812	1525-3163		WOS:000343109300051	25267999

The structures of the five compounds are described in space group R (3) over bar: Tl7Th6F31 with a = 15.598(2) and c = 10.893(2), (NH4)(7)Th6F31 with a = 15.5979(2) and c = 10.952(2), K7Ce6F31 with a = 15.013(2) and c = 10.295(2), (NH4)(7)Ce6F31 with a = 15.232(2) and c = 10.749(2), and Na7Ce6F31 with a = 14.567(2) and c = 9.6921(19). Comparison of these materials was made based on their structures and synthesis conditions. The formation of these species in hydrothermal fluids appears to be largely dependent upon the concentration of the monovalent fluoride mineralizer solution and thus, the ratio of monovalent ions to thorium or cerium in the system. The crystal chemistry of the A(7)B(6)F(31) (A = Na+, K+, Rb+, Tl+, NH4+; B = Zr-4(+), Ce-4(+), Th-4(+)) structure type is described by examining the title compounds alongside other isomorphs to gain a broader understanding of the crystallization of complex fluorides. Structural subtleties are also discussed, including substitutional disorder of Na+ and Ce-4(+) cations in Na7Ce6F31.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1074-1542	1572-8854		WOS:000343218200001

J	May, Todd								GENEALOGY, PROBLEMATIZATION, AND NORMATIVITY IN MICHEL FOUCAULT								HISTORY AND THEORY				53	3			419	427		10.1111/hith.10721			OCT 2014	2014	Colin Koopman's excellent Genealogy as Critique argues that Michel Foucault's genealogies-and, in fact, his archaeologies-should be read as historical accounts of the emergence of particular "problematizations." The idea of a problematization, which Foucault introduces late in his career, has two sides. First, there is the idea that the situation whose emergence a genealogy traces is problematic in the sense of being fraught or dangerous. Second, by tracing the genealogy, Foucault problematizes the situation itself, showing how it calls for attention. Koopman argues that Foucault's genealogies are not themselves normative, but they instead outline situations or practices in a way that allows for normative investigation and political intervention. What is required, then, are normative approaches that complement Foucault's genealogies. Koopman argues that Foucault's own late discussions of self-transformation are inadequate to fully accomplish the task; they need to be complemented by recourse to Deweyan reconstruction or Habermasian normative reflection. However, and in turn, such reflection cannot be had on an absolutist ground but rather must be seen as historically contingent, universalizing rather than universalist in Koopman's vocabulary. I argue that there are several reasons to think that the strong separation between genealogy and normative posited by Koopman may be too strict. Foucault's rhetoric, his choice of certain problematizations, and Koopman's own commitments to problematizations as requiring attention all seem to point toward a more intimate, although admittedly implicit, relation between genealogy and normative positions in Foucault's work.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0018-2656	1468-2303		WOS:000342896000007

These treatments typically require repeated doses administered by injection. Alternate routes of administration, particularly oral, are considered favorable because of improved convenience and compliance by patients, but physiological barriers such as extreme pH level, enzyme degradation, and poor intestinal epithelium permeability limit absorption. Encapsulating biologics in drug delivery systems such as polymeric nanoparticles prevents inactivation and degradation caused by low pH and enzymes of the gastrointestinal tract. However, transport across the intestinal epithelium remains the most critical barrier to overcome for efficient oral delivery. This review focuses on recent advances in polymeric nanoparticles being developed to overcome transport barriers and their potential for translation into clinical use.									17	1	0	13	0	17			1542-3565	1542-7714		WOS:000342625000010	24981782

In this regard, we present a reliability based robust design optimization approach to achieve designs that are not only safe and cost efficient, but also robust against uncertainties. The aim here is to adjust easy-to-control design parameters to reduce the variability of the seismic response to hard-to-control noise parameters while also considering design safety and budget. The proposed approach is demonstrated with a steel moment resisting frame design, considering uncertainties and spatial variability in connection parameters. Here, the sizes of the steel sections constitute the design parameters, while the uncertain and spatially variable parameters of the Ibarra-Krawinkler connection model are treated as noise parameters. The design objectives include the collapse prevention reliability conditional on a maximum earthquake intensity level, as well as the initial cost of the structure. To reduce computation demands in calculating the seismic response variation, design parameters that have a negligible effect on seismic response are first eliminated through sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, the seismic response variation is evaluated parametrically to investigate the effect of connection parameter spatial variability. Finally, the authors demonstrate the use of proposed robust design optimization approach to obtain a Pareto Front, a collection of optimal designs that are optimized for both reliability and cost.

Hsein				Wang, Lei/M-6627-2015				Robust design of rock slopes with multiple failure modes: modeling uncertainty of estimated parameter statistics with fuzzy number								ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES				72	8			2957	2969		10.1007/s12665-014-3201-1			OCT 2014	2014	The variability of shear characteristics of rock discontinuities is often difficult to ascertain. Thus, even with the reliability-based design (RBD) approach, which allows for consideration of the uncertainty of input parameters, the design of a rock slope system may be either cost-inefficient (overdesign) or unsafe (under-design), depending on whether the variation of input parameters is overestimated or underestimated. The uncertainty about the variation of input parameters is a critical issue in a RBD. This paper presents a feasible approach to addressing this problem using robust design concept. First, the uncertainty of the estimated statistics of input parameters (such as rock properties) is represented by fuzzy sets, which requires only the knowledge of lower and upper bounds of the estimated statistics. Then, the robust design concept is implemented to ensure that the final design is insensitive to, or robust against, the uncertainty of the estimated statistics of input parameters. The design methodology is demonstrated with an application to the design of a rock slope system with multiple failure modes. This design methodology, termed robust geotechnical design (RGD), aims to achieve a certain level of design robustness, in addition to meeting safety and cost requirements. In this paper, the RGD framework is realized through a multi-objective optimization, as it involves three requirements, safety, cost, and robustness. The significance of the design methodology is demonstrated with an example of rock slope design.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1866-6280	1866-6299		WOS:000342494100018		
J	Horing, Bjoern; Weimer, Katja; Muth, Eric R.; Enck, Paul								Prediction of placebo responses: a systematic review of the literature								FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				5						1079	10.3389/fpsyg.2014.01079			OCT 1 2014	2014	Objective: Predicting who responds to placebo treatment and under which circumstances has been a question of interest and investigation for generations. However, the literature is disparate and inconclusive. This reviewaims to identify publications that provide high quality data on the topic of placebo response (PR) prediction.Methods: To identify studies concerned with PR prediction, independent searches were performed in an expert database (for all symptom modalities) and in PubMed (for pain only). Articles were selected when (a) they assessed putative predictors prior to placebo treatment and (b) an adequate control group was included when the associations of predictors and PRs were analyzed.Results: Twenty studies were identified, most with pain as dependent variable. Most predictors of PRs were psychological constructs related to actions, expected outcomes and the emotional valence attached to these events (goal-seeking, self-efficacy/-esteem, locus of control, optimism). Other predictors involved behavioral control (desire for control, eating restraint), personality variables (fun seeking, sensation seeking, neuroticism), or biological markers (sex, a single nucleotide polymorphism related to dopamine metabolism). Finally, suggestibility and beliefs in expectation biases, body consciousness, and baseline symptom severity were found to be predictive.Conclusions: While results are heterogeneous, some congruence of predictors can be identified. PRs mainly appear to be moderated by expectations of how the symptom might change after treatment, or expectations of how symptom repetition can be coped with. It is suggested to include the listed constructs in future research. Furthermore, a closer look at variables moderating symptom change in control groups seems warranted.									13	0	0	7	0	13			1664-1078			WOS:000342683700001	25324797

However, they are either fast but insecure or cryptographic secure but slow. To integrate them together, in this paper we present a new family of square random functions, including SqHash, SqMAC and SqPRG, based on a specially truncated function (MSB or LSB), as well as circular convolution with carry bits. Provable security is provided by the privacy property in hidden number problem and Hard-core unpredication of one-way function. The experiment results show that these schemes have better performance under different input and output lengths. We also perform four types of statistical tests for randomness. The experiments indicate that our construction has good average-case randomness than SHA-2 and original Square algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

(D. candidum) is a traditional Chinese medicine widely used in Asia. The present study has showed that D. candidum exerted an anti-metastatic effect in mice injected with 26-M3.1 colon carcinoma cells. D. candidum showed the most marked tumor inhibitory rate of 64.5% at a dose of 400 mg/kg body weight (b.w). The mRNA and protein expression of Bax in lung tissue of D. candidum-treated mice was shown to be higher as compared with control mice, whereas the mRNA and protein expression of Bcl-2 showed the opposite trend. Decreased mRNA and protein expression of MMP and increased expression of TIMPs was demonstrated in lung tissues by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot assays. D. candidum reduced the serum cytokine levels of IL-6, IL-12, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma to a greater extent as compared with the control mice, and administration of 400 mg/kg b.w. resulted in a lower serum cytokine levels as compared with mice treated with 200 mg/kg b.w. Eleven compounds were in the D. candidum leaf, of which the functional contents may help to generate novel treatments for the prevention of lung metastases. The results of the present study have demonstrated that D. candidum had a potent in vivo antitumor and anti-metastatic effect in BALB/c mice injected with 26-M3.1 cells.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1792-1074	1792-1082		WOS:000342725400091

Alginate hydrogels have been used extensively as bioinks for 3-D bioprinting. However, most previous research has focused on native alginates with limited degradation. The application of oxidized alginates with controlled degradation in bioprinting has not been explored. Here, a collection of 30 different alginate hydrogels with varied oxidation percentages and concentrations was prepared to develop a bioink platform that can be applied to a multitude of tissue engineering applications. The authors systematically investigated the effects of two key material properties (i.e. viscosity and density) of alginate solutions on their printabilities to identify a suitable range of material properties of alginates to be applied to bioprinting. Further, four alginate solutions with varied biodegradability were printed with human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) into lattice-structured, cell-laden hydrogels with high accuracy. Notably, these alginate-based bioinks were shown to be capable of modulating proliferation and spreading of hADSCs without affecting the structure integrity of the lattice structures (except the highly degradable one) after 8 days in culture. This research lays a foundation for the development of alginate-based bioink for tissue-specific tissue engineering applications. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Microbiological analyses were performed on environmental samples collected from child care facilities in North and South Carolina.Methods: There were 326 samples collected from 40 facilities corresponding to common surfaces (77% of samples) and the hands of care providers (23% of samples). Samples were analyzed for total aerobic plate counts (APCs), total coliforms, biotype I Escherichia coli, and pathogens Shigella spp, Salmonella enterica, E coli O157, Campylobacter jejuni, and human norovirus.Results: Median APCs and coliform counts for hands were 4.6 and 1.0 log(10) colony-forming units (CFU) per hand, respectively. Median APCs for surfaces were 2.0 and 2.6 log(10) CFU for flat and irregular surfaces, respectively. Coliforms were detected in 16% of samples, with counts ranging from 1.0 log(10) to >4.3 log(10) CFU, with higher counts most often observed for hand rinse samples. Biotype I E coli counts were below assay detection limits (<1 log(10) CFU) for all but 1 sample. No samples were positive for any of the 4 bacterial pathogens, whereas 4 samples showed evidence of human norovirus RNA.Conclusion: The relative absence of pathogens and biotype I E coli in environmental samples suggests the child care facilities sampled in this study managed fecal contamination well.

J	Chanta, Sunarin; Mayorga, Maria E.; McLay, Laura A.								Improving emergency service in rural areas: a bi-objective covering location model for EMS systems								ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH				221	1			133	159		10.1007/s10479-011-0972-6			OCT 2014	2014	Emergency medical service (EMS) systems are public services that often provide the first line of response to urgent health care needs within a community. Unfortunately, it has been widely documented that large disparities in access to care exist between rural and urban communities. While rural EMS is provided through a variety of resources (e.g. air ambulances, volunteer corps, etc.), in this paper we focus on ground ambulatory care. In particular our goal is to balance the level of first-response ambulatory service provided to patients in urban and rural areas by locating ambulances at appropriate stations. In traditional covering location models the objective is to maximize demand that can be covered; consequently, these models favor locating ambulances in more densely populated areas, resulting in longer response times for patients in more rural areas. To address the issue of fairness in semi-rural/semi-urban communities, we propose three bi-objective covering location models that directly consider fairness via a secondary objective. Results are discussed and compared which provide a menu of alternatives to policy makers.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0254-5330	1572-9338		WOS:000342130200008		
J	Steck, Mary Beth								The Role of Melanocortin 1 Receptor in Cutaneous Malignant Melanoma: Along the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Pathway								BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH FOR NURSING				16	4			421	428		10.1177/1099800413519164			OCT 2014	2014	Cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) is an epidemic cancer in the United States. Survival rates for invasive CMM have not increased in past decades despite numerous clinical trials and the effective use of various combinations of chemotherapy agents to treat other cancers. Recent research has investigated the role of melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R), a gene associated with red-hair phenotype in White individuals and with increased risk for developing CMM, in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. This limited narrative review discusses the incidence, history, and risk factors for CMM. It explores familial CMM and provides a brief review of melanocyte development and melanogenesis. Histology of CMM and cytogenetic techniques used to identify CMM mutations is also discussed. The structure and function of MC1R is described, with particular attention to MC1R's role in the MAPK pathway. Finally, the review touches on individualized therapy for CMM using genetic biomarkers and explores the promise of genomic research for finding effective treatments.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1099-8004	1552-4175		WOS:000342390000007	24443365

Two 24-hr dietary recalls were used to measure intake of total calories, macronutrients, and 20 vitamins and minerals. Metabolic syndrome and its components were defined by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute criteria. Differences in statistical tests were noted when significant at P < 0.05.Results: Prevalence of metabolic syndrome among 20- to 59-year-old adults was 30.4% [95% confidence interval 27.6-33.2]. Among cohorts, metabolic syndrome was highest in black women and white men, and lowest in black men and white women. Regression analysis indicated that no macronutrients were associated with greater risk of metabolic syndrome. For relative macronutrient intake, men with metabolic syndrome consumed more polyunsaturated fats, whereas women with metabolic syndrome consumed more total, saturated and monounsaturated fats and less fiber and starch than women without metabolic syndrome. Among races, white men and women consumed greater absolute quantities of all macronutrients except carbohydrates and sugar. Micronutrient intake was greatest for white men and women; women without metabolic syndrome had greater micronutrient adequacy than women with metabolic syndrome.Conclusion: Nutrient intake varied between race/gender cohorts; however, there were few clinically significant differences in nutrient intake between those with and without metabolic syndrome. Diet may be marginally related to diagnosis of metabolic syndrome.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1540-4196	1557-8518		WOS:000342152500004	25045798

Suppression of Fusarium Wilt Caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp niveum Race 2 on Grafted Triploid Watermelon								PLANT DISEASE				98	10			1326	1332		10.1094/PDIS-01-14-0005-RE			OCT 2014	2014	Fusarium wilt of watermelon, caused by the soilborne fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum race 2, is a serious, widespread disease present in major watermelon-growing regions of the United States and other countries. 'Fascination,' a high yielding triploid resistant to race 1, is grown in southeastern states in fields that contain a mixture of races 1 and 2. There is some benefit to using cultivars with race 1 resistance in such fields, even though Fascination is susceptible to Fusarium wilt caused by race 2. Experiments in 2012 and 2013 were done in fields infested primarily with race 2 and a mixture of races 1 and 2, respectively. Fascination was grafted onto four rootstock cultivars: bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria) 'Macis' and 'Emphasis' and interspecific hybrid squash (Cucurbita maxima x C. moschata) 'Strong Tosa' and 'Carnivor.' Nongrafted and self-grafted Fascination were used as susceptible control treatments. In both experiments, mean incidence of plants with symptoms of Fusarium wilt was >= 52% in the susceptible control treatments and <= 6% on the grafted rootstocks. Disease incidence did not differ between rootstock species or cultivars. In both years, Fascination grafted onto Strong Tosa and Macis produced more marketable-sized fruit than the susceptible control treatments. Grafted Emphasis and Carnivor also produced more fruit than the control treatments in 2012. The cucurbit rootstocks suppressed Fusarium wilt caused by race 2 and increased marketable yield of triploid watermelon grown in infested soil.									2	1	0	2	0	3			0191-2917	1943-7692		WOS:000341799100005

In 1, 2, or 3 years, D. bozoniae reproduced on all 18 cultivars, on leaves, and on all plant parts examined pedicles, peduncles, petioles, tendrils, and vines. Watermelon and citron (both Citrullus lanatus) and melon (Cucumis melo) had significantly more leaves with fruiting bodies than cucumber (Cucumis sativus), bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria), and eight cultivars of squash and pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima, C. moschata, and C. pepo). On plant parts other than leaves, melon had the greatest proportions of tissue pieces with fruiting bodies, and citron had the least. Fruiting bodies were observed on 86% of plant parts examined in autumn 2009 but on only 28% in spring 2011, when environmental conditions were hot and dry. In 2009, pseudothecia and pycnidia were found in equal proportions on leaves, but pseudothecia were found more frequently than pycnidia on leaves in 2011 and on other plant parts in 2009 and 2011.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0191-2917	1943-7692		WOS:000341799100012

Bilevel multiobjective packaging optimization for automotive design								STRUCTURAL AND MULTIDISCIPLINARY OPTIMIZATION				50	4			663	682		10.1007/s00158-014-1120-0			OCT 2014	2014	The successful application of multiobjective optimization to engineering problems has motivated studies of more complex systems involving multiple subsystems and design disciplines, each with multiple design criteria. Complex system design requires participation of different teams that are highly specialized within each discipline and subsystem. Such a high differentiation results in limited sharing of information among the design teams. The mathematical modeling and the solution algorithm proposed in this paper address the issue of coordinating multiple design problems that negotiate according to conflicting criteria. The design of the layout of hybrid vehicles is formulated as a bilevel decomposed problem including a vehicle level and a battery level in concert with the specialization of the respective design teams required at each level. An iterative algorithm, the Multiobjective Decomposition Algorithm (MODA) is proposed, whose generated sequences are shown to converge to efficient designs for the overall design problem under certain conditions examined in the context of the block coordinate descent method and the method of multipliers. MODA applied to the hybrid electric design problem captures the bilevel tradeoffs originating by the conflicting objectives at the vehicle and battery levels.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1615-147X	1615-1488		WOS:000342208100010

This paper presents two optimization models for obtaining ecological reserve systems that are spatially compact. Compact reserve systems will increase species persistence relative to more fragmented systems and can reduce the costs associated with reserve boundaries. These optimization models employ a hierarchical approach that incorporates both the boundary length of all clusters and the sum of within-cluster distances. Unlike previous approaches, we argue that measuring the distance between sites within clusters (and not between clusters) is more appropriate. Numerical experiments are conducted on synthetic grid systems and on a real-world hexagonal data set. These experiments confirm that the models produce reasonably compact clusters of reserve sites that respect species availability and budget constraints. Simplifications to the models are developed that significantly reduce the computational effort, while still identifying reasonable sets of reserve clusters. Sensitivity of the results to changes in model parameters (number of allowable sites, number of possible clusters, and rarity of species covered) is also explored.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1420-2026	1573-2967		WOS:000341785100007

Here, we present a simple, scalable method to grow urchin-like AlOOH nanostructures on the surface of Al microspheres. Al nanoparticles with native oxide film were melted in molten salts, forming an immiscible materials system. During ultrasonic processing of the mixture, emulsion of micro Al droplets occurs and Al2O3 nanoparticles form from the native oxide films and self-assemble to form in-situ nanostructured templates on the surfaces of Al microspheres. When the solidified mixture of Al spheres and salt is exposed to water, urchin-like nanostructures spontaneously form on the Al microspheres due to a heterogeneous nucleation and growth of gamma-AlOOH on the Al2O3 templates. This work could be readily extended to other metals, providing a novel and scalable method for the fabrication of urchin-like metal oxide hydroxide nanostructures on metal microspheres.

A gradient field defeats the inherent repulsion between magnetic nanorods								ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE				1	2					UNSP 140271	10.1098/rsos.140271			OCT 2014	2014	When controlling the assembly of magnetic nanorods and chains of magnetic nanoparticles, it is extremely challenging to bring them together side by side while keeping a desired spacing between their axes. We show that this challenge can be successfully resolved by using a non-uniform magnetic field that defeats an inherent repulsion between nanorods. Nickel nanorods were suspended in a viscous film and a non-uniform field was used to control their placement. The in-plane movement of nanorods was tracked with a high-speed camera and a detailed image analysis was conducted to quantitatively characterize the behaviour of the nanorods. The analysis focused on the behaviour of a pair of neighbour nanorods, and a corresponding dynamic model was formulated and investigated. The complex two-dimensional dynamics of a nanorod pair was analysed analytically and numerically, and a phase portrait was constructed. Using this phase portrait, we classified the nanorod behaviour and revealed the experimental conditions in which nanorods could be placed side by side. Dependence of the distance between a pair of neighbour nanorods on physical parameters was analysed.

Distribution of Pseudacteon spp. (Diptera: Phoridae), biological control agents of Solenopsis spp. (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), in Louisiana and associated prevalence of Kneallhazia solenopsae (Microsporidia: Thelohaniidae)								BIOLOGICAL CONTROL				77				93	100		10.1016/j.biocontrol.2014.06.011			OCT 2014	2014	Phorid flies, Pseudacteon spp. (Diptera: Phoridae), have been released in the United States since 1996 as biological control agents for imported fire ants, Solenopsis invicta Buren, Solenopsis richteri Forel, and their hybrid (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). A statewide survey was conducted in Louisiana during 2009 and 2010 to determine the distribution of Pseudacteon tricuspis Borgmeier and Pseudacteon curvatus Borgmeier, and to quantify the potential spatial association between the two species. Additionally, collected phorid flies were tested for the microsporidium Kneallhazia (=Thelohania) solenopsae (Knell, Allen, and Hazard), another natural enemy of fire ants, to establish an account of the pathogen's distribution and prevalence in phorid fly populations. P. tricuspis and P. curvatus have expanded their range from four and three separate release sites, respectively, in Louisiana. By 2010, P. tricuspis and P. curvatus occupied approximately 86,600 and 111,900 km(2), respectively. Overall, P. curvatus was more abundant than P. tricuspis, with 41.9 +/- 7.3 (SE) and 9.8 +/- 1.5 (SE) females, respectively, collected on average per sampling site in 2009. Spatial Analysis by Distance IndicEs (SADIE) suggested aggregation for the two phorid fly species. P. tricuspis collections were positively associated with P. curvatus collections, indicating that gaps and clusters of both species generally overlapped. K. solenopsae was detected in 22 of 64 parishes, and among 124 collection sites tested, 19% yielded positive responses for K. solenopsae. P. tricuspis males and females and P. curvatus females were found to harbor K. solenopsae. This study is the first to detect K. solenopsae in P. tricuspis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

There are many opportunities for economies of scope and scale in the testing activities, but techniques that can take advantage of these opportunities are still needed.Objective: The objective of this study is to identify testing strategies that have the potential to achieve these economies, and to provide a synthesis of available research on SPL testing strategies, to be applied towards reaching higher defect detection rates and reduced quality assurance effort.Method: We performed a literature review of two hundred seventy-six studies published from the year 1998 up to the 1st semester of 2013. We used several filters to focus the review on the most relevant studies and we give detailed analyses of the core set of studies.Results: The analysis of the reported strategies comprised two fundamental aspects for software product line testing: the selection of products for testing, and the actual test of products. Our findings indicate that the literature offers a large number of techniques to cope with such aspects. However, there is a lack of reports on realistic industrial experiences, which limits the inferences that can be drawn.Conclusion: This study showed a number of leveraged strategies that can support both the selection of products, and the actual testing of products. Future research should also benefit from the problems and advantages identified in this study. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The observed differences of mean winds and tides are discussed in relation to the meteorological situation in the lower atmosphere and the possible generation of non-migrating tides. The longitudinally well separated radar sites allowed the evaluation of the migrating tidal component. The seasonal variation of signatures of the diurnal tide derived from ground-based radar observations, TIDI measurements aboard TIMED satellite, and model results obtained with HAMMONIA (Hamburg Model of the Neutral and Ionized Atmosphere) are compared. The ground-based, satellite, and model results of the total diurnal tide are in good agreement. The same is true for the migrating diurnal tide obtained from the radar observations, TIDI observations and from the model studies of HAMMONIA and GSVVM00 (Global Scale Wave Model).

Mater. Interfaces 6 (2014) 725-730). However, the stream from steam methane reforming contains high contents of H2O, CO2, and CO, which poses crueler challenges to the chemical stability of Ni-BZCYYb membrane than dry H-2 and CO2. In this work, we tested the Ni-BZCYYb membrane in wet H-2 and CO2 which generated high content of H2O and CO due to reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction at high temperature. High content of H2O improves the proton conductivity of BZCYYb and hydrogen transport through the membrane. On the other hand, H-2 content reduction and decomposition of BZCYYb promoted by high content of H2O lead to performance degradation. The steady-state hydrogen flux may increase or decrease depending on the balance among these effects. Besides, CO-induced Ni corrosion was found in both surface and bulk due to metal dusting. In general, Ni-BZCYYb membrane still displayed much better performance stability in wet H-2 and CO2 than Ni-BaCe0.8Y0.2O3-delta and Ni-BaZr0.1Ce0.7Y0.2O3-delta composites, making it a candidate material system for further studies aimed at membrane processing of hydrocarbons.

It was found that the electrical conductivity (sigma) increases almost by a factor of 6, through the optimization of SSR parameters. The enhancement in the electrical conductivity leads to an enhancement in the thermoelectric power factor by a factor of 3. In addition, the lattice thermal conductivity (k(L)) of the Sr1-xYbxTiO3-delta ceramics is suppressed with increasing Yb-doping, supposedly due to heavier atomic mass of Yb substituted at the Sr site and a smaller ionic radii of Yb+3 with respect to Sr+2 ions. However, our model calculations indicate that strain-field effect, which occurs due to the difference in ionic radii, is the more prominent phonon scattering mechanism in the Yb-doped SrTiO3. This work is an extension of our previous study on the underlying phonon scattering mechanisms in the Y-doped SrTiO3, which would provide new insight into thermal transport in doped SrTiO3 and could be used as a guideline for more effective material synthesis.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0022-3727	1361-6463		WOS:000341771100012

Based on morphological characteristics, Biolog identification, and 16S rDNA sequence analysis, we identified strain Q3 as Bacillus megaterium. We investigated the effects of temperature, pH, inoculation size, and initial quinclorac concentration on growth and degrading efficiency of Q3. Under the optimal degrading condition, Q3 could degrade 93% of quinclorac from the initial concentration of 20 mg/L in seven days. We analyzed the degradation products of quinclorac using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The major degradation products by Q3 were different from those of previously identified quinclorac degrading strains, which suggests that Q3 may employ new pathways for quinclorac degradation. Our indoor pot experiments demonstrated that Q3 can effectively alleviate the quinclorac phytotoxicity in tobacco. As the first endophytic microbial that is capable of degrading quinclorac, Q3 can be a good bioremediation bacterium for quinclorac phytotoxicity.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1932-6203			WOS:000343679800061	25244184

Our three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations consider plasma jet cores with Lorentz factors of 1.5, 5, and 15 for both electron-proton and electron-positron plasmas. For electron-proton plasmas, we find generation of strong large-scale DC currents and magnetic fields that extend over the entire shear surface and reach thicknesses of a few tens of electron skin depths. For electron-positron plasmas, we find generation of alternating currents and magnetic fields. Jet and sheath plasmas are accelerated across the shear surface in the strong magnetic fields generated by the kKHI. The mixing of jet and sheath plasmas generates a transverse structure similar to that produced by the Weibel instability.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000341301700060

Geophysical evaluation of solute plume spatial moments using an adaptive POD algorithm for electrical resistivity imaging								JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY				517				471	480		10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.05.054			SEP 19 2014	2014	We investigate the potential for characterizing spatial moments of subsurface solute plumes from surface-based electrical resistivity images produced within a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) inversion framework. The existing POD algorithm is improved here to allow for adaptive conditioning of the POD training images on resistivity measurements. The efficacy of the suggested technique is evaluated with two hypothetical transport scenarios: synthetic #1 is based on the case where the target plume and POD training images follow the same (unimodal) plume morphology, whereas a second source location in synthetic #2 makes the target plume bimodal and inconsistent with the POD training images. The resistivity imaging results indicate that the adaptive algorithm efficiently and robustly updates the POD training images to obtain good quality resistivity images of the target plumes, both in the presence of data noise and when conceptual model inaccuracies exist in the training simulations. Spatial moments of the solute plumes recovered from the resistivity images are also favorable, with relative mass recovery errors in the range of 0.6-4.4%, center of mass errors in the range of 0.6-9.6%, and spatial variance errors in the range of 3.4-45% for cases where the voltage data had 0-10% noise. These results are consistent with or improved upon those reported in the literature. Comparison of the resistivity-based moment estimates to those obtained from direct concentration sampling suggests that for cases with good quality resistivity data (i.e., <3% noise), the imaging results provide more accurate moments until 6-10 multilevel sampling wells are installed. While the specific number of wells will depend on the actual field scenario, we suggest that this finding illustrates the general value of POD-based resistivity imaging techniques for non-invasively estimating the spatial moments of a solute plume.

Despite the wide use, relatively little is understood about the efficiency of ligand exchange on the surface of iron oxide nanoparticles and how much of the hydrophobic ligand is removed. To address this issue, we utilized a radiotracer technique to track the exchange of a radiolabeled C-14-oleic acid ligand with hydrophilic ligands on the surface of magnetite nanoparticles. Iron oxide nanoparticles functionalized with C-14-oleic acid were modified with poly(ethylene glycol) with terminal functional groups including, L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, a nitrated L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine, carboxylic acid, a phosphonate, and an amine. Following ligand exchange, the nanoparticles and byproducts were analyzed using liquid scintillation counting and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. The labeled and unlabeled particles were further characterized by transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering to determine particle size, hydrodynamic diameter, and zeta potential. The unlabeled particles were characterized via thermogravimetric analysis and vibrating sample magnetometry. Radioanalytical determination of the C-14 from C-14-oleic acid was used to calculate the amount of oleic acid remaining on the surface of the particles after purification and ligand exchange. There was a significant loss of oleic acid on the surface of the particles after ligand exchange with amounts varying for the different functional binding groups on the poly(ethylene glycol). Nonetheless, all samples demonstrated some residual oleic acid associated with the particles. Quantification of the oleic acid remaining after ligand exchange reveals a binding hierarchy in which catechol derived anchor groups displace oleic acid on the surface of the nanoparticles better than the phosphonate, followed by the amine and carboxylic acid groups. Furthermore, the results show that these ligand exchange reactions do not necessarily occur to completion as is often assumed, thus leaving a residual amount of oleic acid on the surface of the particles. A thorough analysis of ligand exchange is required to develop nanoparticles that are suitable for their desired application.									14	1	0	0	0	15			0743-7463			WOS:000341800900015	25137089	
J	Li, Yangchun; Ginjupalli, Gautam K.; Baldwin, William S.								The HR97 (NR1L) group of nuclear receptors: A new group of nuclear receptors discovered in Daphnia species								GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY				206				30	42		10.1016/j.ygcen.2014.07.022			SEP 15 2014	2014	The recently sequenced Daphnia pulex genome revealed the NRI L nuclear receptor group consisting of three novel receptors. Phylogenetic studies show that this group is related to the NR1I group (CAR/PXR/VDR) and the NR1J group (HR96), and were subsequently named HR97a/b/g. Each of the HR97 paralogs from Daphnia magna, a commonly used crustacean in toxicity testing, was cloned, sequenced, and partially characterized. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the HR97 receptors are present in primitive arthropods such as the chelicerates but lost in insects. qPCR and immunohistochemistry demonstrate that each of the receptors is expressed near or at reproductive maturity, and that HR97g, the most ancient of the HR97 receptors, is primarily expressed in the gastrointestinal tract, mandibular region, and ovaries, consistent with a role in reproduction. Transactivation assays using an HR97a/b/g-GAL4 chimera indicate that unlike Daphnia HR96 that is promiscuous with respect to ligand recognition, the HR97 receptors do not respond to many of the ligands that activate CAR/PXR/HR96 nuclear receptors. Only three putative ligands of HR97 receptors were identified in this study: pyriproxyfen, methyl farnesoate, and arachidonic acid. Only arachidonic acid, which acts as an inverse agonist, alters HR97g activity at concentrations that would be considered within physiologically relevant ranges. Overall, this study demonstrates that, although closely related to the promiscuous receptors in the NR1I and NR1J groups, the HR97 receptors are mostly likely not multi-xenobiotic sensors, but rather may perform physiological functions, potentially in reproduction, unique to crustaceans and other non-insect arthropod groups.

The role of DOM is unclear because both photosensitizing and inhibitory effects of DOM on ROS have been observed. The present study investigated the effect of DOM on photochemical oxidation in Fe(III) contained water using Escherichia coli as a biological probe. Four different sizes and sources of DOM, including citrate, Pony Lake fulvic acid (PLFA), Suwannee River fulvic acid (SRFA), and Suwannee River humic acid (SRHA) were examined. Individual DOM, spiked with Fe(III) and H2O2 solutions, was inoculated with a known amount of E. coli and then was irradiated with simulated sunlight at pH 7 for 8 h. Experiments demonstrated that SRFA served as a strong photosensitizer, resulting a 5-log E. coli inactivation in the photo-irradiated Fe(III)-SRFA system. In contrast, SRHA served a strong inhibitor because no E. coli inactivation was observed in the Fe(III)-SRHA system. Both citrate and PLFA served as a weak inhibitor because their efficiencies of bacterial inactivation were slightly lower than the DOM-free system. In spite of their different inactivation efficiencies, H2O2 decomposition with comparable reaction rate constants were observed in all irradiated Fe(III)-DOM systems, suggesting H2O2 did not directly involve in the bacterial inactivation. Reactive chlorine species, generated from chloride with other reactive oxygen species, could be one of the reaction mechanisms causing bacterial inactivation because chloroform productions were observed in all treatments. Results demonstrated that DOM could either be a photosensitizer or an inhibitor in Fe(III) contained waters, probably depending on its carbonyl and carboxyl contents as well as molecular weight.

In the preparation of neat carbon materials based on graphene, a common approach has been the use of well-exfoliated graphene oxides (GOs) as the precursor, followed by conversion to reduced GOs (rGOs). However, rGOs are more suitable for the targeted high electrical conductivity achievable through percolation but considerably less effective in terms of efficient thermal transport dictated by phonon progression. In this work, neat carbon films were fabricated directly from few-layer graphene sheets, avoiding rGOs completely. These essentially graphenegraphene composites were of a metal-like appearance and mechanically flexible, exhibiting superior thermal and electrical transport properties. The observed thermal and electrical conductivities are higher than 220 W/m.K and 85000 S/m, respectively. Some issues in the further development of these mechanically flexible graphenegraphene nanocomposite materials are discussed and so are the associated opportunities.									14	0	0	2	0	14			1944-8244			WOS:000341544200035	25118974

ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION RESEARCH				20	5			581	611		10.1080/13504622.2013.838749			SEP 3 2014	2014	We conducted a systematic literature review of peer-reviewed research studies published between 1999 and 2010 that empirically evaluated the outcomes of environmental education (EE) programs for youth (ages 18 and younger) in an attempt to address the following objectives: (1) to seek reported empirical evidence for what works (or does not) in EE programming and (2) to uncover lessons regarding promising approaches for future EE initiatives and their evaluation. While the review generally supports consensus-based best practices, such as those published in the North American Association for Environmental Education's Guidelines for Excellence, we also identified additional themes that may drive positive outcomes, including the provision of holistic experiences and the characteristics and delivery styles of environmental educators. Overall, the evidence in support of these themes contained in the 66 articles reviewed is mostly circumstantial. Few studies attempted to empirically isolate the characteristics of programs responsible for measured outcomes. We discuss general trends in research design and the associated implications for future research and EE programming.									13	0	0	1	0	13			1350-4622	1469-5871		WOS:000342804400001

An evaluation of immersive viewing on spatial knowledge acquisition in spherical panoramic environments								VIRTUAL REALITY				18	3			189	201		10.1007/s10055-014-0245-1			SEP 2014	2014	We report the results of an experiment conducted to examine the effects of immersive viewing on a common spatial knowledge acquisition task of spatial updating task in a spherical panoramic environment (SPE). A spherical panoramic environment, such as Google Street View, is an environment that is comprised of spherical images captured at regular intervals in a real world setting augmented with virtual navigational aids such as paths, dynamic maps, and textual annotations. Participants navigated the National Mall area of Washington, DC, in Google Street View in one of two viewing conditions; desktop monitor or a head-mounted display with a head orientation tracker. In an exploration phase, participants were first asked to navigate and observe landmarks on a pre-specified path. Then, in a testing phase, participants were asked to travel the same path and to rotate their view in order to look in the direction of the perceived landmarks at certain waypoints. The angular difference between participants' gaze directions and the landmark directions was recorded. We found no significant difference between the immersive and desktop viewing conditions on participants' accuracy of direction to landmarks as well as no difference in their sense of presence scores. However, based on responses to a post-experiment questionnaire, participants in both conditions tended to use a cognitive or procedural technique to inform direction to landmarks. Taken together, these findings suggest that in both conditions where participants experience travel based on teleportation between waypoints, the visual cues available in the SPE, such as street signs, buildings and trees, seem to have a stronger influence in determining the directions to landmarks than the egocentric cues such as first-person perspective and natural head-coupled motion experienced in the immersive viewing condition.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-4338	1434-9957		WOS:000340621900003

DAILY SURVIVAL RATE FOR NESTS OF BLACK SKIMMERS FROM A CORE BREEDING AREA OF THE SOUTHEASTERN USA								WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY				126	3			443	450					SEP 2014	2014	Little is known about the reproductive success of Black Skimmers (Rynchops niger) throughout the southeastern USA where availability of undisturbed beaches for nesting is limited. Daily survival rates (DSR) of nests were examined at three nesting sites in Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge (CRNWR), South Carolina, USA, 2009-2010. The percent of successful nests (n = 346 nests) ranged from 42-69% among colony sites when data were pooled across both years. The DSR of nests was primarily related to colony site, predation risk, height of high tide, and clutch size. Predation and overwash were the principal causes of identifiable nest loss, each accounting for similar to 33% of nest failures during the two study years. Because of the challenges of resighting skimmer chicks, We were not able to measure chick survival effectively and therefore accurate measures of productivity remain elusive. High variability in nest success among sites Within close proximity to each other (<20 km) suggests factors at local scales such as disturbance, predation, and overwash events strongly influenced nest success of Black Skimmers during these 2 years as opposed to more region-wide stressors such as tropical storms or food availability. Although time-intensive techniques to control predators do exist, management options to limit flooding and overwash are far more limited. Conservation of Black Skimmers in the southeastern USA would benefit from coordinated, multi-state efforts to measure nest and chick survival.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1559-4491	1938-5447		WOS:000342962600003

Comparison of Burning and Weed Barriers for Restoring Common Tern (Sterna hirundo) Nesting Habitat in the Gulf of Maine								WATERBIRDS				37	3			286	297					SEP 2014	2014	As seabird nesting colonies have become concentrated on fewer managed islands, available nesting habitat for open-ground nesters such as Common Terns (Sterna hirundo) has rapidly become overgrown by guano-fertilized vegetation, leading managers to try various methods of vegetation control to open usable nesting habitat. Two of these methods, burning and synthetic weed barrier treatments, were tested in the summers of 2009 and 2010 to assess their ability to open and maintain Common Tern nesting habitat on two nearshore seabird nesting islands in Maine. Treatments were applied to overgrown habitat pre-nesting, and vegetation regrowth and Common Tern nest and fledging success were monitored in treated plots, untreated vegetation plots and occupied Common Tern nesting habitat. Burned areas did not remain open for the full nesting season, but regrew shortly after egg-laying, creating unsuitable vegetation structure and leading to near-complete nest failure in these plots. However, vegetation characteristics produced by the two different weed barrier treatments one a layer of muslin fabric overlaying newspaper mulch and the other a mosaic of synthetic turf and open ground were similar to vegetation in pre-existing Common Tern nesting habitat throughout the season. Common Tern nest and fledging success was similar in weed barrier plots (1.37 chicks/pair) and pre-existing Common Tern nesting habitat (1.38 chicks/pair). While burning may not be a useful technique for creating nesting habitat, synthetic weed barriers offer a promising short-term solution to vegetation overgrowth in nesting habitat of Common Terns and species with similar habitat requirements.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1524-4695	1938-5390		WOS:000342476000006		
J	Wash, Kirsti								EDGELESS GRAPHS ARE THE ONLY UNIVERSAL FIXERS								CZECHOSLOVAK MATHEMATICAL JOURNAL				64	3			833	843					SEP 2014	2014	Given two disjoint copies of a graph G, denoted G(1) and G(2), and a permutation pi of V(G), the graph pi G is constructed by joining u is an element of V(G(1)) to pi(u) is an element of V(G(2)) for all u is an element of V(G(1)). G is said to be a universal fixer if the domination number of pi G is equal to the domination number of G for all pi of V(G). In 1999 it was conjectured that the only universal fixers are the edgeless graphs. Since then, a few partial results have been shown. In this paper, we prove the conjecture completely.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0011-4642	1572-9141		WOS:000349026300017

(2014) generated a list of 74 needs for use in developing an actively assistive over-the-bed table. This present study assesses the value and importance of those needs.METHODS: Fourteen healthcare subject matter experts and eight research and design subject matter experts engaged in a participatory and iterative research and design process. A mixed methods qualitative approach used methodological triangulation to confirm the value of the findings and ratings to establish importance. Open and closed card sorts and a Delphi study were used. Data analysis methods included frequency analysis, content analysis, and a modified Kano analysis.RESULTS: A table demonstrating the needs that are of high importance to both groups of subject matter experts and classification of the design challenges each represents was produced. Through this process, the list of 74 needs was refined to the 37 most important need statements for both groups.CONCLUSIONS: Designing a more useful, usable, and actively assistive over-the-bed table is primarily about the ability to position it optimally with respect to the user for any task, as well as improving ease of use and usability. It is also important to make explicit and discuss the differences in priorities and perspectives demonstrated between research and design teams and their clients.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1937-5867	2167-5112		WOS:000346926200007	25816185

Main effects analyses of a sample of 28 experimental and quasi-experimental studies reveal that peer-mediation is more effective for ELLs than individualized or teacher-centered comparison conditions (g=.486, SE=.121, p<.001). A number of potential moderators were examined, and two study quality variables proved significant. Also, grade level was a significant moderator, with middle school students demonstrating much smaller gains than elementary or high school students. Finally, descriptive analysis of moderators provides tentative evidence that ELLs showed greater gains on word-level outcomes than text-level outcomes and that interventions for which peer-mediation was one of several tightly-woven components were twice as effective as interventions utilizing peer-mediation alone.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1086-296X	1554-8430		WOS:000346170900004

Elevated CO2 could partly mitigate warming induced moisture stress, and the degree of this mitigation may vary with plant functional types. We studied the composition of structural and non-structural metabolites in senesced tissues of Bouteloua gracilis (C-4) and Pascopyrum smithii (C3) at the Prairie Heating and CO2 Enrichment experiment, Wyoming, USA. We hypothesized that P. smithii and B. gracilis would respond to unfavorable global change factors by producing structural metabolites and osmoregulatory compounds that are necessary to combat stress. However, due to the inherent variation in the tolerance of their photosynthetic pathways to warming and CO2, we hypothesized that these species will exhibit differential response under different combinations of warming and CO2 conditions. Due to a lower thermo-tolerance of the C4 photosynthesis we expected B. gracilis to exhibit a greater metabolic response under warming with ambient CO2 (cT) and P. smithii to exhibit a similar response under warming combined with elevated CO2 (CT). Our hypothesis was supported by the differential response of structural compounds in these two species, where cT increased the content of lignin and cuticular-matrix in B. gracilis. In P. smithii a similar response was observed in plants exposed to CT, possibly due to the partial alleviation of moisture stress. With warming, the total cell-wall bound phenolic acids that cross link polysaccharides to lignins increased in B. gracilis and decreased in P. smithii, indicating a potentially adaptive response of C4 pathway to warming alone. Similarly, in B. gracilis, extractable polar metabolites such as sugars and phenolic acids increased with the main effect of warming. Conversely, in P. smithii, only sugars showed a higher abundance in plants exposed to warming treatments indicating that warming alone might be metabolically too disruptive for the C3 photosynthetic pathway. Here we show for the first time, that along with traditionally probed extractable metabolites, warming and elevated CO2 differentially influence the structural metabolites in litters of photosynthetically divergent grass species. If these unique metabolite responses occur in other species of similar functional types, this could potentially alter carbon cycling in grasslands due to the varying degradability of these litters.									2	0	0	2	0	2			2150-8925			WOS:000345097000003

Protic Cationic Oligomeric Ionic Liquids of the Urethane Type								POLYMER SCIENCE SERIES B				56	5			583	592		10.1134/S156009041405011X			SEP 2014	2014	Protic oligomeric cationic ionic liquids of the oligo(ether urethane) type are synthesized via the reaction of an isocyanate prepolymer based on oligo(oxy ethylene)glycol with M = 1000 with hexamethylene-diisocyanate followed by blocking of the terminal isocyanate groups with the use of amine derivatives of imidazole, pyridine, and 3-methylpyridine and neutralization of heterocycles with ethanesulfonic acid and p-toluenesulfonic acid. The structures and properties of the synthesized oligomeric ionic liquids substantially depend on the structures of the ionic groups. They are amorphous at room temperature, but ethanesulfonate imidazolium and pyridinium oligomeric ionic liquids form a low melting crystalline phase. The proton conductivities of the oligomeric ionic liquids are determined by the type of cation in the temperature range 80-120 degrees C under anhydrous conditions and vary within five orders of magnitude. The resulting compounds are thermally stable up to 200-270 degrees C.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1560-0904	1555-6123		WOS:000343910600005

Circulating Fat-Soluble Vitamin Concentrations and Nutrient Composition of Aquatic Prey Eaten by American Oystercatchers (Haematopus palliatus palliatus) in the Southeastern United States								JOURNAL OF AVIAN MEDICINE AND SURGERY				28	3			216	224					SEP 2014	2014	The American oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus palliatus) is currently listed as a species of high concern by the United States Shorebird Conservation Plan. Because nutritional status directly impacts overall health and reproduction of individuals and populations, adequate management of a wildlife population requires intimate knowledge of a species' diet and nutrient requirements. Fat-soluble vitamin concentrations in blood plasma obtained from American oystercatchers and proximate, vitamin, and mineral composition of various oystercatcher prey species were determined as baseline data to assess nutritional status and nutrient supply. Bird and prey species samples were collected from the Cape Romain region, South Carolina, USA, and the Altamaha River delta islands, Georgia, USA, where breeding populations appear relatively stable in recent years. Vitamin A levels in blood samples were higher than ranges reported as normal for domestic avian species, and vitamin D concentrations were lower than anticipated based on values observed in poultry. Vitamin E levels were within ranges previously reported for avian groups with broadly similar feeding niches such as herons, gulls, and terns (eg, aquatic/estuarine/marine). Prey species (oysters, mussels, clams, blood arks [Anadara omits], whelks [Busycon carica], false angel wings [Petricola pholadiformis]) were similar in water content to vertebrate prey, moderate to high in protein, and moderate to low in crude fat. Ash and macronutrient concentrations in prey species were high compared with requirements of carnivores or avian species. Prey items analyzed appear to meet nutritional requirements for oystercatchers, as estimated by extrapolation from domestic carnivores and poultry species; excesses, imbalances, and toxicities particularly of minerals and fat-soluble vitamins may warrant further investigation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1082-6742	1938-2871		WOS:000343619100004	25843321	
J	Haviland, Sarah; Cleemann, Lars; Kettlewell, Sarah; Smith, Godfrey L.; Morad, Martin								Diversity of mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes: Evidence from a genetically directed Ca2+ probe, mitycam-E31Q								CELL CALCIUM				56	3			133	146		10.1016/j.ceca.2014.06.001			SEP 2014	2014	I-Ca-gated Ca2+ release (CICR) from the cardiac SR is the main mechanism mediating the rise of cytosolic Ca2+, but the extent to which mitochondria contribute to the overall Ca2+ signaling remains controversial. To examine the possible role of mitochondria in Ca2+ signaling, we developed a low affinity mitochondrial Ca2+ probe, mitycam-E31Q (300-500 MOI, 48-72 h) and used it in conjunction with Fura-2AM to obtain simultaneous TIRF images of mitochondrial and cytosolic Ca2+ in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Mitycam-E31Q staining of adult feline cardiomyocytes showed the typical mitochondrial longitudinal fluorescent bandings similar to that of TMRE staining, while neonatal rat cardiomyocytes had a disorganized tubular or punctuate appearance. Caffeine puffs produced rapid increases in cytosolic Ca2+ while simultaneously measured global mitycam-E31Q signals decreased more slowly (increased mitochondrial Ca2+) before decaying to baseline levels. Similar, but oscillating mitycam-E31Q signals were seen in spontaneously pacing cells. Withdrawal of Na+ increased global cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ signals in one population of mitochondria, but unexpectedly decreased it (release of Ca2+) in another mitochondrial population. Such mitochondrial Ca2+ release signals were seen not only during long lasting Na+ withdrawal, but also when Ca2+ loaded cells were exposed to caffeine-puffs, and during spontaneous rhythmic beating. Thus, mitochondrial Ca2+ transients appear to activate with a delay following the cytosolic rise of Ca2+ and show diversity in subpopulations of mitochondria that could contribute to the plasticity of mitochondrial Ca2+ signaling.

Here, a number of improvements to traditional photolithography are introduced to increase the versatility of the process. The shrinkage of SU-8 during carbonization is then detailed as one of the guidelines necessary to design carbon patterns. A couple of applications-(1) carbon-electrode dielectrophoresis for bioparticle manipulation; and (2) the use of carbon structures as micro-molds are also presented.									4	0	0	0	0	4			2072-666X			WOS:000343094500027

Here we present a design for an inexpensive tabletop instrument to measure shear modulus (G) and other longitudinal shear properties of a micrometer-sized monofilament fiber sample, such as nonlinearities and hysteresis. This automated system applies twist to the sample and measures the resulting torque using a sensitive optical detector that tracks a torsion reference. The accuracy of the instrument was verified by measuring G for high purity copper and tungsten fibers, for which G is well known. Two industrially important fibers, IM7 carbon fiber and Kevlar (R) 119, were also characterized with this system and were found to have G = 16.5 +/- 2.1 and 2.42 +/- 0.32 GPa, respectively.

J	Kontgis, Caitlin; Schneider, Annemarie; Fox, Jefferson; Saksena, Sumeet; Spencer, James H.; Castrence, Miguel								Monitoring peri-urbanization in the greater Ho Chi Minh City metropolitan area								APPLIED GEOGRAPHY				53				377	388		10.1016/j.apgeog.2014.06.029			SEP 2014	2014	Across the globe, urban areas are rapidly expanding, and now the majority of the world's population lives in cities. Pen-urbanization, a specific form of urbanization characterized by rapid and fragmented growth, is also increasing, especially in developing countries. By 2030, it is anticipated that pen-urban areas in East Asia will expand by 200 million people, or 40% of total projected urban population growth, creating in these areas one of the largest and most significant land cover changes in the region. Characterizing and understanding the pen-urbanization process is critical, as these transition zones have a wide range of impacts across multiple scales, including local effects on farmer livelihoods, regional impacts to economic development, fragmented governance, as well as detrimental environmental impacts such as increased air and groundwater pollution, loss of native vegetation, and decreases in biodiversity. Yet the dynamic and piecemeal nature of pen-urbanization presents challenges for monitoring this unique process. This research combines commune-level Vietnamese census information, dense time stacks of Landsat satellite data (1990-2012), and several spatial measures to quantify urbanization and pen-urbanization in the greater Ho Chi Minh City metropolitan area from 1990 to 2012. The results indicate that 660.2 km(2) of cropland was converted to urban uses (a near quintupling of urban land), while 3.5 million persons moved into the region, bringing the total population to nearly 12 million by 2012. The analysis also highlights the rapid, unplanned nature of pen-urban development: approximately one-third of new urban expansion occurs in areas >40 km from the core, with nearly 50% of population expansion occurring in communes classified as pen-urban. This pattern of growth is likely linked to policies meant to spur foreign investment, and we expect that these regions will continue to attract much, if not most, of the foreign direct investment (FDI) flowing to the region, since most large manufacturing enterprises now locate in pen-urban areas.

Donor-Acceptor 1,4-Fluorenylene Chromophores: Photophysics, Electrochemistry, and Synthesis through a Route for Asymmetric Chromophore Preparation								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY					27			5998	6009		10.1002/ejoc.201402181			SEP 2014	2014	Fourteen chromophores of the form 1-(4-X-styryl)-4-(4-nitrostyryl)benzene or 1-(4-X-styryl)-4-(4-nitrostyryl)fluorene have been synthesized with X = CF3, Cl, I, H, CH3, OCH3, or OCH(CH3)(3). An innovative synthetic route was developed in the course of this work wherein phosphonium-phosphonate ester bifunctional precursors were employed. By exploiting steric considerations and the difference in acidity of protons in the position alpha to the phosphonium and phosphonate ester, target asymmetric chromophores were assembled in a straightforward fashion with high selectivity. The photophysical characteristics of the chromophores are described, including notable solvatochromism revealed by measuring photophysical properties in acetonitrile, dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, and toluene. Electrochemical analysis by cyclic voltammetry, along with DFT calculations (B3LYP-6-31G*) were employed to reveal the HOMO and LUMO distributions and energies, thus providing further understanding of the properties of these materials and the similarities/differences between phenylene-centered and fluorenylene-centered chromophores.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1434-193X	1099-0690		WOS:000342689400018

Challenges to a state's territorial integrity lead governments to increase their military personnel, and the resources that support these increases most often come willingly from a public that seeks security. Territorial threats are unlike other types of threats because they challenge individual lives and livelihoods, which both connects the average citizen with the state and allows for easier government extraction of necessary resources. Thus, external territorial threats increase state capacity by unifying the state and by increasing the repressive power of the central government. We identify territorial threats as both latent and realized claims against state territories and find that the presence of an external threat to territory leads to an increase in the capacity of central governments to connect and extract from its citizens, as well as the capacity to repress potential regime dissidents. We also find that the presence of a claim against a state's territory from a neighbor corresponds with a substantial decrease in the likelihood of intrastate conflict at both high and low levels of intensity. The effect of territorial threat is observed even in the short term after a territorial threat has been resolved.

For comparison, ions were loaded during hydrogel formulation or loaded by partitioning following construct synthesis. Using the Koshmeyer-Peppas release model, the apparent diffusion coefficient, D-app, and diffusional exponents, n, were D-app (pre-K+) = 2.03 x 10(-5), n = 0.4 and D-app (post-K+) = 1.86 x 10(-5), n = 0.33 respectively, indicative of Fickian transport. The D-app (pre-Ca2+) = 3.90 x 10(-6), n = 0.60 and D-app (post-Ca2+) = 2.85 x 10(-6), n = 0.85, respectively, indicative of case II and anomalous transport. Results indicate that divalent cations form cation-polyelectrolyte anion polymer complexes while monovalent ions do not. Temperature dependence of potassium ion release was shown to follow an Arrhenius-type relation with negative apparent activation energy of -19 +/- 15 while calcium ion release was temperature independent over the physiologically relevant range (25-45 degrees C) studied. The negative apparent activation energy may be due to temperature dependent polymer swelling. No effect of polymer swelling on the diffusional exponent or rate constant was found suggesting polymer relaxation occurs independent of polymer swelling.									3	0	0	0	0	3			2073-4360			WOS:000342904000010

Semiparametric group testing regression models								BIOMETRIKA				101	3			587	598		10.1093/biomet/asu007			SEP 2014	2014	Group testing, through the use of pooling, has proven to be an efficient method of reducing the time and cost associated with screening for a binary characteristic of interest, such as infection status. A topic of key interest in the statistical literature involves the development of regression models that relate individual-level covariates to testing responses observed from pooled specimens. In this article, we propose a general semiparametric framework that allows for the inclusion of multi-dimensional covariates, decoding information, and imperfect testing. The asymptotic properties of our estimators are presented and guidance on finite sample implementation is provided. We illustrate the performance of our methods through simulation and by applying them to chlamydia and gonorrhea data collected by the Nebraska Public Health Laboratory as a part of the Infertility Prevention Project.									3	0	0	1	0	3			0006-3444	1464-3510		WOS:000341465300006

If so, what does it mean to be a megatrend, and how can macromarketing advance our understanding of sustainability as a megatrend? This article makes three contributions to research on sustainability as megatrend. First, if offers a set of elemental criteria to understand the concept of a megatrend. Megatrends are complex in nature, whose understanding requires the skills and perspectives of macromarketers. Second, this article articulates two schools of thought in Macromarketing scholarship, a Developmental School and a Critical School. The former operates from the premise that marketing systems are important parts of the solution to the human condition, while the latter operates from the premise that they are part of the problem. Each concludes that sustainability is the megatrend of our time, but for different reasons. Finally, this article offers directions for macromarketing scholars, who are uniquely positioned to explore sustainability as megatrend.									11	0	0	1	0	11			0276-1467	1552-6534		WOS:000342569100002

Investigating the Portrayal and Influence of Sustainability Claims in an Environmental Advertising Context								JOURNAL OF MACROMARKETING				34	3	SI		332	348		10.1177/0276146713518944			SEP 2014	2014	The ability of consumer judges to identify sustainable messages in environmental advertising and the effect of these messages is explored. A content analysis provides insight into these judges' perceptions of the depth of environmental advertising messages. An experiment investigates the influence of sustainable messages and includes collection of cognitive response data to evaluate the cognitive dimension of sustainability messages. Content analysis results suggest that sustainability messages may influence how environmental advertisements are perceived. These findings are supported by the cognitive response data, which shows cognitive differences across advertisements, and the experimental manipulation that suggests sustainable ads may be more involving to consumers.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0276-1467	1552-6534		WOS:000342569100007

Quantum-mechanical investigations of incorporation seek to characterize the stability and geometry of incorporated structures, as well as the thermodynamics and kinetics of the reactions themselves. For a thermodynamic treatment of incorporation reactions, a source of the incorporated ion and a sink for the released ion is necessary. These sources/sinks in a real geochemical system can be solids, but more commonly, they are charged aqueous species. In this contribution, we review the current methods for ab initio calculations of incorporation reactions, many of which do not consider incorporation from aqueous species. We detail a recently-developed approach for the calculation of incorporation reactions and expand on the part that is modeling the interaction of periodic solids with aqueous source and sink phases and present new research using this approach. To model these interactions, a systematic series of calculations must be done to transform periodic solid source and sink phases to aqueous-phase clusters. Examples of this process are provided for three case studies: (1) neptunyl incorporation into studtite and boltwoodite: for the layered boltwoodite, the incorporation energies are smaller (more favorable) for reactions using environmentally relevant source and sink phases (i.e., Delta E-rxn(oxides) > Delta E-rxn(silicates) > Delta E-rxn(aqueous)). Estimates of the solid-solution behavior of Np5+/P5+- and U6+/Si4+-boltwoodite and Np5+/Ca2+- and U6+/K+-boltwoodite solid solutions are used to predict the limit of Np-incorporation into boltwoodite (172 and 768 ppm at 300 degrees C, respectively); (2) uranyl and neptunyl incorporation into carbonates and sulfates: for both carbonates and sulfates, it was found that actinyl incorporation into a defect site is more favorable than incorporation into defect-free periodic structures. In addition, actinyl incorporation into carbonates with aragonite structure is more favorable than into carbonates with calcite structure; and (3) uranium incorporation into magnetite: within the configurations tested that preserve charge neutrality (U6+ -> 2Fe(oct/tet)(3+) or U4+ -> Fe-oct(2+)), uranium incorporation into magnetite is most favorable when U6+ replaces octahedral Fe3+ with charge balancing accomplished by an octahedral Fe3+ iron vacancy. At the end of this article, the limitations of this method and important sources of error inherent in these calculations (e. g., hydration energies) are discussed. Overall, this method and examples may serve as a guide for future studies of incorporation in a variety of contexts.									6	0	0	2	0	6			2075-163X			WOS:000342622000007

Pseudocodewords of Parity-Check Codes Over Fields of Prime Cardinality								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY				60	9			5215	5227		10.1109/TIT.2014.2331677			SEP 2014	2014	This paper considers pseudocodewords of low-density parity-check codes over alphabets with prime cardinality p for use over the p-ary symmetric channel. Pseudocodewords are decoding algorithm outputs that may not be legitimate codewords. Here, we consider pseudocodewords arising from graph cover decoding and linear programming decoding. For codes over the binary alphabet, such pseudocodewords correspond to rational points of the fundamental polytope. They can be characterized via the fundamental cone, which is the conic hull of the fundamental polytope; the pseudocodewords are precisely those integer vectors within the fundamental cone that reduce modulo 2 to a codeword. In this paper, we determine a set of conditions that pseudocodewords of codes over F-p, the finite field of prime cardinality p, must satisfy. To do so, we introduce a class of critical multisets and a mapping, which associates a real number to each pseudocodeword over F-p. The real numbers associated with pseudocodewords are subject to lower bounds imposed by the critical multisets. The inequalities are given in terms of the parity-check matrix entries and critical multisets. This gives a necessary and sufficient condition for pseudocodewords of codes over F-2 and F-3 and a necessary condition for those over larger alphabets. In addition, irreducible pseudocodewords of codes over F-3 are found as a Hilbert basis for the lifted fundamental cone.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0018-9448	1557-9654		WOS:000342415600010		
J	Shen, Haiying; Liu, Guoxin; Gemmill, Jill; Ward, Lee								A P2P-Based Infrastructure for Adaptive Trustworthy and Efficient Communication in Wide-Area Distributed Systems								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS				25	9			2222	2233		10.1109/TPDS.2013.159			SEP 2014	2014	Tremendous advances in pervasive networking have enabled wide-area distributed systems to connect distributed resources or users such as corporate data centers and high-performance computing centers. These distributed pervasive systems take advantage of resources and enhance collaborations worldwide. However, due to lack of central management, they are severely threatened by a variety of malicious users in today's Internet. Current reputation-and anonymity-based technologies for node communication enhance system trustworthiness. However, most of these technologies gain trustworthiness at the cost of efficiency degradation. This paper presents a P2P-based infrastructure for trustworthy and efficient node communication in wide-area distributed systems. It jointly addresses trustworthiness and efficiency in its operation in order to meet the high-performance requirements of a diversified wealth of distributed pervasive applications. The infrastructure includes two policies: trust/efficiency-oriented request routing and trust-based adaptive anonymous response forwarding. This infrastructure not only offers a trustworthy environment with anonymous communication but also enhances overall system efficiency through harmonious trustworthiness and efficiency trade-offs. Experimental results from simulations and the real-world PlanetLab testbed show the superior performance of the P2P-based infrastructure in achieving both high trustworthiness and high efficiency in comparison to other related approaches.									1	1	0	0	0	2			1045-9219	1558-2183		WOS:000342179000002

However, its sustainable development is severely hindered by the intrinsic limit of the client/server architecture deployed in current OSN video systems, which is not only costly in terms of server bandwidth and storage but also not scalable with the soaring amount of users and video content. The peer-assisted Video-on-Demand (VoD) technique, in which participating peers assist the server in delivering video content, has been proposed recently. Unfortunately, videos can only be disseminated through friends in OSNs. Therefore, current VoD works that explore clustering nodes with similar interests or close location for high performance are suboptimal, if not entirely inapplicable, in OSNs. Based on our long-term real-world measurement of over 1,000,000 users and 2,500 videos on Facebook, we propose SocialTube, a novel peer-assisted video sharing system that explores social relationship, interest similarity, and physical location between peers in OSNs. Specifically, SocialTube incorporates four algorithms: a social network (SN)-based P2P overlay construction algorithm, an SN-based chunk prefetching algorithm, chunk delivery, and scheduling algorithm, and a buffer management algorithm. Experimental results from a prototype on PlanetLab and an event-driven simulator show that SocialTube can improve the quality of user experience and system scalability over current P2P VoD techniques.									10	0	0	0	0	10			1045-9219	1558-2183		WOS:000342179000021

One particular area of RD research that has not received considerable attention is in working with multiple time series responses, observed frequently within the field of pharmaceutical science. In order to determine the optimal pharmaceutical formulation, or input factor settings, suitable robust experimental design and analysis methods must be performed. To achieve this objective, the primary aim of this paper is to propose a new methodology that specifically addresses the multi-response time series problem for a pharmaceutical formulation process. First, an experimental format and framework for testing drug release kinetics is proposed by implementing a mixture experimental design and time series response modeling. Second, an alternative robust design model is developed to identify the optimal pharmaceutical formulation, based upon the time series target profiles for drug release kinetics. Finally, a case study associated with a drug development process is performed to validate the proposed model. The results of this case study indicate that the optimal drug release kinetics is significantly similar to the target profile.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0268-3768	1433-3015		WOS:000342486300040

Male and Female He Created Them: Gender Traditionalism, Masculine Images of God, and Attitudes Toward Same-Sex Unions								JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION				53	3			479	496		10.1111/jssr.12130			SEP 2014	2014	Prior research demonstrates that religion and gender traditionalism are associated with less favorable attitudes toward same-sex unions because of its deviation from customary religious doctrine and traditional patterns of gender behavior. This study examines the link between religion, gender traditionalism, and attitudes toward same-sex unions by utilizing a novel measure of gender traditionalism that is distinctly religious as well. Recent work on images of God reveals that individuals' views of the divine provide a glimpse of their underlying view of reality. The results suggest that individuals who view God as a he are much less favorable toward same-sex unions than those who do not view God as masculine, even while controlling for gender traditionalist beliefs and other images of God. Individuals who view God as masculine are signaling a belief in an underlying gendered reality that influences their perceptions of the proper ordering of that reality, which extends to marriage patterns. These findings encourage future research to identify innovative measures of religion that incorporate aspects of other social institutions to account for their interconnected nature.									4	0	0	1	0	4			0021-8294	1468-5906		WOS:000341872000003

Many previous studies with real objects have investigated the mechanical properties that underlie human haptic perception. Few virtual environments, however, have systematically incorporated the relevant mechanical parameters underlying kinesthetic perception. In this study, the ability of a haptic device to render kinesthetic information regarding the inertial properties of virtual objects was tested. Results suggest that users were able to perceive length of rendered virtual objects via the haptic device. Further, users can be trained using the haptic device to increase sensitivity to specific mechanical parameters (like inertia) that are perceptually salient in perceiving properties of rendered objects. The primary implication of this finding is that rendering kinesthetic parameters and employing feedback in a systematic manner may increase the realism of virtual environments and also improve haptic perception.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1783-7677	1783-8738		WOS:000342069200007

As analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, a rectangular-semicircular micro-patterned die successfully produced extruded cast-films with hill-like micro-texture. Such films displayed static and kinetic coefficients of friction (COFs and COFk) values of 0.247 +/- 0.028 and 0.245 +/- 0.003, respectively, for a steel fixture sliding along the micro-texture of the film. The equivalent COFs and COFk values for non-textured (NT) films were 0.369 +/- 0.036 and 0.340 +/- 0.024, respectively, confirming that textured films displayed a reduction in COF of about 30%. For textured and NT films sliding on textured films, the COFk values were even lower at 0.161 +/- 0.013 and 0.113 +/- 0.004, which represents about 20-40% reduction as compared with that for the NT-NT counterparts. Films coated with a silicone lubricant displayed COFs and COFk values of 0.334 +/- 0.042 and 0.099 +/- 0.012, respectively, for NT films sliding over lubricated NT films, and 0.426 +/- 0.031 and 0.063 +/- 0.006, respectively, for textured films sliding over lubricated textured films. The COFk values for textured/non-lubricated films approach those of NT/lubricated films, indicating that micro-textured polypropylene films may be used in environmentally sensitive applications where lubricants and fluorinated additives may not be used for reducing friction.

Lanthana is an interesting species to investigate since it possesses a wide transparency window covering the common fiber laser and telecom system wavelengths. As might be expected, it is found that the properties of lanthana are very similar to those of ytterbia (Yb2O3), namely, low acoustic velocity, wide Brillouin spectral width, and a negative photoelastic constant, with the latter two properties affording significant reductions to the Brillouin gain coefficient. However, lanthana possesses thermo-acoustic and strain-acoustic coefficients (acoustic velocity versus temperature or strain, TAC and SAC, respectively) with signs that are opposed to those of ytterbia. The lanthano-aluminosilicate (SAL) fiber utilized in this study is Brillouin-athermal (no dependence of the Brillouin frequency on temperature), but not atensic (is dependent upon the strain), which is believed to be, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstration of such a glass fiber utilizing a compositional engineering approach.

Microfluidics-based laser cell-micropatterning system								BIOFABRICATION				6	3					035025	10.1088/1758-5082/6/3/035025			SEP 2014	2014	The ability to place individual cells into an engineered microenvironment in a cell-culture model is critical for the study of in vivo relevant cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. Microfluidics provides a high-throughput modality to inject various cell types into a microenvironment. Laser guided systems provide the high spatial and temporal resolution necessary for single-cell micropatterning. Combining these two techniques, the authors designed, constructed, tested and evaluated (1) a novel removable microfluidics-based cell-delivery biochip and (2) a combined system that uses the novel biochip coupled with a laser guided cell-micropatterning system to place individual cells into both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) arrays. Cell-suspensions of chick forebrain neurons and glial cells were loaded into their respective inlet reservoirs and traversed the microfluidic channels until reaching the outlet ports. Individual cells were trapped and guided from the outlet of a microfluidic channel to a target site on the cell-culture substrate. At the target site, 2D and 3D pattern arrays were constructed with micron-level accuracy. Single-cell manipulation was accomplished at a rate of 150 mu m s(-1) in the radial plane and 50 m s-1 in the axial direction of the laser beam. Results demonstrated that a single-cell can typically be patterned in 20-30 s, and that highly accurate and reproducible cellular arrays and systems can be achieved through coupling the microfluidics-based cell-delivery biochip with the laser guided system.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1758-5082	1758-5090		WOS:000341823500025	25190714

Alginate gelation-induced cell death during laser-assisted cell printing								BIOFABRICATION				6	3					035022	10.1088/1758-5082/6/3/035022			SEP 2014	2014	Modified laser-induced forward transfer has emerged as a promising bioprinting technique. Depending on the operating conditions and cell properties, laser cell printing may cause cell injury and even death, which should be carefully elucidated for it to be a viable technology. This study has investigated the effects of alginate gelation, gelation time, alginate concentration, and laser fluence on the post-transfer cell viability of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Sodium alginate and calcium chloride are used as the gel precursor and gel reactant solution to form cell-laden alginate microspheres. It is found that the effects of gelation depend on the duration of gelation. Two-minute gelation is observed to increase the cell viability after 24 h incubation, mainly due to the protective cushion effect of the forming gel membrane during droplet landing. Despite the cushion effect from 10 min gelation, it is observed that the cell viability decreases after 24 h incubation because of the forming thick gel membrane that reduces nutrient and oxygen diffusion from the culture medium. In addition, the cell viability after 24 h incubation decreases as the laser fluence or alginate concentration increases.									11	0	0	6	0	11			1758-5082	1758-5090		WOS:000341823500022	25121715

Depending on environmental factors, in situ leachate samples collected from the field are often less than 20 mL. Due to the time and resource commitment of N and P analysis, it is desirable for many samples to be collected before analysis is conducted. In addition, past research has documented that acid preservation of low volume samples for N analysis can lead to inaccurate P measurements. Two experiments conducted in June 2007 and August 2008 compared ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N) and nitrite-nitrogen plus nitrate-nitrogen (NO2-N + NO3-N) concentrations within low volume samples preserved by freezing to other commonly used preservation techniques, including the accepted USEPA method. All preservation methods, including storage at less than -20 degrees C, resulted in NH3 and NO2 + NO3 concentrations similar to concentrations measured in immediately analyzed aliquots. Freezing low volume leachate water samples for later N analysis is an adequate method of preservation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0011-183X	1435-0653		WOS:000341489800041

Drawing from social learning theory (Bandura, 1973), we argue that supervisors' history of family aggression indirectly impacts abusive supervision via both hostile cognitions and hostile affect, with angry rumination functioning as a first-stage moderator. Using multisource data, we tested the proposed relationships in a series of 4 studies, each providing evidence of constructive replication. In Study 1, we found positive relationships between supervisors' history of family aggression, hostile affect, explicit hostile cognitions, and abusive supervision. We obtained the same pattern of results in Studies 2, 3, and 4 using an implicit measure of hostile cognitions and controlling for previously established antecedents of abusive supervision. Angry rumination moderated the indirect relationship between supervisors' history of family aggression and abusive supervision via hostile affect only. Overall, the results highlight the important role of supervisor-level factors in the abusive supervision dynamics.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0021-9010	1939-1854		WOS:000341842200007

We theorize that rather than having a linear association, the performance benefits of team efficacy reach a point of inflection, reflective of too much of a good thing. Further, in an effort to establish a boundary condition of the inverted-U shaped relationship we predict, we also test the moderating role played by team goal monitoring in the nonmonotonic relationship between team efficacy and team performance. The results from a lagged field test, in which we collect multisource data from 153 technology sales teams, reveal a significant curvilinear association that is moderated by team goal monitoring behavior. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0021-9010	1939-1854		WOS:000341842200012	24865579

Xia, Yuqiang/0000-0002-2969-163X; Zhao, Lin/0000-0003-1959-4120			Numerical study of wave effects on groundwater flow and solute transport in a laboratory beach								JOURNAL OF CONTAMINANT HYDROLOGY				165				37	52		10.1016/j.jconhyd.2014.07.001			SEP 2014	2014	A numerical study was undertaken to investigate the effects of waves on groundwater flow and associated inland-released solute transport based on tracer experiments in a laboratory beach. The MARUN model was used to simulate the density-dependent groundwater flow and subsurface solute transport in the saturated and unsaturated regions of the beach subjected to waves. The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software, Fluent, was used to simulate waves, which were the seaward boundary condition for MARUN. A no-wave case was also simulated for comparison. Simulation results matched the observed water table and concentration at numerous locations. The results revealed that waves generated seawater groundwater circulations in the swash and surf zones of the beach, which induced a large seawater groundwater exchange across the beach face. In comparison to the no-wave case, waves significantly increased the residence time and spreading of inland-applied solutes in the beach. Waves also altered solute pathways and shifted the solute discharge zone further seaward. Residence Time Maps (RTM) revealed that the wave-induced residence time of the inland-applied solutes was largest near the solute exit zone to the sea. Sensitivity analyses suggested that the change in the permeability in the beach altered solute transport properties in a nonlinear way. Due to the slow movement of solutes in the unsaturated zone, the mass of the solute in the unsaturated zone, which reached up to 10% of the total mass in some cases, constituted a continuous slow release of solutes to the saturated zone of the beach. This means of control was not addressed in prior studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									13	0	0	5	0	13			0169-7722	1873-6009		WOS:000341899000004	25108178

Thermal and Nonthermal Factors Affecting Survival of Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes in Animal Manure-Based Compost Mixtures								JOURNAL OF FOOD PROTECTION				77	9			1512	1518		10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-14-111			SEP 2014	2014	Reduction of enteric pathogens in animal manures before field application is essential for mitigating the risk of foodborne illness associated with produce. Aerobic composting of manures has been advocated as an effective treatment for reducing pathogen populations, and heat is a major factor contributing to pathogen inactivation. This study was initiated to determine the potential contribution of both thermal and nonthermal (pH, volatile acids, and ammonia) factors to pathogen inactivation during aerobic composting in bioreactors for mixtures containing manure from various sources (dairy, chicken, and swine). The test mixtures were formulated with an initial moisture content of 60% and a C:N ratio of 20:1, using straw and cottonseed meal as amendments. Mixtures were then inoculated with Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes labeled with green fluorescent protein at initial populations of ca. 10(7) CFU/g. Three replicate trials of each treatment were conducted. Temperatures within the bioreactors were recorded at 30-min intervals, and duplicate samples were withdrawn daily from two sampling locations within the bioreactor. Significant regression models were derived relating decreases in pathogen populations to the degree of heat generated in the mixture (cumulative heat) and the pH of the mixture on the day before the pathogen losses were calculated (P < 0.0002). Although pathogens in swine manure compost mixtures were inactivated by the third day of composting, very little heat was generated in these mixtures, which were characterized by significantly higher levels of volatile acids compared with the other two compost mixtures. Therefore, volatile acids could help achieve pathogen inactivation when temperatures are too low such as when heat is lost too quickly at the surface of static compost piles or during winter composting.									6	0	0	6	0	6			0362-028X	1944-9097		WOS:000341856300008	25198842	
J	Chen, Zhaoxi; Peng, Fei								Normal and Abnormal Grain Growths in BaTiO3 Fibers								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CERAMIC SOCIETY				97	9			2755	2761		10.1111/jace.13034			SEP 2014	2014	The grain growth mechanisms along the BaTiO3 fibers were studied between 1150 degrees C and 1250 degrees C. The normal grain growth always reached a stagnant stage after certain heat-treatment duration caused by the surface pinning effect. However, the abnormal grain growth (AGG) was not pinned by such surface effect, and can grow continuously. The confined normal grain (or matrix grain) size provides the driving force for AGG. The fiber diameter has an important influence on the grain growth behaviors. Submicrometer fibers have relative small stagnant grain sizes, resulting in large driving force for AGG. Abnormal grain growth occurred below 1200 degrees C in the submicrometer diameter fibers, but was not observed at the same temperature in the fibers with diameter of above 1m. Due to the large AGG driving force, large number densities of abnormal grains were observed in submicrometer fibers, resulting in bamboo-like microstructure. Fibers with diameters of 1-2m were able to be converted into single crystal fibers up to several tens of micrometers due to the relative small AGG driving forces.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000341826500012

Predicting the audience challenge in cross-sex friendships								PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS				21	3			387	403		10.1111/pere.12040			SEP 2014	2014	Cross-sex friends experience a variety of challenges including the audience challenge: when cross-sex friends are mistaken for a romantic couple by other members of their social network. This research sought to explore the various factors that might influence cross-sex friends' experience of the audience challenge. Cross-sex friends who were strictly platonic were less likely to experience the audience challenge and less likely to be concerned about the audience challenge than individuals in mutual romance, desires romance, or reject romance friendships. Regression analyses indicated cross-sex friends tend to experience the audience challenge the least when their friendship network is supportive of cross-sex friends. The relation between network support and the audience challenge is moderated by romantic desire and sexual activity.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1350-4126	1475-6811		WOS:000341834200002

An investigation of semiphysical artificial neural networks for multi-fuel combustion phasing control of spark ignition engines								PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART D-JOURNAL OF AUTOMOBILE ENGINEERING				228	11			1262	1273		10.1177/0954407014530692			SEP 2014	2014	The number of engine control actuators and potential fuel sources are constantly increasing to meet fuel economy targets and global energy demand. The increased engine control complexity resulting from new actuators and fuels motivates the use of model-based control methodologies over map-based empirical approaches. Purely physics-based control techniques have the potential to decrease calibration burdens but must be complex to represent nonlinear engine behavior with low computational requirements. Artificial neural networks are recognized as powerful tools for modeling systems which exhibit nonlinear relationships, but they lack physical significance. Combining these two techniques to produce semiphysical artificial neural network models which provide acceptable accuracy while minimizing the artificial neural network size, the calibration effort and the computational intensity is the focus of this research. To minimize the size of the neural network, sensitivity analyses are carried out on the critical inputs and the minimum number of required neurons. The most critical physical parameters are selected as follows: the laminar flame speed; the turbulence intensity; the total in-cylinder mass. The control algorithm derivation is described, and the process validated in real time using an engine dynamometer. The real-time experimental results demonstrate that the semiphysical artificial neural network approach can produce accurate ignition timing control for both gasoline and E85. Robustness of the semiphysical neural network approach is also discussed on the basis of the real-time experimental results.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0954-4070	2041-2991		WOS:000341879600002

The current study examined whether stereotypes about the perceived age and gender of anthropomorphic technology interacted with reliability to affect trust in such technology. Participants included a cross-section of younger and older adults. Through a factorial survey, participants responded to health-related vignettes containing anthropomorphic technology with a specific age, gender, and level of past reliability by rating their trust in the system. Trust in the technology was affected by the age and gender of the user as well as its appearance and reliability. Perceptions of anthropomorphic technology can be affected by pre-existing stereotypes about the capability of a specific age or gender.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0014-0139	1366-5847		WOS:000340884200001	24935771

Urbanization and stream salamanders: a review, conservation options, and research needs								FRESHWATER SCIENCE				33	3			927	940		10.1086/677556			SEP 2014	2014	Urban areas are increasing in size and human population density. The implications of widespread urbanization are apparent for a wide variety of stream organisms, but the responses of stream-dwelling salamanders to urbanization have been understudied historically. Studies on this assemblage have increased sufficiently over the last decade to warrant a review and synthesis of current knowledge. Our survey of the literature indicates a research bias toward species within the Piedmont ecoregion of the USA and a strong emphasis on changes in species richness, relative abundance, and occupancy along an urbanization gradient. Very few investigators have examined vital rates for specific life stages, population dynamics over extended periods, or mechanistic explanations for the specific aspects of urbanization that drive species loss and decline. We reviewed a broad array of literature on stream salamanders to identify the key abiotic and biotic drivers that explain species responses in urban watersheds. Based on these findings and the applied ecological literature, we identified conservation options for urban areas where decision makers and stakeholders wish to preserve stream salamanders and their habitats. We have listed 7 future research priorities that will further efforts to conserve stream salamanders in rapidly urbanizing regions.									6	0	0	6	0	6			2161-9549	2161-9565		WOS:000340580700022

Effects of Intelligent Advanced Warnings on Drivers Negotiating the Dilemma Zone								HUMAN FACTORS				56	6			1021	1035		10.1177/0018720814525438			SEP 2014	2014	Objective: We investigated whether intelligent advanced warnings of the end of green traffic signals help drivers negotiate the dilemma zone (DZ) at signalized intersections and sought to identify behavioral mechanisms for any warning-related benefits.Background: Prior research suggested that warnings of end of green can increase slowing and stopping frequency given the DZ, but drivers may sometimes respond to warnings by speeding up.Method: In two simulator studies, we compared six types of roadway or in-vehicle warnings with a no-warning control condition. Using multilevel modeling, we tested mediation models of the behavioral mechanisms underlying the effects of warnings.Results: In both studies, warnings led to more stopping at DZ intersections and milder decelerations when stopping compared with no warning. Drivers' predominant response to warnings was anticipatory slowing on approaching the intersection, not speeding up. The increased stopping with warning was mediated by increased slowing. In Study 1, anticipatory slowing given warnings generalized to green-light intersections where no warning was given. In Study 2, we found that lane-specific warnings (e. g., LED lights embedded in each lane) sometimes led to fewer unsafe emergency stops than did non-lane-specific roadside warnings.Conclusion: End-of-green warnings led to safer behavior in the DZ and on the early approach to intersections. The main mechanism for the benefits of warnings was drivers' increased anticipatory slowing on approaching an intersection. Lane-specific warnings may have some benefits over roadside warnings.Application: Applications include performance models of how drivers use end-of-green warnings, control algorithms and warning displays for intelligent intersections, and statistical methodology in human factors research.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0018-7208	1547-8181		WOS:000340827100001	25277014

At the same time, average annualized indices often do not effectively convey a complete picture of load-point reliabilities in microgrids integrated with multiple weather-dependent microsources. The primary goal of this work is to investigate the impacts of protection system and operating conditions on the reliability indices of a microgrid. The proposed method utilizes a short-term outage model that quantifies the relationship between state variables and the outage rate of component. A hybrid approach is proposed, which combines scenario selection and enumerative analysis. Simulations on a test system illustrate the dependence of operational reliability on factors such as local meteorological conditions, correlation between variable generation and loads, as well as the effects of protection system operations. Finally, some recommendations on the parameter settings of protection system are provided to enhance the system reliability.									9	3	0	0	0	12			0885-8950	1558-0679		WOS:000341190700025

Ballistic-Failure Mechanisms in Gas Metal Arc Welds of Mil A46100 Armor-Grade Steel: A Computational Investigation								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				23	9			3108	3125		10.1007/s11665-014-1090-9			SEP 2014	2014	In our recent work, a multi-physics computational model for the conventional gas metal arc welding (GMAW) joining process was introduced. The model is of a modular type and comprises five modules, each designed to handle a specific aspect of the GMAW process, i.e.: (i) electro-dynamics of the welding-gun; (ii) radiation-/convection-controlled heat transfer from the electric-arc to the workpiece and mass transfer from the filler-metal consumable electrode to the weld; (iii) prediction of the temporal evolution and the spatial distribution of thermal and mechanical fields within the weld region during the GMAW joining process; (iv) the resulting temporal evolution and spatial distribution of the material microstructure throughout the weld region; and (v) spatial distribution of the as-welded material mechanical properties. In the present work, the GMAW process model has been upgraded with respect to its predictive capabilities regarding the spatial distribution of the mechanical properties controlling the ballistic-limit (i.e., penetration-resistance) of the weld. The model is upgraded through the introduction of the sixth module in the present work in recognition of the fact that in thick steel GMAW weldments, the overall ballistic performance of the armor may become controlled by the (often inferior) ballistic limits of its weld (fusion and heat-affected) zones. To demonstrate the utility of the upgraded GMAW process model, it is next applied to the case of butt-welding of a prototypical high-hardness armor-grade martensitic steel, MIL A46100. The model predictions concerning the spatial distribution of the material microstructure and ballistic-limit-controlling mechanical properties within the MIL A46100 butt-weld are found to be consistent with prior observations and general expectations.									10	0	0	0	0	10			1059-9495	1544-1024		WOS:000341089200005

Parasitic castration in slipper limpets infested by the symbiotic crab Calyptraeotheres garthi								MARINE BIOLOGY				161	9			2107	2120		10.1007/s00227-014-2490-y			SEP 2014	2014	Two ill-explored hypotheses might explain host castration by parasitic pea crabs. The 'energy drain' hypothesis states that castration is caused by host-derived nutrient consumption of parasites that ultimately diminishes host-energy intake. The 'steric interference' hypothesis states that castration occurs when parasites physically inhibit host reproduction. This study evaluated whether Calyptraeotheres garthi, a pea crab from the southwestern Atlantic, is a parasitic castrator and explored whether the two hypotheses above explain castration in the limpet Crepidula cachimilla. None of three studied limpet species brooded embryos during the reproductive season when infested by mature female pea crabs. Also, limpets of C. cachimilla infested by C. garthi did not reproduce during a 90-day experimental period while crab-free limpets did spawn embryos during this period. Limpets resumed reproduction soon after pea crabs were experimentally removed from their brooding chamber. Thus, C. garthi does castrate limpets, and castration is reversible. Pea crabs 'steal' food from limpets, and infested limpets did not modify their feeding behavior to counteract nutrient loss. Thus, infested limpets are expected to ingest less food which provides partial support for the 'energy drain' hypothesis. However, the limpet's body condition increased or was not affected by pea crabs during the breeding season which argues against the same hypothesis. Furthermore, that limpets promptly recovered reproductive activity once pea crabs were experimentally removed, that castration was not induced by the smallest pea crabs in the population (that fill only partially the brooding chamber), and that parasitized limpets did exhibit fully mature ovaries, support the 'steric interference' hypothesis explaining parasitic castration.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0025-3162	1432-1793		WOS:000340869600012

Here we present a scalable roll-to-roll process for synthesizing vertically-aligned multi-walled carbon nanotubes (VACNTs) on Al foil ribbons which are continuously drawn through a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) reactor operating at ambient pressure and a relatively low growth temperature (600 degrees C). Electrodes comprised of VACNT forests synthesized in this process are directly assembled into supercapacitor cells, which yield high power densities (1270 W/kg) and energy densities (11.5 Wh/kg). These devices exhibit excellent cycle stability with no loss in performance over more than a thousand cycles. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

We sought to describe the pathogens, incidence, risk factors and mortality of late-onset BSI in hospitalized term infants.Methods: A cohort study was conducted of infants >= 37 weeks gestational age and <= 120 days of age discharged from Pediatrix Medical Group neonatal intensive care units from 1997 to 2010. We examined all cultures obtained from day of life 4-120 and used multivariable regression to assess risk factors for late-onset BSI.Results: We found a total of 206,019 infants cared for between day of life 4 and 120, and the incidence of late-onset BSI was 2.7/1000 admissions. We identified Gram-positive organisms in 64% of the cultures and -Gram-negative organisms in 26%. We found a decreased risk of late-onset BSI in infants with the following characteristics: small for gestational age, delivery by Cesarean, antenatal antibiotic use and discharged in the later years of the study. Late-onset BSI increased the risk of death after controlling for confounders [odds ratio 8.43 (95% confidence interval 4.42-16.07)].Conclusion: Our data highlight the importance of late-onset BSI in hospitalized term infants. We identified Gram-positive organisms as the most common pathogen, and late-onset BSI was an independent risk factor for death.									4	0	0	2	0	4			0891-3668	1532-0987		WOS:000341017100010	24618934

The current pilot and exploratory study investigated teaching pre-driving skills (i.e. lane keeping and speed maintenance) to young adults with intellectual disabilities using an interactive driving simulator to provide dynamic and immediate feedback to participants as well as quantifiable data to researchers and educators. Four students from a post-secondary transition course for students with intellectual disabilities (age 21-23) with an average full-scale IQ of 71.5 (range 64-76) participated. Participants practised their pre-driving skills (lane keeping and speed maintenance rather than complex driving environments) on a series of driving courses as well as a coordinated muscle movement activity related to driving for 1 h a day, 5 days a week. After 27 days, two of the four participants significantly improved their lane keeping and speed maintenance skills, while two participants failed to demonstrate steady improvement.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1354-4187	1468-3156		WOS:000340533600005

They were analysed by sensory evaluation and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The former technique showed that the CP essential oil (CP-EO), MAE and UAE extracts possessed similar odour profiles to the natural pummelo odour, whereas the SDE extract and WD essential oil (WD-EO) presented the fermented/overripe and alcohol/pungent notes, and the SFE extract had a sweet note. Although the GC-MS analyses revealed the six extracts had a certain degree of differences in their compositions, they had similar major volatiles, including limonene (301 476-497 028 mu g/ml), beta-myrcene (86 400-230 400 mu g/ml), beta-pinene (1370-7129 mu g/ml), linalool (1916-4482 mu g/ml) and germacrene D (1165-2327 mu g/ml). Analyses of odour activity values (OAVs) and cluster analysis revealed the fermented/overripe and alcohol/pungent notes of the SDE extract and WD-EO were attributed to nerol, geraniol and linalool oxide. The sweet note of the SFE extract was ascribed to citronellal and limonene oxide. Besides, a lack of limonene, neral and geranial resulted in a light green aroma of the SFE extract. This information might be valuable for further development of aromatically desirable products from citrus fruits.

Exploring faculty experiences in a striving university through the lens of academic capitalism								STUDIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION				39	7			1097	1115		10.1080/03075079.2013.777401			SEP 2014	2014	In this paper, we draw from academic capitalism to explore the work lives and experiences of faculty who work in a striving university. Our analysis suggests that faculty members feel pressures induced by academic capitalism, including a lack of space, no time and the sense of constant surveillance. Our work adds to the theoretical as well as empirical discussions concerning striving, academic capitalism and the impacts of both on the academic profession.									8	0	1	0	1	10			0307-5079	1470-174X		WOS:000340358500001

Increased belowground carbon inputs and warming promote loss of soil organic carbon through complementary microbial responses								SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY				76				57	69		10.1016/j.soilbio.2014.04.028			SEP 2014	2014	Current carbon cycle-climate models predict that future soil carbon storage will be determined by the balance between CO2 fertilization and warming. However, it is uncertain whether greater carbon inputs to soils with elevated CO2 will be sequestered, particularly since warming hastens soil carbon decomposition rates, and may alter the response of soils to new plant inputs. We studied the effects of elevated CO2 and warming on microbial soil carbon decomposition processes using laboratory manipulations of carbon inputs and soil temperature. We incubated soils from the Aspen Free Air CO2 Enrichment experiment, where no accumulation of soil carbon has been observed despite a decade of increased carbon inputs to soils under elevated CO2. We added isotopically-labeled sucrose to these soils in the laboratory to mimic and trace the effects of increased carbon inputs on soil organic carbon decomposition and its temperature sensitivity. Sucrose additions caused a positive priming of soil organic carbon decomposition, demonstrated by increased respiration derived from soil carbon, increased microbial abundance, and a shift in the microbial community towards faster growing microorganisms. Similar patterns were observed for elevated CO2 soils, suggesting that the priming effect was responsible for reductions in soil carbon accumulation at the site. Laboratory warming accelerated the rate of the priming effect, but the magnitude of the priming effect was not different amongst temperatures, suggesting that the priming effect was limited by substrate availability, not soil temperature. No changes in substrate use efficiency were observed with elevated CO2 or warming. The stimulatory effects of warming on the priming effect suggest that increased belowground carbon inputs from CO2 fertilization are not likely to be stored in mineral soils. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Politics, Religion, Attribution Theory, and Attitudes Toward Same-Sex Unions								SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY				95	3			701	718		10.1111/ssqu.12085			SEP 2014	2014	Objective. The relationship between beliefs about the cause of homosexuality, political and religious ideology, and attitudes toward same-sex unions in the United States is unclear. This study aims to examine the mediating influence and socially embedded nature of attribution beliefs at a time when attitudes toward same-sex unions are undergoing substantial changes in the American public. Method. This study employs simultaneous equation path models and a recent national, random sample of American adults (Baylor Religion Survey 2010) to test each hypothesis. Results. Results reveal that constructed opinions about the origin and controllability of homosexuality significantly influence support for same-sex unions. However, these opinions are socially embedded, especially within particular political and religious ideologies. Conclusion. These findings highlight that while widespread changes in beliefs about the cause of homosexuality may presage shifts in support for same-sex unions, many will be able to resist those shifts toward support, possibly leading to their further marginalization within society.									11	0	0	0	0	11			0038-4941	1540-6237		WOS:000339547800006

Fecundity (n degrees early embryos female(-1)) was examined during 2007 at four different localities (Iguape, Registro, Sete Barras, and Eldorado) along a stretch of river extending over 85 km (Ribeira de Iguape, Sao Paulo State, Brazil). Also, fertility (n degrees hatched larvae female(-1)) was examined at one locality (Registro) during 2009-2010. Fecundity (mean +/- SD: 5191 +/- 2635; range: 1086-13,014 embryos female(-1)) did not vary throughout the segment of river studied. Fecundity increased with female body size (carapace length, CL). However, fecundity scaled negatively with shrimp body size; females produce disproportionably fewer eggs with a unit increase in CL. The conditions explaining the negative allometric relationship between fecundity and female body size in M. acanthurus remain to be addressed. Nevertheless, natural food constraints limiting the ability of large but not small females to acquire enough resources to produce and fill their gonads with oocytes represents a plausible explanation for the negative scaling of fecundity with body size. Fertility varied between 545 and 12,465 hatched larvae female(-1) with an average (+/- SD) of 3981 (+/- 2693) and increased isometrically with a unit increase in female body size. M. acanthurus has an average fecundity and fertility that represents one of the extremes regarding the trade-off between fecundity/fertility and egg-size reported for caridean shrimps. All of this information needs to be considered in assessing shrimp stocks and establishing a sustainable management plan for this exploited species in the southwestern Atlantic.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0792-4259	2157-0272		WOS:000338105700007

Participants were 24 visually normal adults (12 young M = 26.8 years; 12 older M = 72.9 years). Visual acuity, contrast sensitivity and glare sensitivity were recorded for each participant. Experimenters acting as road workers walked in place on a closed road circuit within simulated road work sites, facing either the oncoming driver or the roadway (presenting sideways to the driver) and wearing one of four clothing conditions: (i) standard road worker vest; (ii) standard vest plus thigh-mounted retroreflective strips; (iii) standard vest plus retroreflective strips on ankles and knees; (iv) standard vest plus retroreflective strips positioned on the extremities in a configuration that conveyed biological motion ("biomotion"). As they drove along the closed road participants were instructed to press a button to indicate when they first recognized that a road worker was present. The results demonstrated that regardless of the direction of walking, road workers wearing biomotion clothing were recognized at significantly (p < 0.05) longer distances (3x), relative to the standard vest alone. Response distances were significantly shorter for the older drivers. Contrast sensitivity was a better predictor of the ability to recognize road workers than was visual acuity or glare sensitivity. We conclude that adding retroreflective strips in the biomotion configuration can significantly improve road worker conspicuity regardless of the road worker's orientation and the age of the driver.

This is a mixed-integer linear program and an extension of the classical two-stage stochastic location-transportation model. The proposed model optimizes not only costs but also emissions in the supply chain. The model captures the impact of biomass supply and technology uncertainty on supply chain-related decisions; the tradeoffs that exist between location and transportation decisions; and the tradeoffs between costs and emissions in the supply chain. The objective function and model constraints reflect the impact of different carbon regulatory policies, such as carbon cap, carbon tax, carbon cap-and-trade, and carbon offset mechanisms on supply chain decisions. We solve this problem using algorithms that combine Lagrangian relaxation and L-shaped solution methods, and we develop a case study using data from the state of Mississippi. The results from the computational analysis point to important observations about the impacts of carbon regulatory mechanisms as well as the uncertainties on the performance of biocrude supply chains.

Evaluation of fouling mechanisms in asymmetric microfiltration membranes using advanced imaging								JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE				465				1	13		10.1016/j.merusci.2014.03.077			SEP 1 2014	2014	This contribution details the use of advanced microscopy to study the fouling of asymmetric polyethersulfone membranes during the microfiltration of protein (casein), polyphenol (tannic acid), and polysaccharide (beta-cyclodextrin) mixtures to better understand the solute solute and solute membrane interactions leading to fouling. Fluorescently labeled probes were used to visualize the fouling profiles of individual components within the wet membrane structure with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Cross-sectional CLSM imaging provided information on the location and extent of fouling throughout the entire thickness of the PES membrane, overcoming the depth of penetration limit observed by researchers in previous studies. Quantitative analysis of the crosssectional CLSM images provided a measurement of the masses of foulard:5 deposited throughout the membrane. Moreover, flux decline data were collected for different mixtures of casein, tannic acid and beta-cyclodextrin (model foulants) and were analyzed with standard fouling models to determine the fouling mechanisms at play when processing different combinations of foularnts. Results from modal analysis of flux data were compared with the quantitative visual analysis of the correspondent CLSM images. This approach, which couples visual and performance measurements, is expected to provide a better understanding of the causes of fouling that, in turn, is expected to aid in the design of new membranes with tailored structure or surface chemistries that prevent the deposition of the foulants in "prone to foul" regions.

Finite element formulation is developed for the theoretical CBR/Poisson model. The FECBR approach is accelerated through eigen-pair reduction, lead mode space projection, and component mode synthesis techniques. The accelerated FECBR is applied to perform quantum mechanical ballistic transport analysis of a DG-MOSFET with taper-shaped extensions and a DG-MOSFET with Si/SiO2 interface roughness. The computed electrical transport properties of the devices obtained from the accelerated FECBR approach and associated computational cost as a function of system degrees of freedom are compared with those obtained from the original CBR and direct inversion methods. The performance of the accelerated FECBR in both its accuracy and efficiency is demonstrated. (c) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0021-8979	1089-7550		WOS:000342821600070

Diane; Clark, Leigh Anne								A COLQ Missense Mutation in Labrador Retrievers Having Congenital Myasthenic Syndrome								PLOS ONE				9	8					e106425	10.1371/journal.pone.0106425			AUG 28 2014	2014	Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMSs) are heterogeneous neuromuscular disorders characterized by skeletal muscle weakness caused by disruption of signal transmission across the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). CMSs are rarely encountered in veterinary medicine, and causative mutations have only been identified in Old Danish Pointing Dogs and Brahman cattle to date. Herein, we characterize a novel CMS in 2 Labrador Retriever littermates with an early onset of marked generalized muscle weakness. Because the sire and dam share 2 recent common ancestors, CMS is likely the result of recessive alleles inherited identical by descent (IBD). Genome-wide SNP profiles generated from the Illumina HD array for 9 nuclear family members were used to determine genomic inheritance patterns in chromosomal regions encompassing 18 functional candidate genes. SNP haplotypes spanning 3 genes were consistent with autosomal recessive transmission, and microsatellite data showed that only the segment encompassing COLQ was inherited IBD. COLQ encodes the collagenous tail of acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme responsible for termination of signal transduction in the NMJ. Sequences from COLQ revealed a variant in exon 14 (c.1010T>C) that results in the substitution of a conserved amino acid (I337T) within the C-terminal domain. Both affected puppies were homozygous for this variant, and 16 relatives were heterozygous, while 288 unrelated Labrador Retrievers and 112 dogs of other breeds were wild-type. A recent study in which 2 human CMS patients were found to be homozygous for an identical COLQ mutation (c.1010T>C; I337T) provides further evidence that this mutation is pathogenic. This report describes the first COLQ mutation in canine CMS and demonstrates the utility of SNP profiles from nuclear family members for the identification of private mutations.									5	0	0	2	0	5			1932-6203			WOS:000341303700091	25166616

In this work, highly C-13-enriched carbon nanopartides were prepared to allow their quantification in biological samples by using isotope-ratio mass spectroscopy. The in vivo biodistribution results are presented and discussed, and also compared with those of the aqueous suspended carbon nanotubes reported previously. The distribution profile and time dependencies are largely similar between the nanoparticles and nanotubes, with results on both suggesting meaningful accumulation in some major organs over an extended period of time. Therefore, the surface modification of carbon nanoparticles, preferably the chemical functionalization of the nanoparticles with biocompatible molecules or species, is desirable or necessary in the pursuit of these nanomaterials for various bioapplications.									10	2	0	6	0	12			1944-8244			WOS:000341122000162	25068474

The particles have a yolk-in-shell morphology, with a radioluminescent core, an upconverting shell, and a hollow region between the core and shell for loading drugs. They are synthesized by controlled encapsulation of a radioluminescent nanophosphor yolk in a silica shell, partial etching of the yolk in acid, and encapsulation of the silica with an upconverting luminescent shell. Metroxantrone, a chemotherapy drug, was loaded into the hollow space between X-ray phosphor yolk and up-conversion phosphor shell through pores in the shell. To encapsulate the drug and control the release rate, the nanoparticles are coated with pH-responsive biocompatible polyelectrolyte layers of charged hyaluronic acid sodium salt and chitosan. The nanophosphors display bright luminescence under X-ray, blue light (480 nm), and near infrared light (980 nm). They also served as T-1 and T-2 MRI contrast agents with relaxivities of 3.5 mM(-1) s(-1) (r(1)) and 64 mM(-1) s(-1) (r(2)).

We show that the electrophilicity of the diazofluorene appears to be a significant determinant of DNA damaging activity. These studies identify the monomeric diazofluorene 11 as a potent DNA cleavage agent in tissue culture. The simpler structure of 11 relative to the natural products establishes it as a useful lead for translational studies.									7	0	0	6	0	7			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000342676100038	25044348

Here, by combining two different bioinformatical methods - a method based on ordinary differential equations (Time Series Network Inference) and an algebraic method (probabilistic polynomial dynamical systems) - we identified the IRE1 alpha-XBP1 and the ATF6 pathways as the main UPR effectors involved in cell's adaptation to IRI. We validated these findings experimentally by assessing the impact of their knock-out and knock-down on cell survival during IRI. (C) 2014 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

The counter ion in the solid state is the ammonium cation in a monoclinic crystal cell with, P2(1)/c. The X-ray structure is similar to the structure generated from the analogous nitro substituted dipicolinate ligand. When exploring reactions of this and other dipicolinate-containing compounds with L-ascorbic acid, both vanadium(IV) and vanadium(III) species were formed under acidic conditions; then identified by conventional (X-band) and high-frequency and -field electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. A reaction with half an equivalent of L-ascorbic acid led to the formation of vanadium(IV) species, and addition of substituents (X = H, Cl, Br, OH, and NH2) in the para position of dipicolinic acid did not have a major effect on the vanadium(IV) species formed. In a reaction with excess L-ascorbic acid and vanadium(V)dipic-X complexes (where X = H, Cl, Br, OH, and NH2), vanadium(III) species were observed, thus proving that vanadium(III) species can be formed under acidic conditions resembling those in biological systems.

Gene discovery and differential expression analysis of humoral immune response elements in female Culicoides sonorensis (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae)								PARASITES & VECTORS				7						388	10.1186/1756-3305-7-388			AUG 21 2014	2014	Background: Female Culicoides sonorensis midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) are vectors of pathogens that impact livestock and wildlife in the United States. Little is known about their biology on a molecular-genetic level, including components of their immune system. Because the insect immune response is involved with important processes such as gut microbial homeostasis and vector competence, our aims were to identify components of the midge innate immune system and examine their expression profiles in response to diet across time.Methods: In our previous work, we de novo sequenced and analyzed the transcriptional landscape of female midges under several feeding states including teneral (unfed) and early and late time points after blood and sucrose. Here, those transcriptomes were further analyzed to identify insect innate immune orthologs, particularly humoral immune response elements. Additionally, we examined immune gene expression profiles in response to diet over time, on both a transcriptome-wide, whole-midge level and more specifically via qRTPCR analysis of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) expression in the alimentary canal.Results: We identified functional units comprising the immune deficiency (Imd), Toll and JAK/STAT pathways, including humoral factors, transmembrane receptors, signaling components, transcription factors/regulators and effectors such as AMPs. Feeding altered the expression of receptors, regulators, AMPs, prophenoloxidase and thioester-containing proteins, where blood had a greater effect than sucrose on the expression profiles of most innate immune components. qRTPCR of AMP genes showed that all five were significantly upregulated in the alimentary canal after blood feeding, possibly in response to proliferating populations of gut bacteria.Conclusions: Identification and functional insight of humoral/innate immune components in female C. sonorensis updates our knowledge of the molecular biology of this important vector. Because diet alone influenced the expression of immune pathway components, including their effectors, subsequent study of the role of innate immunity in biological processes such as gut homeostasis and life history are being pursued. Furthermore, since the humoral response is a key contributor in gut immunity, manipulating immune gene expression will help in uncovering genetic components of vector competence, including midgut barriers to infection. The results of such studies will serve as a platform for designing novel transmission-blocking strategies.									5	0	0	1	0	5			1756-3305			WOS:000341203200001	25145345	
J	Xiao, Junhua; Juang, C. Hsein; Xu, Changjie; Li, Xiongwei; Wang, Lei				Wang, Lei/M-6627-2015				Strength and deformation characteristics of compacted silt from the lower reaches of the Yellow River of China under monotonic and repeated loading								ENGINEERING GEOLOGY				178				49	57		10.1016/j.enggeo.2014.06.008			AUG 21 2014	2014	Silt is a widespread deposit in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, China with low plasticity and cohesion and poorly-graded characteristics. It is the primary filling material for subgrades in this region because of the lack of sand and gravel materials. Using the California Bearing Ratio (CBR) method alone to characterize the silt subgrade cannot provide an adequate assessment of its shear behaviors under monotonic and repeated loading. To improve the understanding of the strength and deformation characteristics of silt fill, a series of triaxial tests under monotonic and repeated loading were conducted. Specifically, the variations in the engineering characteristics (such as shear strength, permanent deformation, resilient modulus, and threshold stress) of silt fill caused by changes in the physical and stress states were investigated. Experimental results were used to establish empirical correlations for the strength and deformation parameters. These results provide a basis for the mechanical analysis and design of silt subgrades for stability. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Oh, Jung-Min; Park, Jiyoung; Kumbhar, Amar; Smith, Dennis, Jr.; Creager, Stephen								Electrochemical Oxygen Reduction at Platinum/Mesoporous Carbon/Zirconia/Ionomer Thin-Film Composite Electrodes								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				138				278	287		10.1016/j.electacta.2014.06.111			AUG 20 2014	2014	Platinum catalysts for electrochemical oxygen reduction were prepared on mesoporous carbon supports, some of which included embedded zirconia nanoparticles, by borohydride reduction of hexachloroplatinic acid in ethylene glycol solution. The resulting materials are approximately 20 percent platinum by weight and consist of platinum particles having diameters in the 2-3 nm range, evenly distributed throughout the support structure. Electrochemical surface areas for platinum were measured by hydrogen adsorption/desorption and carbon monoxide stripping and were found to be lower for platinum on carbon containing zirconia than for carbon without zirconia. This finding is thought to reflect a slightly larger platinum particle size and also a higher degree of particle aggregation for platinum on the carbon support containing zirconia, possibly caused by localized patches of positive charge on zirconia particles under the acidic conditions used to deposit platinum. Zirconia-containing carbon supports that had been treated with platinum were subsequently treated with polymer electrolytes having terminal aryl phosphonate groups that can covalently bind to exposed zirconia sites, thereby producing composite materials having intimately integrated platinum catalysts and polymer electrolytes immobilized within a mesoporous carbon support structure. Electrochemical ORR activity of these materials as thin-film electrodes was assessed using rotating disk electrode voltammetry in aqueous sulfuric acid solutions. Activity for platinum on a mesoporous carbon support without zirconia is comparable to that of benchmark materials, e.g., platinum on Vulcan carbon XC-72, but is diminished on the mesoporous carbon support containing zirconia. Remarkably, the platinum ORR activity is fully recovered and slightly enhanced on zirconia-containing supports following treatment with polymer electrolyte. Possible reasons for the recovery of the platinum ORR activity upon polymer electrolyte treatment, and implications for possible application in polyelectrolyte membrane fuel-cell technology, are discussed.

J	Brittain, Sean D.; Carr, John S.; Najita, Joan R.; Quanz, Sascha P.; Meyer, Michael R.								NIR SPECTROSCOPY OF THE HAeBe STAR HD 100546. III. FURTHER EVIDENCE OF AN ORBITING COMPANION?								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				791	2					136	10.1088/0004-637X/791/2/136			AUG 20 2014	2014	We report high-resolution NIR spectroscopy of CO and OH emission from the Herbig Be star HD 100546. We discuss how our results bear striking resemblance to several theoretically predicted signposts of giant planet formation. The properties of the CO and OH emission lines are consistent with our earlier interpretation that these diagnostics provide indirect evidence for a companion that orbits the star close to the disk wall (at similar to 13AU). The asymmetry of the OH spectral line profiles and their lack of time variability are consistent with emission from gas in an eccentric orbit at the disk wall that is approximately stationary in the inertial frame. The time variable spectroastrometric properties of the CO upsilon = 1-0 emission line point to an orbiting source of CO emission with an emitting area similar to that expected for a circumplanetary disk (similar to 0.1AU(2)) assuming the CO emission is optically thick. We also consider a counterhypothesis to this interpretation, namely that the variable CO emission arises from a bright spot on the disk wall. We conclude with a brief suggestion of further work that can distinguish between these scenarios.									16	0	0	0	0	16			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000340028400063

Batch kinetic experiments were conducted at plutonium concentrations between 10(-8) and 10(-6) M at pH 5 and 0.3 g/L (9.3 m(2)/L) hematite. Surface-mediated reduction of Pu(V) was observed under all conditions studied. However, differences in the reaction kinetics demonstrate that the mechanism of Pu(V) reduction changes as a function of plutonium concentration. Adsorption of Pu(V) was found to be the rate-limiting step at plutonium concentrations less than approximately 10(-7) M Pu(V). Plutonium reduction in these systems was attributed to trace amounts of Fe(II) in the hematite structure. Reduction of Pu(V) was found to be the rate-limiting step at concentrations higher than approximately 10(-6) M Pu(V) and is attributed to the formation of PuO2+x center dot nH(2)O nanoparticles and the Nernstian favorability of Pu(IV) surface complexes. The reaction order with respect to plutonium concentration was found to be -0.68 +/- 0.09, indicating that there is a concentration dependence in these systems. This work strongly suggests that the kinetics of experiments carried out under high plutonium concentrations (i.e., > 10(-7) M Pu) cannot be directly extrapolated to environmental concentrations of plutonium.									11	0	0	5	0	11			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000340701800039	25003955

The modification plays a crucial role in mediating protein-protein interactions in many biologically important processes. There is no well-defined sequence motif for TPST sulfation, and the underlying determinants of TPST sulfation specificity remains elusive. Here, we perform molecular modeling to uncover the structural and energetic determinants of TPST sulfation specificity.Results: We estimate the binding affinities between TPST and peptides around tyrosines of both sulfated and non-sulfated proteins to differentiate them. We find that better differentiation is achieved after including energy costs associated with local unfolding of the tyrosine-containing peptide in a host protein, which depends on both the peptide's secondary structures and solvent accessibility. Local unfolding renders buried peptide-with ordered structures-thermodynamically available for TPST binding. Our results suggest that both thermodynamic availability of the peptide and its binding affinity to the enzyme are important for TPST sulfation specificity, and their interplay results into great variations in sequences and structures of sulfated peptides. We expect our method to be useful in predicting potential sulfation sites and transferable to other TPST variants. Our study may also shed light on other PTM systems without well-defined sequence and structural specificities.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1367-4803	1460-2059		WOS:000342746000009	24794930	
J	Morales, Marlon S.; Ogale, Amod A.								Carbon Fibers Derived from UV-Assisted Stabilization of Wet-Spun Polyacrylonitrile Fibers								JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE				131	16					40623	10.1002/app.40623			AUG 15 2014	2014	A rapid, dual-stabilization route for the production of carbon fibers from polyacrylonitrile (PAN) precursor fibers is reported. A photoinitiator, 4,4-bis(diethylamino)benzophenone, was added to PAN solution before the fiber wet-spinning step. After a short UV treatment that induced cyclization and crosslinking at a lower temperature, precursor fibers could be rapidly thermo-oxidatively stabilized and successfully carbonized. Scanning electron microscopy micrographs show no deterioration of the microstructure or hollow-core formation in the fibers due to UV treatment or presence of photoinitiator. Fast-thermally stabilized pure PAN-based carbon fibers show hollow-core fiber defects due to inadequate thermal stabilization, but such defects were not observed in carbon fibers derived from fast-thermally stabilized fibers that contained photoinitiator and were UV treated. Tensile testing results confirm that fibers containing 1 wt % photoinitiator and UV treated for 5 min display higher tensile modulus than all other sets of thermally stabilized and carbonized fibers. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction results show a higher development of the aromatic structure and molecular orientation in thermally stabilized fibers. No significant increase in interplanar spacing or decrease in crystals size were observed within the UV-stabilized carbon fibers containing photoinitiator, but such fibers retain a higher extent of molecular orientation when compared with control fibers. These results establish for the first time, the positive effect of the external addition of photoinitiator and UV treatment on the properties of the PAN-based fibers, and may be used to reduce the precursor stabilization time for faster carbon fiber production rate.

This efficient approach relies on the first-order reliability method (FORM) and is implemented in a spreadsheet. The gamma sensitivity study is performed to identify the key input parameters in the reliability analysis. This study investigates the effect of the uncertainty in elastic modulus, layer thickness, design traffic as well as the model error of a three-layered pavement system on the reliability analysis. Comparison study shows that this efficient approach using FORM can yield results that are comparable with those obtained using Monte Carlo simulation. The advantages of this efficient approach include: it requires much less computational effort to determine probability of failure; it can be readily adapted for other mechanistic-empirical models for pavement design; it is easy to be adopted in the engineering practice and thus has the potential to become a practice tool in the reliability-based mechanistic-empirical pavement design.

To form these coatings, locking magnetic nanoparticles (LMNPs) made of a superparamagnetic core and a two-component polymer shell are employed. Two different polymers form phase-separated coaxial shells. The outer shell provides repulsive interactions between the LMNPs while the inner shell exerts attractive forces between the particles. Applying a non-uniform magnetic field, one gathers the particles together, pushing them to come in contact when the internal shells could effectively hold the particles together. When the magnetic field is turned off, the particles remain locked due to these strong interactions between internal shells. The shells are thus made stimuli-responsive, so this locking can be made reversible and the chains can be disintegrated on demand. In a non-uniform magnetic field, the assembled chains translocate, bind to the solid substrate and form anisotropic coatings with a "locked" anisotropic structure. The coatings can be constructed, aligned, realigned, degraded, and generated again on demand by changing the magnetic field and particle environment. The mechanism of the coating formation is explained using experimental observations and a theoretical model.									12	0	0	1	0	12			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000340549900002

This surface has to satisfy a special boundary condition at infinity. The proposed formulation allows one to interpret the meniscus problem as a problem of flow of a fictitious non-Newtonian fluid through a porous medium. As an example, the shape of a meniscus on a fibre of an oval cross section was analysed employing Chaplygin's hodograph transformation. It was discovered that the contact line may form singularities even if the fibre has a smooth profile: this statement was illustrated with an oval fibre profile having infinite curvature at two endpoints.									3	0	0	1	0	3			1364-5021	1471-2946		WOS:000338717400014	25104910

Here, we demonstrate super-resolution imaging of CDs at the nanoscale through STimulated Emission Depletion (STED) microscopy. In addition, we report the application of STED for detection of CD localization in both fixed and living cells, achieving a spatial resolution down to 30 nm, far below the diffraction limit, showing great promise for high resolution visualization of cellular dynamics.									18	2	0	1	0	20			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000339861500029	24983856

Objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate Sr transport through an 11-year-long field lysimeter study and (2) quantify secondary aging effects between Sr and sediment that may need to be considered for long-term transport modeling. Batch sorption/desorption tests were conducted with Sr-85, Sr-88, and Sr-90 using a sediment recovered from a field lysimeter containing a glass pellet amended with high-level nuclear waste for 24 years. Sr was largely reversibly and linearly sorbed. Sr-85 sorption coefficients (K-d, concentration ratios of solids/liquids) after a 23-day contact period were about the same as the Sr-90 desorption K-d values after a 24-year contact period: sorption K-d = 32.1 +/- 3.62 mL g(-1) and desorption K-d = 43.1 +/- 11.4 mL g(-1). Numerical modeling of the lysirneter Sr-90 depth profile indicated that a Kd value of 32 mL fit the data best. The Kd construct captured most of the data trends above and below the source term, except for immediately below the source where the model clearly overestimated Sr mobility. Sr-90 desorption tests suggested that the overestimated mobility may be attributed to a second, slower sorption reaction that occurs over a course of months to decades.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000340080600073	24960400	
J	Marko, Peter B.; Nance, Holly A.; van den Hurk, Peter								Seafood Substitutions Obscure Patterns of Mercury Contamination in Patagonian Toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) or "Chilean Sea Bass''								PLOS ONE				9	8					e104140	10.1371/journal.pone.0104140			AUG 5 2014	2014	Seafood mislabeling distorts the true abundance of fish in the sea, defrauds consumers, and can also cause unwanted exposure to harmful pollutants. By combining genetic data with analyses of total mercury content, we have investigated how species substitutions and fishery-stock substitutions obscure mercury contamination in Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides), also known as "Chilean sea bass''. Patagonian toothfish show wide variation in mercury concentrations such that consumers may be exposed to either acceptable or unacceptable levels of mercury depending on the geographic origins of the fish and the allowable limits of different countries. Most notably, stocks of Patagonian toothfish in Chile accumulate significantly more mercury than stocks closer to the South Pole, including the South Georgia/Shag Rocks stock, a fishery certified by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) as sustainably fished. Consistent with the documented geography of mercury contamination, our analysis showed that, on average, retail fish labeled as MSC-certified Patagonian toothfish had only half the mercury of uncertified fish. However, consideration of genetic data that were informative about seafood substitutions revealed a complex pattern of contamination hidden from consumers: species substitutions artificially inflated the expected difference in mercury levels between MSC-certified and uncertified fish whereas fishery stock substitutions artificially reduced the expected difference in mercury content between MSC-certified and uncertified fish that were actually D. eleginoides. Among MSC-certified fish that were actually D. eleginoides, several with exogenous mtDNA haplotypes (i.e., not known from the certified fishery) had mercury concentrations on par with uncertified fish from Chile. Overall, our analysis of mercury was consistent with inferences from the genetic data about the geographic origins of the fish, demonstrated the potential negative impact of seafood mislabeling on unwanted mercury exposure for consumers, and showed that fishery-stock substitutions may expose consumers to significantly greater mercury concentrations in retail-acquired fish than species substitutions.									3	0	0	2	0	3			1932-6203			WOS:000341357200071	25093736

Di- and mono-substituted anionic OlLs were prepared by neutralizing these compounds with N-methylimidazole. Aprotic anionic OlLs were synthesized by reaction of sodium salts of the prepared oligomeric di- and monoacids with 1,3-dimethyl imidazolium iodide. Hyperbranched protic and aprotic anionic OILS were prepared in a similar manner. The structure, thermal stability and ionic conductivity of the synthesized compounds in the range of 20-120 degrees C in anhydrous conditions is governed by the molecular architecture of the oligomeric chains and the type of the cation/anion moieties. OILS under study are amorphous at room temperature but some protic and aprotic linear-chain Ms prone to form a low melting temperature crystalline phase. The ionic conductivity of the synthesized OILS can be varied in broad range reaching 10(-3) S/cm value at temperatures over 100 degrees C under anhydrous conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

NDMA is classified as a probable carcinogen and thus its formation during chloramination has recently become the focus of considerable research interest. In this study, the formation mechanisms of NDMA from ranitidine and trimethylamine (TMA), as models of tertiary amines, during chloramination were investigated by using density functional theory (DFT). A new four-step formation pathway of NDMA was proposed involving nucleophilic substitution by chloramine, oxidation, and dehydration followed by nitrosation. The results suggested that nitrosation reaction is the rate-limiting step and determines the NDMA yield for tertiary amines. When 45 other tertiary amines were examined, the proposed mechanism was found to be more applicable to aromatic tertiary amines, and there may be still some additional factors or pathways that need to be considered for aliphatic tertiary amines. The heterolytic ONN(Me)(2)-R+ bond dissociation energy to release NDMA and carbocation R+ was found to be a criterion for evaluating the reactivity of aromatic tertiary amines. A structure-activity study indicates that tertiary amines with benzyl, aromatic heterocyclic ring, and diene-substituted methenyl adjacent to the DMA moiety are potentially significant NDMA precursors. The findings of this study are helpful for understanding NDMA formation mechanism and predicting NDMA yield of a precursor.									15	0	0	12	0	15			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000340080600041	24968236

Inkjet printing of living cell-laden bioink is one of the most promising technologies enabling biofabrication, and the bioink printability must be carefully examined for it to be a viable biofabrication technology. In this study, the cell-laden bioink droplet formation process has been studied in terms of the breakup time, droplet size and velocity, and satellite formation using a time-resolved imaging approach. The bioink has been prepared using fibroblasts and sodium alginate with four different cell concentrations: without cells, 1 x 10(6), 5 x 10(6), and 1 x 10(7) cells/mL to appreciate the effect of cell concentration on the droplet formation process. Furthermore, the bioink droplet formation process is compared with that during the inkjetting of a comparable polystyrene microbead-laden suspension under the identical operating conditions to understand the effect of particle physical properties on the droplet formation process. It is found that (1) as the cell concentration of bioink increases, the droplet size and velocity decrease, the formation of satellite droplets is suppressed, and the breakup time increases, and (2) compared to the hard bead-laden suspension, the bioink tends to have a less ejected fluid volume, lower droplet velocity, and longer breakup time.									23	0	0	7	0	23			0743-7463			WOS:000340079200016	25005170

The scope will cover different stamping phases; specifically the stamped part design, the stamping process planning, the die structure planning and manufacturing with the focus on progressive die designs, and lastly, the strip layout planning. The analysis of the KBS in each of these stamping phases will include the intended function of the system, the KBS construction methodology and the reasoning logic scheme utilised to manipulate the content of the knowledge bases. The survey compares the followed approaches in terms of challenges and merits found for each followed approach. This work serves as a current state-of-the-art analysis for employing KBS in sheet metal stamping (SMS).									0	0	0	0	0	0			0951-192X	1362-3052		WOS:000335848400001

J	Bauer, Sarah; Conlon, Meghan; Morris, Meredith								Using Fluorescent Proteins to Monitor Glycosome Dynamics in the African Trypanosome								JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS					90					e51647	10.3791/51647			AUG 2014	2014	Trypanosoma brucei is a kinetoplastid parasite that causes human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), or sleeping sickness, and a wasting disease, nagana, in cattle(1). The parasite alternates between the bloodstream of the mammalian host and the tsetse fly vector. The composition of many cellular organelles changes in response to these different extracellular conditions(2-5).Glycosomes are highly specialized peroxisomes in which many of the enzymes involved in glycolysis are compartmentalized. Glycosome composition changes in a developmental and environmentally regulated manner(4-11). Currently, the most common techniques used to study glycosome dynamics are electron and fluorescence microscopy; techniques that are expensive, time and labor intensive, and not easily adapted to high throughput analyses.To overcome these limitations, a fluorescent-glycosome reporter system in which enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) is fused to a peroxisome targeting sequence (PTS2), which directs the fusion protein to glycosomes(12), has been established. Upon import of the PTS2eYFP fusion protein, glycosomes become fluorescent. Organelle degradation and recycling results in the loss of fluorescence that can be measured by flow cytometry. Large numbers of cells (5,000 cells/sec) can be analyzed in real-time without extensive sample preparation such as fixation and mounting. This method offers a rapid way of detecting changes in organelle composition in response to fluctuating environmental conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1940-087X			WOS:000349299200032	25177828

Nanolaminates used for this study had either 20- or 100-nm-thick alternating layers of Ti and TiN, resulting in a total thickness of similar to 1-mu m films. The structure of the Ti and TiN layers was confirmed using X-ray diffraction [(111)(TiN) and (002)(Ti)], and compositions were determined using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS)-Ti and TiN0.7. Variation of the individual layer thicknesses within Ti/TiN nanolaminates was shown to influence both the deformation observed through the nanolaminate thickness and also the friction coefficient between the nanolaminate and 440C steel counterface during linear reciprocating wear. During sliding, the 100-nm-layered nanolaminate had a lower coefficient of friction (0.25 +/- A 0.01) than the 20-nm-layered nanolaminate (0.56 +/- A 0.06). An amorphous titanium layer developed during sliding at the interface between the 100-nm nanolaminate and steel counterface. EELS confirmed that this layer did not contain any nitrogen and recrystallization occurred near the in-contact surface. While phase changes under compressive loading have been reported for other systems, this is the first report to indicate this response within a titanium layer.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1023-8883	1573-2711		WOS:000338650700002

Autumnal equinox								JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS				119	8						10.1002/2014JA020345			AUG 2014	2014	An ongoing effort to simulate plasma instability in the equatorial ionosphere leading to equatorial spread F (ESF) in the American sector is described. Ionospheric state parameters including plasma number density and vector drift velocity profiles were measured at the Jicamarca Radio Observatory in the period between 20 September and 3 October 2013. Coherent radar backscatter from plasma irregularities was recorded simultaneously, and images of the irregularities were calculated using aperture synthesis methods. Neutral winds were measured by the red line Fabry-Perot interferometers at Jicamarca and Arequipa, Peru. A fully 3-D numerical simulation of ionospheric irregularities, initialized and forced using parameterizations derived from measurements and empirical models, was used to reproduce the ESF activity observed. Simulations were able to recover many of the features of the irregularities, although some important anomalies can be noted. ESF events in which the first appearance of radar plumes occurred either very early or very late were not reproduced in simulation and may be indicative of nonlocal influence.									2	0	0	0	0	2			2169-9380	2169-9402		WOS:000344809600070

Storm time response of the midlatitude thermosphere: Observations from a network of Fabry-Perot interferometers								JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS				119	8						10.1002/2014JA019832			AUG 2014	2014	Observations of thermospheric neutral winds and temperatures obtained during a geomagnetic storm on 2 October 2013 from a network of six Fabry-Perot interferometers (FPIs) deployed in the Midwest United States are presented. Coincident with the commencement of the storm, the apparent horizontal wind is observed to surge westward and southward (toward the equator). Simultaneous to this surge in the apparent horizontal winds, an apparent downward wind of approximately 100 m/s lasting for 6 h is observed. The apparent neutral temperature is observed to increase by approximately 400 K over all of the sites. Observations from an all-sky imaging system operated at the Millstone Hill observatory indicate the presence of a stable auroral red (SAR) arc and diffuse red aurora during this time. We suggest that the large sustained apparent downward winds arise from contamination of the spectral profile of the nominal thermospheric 630.0 nm emission by 630.0 nm emission from a different (nonthermospheric) source. Modeling demonstrates that the effect of an additional population of 630.0 nm photons, with a distinct velocity and temperature distribution, introduces an apparent Doppler shift when the combined emissions from the two sources are analyzed as a single population. Thus, the apparent Doppler shifts should not be interpreted as the bulk motion of the thermosphere, calling into question results from previous FPI studies of midlatitude storm time thermospheric winds. One possible source of contamination could be fast O related to the infusion of low-energy O+ ions from the magnetosphere. The presence of low-energy O+ is supported by observations made by the Helium, Oxygen, Proton, and Electron spectrometer instruments on the twin Van Allen Probes spacecraft, which show an influx of low-energy ions during this period. These results emphasize the importance of distributed networks of instruments in understanding the complex dynamics that occur in the upper atmosphere during disturbed conditions.									7	0	0	0	0	7			2169-9380	2169-9402		WOS:000344809600052

To associate the names rufipes (Meigen) and tomosvaryi with cytological entities, larvae from the respective type localities in Germany were characterized chromosomally. Prosimulium frontatum is restricted to the Caucasus Mountains where studied populations have five unique inversions. It is most closely related to cytoforms 'A' and 'B' of P. rachiliense, the three taxa sharing one unique inversion. The two cytoforms of P. rachiliense are separated by about 1200 km, obscuring decisions about their reproductive isolation. The names rachiliense and possibly pronevitschae Rubtsov apply to cytoform 'A' in Armenia, whereas the name fulvipes (Edwards) might apply to cytoform 'B' in Turkey and to material formerly identified in Turkey as P. rufipes. Populations of P. tomosvaryi in Armenia are chromosomally distinct from previously studied populations in Europe and Morocco, although tied to European and Turkish populations by a shared X-linked inversion. We conservatively view Armenian, European, and Turkish populations of P. tomosvaryi as a single, polymorphic species. A new species, chromosomally related to P. hirtipes (Fries) and P. tomosvaryi by two uniquely shared inversions, was discovered in Turkey.

Using a sample of 234 female auditors employed in public accounting firms, we examine the effects of workgroup composition factors and organizational climate factors on perceived gender discrimination, along with the impact of perceived gender discrimination on several critical organizational outcomes. We find that female auditors report lower levels of gender discrimination when employed (1) in firms with more female partners, (2) in firms with stronger ethical climates, (3) in firms that are more supportive of alternative work arrangements, and (4) in firms that provide higher levels of top management support for the personal well-being of their employees. Further, we find that perceived gender discrimination is associated with lower organizational citizenship behavior and higher turnover intentions. Implications for research and public policy are discussed.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0278-0380	1558-7991		WOS:000343028700001

We found that the sensitivity of a refractometer is linearly proportional to the wavelength of the dip/peak in the transmission spectrum that is chosen to measure the refractive index (RI) change. Because the wavelength shift is larger for a dip/peak at a longer wavelength than at a shorter wavelength, a linear spectral chirp will occur in the transmission spectrum when the surrounding RI changes. We also found that the sensitivity significantly increases with the decrease in the diameter of the NCF and is independent of its length. The experimental results agree well with the numerical predictions.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1943-0655	1943-0647		WOS:000342912700036

In the uni-axial tensile tests, chirality effect of the mechanical properties is negligible at zero strain and becomes significant with the increasing strain, regardless of vacancies. The existence of vacancies decreases the Young's modulus and ultimate strength of the MoS2 structure. During the uni-axial tensile tests, the band gap decreases with the increasing strain, regardless of chirality and vacancies. The band gap is reduced with the intermediate state brought by the existence of vacancies. No chirality effect can be observed on the band gap variations of perfect MoS2. Chirality effect appears to the band gap variation of defected MoS2 due to the local lattice relaxation near the vacancies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

HIM offers a near-molecular resolution (approaching that of TEM) combined with a simplicity of sample preparation and high depth of field similar to SEM. Simultaneously, the technique is not limited by the surface roughness as scanning probe microscopy (SPM) techniques or by the surface charging or radiation damage like SEM. In our review, we consider general principles, advantages, and prospects of HIM application in polymer science. Examples of high-resolution imaging of polymer-based nanocomposites, polymer nanoparticles, nanofibers, nanoporous materials, polymer nanocrystals, biopolymers, and polymer-based photovoltaic and sensor devices are presented.

The bomb's construction being secret at the time but having since been partially declassified, the nuclear tests of the early 1950s provide an opportunity to observe market efficiency through the dissemination of private information as it becomes public. I replicate Alchian's event study of capital market reactions to the Operation Castle series of nuclear detonations in the Marshall Islands, beginning with the Bravo shot on March 1, 1954 at Bikini Atoll which remains the largest nuclear detonation in US history, confirming Alchian's results. The Operation Castle tests pioneered the use of lithium deuteride dry fuel which paved the way for the development of high yield nuclear weapons deliverable by aircraft. I find significant upward movement in the price of Lithium Corp. relative to the other corporations and to DJIA in March 1954; within three weeks of Castle Bravo the stock was up 48% before settling down to a monthly return of 28% despite secrecy, scientific uncertainty, and public confusion surrounding the test; the company saw a return of 461% for the year.

Merr.] putting green performance at The Cliff's Communities Turfgrass Research Facility in Marietta, SC. Factors included four nitrogen (N) fertility rates and two trinexapac-ethyl (TE) regimes. Foliar applications of 0, 4.9, 9.8, and 14.7 kg.ha(-1) N were made once weekly for 7 and 15 weeks in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Trinexapac-ethyl was tank-mixed and applied weekly for 7 weeks during July to August at 0 or 0.017 kg a.i./ha totaling 0.120 kg a.i./ha for both growing seasons. Putting green performance was measured by assessing turf quality (TQ), ball roll distance (BRD), surface firmness (SF), leaf tissue nutrient concentrations, and thatch accumulation. Turfgrasses receiving 4.9 kg N/ha weekly exhibited acceptable TQ and greater SF and BED than plots receiving 14.7 kg N/ha weekly on all rating dates in 2010 before seasonal dormancy. Trinexapac-ethyl reduced clipping yield by 15% to 43% and influenced BED, SF, and tissue nutrient concentration across the 2-year study. Surface firmness decreased as total N input increased during the 2010 growing season and is presumably the result of an increase in leaf tissue causing a cushioned putting surface. Linear regression of thatch accumulation and SF were analyzed and found to be significant at four rating dates in 2010 indicating that as thatch organic matter increased, SF decreased. Nitrogen input for 'Diamond' zoysiagrass putting greens grown in the transition zone should begin at 73.5 kg.ha(-1)/year with supplemental N applications applied as needed.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0018-5345	2327-9834		WOS:000341407100017

Associations Between Reasons for Living and Diminished Suicide Intent Among African-American Female Suicide Attempters								JOURNAL OF NERVOUS AND MENTAL DISEASE				202	8			569	575		10.1097/NMD.0000000000000170			AUG 2014	2014	African-American women are at high risk for suicide ideation and suicide attempts and use emergency psychiatric services at disproportionately high rates relative to men and other ethnic groups. However, suicide death rates are low for this population. Cultural variables in the African-American community may promote resilience and prevent fatal suicidal behavior among African-American women. The present study evaluated self-reported reasons for living as a protective factor against suicidal intent and suicide attempt lethality in a sample of African-American female suicide attempters (n = 150). Regression analyses revealed that reasons for living were negatively associated with suicidal intent, even after controlling for spiritual well-being and symptoms of depression. These results indicate that the ability to generate and contemplate reasons for valuing life may serve as a protective characteristic against life-threatening suicidal behavior among African-American women. Implications for research and clinical practice are further discussed.									2	0	1	0	0	3			0022-3018	1539-736X		WOS:000341502900001	25010106	
J	Kosa, Katherine M.; Cates, Sheryl C.; Hall, Aron J.; Brophy, Jenna E.; Fraser, Angela								Gaps in Food Safety Professionals' Knowledge about Noroviruses								JOURNAL OF FOOD PROTECTION				77	8			1336	1341		10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-13-550			AUG 2014	2014	Noroviruses (NoVs) are the most common etiologic agents of endemic and epidemic foodborne disease in the United States. Food safety professionals play an important role in protecting the public from foodborne illness. A survey of food safety professionals (n = 314) was conducted to characterize their knowledge of NoVs and to identify gaps in this knowledge. To recruit individuals, 25 professional organizations promoted the survey via their Web sites, newsletters, and/or e-mail distribution lists. The survey used true or false and open-ended questions to assess knowledge about NoVs, including attribution, transmission, and prevention and control strategies, including food handling practices. The online survey was available from mid-October 2012 to mid-January 2013. Of the 314 respondents, 66.2% correctly identified NoVs as one of the three most common causes of foodborne disease in the United States. Only 5.4% of respondents correctly identified the three most common settings for NoV infections, and 65.0% of respondents had the misperception that cruise ships are one of the three most common settings. Seventeen respondents (5.4%) answered all 20 true-or-false questions correctly, 33 respondents (10.5%) answered at least 19 of the 20 questions correctly, and 186 respondents (65.0%) answered at least 15 of the 20 questions correctly (i.e., a score of 75% or higher). The. content domain in which respondents had the most incorrect answers was food handling practices. Thirty-eight percent of respondents incorrectly responded that it is safe for restaurant workers infected with NoVs to handle packaged food, food equipment, and utensils. About half of respondents did not know the recommended sanitizing solution for eliminating NoVs from a contaminated surface: The survey findings identified several important gaps in food safety professionals' knowledge of NoVs. The study results will inform the development of a Web-based educational module on NoVs to improve efforts to prevent the spread of NoVs in retail and institutional food establishments.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0362-028X	1944-9097		WOS:000340012400010	25198594

However, they generally lack the high refractive indices of inorganic semiconductors essential for tight optical confinement in planar integrated photonic circuits. Inorganic-organic hybrid photonic systems overcome these limits by combining both types of materials, although such hybrid integration remains challenging given the vastly different properties of the two types of materials. In this paper, a new approach is used to realize inorganic-organic hybrid photonics using chalcogenide glass (ChG) materials. Known as an amorphous semiconductor, the glass possesses high refractive indices, and can be prepared in a thin film form through solution deposition and patterned via direct thermal nanoimprinting, processing methods traditionally exclusive to polymer materials only. Sub-micrometer waveguides, microring resonators, and diffraction gratings fabricated from solution processed (SP) ChG films can be monolithically integrated with organic polymer substrates to create mechanically flexible, high-index-contrast photonic devices. The resonators exhibit a high quality factor (Q-factor) of 80 000 near 1550 nm wavelength. Free-standing, flexible ChG gratings whose diffraction properties can be readily tailored by conformal integration on nonplanar surfaces are also demonstrated.									10	1	0	1	0	11			2195-1071			WOS:000341180400009

THE PERCEPTION OF CREAMINESS IN SOUR CREAM								JOURNAL OF SENSORY STUDIES				29	4			248	257		10.1111/joss.12098			AUG 2014	2014	Creaminess is a consumer attribute that is frequently used to describe sour cream; however, creaminess is difficult to define or describe and is poorly understood because the mechanism or modality(s) for its perception remain uncertain. The objective of this study was to determine what sensory modality, or combination thereof, was responsible for the perception of creaminess in sour cream. Consumers (n = 274 baseline control, n = 100 each modality study) evaluated creaminess and overall liking of 12 samples representing the sensory space of commercial sour creams. Subsequently, in separate sessions, the effect of each sensory modality was evaluated: visual only, stirring, blindfolded stirring, blindfolded tasting, blindfolded tasting with nose clips and tasting with nose clips. An 11-point creaminess rating scale was used to evaluate creaminess perception, and overall liking was evaluated using the 9-point hedonic scale. The effect of session type (modality), panelist and fat content on creaminess and overall liking was evaluated using a mixed-model analysis of variance. Flavor had the greatest impact on creaminess perception (P < 0.05) followed by visual assessment of sour cream while stirring. Creaminess perception of sour cream is assessed by an olfaction-related mechanism and also by flow characteristics while stirring.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0887-8250	1745-459X		WOS:000340685000003

The strong transverse scattering from the transversely disordered optical fibers results in transversely confined beams that can freely propagate in the longitudinal direction, similar to conventional optical fibers, with the advantage that any point in the cross section of the fiber can be used for beam transport. For beam multiplexing and imaging applications, it is highly desirable to make the localized beam radius as small as possible. This requires large refractive index differences between the materials that define the random features in the disordered fiber. Here, disordered glass-air fibers are briefly reviewed, where randomly placed airholes in a glass matrix provide the sufficiently large refractive index difference of 0.5 for strong random transverse scattering. The main future challenge for the fabrication of an optimally disordered glass-air fibers is to increase the fill-fraction of airholes to nearly 50% for maximum beam confinement.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1996-1944			WOS:000341210400007

Recently, nano-graphene (nGr) has been investigated as a possible platform for biomedical applications. Here, a polymer-coated nGr to deliver drugs to glioblastoma after systemic administration is reported. A biodegradable, biocompatible poly(lactide) (PLA) coating enables encapsulation and controlled release of the hydrophobic anticancer drug paclitaxel (PTX), and a hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) shell increases the solubility of the nGr drug delivery system. Importantly, the polymer coating mediates the interaction of nGr with U-138 glioblastoma cells and decreases cytotoxicity compared with pristine untreated nGr. PLA-PEG-coated nGr is also able to encapsulate PTX at 4.15 wt% and sustains prolonged PTX release for at least 19 d. PTX-loaded nGr-PLA-PEGs are shown to kill up to 20% of U-138 glioblastoma cells in vitro. Furthermore, nGr-PLA-PEG and CNT-PLA-PEG, two carbon nanomaterials with different shapes, are able to kill U-138 in vitro as well as free PTX at significantly lower doses of drug. Finally, in vivo biodistribution of nGr-PLA-PEG shows accumulation of nGr in intracranial U-138 glioblastoma xenografts and organs of the reticuloendothelial system.									7	0	0	3	0	7			0934-0866	1521-4117		WOS:000340901800009

Unfortunately, environmental agencies in developing countries face difficulties in gathering data directly from the creators of such wastes. It is possible, however, to construct theoretical HW inventories using the waste generation factors (WGFs). The objective of this study was to develop a complete nationwide HW inventory of Turkey that relies on nation-specific WGFs to support management activities of the Turkish Ministry of Environment and Urbanization (MoEU). Inventory studies relied on WGFs from: (a) the literature and (b) field studies and analysis of waste declarations reflecting country-specific industrial practices. Moreover, new tools were introduced to the monitoring infrastructure of MoEU to obtain a comprehensive waste generation data set. Through field studies and a consideration of country specific conditions, it was possible to more thoroughly elucidate HW generation trends in Turkey, a method that was deemed superior to other alternatives. Declaration and literature based WGFs also proved most helpful in supplementing field observations that could not always be conducted. It was determined that these theoretical inventories could become valuable assets in supporting regulating agencies in developing countries for a more thorough implementation of HW management systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0734-242X	1096-3669		WOS:000341183800010	25069454

We demonstrate here a novel one-pot synthesis of gold nanoparticles by laser ablation of gold strip and in-situ decoration on graphene substrate. Not only the impregnation of nanoparticles was linker free, but also the synthesis by itself was surfactant-free. The composite materials were well characterized morphologically and functionally using electron microscopy, Xray and electron diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, Zeta potential, electrochemical measurements and UV-Visible spectroscopic techniques. This linker-free gold-graphene based composite has been employed for catalytic applications pertaining to electrooxidation. We have explored the use of this composite as a binder-free electrode in electrocatalytic oxidation of methanol and ethanol in alkaline medium. Additionally, the onset potential for ethanol oxidation was found to be more negative, -100 mV, an indication of its promising application in direct ethanol fuel cells.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1040-0397	1521-4109		WOS:000340557700025

This paper presents results from an experimental investigation of hysteresis in residual trapping and relative permeability of CO2 in a CO2/water system at 50 degrees C and 9 MPa in a Berea sandstone core. Carbon dioxide saturation data were collected using the steady-state method in a horizontal core-flooding apparatus with X-ray computed tomography. Three flooding cycles were completed at a constant total volumetric flow rate by incrementally increasing and decreasing the fractional flow rates of supercritical CO2 and water. The fractional flow rates were chosen such that the maximum CO2 saturation of each cycle was greater than that of the previous cycle. During the injection stage of a cycle, CO2 displaced water in a wetting-phase drainage process (water saturation decrease). Following injection, water displaced CO2 in a wetting-phase imbibition process (water saturation increase). The fractional flow of CO2 was then increased during the next cycle. Results showed the CO2 saturations trapped during wetting-phase imbibition increased with the maximum CO2 saturations reached during each cycle. The residually trapped CO2 saturation is a hysteretic function, depending on the maximum saturation reached by the core before imbibition. A linear model with coefficient 0.5 describes the nonwetting trapping relationship. The experimental relative permeability data for CO2 fit a single bounding primary drainage curve while CO2 saturations increased, but followed three different scanning curves during wetting-phase imbibition. The CO2 relative permeability data can be fit by making a minor modification in the Van Genuchten-Burdine relative permeability data to account for hysteresis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

In the South Carolina Lower Coastal Plain, low-relief topography and a shallow water table make stream channelization ubiquitous. To quantify the impacts of urbanization and stream channelization, we measured flow and sediment from an urbanizing watershed and a small forested watershed. Flow and sediment export rates were used to infer specific yields from forested and nonforested regions of the urbanizing watershed. Study objectives were to: (1) quantify the range of runoff-to-rainfall ratios; (2) quantify the range of specific sediment yields; (3) characterize the quantity and quality of particulate matter exported; and (4) estimate sediment yield attributable to agriculture, development, and channelization activities in the urbanizing watershed. Our results showed that the urban watershed exported over five times more sediment per unit area compared with the forested watershed. Sediment concentration was related to flow flashiness in the urban watershed and to flow magnitude in the forested watershed. Sediments from the forested watershed were dominated by organic matter, whereas mineral matter dominated sediment from the urban stream. Our results indicated that a significant shift in sediment quality and quantity are likely to occur as forested watersheds are transformed by urbanization in coastal South Carolina.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1093-474X	1752-1688		WOS:000340464800009

On estimating the effective nonlinearity of structural modes using approximate modal shapes								JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND CONTROL				20	11			1751	1764		10.1177/1077546313476725			AUG 2014	2014	We investigate the validity and accuracy of using assumed modes methods to estimate the effective nonlinearities of vibration modes. For this purpose, a problem concerning the nonlinear response of a linearly tapered cantilever beam is considered. Since, in the selected example, the linear eigenvalue problem cannot be solved analytically for the exact mode shapes, an approximate set is required to discretize the partial differential equation governing the beam's motion. To approximate the mode shapes, three methods are utilized: (i) a crude approach, which directly utilizes the linear mode shapes of a regular (untapered) cantilever beam; (ii) a finite-element approach wherein the mode shapes are obtained in ANSYS, then fitted into orthonormal polynomial curves while minimizing the least square error in the modal frequencies; and (iii) a Rayleigh-Ritz approach which utilizes a set of orthonormal trial basis functions to construct the mode shapes as a linear combination of the trial functions used. Upon discretization, the modal frequencies, the geometric and inertia nonlinearity coefficients, as well as the effective nonlinearities of the first three vibration modes are compared for eight beams with different tapering. It is shown that, even when the modal frequencies are well-approximated using the three methods, a large discrepancy is observed among the estimates of the inertia, geometric and, thereby, effective nonlinearities of the structural modes. In fact, when using the modal frequencies as a convergence measure for assumed modes methods, inaccurate, and sometimes, erroneous predictions of the effective nonlinearities can be obtained. As a result, this paper recommends that a stricter measure based on the convergence of the nonlinear coefficients be implemented for discretizing a nonlinear system using approximate mode shapes.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1077-5463	1741-2986		WOS:000340259200013

Multivalent amino sugars to recognize different TAR RNA conformations								MEDCHEMCOMM				5	8			1235	1246		10.1039/c4md00165f			AUG 2014	2014	Neomycin dimers synthesized using "click chemistry" with varying functionality and length in the linker region have been shown to be effective in targeting the HIV-1 transactivation response element (TAR) RNA region of the HIV virus. TAR, a 59 base pair stem loop structure located at the 5'-end of all nascent viral transcripts interacts with its target, a key regulatory protein, Tat, and necessitates the replication of HIV-1 virus. Ethidium bromide displacement and FRET competition assays have revealed nanomolar binding affinity between neomycin dimers and wildtype TAR RNA while in case of neomycin, only a weak binding was detected. Here, NMR and FID-based comparisons reveal an extended binding interface for neomycin dimers involving the upper stem of the TAR RNA thereby offering an explanation for increased affinities. To further explore the potential of these modified aminosugars we have extended binding studies to include four TAR RNA mutants that display conformational differences with minimal sequence variation. The differences in binding between neomycin and neomycin dimers is characterized with TAR RNA mutants that include mutations to the bulge region, hairpin region, and both the bulge and hairpin regions. Our results demonstrate the effect of these mutations on neomycin binding and our results show that linker functionalities between dimeric units of neomycin can distinguish between the conformational differences of mutant TAR RNA structures,									1	0	0	0	0	1			2040-2503	2040-2511		WOS:000340353500027	27076899

Several microscopic techniques were utilized, including micro-Raman spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selective area diffraction (SAD). In an effort to examine the variation in uptake due to surface properties, four groups of differently functionalized SWCNTs were used: hydroxylated (OH-SWCNTs), silicon dioxide (SiO2-SWCNTs), poly aminobenzenesulfonic acid (PABS-SWCNTs) and polyethylene glycol (PEG-SWCNTs). Raman spectroscopy was able to detect OH-SWCNTs within the gut, but lacked the spatial resolution that is needed to identify lower concentrations of SWCNTs that may have been absorbed by body tissues. Initially, low-magnification imaging of exposed D. magna sections in the TEM revealed several features, which suggested absorption of SWCNTs. However, subsequent analysis with additional techniques (HRTEM, X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy and SAD) indicated that these features were either artifacts produced via the specimen staining process or consisted of non-graphitic, organic structures. This latter observation emphasizes the inherent difficulty in resolving SWCNTs embedded within a complex, organic matrix, as well as the care with which imaging results must be interpreted and supplemented with other, more analytical techniques.									23	0	0	18	0	23			1743-5390	1743-5404		WOS:000340524300001	24350828

In general, hydrometric networks have been designed without paying particular attention to the effect of seasonal streamflow information (SSI) at gauging stations on the efficiency of the hydrometric networks. This paper evaluates the effect of SSI on streamflow networks based on nonparametric implementation of entropy theory using the kernel density approach for estimating the mutual information between gauging stations on a seasonal basis. Overall, it is shown that the SSI of individual stations is season dependent and the efficiency of the streamflow network is also season dependent, therefore the effect of seasonality should be incorporated in future hydrometric network design. This methodology was applied at five river basins in Canada and its role for network design is discussed.

J	Murphy, P.; Kaye, N. B.; Khan, A. A.								Hydraulic Performance of Aggregate Beds with Perforated Pipe Underdrains Flowing Full								JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING				140	8						10.1061/(ASCE)IR.1943-4774.0000740			AUG 2014	2014	Results are presented from an experimental study of the stage discharge relationship for a porous pipe buried under loose laid aggregate. A series of steady-state experiments were performed in which the depth of flow over the pipe was measured for a given pipe discharge. The stage-discharge relationship for the entire system is well described by an orifice equation when the water surface in the aggregate trench was horizontal and the pipe was running full at the outlet. An energy equation analysis shows that the dominant energy losses are due to flow through the small side wall orifices into the pipe and from friction losses along the pipe. Friction losses in the aggregate are shown to be negligible, which again supports the orifice equation model. Discharge coefficients are reported for three commonly available porous pipes. The results of this research can be used in the sizing and placement of subsurface drains in aggregate filled storm water infiltration practices such as infiltration trenches and porous pavements.

J	Ledbetter, Andrew M.; Mazer, Joseph P.								Do online communication attitudes mitigate the association between Facebook use and relational interdependence? An extension of media multiplexity theory								NEW MEDIA & SOCIETY				16	5			806	822		10.1177/1461444813495159			AUG 2014	2014	Given Facebook's popularity for the maintenance of interpersonal relationships, this investigation examined the extent to which frequency of Facebook communication with a specific friend predicts relational interdependence. The chief goal of the investigation was to extend media multiplexity theory by examining whether attitudes toward (a) online self-disclosure and (b) online social connection moderated this association. Results not only replicated previous findings that multiple media are associated with relational interdependence, but also supported the hypothesized moderation of online communication attitude. Based on these results, the manuscript explores how media multiplexity theory might be extended to account for communicator cognitions about communication media.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1461-4448	1461-7315		WOS:000340197900007

Previous studies have suggested that anadromous fish use olfactory cues to perform successful migration to spawn. However, limited genomic information is available for C. nasus. To understand the molecular mechanisms of spawning migration, it is essential to identify the genes and pathways involved in the migratory behavior of C. nasus.Results: Using de novo transcriptome sequencing and assembly, we constructed two transcriptomes of the olfactory epithelium from wild anadromous and non-anadromous C. nasus. Over 178 million high-quality clean reads were generated using Illumina sequencing technology and assembled into 176,510 unigenes (mean length: 843 bp). About 51% (89,456) of the unigenes were functionally annotated using protein databases. Gene ontology analysis of the transcriptomes indicated gene enrichment not only in signal detection and transduction, but also in regulation and enzymatic activity. The potential genes and pathways involved in the migratory behavior were identified. In addition, simple sequence repeats and single nucleotide polymorphisms were analyzed to identify potential molecular markers.Conclusion: We, for the first time, obtained high-quality de novo transcriptomes of C. nasus using a high-throughput sequencing approach. Our study lays the foundation for further investigation of C. nasus spawning migration and genome evolution.									5	2	0	5	0	7			1932-6203			WOS:000339819800085	25084282

A novel protocol allowing oral delivery of a protein complement inhibitor that subsequently targets to inflamed colon mucosa and ameliorates murine colitis								CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL IMMUNOLOGY				177	2			500	508		10.1111/cei.12350			AUG 2014	2014	While there is evidence of a pathogenic role for complement in inflammatory bowel disease, there is also evidence for a protective role that relates to host defence and protection from endotoxaemia. There is thus concern regarding the use of systemic complement inhibition as a therapeutic strategy. Local delivery of a complement inhibitor to the colon by oral administration would ameliorate such concerns, but while formulations exist for oral delivery of low molecular weight drugs to the colon, they have not been used successfully for oral delivery of proteins. We describe a novel pellet formulation consisting of cross-linked dextran coated with an acrylic co-polymer that protects the complement inhibitor CR2-Crry from destruction in the gastrointestinal tract. CR2-Crry containing pellets administered by gavage, were characterized using a therapeutic protocol in a mouse model of dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Oral treatment of established colitis over a 5-day period significantly reduced mucosal inflammation and injury, with similar therapeutic benefit whether or not the proton pump inhibitor, omeprazole, was co-administered. Reduction in injury was associated with the targeting of CR2-Crry to the mucosal surface and reduced local complement activation. Treatment had no effect on systemic complement activity. This novel method for oral delivery of a targeted protein complement inhibitor will reduce systemic effects, thereby decreasing the risk of opportunistic infection, as well as lowering the required dose and treatment cost and improving patient compliance. Furthermore, the novel delivery system described here may provide similar benefits for administration of other protein-based drugs, such as anti-tumour necrosis factor-a antibodies.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0009-9104	1365-2249		WOS:000339480700014	24730624

In the course of studying how graduate students learn to solve organic synthesis problems, we were able to identify some of the key factors in the epistemic development from student to practitioner. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with four first-year organic chemistry graduate students enrolled in a course on organic synthesis and two third-year organic chemistry graduate students who were in the process of preparing an original research proposal in organic synthesis as a component of their Ph.D. oral qualifying exams. Three interconnected factors that fostered the students' development into practicing organic chemists were identified: (1) the students needed to perceive the material they were asked to learn in the course lectures and in other interactions with the professor as "real;" (2) they needed to work on authentic activities that provided concrete instruments for knowledge construction; and (3) the students needed scaffolding with a more-knowledgeable other in the form of feedback on the authentic activity.

In 2012 and 2013, three novae were detected in gamma rays and stood in contrast to the first gamma-ray-detected nova V407 Cygni 2010, which belongs to a rare class of symbiotic binary systems. Despite likely differences in the compositions and masses of their white dwarf progenitors, the three classical novae are similarly characterized as soft-spectrum transient gamma-ray sources detected over 2- to 3-week durations. The gamma-ray detections point to unexpected high-energy particle acceleration processes linked to the mass ejection from thermonuclear explosions in an unanticipated class of Galactic gamma-ray sources.									33	1	0	1	0	34			0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000339651300043

Populations of B. cinerea tended to have a single dominant, location-specific resistance profile that consisted of resistance to multiple fungicides in fields sprayed weekly with site-specific fungicides. The most prevalent profile in blackberry fields consisted of resistance to thiophanate-methyl, pyraclostrobin, and boscalid. The most prevalent resistance profile found in conventional strawberry fields consisted of resistance to thiophanate-methyl, pyraclostrobin, boscalid, and cyprodinil. A statistical model revealed that multifungicide resistance patterns did not evolve randomly in populations from both crops. Instead, strains resistant to thiophanate-methyl were more likely to acquire resistance to pyraclostrobin, the resulting dual-resistant population was more likely to acquire resistance to boscalid, the resulting triple-resistant population was more likely to acquire resistance to cyprodinil, and the resulting quadruple-resistant population was more likely to acquire resistance to fenhexamid (strawberry population only) compared with random chance. Resistance to iprodione and fludioxonil evolved from a pool of strains with different fungicide resistance profiles. Resistance to thiophanate-methyl, pyraclostrobin, boscalid, and fenhexamid in blackberry isolates was, without exception, based on target gene mutations, including E198A and E198V in beta-tubulin, G143A in cytochrome b, H272Y and H272R in SdhB, and F4121 in Erg27, respectively. A new genotype associated with fenhexamid resistance was found in one strain (i.e., Y408H and deletion of P298). Fungicide-resistant strains were present but rare in an unsprayed blackberry field, where some unique phenotypes, including low and medium resistance to fludioxonil, had emerged in the absence of fungicide pressure. The isolates resistant to fludioxonil had effective dose that inhibited 50% of mycelial growth values of 0.16 mu g/ml (low resistance) and 0.32 and 0.38 mu g/ml (medium resistance) and were also resistant to the anilinopyrimidine fungicide cyprodinil, indicating that this and similar phenotypes will eventually be selected by continued applications of the fludioxonil + cyprodinil premixture Switch. This study shows that multifungicide-resistant phenotypes are common in conventionally maintained strawberry and blackberry fields and that resistance to multiple fungicides evolved from stepwise accumulation of single resistances.									13	0	0	10	0	13			0191-2917	1943-7692		WOS:000339365400006

Considering an aggressive drive cycle and a state-of-charge regulation strategy as a benchmark, the frequency-based strategy yields 5.9% increase in fuel economy, 62.7% decrease in soot emissions, and 23% reduction in effective Amp-hours processed, which should yield an increase in battery life.

Each solution was evaluated according to several metrics, comprising of energy and fuel economy on two driving profiles unknown to the participants, acceleration and braking performance, computational performance. The nine solutions received are analyzed in terms of the control technique adopted (heuristic rule-based energy management vs. equivalent consumption minimization strategies, ECMS), battery discharge strategy (charge depleting-charge sustaining vs. blended mode), ECMS implementation (vector-based vs. map-based), ways to improve the implementation and improve the computational performance.

Invited review: Palmitic and stearic acid metabolism in lactating dairy cows								JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE				97	8			4661	4674		10.3168/jds.2014-7919			AUG 2014	2014	Energy is the most limiting nutritional component in diets for high-producing dairy cows. Palmitic (C16:0) and stearic (C18:0) acids have unique and specific functions in lactating dairy cows beyond a ubiquitous energy source. This review delineates their metabolism and usage in lactating dairy cows from diet to milk production. Palmitic acid is the fatty acid (FA) found in the greatest quantity in milk fat. Dietary sources of C16:0 generally increase milk fat yield and are used as an energy source for milk production and replenishing body weight loss during periods of negative energy balance. Stearic acid is the most abundant FA available to the dairy cow and is used to a greater extent for milk production and energy balance than C16:0. However, C18:0 is also intimately involved in milk fat production. Quantifying the transfer of each FA from diet into milk fat is complicated by de novo synthesis of C16:0 and desaturation of C18:0 to oleic acid in the mammary gland. In addition, incorporation of both FA into milk fat appears to be limited by the cow's requirement to maintain fluidity of milk, which requires a balance between saturated and unsaturated FA. Oleic acid is the second most abundant FA in milk fat and likely the main unsaturated FA involved in regulating fluidity of milk. Because the mammary gland can desaturate C18:0 to oleic acid, C18:0 appears to have a more prominent role in milk production than C16:0. To understand metabolism and utilization of these FA in lactating dairy cows, we reviewed production and milk fat synthesis studies. Additional and longer lactation studies on feeding both FA to lactating dairy cows are required to better delineate their roles in optimizing milk production and milk FA composition and yield.									11	0	1	11	1	12			0022-0302	1525-3198		WOS:000338913300001	24913651

We hypothesized that chemical stabilization of acellular xenogenic arteries would generate off-the-shelf grafts resistant to thrombosis, dilatation and calcification. To test this hypothesis, we decellularized porcine renal arteries, stabilized elastin with penta-galloyl glucose and collagen with carbodiimide/activated heparin and implanted them as transposition grafts in the abdominal aorta of rats as direct implants and separately as indirect, isolation-loop implants. All implants resulted in high patency and animal survival rates, ubiquitous encapsulation within a vascularized collagenous capsule, and exhibited lack of lumen thrombogenicity and no graft wall calcification. Peri-anastomotic neo-intimal tissue overgrowth was a normal occurrence in direct implants; however this reaction was circumvented in indirect implants. Notably, implantation of non-treated control scaffolds exhibited marked graft dilatation and elastin degeneration; however PGG significantly reduced elastin degradation and prevented aneurismal dilatation of vascular grafts. Overall these results point to the outstanding potential of crosslinked arterial scaffolds as small diameter vascular grafts.

The biomass concentrations of the old and the new C. protothecoides strains on day 6 reached 14.07 and 12.73 g/L, respectively, which were comparable to those in basal medium with supplement of glucose and yeast extract (BM-GY) (14.47 g/L for old strains and 11.43 g/L for new strains) (P > 0.05). Approximately 81.5% of total organic carbon and 65.1% of total nitrogen in the mixed waste were effectively removed. The accumulated lipid productivities of the old and the new C. protothecoides strains in BM-GY were 2.07 and 1.61 g/L/day, respectively, whereas in the mixed waste, lipid productivities could reach 2.12 and 1.81 g/L/day, respectively. Our result highlights a new approach of mixing carbon-rich and nitrogen-rich wastes as economical and practical alternative substrates for biofuel production. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, changes in precipitation could alter the sensitivity of litter decomposition to warming, thereby affecting the formation of litter-derived soil organic matter. As grassland soils store similar to 20% of Earth's soil carbon, understanding the effect of climatic changes on the decomposition dynamics of grasses is important. However, little is known about how projected changes in climate would affect litter microbial communities and enzyme activities, and the consequences of these changes for the mass loss and compound-specific degradation of grass litter that possess complex lignocellulosic chemistry. Over a period of two years, using litter of the grass Poa trivialis, we studied how mass loss, microbial enzyme activity and fine-level litter chemistry responded to a factorial combination of 4 levels of warming (up to ambient + similar to 4 degrees C) and three levels of precipitation [ambient, wet (+50%) and dry (-50%)] at the Boston-Area Climate Experiment (BACE), in Massachusetts, USA. After 393 days of decomposition, supplemental precipitation accelerated mass loss compared to the dry treatment, as a consequence of faster loss of hydroxycinnamates, which protect carbohydrates through cross-linkages with lignins. Only a third as much of the cell wall-bound ferulic and p-coumaric acids remained in litter from the supplemental precipitation treatment compared to the ambient controls. In contrast, the warming treatments did not affect mass loss until later, after 740 days, when the litter in the warmest treatment (+similar to 4 degrees C) had lost the most mass. Although warming significantly affected mass loss after 740 days, there was also a trend in the warmest treatments toward greater mass loss in the wet (78% mass loss) and ambient (68%) plots compared to dry plots (61%), possibly due to the higher activity of beta-glucosidase. Though mass loss at this final time point varied with both warming and precipitation treatments, the compound-specific degradation of litter captured by diffuse reflectance infra-red Fourier transform (DRIFT) and C-13 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy revealed that only the precipitation treatments significantly altered the chemistry of carbon compounds in the decomposed tissue. Litter that decomposed in the dry treatment had a higher proportion of carbohydrates remaining than litter in the wet and ambient treatments. Similarly, although ergosterol content and potential activity of phenol oxidase decreased in the warmer treatments, the consequences of this response were not observed in the degradation of specific compounds in litter, which varied only with precipitation treatments. Our results suggests that mass loss and enzyme activities may not accurately capture the complexity of compound-specific degradation of litter during decomposition. Our results also identified non-linear responses of beta-glucosidase and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) activities to warming. These results thus emphasize the complexities of litter decomposition and suggest that similar changes in decomposition across other grass species could alter the carbon budget of grasslands.

While previous computational studies have attempted to model Fontan exercise, they did not fully account for global physiologic mechanisms nor directly compare results against clinical and physiologic data. Methods: In this study, we developed a protocol to simulate Fontan lower-body exercise using a closed-loop lumped-parameter model describing the entire circulation. We analyzed clinical exercise data from a cohort of Fontan patients, incorporated previous clinical findings from literature, quantified a comprehensive list of physiological changes during exercise, translated them into a computational model of the Fontan circulation, and designed a general protocol to model Fontan exercise behavior. Using inputs of patient weight, height, and if available, patient-specific reference heart rate (HR) and oxygen consumption, this protocol enables the derivation of a full set of parameters necessary to model a typical Fontan patient of a given body-size over a range of physiologic exercise levels. Results: In light of previous literature data and clinical knowledge, the model successfully produced realistic trends in physiological parameters with exercise level. Applying this method retrospectively to a set of clinical Fontan exercise data, direct comparison between simulation results and clinical data demonstrated that the model successfully reproduced the average exercise response of a cohort of typical Fontan patients. Conclusion: This work is intended to offer a foundation for future advances in modeling Fontan exercise, highlight the needs in clinical data collection, and provide clinicians with quantitative reference exercise physiologies for Fontan patients.									4	0	0	2	0	4			0148-0731	1528-8951		WOS:000338507000007

Little information is available on DBP levels, sources, and health risks in marine mammal aquaria. Using the commonly observed trihalomethanes (THMs) as a DBP indicator, we monitored concentrations for seven months at The Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito, California, one of the largest pinniped rehabilitation facilities in the world. Concentrations of THMs ranged 1.1-144.2 mu g/L in pool waters and generally increased with number of animals housed (P < 0.05). To identify the sources of THM precursors in marine mammal aquaria, we intensively monitored the mass flows of potential THM precursors (i.e. food and wastes) in an isolated system with nine individual California sea lions to evaluate the sources and reactivity of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) for 2-5 weeks. The common frozen foods used in feeding pinnipeds, including herring, sardine, and squid, produced an average of 22-34 mg-DOC/g-food in water and 836-1066 mu g-THW g-food after chlorination, whereas the fecal materials, including fresh scat, decomposed scat, and urine, produced 2-16 mg-DOC/g-waste and 116-768 mu g-THM/g-waste. Food not eaten by animals could cause a sharp increase of DOC and DBP production and therefore should be removed rapidly from pools. Marine mammal husbandry staff and trainers are at risk (5.16 x 10(-4) to 1.30 x 10(-3)) through exposure of THMs, exceeding the negligible risk level (10(-6)) defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency.

The resulting core shell nanoparticles were used as optical labels for cell analysis using flow cytometly and microscopy. The excitation of plasmon resonances in nanoparticles results in strong depolarized scattering of visible light, permitting detection at the single nanoparticle level. The nanoparticles were modified with neutravidin via epoxide azide coupling chemistry, to which biotinylated antibodies targeting cell surface receptors were bound. The nanoparticle labels exhibited long-term stability in solutions with high salt concentrations without aggregation or silver etching. Labeled cells exhibited two orders of magnitude enhancement of the scattering intensity compared with unlabeled cells. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Using atomistic simulations, we found that the interfacial thermal conductance depends strongly on the mode of heat transfer at graphene-matrix interfaces: if heat enters graphene from one side of its basal plane and immediately leaves it through the other side, the corresponding interfacial thermal conductance, G(across), is large; if heat enters graphene from both sides of its basal plane and leaves it at a position far away on its basal plane, the corresponding interfacial thermal conductance, G(non-across), is small. For a single-layer graphene immersed in liquid octane, Gacross is similar to 150 MW/m(2)K while G(non-across) is similar to 5 MW/(MK)-K-2. G(across) decreases with increasing multi-layer graphene thickness (i.e., number of layers in graphene) and approaches an asymptotic value of 100 MW/m(2)K for 7-layer graphenes. G(non-across) increases only marginally as the graphene sheet thickness increases. Such a duality of the interface thermal conductance for different probing methods and its dependence on graphene sheet thickness can be traced ultimately to the unique physical and chemical structure of graphene materials. The ramifications of these results in areas such as the optimal design of graphene-based thermal nanocomposites are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The red shift of lambda(max) occurred to Pv after the conjugation reaction from 355 to 362 nm and from 510 to 520 nm of intrinsic and extrinsic fluorescence emission spectra respectively. Circular dichroism spectra demonstrated that partial unordered secondary structure of Pv transformed into alpha-helix and beta-turn after conjugating with Dex. The solubility of Pv-Dex conjugates represented an increase from 53.0% to 79.3% at pH 4.0. The zeta-potential of all tested emulsions decreased with lowering pH from 7.0 to 4.0. The interfacial thickness of Pv (1.0 mg/ml) absorbed onto latex particles at pH 4.0 was prominently increased by conjugation with Dex. Both the highest ESI and the slight fluctuation of D[4,3] of Pv-Dex conjugates illustrated that conjugation of Pv with Dex would be an effective method to improve its emulsion stability against more acidic pH environment.

The influence of BLD on the gelatinized wheat and waxy rice starch retrogradation was characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WXRD). DSC and WXRD results showed that retrogradation of wheat and waxy rice starch gels were reduced with the addition of branched limit dextrins (F-75 and F-88). Avrami equation was used to analyze the enthalpies of retrograde wheat starch gels, and the value of k indicated that F-75 and F-88 reduced the kinetics of starch retrogradation. In addition, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation was adapted to predict the interaction of BLD and starch fraction, and the results showed that the BLD reduced starch retrogradation by the interplay between starch and BLD.

Thus, the framework can be applied to arbitrary finite volume methods. It also provides the proper functional settings to address well-posedness issues for the primal and adjoint problems. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the validity and effectiveness of the a posteriori error estimates and their applicability to adaptive mesh refinement. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

MOFs are porous, crystalline materials with large surface areas, which are promising for a variety of adsorption applications. We review our simulations of gas uptake in PCN-53 (porous coordination network) as well as gas storage in MOFs functionalised with metal alkoxide sites. While fluid-solid interactions in both systems can be modelled quite well using algebraic force fields, the alkoxide sites in the functionalised MOFs require specialised versions, in order to describe the stronger adsorption energies. We discuss grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations of both systems. Pt is a common catalyst, and simulations have proven quite useful for providing molecular level details to understand its functionality. This involves understanding adsorption phenomena, which often requires quantum mechanical calculations. We describe our periodic boundary condition density functional theory (DFT) simulations of Pt-catalysed NO oxidation, focusing on adsorbate geometries and coverage effects. Finally, we describe one of the current grand challenges' in molecular simulations of adsorption, modelling catalytic activity in aqueous phase, which requires a combination of algebraic force fields, DFT and GCMC.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0892-7022	1029-0435		WOS:000330685300014

Biofilms contaminate many man-made aquatic systems such as cooling towers, spas and dental lines. Within these biofilms, Legionella pneumophila is a primary pathogen, leading to these environments serving as sources for disease outbreaks. Here we show a reduction in biofilm bio-volume upon treatment with citrate-coated 6-nm platinum NPs, polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated 11-nm gold NPs, and PEG-coated 8-nm iron oxide NPs. Treatment with citrate-coated 8-nm silver NPs, however, did not reduce biomass.

Primitive bird tails underwent significant alteration, most notably reduction of the number of caudal vertebrae and fusion of the distal caudal vertebrae into an ossified pygostyle. These changes, among others, occurred over a very short evolutionary interval, which brings into focus the underlying mechanisms behind those changes. Despite the wealth of studies delving into avian evolution, virtually nothing is understood about the genetic and developmental events responsible for the emergence of short, fused tails. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of the signaling pathways and morphological events that contribute to tail extension and termination and examine how mutations affecting the genes that control these pathways might influence the evolution of the avian tail. To generate a list of candidate genes that may have been modulated in the transition to short-tailed birds, we analyzed a comprehensive set of mouse mutants. Interestingly, a prevalent pleiotropic effect of mutations that cause fused caudal vertebral bodies (as in the pygostyles of birds) is tail truncation. We identified 23 mutations in this class, and these were primarily restricted to genes involved in axial extension. At least half of the mutations that cause short, fused tails lie in the Notch/Wnt pathway of somite boundary formation or differentiation, leading to changes in somite number or size. Several of the mutations also cause additional bone fusions in the trunk skeleton, reminiscent of those observed in primitive and modern birds. All of our findings were correlated to the fossil record. An open question is whether the relatively sudden appearance of short-tailed birds in the fossil record could be accounted for, at least in part, by the pleiotropic effects generated by a relatively small number of mutational events.									5	0	0	3	0	5			2041-9139			WOS:000344191100001	25621146

Current SCOWL designs have limited electrical-optical power conversion efficiency (PCE) around 40%, which is lower than conventional RWG laser and broad area laser that are known to have much higher PCEs. To improve the SCOWL PCE, we theoretically optimize its structure by reducing Al content, increasing doping concentration and introducing a GRIN layer to prevent carrier leakage. Numerical simulations predict that an optimized SCOWL design has a maximum PCE of about 57% at room temperature.

The concept is demonstrated using cascaded weak optical reflectors along a single optical fiber, where any two arbitrary reflectors are paired to define a low-finesse Fabry-Perot interferometer. While spatially continuous (i.e., no dark zone), fully distributed strain measurement was used as an example to demonstrate the capability, the proposed concept may also be implemented on other types of waveguide or free-space interferometers and used for distributed measurement of various physical, chemical and biological quantities.

Under relatively small charging currents, the evolution of cell potential from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations during charging can be suitably predicted by the Landau-Ginzburg-type continuum model proposed recently (Bazant et al 2011 Phys. Rev. Lett. 106 046102). Under very large charging currents, the cell potential from MD simulations shows pronounced oscillation during the initial stage of charging, a feature not captured by the continuum model. Such oscillation originates from the sequential growth of the ionic space charge layers near the electrode surface. This allows the evolution of EDLs in RTILs with time, an atomistic process difficult to visualize experimentally, to be studied by analyzing the cell potential under constant-current charging conditions. While the continuum model cannot predict the potential oscillation under such far-from-equilibrium charging conditions, it can nevertheless qualitatively capture the growth of cell potential during the later stage of charging. Improving the continuum model by introducing frequency-dependent dielectric constant and density-dependent ion diffusion coefficients may help to further extend the applicability of the model. The evolution of ion density profiles is also compared between the MD and the continuum model, showing good agreement.									10	0	0	0	0	10			0953-8984	1361-648X		WOS:000338830300010	24919471	
J	Ge, Ting; Robbins, Mark O.; Perahia, Dvora; Grest, Gary S.								Healing of polymer interfaces: Interfacial dynamics, entanglements, and strength								PHYSICAL REVIEW E				90	1					012602	10.1103/PhysRevE.90.012602			JUL 25 2014	2014	Self-healing of polymer films often takes place as the molecules diffuse across a damaged region, above their melting temperature. Using molecular dynamics simulations we probe the healing of polymer films and compare the results with those obtained for thermal welding of homopolymer slabs. These two processes differ from each other in their interfacial structure since damage leads to increased polydispersity and more short chains. A polymer sample was cut into two separate films that were then held together in the melt state. The recovery of the damaged film was followed as time elapsed and polymer molecules diffused across the interface. The mass uptake and formation of entanglements, as obtained from primitive path analysis, are extracted and correlated with the interfacial strength obtained from shear simulations. We find that the diffusion across the interface is significantly faster in the damaged film compared to welding because of the presence of short chains. Though interfacial entanglements increase more rapidly for the damaged films, a large fraction of these entanglements are near chain ends. As a result, the interfacial strength of the healing film increases more slowly than for welding. For both healing and welding, the interfacial strength saturates as the bulk entanglement density is recovered across the interface. However, the saturation strength of the damaged film is below the bulk strength for the polymer sample. At saturation, cut chains remain near the healing interface. They are less entangled and as a result they mechanically weaken the interface. Chain stiffness increases the density of entanglements, which increases the strength of the interface. Our results show that a few entanglements across the interface are sufficient to resist interfacial chain pullout and enhance the mechanical strength.									9	0	0	0	0	9			2470-0045	2470-0053		WOS:000341258800006	25122327

It is well known that phytochemicals in cranberries have anti-oxidative and antimicrobial activities. Recently, an increasing body of evidence has demonstrated that cranberry phytochemicals may have potential benefits that promote healthy aging. Here, we use Caenarhabditis elegans as a model to show that water-soluble cranberry extract standardized to 4.0% proanthocyanidins (WCESP), a major component of cranberries, can enhance host innate immunity resist against Vibro cholerae (V. cholerae; wild type C6706 (O1 El Tor biotype)) infection. Supplementationof WCESPdid not significantly alter the intestinal colonization of V. cholerae, but upregulated the expression of C. elegans innate immune genes, such as clec-7 clec-71, fmo-2, pqn-5 and C23G10.1. Additionally, WCESP treatment did not affect the growth of V. cholerae and expression of he major bacterial virulence genes, and only slightly reduced bacterial colonization within C. elegans intestine. These findings indicate that the major components Of WCESP, including proanthocyanidins (PACs), may play an important role in enhancing the host innate immunity. Moreover, we engaged C. elegans mutants and identified that the p38 MAPK signaling, insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS), and HSF-1 play pivotal roles in the WCESP-mediated host immune response. Considering the level of conservation between the innate immune pathways of C. elegans and humans, the results of this study suggest that WCESP may also play an immunity-promoting role in higher order organism.									5	1	0	3	0	5			1932-6203			WOS:000339992600053	25062095

Deposition near 0.84T(g) produces glasses of very high kinetic stability; these materials are comparable in stability to the most stable glasses produced from more fragile glass formers. Highly stable glasses of MMT, when annealed above T-g, transform into the supercooled liquid by a heterogeneous mechanism. A constant velocity propagating front is initiated at the free surface and controls the transformation of thin films. The transition to a bulk-dominated transformation process occurs at 5 mu m, the largest length scale reported for any glass. Contrary to recent conclusions, we find that physical vapor deposition can form highly stable organic glasses across the entire range of liquid fragilities.									27	0	0	1	0	27			0031-9007	1079-7114		WOS:000339620300011	25105633

Beyond the widely reported bright fluorescence emissions in carbon dots, their excellent photoinduced redox properties that resemble those found in conventional semiconductor nanostructures are equally valuable, with photon electron conversion applications from photovoltaic,s to CO2 photocatalytic reduction. In this work we used gold-doped carbon dots from controlled synthesis as water-soluble catalysts for a closer examination of the visible-light photoconversion of CO2 into small organic acids, including acetic acid (for which the reduction requires many more electrons than that for formic acid) and, more interestingly, for the significantly enhanced photoconversion with higher CO2 pressures over an aqueous solution of the photocatalysts. The results demonstrate the nanoscale semiconductor-equivalent nature of carbon dots, with excellent potential in energy conversion applications.									13	1	0	1	0	13			0743-7463			WOS:000339463000046	24972094

Spatial distribution of stink bugs (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) in wheat								JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE				14						98				JUL 22 2014	2014	A two-year study was conducted in South Carolina wheat (Triticum aestivum L. (Poales: Poaceae)) fields to describe spatial and temporal dynamics of stink bugs (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), which were sampled weekly with sweep nets. In 2010, the main phytophagous stink bugs caught in a grid sampling plan across two fields were the brown stink bug, Euschistus servus (Say), the rice stink bug, Oebalus pugnax (F.), the southern green stink bug, Nezara viridula (L.), and the red shouldered stink bug, Thyanta custator (F.), for both adults and nymphs. In 2011, the main phytophagous stink bugs were E. servus, O. pugnax, N. viridula, and T. custator across two fields. Adult stink bug counts adjacent to fallow fields were 2.1-fold greater for all species combined compared with counts adjacent to woods. Spatial Analysis by Distance IndicEs (SADIE) indicated significant aggregation for 35% of analyses for adults and nymph stink bugs at each sampling date. As a measure of spatial and temporal stability, positive SADIE association indices among sampling dates recorded 11, 36, 43, and 16% of analyses for adult E. servus and 7, 50, 50, and 14% for adult O. pugnax in fields A, B, C, and D, respectively. Adult and nymph stink bugs were spatially associated within wheat fields based on SADIE association indices. Seasonal counts of stink bugs were spatially associated with spike counts at least once for each species across the four fields. Future work may investigate practices to reduce stink bug buildup on wheat in the spring and movement to susceptible crops such as corn, Zea mays L.									5	0	0	4	0	5			1536-2442	2250-2645		WOS:000339314500002	25205358

A low-pass filter with a similar to 2 GHz cutoff frequency and a band-pass filter with a similar to 3 GHz center frequency are designed and incorporated into an interferometer to achieve ultra-high sensitivity RF detections. Compared with coplanar waveguides, the filters have up to 10-times longer group delays and 9-times stronger localized RF E-fields. Thus, the interactions between RF fields and material-under-test, which is a slab of polydimethylsiloxane in this work, are significantly enhanced. The interferometer sensitivities are boosted by up to 11 times for operating frequency shifts and 25 dB for magnitude change at frequencies up to 12 GHz.

J	He, Qifan; Daqaq, Mohammed F.								Influence of potential function asymmetries on the performance of nonlinear energy harvesters under white noise								JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION				333	15			3479	3489		10.1016/j.jsv.2014.03.034			JUL 21 2014	2014	To improve the broadband transduction capabilities of vibratory energy harvesters (VEHs) under random and non-stationary excitations, many researchers have resorted to purposefully introducing nonlinearities into the restoring force of the harvester. While performing this task, it is often very challenging to maintain a perfectly symmetric restoring force which yields a VEH with an asymmetric potential energy function. This paper investigates the influence of potential function asymmetries on the performance of nonlinear VEHs under white noise inputs. To that end, a quadratic nonlinearity is introduced into the restoring force and its influence on the mean output power of the harvester for mono- and bi-stable quartic potentials is investigated. It is shown that, for VEHs with a mono-stable quartic potential function, the mean output power increases with the degree of potential function asymmetry. On the other hand, for energy harvesters with a bi-stable quartic potential function, asymmetries in the restoring force appear to worsen performance especially for low to moderate noise intensities. When the noise intensity becomes sufficiently large, the influence of the potential function's asymmetry on the mean power diminishes. Results also reveal that a VEH with a symmetric bi-stable quartic potential function produces higher mean power levels than the one with the most asymmetric mono-stable potential. As such, it is concluded that a VEH with a symmetric bi-stable potential is most desirable to improve performance under white noise. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

HD100546 MULTI-EPOCH SCATTERED LIGHT OBSERVATIONS								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				790	1					56	10.1088/0004-637X/790/1/56			JUL 20 2014	2014	We presentH, Ks, andL filter polarimetric differential imaging (PDI) data for the transitional disk around HD100546 obtained in 2013, together with an improved re- reduction of previously published 2006 data. We reveal the disk in polarized scattered light in all three filters, achieving an inner working angle of 0.1. Additional, short- exposure observations in the H and Ks filters probe the surroundings of the star down to 0. 03 3 AU). HD100546 is fascinating because of its variety of sub- structures possibly related to forming planets in the disk, and PDI is currently the best technique for imaging them in the near- IR. For the first time ever, we detect a disk in L- band PDI data, and we constrain the outer radius of the inner hole to 14 2 AU and its eccentricity to < 0.133. A dark lane is detected between 0. 2- 0. 6 AU in the front side of the disk, which is likely an effect of the scattering angle and the scattering function of the grains. We find a spiral arm in the northeast that has no obvious connection to spiral arms seen before by other authors further out in the disk, but winds are in the same direction (clockwise). The two bright scattering peaks along the semi- major axis are asymmetric, with the southeastern one being significantly brighter. This could be related to the inner companion candidate that is close to the brighter side of the disk at the time of the observations. The scattering color is close to gray between the H and Ks filters ([H]-[Ks] = 0.19 0.11), but the scattering in the L - filter is significantly weaker ([H]-[L ] = - 1.08 +/- 0.35, [Ks]-[L] = - 1.27 +/- 0.35). We measure the position angle of the disk to be 138. +/- 3., consistent with previous observations, and we derive the dust scattering function in the H and Ks filters between 35. and 130. at two different radii (30- 50 and 80-110 AU) and show that our results are consistent with a disk that is more strongly flared in the outer regions.									27	0	0	0	0	27			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000338836800056

We have analyzed an X-Shooter/Very Large Telescope spectrum to provide accurate stellar parameters and accretion rate. The analysis of the spectrum, together with constraints provided by the spectral energy distribution fitting, the distance to the star (140 +/- 20 pc), and the use of evolutionary tracks and isochrones, led to the following set of parameters: T-eff = 6550 +/- 100 K, log g = 3.75 +/- 0.10, L-*/L-circle dot = 16.3 +/- 4.5, M-*/M-circle dot = 2.0 +/- 0.3, and an age of 5.0 +/- 1.5 Myr. This stellar age provides further constraints to the mass of the possible companion estimated by Biller et al., being between 0.20 and 0.35 M-circle dot. Stellar accretion rates obtained from UV Balmer excess modeling and optical photospheric line veiling, and from the correlations with several emission lines spanning from the UV to the near-IR, are consistent with each other. The mean value from all previous tracers is 2 (+/- 1) x 10(-7) M-circle dot yr(-1), which is within the upper limit gas flow rate from the outer to the inner disk recently provided by Cassasus et al.. This suggests that almost all gas transferred between both components of the disk is not trapped by the possible planet(s) in between but fall onto the central star, although it is discussed how the gap flow rate could be larger than previously suggested. In addition, we provide evidence showing that the stellar accretion rate of HD 142527 has increased by a factor similar to 7 on a timescale of 2 to 5 yr.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000338836800021		
J	Wang, Zhengxin; Marcus, R. Kenneth								Determination of pore size distributions in capillary-channeled polymer fiber stationary phases by inverse size-exclusion chromatography and implications for fast protein separations								JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A				1351				82	89		10.1016/j.chroma.2014.05.033			JUL 18 2014	2014	Capillary-channeled polymer (C-CP) fibers have been utilized as liquid chromatography stationary phases, primarily for biomacromolecule separations on the analytical and preparative scales. The collinear packing of the eight-channeled C-CP fibers provides for very efficient flow, allowing operation at high linear velocity (u > 100 mm s(-1)) and low backpressure (<2000 psi) in analytical-scale separations. To take advantage of these fluid transport properties, there must not be mass transfer limitations as would be imposed by having an appreciably porous phase, wherein solute diffusion limits the overall mass transport rates. To better understand the physical nano-/micro- structure of C-CP fibers, inverse size exclusion chromatography (iSEC) has been employed to determine the pore size distribution (PSD) within C-CP fibers. A diversity of test species (from metal ions to large proteins) was used as probes under non-retaining conditions to obtain a response curve reflecting the apparent partition coefficient (K-d) versus hydrodynamic radii (r(m)). A mean pore radius (r(p)) of 4.2 nm with standard deviation (S-p) of +/- 1.1 nm was calculated by fitting the K-d versus rm data to model equations with a Gaussian pore size distribution, and a pore radius of 4.0 +/- 0.1 nm was calculated based on a log-normal distribution. The derived mean pore radius is much smaller than traditional support materials, with the standard deviation showing a relatively uniform pore distribution. van Deemter plots were analyzed to provide practical confirmation of the structural implications. Large molecules (e.g., proteins) that are fully excluded from pores have no significant C-terms in the van Deemter plots whereas small molecules that can access the pore volumes display appreciable C-terms, as expected. Fitting of retention data to the Knox equation suggests that the columns operate with a characteristic particle diameter (d(p)) of similar to 53 mu m. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

For the purpose of this investigation, a new tool for modeling the electrostatic potential profile along the axis normal to the membrane, MEMbrane POTential (MEMPOT), was developed and implemented in DelPhi. Applying MEMPOT on the snapshots obtained by MD simulations, two observations were made: (a) the average electrostatic potential has a complex profile but is mostly positive inside the membrane due to the presence of Ca2+ ions, which overcompensate for the negative potential created by lipid phosphate groups; and (b) correct modeling of the electrostatic potential profile across the membrane requires taking into account the water phase, while neglecting it (vacuum calculations) results in dramatic changes including a reversal of the sign of the potential inside the membrane. Furthermore, using DelPhi to assign different dielectric constants for different regions of the LPS membranes, it was investigated whether a single frame structure before MD simulations with appropriate dielectric constants for the lipid tails, inner, and the external leaflet regions, can deliver the same average electrostatic potential distribution as obtained from the MDgenerated ensemble of structures. Indeed, this can be attained by using smaller dielectric constant for the tail and inner leaflet regions (mostly hydrophobic) than for the external leaflet region (hydrophilic) and the optimal dielectric constant values are chemotype-specific.

A thorough evaluation of ecological responses to seasonally frozen ground is hampered by our inability to adequately characterize the frequency, depth, duration and intensity of soil frost events. We evaluated the use of ground penetrating radar to nondestructively delineate soil frost under field conditions in three forest ecosystems. Soil frost depth was monitored periodically using a 900 MHz antenna in South Burlington, Vermont (SB), Sleepers River Watershed, North Danville, Vermont (SR) and Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire (HBEF) during winter 2011-2012 on plots with snow and cleared of snow. GPR-based estimates were compared to data from thermistors and frost tubes, which estimate soil frost depth with a color indicating solution. In the absence of snow, frost was initially detected at a depth of 8-10 cm. Dry snow up to 35 cm deep, enhanced near-surface frost detection, raising the minimum frost detection depth to 4-5 cm. The most favorable surface conditions for GPR detection were bare soil or shallow dry snow where frost had penetrated to the minimum detectable depth. Unfavorable conditions included: standing water on frozen soil, wet snow, thawed surface soils and deep snow pack. Both SB and SR were suitable for frost detection most of the winter, while HBEF was not. Tree roots were detected as point reflections and were readily discriminated from continuous frost reflections. The bias of GPR frost depth measurements relative to thermistors was site dependent averaging 0.1 cm at SB and 1.1 cm at SR, and was not significantly different than zero. When separated by snow manipulation treatment at SR, overestimation of soil frost depth (5.5 cm) occurred on plots cleared of snow and underestimation (-1.5 cm) occurred on plots with snow. Despite some limitations posed by site and surface suitability, GPR could be useful for adding a spatial component to pre-installed soil frost monitoring networks.

We evaluate the simulations by comparing their predicted light curves with many observed SNe Ia using the SALT2 data-driven model and find that the simulations may correspond to under-luminous SNe Iax. We explore the effects of the initial conditions on our results by varying the number of randomly selected ignition points from 63 to 3500, and the radius of the centered sphere they are confined in from 128 to 384 km. We find that the rate of nuclear burning depends on the number of ignition points at early times, the density of ignition points at intermediate times, and the radius of the confining sphere at late times. The results depend primarily on the number of ignition points, but we do not expect this to be the case in general. The simulations with few ignition points release more nuclear energy E-nuc, have larger kinetic energies E-K, and produce more Ni-56 than those with many ignition points, and differ in the distribution of Ni-56, Si, and C/O in the ejecta. For these reasons, the simulations with few ignition points exhibit higher peak B-band absolute magnitudes M-B and light curves that rise and decline more quickly; their M-B and light curves resemble those of under-luminous SNe Iax, while those for simulations with many ignition points are not.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000338674900012

The temperature, density, proton fraction, and fission time required to fit the experimental data are derived and discussed. A reasonably good fit to the experimental data is obtained. This model provides a natural explanation for the observed yields of heavier isotopes relative to those of the lighter isotopes, the observation of low proton yields relative to H-2 and H-3 yields, and the nonobservation of He-3, all features which are shared by similar thermal neutron-induced and spontaneous fissioning systems.									3	0	0	0	0	3			2469-9985	2469-9993		WOS:000339217500001

The advent of helically coiled micro/nanoscale structures in nano-robotics, nano-inductors, and impact protection coatings has necessitated the development of new methodologies for determining their shear and tensile properties. Accordingly, we developed a synergistic protocol which (i) integrates analytical, numerical (i.e., finite element usingCOMSOLH (R)) and experimental (harmonic detection of resonance; HDR) methods to obtain an empirically validated closed form expression for the shear modulus and resonance frequency of a singly clamped helically coiled carbon nanowire (HCNW), and (ii) circumvents the need for solving 12th order differential equations. From the experimental standpoint, a visual detection of resonances (using in situ scanning electron microscopy) combined with HDR revealed intriguing non-planar resonance modes at much lower driving forces relative to those needed for linear carbon nanotube cantilevers. Interestingly, despite the presence of mechanical and geometrical nonlinearities in the HCNW resonance behavior the ratio of the first two transverse modes f2/f1 was found to be similar to the ratio predicted by the Euler-Bernoulli theorem for linear cantilevers.									2	0	0	0	0	2			2045-2322			WOS:000338421100001	24986377	
J	Boylan, Gregory L.; Cho, Byung Rae								Solving the Multidisciplinary Robust Parameter Design Problem for Mixed Type Quality Characteristics under Asymmetric Conditions								QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL				30	5			681	695		10.1002/qre.1520			JUL 2014	2014	Quality practitioners often identify robust parameter design (RPD) as one of the most important and effective methods for process and quality improvement. Within this framework, identifying the optimal factor settings that achieve desired process targets with minimum variance is critical and can translate to significant reductions in product waste and processing costs. In solving this problem, most traditional RPD models consider only a single quality characteristic of interest. However, products are often judged by multiple quality characteristics, which often have conflicting objectives. Conventional RPD models that address the multi-response problem typically only examine like-type cases, and those that consider mixed types of quality characteristics often overlook any asymmetry that is likely to exist in certain types. In contrast, this article proposes a multidisciplinary RPD methodology that provides an enhanced approach for modeling multiple, mixed type quality characteristics; uses the skew normal distribution to allow for a fuller and more accurate representation of asymmetric system properties and to facilitate simultaneous modeling of both symmetric and asymmetric conditions; and implements a priority-based optimization scheme that affords engineers' and decision makers' flexibility in establishing and modifying optimization priorities. A numerical example is used to demonstrate the proposed methodology, and the results are compared traditional approaches to illustrate potential improvements.

THE CIXIID PLANTHOPPER HAPLAXIUS OVATUS (BALL) (HEMIPTERA: FULGOROIDEA): ASSOCIATION WITH SWITCHGRASS (PANICUM VIRGATUM; POACEAE) AND NEW DISTRIBUTION RECORDS								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON				116	3			358	368		10.4289/0013-8797.116.3.358			JUL 2014	2014	Haplaxius ovatus (Ball) is a little-known cixiid planthopper whose host plants were unknown. During fieldwork in late May, late June early July, and late August-early September from 2010 to 2013, we collected adults (n = 778) on switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.; Poaceae: Panicoideae) at 59 sites in nine states: Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. New state records are Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. The cixiid was not encountered during less extensive collecting from other prairie grasses: big bluestem, Andropogon gerardii Vitman; little bluestem, Schizachyrium scoparium (Michx.) Nash; Indiangrass, Sorghastrum nutans (L.) Nash; and prairie cordgrass, Spartina pectinata Bosc ex Link. In Nebraska, where switchgrass surveys were most extensive, H. ovatus typically was found in the Tallgrass and Mixedgrass Prairie ecoregions (remnant prairies and roadsides), was uncommon in the Sandhills, and was present along the eastern edge (-102 degrees W longitude) of Shortgrass Prairie. Cixiid nymphs are subterranean, and no attempt was made to detect nymphs of H. ovatus. Male-biased populations and presence of teneral adults (mostly females) in late May, however, suggest a recent emergence from P. virgatum. The few adults taken in late August-early September are assumed to represent those still persisting from the only complete generation (univoltinism). Characters are provided to facilitate the recognition of this switchgrass-associated cixiid. Additional study is needed to verify that H. ovatus overwinters as nymphs, develops on P. virgatum, and is univoltine, as well as determine if it might use related species of Panicum, other panicoid genera, or even non-panicoid grasses as hosts.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-8797			WOS:000343187700011		
J	Hoffman, Mark A.; Lawler, Benjamin J.; Filipi, Zoran S.; Gueralp, Orgun A.; Najt, Paul M.								Development of a Device for the Nondestructive Thermal Diffusivity Determination of Combustion Chamber Deposits and Thin Coatings								JOURNAL OF HEAT TRANSFER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME				136	7					071601	10.1115/1.4026908			JUL 2014	2014	An experimental radiation chamber has been developed to nondestructively measure the thermal diffusivity of a combustion chamber deposit (CCD) layer. The accumulation of CCD shifts the operability range of homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) to lower loads where the fuel economy benefit of HCCI over a traditional spark ignition strategy is at a maximum. The formation and burn-off of CCD introduce operational variability, which increases the control system burden of a practical HCCI engine. To fully characterize the impact of CCD on HCCI combustion and develop strategies which limit the CCD imposed variability, the thermal and physical properties of HCCI CCD must be determined without destroying the morphology of the CCD layer. The radiation chamber device provides a controlled, inert atmosphere absent of cyclical pressure oscillations and fuel/air interactions found within an engine. The device exposes temperature probes coated with CCD to controlled heat flux pulses generated by a graphite emitter and a rotating disk. CCD layer thermal diffusivity is then calculated based on the phase delay of the sub-CCD temperature response relative to the response of the temperature probe when clean. This work validates the accuracy of the radiation chamber's diffusivity determination methodology by testing materials of known properties. Wafers of three different materials, whose thermal diffusivities span two orders of magnitude centered on predicted CCD diffusivity values, are installed over the temperature probes to act as CCD surrogates. Multiple thicknesses of each material are tested over a range of heat flux pulse durations. Diffusivity values determined from radiation chamber testing are independent of sample thickness with each of the three calibration materials. The radiation chamber diffusivity values exhibit a slight, but consistent underprediction for all wafers due to residual contact resistance at the wafer-probe interface. Overall, the validation studies establish the radiation chamber as an effective device for the nondestructive thermal diffusivity determination of thin insulative coatings. The similarity of expected CCD diffusivity values to those of the validation specimens instills confidence that the methodology and device presented herein can be successfully utilized in the characterization of HCCI CCD layers.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0022-1481	1528-8943		WOS:000349231100004

This study was conducted to determine-the soil and landscape characteristics that correlate with invasion of Chinese privet (CHP), and to develop a model to predict the probability of CHP invasion in Piedmont forests. A landscape ecosystem classification (LEC) system-based on the percentage of clay in the B horizon, depth to maximum clay (cm), exposure, terrain shape, and aspect (degrees)-was used to determine the soil moisture characteristics of invaded and uninvaded plots. Additional measurements included the cover classes of CHP and other species, litter depth (cm), slope (degrees), overstory basal area (m(2) ha(-1)), and soil chemical properties. CHP invasion was negatively correlated with overstory basal area and slope and positively with litter depth and pH. A stepwise logistic regression model containing these four variables was highly sensitive, with an overall accuracy of 78%. Given the accuracy of this model, we propose that it can be used to calculate the probability of invasion in a given area, provided that some basic, readily obtainable site characteristics are known.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1939-7291	1939-747X		WOS:000344911100010

There exist a wide variety of methods for conducting such assessments, with little consensus in the field. The purpose of this study was to conduct a review and meta-analysis of single-case design studies focusing on interventions based on the assessment of contextual variables (i.e., circumstances that form the setting for the behaviors). Results indicated that although most studies demonstrated positive effects that were corroborated by a variety of effect size measures, few met the majority of evidence-based quality indicators.

Drinking With an Unsealed Tube: Fluid Uptake Along the Butterfly Proboscis								ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				107	4			886	892		10.1603/AN14027			JUL 2014	2014	Most adult Lepidoptera depend on a proboscis for fluid uptake. Although the proboscis has been regarded as a sealed tube with fluid uptake restricted to the distal end, recent evidence indicates that it is permeable along its entire length in at least some species. We, therefore, tested the effectiveness of the seal during feeding in four species of butterflies. Feeding rates in monarchs (Danaus plexippus L.), painted ladies (Vanessa cardui L.), and tiger swallowtails (Papilio glaucus L.) did not differ significantly when the proboscises were straightened and fully, versus partially, submersed in 1 or 15% sucrose solutions. To explore these results, we tested fluid uptake along the nearly transparent proboscises of buckeye butterflies (Junonia coenia Hu " bner) by applying colored droplets of water to the legular seam between the paired galeae. Colored fluid appeared in the food canal of straightened and naturally flexed proboscises within 10 s, regardless of whether the chemosensilla were stimulated with sugar. Statistically significant entry of fluid, however, occurred approximate to 30 s after droplets were applied and only if the proboscis was naturally flexed and stimulated with sucrose. The results suggest that fluid uptake along the length of the proboscis is influenced by changes in legular spacing when the butterfly naturally bends the proboscis and on activation of the cibarial pump when chemosensilla are stimulated with sugar.									3	0	0	2	0	3			0013-8746	1938-2901		WOS:000338842600023

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's HRQOL-4 was used to assess factors associated with HRQOL through multivariate logistic regression models with survey weighting. Stepwise model selection was applied to select the most significant factors for HRQOL in each racial/ethnic group.ResultsHispanic participants were less likely to report 14 or more mentally unhealthy days and activity-limited days compared to non-Hispanic white counterparts, adjusting for age, sex, education, marital status, family poverty-income ratio (PIR), body mass index, smoking status, insurance coverage, and diabetes duration. Current smoking status and obesity were significantly associated with worse HRQOL among whites and blacks. Marital status predicted better HRQOL only among Hispanics. Having insurance coverage predicted better HRQOL among both blacks and Hispanics. Increased family PIR had a favorable association with the 4 HRQOL domains consistently among all races/ethnicities.ConclusionMinimal racial/ethnic disparities in HRQOL were observed among US adults with self-reported diabetes. Support is offered for more individualized health care and communication with patients to target care and interventions that improve health and quality-of-life indicators.									8	0	0	4	0	8			0145-7217	1554-6063		WOS:000342906400012	24737884

Most face continuing pressure to meet the increasing infrastructure demands of their state with limited resources. Professional services consultant procurement and contract administration are significant and important components of the infrastructure delivery process. How these professional services contracts are procured and managed can have a substantial impact on organizational resources, personnel efficiency and effectiveness, consultant performance, and infrastructure cost and quality. This paper investigates the current practice of the departments of transportation in seven states, interviews subject matter experts, evaluates scholarly work by industry and academic professionals, and examines previous studies to develop 12 best practices for the procurement and contract administration of professional services consultants. The study identified 12 best practices in the following areas: strategic planning; quality management; professional services management structure; standardization; operations manual, training and certification; automation; contract-specific procurement plans; indefinite delivery contracts; lump sum contracting; and performance metrics.

For this purpose, polypropylene-based nano-composites were prepared using carbon-coated TiO2 nanoparticles and commercially available TiO2 nanoparticles (Degussa, P25). Our results from SEM, FTIR, and tensile tests showed that the photocatalytic property of TiO2 causes chain scission reactions, crosslinking and consequently photocatalytic degradation of polypropylene that affects the mechanical properties of exposed nano-composites. We have observed that with greater carbon content of the TiO2 nano-powders, there is less photocatalytic degradation.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1516-1439	1980-5373		WOS:000342348700030

Constraining the structure of the transition disk HD 135344B (SAO 206462) by simultaneous modeling of multiwavelength gas and dust observations								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				567						A51	10.1051/0004-6361/201322534			JUL 2014	2014	Context. Constraining the gas and dust disk structure of transition disks, particularly in the inner dust cavity, is a crucial step toward understanding the link between them and planet formation. HD 135344B is an accreting (pre-)transition disk that displays the CO 4.7 mu m emission extending tens of AU inside its 30 AU dust cavity.Aims. We constrain HD 135344B's disk structure from multi-instrument gas and dust observations.Methods. We used the dust radiative transfer code MCFOST and the thermochemical code ProDiMo to derive the disk structure from the simultaneous modeling of the spectral energy distribution (SED), VLT/CRIRES CO P(10) 4.75 mu m, Herschel/PACS [OI] 63 mu m, Spitzer/IRS, and JCMT (CO)-C-12 J = 3-2 spectra, VLTI/PIONIER H-band visibilities, and constraints from (sub)mm continuum interferometry and near-IR imaging.Results. We found a disk model able to describe the current gas and dust observations simultaneously. This disk has the following structure. (1) To simultaneously reproduce the SED, the near-IR interferometry data, and the CO ro-vibrational emission, refractory grains (we suggest carbon) are present inside the silicate sublimation radius (0.08 <R < 0.2 AU). (2) The dust cavity (R < 30 AU) is filled with gas, the surface density of the gas inside the cavity must increase with radius to fit the CO ro-vibrational line profile, a small gap of a few AU in the gas distribution is compatible with current data, and a large gap of tens of AU in the gas does not appear likely. (4) The gas-to-dust ratio inside the cavity is >100 to account for the 870 pm continuum upper limit and the CO P(10) line flux, (5) The gas-to-dust ratio in the outer disk (30 <R < 200 AU) is <10 to simultaneously describe the [OI] 63 mu m line flux and the CO P(10) line profile. (6) In the outer disk, most of the gas and dust mass should be located in the midplane, and a significant fraction of the dust should be in large grains.Conclusions. Simultaneous modeling of the gas and dust is required to break the model degeneracies and constrain the disk structure. An increasing gas surface density with radius in the inner cavity echoes the effect of a migrating jovian planet in the disk structure. The low gas mass (a few Jupiter masses) throughout the HD 135344B disk supports the idea that it is an evolved disk that has already lost a large portion of its mass.									25	0	0	0	0	25			1432-0746			WOS:000341185300017

Investigating the evolution of protoplanetary disks is crucial for our understanding of star and planet formation. There have been several theoretical and observational studies in past decades to advance this knowledge. The launch of satellites operating at infrared wavelengths, such as the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Herschel Space Observatory, has provided important tools for investigating the properties of circumstellar disks.Aims. FT Tauri is a young star in the Taurus star forming region that was included in a number of spectroscopic and photometric surveys. We investigate the properties of the star, the circinnstellar disk, and the accretion/ejection processes and propose a consistent gas and dust model also as a reference for future observational studies.Methods. We performed a multiwavelength data analysis to derive the basic stellar and disk properties. as well as mass accretion/outflow rate from THG/DOLoRes. WHT/LIRIS, NOT/NOTCam. Reck/NIRSpec, and Her,schei/PACS spectra. From the literature, we compiled a complete spectral energy distribution. We then performed detailed disk modeling using the MCFOST and ProDiMo codes. Multiwavelength spectroscopic and photometric measurements were compared with the reddened rnedictions of the codes in order to constrain the disk properties.Results. We have determined the stellar mass (similar to 0.3 M-circle dot), luminosity (similar to 0.35 L-circle dot). and age (similar to 1.6 Myr) as well as the visual extinction of the system (1.8 mag). We estimate the mass accretion rate (similar to 3 x 10(-8) M-circle dot/yr) to be within the range of accreting objects in Taurus. The evolutionary state and the geometric properties of the disk are also constrained. The radial extent (0.05 to 200 AU), flaring angle (power law with exponent = 1.15), and mass (0.02 M-circle dot) of the circumstellar disk are typical of a young primordial disk. This object can serve as a benchmark for primordial disks with significant mass accretion rate, high gas content, and typical size.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1432-0746			WOS:000341185300012

The probes were made by direct femtosecond (fs) laser micromachining of nanometer structures on the fiber endface and subsequent chemical plating of a thin layer of silver. Rhodamine 6G solutions were used to evaluate the performance of the SERS probes. In comparison with the silica fibers, the single-crystal sapphire fiber has much lower background Raman scattering. The fs laser is found effective to fabricate high-quality sapphire fiber SERS probes for detection of weak Raman signals in a reflection configuration.									8	0	0	0	0	8			1041-1135	1941-0174		WOS:000341505200007

The markup for gross leases varies between properties and across markets. A matching procedure is applied to measure the services markup as the percentage difference between the actual rent on a gross lease relative to the actual rent on a net lease in an office building with similar characteristics. Using a set of 3,548 office gross lease observations in six major U.S. office markets, we estimate the determinants of the gross rent markup and find statistically significant evidence supporting the posited effects.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0896-5803			WOS:000341467700002

Their adhesives have unique attributes that define them as targets for bio-inspired adhesive development. With the aid of multi-photon and broadband coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscopies, we report that the larval adhesive of barnacle cyprids is a bi-phasic system containing lipids and phosphoproteins, working synergistically to maximize adhesion to diverse surfaces under hostile conditions. Lipids, secreted first, possibly displace water from the surface interface creating a conducive environment for introduction of phosphoproteins while simultaneously modulating the spreading of the protein phase and protecting the nascent adhesive plaque from bacterial biodegradation. The two distinct phases are contained within two different granules in the cyprid cement glands, implying far greater complexity than previously recognized.

Global warming can affect the distributions, phenology and, ultimately, conservation status of species worldwide, but most published studies on its biological effects have focused on higher latitude species. We extended this work to the Diana fritillary, a butterfly which once ranged throughout the Southeastern United States but now is severely restricted in range.2. We searched for all scientific records of this species, from publications, catalogued and uncatalogued specimens in public and private collections in the United States and Europe, online databases, contemporary field surveys by scientists and amateurs, and our own field surveys. We analysed these records for shifts in latitude, longitude, elevation and phenology.3. We found that the Diana fritillary has disappeared entirely from the Atlantic coastal plain, where it was first described, and from interior lowland sites. It now persists in two disjunct parts of its former range, the Southern Appalachian Mountains and the Interior Highlands of Oklahoma and Arkansas, and is shifting to higher elevations at about 18 m per decade. In addition, females are being collected 4.3 days earlier per decade though males, which emerge first, have not shifted their phenology. All these patterns are weakly dependent on latitude.4. These shifts in distribution and phenology are consistent with the predicted effects of global warming, but we review other large scale changes to the region which also might contribute singly or jointly to these patterns. We also comment on the implications for the conservation of this species.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1752-458X	1752-4598		WOS:000340596100008

However, theoretical and laboratory works have demonstrated that the metal ion's neutralization process is quite difficult above 100 km, while intensive neutral metal layers are consistently observed in the lower E region between 100 km and 125 km. In this paper, the multiyear observations of a Na lidar and an ionosonde at Utah State University (41.7 degrees N, 111.8 degrees W) and the nearby Bear Lake Observatory (41.9 degrees N, 111.4 degrees W) are utilized to understand their seasonal and local time variations. The comparison study between this set of the Na-s and the nocturnal Na-s observations in Beijing China (40.2 degrees N, 116.1 degrees E) reveals similar variations, but major differences are also noticed. To investigate the mechanism of these variations, the Hamburg Model of the Neutral and Ionized Atmosphere and the Climatological Tidal Model of the Thermosphere are utilized to simulate the ion vertical drift in the lower E region. The simulation shows that the lower E region is dominated by convergence of metal ions in summer, and ion diffusion prevails during winter. The tidal wind modulates the ion vertical drift speed and increases the likelihood of E-s evolution at certain local times during the summer, while the tidal components of atmospheric density facilitate Na-s formation by neutralizing the Na+ within the E-s.									4	0	0	0	0	4			2169-9380	2169-9402		WOS:000340549000063		
J	Sliter, Michael; Boyd, Elizabeth; Sinclair, Robert; Cheung, Janelle; McFadden, Anna								Inching Toward Inclusiveness: Diversity Climate, Interpersonal Conflict and Well-Being in Women Nurses								SEX ROLES				71	1-2	SI		43	54		10.1007/s11199-013-0337-5			JUL 2014	2014	Interpersonal conflict is a type of mistreatment acknowledged to be a serious problem in the United States workplace, particularly for women. This interpersonal conflict is related to negative outcomes in women, as well as the exclusion of women in the workplace, which highlights the importance of investigating ways to reduce this conflict. There is reason to believe that features of the social work environment may impact the prevalence of interpersonal conflict targeted at women. In particular, the extent to which a workplace includes social norms prohibiting mistreatment based on differences-a diversity climate-should be associated with lower levels of interpersonal conflict for women. As such, the goal of the current study was to examine the impact of diversity climate on the experience of interpersonal conflict in women. Additionally, well-being outcomes-burnout and engagement-were assessed as part of a model of diversity climate, interpersonal conflict, and outcomes. In a sample of 172 White women nurses from the northwestern U.S., three sources of conflict (physicians, manager and coworker) were found to relate negatively with diversity climate perceptions. Diversity climate perceptions were also associated with higher work engagement, and indirectly related to both engagement and burnout through conflict. The findings indicate that cultivating a diversity climate might be an important strategy to reduce interpersonal conflict experienced by women in the workplace.									3	0	0	1	0	3			0360-0025	1573-2762		WOS:000340501000005

Measurements of energy intake are commonly used for the study and treatment of obesity. However, the most widely used tools rely upon self-report and require a considerable manual effort, leading to underreporting of consumption, noncompliance, and discontinued use over the long term. The purpose of this paper is to describe a new method that uses a watch-like configuration of sensors to continuously track wrist motion throughout the day and automatically detect periods of eating. Our method uses the novel idea that meals tend to be preceded and succeeded by the periods of vigorous wrist motion. We describe an algorithm that segments and classifies such periods as eating or noneating activities. We also evaluate our method on a large dataset (43 subjects, 449 total h of data, containing 116 periods of eating) collected during free-living. Our results show an accuracy of 81% for detecting eating at 1-s resolution in comparison to manually marked event logs of periods eating. These results indicate that vigorous wrist motion is a useful indicator for identifying the boundaries of eating activities, and that our method should prove useful in the continued development of body-worn sensor tools for monitoring energy intake.									11	0	0	1	0	11			2168-2194			WOS:000340119000017	24058042

Influence of Aggregate Gradation on Clogging Characteristics of Porous Asphalt Mixtures								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING				26	7					04014026	10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0000975			JUL 2014	2014	This research investigates the influence of aggregate gradation on the clogging characteristics of porous asphalt mixtures. Ten representative gradations used for open graded friction course (OGFC) applications from across the United States were used in this evaluation. The aggregate gradation was found to be strongly correlated to the macrotexture depth of the porous pavement and the permeability of the mixes both before and after clogging. Utilizing graded sand as the clogging material, it was also found that the operational (or secondary) clogging rate is approximately half of the measured initial clogging rate. Additionally, the operational clogging rate can be estimated from the R 15 value for the system, which is the ratio of the D-15 of the porous asphalt gradation to the D-15 of the clogging material.

The results from this investigation suggested that mortar bar expansions could be correlated with specific oxide(s) content in the fly ash through exponential relationships. The dosage of lithium nitrate required for ASR mitigation in mortars containing fly ashes having CaO content less than 23.50% was found to be less than that in the control mortars. Since lithium nitrate was found to be effective in reducing the expansions of control (no fly ash) mortars and mortars containing fly ashes, economic solutions can be obtained in both. However, the use of lithium nitrate was not needed for mortars containing fly ashes having CaO content less than 14.40%. A linear relationship between the oxide content of fly ash and the lithium dosage was found to exist, that can be used to optimize the lithium dosage as a function of fly ash composition to provide an economic solution for ASR mitigation.

The effect of deposition temperature on the structural, optical, and electrical properties of the films was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy and reflectance accessory, and the van der Pauw method. All the thin films were deposited successfully onto quartz substrates and exhibited fibrous root morphology. At low temperature, the deposition rate was higher than at room temperature (RT) because of enhanced viscosity of the films. Further, lowering the deposition temperature affected the structural, optical, and electrical properties of the ZnO thin films. The surface morphology, residual stress, PL properties, and optical transmittance and reflectance of the films were measured, and this information was used to determine the absorption coefficient, optical band gap, Urbach energy, refractive index, refractive index at infinite wavelength, extinction coefficient, single-oscillator energy, dispersion energy, average oscillator wavelength, moments M-1 and M-3, dielectric constant, optical conductivity, and electrical resistivity of the ZnO thin films.									3	1	0	0	0	4			1738-8090	2093-6788		WOS:000339642600030

Both "Curie" and "anti-Curie" behavior were observed for the dimeric species, yet the monomeric species only showed "anti-Curie" behavior. Diffusion ordered spectroscopy experiments showed an increase in particle size for the two species, which is indicative of a dimeric species.

J	Delmas, Candice								Political Resistance: A Matter of Fairness								LAW AND PHILOSOPHY				33	4			465	488		10.1007/s10982-013-9189-y			JUL 2014	2014	In this paper, I argue that the principle of fairness can license both a duty of fair play, which is used to ground a moral duty to obey the law in just or nearly just societies, and a duty of resistance to unfair and unjust social schemes. The first part of the paper analyzes fairness' demands on participants in mutually beneficial schemes of coordination, and its implications in the face of injustice. Not only fairness does not require complying with unfair and unjust social schemes, but it also prohibits benefiting from such schemes. I use the case of racial segregation in the U.S. to illustrate this latter argument, and consider some objections to my investigation, given the availability and straightforwardness of justice. The second part of the paper elaborates the argument for the duty to resist. The Radical Reform argument first establishes, by elimination of the alternatives (exit and restitution), that the principal way for citizens to cease benefiting from an unfair and unjust social scheme is to radically reform it. The Resistance Argument then shows that resistance is crucial to bring about reform, so that one ought to resist unfair and unjust schemes from which one benefits. Next, I offer two arguments for collective resistance and political solidarity, one based on empirical considerations and the other based on fairness. Finally, I consider the costs of the resistance efforts which fairness may require.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0167-5249	1573-0522		WOS:000339726700002

The light rays are traced by leaves of a non-orientable foliation on a singular plane. We study the flow defined by the induced foliation on the orientation cover of the singular plane. The behaviour of that flow and ultimately our claim for the light rays are based on an analysis of the Teichmuller flow and the Kontsevich-Zorich cocycle on the moduli space of two-branched, two-sheeted torus covers in genus 2.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0951-7715	1361-6544		WOS:000339904700011

The dynamic densely grafted polyethylene glycol macromolecules enveloping mobility of the ferromagnetic chains originates from a layer of each nanoparticle in the chain. While ferromagnetic chains of unmodified Ni nanoparticles behave as stiff nickel nanorods, the chains made of the grafted nanoparticles demonstrate extreme flexibility. Upon changing the direction of the field, and inevitably going through a zero-field point, the shorter chains undergo chain-globule-chain transformation. The longer chains can bend to a high degree, attaining "snake-like" configurations.									10	0	0	0	0	10			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000339463100052	24950006

Don't Fear the Reaper: Trait Death Anxiety, Mortality Salience, and Occupational Health								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY				99	4			759	769		10.1037/a0035729			JUL 2014	2014	Despite multiple calls for research, there has been little effort to incorporate topics regarding mortality salience and death anxiety into workplace literature. As such, the goals of the current study were to (a) examine how trait differences in death anxiety relate to employee occupational health outcomes and (b) examine how death anxiety might exacerbate the negative effects of mortality salience cues experienced at work. In Study 1, we examined how death anxiety affected nurses in a multitime point survey. These results showed that trait death anxiety was associated with increased burnout and reduced engagement and that death anxiety further exacerbated the relationship between mortality salience cues (e. g., dealing with injured and dying patients) and burnout. These results were replicated and extended in Study 2, which examined the impact of death anxiety in firefighters. In this multitime point study, death anxiety related to burnout, engagement, and absenteeism. The results further showed that death anxiety moderated the relationship between mortality cues and burnout, where people high in trait death anxiety experience higher levels of burnout as a result of mortality cues than people lower in death anxiety. Across the 2 studies, despite differences in the methods (e. g., time lag; measures), the effect sizes and the form of the significant interactions were quite similar. Overall, these results highlight the importance of understanding death anxiety in the workplace, particularly in occupations where mortality salience cues are common. We discuss recommendations, such as death education and vocational counseling, and provide some avenues for future research.									3	0	0	1	0	3			0021-9010	1939-1854		WOS:000339397300018	24490968

Visual performance was measured in a laboratory-based testing session including visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, motion sensitivity and the useful field of view. Night-time pedestrian recognition distances were recorded while participants drove an instrumented vehicle along a closed road course at night; to increase the workload of drivers, auditory and visual distracter tasks were presented for some of the laps. Pedestrians walked in place, sideways to the oncoming vehicles, and wore either a standard high visibility reflective vest or reflective tape positioned on the movable joints (biological motion).Results: Driver age and pedestrian clothing significantly (p < 0.05) affected the distance at which the drivers first responded to the pedestrians. Older drivers recognised pedestrians at approximately half the distance of the younger drivers and pedestrians were recognised more often and at longer distances when they wore a biological motion reflective clothing configuration than when they wore a reflective vest. Motion sensitivity was an independent predictor of pedestrian recognition distance, even when controlling for driver age.Conclusions: The night-time pedestrian recognition capacity of older drivers was significantly worse than that of younger drivers. The distance at which drivers first recognised pedestrians at night was best predicted by a test of motion sensitivity.									5	0	0	1	0	5			0275-5408	1475-1313		WOS:000339486100007	24888897

Semitotal Domination in Graphs								UTILITAS MATHEMATICA				94				67	81					JUL 2014	2014	In this paper we introduce a parameter that is squeezed between arguably the two most important domination parameters, namely the domination number and the total domination number. We define a set S of vertices in a graph G with no isolated vertices to be a semitotal dominating set of G if it is a dominating set of G and every vertex in S is within distance 2 of another vertex of S. The semitotal domination number, denoted by gamma(t2)(G), is the minimum cardinality of a semitotal dominating set of G. We show that if G is a connected graph on n >= 4 vertices, then gamma(t2)(G) <= n/2, and we characterize the trees and graphs of minimum degree 2 achieving this bound.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0315-3681			WOS:000339457700006		
J	Hedetniemi, Stephen T.								New upper bounds for the pseudoachromatic and upper irredundance numbers of a graph								UTILITAS MATHEMATICA				94				83	100					JUL 2014	2014	Let G = (V, E) be a graph having order n = vertical bar V vertical bar vertices. The closed neighborhood of a vertex v is an element of V is the set N[v] = {u is an element of V vertical bar uv is an element of E} boolean OR {v}, and the closed neighborhood of a set S subset of V is the set N[S] = U-v is an element of S N[v]. A partition pi = {V-1, V-2,..., V-k} of the vertex set V is called a complete partition if for every 1 <= i <= j <= k, there exists a vertex u is an element of V-i that is adjacent to a vertex v is an element of V-j. The maximum order of a complete partition of a graph G is called the pseudoachromatic number psi(s)(G) of G. The upper irredundance number IR(G) equals the maximum order of a set S subset of V having the property that for every vertex v is an element of S, N[v] - N[S - {v}] not equal empty set. In this paper we discuss a variant of an old method that can be used to prove a variety of new results like the following: for any graph G of order n >= 2, IR(G) + psi(s)(G) <= n + 1.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0315-3681			WOS:000339457700007

These data were compared with microbiological indicator data (aerobic plate counts and coliform counts) collected from selected surfaces in each facility.Results from the two data sets were analyzed using nonparametric statistical methods to reveal potential risk factors for enteric disease transmission. Results: Statistically significant differences (P <= .05) in surface microbial counts were observed when comparing family child-care homes versus centers and between facilities participating in the Child and Adult Care Food Program and those that do not participate. Facilities without written surface cleaning or food preparation policies had statistically significantly higher microbial counts on surfaces.Conclusions: Our unique study, which combined observational and microbiological data, provided revealing information about the relationship between hygiene indicators and sanitary practices in child-care facilities in the southeastern United States.

Spatial variability in adult brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) survival within two intensively surveyed headwater stream networks								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES				71	7			1010	1019		10.1139/cjfas-2013-0358			JUL 2014	2014	Headwater stream networks are considered heterogeneous riverscapes, but it is challenging to characterize spatial variability in demographic rates. We estimated site-scale (50 m) survival of adult (>age 1+) brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) within two intensively surveyed headwater stream networks by applying an open-population N-mixture approach to count data collected over two consecutive summers. The estimated annual apparent survival rate was 0.37 (95% CI: 0.28-0.46) in one network and 0.31 (95% CI: 0.15-0.45) in the other network. In both networks, trout survival was higher in stream sites characterized by more abundant pool habitats. Trout survival was negatively associated with mean depth in one network and positively associated with stream gradient in the other. Stream temperature was not related to trout survival in either network, possibly because the majority of sites were thermally suitable. A similar analytical approach can be useful for inferring survival rates when count data are available over space and time but individual tagging is not feasible.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0706-652X	1205-7533		WOS:000338999600006

While several sources cite soils and sediments as the predominant sink for AgNPs in natural environments, few studies contribute to risk assessment of AgNPs in terrestrial environments. In this study, the effect of AgNPs ([Ag](total): 1-100 mg/kg, 15-50 nm with 0-90% polyvinylpyrrolidone [PVP] capping agent) on soil denitrification processes was investigated with batch kinetic experiments using well-characterized AgNPs. Although the effects on denitrification kinetics and equilibrium end-points were variable among the AgNPs, denitrification kinetics were limited under certain conditions (e. g., PVP-coated AgNPs >= 10 mg/kg). In assessing the impact of AgNPs on ecosystem processes, it is important to consider the interactions of AgNPs with soils and sediments in addition to the physicochemical properties (size, coating agents, sedimentation rate, solubility, surface charge properties, dispersibility) of AgNPs.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0047-2425	1537-2537		WOS:000339273000032	25603089

A variety of electrical and non-electrical forces have been demonstrated to continuously capture and enrich particles in microfluidic devices. This work presents an experimental study of the development of particle trapping in an asymmetric ratchet microchannel under dc-biased ac electric fields. The dc/ac dielectrophoretic accumulation of particles in the first pair of ratchets and the dc electrokinetic shifting of particles into the second and subsequent ratchets are studied, which are found to depend on the particle moving direction with respect to the asymmetric ratchets. The dielectrophoretically trapped particles are eventually patterned into triangular zones in all but the first pair of ratchets for both the forward and backward motions. This developing process of particle trapping can be qualitatively simulated by modifying the channel geometry in the computational domain to mimic the particle chains/clusters formed in the ratchets.									4	0	0	2	0	4			0960-1317	1361-6439		WOS:000338918600007		
J	Cordis, Adriana S.; Warren, Patrick L.								Sunshine as disinfectant: The effect of state Freedom of Information Act laws on public corruption								JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS				115				18	36		10.1016/j.jpubeco.2014.03.010			JUL 2014	2014	We assess the effect of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) laws on public corruption in the United States. Specifically, we investigate the impact of switching from a weak to a strong state-level FOIA law on corruption convictions of state and local government officials. The evidence suggests that strengthening FOIA laws has two offsetting effects: reducing corruption and increasing the probability that corrupt acts are detected. The conflation of these two effects led prior work to find little impact of FOIA on corruption. We find that conviction rates approximately double after the switch, which suggests an increase in detection probabilities. However, conviction rates decline from this new elevated level as the time since the switch from weak to strong FOIA increases. This decline is consistent with officials reducing the rate at which they commit corrupt acts by about 20%. These changes are more pronounced in states with more intense media coverage, for those that had more substantial changes in their FOIA laws, for FOIA laws which include strong liabilities for officials who contravene them, for local officials, and for more serious crimes. Conviction rates of federal officials, who are not subject to the policy, show no concomitant change. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Acylation in trypanosomatids: an essential process and potential drug target								TRENDS IN PARASITOLOGY				30	7			350	360		10.1016/j.pt.2014.05.003			JUL 2014	2014	Fatty acylation-the addition of fatty acid moieties such as myristate and palmitate to proteins-is essential for the survival, growth, and infectivity of the trypanosomatids: Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Leishmania. Myristoylation and palmitoylation are critical for parasite growth, targeting and localization, and the intrinsic function of some proteins. The trypanosomatids possess a single N-myristoyltransferase (NMT) and multiple palmitoyl acyltransferases, and these enzymes and their protein targets are only now being characterized. Global inhibition of either process leads to cell death in trypanosomatids, and genetic ablation of NMT compromises virulence. Moreover, NMT inhibitors effectively cure T. brucei infection in rodents. Thus, protein acylation represents an attractive target for the development of new trypanocidal drugs.									9	0	0	9	0	9			1471-4922	1471-5007		WOS:000339040400007	24954795

This paper: (i) provides the first evidence using gravity equations of both intensive and extensive (goods) margins being affected by ElAs employing a panel data set with a large number of country pairs, product categories, and ElAs from 1962 to 2000; (ii) provides the first evidence of the differential (partial) effects of various "types" of ElAs on these intensive and extensive margins of trade; and (iii) finds a novel differential "timing" of the two margins' (partial) effects with intensive-margin effects occurring sooner than extensive-margin effects, consistent with recent theoretical predictions. The results are robust to correcting for potential sample-selection, firm-heterogeneity, and reverse causality biases. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We developed nanoparticles (NPs) to target degraded elastic lamina, a consistent pathological feature in vascular diseases. In-vitro organ and cell culture experiments demonstrated that these NPs were not taken up by cells, but instead retained within the extracellular space; NP binding was proportional to the extent of elastic lamina damage. With three well-established rodent models of vascular diseases such as aortic aneurysm (calcium chloride mediated aortic injury in rats), atherosclerosis (fat-fed apoE-/- mice), and vascular calcification (warfarin + vitamin K injections in rats), we show precise NPs spatial targeting to degraded vascular elastic lamina while sparing healthy vasculature when NPs were delivered systemically. Nanoparticle targeting degraded elastic lamina is attractive to deliver therapeutic or imaging agents to the diseased vasculature.From the Clinical Editor: This novel work focuses on nanoparticle targeting of degraded elastic lamina in a variety of diseases, including atherosclerosis, vascular calcification, and aneurysm formation, and demonstrates the feasibility to deliver therapeutic or imaging agents to the diseased vasculature.

Controlling retrograde flows could improve patient outcomes. Using a patient-specific model within a Fontan mock circulatory system with respiration, we inserted a valve into the IVC to examine its effects on local hemodynamics while varying retrograde volumes by changing vascular impedances. A bovine valved conduit reduced IVC retrograde flow to within 3% of antegrade flow in all cases. The valve closed only under conditions supporting retrograde flow and its effects on local hemodynamics increased with larger retrograde volume. Liver and TCPC pressures improved only when the valve leaflets were closed whereas cycle-averaged pressures improved only slightly (<1 mm Hg). Increased pulmonary vascular resistance raised mean circulation pressures, but the valve functioned and cardiac output improved and stabilized. Power loss across the TCPC improved by 12%-15% (p < 0.05) with a valve. The effectiveness of valve therapy is dependent on patient vascular impedance.									4	0	0	1	0	4			1058-2916	1538-943X		WOS:000338777600007	24814833

Evaluation of Soybean Germplasm Accessions for Resistance to Phakopsora pachyrhizi Populations in the Southeastern United States, 2009-2012								CROP SCIENCE				54	4			1673	1689		10.2135/cropsci2013.08.0513			JUL-AUG 2014	2014	Between 2009 and 2012, 118 soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] accessions from the USDA Soybean Germplasm Collection were screened for resistance to soybean rust (Phakopsora pachyrhizi) at up to five locations in the southeastern United States. In 2009, plant introductions (PIs) from maturity groups III through IX were evaluated for relative disease severity and intensity of sporulation from uredinia compared with 12 susceptible cultivars from the same range of maturity groups. Resistance evaluations were based primarily on disease severity and intensity of sporulation from rust pustules. To assess resistance at several nurseries, a rust index score was calculated from the severity and sporulation ratings. Many of the PIs were moderately to highly resistant at the 2009 locations between Alabama and South Carolina, but the P. pachyrhizi population in Bossier City, LA, was virulent on most of those accessions. The 2011 rating data from Quincy, FL, indicated an increase in the virulence of the pathogen there since 2009, and this trend was observed again in 2012. In contrast, many of the same PIs developed substantially less soybean rust in Attapulgus, GA, in 2012. Despite the comparatively greater disease that many accessions had in Louisiana in 2009 and in Quincy in 2011 and 2012, at least 78 PIs were resistant in Georgia in 2012, and 20 of those were at least moderately resistant in both Florida and Georgia that year. No accessions were immune to rust at all of the nurseries, but PI 200492 (Rpp1), PI 547875 (a backcross line with Rpp1), and PI 567102B (Rpp6) were the most resistant of the accessions with named resistance genes and were among the most resistant accessions overall. Among the most resistant accessions with unknown resistance genes, PI 416826A, PI 417125, PI 567034, and PI 567104B consistently had effective levels of resistance in different locations and years. Information about the most resistant PIs and their reactions to soybean rust infection across years and locations will be useful for the development of rust-resistant soybean cultivars in the United States.									8	0	0	8	0	8			0011-183X	1435-0653		WOS:000338773100037

We identified a range of companion positions, from "pseudo-surrogacy" (companion speaking as if the patient were not able to speak for himself), "hearsay", "conflation of thoughts", "co-experiencing", "observation as an outsider", and "facilitation". Statements made by companions were infrequently directly validated by the patient.Conclusion: Companions often spoke on behalf of patients during discussions of prognosis and treatment choices, even when the patient was present and capable of speaking on his or her own behalf.

J	Schwindaman, Jeffrey P.; Castle, James W.; Rodgers, John H., Jr.								Fate and distribution of arsenic in a process-designed pilot-scale constructed wetland treatment system								ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING				68				251	259		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2014.03.049			JUL 2014	2014	The fate and distribution of arsenic in simulated groundwater was determined in a pilot-scale constructed wetland treatment system (CWTS) designed to promote specific biogeochemical processes for arsenic removal. Two CWTS series were designed to promote co-precipitation and sorption of arsenic with iron oxyhydroxides under oxidizing conditions, and two series were designed to promote precipitation of arsenic with sulfide and co-precipitation of arsenic with iron sulfide under reducing conditions. Measured conditions in the CWTS were within ranges favorable for the targeted processes. Arsenic removal was significantly greater (alpha = 0.05) in an oxidizing series amended with zero-valent iron (ZVI) than in the other series, with removal extents, efficiencies, and rate coefficients ranging from 6 to 79 mu g L-1, 40 to 95%, and 0.13 to 0.77 d(-1), respectively. The majority of inflow arsenic retained in the first reactor of each series partitioned to the sediment (88-99%), while the remainder partitioned to Typha latifolia. A greater percentage of inflow arsenic was retained in the sediment of the first reactor of the two oxidizing series (20 and 13%) than in the first reactor of the two reducing series (6 and 7%). Addition of ZVI enhanced arsenic removal from the aqueous phase in both oxidizing series and reducing series and increased the percentage of inflow arsenic partitioned to sediment. A vertical concentration gradient developed over time in the sediment, with 74-85% of sediment-bound arsenic accumulated in the upper 6 cm and the remaining percentage below 6 cm. Results from this study demonstrate that a CWTS can decrease the concentration of arsenic in simulated groundwater to below the World Health Organization (WHO) drinking water quality guideline of 10 mu g L-1 primarily by transferring arsenic from the aqueous phase to the sediment.

J	Harp, Nancy; Myring, Mark; Shortridge, Rebecca Toppe								Do Variations in the Strength of Corporate Governance Still Matter? A Comparison of the Pre- and Post-Regulation Environment								JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS				122	3			361	373		10.1007/s10551-013-1749-4			JUL 2014	2014	Corporate scandals brought the issue of corporate governance to the forefront of the agendas of lawmakers and regulators in the early 2000s. As a result, Congress, the New York Stock Exchange, and the NASDAQ enacted standards to improve the quality of corporate governance, thereby enhancing the quantity and quality of disclosures by listed companies. We investigate the relationship between corporate governance strength and the quality of disclosures in pre- and post-regulation time periods. If cross-sectional differences in corporate governance policies affect the quality of financial disclosures, the quality of information available to analysts varies with such policies. Specifically, higher quality disclosures, produced as a result of strong corporate governance, should lead to more accurate and less dispersed analysts' forecasts. Our analysis suggests that voluntary implementation of stronger corporate governance enhanced the quality of disclosures in the pre-regulation period; however, exceeding current corporate governance standards does not appear to result in higher quality disclosures post-regulation. These results suggest that SOX and the stronger regulations enacted by U.S. exchanges were effective in reducing variation in the quality of financial information available to investors.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0167-4544	1573-0697		WOS:000338538000001

In the present study, a simple procedure that can not only significantly increase the heterologous cell fusion but is also capable of producing fused cells on a large scale is reported. A biotin-streptavidin-biotin (BSB) bridge was created by coating one to-be-fused cell with biotin and the other with biotin-streptavidin. The BSB bridge enhances cell-fusion rates induced with PEG fusion or electrofusion by 10-30% depending on the cell types when compared with cell fusions without the bridge. The procedure described increases heterologous cell pairing and eliminates the alignment step required for the majority of electrofusions. Notably, it can be used to make large-scale cell fusions for clinical applications.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1792-1074	1792-1082		WOS:000338179100036

Creeping Bentgrass Field Response to Pigment-Containing Products								AGRONOMY JOURNAL				106	4			1533	1539		10.2134/agronj14.0008			JUL-AUG 2014	2014	Reducing summer stress on creeping bentgrass [Agrostis stolonifera L. var. palustris (Huds.)] putting greens is a major goal of many turf managers. Use of colorants and pigment-containing products has been proposed as a means of protecting the plant from environmental stress, especially on bentgrass putting greens grown in heat-stressed environments. The objective of this research was to investigate the physiological effects of four pigment-containing products-a combination of zinc oxide (ZnO), green pigment, and titanium dioxide (TiO2) (TurfScreen); Cu-based pigments (PAR and Foursome); and a Cu-pigmented paint designed to provide green color to dormant turfgrass in winter months-have on creeping bentgrass under stressful field conditions. Products were applied weekly for 10 wk to two separate studies repeated in time. TurfScreen, PAR, Foursome, and paint all lowered carbon dioxide exchange rate (CER), reduced normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and raised canopy temperature relative to nontreated controls. Only paint lowered visual quality and percent turf cover compared to the untreated controls. TurfScreen reduced evapotranspiration (ET) in one of two studies. Root mass was unaffected by any treatment. Zinc (similar to 800 mg kg(-1)) and Cu (>155 mg kg(-1)) concentrations in leaf tissue and soil increased dramatically after TurfScreen and paint application, respectively, and potential toxicity should be considered during long-term use of these products. The products tested failed to enhance physiological processes normally associated with improved turf health and quality.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0002-1962	1435-0645		WOS:000338432200047

The antimicrobial substance(s) was named jenseniin P and L. delbrueckii ssp. lactis ATCC 4797 was thereafter used as the indicator strain in subsequent research. In current study, production of jenseniin P was significantly enhanced via an improved fed-batch fermentation method and was partially purified using reverse phase silica gel (C18). This partially purified jenseniin P was inactivated by trypsin, pronase, and proteinase K. The molecular weight of jenseniin P was determined to be between 4.5 and 5 kDa. Jenseniin P was characterized as being pH stable with partial inactivation at 100 A degrees C. Jenseniin P was determined to be bactericidal, causing 2.38 log reduction within 60 min at room temperature. A new bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (BLIS) produced by P. jensenii B1264 was discovered in this study. The new BLIS inhibited the growth of Propionibacterium acnes ATCC 6919 but not the previously used indicator strain L. lactis ATCC 4797. The new discovered BLIS was recovered from the 30 % acetonitrile elution fraction of C18 resin silica column purification process. This new BLIS might present new potential application in the pharmaceutical industry for acne treatment.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1438-2377	1438-2385		WOS:000338224600009		
J	He, Lliin; Cornelius, Chris J.; Perahia, Dvora								Water dynamics within a highly rigid sulfonated polyphenylene								EUROPEAN POLYMER JOURNAL				56				168	173		10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2014.03.035			JUL 2014	2014	Complex water molecule interactions within the confined environments of a sulfonated polyphenylene (sPP) ionomer were studied using H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Multiple water environments were observed due to variations in hydrophilicity created by its structure, and chemical composition. Confined water properties are strongly dependent upon water content, degree of ionization, and temperature. Increasing the degree of sulfonation (DS) results in the creation of more water states and sites. The chemical shifts of water depend upon its environment with a smaller dependence on temperature. Confined water relaxation time T-1 is than significantly lower bulk water and increases with temperature. Pulse field gradient (PFG) NMR studies reveals that water self-diffusion coefficients increase with. Water molecules diffuse faster in sPP than Nafion, which implies that diffusion is facilitated by bundled hydrophilic pathways. Time-dependent FTIR reveals that bound water evaporates slower than unbound water during drying, which illustrates the difference of bulk and confined water within sPP ionomers. Hindered water evaporation is due to a reduction in the degrees of freedom for ion containing domains and mass transfer limitations at interfacial boundaries between hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains.

Two quadrature hybrids are utilized to achieve destructive interference that eliminates the probing signals at both measurement ports. As a result, weak signals of material-under-test (MUT) are elevated for high sensitivity detections at different frequencies. The sensor is demonstrated through measuring 2-propanol-water solution permittivity at 0.01 mole fraction concentration level from similar to 4 GHz to similar to 12 GHz. De-ionized water and methanol-water solution are used to calibrate the sensor for quantitative MUT analysis through our proposed model. Micro-meter coplanar waveguides (CPW) are fabricated as RF sensing electrodes. A polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic channel is employed to introduce 250 nL liquid, of which similar to 1 nL is effectively the MUT. The permittivity and the relaxation time of 2-propanol-water solution are obtained. Compared with our power divider based sensors, the differential reflection coefficients in this work provide additional information that complements the transmission coefficient methods.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1531-1309	1558-1764		WOS:000338355000020	25197266

Construction and expression of mutagenesis strain of aroG gene from Escherichia coli K-12								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES				68				173	177		10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2014.04.034			JUL 2014	2014	3-Deoxy-D-arabino-heptulonate-7-phosphate (DAHP) synthase is one of the key enzymes, which catalyzes the first step in the aromatic amino acid biosynthetic pathway and yields the three amino acids tyrosine (Tyr), tryptophan (Typ), and phenylalanine (Phe). In Escherichia coli (E. coli), three differently regulated DAHP synthases carry out the first regulated step in the aromatic amino acid biosynthetic pathway. The three DAHP synthases encoded by the genes aroG, aroF, and aroH are inhibited by phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan, respectively. In this work, the aroG gene was cloned and mutated by site-directed mutagenesis using overlap extension PCR (SOE-PCR) technique. The feedback-resistant DAHP synthase encoded by aroG was achieved by replacing the residue Pro150 of aroG with Leu as to increase net carbon flow down the common pathway. SDS-PAGE and Western blots were used to assess the protein expression level of aroGM which showed the strain harboring the mutated aroGM150 gene achieving over-expression compared to the strain containing an empty plasmid pET-28b((+)).

The near-infrared (1.5 mu m) luminescence properties were evaluated as a function of Er3+ concentration. Judd-Ofelt intensity parameters, radiative rates, branching ratios, and emission lifetimes were determined and compared with results reported for Er3+-doped Y2O3 single crystal and nanocrystals. Following pumping at 1.532 mu m, weak blue (similar to 0.41 mu m, H-2(9/2) -> I-4(15/2)), strong green (similar to 0.56 mu m, H-2(11/2), S-4(3/2) -> I-4(15/2)), and red (similar to 0.67 mu m, F-4(9/2) -> I-4(15/2)) emission bands were observed as well as weak near-infrared emissions at 0.8 mu m (I-4(9/2) -> I-4(15/2)) and 0.85 mu m (S-4(3/2) -> I-4(13/2)) at room temperature. The upconversion luminescence properties under similar to 1.5 mu m pumping were further investigated through pump power dependence and decay time studies. Sequential two-photon absorption leads to the I-4(9/2) upconversion emission, whereas energy-transfer upconversion is responsible for the emission from the higher excited states H-2(9/2), H-2(11/2), S-4(3/2), and F-4(9/2). The enhanced red emission with increasing Er3+ concentration most likely occurred via the cross-relaxation process between (F-4(7/2) -> F-4(9/2)) and (I-4(11/2) -> F-4(9/2)) transitions, which increased the population of the F-4(9/2) level.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000338126800018

In this study, we inspected the effects of substrate stiffness on human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) derived from adult human bone marrow differentiation into adipogenic and osteogenic cells. A chemically modified extracellular matrix derived and highly biocompatible hydrogel, based on thiol functionalized hyaluronic acid (HA-SH) and thiol functionalized recombinant human gelatin (Gtn-SH), which can be crosslinked by poly (ethylene glycol) tetra-acrylate (PEGTA), was used as a model system. The stiffness of the hydrogel was controlled by adjusting the crosslinking density. Human bone marrow MSCs were cultured on the hydrogels with different stiffness under adipogenic and osteogenic conditions. Oil Red O staining and F-actin staining were applied to assess the change of cell morphologies under adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation, respectively. Gene expression of cells was determined with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as a function of hydrogel stiffness. Results support the hypothesis that adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs are inclined to occur on substrate with stiffness similar to their in vivo microenvironments.

A hybrid ultra-filtration/equilibrium dialysis, ligand exchange technique was used to generate the partitioning data. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was used as a reference ligand to allow the aqueous chemistry of the Pu(IV)-HA system to be examined over a range of pH values, while minimizing the possibility of precipitation of Pu(IV). The conditional stability constant for Pu(IV) complexation with HA determined as part of this work is log beta(112) = 6.76 +/- 0.14 based on the equation: Pu4+ + HL3 + 2H(2)O <-> Pu(OH)(2)L3(+) + 3H(+) where HA is represented by HL3 (a binding site on the HA with a pK(a) value of 7). This value is three orders of magnitude higher than the Th(IV)-HA constant and between six and eight orders of magnitude higher than the Np(V)-HA complex. The magnitude of the stability constants and the general trend of increasing complexation strength with increasing pH is consistent with previous observations.The Pu(IV)-HA stability constants were used to model sorption of Pu(IV) to gibbsite in the presence of HA. Assuming only aqueous Pu-HA complexes and AlOH-Pu surface complexes, the model was unable to predict the observed data which exhibited greater sorption at pH 4 relative to pH 6; a phenomenon which does not occur in the absence of HA. Therefore, this study demonstrates that ternary Pu-HA-gibbsite complexes may form under low pH conditions and exhibit greater sorption than that observed in the absence of HA. Although the presence of HA may increase the solubility/aqueous concentrations of Pu in the absence of a solid phase, formation of ternary complexes may indeed retard the subsurface migration of Pu. The corollary to this finding is that increased mobility may occur if the ternary surface complex forms on a mobile colloid rather than part of the subsurface matrix									6	0	0	5	0	6			0033-8230			WOS:000338491000008

Unfortunately, the actual implementation of such devices in their respective environment has been hindered by the lack of scalable energy sources that are necessary to power and maintain them. Batteries, which remain the most commonly used power sources, have not kept pace with the demands of these devices, especially in terms of energy density. In light of this challenge, the concept of vibratory energy harvesting has flourished in recent years as a possible alternative to provide a continuous power supply. While linear vibratory energy harvesters have received the majority of the literature's attention, a significant body of the current research activity is focused on the concept of purposeful inclusion of nonlinearities for broadband transduction. When compared to their linear resonant counterparts, nonlinear energy harvesters have a wider steady-state frequency bandwidth, leading to a common belief that they can be utilized to improve performance in ambient environments. Through a review of the open literature, this paper highlights the role of nonlinearities in the transduction of energy harvesters under different types of excitations and investigates the conditions, in terms of excitation nature and potential shape, under which such nonlinearities can be beneficial for energy harvesting.									86	8	0	2	0	93			0003-6900			WOS:000337909500002

Loneliness and Mortality Among Older Adults in China								JOURNALS OF GERONTOLOGY SERIES B-PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES				69	4			633	645		10.1093/geronb/gbu007			JUL 2014	2014	Objectives. To examine the relationships between loneliness, social and health behaviors, health, and mortality among older adults in China.Method. Data came from a nationally representative sample of 14,072 adults aged 65 and older from the 2002, 2005, and 2008 waves of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey. A cross-lagged model combined with survival analysis was used to assess the relationships between loneliness, behavioral and health outcomes, and risk of mortality.Results. About 28% of older Chinese adults reported feeling lonely, and lonely adults faced increased risks of dying over the subsequent years. Some of the effect was explained by social and health behaviors, but most of the effect was explained by health outcomes. Loneliness both affects and is affected by social activities, solitary leisure activities, physical exercise, emotional health, self-rated health, and functional limitations over a 3-year period.Discussion. Loneliness is part of a constellation of poor social, emotional, and health outcomes for Chinese older adults. Interventions to increase the social involvement of lonely individuals may improve well-being and lengthen life.									16	2	0	6	0	18			1079-5014	1758-5368		WOS:000338009000015	24550354

GPS Visitor Tracking and Recreation Suitability Mapping: Tools for understanding and managing visitor use								LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING				127				136	145		10.1016/j.landurbplan.2014.04.002			JUL 2014	2014	Understanding space in parks and protected areas is becoming more important as recreation and other uses in these areas change and increase. Spatial demand and space utility are of particular importance to multiple-use forests, which may have competing demands and limited acreage. For managers to balance the demands of society, maintain healthy ecosystems, and generate revenue these demands must be integrated on some level. Spatial data and analysis can help with integration; however, social science data can be difficult to integrate into spatial modeling and analysis. This study examined the integration of two mapping methods that can assist in the incorporation of social science data into spatial models: Recreation Suitability Mapping (RSM) and GPS Visitor Tracking (GVT). Visitor use preferences were spatially mapped to create recreation suitability models for competing recreation activity groups, and GPS tracking of visitor use was used to compare and contrast actual user patterns with mapped preferences. Combining RSM and GVT proved useful for informing visitor management in a small acreage, multi-use public forest experiencing high spatial demand. Theoretical, methodological, and practical implications are discussed. Published by Elsevier B.V.									4	0	0	2	0	4			0169-2046	1872-6062		WOS:000337878700014

These programs have traditionally used observed or predicted disease and pathogen data and environmental information to prescribe management practices that minimize crop loss (3,69). Monitoring programs are especially important for crops with broad geographic distribution or for diseases that can cause rapid and great economic losses. Successful monitoring programs have been developed for several plant diseases, including downy mildew of cucurbits, Fusarium head blight of wheat, potato late blight, and rusts of cereal crops (13,36,51,80).A recent example of a successful disease-monitoring program for an economically important crop is the soybean rust (SBR) monitoring effort within North America. SBR, caused by the fungus Phakopsora pachyrhizi Sydow, was first identified in the continental United States in November 2004 (59; Sidebar 1: Soybean rust disease cycle). SBR causes moderate to severe yield losses globally (6,25,42,54). The fungus produces foliar lesions on soybean (Glycine max Merrill) and other legume hosts. P. pachyrhizi diverts nutrients from the host to its own growth and reproduction. The lesions also reduce photosynthetic area. Uredinia rupture the host epidermis and diminish stomatal regulation of transpiration to cause tissue desiccation and premature defoliation (Fig. 1) (6). Severe soybean yield losses can occur if plants defoliate during the mid-reproductive growth stages (25,38).Since 2004, soybean has been produced on approximately 30 million hectares annually in the United States, with a value between $18 billion and $32 billion (74). Therefore, the threat of this destructive disease warranted the attention of farmers, agricultural industries, university scientists, and national and state/provincial governmental agencies. The rapid response to the threat of SBR in North America resulted in an unprecedented amount of information dissemination and the development of a real-time, publicly available monitoring and prediction system known as the Soybean Rust-Pest Information Platform for Extension and Education (SBR-PIPE). Several comprehensive reviews of SBR and the SBR-PIPE were published (6,21,23,29,33,79). The objectives of this article are (i) to highlight the successful response effort to SBR in North America, and (ii) to introduce researchers to the quantity and type of data generated by SBR-PIPE. Data from this system may now be used to answer questions about the biology, ecology, and epidemiology of an important pathogen and disease of soybean.									6	0	0	4	0	6			0191-2917	1943-7692		WOS:000337714700001

Bullying in the Digital Age: A Critical Review and Meta-Analysis of Cyberbullying Research Among Youth								PSYCHOLOGICAL BULLETIN				140	4			1073	1137		10.1037/a0035618			JUL 2014	2014	Although the Internet has transformed the way our world operates, it has also served as a venue for cyberbullying, a serious form of misbehavior among youth. With many of today's youth experiencing acts of cyberbullying, a growing body of literature has begun to document the prevalence, predictors, and outcomes of this behavior, but the literature is highly fragmented and lacks theoretical focus. Therefore, our purpose in the present article is to provide a critical review of the existing cyberbullying research. The general aggression model is proposed as a useful theoretical framework from which to understand this phenomenon. Additionally, results from a meta-analytic review are presented to highlight the size of the relationships between cyberbullying and traditional bullying, as well as relationships between cyberbullying and other meaningful behavioral and psychological variables. Mixed effects meta-analysis results indicate that among the strongest associations with cyberbullying perpetration were normative beliefs about aggression and moral disengagement, and the strongest associations with cyberbullying victimization were stress and suicidal ideation. Several methodological and sample characteristics served as moderators of these relationships. Limitations of the meta-analysis include issues dealing with causality or directionality of these associations as well as generalizability for those meta-analytic estimates that are based on smaller sets of studies (k < 5). Finally, the present results uncover important areas for future research. We provide a relevant agenda, including the need for understanding the incremental impact of cyberbullying (over and above traditional bullying) on key behavioral and psychological outcomes.									125	2	0	15	1	128			0033-2909	1939-1455		WOS:000337916400006	24512111

Recommendations for dispatching emergency vehicles under multitiered response via simulation								INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS IN OPERATIONAL RESEARCH				21	4			581	617		10.1111/itor.12083			JUL 2014	2014	Emergency medical service (EMS) systems provide medical care and transportation. While many real-world systems use multiple vehicle types to attend different call priorities, few guidelines exist about which vehicles to allocate in multitiered responses where more than one vehicle is sent per call. This paper makes recommendations for multiple-unit dispatch to multiple call priorities based on simulation optimization and heuristics. The objective is to maximize the overall expected survival probability of patients classified as "life-threatening". We assume two types of medical units and three call priorities; and that information may be updated when the medical unit arrives on-scene. First, we study the optimal dispatching policies through several examples. Numerical results show that dispatching while considering call priorities, rather than dispatching the closest units, improves EMS system effectiveness. A heuristic algorithm is developed for large-scale problems. A comparison between the heuristic and closest policy is demonstrated using real-world data.									2	0	0	0	1	3			0969-6016	1475-3995		WOS:000337697200004

Transcriptional regulators transforming growth factor-beta 1 and estrogen-related receptor-alpha identified as putative mediators of calf rumen epithelial tissue development and function during weaning								JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE				97	7			4193	4207		10.3168/jds.2013-7471			JUL 2014	2014	Molecular mechanisms regulating rumen epithelial development remain largely unknown. To identify gene networks and regulatory factors controlling rumen development, Holstein bull calves (n = 18) were fed milk replacer only (MRO) until 42 d of age. Three calves each were euthanized at 14 and 42 d of age for tissue collection to represent preweaning, and the remaining calves were provided diets of either milk replacer + or-chard grass hay (MH; n = 6) to initiate weaning without development of rumen papillae, or milk replacer + calf starter (MG; n = 6) to initiate weaning and development of rumen papillae. At 56 and 70 d of age, 3 calves from the MH and MG groups were euthanized for collection of rumen epithelium. Total RNA and protein were extracted for microarray analysis and to validate detected changes in selected protein expression, respectively. As expected, calves fed MRO had no rumen papillae and development of papillae was greater in MG versus MH calves. Differentially expressed genes between the MRO diet at d 42 (preweaning) versus the MG or MH diets at d 56.(during weaning) were identified using permutation analysis of differential expression. Expression of 345 and 519 transcripts was uniquely responsive to MG and MH feeding, respectively. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Qiagen, Redwood City, CA) indicated that the top-ranked biological function affected by the MG diet was the cell cycle, and TFGB1, FBOX01, and PPARA were identified as key transcriptional regulators of genes responsive to the MG diet and associated with development of rumen papillae. Increased expressions of TGFB1 mRNA and protein in response to the MG diet were confirmed by subsequent analyses. The top-ranking biological function affected by the MH diet was energy production. Receptors for IGF-1 and insulin, ESRRA, and PPARD were identified by ingenuity pathway analysis as transcriptional regulators of genes responsive to the MH diet. Further analysis of TGFB1 and ESRRA mRNA expression in rumen epithelium obtained from a separate ontogenic study of Holstein calves (n = 26) euthanized every 7 d from birth to 42 d of age showed increases in transcript expression with advancing age, supporting their roles in mediating rumen epithelial development and function during weaning. Additional evaluation of gene expression in the rumen epithelium of adult cows ruminally infused with butyrate also suggested that observed changes in ESRRA mRNA expression in developing calf rumen may be mediated by increased butyrate concentration. Our results identify TGFB1 and ESRRA as likely transcriptional regulators of rumen epithelial development and energy metabolism, respectively, and provide targets for modulation of rumen development and function in the growing calf.									8	1	0	7	0	9			0022-0302	1525-3198		WOS:000337656000020	24767884

In this article, we extend this application by examining the effects of the distribution of state and local governments' tax liability on budgetary outcomes. Different tax structures yield vastly different contributions from members of the polity, but all members may influence the draw from the fiscal commons through the political process. We find that when the tax burden is heavier for taxpayers at the top of the income distribution and lighter for taxpayers at the bottom of the income distribution, state and local government expenditures grow, and governments spend more on social welfare. However, we do not find a link between the distribution of tax liability and debt.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0265-5322	1477-0946		WOS:000337571100009

In this study, field isolates that were low-resistant (LR) and moderately resistant (MR) to fludioxonil from blackberry and strawberry fields of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia were characterized. Genes involved in osmoregulation, including bcsak1, BcOS4, bos5, and BRRG-1, were cloned and sequenced to detect potential target gene alterations; however, none were found. A previously described mutation (R632I) in transcription factor Mrr1, which is known to increase the expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter AtrB, was found in MR but not in sensitive (S) or LR isolates. Expression of atrB in MR isolates was approximate to 200-fold increased compared with an S isolate; however, 30- to 100-fold overexpression was also detected in LR isolates. Both MR isolates exhibited increased sensitivity to salt stress in the form of mycelial growth inhibition at 4% NaCl, indicating a disruption of osmoregulatory processes in those strains. However, the glycerol content was indistinguishable between S, LR, and MR isolates with and without exposure to fludioxonil, suggesting that the glycerol synthesis pathway may not be a part of the resistance mechanism in LR or MR strains. An investigation into the origin of LR and MR isolates from blackberry revealed two insertions in the mrr1 gene consistent with those found in the Botrytis clade group S. The emergence of strains overexpressing atrB in European and now in North American strawberry fields underscores the importance of this resistance mechanism for development of resistance to fludioxonil in Botrytis cinerea.									15	0	0	13	0	15			0031-949X	1943-7684		WOS:000337849800006	24423402

Over a follow-up period of up to 12 years, physical examinations and structured interviews were conducted for 201 individuals diagnosed with PMS, 120 patients had a focused, high-resolution 22q12q13 array CGH, and 92 patients' deletions were assessed for parent-of-origin. 22q13 genomic anomalies include terminal deletions of 22q13 (89 %), terminal deletions and interstitial duplications (9 %), and interstitial deletions (2 %). Considering different age groups, in older patients, behavioral problems tended to subside, developmental abilities improved, and some features such as large or fleshy hands, full or puffy eyelids, hypotonia, lax ligaments, and hyperextensible joints were less frequent. However, the proportion reporting an autism spectrum disorder, seizures, and cellulitis, or presenting with lymphedema or abnormal reflexes increased with age. Some neurologic and dysmorphic features such as speech and developmental delay and macrocephaly correlated with deletion size. Deletion sizes in more recently diagnosed patients tend to be smaller than those diagnosed a decade earlier. Seventy-three percent of de novo deletions were of paternal origin. Seizures were reported three times more often among patients with a de novo deletion of the maternal rather than paternal chromosome 22. This analysis improves the understanding of the clinical presentation and natural history of PMS and can serve as a reference for the prevalence of clinical features in the syndrome.									18	0	1	13	0	19			0340-6717	1432-1203		WOS:000337088600002	24481935

However, a mechanistic understanding of the processes that regulate soil C storage in invaded ecosystems remains surprisingly elusive.Here, we studied the impact of the invasion of two noxious nonnative species, Polygonum cuspidatum, which produces recalcitrant litter, and Pueraria lobata, which produces labile litter, on the quantity, molecular composition, and stability of C in the soils they invade.Compared with an adjacent noninvaded old-field, P. cuspidatum-invaded soils exhibited a 26% increase in C, partially through selective preservation of plant polymers. Despite receiving a 22% higher litter input, P. lobata-invaded Pinus stands exhibited a 28% decrease in soil C and a twofold decrease in plant biomarkers, indicating microbial priming of native soil C. The stability of C exhibited an opposite trend: the proportion of C that was resistant to oxidation was 21% lower in P. cuspidatum-invaded soils and 50% higher in P. lobata-invaded soils.Our results highlight the capacity of invasive plants to feed back to climate change by destabilizing native soil C stocks and indicate that environments that promote the biochemical decomposition of plant litter would enhance the long-term storage of soil C. Further, our study highlights the concurrent influence of dominant plant species on both selective preservation and humification of soil organic matter.									22	1	0	20	0	22			0028-646X	1469-8137		WOS:000336970200014	24720813

Evaluation of four steering wheels to determine driver hand placement in a static environment								APPLIED ERGONOMICS				45	4			1187	1195		10.1016/j.apergo.2014.02.008			JUL 2014	2014	While much research exists on occupant packaging both proprietary and in the literature, more detailed research regarding user preferences for subjective ratings of steering wheel designs is sparse in published literature. This study aimed to explore the driver interactions with production steering wheels in four vehicles by using anthropometric data, driver hand placement, and driver grip design preferences for Generation-Y and Baby Boomers. In this study, participants selected their preferred grip diameter, responded to a series of questions about the steering wheel grip as they sat in four vehicles, and rank ordered their preferred grip design. Thirty-two male participants (16 Baby Boomers between ages 47 and 65 and 16 Generation-Y between ages 18 and 29) participated in the study. Drivers demonstrated different gripping behavior between vehicles and between groups. Recommendations for future work in steering wheel grip design and naturalistic driver hand positioning are discussed.

The FDI scheme is applied to actuator and sensor faults in a vehicle chassis steering system described by a nonlinear bicycle model with three degrees of freedom. Primary residual is generated by an expanded SMO designed for linear time varying (LTV) systems. To cope with the multiple faults isolation problem, the state machine records and utilizes the previous fault information to determine the current fault state. Simulation results show that multiple fault detection and isolation can be successfully achieved by the proposed SMO and state-machine-based FDI scheme.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-0434	1528-9028		WOS:000336917200026

Six conserved domains, i.e., heme bL binding sites, heme bH binding sites, Qo binding sites, Qi binding sites, the interchain domain interface, and the intrachain domain interface were found in all investigated sequences. The topology of the phylogenetic trees was largely consistent with the well recognized taxonomic relationships, indicating that the Cyt b genes originated from a common ancestral gene before the divergence of eukaryotic kingdoms. The eukaryotic Cyt b genes likely originated from an ancient prokaryotic gene in Alphaproteobacteria based on shared conserved domains. We provide evidence that the Cyt b gene of oomycete Pseudoperonospora cubensis was horizontally transferred from a fungus in the order Hypocreales. To our knowledge, this is the first reported evidence of Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from Fungi to Chromista involving an essential house-keeping gene. Our data suggest that HGT events must be considered when evolutionary trees are constructed only based on Cyt b genes. Additional analysis of thousands of Cyt b sequences from Genbank revealed that introns in mitochondrial Cyt b genes were acquired after the endosymbiosis of alphaproteobacteria in eukaryotic cells.

J	Bishop, West M.; Johnson, B. M.; Rodgers, J. H., Jr.								Comparative responses of target and nontarget species to exposures of a copper-based algaecide								JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT				52				65	70					JUL 2014	2014	In order for water resource managers to make informed, risk-based decisions for algaecide applications, data are needed regarding the relative sensitivities of targeted algal species and nontarget animal species. The objective of this research was to measure responses of eight target algal species (Ankistrodesmus falcatus Corda, Cymbella tunzida Brebisson, Desmidium sp., Eudorina elegans Ehrenberg, Haematococcus pluvialis Flotow, Microcystis aeruginosa Kutzing, Nostoc punctiforme Kutzing, and Pandorina charkowiensis Korschikov) and five nontarget animal. species (Ceriodaphnia dubia Richard, Daphnia magna Straus, Hyallela azteca Saussure, Lepomis macrochirus Rafinesque, Pimep hales promelas Rafinesque) to exposures of a copper-based algaecide (a.i. copper 5%) in 96-h laboratory toxicity tests. The copper concentrations required to achieve control (i.e. 96-h EC90) of the targeted algae were 110, 120, 180, 200, 620, 630, 720, and 730 mu g/L for C. tumida, A. falcatus, H. pluvialis, P. charkowiensis, E. elegans, N. punctiforme, M. aeruginosa, and Desmidium sp., respectively. For the animal species, the copper concentrations that elicited a 96-h LC50 were 4.6, 48, 250, 390, and 67,000 mu g/L for D. magna, C. dubia, P. promelas, H azteca, and L. macrochirus, respectively. These results indicate a range of sensitivities to copper exposures within and between algal and animal species. Based on the sensitivities of specific target algae at a site, the risks to nontarget species could be significant (i.e. low margin of safety).									0	0	0	0	0	0			0146-6623			WOS:000209567600005		
J	Boyle, M. Forbes, II; Abella, Scott R.; Shelburne, Victor B.								An ecosystem classification approach to assessing forest change in the southern Appalachian Mountains								FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT				323				85	97		10.1016/j.foreco.2014.03.005			JUL 1 2014	2014	Multifactor ecosystem classification systems are designed to identify similar site units across the landscape based on repeating patterns of geomorphology, soil, and vegetation. Ecosystem classification models have been developed for numerous forest landscapes in North America and elsewhere, but few studies have employed multifactor classification techniques across forest disturbance and age gradients. With its myriad of landforms and history of logging, the 17,604-ha Jocassee Gorges tract in upstate South Carolina of the southern Appalachian Mountains, USA, represents an ideal landscape to examine both spatial and temporal variability in vegetation-environment relationships. We examined a dual ecosystem and forest-age gradient, including five ecosystem types (ranging from xeric, upland Quercus ecosystems to moist, Tsuga canadensis ecosystems) and four forest-age classes (5-25, 26-50, 51-70, and >70 years old) within ecosystems. On 111 replicate 0.1-ha plots across the gradient, we sampled species composition of tree and ground-flora stratum, which we analyzed using permutation and ordination multivariate techniques. Overall differences in species composition for both strata occurred among ecosystems within all forest ages, and differentiation among ecosystems strengthened as forests aged. Age-related variation was evident within an ecosystem type for several ecosystems, but was generally weaker than variation among ecosystems. Ground flora was generally most sensitive to the age and ecosystem gradient, but the tree stratum also differed among age classes and several ecosystems. Forest composition across this landscape was filtered primarily by distribution of ecosystems serving as the physical template and secondarily by forest ages within ecosystems. Application of ecosystem classification to the full range of forest ages on the landscape also illuminated numerous considerations for forest management, such as a finding that of the three Quercus ecosystems on the landscape, a submesic ecosystem may be least resistant and resilient for maintaining Quercus dominance following logging. Results suggest that effectiveness of ecological classification systems as tools for landscape-scale management is enhanced when they include both spatial and temporal heterogeneity among ecosystem units.

The existing analytical models assume a homogeneous soil profile, where the thermal properties of the ground along the entire length of the heat exchanger are uniform. This assumption can be unreliable since the typical length of heat exchangers is 60-100m (200-300 ft.) and stratified ground is expected over this length. In the approach presented herein, the heat exchanger is divided into a number of segments to represent various soil layers along its length. Heat exchange induced temperature change at a certain location within the soil formation is evaluated by summing up the individual contributions of all these segments. The effect of the heat exchanger segment within the soil layer around itself is estimated using the finite line source model. Furthermore, the finite line source model is utilized on transformed sections for estimating the contributions of heat exchanger segments at locations outside their layer domains. The proposed model also incorporates two adjustments; the first accounts for the different heat rates within different soil layers while the second adjustment considers the heat exchange along the vertical direction between soil layers. Estimated results using the proposed model agree well with the results obtained from a calibrated finite element analysis. The proposed procedure is promising and can also be adapted within the framework of cylindrical models. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Our results extend recent results of Petersen. The key elements in the proofs are the A-code and the B-code introduced by Foata and Han. We show that the map B-code(-1) o A-code is a bijection on the set of restricted permutations which sends inv to sor, Rmil to Cyc and preserves the set-valued statistics Lmal and Lmap. We also show analogous equidistribution results for restricted permutations of type B and D by constructing appropriate A-codes and B-codes in each case. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The structure consists of a CO2 laser-induced long period fiber grating (LPFG) and a section of single mode-multimode-single mode (SMS) fiber structure. The LPFG serves as a refractometer with a temperature compensator using a simple SMS fiber structure. The sensing mechanism of this device has been investigated and experimentally demonstrated. The SMS structure was insensitive towards the change in the ambient RI but was sensitive towards the changes in the ambient temperature whereas the LPFG was sensitive towards both. A sensitivity matrix was built to compensate the temperature RI crosstalk. The capability of simultaneous measurement of temperature and RI of the sensor was experimentally validated.

It is well-known that there exists a self-dual normal basis of F-2(n) over F-2 if and only if 4 dagger n. In this paper, we prove that there exists a normal element alpha of F-2(n)= over F-2 corresponding to a prescribed vector a = (a(0), a(1), . . . , a(n-1)) is an element of F-2(n) such that a(i) = Tr-2(n)vertical bar 2(alpha(1+22)) for 0 <= i <= n - 1, where n is a 2-power or odd, if and only if the given vector a is symmetric (a(i) = a(n-i) for all i, 1 <= i <= n-1), and one of the following is true.[GRAPHICS]Furthermore we give an algorithm to obtain normal elements corresponding to prescribed vectors in the above two cases. For a general positive integer n with 4 vertical bar n, some necessary conditions for a vector to be the corresponding vector of a normal element of F-2(n) over F-2 are given. And for all n with 4 vertical bar n, we prove that there exists a normal element of F-2(n) over F-2 such that the Hamming weight of its corresponding vector is 3, which is the lowest possible Hamming weight.

Shape Readout of AT-Rich DNA by Carbohydrates								BIOPOLYMERS				101	7			720	732		10.1002/bip.22448			JUL 2014	2014	Gene expression can be altered by small molecules that target DNA; sequence as well as shape selectivities are both extremely important for DNA recognition by intercalating and groove-binding ligands. We have characterized a carbohydrate scaffold (1) exhibiting DNA shape readout properties. Thermodynamic studies with 1 and model duplex DNAs demonstrate the molecule's high affinity and selectivity towards B* form (continuous AT-rich) DNA. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), circular dichroism (CD) titration, ultraviolet (UV) thermal denaturation, and Differential Scanning Calorimetry were used to characterize the binding of 1 with a B* form AT-rich DNA duplex d[5-G(2)A(6)T(6)C(2)-3]. The binding constant was determined using ITC at various temperatures, salt concentrations, and pH. ITC titrations were fit using a two-binding site model. The first binding event was shown to have a 1:1 binding stoichiometry and was predominantly entropy-driven with a binding constant of approximately 10(8) M-1. ITC-derived binding enthalpies were used to obtain the binding-induced change in heat capacity (C-p) of -225 +/- 19 cal/mol<bold>K</bold>. The ionic strength dependence of the binding constant indicated a significant electrolytic contribution in ligand:DNA binding, with approximately four to five ion pairs involved in binding. Ligand 1 displayed a significantly higher affinity towards AT-tract DNA over sequences containing GC inserts, and binding experiments revealed the order of binding affinity for 1 with DNA duplexes: contiguous B* form AT-rich DNA (d[5-G(2)A(6)T(6)C(2)-3]) >B form alternate AT-rich DNA (d[5-G(2)(AT)(6)C(2-)3])>A form GC-rich DNA (d[5-A(2)G(6)C(6)T(2)-3]), demonstrating the preference of ligand 1 for B* form DNA.

Here, we report that family 5 UDGb from Thermus thermophilus HB8 is not only a uracil DNA glycosyase acting on G/U, T/U, C/U, and A/U base pairs, but also a hypoxanthine DNA glycosylase acting on G/I, T/I, and A/I base pairs and a xanthine DNA glycosylase acting on all double-stranded and single-stranded xanthine-containing DNA. Analysis of potentials of mean force indicates that the tendency of hypoxanthine base flipping follows the order of G/I> T/I, A/I> C/I, matching the trend of hypoxanthine DNA glycosylase activity observed in vitro. Genetic analysis indicates that family 5 UDGb can also act as an enzyme to remove uracil incorporated into DNA through the existence of dUTP in the nucleotide pool. Mutational analysis coupled with molecular modeling and molecular dynamics analysis reveals that although hydrogen bonding to O-2 of uracil underlies the UDG activity in a dissociative fashion, Tth UDGb relies on multiple catalytic residues to facilitate its excision of hypoxanthine and xanthine. This study underscores the structural and functional diversity in the UDG superfamily.									5	0	0	4	0	5			0021-9258	1083-351X		WOS:000338042000039	24838246

PLOS ONE				9	6					e98354	10.1371/journal.pone.0098354			JUN 25 2014	2014	Background: Many analyses of HIV treatment decisions assume a fixed formulary of HIV drugs. However, new drugs are approved nearly twice a year, and the rate of availability of new drugs may affect treatment decisions, particularly when to initiate antiretroviral therapy (ART).Objectives: To determine the impact of considering the availability of new drugs on the optimal initiation criteria for ART and outcomes in patients with HIV/AIDS.Methods: We enhanced a previously described simulation model of the optimal time to initiate ART to incorporate the rate of availability of new antiviral drugs. We assumed that the future rate of availability of new drugs would be similar to the past rate of availability of new drugs, and we estimated the past rate by fitting a statistical model to actual HIV drug approval data from 1982-2010. We then tested whether or not the future availability of new drugs affected the model-predicted optimal time to initiate ART based on clinical outcomes, considering treatment initiation thresholds of 200, 350, and 500 cells/mm(3). We also quantified the impact of the future availability of new drugs on life expectancy (LE) and quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE).Results: In base case analysis, considering the availability of new drugs raised the optimal starting CD4 threshold for most patients to 500 cells/mm(3). The predicted gains in outcomes due to availability of pipeline drugs were generally small (less than 1%), but for young patients with a high viral load could add as much as a 4.9% (1.73 years) increase in LE and a 8% (2.43 QALY) increase in QALE, because these patients were particularly likely to exhaust currently available ART regimens before they died. In sensitivity analysis, increasing the rate of availability of new drugs did not substantially alter the results. Lowering the toxicity of future ART drugs had greater potential to increase benefit for many patient groups, increasing QALE by as much as 10%.Conclusions: The future availability of new ART drugs without lower toxicity raises optimal treatment initiation for most patients, and improves clinical outcomes, especially for younger patients with higher viral loads. Reductions in toxicity of future ART drugs could impact optimal treatment initiation and improve clinical outcomes for all HIV patients.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1932-6203			WOS:000338709500004	24963883

Also, we find that the presence of a strong impurity can effectively cut the wire in two and destroy the correlated splitting in both the trivial and the Majorana regimes. We identify a strong nonlocal effect that operates only in the topologically trivial regime and demonstrate that the dependence of the ZBP on the confining gate potential at the opposite end in Majorana wires with two normal metal end contacts represents a powerful tool for discriminating between topologically trivial and nontrivial ZBPs.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1098-0121	1550-235X		WOS:000338639600002

The stars have, on average, either 26 or 40 PS-b-PVP diblock copolymer arms with PS/PVP molecular weight ratios (Sly) of 1/1, 5/1, or 9/1. Preferential adsorption from dilute toluene solutions onto silicon surfaces tethers these topologically complex star copolymers through their PVP blocks, yielding an interfacial structure resembling a dome. The adsorption kinetics are concentration dependent and show two distinct regimes: an initial rapid adsorption is followed by a slow approach toward equilibrium that is dominated by relaxations and rearrangements. For all PS/PVP ratios studied, star copolymers having 40 arms exhibit greater final adsorbed amounts compared to those having 26 arms. A kinetics model that considers diffusion of molecules at the solid/fluid interface as well as surface relaxation/reorganization events is used to characterize the adsorption process. In general, while both processes are necessary to describe the kinetics of preferential adsorption of these materials, surface rearrangements dominate for the two stars having the largest size and number of arms. It is also found that star block copolymers having symmetric arms (PS/PVP = 1/1) approach adsorption equilibrium in agreement with random sequential adsorption (RSA) model kinetics, attaining final adsorbed amounts that are close to those predicted for RSA processes. In contrast, the asymmetric stars having PS/PVP = 9/1 and 5/1 are able to rearrange on the surface, reaching final adsorbed amounts that are greater than those predicted for RSA processes, suggesting surface relaxation/reorganization and possible stretching due to confinement occurring at the solid/fluid interface. The results reported provide key insights as to how composition and connectivity of highly branched soft materials impact their self-assembly and interfacial structure.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0024-9297	1520-5835		WOS:000338089400032

A statistical parsimony network of 71 individuals revealed 71 haplotypes in the COI gene and 43 haplotypes in the COII gene; the concatenated sequences of the COI and COII genes revealed 71 haplotypes. High levels of genetic diversity but low levels of genetic differentiation were observed among populations of S. tani at five elevations. The degree of genetic diversity, however, was not in accordance with an altitudinal gradient, and a Mantel test indicated that elevation did not have a limiting effect on gene flow. No ancestral haplotype of S. tani was found among the populations. Pupae with unique structural characters at the highest elevation showed a tendency to form their own haplotype cluster, as revealed by the COII gene. Tajima's D, Fu's Fs, and mismatch distribution tests revealed population expansion of S. tani in Cameron Highlands. A strong correlation was found between nucleotide diversity and the levels of dissolved oxygen in the streams where S. tani was collected.									5	0	0	2	0	5			1932-6203			WOS:000338508200104	24941043	
J	Roberts, B. C.; Larsen, M. F.								Structure function analysis of chemical tracer trails in the mesosphere-lower thermosphere region								JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES				119	11			6368	6375		10.1002/2013JD020796			JUN 16 2014	2014	Trimethyl aluminum (TMA) trails released from sounding rockets have been used extensively as a tracer of the neutral atmospheric motions in the mesosphere/lower thermosphere region and serve as a tracer of the atmospheric structure in the altitude range where the trails are released. In addition to the bulk motion corresponding to the winds, smaller-scale structure is also evident in the trail images, which can be an indication of turbulence or small-scale wave behavior. In the 90 to 100 km altitude range, the trails are often visible for periods of 20 to 30 min or even longer, so that the horizontal scale sizes spanned by the trails increase significantly as the trails expand due to the combined effects of turbulent diffusion and horizontal displacements due to vertical shears in the winds. We describe a study involving data from high-, middle-, and low-latitude TMA releases. In each case the structure function for the fluctuation structure within the trails was calculated for a sequence of trail images. Each image in the sequence corresponds to an outer horizontal spatial scale that increases with time. By analyzing the time evolution of the structure function, changes in the dynamical processes associated with the form of the structure function have been identified as a function of time and thus also of the increasing horizontal spatial scale size. A consistent pattern is found for all locations, namely a transition in fitted exponent for the structure function that suggests a change from more isotropic turbulence immediately after the trail is released to stratified turbulence at the later times when the horizontal scale size has increased to several hundred kilometers. The transition is found to occur near a horizontal spatial scale in the range between 100 and 200 km.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2169-897X	2169-8996		WOS:000337974500006

We demonstrate, for the first time, a new method using a matched white-light interferometry (MWI) to cancel fiber dispersion and achieve finer temporal resolution, demonstrating similar to 20fs temporal resolution in intermodal delays, i.e. 6 mu m path-length resolution. A 1m-long straight resonantly-enhanced leakage-channel fiber with 100 mu m core was characterized, showing similar to 55fs/m relative group delay and a similar to 29dB mode discrimination between the fundamental and second-order modes.

Error analysis and iterative solvers for Navier-Stokes projection methods with standard and sparse grad-div stabilization								COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING				275				1	19		10.1016/j.cma.2014.02.021			JUN 15 2014	2014	This paper shows that use of a recently introduced sparse grad-div stabilization can increase the accuracy of projection methods for solving the Navier-Stokes equations. Sparse grad-div stabilization has recently been introduced as an alternative to standard grad-div stabilization which has a sparser matrix representation. For both sparse and standard grad-div stabilized projection methods, we prove error estimates and provide numerical experiments which reveal that both stabilizations can cause a significant decrease in the error. We then compare iterative solvers for the linear systems of equations arising from the use of both of the stabilizations. A theoretical analysis of a simplified model problem as well as numerical tests show that iterative solvers perform better for systems arising from sparse grad-div compared to standard grad-div stabilized systems.

Drew								Quantifying clutter: A comparison of four methods and their relationship to bat detection								FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT				322				1	9		10.1016/j.foreco.2014.02.036			JUN 15 2014	2014	The degree of spatial complexity in the environment, or clutter, affects the quality of foraging habitats for bats and their detection with acoustic systems. Clutter has been assessed in a variety of ways but there are no standardized methods for measuring clutter. We compared four methods (Visual Clutter, Cluster, Single Variable, and Clutter Index) and related these to the probability of detecting bat calls. From June to July, 2005-2006, we used Anabat detectors to conduct acoustic surveys for 2-4 nights at each of 71 points representing three visual clutter classes. We used a cluster analysis to identify groups of plots with similar characteristics. We used backwards stepwise discriminant analyses to identify important plot structure variables that differentiated among clutter classes and used discriminant analyses to test the effectiveness of the plot structure variables in classifying plots into visual clutter classes or clusters. Two clutter volume indices (Index(max) and Index(15m)) were computed for each plot by calculating the ratio of vegetation volume to available space in the plot. We assessed the effects of the clutter estimation methods on the probability of detecting bats in low and high frequency phonic groups. Occupancy rates ranged from 0.30 to 0.78 and probability of detecting any bat was >= 0.78 for each period; however, few identifiable calls were recorded. Live tree basal area, midstory live stem count, and canopy crown volume were the most effective measures of clutter for bats because each was a plausible predictor of bat detection and the former two were important for discriminating among plots with differing structure. The use of clutter indices has promise but such methods need to be tested prior to implementation. In future studies of bat foraging habitat, quantitative measures should be used to assess clutter so it is possible to make comparisons among habitats or studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The extension is tested in two cases: (1) simple, low-dimensional anharmonic systems, and (2) on a simple lattice model of vibrations. We show that, for systems where the mode-resolved density of states is well-approximated by a single broadened peak, the fourth-moment approximation works well over a wide range of temperatures.

When designing these systems, the fundamentals of particle design play a key role in the observed specific absorption rate (SAR). This includes the particle's core size, polymer brush length, and colloidal arrangement. While the role of particle core size on the observed SAR has been significantly reported, the role of the polymer brush length has not attracted as much attention. It has recently been reported that for some suspensions linear aggregates form in the presence of an applied external magnetic field, i.e. chains of magnetic particles. The formation of these chains may have the potential for a dramatic impact on the biomedical application of these materials, specifically the efficiency of the particles to transfer magnetic energy to the surrounding cells. In this study we demonstrate the dependence of SAR on magnetite nanoparticle core size and brush length as well as observe the formation of magnetically induced colloidal arrangements. Colloidally stable magnetic nanoparticles were demonstrated to form linear aggregates in an alternating magnetic field. The length and distribution of the aggregates were dependent upon the stabilizing polymer molecular weight. As the molecular weight of the stabilizing layer increased, the magnetic interparticle interactions decreased therefore limiting chain formation. In addition, theoretical calculations demonstrated that interparticle spacing has a significant impact on the magnetic behavior of these materials. This work has several implications for the design of nanoparticle and magnetic hyperthermia systems, while improving understanding of how colloidal arrangement affects SAR.(c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

To date, the optimal end-of-life management of cathode materials is based on economic value and environmental impact which can influence the methods and stage of recycling. Traditional recycling methods can recover high value metal elements (e.g. Li, Co, Ni), but still require synthesis of new cathode from a mix of virgin and recovered materials. Lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) has been selected for study as a representative cathode material due to recent mass adoption and limited economic recycling drivers due to the low inherent cost of iron. Refunctionalization of EOL LiFePO4 cathode was demonstrated through electrochemical and chemical lithiation methods where the re-lithiated LiFePO4 regained the original capacity of 150-155 mAh g(-1). The environmental impact of the new recycling technique was determined by comparing the embodied energy of cathode material originating from virgin, recycled, and refunctionalized materials. The results demonstrate that the LiFePO4 refunctionalization process, through chemical lithiation, decreases the embodied energy by 50% compared to cathode production from virgin materials.

The epicuticular and total waxes of both citrus cultivars were mostly composed of aldehydes, alkanes, fatty acids and primary alcohols. The epicuticular wax accounted for 80% of the total wax in the Newhall fruits and was higher than that in the Satsuma fruits. Scanning electron microscopy showed that larger and more wax platelets were deposited on the surface of Newhall fruits than on the Satsuma fruits. Moreover, the expression levels of genes involved in the wax formation were consistent with the biochemical and crystal morphological analyses. These diversities of fruit wax between the two cultivars may contribute to the differences of fruit postharvest storage properties, which can provide important information for the production of synthetic wax for citrus fruits.

Biodegradation of high concentrations of halomethanes by a fermentative enrichment culture								AMB EXPRESS				4						48	10.1186/s13568-014-0048-5			JUN 14 2014	2014	A fermentative enrichment culture (designated DHM-1) that grows on corn syrup was evaluated for its ability to cometabolically biodegrade high concentrations of chloroform (CF), carbon tetrachloride (CT), and trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11). When provided with corn syrup and vitamin B-12 (0.03 mol B-12 per mol CF), DHM-1 grew and biodegraded up to 2,000 mg/L of CF in 180 days, with only minor transient accumulation of dichloromethane and chloromethane. CT (15 mg/L) and CFC-11 (25 mg/L) were also biodegraded without significant accumulation of halomethane daughter products. The rate of CF biodegradation followed a Michaelis-Menten-like pattern with respect to the B-12 concentration; one-half the maximum rate (66 mg CF/L/d) occurred at 0.005 mol B-12 per mol CF. DHM-1 was able to biodegrade 500 mg/L of CF at an inoculum level as low as 10(-8) mg protein/L. The highest rate of CF biodegradation occurred at pH 7.7; activity decreased substantially below pH 6.0. DHM-1 biodegraded mixtures of CT, CFC-11, and CF, although CFC-11 inhibited CF biodegradation. Evidence for compete defluorination of CFC-11 was obtained based on a fluoride mass balance. Overall, the results suggest that DHM-1 may be effective for bioaugmentation in source zones contaminated with thousands of milligrams per liter of CF and tens of milligrams per liter of CT and CFC-11.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2191-0855			WOS:000358061500001	25401061

The electronic and thermal transport properties of spark plasma sintered polycrystalline Sr1-xYxTiO3-delta (x = 0.05, 0.075, 0.1) ceramics are systematically investigated from (15-800) K. The Sr0.9Y0.1TiO3-delta simultaneously exhibits a large Seebeck coefficient, alpha > -80 mu V/K and moderately high electrical resistivity, rho similar to 0.8 m Omega-cm at a carrier concentration of similar to 10(21) cm(-3) at 300K resulting in a high TE power factor defined herein as (alpha(2)sigma T) similar to 0.84 W/m-K at 760 K. Despite the similar atomic masses of Sr (87.6 g/mol) and Y (88.9 g/mol), the lattice thermal conductivity (kappa L) of Sr1-xYxTiO3-delta is significantly reduced with increased Y-doping, owing to the smaller ionic radii of Y3+ (similar to 1.23 angstrom, coordination number 12) compared to Sr2+ (similar to 1.44 angstrom, coordination number 12) ions. In order to understand the thermal conductivity reduction mechanism, the kappa(L) in the Sr1-xYxTiO3-delta series are phenomenologically modeled with a modified Callaway's equation from 30-600K. Phonon scattering by elastic strain field due to ionic radii mismatch is found to be the prominent scattering mechanism in reducing kappa(L) of these materials. In addition, the effect of Y-doping on the elastic moduli of Sr1-xYxTiO3-delta (x = 0, 0.1) is investigated using resonant ultrasound spectroscopy, which exhibits an anomaly in x = 0.1 in the temperature range 300-600 K. As a result, the phonon mean free path is found to be further reduced in the Sr0.9Y0.1TiO3-delta compared to that of SrTiO3-delta, resulting in a considerably low thermal conductivity kappa similar to 2.7 W/m-K at 760 K. Finally, we report a thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) similar to 0.3 at 760K in the Sr0.9Y0.1TiO3-delta, the highest ZT value reported in the Y-doped SrTiO3 ceramics thus far.

A data set provided by the Companion Animal Parasite Council, which contains county-by-county results of over nine million heartworm tests conducted during 2011 and 2012, is analyzed for predictive structure. The goal is to identify the factors that are important in predicting high canine heartworm prevalence rates.Methods: The factors considered in this study are those envisioned to impact whether a dog is likely to have heartworm. The factors include climate conditions (annual temperature, precipitation, and relative humidity), socio-economic conditions (population density, household income), local topography (surface water and forestation coverage, elevation), and vector presence (several mosquito species). A baseline heartworm prevalence map is constructed using estimated proportions of positive tests in each county of the United States. A smoothing algorithm is employed to remove localized small-scale variation and highlight large-scale structures of the prevalence rates. Logistic regression is used to identify significant factors for predicting heartworm prevalence.Results: All of the examined factors have power in predicting heartworm prevalence, including median household income, annual temperature, county elevation, and presence of the mosquitoes Aedes trivittatus, Aedes sierrensis and Culex quinquefasciatus. Interactions among factors also exist.Conclusions: The factors identified are significant in predicting heartworm prevalence. The factor list is likely incomplete due to data deficiencies. For example, coyotes and feral dogs are known reservoirs of heartworm infection. Unfortunately, no complete data of their populations were available. The regression model considered is currently being explored to forecast future values of heartworm prevalence.									10	0	0	4	0	10			1756-3305			WOS:000339074800001	24906567

As adaptive Lasso may overestimate the number of change-points, we perform post-selection on change-points detected by adaptive Lasso using multivariate t simultaneous confidence intervals.

We have, for the first time, demonstrated a 50 mu m-core-diameter Yb-doped all-solid photonic bandgap fiber laser with a mode area over 4 times that of the previous demonstration. 75W output power has been generated with a diffraction-limited beam and an efficiency of 70% relative to the launched pump power. We have also experimentally confirmed that a robust single-mode regime exists near the high frequency edge of the bandgap. These fibers only guide light within the bandgap over a narrow spectral range, which is essential for lasing far from the gain peak and suppression of stimulated Raman scattering. This work demonstrates the strong potential for mode area scaling of in single-mode all-solid photonic bandgap fibers.

Effects of Mycoplasma gallisepticum vaccination on serum alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein concentrations in commercial layer chickens								POULTRY SCIENCE				93	6			1396	1402		10.3382/ps.2014-03906			JUN 2014	2014	Increases in circulating acute phase protein (APP) levels occur in reaction to systemic infections in animals. However, no previous research has been conducted to monitor possible changes in APP levels of birds in response to prelay vaccinations of various live attenuated Mycoplasma gallisepticum vaccines in conjunction with their subsequent use as an overlay vaccine during the production period. Serum concentrations of the APP, alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein (AGP), were determined on d 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 after subjecting commercial laying hens to one of the following treatments at 10 wk of age (woa): 1) control (no vaccination); 2) ts-11 strain M. gallisepticum (ts11MG) vaccination; 3) M. gallisepticum-bacterin (MGBac) vaccination; and 4) ts11MG and MGBac combination (ts11MG & MGBac) vaccination. Furthermore, at 45 woa, the birds in half of the units assigned to each treatment group were vaccinated with high-passage F-strain M. gallisepticum (HpFMG). Birds in treatment 1 that were (single control) and were not (double control) vaccinated with HpFMG, and birds in treatments 2, 3, and 4 that were vaccinated with HpFMG were further tested during lay on d 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 after vaccination. On d 7, 14, and 28 postvaccination at 10 woa, the ts11MG & MGBac, ts11MG, and MGBac group AGP concentrations were not different from one another, but all were higher than those in the control group. Similarly, on d 3, 7, and 14 postvaccination, the single control, and the MGBac ts11MG, and ts11MG & MGBac treatment groups that were later vaccinated with HpFMG at 45 woa, were not different, but all were higher than that in the double control group. In conclusion, elevated circulation AGP concentrations may be used to detect and confirm subclinical infections in pullets up to 28 d after having been vaccinated with ts11MG, MGBac, or their combination. Furthermore, in association with depressed performance, elevated serum AGP concentrations in layers may be used to confirm HpFMG infections up to 28 d after its use as a vaccine.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0032-5791	1525-3171		WOS:000337078000010	24879689

In this paper, we propose a scheme for spatial resolution enhancement of DHM by using the structured illumination but without phase shifting. The structured illuminations of different directions, which are generated by a spatial light modulator, illuminate the sample sequentially in the object plane. The formed object waves interfere with a reference wave in an off-axis configuration, and a CCD camera records the generated hologram. After the object waves are reconstructed numerically, a synthetic aperture is performed by an iterative algorithm to enhance the spatial resolution. The resolution improvement of the proposed method is proved and demonstrated by both simulation and experiment. (C) 2014 Chinese Laser Press									2	1	0	0	0	3				2327-9125		WOS:000353881100011

For example, Au-21(SR)(14), a magic-numbered cluster, was only obtained as a minor product from a mixture of clusters but was never synthesized in pure form using a single-step synthetic approach. We have made several attempts, albeit without any success, using a variety of approaches to synthesize Au-21(SR)(14), clusters in a single step. We show in this communication that synthetic failure is not likely due to electronic instabilities based on computational investigation of its electronic structure. Our DFT calculations show that the optimized cluster consists of a center Au-13 core cluster capped by two Au-2(SCH2CH3)(3) fragments and four Au(SCH2CH3)(2) fragments and is energetically stable. The findings reported here should give more confidence for the synthetic chemists to successfully synthesize Au-21(SR)(14) in the near future.									1	0	0	1	0	1			2191-9089	2191-9097		WOS:000338341800005

Distribution of Structural Carbohydrates in Corn Plants Across the Southeastern USA								BIOENERGY RESEARCH				7	2			551	558		10.1007/s12155-014-9429-5			JUN 2014	2014	Quantifying lignin and carbohydrate composition of corn (Zea mays L.) is important to support the emerging cellulosic biofuels industry. Therefore, field studies with 0 or 100 % stover removal were established in Alabama and South Carolina as part of the Sun Grant Regional Partnership Corn Stover Project. In Alabama, cereal rye (Secale cereale L.) was also included as an additional experimental factor, serving as a winter cover crop. Plots were located on major soil types representative of their respective states: Compass and Decatur soils in Alabama and a Coxville/Rains-Goldsboro-Lynchburg soil association in South Carolina. Lignin and structural carbohydrate concentrations in the whole (above-ground) plant, cobs, vegetation excluding cobs above the primary ear (top), vegetation below the primary ear (bottom), and vegetation from above the primary ear including cobs (above-ear fraction) were determined using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The distribution of lignin, ash, and structural carbohydrates varied among plant fractions, but neither inclusion of a rye cover crop nor the stover harvest treatments consistently affected carbohydrate concentrations within locations. Total precipitation and average air temperature during the growing season were strongly correlated with stover composition indicating that weather conditions may have multiple effects on potential biofuel production (i.e., not only yield but also stover quality). When compared to the above-ear fractions, bottom plant partitions contained greater lignin concentrations. Holocellulose concentration was consistently greater in the above-ear fractions at all three locations. Data from this study suggests that the above-ear plant portions have the most desirable characteristics for cellulosic ethanol production via fermentation in the southeastern USA.									6	0	0	6	0	6			1939-1234	1939-1242		WOS:000335400800010

The coupled system is formulated as a constrained optimal control problem, where a flow balance is forced across the interface, inflow, and outflow boundaries by minimizing a suitably defined functional. Optimization is achieved by exploiting a Neumann type boundary condition imposed on each subproblem as a control. A numerical algorithm is presented for a least squares functional whose solution yields a minimizer of the constrained optimization problem. Numerical experiments are provided to validate accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0885-7474	1573-7691		WOS:000335575800009

Results of experiments to characterize SRS soil samples, to examine aspects of their radiocesium sorption, and to determine how much of their natural Cs is accessible for chemical extraction and isotope dilution are presented in support of mechanistic hypotheses to explain Cs sorption and fixation in HIV grains. The HIV is responsible for most of the soil cation exchange capacity, and concentrations of naturally occurring Cs, Rb, and K in soil samples are closely related to the concentration of HIV. Experiments with Cs-137 to examine (1) sorption kinetics, (2) blocking of exchange sites with silver thiourea, and (3) susceptibility of sorbed Cs-137 to chemical extraction, support the idea that added Cs is sorbed at different kinds of cation exchange sites in HIV grains. Sites highly selective for Cs but relatively few in number are inferred to exist in interlayer wedge zones within such grains. Little of the naturally occurring Cs in the soil samples was extractable by chemical agents that would remove Cs from ordinary cation-exchange sites and from within non-silicate soil components. Furthermore, most of the natural Cs was inaccessible for isotope dilution under slightly acidic conditions approximating the natural soil environment. These observations support the idea that most of the Cs in these soils has become effectively fixed in the narrower parts of interlayer wedge zones. Control of Cs uptake and fixation by highly Cs-selective interlayer wedge sites would account for the large distribution coefficients found for Cs-137 at the low aqueous Cs concentrations typical of environmental systems and also for the relatively large concentrations of stable Cs in the SRS soils.									3	0	0	2	0	3			0009-8604	1552-8367		WOS:000346817200001

Ghost of land-use past in the context of current land cover: evidence from salamander communities in streams of Blue Ridge and Piedmont ecoregions								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY				92	6			527	536		10.1139/cjz-2013-0307			JUN 2014	2014	The Blue Ridge and Piedmont of the southeastern United States are rich in biodiversity and have undergone centuries of extensive deforestation and subsequent urbanization resulting in geomorphic landscape changes. To investigate the impacts of past and present land uses on stream salamander communities across both ecoregions, we surveyed streams associated with different land uses at the riparian zone and watershed. Using the USGS land-cover data set (2006) and aerial photographs (1940), we assessed the current and historical percent land cover (urban, agriculture, and forests) at local and landscape scales for each sampling site. Using percent land cover as predictors and diversity indices (species richness, Simpson's index, and relative abundance) as response variables, we developed a stepwise multiple regression model and a redundancy analysis. Both analyses indicated the negative impacts of historical land uses, particularly row-crop agriculture, on stream salamander diversity and community structure rendering streams unsuitable for all but the most tolerant species. Legacy effects were prominent in the Piedmont where protected areas with agricultural history were species-deprived (70% decline) compared with stream habitats that had sustained a continuous forest cover through time. Our findings suggested that landscape processes resulting in historical forest cover loss may persist over 50 years during forest recovery.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0008-4301	1480-3283		WOS:000344954000007

This study extends this literature by exploring the role of e-commerce institutional mechanisms in the online repurchase context. In doing so, it responds to the emerging call for understanding the institutional context under which customer trust operates in an e-commerce environment. Specifically, this study introduces a key moderator, perceived effectiveness of e-commerce institutional mechanisms (PEEIM), to the relationships between trust, satisfaction, and repurchase intention. Drawing on the theory of organizational trust, and based on a survey of 362 returning online customers, we find that PEEIM negatively moderates the relationship between trust in an online vendor and online customer repurchase intention, as it decreases the importance of trust to promoting repurchase behavior. We also find that PEEIM positively moderates the relationship between customer satisfaction and trust as it enhances the customer's reliance on past transaction experience with the vendor to reevaluate trust in the vendor. Consistent with the predictions made in the literature, PEEIM does not directly affect trust or repurchase intention. Academic and practical implications and future research directions are discussed.									28	1	0	0	1	29			0276-7783			WOS:000344971000005

A study was conducted in 2009 to 2013 to 1) better understand its life cycle, 2) document its distribution in the states of Georgia (GA), North Carolina (NC) and South Carolina (SC), and 3) document its host range in the urban landscapes of SC. We surveyed 74 locations and found M deklei in urban landscapes of NC, SC and GA, including areas in and surrounding the major urban centers of Wilmington (NC); Myrtle Beach, Georgetown, Charleston, Beaufort and Hilton Head Island (SC); and Savannah (GA). Within this area, M deklei was found to only infest and damage wax myrtles (Myrica cerifera (L.) Small; Myricaceae), although other known suitable host plant genera (e.g., Agave sp., Ilex spp., Sambucus sp., Ditrysinia (= Sebastiania) sp. and Viburnum spp.) were present in the same landscapes. In SC, three overlapping generations of M. deklei were detected annually in 2009 and 2010, with the majority of females overwintering as non-reproductive adults. Crawlers were present from May to December with peak emergence occurring in June, August and October-November.					13th International Symposium on Scale Isect Studies13th International Symposium on Scale Isect Studies	20132013		Sofia, BULGARIASofia, BULGARIA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0324-0770			WOS:000342727200003

Therefore, the National Fire and Fire Surrogate (NFFS) study was conducted to determine the effects of prescribed burning and thinning on different environmental factors. This study was conducted in the Clemson University Experimental Forest in South Carolina, one of the 13 NFFS sites in the United States, and examined the impacts of these management practices on spider populations. We used pitfall traps to sample ground-dwelling spiders to determine if changes in population levels had occurred one year following implementation of these practices. We collected a total of 1220 specimens of Araneae. representing 13 families. Results indicated that by 1-year post-treatment, spider populations had recovered following the initial (2001) burning and thinning However, in 2002, when we compared the first post-burn samples to pre-burn samples in thin+burn plots, we found a significant decrease in the mean abundance of Agelenidae and Linyphiidae after the prescribed burn.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1528-7092	1938-5412		WOS:000342486800018

Using mobile health (mHealth) sensing, which uses medical sensors to collect data about the patients, and mobile phones to act as a gateway between sensors and electronic health record systems, caregivers can continuously monitor the patients and deliver better care. Furthermore, individuals can become better engaged in monitoring and managing their own health. Although some work on mHealth sensing has addressed security, achieving strong privacy for low-power sensors remains a challenge. We make three contributions. First, we propose an mHealth sensing protocol that provides strong security and privacy properties at the link layer, with low energy overhead, suitable for low-power sensors. The protocol uses three novel techniques: adaptive security, to dynamically modify transmission overhead; MAC striping, to make forgery difficult even for small-sized Message Authentication Codes; and asymmetric resource requirements, in recognition of the limited resources in tiny mHealth sensors. Second, we demonstrate its feasibility by implementing a prototype on a Chronos wrist device, and evaluating it experimentally. Third, we provide a security, privacy, and energy analysis of our system.									3	0	0	0	1	4			1383-469X	1572-8153		WOS:000338530300006

Linear Friction Welding Process Model for Carpenter Custom 465 Precipitation-Hardened Martensitic Stainless Steel								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				23	6			2182	2198		10.1007/s11665-014-0985-9			JUN 2014	2014	An Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian finite-element analysis is combined with thermo-mechanical material constitutive models for Carpenter Custom 465 precipitation-hardened martensitic stainless steel to develop a linear friction welding (LFW) process model for this material. The main effort was directed toward developing reliable material constitutive models for Carpenter Custom 465 and toward improving functional relations and parameterization of the workpiece/workpiece contact-interaction models. The LFW process model is then used to predict thermo-mechanical response of Carpenter Custom 465 during LFW. Specifically, temporal evolutions and spatial distribution of temperature within, and expulsion of the workpiece material from, the weld region are examined as a function of the basic LFW process parameters, i.e., (a) contact-pressure history, (b) reciprocation frequency, and (c) reciprocation amplitude. Examination of the results obtained clearly revealed the presence of three zones within the weld, i.e., (a) Contact-interface region, (b) Thermo-mechanically affected zone, and (c) heat-affected zone. While there are no publicly available reports related to Carpenter Custom 465 LFW behavior, to allow an experiment/computation comparison, these findings are consistent with the results of our ongoing companion experimental investigation.									8	0	0	0	0	8			1059-9495	1544-1024		WOS:000336393300031

This allows us to engage broader questions about mass international political economy. Against the recent thrust of a growing literature, we find evidence of material economic "pocketbook" effects-self-interest-on voting behavior, operating alongside symbolic/sociotropic and partisan/political logics. Contrary to expectations, these self-interest effects are not conditional on voter sophistication. We conclude that conventional sampling frames may be inappropriate for understanding contemporary democratic contestation over international economic policy.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0020-8183	1531-5088		WOS:000340709400008

We formulate the Signal passing Tile Assembly Model (STAM), based on the model of Padilla et al. [24] to be asynchronous, allowing, any action of turning a glue on or off, attaching a new tile, or breaking apart an assembly to happen in any order. Within this highly generalized model we provide three new solutions to tile self-assembly problems that have been addressed within the abstract Tile Assembly Model and its variants, showing that signal passing tiles allow for substantial improvement across multiple complexity metrics. Our first result utilizes a recursive assembly process to achieve tile-type efficient assembly of linear structures, using provably fewer tile types than what is possible in standard tile assembly models. Our second system of signal passing tiles simulates any Turing machine with high fuel efficiency by using only a constant number of tiles per computation step. Our third system assembles the discrete Sierpinski triangle, demonstrating that this pattern can be strictly self-assembled wit Tin the STAM. This result is of particular interest in that it is known that this pattern cannot self-assemble within a number of well studied tile self assembly models. Notably, all of our constructions are at temperature 1, further demonstrating that signal-passing confers the power to bypass many restrictions found in standard tile assembly models.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0129-0541	1793-6373		WOS:000340462400007

We report a developing two-step phase-shifting method that reduces the required number of holograms from three to two. Using this method, we resolved microscopic fluorescent beads that were three-dimensionally distributed at different depths with two interferograms captured by a CCD camera. The method enables the FINCHSCOPE to work in conjunction with the frame-straddling technique and significantly enhance imaging speed. (C) The Authors.

The approach utilizes the cascaded optical fiber inline intrinsic Fabry-Perot interferometer and extrinsic Fabry-Perot interferometer as temperature and pressure sensing elements, respectively. A CO2 laser was used to create a loss between them to balance their reflection power levels. The multiplexed signals were demodulated using a Fast Fourier transform-based wavelength tracking method. Experimental results showed that the sensing system could measure temperature and pressure unambiguously in a pressure range of 0 to 6.895 x 10(5) Pa and a temperature range from 20 degrees C to 700 degrees C.

Improvement of Grafted Watermelon Transplant Survival as a Result of Size and Starch Increases Over Time Caused by Rootstock Fatty Alcohol Treatment: Part II								HORTTECHNOLOGY				24	3			350	354					JUN 2014	2014	Fatty alcohol treatments can be used to eliminate the meristem of cucurbit (Cucurbitaceae) rootstocks, which prevents regrowth when grafting, but the effects of the treatment on the rootstock have not been documented. Two rootstock types, 'Emphasis' bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria) and 'Carnivor' interspecific hybrid squash (Cucurbita maxima x C. moschata) commonly used in watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) grafting significantly increased in cotyledon and hypocotyl size over 21 days after treatment (DAT) with a 6.25% fatty alcohol emulsion. There was a significant increase in total soluble sugar (glucose, sucrose, and fructose) content for each rootstock hypocotyl and cotyledon. Starch concentrations of hypocotyls and cotyledons also increased significantly in both rootstocks. This increase in stored energy could greatly increase the success rate of the grafting process. Increased rootstock energy reserves could overcome the need for keeping the rootstock cotyledon intact when grafting.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1063-0198	1943-7714		WOS:000339089000015

Removal of Plant Pathogen Propagules from Irrigation Runoff using Slow Filtration Systems: Quantifying Physical and Biological Components								WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION				225	6					1999	10.1007/s11270-014-1999-5			JUN 2014	2014	Recycling irrigation water is a common practice at ornamental plant nurseries for conserving water; however, it poses the risk of sourcing and dispersing waterborne plant pathogens, especially species of Phytophthora. Slow sand filtration is a water treatment process that can remove pathogens from water, but the slow rate of water treatment may limit its application at nursery operations. In this study, four novel substrates (crushed brick, calcined clay, polyethylene beads, and Kaldnes (R) medium) in addition to sand were examined to determine how effective each substrate was at removing zoospores of Phytophthora nicotianae from water. The effects of substrate physical parameters, substrate depths (0, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 cm), and microbe density (after nursery effluent was recirculated through each substrate for 21 days) on zoospore removal by each substrate were quantified. Sand was the most effective physical filter and supported development of the best biological filter for removing zoospores. Sand columns 40 and 60 cm deep removed zoospores completely using physical filtration alone, and zoospore removal by sand at 10- and 20-cm depths was increased with the addition of biological filtration. Kaldnes (R) medium and polyethylene beads were the least effective filtration substrates under all conditions tested. After 21 days of recirculating nursery effluent through substrate columns, microbe density in and zoospore removal by all substrates increased. With further optimization, crushed brick may have potential to be utilized as a recycled material for a slow filtration system focused on removing plant pathogens from irrigation water.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0049-6979	1573-2932		WOS:000338334200033

Improvement of Grafted Watermelon Transplant Survival as a Result of Size and Starch Increases Over Time Caused by Rootstock Fatty Alcohol Treatment: Part I								HORTTECHNOLOGY				24	3			343	349					JUN 2014	2014	Application of fatty alcohol to rootstocks used for vegetable grafting has been shown to increase the efficiency of producing grafted transplants by controlling cucurbit (Cucurbitaceae) rootstock meristematic regrowth and by allowing the rootstocks to accumulate carbohydrates, especially starch, over time in the hypocotyl and cotyledon. A grafting experiment was conducted to determine the effect of increased carbohydrates on survival of watermelon Citrullus lanatus) grafts using standard grafting procedures. 'Carnivor' interspecific hybrid squash (Cucurbita maxima x C. moscbata) and 'Macis' bottle gourd (Lagenaria sicereria) rootstocks at 1, 7, 14, and 21 days after fatty alcohol treatment were grafted with 'Tri-X 313' seedless watermelon using the one-cotyledon method. Graft survival on 'Macis' rootstock was acceptable or significantly increased up to day 14, with a slight decrease at day 21. Graft survival on 'Carnivor rootstock was also acceptable up to day 21, with a significant increase between days 1 and 7. The second experiment was conducted to determine whether the increased carbohydrates provide sufficient energy to successfully graft without the rootstock cotyledon, a method that has previously shown inconsistent results. Graft survival was improved by 90% using treated 'Carnivor' rootstock 7 days after fatty alcohol treatment and 'Macis' rootstock 14 days after fatty alcohol treatment. Adoption of the hypocotyl-only graft method in commercial production may increase efficiency by better using greenhouse space and could decrease disease probability by removing the cotyledons before grafting.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1063-0198	1943-7714		WOS:000339089000014		
J	Faust, James E.; Korczynski, Pamela C.; Samarakoon, Uttara C.				Samarakoon Basnagala, Uttara/H-1899-2016				Quantifying the Effects of Hanging Baskets on the Greenhouse Light Environment								HORTTECHNOLOGY				24	3			369	373					JUN 2014	2014	During the production of ornamentals in commercial greenhouses, hanging baskets are often grown above the bench or floor space to maximize production. These hanging baskets impact the light environment delivered to the crop underneath. An experiment was conducted to quantify the effect of hanging basket density (determined by number of lines of containers per greenhouse bay and container spacing per line), container content (with plants vs. no plants), and container color (white vs. green) on photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) transmission and red (R) and far-red (FR) light measurements at the greenhouse floor under the hanging basket treatments. Interception of PPF was calculated as a proportion of the treatment with no hanging baskets. Interception of PPF increased as hanging basket density increased, from 5.3% interception at 0.21 containers/yard(2) to 25.5% interception at 2.57 containers/yard(2). Green containers intercepted 36.1% more radiation than the white containers. Presence of plants in the containers resulted in 62.3% greater PPF interception than containers without plants. R:FR was reduced from 1.15 measured under hanging basket treatments without plants to 1.07 under hanging basket treatments containing plants.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1063-0198	1943-7714		WOS:000339089000017		
J	Wright, Ryan T.; Jensen, Matthew L.; Thatcher, Jason Bennett; Dinger, Michael; Marett, Kent								Influence Techniques in Phishing Attacks: An Examination of Vulnerability and Resistance								INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH				25	2			385	400		10.1287/isre.2014.0522			JUN 2014	2014	Phishing is a major threat to individuals and organizations. Along with billions of dollars lost annually, phishing attacks have led to significant data breaches, loss of corporate secrets, and espionage. Despite the significant threat, potential phishing targets have little theoretical or practical guidance on which phishing tactics are most dangerous and require heightened caution. The current study extends persuasion and motivation theory to postulate why certain influence techniques are especially dangerous when used in phishing attacks. We evaluated our hypotheses using a large field experiment that involved sending phishing messages to more than 2,600 participants. Results indicated a disparity in levels of danger presented by different influence techniques used in phishing attacks. Specifically, participants were less vulnerable to phishing influence techniques that relied on fictitious prior shared experience and were more vulnerable to techniques offering a high level of self-determination. By extending persuasion and motivation theory to explain the relative efficacy of phishers' influence techniques, this work clarifies significant vulnerabilities and lays the foundation for individuals and organizations to combat phishing through awareness and training efforts.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1047-7047	1526-5536		WOS:000338701400010

Impact of Corn Earworm Injury on Yield of Transgenic Corn Producing Bt Toxins in the Carolinas								JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY				107	3			1101	1109		10.1603/EC13516			JUN 2014	2014	Transgenic corn, Zea mays L., hybrids expressing insecticidal Cry proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) and insecticide applications to suppress injury from Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) were evaluated in Florence, SC, and in Plymouth, NC, in 2012 and 2013. Based on kernel area injured, insecticide applications (chlorantraniliprole) every 3-4 d from R1 until H. zea had cycled out of corn reduced injury by 80-93% in Florence and 94-95% in Plymouth. Despite intensive applications of insecticide (13-18 per trial), limited injury still occurred in all treated plots in 2012, except in DKC 68-03 (Genuity VT Double PRO), based on kernels injured (both locations) and proportion of injured ears (Florence only). In 2013, ear injury was low in Plymouth, with no kernel injury in any insecticide-treated plots, except P1498R (non-Bt) and P1498YHR (Optimum Intrasect). Injury in Florence in 2013 did not occur in treated plots of DKC 68-04 (non-Bt), DKC 68-03 (Genuity VT Double PRO), and N785-3111 (Agrisure Viptera). Yields were not signi_cantly affected by insecticide treatment and were not statistically different among near-isolines with and without Bt traits. Yields were not significantly associated with kernel injury based on regression analyses. The value of using Bt corn hybrids to manage H. zea is discussed.									5	0	0	5	0	5			0022-0493	1938-291X		WOS:000337174300027	25026670	
J	Woody, Jonathan; Lund, Robert; Gebremichael, Mekonnen								Tuning Extreme NEXRAD and CMORPH Precipitation Estimates								JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY				15	3			1070	1077		10.1175/JHM-D-13-0146.1			JUN 2014	2014	High-resolution satellite precipitation estimates, such as the Climate Prediction Center morphing technique (CMORPH), provide alternative sources of precipitation data for hydrological applications, especially in regions where adequate ground-based instruments are unavailable. These estimates are, however, subject to large errors, especially at times of heavy precipitation. This paper presents a method to distributionally convert a set of CMORPH estimates into ground-based Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) estimates. As our concern lies with floods and extreme precipitation events, a peaks-over-threshold extreme value approach is adopted that fits a generalized Pareto distribution to the large precipitation estimates. A quantile matching transformation is then used to convert CMORPH values into NEXRAD values. The methods are applied in the analysis of 6 yr of precipitation observations from 625 pixels centered around eastern Oklahoma.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1525-755X	1525-7541		WOS:000336954000010

Compared to a control, the enzymatic treatment significantly (p<0.05) increased the juice yield, soluble pectin and total soluble solid (TSS) contents, and the clarity, while decreasing the concentrations of the bitter chemicals naringin, limonin, and nomilin A combined processing treatment of peeling and enzymatic hydrolyses using 5 U/g of pectinase and 0.4 U/g of naringinase at 50 degrees C for 60 min resulted in a juice yield of 42.3%, a TSS content of 11.4 degrees Bx, a titrable acidity (TA) of 0.96%, a vitamin C concentration of 38.4 mg/100 mL, and concentrations of naringin, limonin, and nomilin of 42.4 mu g/mL, 33.5 mu g/mL, and 13.3 mu g/mL, respectively. The enzymatic method was effective and practical for production of high quantity pummelo juice.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1226-7708	2092-6456		WOS:000338688600010
