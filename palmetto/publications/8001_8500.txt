J	Xiao, Feipeng; Punith, V. S.; Amirkhanian, Serji N.								Effects of non-foaming WMA additives on asphalt binders at high performance temperatures								FUEL				94	1			144	155		10.1016/j.fuel.2011.09.017			APR 2012	2012	Due to many reasons including the energy reductions and environmental benefits, warm asphalt has been gaining increasing popularity in recent years around the world. In the present study, the objective was to conduct a laboratory investigation of rheological properties of non-foaming WMA additives at high performance temperatures. The conventional testing procedures such as viscosity, performance grade, creep and creep recovery, amplitude sweep and frequency sweep as well as specific Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) were performed to determine the influences of non-foaming additives on asphalt binders. The experimental design included eight binders and four non-foaming WMA additives. The test results indicated that, the non-foaming WMA additive can slightly reduce the viscosity value of asphalt binder and thus decrease the mixing and compaction temperatures of the mixture. The binders containing non-foam additive have a slight increase in high failure temperatures compared to control binder and thus improving the rutting resistance of the mixtures. In addition, creep recovery, amplitude and frequency sweep tests show that the binders with Sasobit has a slightly higher complex modulus but exhibits lower creep compliance and phase angle than the binder containing other WMA additives regardless of asphalt type and grade. Furthermore, FTIR analysis results indicate that the binder type plays a key role in determining the rheological properties of WMA binders. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Banks, David; Datta, Gauri; Karr, Alan; Lynch, James; Niemi, Jarad; Vera, Francisco								Bayesian CAR models for syndromic surveillance on multiple data streams: Theory and practice								INFORMATION FUSION				13	2	SI		105	116		10.1016/j.inffus.2009.10.005			APR 2012	2012	Syndromic surveillance has, so far, considered only simple models for Bayesian inference. This paper details the methodology for a serious, scalable solution to the problem of combining symptom data from a network of US hospitals for early detection of disease outbreaks. The approach requires high-end Bayesian modeling and significant computation, but the strategy described in this paper appears to be feasible and offers attractive advantages over the methods that are currently used in this area. The method is illustrated by application to ten quarters worth of data on opioid drug abuse surveillance from 636 reporting centers, and then compared to two other syndromic surveillance methods using simulation to create known signal in the drug abuse database.

J	Xuan, Pengfei; Zhang, Yuehua; Tzeng, Tzuen-rong Jeremy; Wan, Xiu-Feng; Luo, Feng								A quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) study on glycan array data to determine the specificities of glycan-binding proteins								GLYCOBIOLOGY				22	4			552	560		10.1093/glycob/cwr163			APR 2012	2012	Advances in glycan array technology have provided opportunities to automatically and systematically characterize the binding specificities of glycan-binding proteins. However, there is still a lack of robust methods for such analyses. In this study, we developed a novel quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) method to analyze glycan array data. We first decomposed glycan chains into mono-, di-, tri- or tetrasaccharide subtrees. The bond information was incorporated into subtrees to help distinguish glycan chain structures. Then, we performed partial least-squares (PLS) regression on glycan array data using the subtrees as features. The application of QSAR to the glycan array data of different glycan-binding proteins demonstrated that PLS regression using subtree features can obtain higher R-2 values and a higher percentage of variance explained in glycan array intensities. Based on the regression coefficients of PLS, we were able to effectively identify subtrees that indicate the binding specificities of a glycan-binding protein. Our approach will facilitate the glycan-binding specificity analysis using the glycan array. A user-friendly web tool of the QSAR method is available at http://bci.clemson.edu/tools/glycan_array.									9	0	0	7	0	9			0959-6658			WOS:000301005600010	22156918	
J	Shen, Haiying; Xu, Cheng-Zhong								Leveraging a Compound Graph-Based DHT for Multi-Attribute Range Queries with Performance Analysis								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS				61	4			433	447		10.1109/TC.2011.30			APR 2012	2012	Resource discovery is critical to the usability and accessibility of grid computing systems. Distributed Hash Table (DHT) has been applied to grid systems as a distributed mechanism for providing scalable range-query and multi-attribute resource discovery. Multi-DHT-based approaches depend on multiple DHT networks with each network responsible for a single attribute. Single-DHT-based approaches keep the resource information of all attributes in a single node. Both classes of approaches lead to high overhead. In this paper, we propose a Low-Overhead Range-query Multi-attribute (LORM) DHT-based resource discovery approach. Unlike other DHT-based approaches, LORM relies on a single compound graph-based DHT network and distributes resource information among nodes in balance by taking advantage of the compound graph structure. Moreover, it has high capability to handle the large-scale and dynamic characteristics of resources in grids. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of LORM in comparison with other resource discovery approaches. LORM dramatically reduces maintenance and resource discovery overhead. In addition, it yields significant improvements in resource location efficiency. We also analyze the performance of the LORM approach rigorously by comparing it with other multi-DHT-based and single-DHT-based approaches with respect to their overhead and efficiency. The analytical results are consistent with experimental results, and prove the superiority of the LORM approach in theory.									7	3	0	0	0	9			0018-9340	1557-9956		WOS:000300574100001		
J	Shen, Haiying; Hwang, Kai								Locality-Preserving Clustering and Discovery of Resources in Wide-Area Distributed Computational Grids								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS				61	4			458	473		10.1109/TC.2011.62			APR 2012	2012	In large-scale computational Grids, discovery of heterogeneous resources as a working group is crucial to achieving scalable performance. This paper presents a resource management scheme including a hierarchical cycloid overlay architecture, resource clustering and discovery algorithms for wide-area distributed Grid systems. We establish program/data locality by clustering resources based on their physical proximity and functional matching with user applications. We further develop dynamism-resilient resource management algorithm, cluster-token forwarding algorithm, and deadline-driven resource management algorithms. The advantage of the proposed scheme lies in low overhead, fast and dynamism-resilient multiresource discovery. The paper presents the scheme, new performance metrics, and experimental simulation results. This scheme compares favorably with other resource discovery methods in static and dynamic Grid applications. In particular, it supports efficient resource clustering, reduces communications cost, and enhances resource discovery success rate in promoting large-scale distributed supercomputing applications.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0018-9340	1557-9956		WOS:000300574100003

The IC50 values of the muscadine and its seed methanolic extracts against the alpha-glucosidase were 1.92 and 1.53 mg/mL, and those against the lipase were 34.41 and 8.63 mg/mL, respectively, which indicated the muscadine possessed the strong anti-diabetes activity. Particularly, the ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extract fractions exhibited the highest inhibitory activities against both enzymes. Since most of the phenolic compounds existed in the EtOAc fractions, it is suggested that phenolic compounds may be the main source against the alpha-glucosidase and pancreatic lipase. Twelve individual phenolics were identified by HPLC-MS. Ellagic acid and quercetin exhibited much stronger anti-diabetic activities among the selected phenolic standards. Besides, the extracts and the phenolic standards obeyed the competitive mode in their enzymatic inhibitions. Published by Elsevier Ltd.									30	3	0	25	1	33			0023-6438			WOS:000299987400024		
J	Grujicic, M.; Pandurangan, B.								Mesoscale analysis of segmental dynamics in microphase-segregated polyurea								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE				47	8			3876	3889		10.1007/s10853-011-6243-8			APR 2012	2012	Polyurea is an elastic co-polymer which possesses a very complex nanometer-scale microstructure consisting of (high glass-transition temperature, T (g)) hydrogen-bonded discrete hard domains dispersed within a (low T (g)) contiguous soft matrix. A number of experimental investigations reported in the open literature clearly established that (a) polyurea has an unusually high capacity for shock mitigation and (b) this ability of polyurea is related to its segmental dynamics (the same process which is responsible for the rubbery-to-glassy transition). Due to the fact that the segmental dynamics in question involves a large number of atoms with coordinated motion and, hence, is associated with nanosecond to microsecond characteristic times, it cannot be generally analyzed using all-atom molecular dynamics techniques. To overcome this problem, mesoscale coarse-grain simulation methods are employed in this study. Within the all-atomic simulation methods, the material is modeled as a collection of constituent atom-size particles. Within the mesoscale methods, on the other hand, this atomistic description of the material is replaced with a collection of coarser particles/beads which account for the collective degrees of freedom of the constituent atoms. Consequently, before the mesoscale methods could be employed to polyurea, all-atom molecular analyses had to be used to determine the basic properties (i.e., mass and radius) of the beads and to parameterize the mesoscale bonding and non-bonding forcefield functions. The mesoscale analyses were then used to (a) obtain critical information regarding the material microstructure and its evolution (from an initially fully blended homogeneous state) and (b) the segmental dynamics in the microsegregated state of the material.									9	0	0	2	0	9			0022-2461			WOS:000299524400047		
J	Tien, Yong Ming; Juang, C. Hsein; Chen, Jian-Min; Pai, Chih-Hung								Isointensity-isoexposure concept for seismic vulnerability analysis - A case study of the 1999 Chi-Chi, Taiwan earthquake								ENGINEERING GEOLOGY				131				1	10		10.1016/j.enggeo.2011.12.004			MAR 29 2012	2012	Fragility curves can be developed using analytical or empirical methods. When the actual building damage records and the associated ground motion data are available, empirical methods are often adopted. Traditionally, district-based records of building damage are analyzed for developing such fragility curves. In this paper, a new procedure based on the concept of "isointensity-isoexposure" is developed. The new procedure is demonstrated through a case study of the building damage records collected from the 1999 Chi-Chi, Taiwan earthquake. The results show that the fragility curves developed with the proposed procedure are more in-line with observations than with the traditional district-based procedure. The developed fragility model may be used for earthquake loss estimation and future emergency planning in the study area. The limitations of the proposed approach include: (1) the developed fragility curves are area-specific and may not be readily applicable to other regions, and (2) ground motion intensity data may not be available at every location in an area of interest.

J	Yang, Fengchun; Anilkumar, Parambath; Anderson, Ankoma; Cao, Li; Meziani, Mohammed J.; Parenzan, Alexander; Sun, Ya-Ping								Facile and Effective Post-Production Separation of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes with Paired Aromatic Molecules: A Molecular Tweezers Approach								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				116	12			6800	6804		10.1021/jp210118q			MAR 29 2012	2012	As-produced single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) are mostly metallic and semiconducting mixtures. The population of semiconducting SWNTs in the as-produced mixtures is generally much higher than that of their metallic counterparts. Therefore, postproduction separation of metallic and semiconducting SWNTs is important to many potential uses of the nanotubes, especially those demanding higher electrical conductivity yet lower optical absorption. Because planar aromatic species are known to have somewhat different interactions with metallic and semiconducting SWNTs, in this work a molecule with a pair of planar aromatic moieties was specifically designed and synthesized to exaggerate the difference in its noncovalent functionalization and solubilization of the two types of nanotubes. As demonstrated, the molecule exhibited significant selectivity toward semiconducting SWNTs in the solubilization to allow the convenient harvesting of bulk metallic and semiconducting fractions in high purities. The results suggest that molecules with paired aromatic species or essentially molecular tweezers may represent a new class of agents for more effective and also relatively simple postproduction bulk separation of metallic and semiconducting SWNTs.									4	1	0	0	0	5			1932-7447			WOS:000302051100003

Prefiltration to suppress protein fouling of microfiltration membranes								SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY				89				329	336		10.1016/j.seppur.2012.01.048			MAR 22 2012	2012	The effect of prefiltration using membranes with pore sizes of 1.0, 0.45 and 0.22 mu m on the permeate flux during direct flow (dead end) filtration using 0.45 mu m polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) coated PTFE membranes has been investigated. Feed solutions consisted of lysozyme, beta-lactoglobulin, ovalbumin and hemoglobin. Prefiltration with a 1.0 mu m pore size membrane led to a stable permeate flux for the lysozyme containing feed stream but was ineffective at preventing severe permeate flux decline for hemoglobin containing feed streams for both membranes. For beta-lactoglobulin and ovalbumin, prefiltration with a 1.0 mu m pore size membrane led to stable permeate flux for the PTFE membrane but was ineffective at preventing severe permeate flux decline for the more hydrophilic PVA coated PTFE membrane probably due to the smaller effective pore diameter of this membrane following coating.However, prefiltration with a 0.45 or 0.22 mu m pore size membrane led to stable permeate flux for all proteins and both membranes. The results indicate the importance of prefiltration to maximize permeate flux, suggesting that flux decline is due to adsorption and deposition of aggregated proteins on the membrane surface.Analysis of FESEM images and ATR-FTIR spectra of virgin and fouled membranes support the flux data and highlights the value of these techniques when investigating mechanisms of flux decline. The results obtained here support earlier work that indicates it is the interplay among membrane properties, protein properties and operating conditions that determines the extent of fouling and flux decline.

The TAR (Trans-Activation Responsive) RNA region, a 59 bp stem-loop structure located at the 5'-end of all nascent viral transcripts, interacts with its target, a key regulatory protein, Tat, and necessitates the replication of HIV-1. Neomycin, an aminosugar, has been shown to exhibit multiple binding sites on TAR RNA. This observation prompted us to design and synthesize a library of triazole-linked neomycin dimers using click chemistry. The binding between neomycin dimers and TAR RNA was characterized using spectroscopic techniques, including FID (fluorescent intercalator displacement), a FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) competitive assay, circular dichroism (CD), and UV thermal denaturation. UV thermal denaturation studies demonstrate that binding of neomycin dimers increases the melting temperature (T-m) of the HIV TAR RNA up to 10 degrees C. Ethidium bromide displacement (FID) and a FRET competition assay revealed nanomolar binding affinity between neomycin dimers and HIV TAR RNA, while in case of neomycin, only weak binding was detected. More importantly, most of the dimers exhibited lower IC50 values toward HIV TAR RNA, when compared to the fluorescent Tat peptide, and show increased selectivity over mutant TAR RNA. Cytopathic effects investigated using MT-2 cells indicate a number of the dimers with high affinity toward TAR show promising anti-HIV activity.									32	0	0	26	0	32			0006-2960			WOS:000301636700017	22339203

Backcross breeding has been underway to introgress resistance from Chinese chestnut into surviving American chestnut genotypes. Development of genomic resources for the family Fagaceae, has focused in this project on Castanea mollissima Blume (Chinese chestnut) and Castanea dentata (Marsh.) Borkh (American chestnut) to aid in the backcross breeding effort and in the eventual identification of blight resistance genes through genomic sequencing and map based cloning. A previous study reported partial characterization of the transcriptomes from these two species. Here, further analyses of a larger dataset and assemblies including both 454 and capillary sequences were performed and defense related genes with differential transcript abundance (GDTA) in canker versus healthy stem tissues were identified.Results: Over one and a half million cDNA reads were assembled into 34,800 transcript contigs from American chestnut and 48,335 transcript contigs from Chinese chestnut. Chestnut cDNA showed higher coding sequence similarity to genes in other woody plants than in herbaceous species. The number of genes tagged, the length of coding sequences, and the numbers of tagged members within gene families showed that the cDNA dataset provides a good resource for studying the American and Chinese chestnut transcriptomes. In silico analysis of transcript abundance identified hundreds of GDTA in canker versus healthy stem tissues. A significant number of additional DTA genes involved in the defense-response not reported in a previous study were identified here. These DTA genes belong to various pathways involving cell wall biosynthesis, reactive oxygen species (ROS), salicylic acid (SA), ethylene, jasmonic acid (JA), abscissic acid (ABA), and hormone signalling. DTA genes were also identified in the hypersensitive response and programmed cell death (PCD) pathways. These DTA genes are candidates for host resistance to the chestnut blight fungus, Cryphonectria parasitica.Conclusions: Our data allowed the identification of many genes and gene network candidates for host resistance to the chestnut blight fungus, Cryphonectria parasitica. The similar set of GDTAs in American chestnut and Chinese chestnut suggests that the variation in sensitivity to this pathogen between these species may be the result of different timing and amplitude of the response of the two to the pathogen infection. Resources developed in this study are useful for functional genomics, comparative genomics, resistance breeding and phylogenetics in the Fagaceae.									22	1	0	20	0	23			1471-2229			WOS:000305276900001	22429310

Hydrothermal Synthesis and Comparative Coordination Chemistry of New Rare-Earth V4+ Compounds								INORGANIC CHEMISTRY				51	6			3588	3596		10.1021/ic2024132			MAR 19 2012	2012	Several new hydrated rare earth vanadates and rare earth oxy-vanadates have been synthesized using hydrothermal techniques and characterized using single crystal and powder X-ray diffraction and infrared and UV-vis absorption spectroscopies. The hydrated rare earth vanadates adopt the space group P2(1)/m with general formula A(3)VO(5)(OH)(3) (A = Y (1), Dy (2), or La (3)) and contain anionic distorted square pyramidal [VO5](-6) units and AO(7) and AO(8) polyhedra. The oxy-vanadates with the general formula A(2)O(VO4) (A = Y (4), Dy (5; 6), or Yb (7)) form two polymorphs in either P2(1)/c or C2/c space groups and contain anionic tetrahedral [VO4](-4) units and nonvanadium bonded O2- anions in distorted [OA(4)] tetrahedra. In all cases, the vanadium ion is in the tetravalent oxidation state, and its original source was the trace V4+ impurities in YVO4. The observed vanadyl and equatorial vanadium-oxygen bond lengths about the square pyramid in compounds 1-3 and the tetrahedral vanadium coordination found in compounds 4-7 are unusual for V4+. The electronic and vibrational spectra are also reported and correlated with the appropriate coordination environment.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0020-1669			WOS:000301624500029	22380848

PLA films were produced from mixed solvent solutions of (M: methylene chloride) and (A: acetonitrile) and 10% plasticizer using the solvent-casting technique. The ratio of solvents used were 70% methylene chloride with 30% acetonitrile (73MA10), 60% methylene chloride with 40% acetonitrile (64MA10) and 50% methylene chloride with 50% acetonitrile (55MA10). The single solvent solution was 100% methylene chloride (100M10). Thermal stability was enhanced by the addition of acetonitrile. Thermal stability of 55MA10 was 0.6219 mu m/degrees C as compared to 15.63 mu m/degrees C for 100M10. Increased concentration of acetonitrile also improved crystal formation as seen by the peak intensity of WAXD. Films that had more crystallinity (64MA10, 55MA10), had less thermal expansion stability and brittle behavior. In contrast, 73MA10 having less crystallinity, had the best flexibility at 49.36% elongation while having similar thermal behavior as the more crystalline films. This work shows that PLA film produced by solvent casting from solvent mixture compared to a traditional single solvent will have better thermal and mechanical performance. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Owczarczak, Alexander B; Shuford, Stephen O; Wood, Scott T; Deitch, Sandra; Dean, Delphine								Creating transient cell membrane pores using a standard inkjet printer.								Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE					61						10.3791/3681			2012 Mar 16	2012	Bioprinting has a wide range of applications and significance, including tissue engineering, direct cell application therapies, and biosensor microfabrication. Recently, thermal inkjet printing has also been used for gene transfection. The thermal inkjet printing process was shown to temporarily disrupt the cell membranes without affecting cell viability. The transient pores in the membrane can be used to introduce molecules, which would otherwise be too large to pass through the membrane, into the cell cytoplasm. The application being demonstrated here is the use of thermal inkjet printing for the incorporation of fluorescently labeled g-actin monomers into cells. The advantage of using thermal ink-jet printing to inject molecules into cells is that the technique is relatively benign to cells. Cell viability after printing has been shown to be similar to standard cell plating methods. In addition, inkjet printing can process thousands of cells in minutes, which is much faster than manual microinjection. The pores created by printing have been shown to close within about two hours. However, there is a limit to the size of the pore created (~10 nm) with this printing technique, which limits the technique to injecting cells with small proteins and/or particles. A standard HP DeskJet 500 printer was modified to allow for cell printing. The cover of the printer was removed and the paper feed mechanism was bypassed using a mechanical lever. A stage was created to allow for placement of microscope slides and coverslips directly under the print head. Ink cartridges were opened, the ink was removed and they were cleaned prior to use with cells. The printing pattern was created using standard drawing software, which then controlled the printer through a simple print command. 3T3 fibroblasts were grown to confluence, trypsinized, and then resuspended into phosphate buffered saline with soluble fluorescently labeled g-actin monomers. The cell suspension was pipetted into the ink cartridge and lines of cells were printed onto glass microscope cover slips. The live cells were imaged using fluorescence microscopy and actin was found throughout the cytoplasm. Incorporation of fluorescent actin into the cell allows for imaging of short-time cytoskeletal dynamics and is useful for a wide range of applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1940-087X		MEDLINE:22453577	22453577

The thermal stability inside the supercooled liquid temperature region was evaluated using Kissinger analysis of primary crystallization, time-temperature-transformation (TTT) diagrams, and the extent of the supercooled liquid region (Delta T-x). The phosphorus-free alloy, Fe78Mo1B15Si6, had an activation energy (E-a) of 414 kJ/mol, Delta T-x similar to 50 K, and began devitrifying after about 1 min at 730 K. By way of comparison, the phosphorus-containing alloy, Fe78Mo1B13P6Si2, had an E-a of 440 kJ/mol, Delta T-x similar to 45 K, and began devitrification after 10 min at 730 K. High saturation magnetization (mu M-0(s) similar to 1.45-1.55 T) and low coercivity (H-c similar to 20 A/m) are demonstrated across the composition range. Core loss measurements of toroidal cores are shown to be less than 12 W/cm(3) at 1 T, maximum induction amplitude (under both sinusoidal and square waveforms). Trends were established for magnetic and thermal stability as a function of metalloid and magnetic transition metal composition. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

J	Baert, Katleen; Devlieghere, Frank; Amiri, Achour; De Meulenaer, Bruno								Evaluation of strategies for reducing patulin contamination of apple juice using a farm to fork risk assessment model								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD MICROBIOLOGY				154	3			119	129		10.1016/j.iffoodmicro.2011.12.015			MAR 15 2012	2012	The numerous studies conducted so far on the issue of patulin contamination have focused mainly on aspects like growth of Penicillium expansum. patulin production under different conditions and the influence of processing on the patulin concentration in apple juice. The purpose of the present study was to collect the necessary information and to develop a quantitative risk assessment model (QRAM) in order to evaluate different strategies to reduce patulin contamination. For apple juice (AJ) production 3 types of apples are considered, namely fresh apples, apples stored under cold air (short term storage) and apples stored under controlled atmosphere (CA) (long term storage). The QRAM described the complete chain from the picking of apples until storage of produced AJ. In comparison to a traditional chemical analysis, the QRAM was found accurate in predicting the concentration of patulin in cloudy and clear AJs commercialised in Belgium. Simulation of the model demonstrated that the use of apples stored under CA contributes to a large extent to the patulin contamination of AJ. Since apples stored in CA are used from more or less January onwards, AJ with high patulin concentration can be produced from January onwards. It would be useful in this respect to take this into account when sampling plans are made by apple juice producers in the framework of their HACCP-system and by governments and control agencies when monitoring programmes are elaborated. The duration of deck storage between the delivery at the apple juice producer (AJP) and the processing of the apples had a large influence on the patulin concentration, and this effect was more pronounced for apples stored under controlled atmosphere compared to apples stored under cold air. The duration of the deck storage should therefore be considered as a Critical Control Point (CCP) within HACCP-systems. Also the application of a sorting step was evaluated to be efficient to reduce the high patulin concentration in AJ. Therefore, a combination of the 2 most effective measures (namely sorting out apples with an infection lesion larger than 10 cm(2) and a reduction of the volume of CA apples) was tested and resulted in a reduction to levels below 25 mu g/kg in 99.7 to 99.9% of the clear and cloudy apple juices, respectively. It is therefore advisable to include a sorting step prior to processing, when apples stored in CA are used. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

To study the steric and electronic effects of substituents at the 8-position of the naphthoyl group, the 3-(4-chloro, bromo and iodo-1-naphthoyl) indoles were also synthesized. The affinities of both groups of compounds for the CB1 and CB2 receptors were determined and several of them were evaluated in vivo in the mouse. The effects of these substituents on receptor affinities and in vivo activity are discussed and structure-activity relationships are presented. Although many of these compounds are selective for the CB2 receptor, only three JWH-423, 1-propyl-3-(4-iodo-1-naphthoyl)indole, JWH-422, 2-methyl-1-propyl-3-(4-iodo-1-naphthoyl) indole, the 2-methyl analog of JWH-423 and JWH-417, 1-pentyl-3-(8-iodo-1-naphthoyl)indole, possess the desirable combination of low CB1 affinity and good CB2 affinity.

Grooved polyacrylonitrile (PAN) HFMs have been successfully fabricated using a dry-jet wet spinning process. Aligned grooves are formed on the HFM inner surface due to process-induced instability under selected fabrication conditions (air gap distance, polymer solution concentration, and polymer solution and nonsolvent flow rates). The influence of different fabrication conditions has been experimentally investigated to appreciate their relationship with the groove formability. It is found that HFMs with aligned grooves on the inner surface can be fabricated within an identified groove forming region, which is defined by the air gap distance, polymer solution concentration, and polymer solution and nonsolvent flow rates; and within the groove forming region, the number of grooves increases with the air gap distance from 1 to 20 cm, and it decreases with the polymer solution concentration and flow rate. The number of grooves is not sensitive to the inner nonsolvent flow rate. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0376-7388			WOS:000300935300004

The balance between antioxidant and prooxidant effect was not apparent. The number of hydroxyl groups, hydrophilicity, steric hindrance, concentration and affinity to peroxidase were critical for the prooxidation behaviour of tested compounds. Ortho-methoxy substitution led to a decreased prooxidant activity for p-courmaric acid. The DNA cleavage activity was in a decreasing order, quercetin = rutin > p-courmaric acid > ferulic acid > quercetin 3-O-glucoside. By calculation of Delta E((LUMO-HOMO)) and Delta HOF, the reactivity of forming phenoxyl radicals was quercetin > rutin > quercetin 3-O-glucoside, which was in agreement with their DNA cleavage activities. The prooxidant activity order of p-courmaric acid and ferulic acid was in contrast to their reactivities of forming phenoxyl radical. The logP difference should play a critical role in the prooxidation behaviour. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									24	1	0	15	0	25			0308-8146			WOS:000297231600017

The effects of PS and buffer layer thickness on the structural and optical properties of ZnO thin films were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and photoluminescence (PL). The ZnO buffer layers, the intensity of the (002) diffraction peak for the ZnO thin films and its full width at half maximum (FWHM) decreased with an increase in the thickness of the ZnO buffer layers, indicating an improvement in the crystal quality of the films. On introducing PS as a substrate, the grain sizes of the ZnO thin films became larger and their residual stress could be relaxed compared with the ZnO thin films grown on Si. The intensity ratio of the ultraviolet (UV) to visible emission peak in the PL spectra of the ZnO thin films increased with an increase in buffer layer thickness. Stronger and narrower UV emission peaks were observed for ZnO thin films grown on PS. Their structural and optical properties were enhanced by increasing the buffer layer thickness. In addition, introduction of PS as a substrate enhanced the structural and optical properties of the ZnO thin films and also suppressed Fabry-Perot interference. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Protective effects of incensole acetate on cerebral ischemic injury								BRAIN RESEARCH				1443				89	97		10.1016/j.brainres.2012.01.001			MAR 14 2012	2012	The resin of Boswellia species is a major anti-inflammatory agent that has been used for centuries to treat various conditions including injuries and inflammatory conditions. Incensole acetate (IA), a major constituent of this resin, has been shown to inhibit NF-kappa B activation and concomitant inflammation, as well as the neurological deficit following head trauma. Here, we show that IA protects against ischemic neuronal damage and reper-fusion injury in mice, attenuating the inflammatory nature of ischemic damage. IA given post-ischemia, reduced infarct volumes and improved neurological activities in the mouse model of ischemic injury in a dose dependent fashion. The protection from damage was accompanied by inhibition of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and TGF-beta expression, as well as NF-kappa B activation following injury. In addition, IA is shown to have a therapeutic window of treatment up to 6 h after ischemic injury. Finally, the protective effects of IA were partially mediated by TRPV3 channels as determined by the TRPV3 deficient mice and channel blocker studies. This study suggests that the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities of IA may serve as a novel therapeutic treatment for ischemic and reperfusion injury, and as a tool in the ongoing research of mechanisms for neurological damage.

Incident translational energies ranged from 291 to 614 meV with surface temperatures from 150 to 500 K. The measurements were taken with a fixed angle of 90 degrees between the source beam and the detector and the angular distributions consisted of a single broad peak with the most probable intensity located at an angle slightly larger than the 45 degrees specular position. Analysis with the hard cubes model for atom-surface scattering indicated that the scattering is primarily a single collision event with a surface having a collective effective mass much larger than a single carbon atom. Limited analysis with a classical diatomic molecular scattering theory was also presented. In this paper a more complete analysis using the classical diatomic molecular scattering theory is presented. The energy and temperature dependence of the observed angular distributions are well described as single collision events with a surface having an effective mass of 1.8 carbon graphite rings. In agreement with the earlier analysis and with other experiments, this suggests a large cooperative response of the carbon atoms in the outermost graphene layer.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0953-8984			WOS:000301176300013	22353319

Using classical perturbation theory combined with a Langevin bath formalism for describing energy transfer, explicit expressions for the scattering probabilities are obtained for both two-dimensional, in-plane scattering and full three-dimensional scattering. For strong surface corrugations results expressed as analytic closed-form equations for the scattering probability are derived which demonstrate that the temperature dependence of the scattering probability weakens with increasing corrugation strength. The relationship to the inelastic rainbow is briefly discussed.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0953-8984			WOS:000301176300004	22354858

The volatile profile of Mangshanyegan was compared with those of other four citrus species, Kaopan pummelo (Citrus grandis), Eureka lemon (Citrus limon), Huangyanbendizao tangerine (Citrus reticulata), and Seike navel orange (Citrus sinensis). Monoterpene hydrocarbons predominated in Mangshanyegan, in particular d-limonene and beta-myrcene, which accounted for 85.75 and 10.89% of total volatiles, respectively. Among the 12 compounds with flavor dilution factors (FD) = 27, 8 oxygenated compounds, including (Z)- and (E)-linalool oxides, were present only in Mangshanyegan. The combined results of GC-O, quantitative analysis, odor activity values (OAVs), and omission tests revealed that beta-myrcene and (Z)- and (E)-linalool oxides were the characteristic aroma compounds of Mangshanyegan, contributing to the balsamic and floral notes of its aroma.									17	3	0	13	0	19			0021-8561			WOS:000301407000028	22352344	
J	Zhao, Yunsong; Zhu, Lin								On-chip coherent combining of angled-grating diode lasers toward bar-scale single-mode lasers								OPTICS EXPRESS				20	6			6375	6384		10.1364/OE.20.006375			MAR 12 2012	2012	Single mode operation of broad-area diode lasers, which is the key to obtain high power, high brightness sources, is difficult due to highly nonlinear materials and strong coupling between gain and index. Conventional broad-area lasers usually operate with multiple modes and have poor beam quality. Laser bars usually consist of incoherently combined broad-area single emitters placed side by side. In this article, we have demonstrated a novel integrated laser architecture in which Bragg diffraction is used to realize simultaneous modal control and coherent combining of broad-area diode lasers. Our experimental results show that two 100 mu m wide, 1.3mm long InP broad-area lasers provide near-diffraction-limited output beam and are coherently combined at the same time without any external optical components. Furthermore, our design can be expanded to a coherently combined broad-area laser array that turns a laser bar into a coherent single mode laser with diffraction-limited beam quality.

The multimodal PSD, which is caused by the mixing of multiple particle and aggregate size groups under flocculation and erosion/resuspension, is a record of the particle and aggregate dynamics in a coastal zone. Curve-fitting software was used to decompose the multimodal PSD into subordinate lognormal PSDs of primary particles, flocculi, microflocs, and macroflocs. The curve-fitting analysis for a time series of multimodal PSDs in the Belgian coastal zone showed the dependency of the multimodality on (1) shear-dependent flocculation in a flood and ebb tide, (2) breakage-resistant flocculation in the spring season, and (3) silt-sized particle erosion and advection in a storm surge. Also, for modeling and simulation purposes, the curve-fitting analysis and the settling flux estimation for the multimodal PSDs showed the possibility of using discrete groups of primary particles, flocculi, microflocs, and macroflocs as an approximation of a continuous multimodal PSD.									14	0	0	0	0	14			0148-0227			WOS:000301477400001		
J	Czech, Christopher; Guarneri, Paolo; Gibert, James; Fadel, Georges								On the accurate analysis of linear elastic meta-material properties for use in design optimization problems								COMPOSITES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				72	5			580	586		10.1016/j.compscitech.2012.01.002			MAR 8 2012	2012	In the field of meta-materials engineering, asymptotic homogenization has proven to be a valuable tool to estimate material properties for many different design needs. Homogenization is used in the design of an object to tie the global material properties to the local material microstructure of the meta-material. The governing equations of the theory are derived from a small-parameter expansion that assumes the scaling length of the unit cell, the smallest repeatable structure found in the material, is much smaller than the entire material length scale. However, for those design problems that do not meet this scaling requirement, the meta-material properties given by homogenization may be inaccurate, leading to error in the material design process.To demonstrate some of these limitations, the more general set of macroscopic analyses derived from the average stress and average strain theorems are applied to several designs in which the assumptions of homogenization theory are no longer valid, those chiefly being materials made of a single or a few layers of unit cells. Then, by applying both materials analyses to simple design problems, the necessity of using a meta-material design method to link global and local properties in a manner consistent with global design methods is demonstrated. In particular, the use of homogenization in designing single layer materials is shown to incur a very large error in the design process, whereas the averaging method is much more accurate.

Pathogen transmission potential within the host community is determined by the relative abilities of host species to maintain and transmit the pathogen and by ecological factors influencing contact rates between hosts and vectors. Increasing evidence of strong feeding preferences by a number of vectors suggests that the host community experienced by the pathogen may be very different from the local host community. We developed an empirically informed transmission model for West Nile virus (WNV) in four sites using one vector species (Culex pipiens) and preferred and non-preferred avian hosts. We measured strong feeding preferences for American robins (Turdus migratorius) by Cx. pipiens, quantified as the proportion of Cx. pipiens blood meals from robins in relation to their abundance (feeding index). The model accurately predicted WNV prevalence in Cx. pipiens at three of four sites. Sensitivity analysis revealed feeding preference was the most influential parameter on intensity and timing of peak WNV infection in Cx. pipiens and a threshold feeding index for transmission was identified. Our findings indicate host preferenceinduced contact heterogeneity is a key mediator of vector-borne pathogen epizootics in multi-species host communities, and should be incorporated into multi-host transmission models.									30	1	0	24	0	31			0962-8452			WOS:000299910400013	21849315

In this work, Pu(V) and Np(V) sorption to Na-montmorillonite was examined as a function of ionic strength, pH, and time. Np(V) sorption equilibrium was reached within 2 h. Sorption was relatively weak and showed a pH and ionic strength dependence. An approximate NpO2+ --> Na+ Vanselow ion exchange coefficient (Kv) was determined on the basis of Np(V) sorption in 0.01 and 1.0 M NaCl solutions at pH < 5 (Kv similar to 0.3). In contrast to Np(V), Pu(V) sorption equilibrium was not achieved on the time-scale of weeks. Pu(V) sorption was much stronger than Np(V), and sorption rates exhibited both a pH and ionic strength dependence. Differences in Np(V) and Pu(V) sorption behavior are indicative of surface-mediated transformation of Pu(V) to Pu(IV) which has been reported for a number of redox-active and redox-inactive minerals. A model of the pH and ionic strength dependence of Pu(V) sorption rates suggests that H+. exchangeable cations facilitate Pu(V) reduction. While surface complexation may play a dominant role in Pu sorption and colloid-facilitated transport under alkaline conditions, results from this study suggest that Pu(V) ion exchange and surface-mediated reduction to Pu(IV) can immobilize Pu or enhance its colloid-facilitated transport in the environment at neutral to mildly acidic pHs.									31	0	0	9	0	31			0013-936X			WOS:000301023700030	22296270

Metal-Ion-Complexing Properties of 2-(Pyrid-2 '-yl)-1, 10-phenanthroline, a More Preorganized Analogue of Terpyridyl. A Crystallographic, Fluorescence, and Thermodynamic Study								INORGANIC CHEMISTRY				51	5			3007	3015		10.1021/ic202337v			MAR 5 2012	2012	Some metal-ion-complexing properties of the ligand 2-(pyrid-2'-yl)-1,10-phenanthroline (MPP) are reported. MPP is of interest in that it is a more preorganized version of 2,2';6,2 ''-terpyridine (tpy). Protonation constants (pK(1) = 4.60; pK(2) = 3.35) for MPP were determined by monitoring the intense pi-pi* transitions of 2 X 10(-5) M solutions of the ligand as a function of the pH at an ionic strength of 0 and 25 degrees C. Formation constants (log K-1) at an ionic strength of 0 and 25 degrees C were obtained by monitoring the pi-pi* transitions of MPP titrated with solutions of the metal ion, or 1:1 solutions of MP P and the metal ion were titrated with acid. Large metal ions such as Ca-II or La-III Law showed increases of log K-1 of about 1.5 log units compared to that of tpy. Small metal ions such as Zn-II and showed little increase in log K-1 for MPP compared to the tpy complexes, which is attributed to the presence of five-membered chelate rings in the MPP complexes, which favor large metal ions. The structure of [Cd(MPP)(H2O)(NO3)(2)] (1) is reported: monoclinic, P2(1)/c, a = 7.4940(13) angstrom, b = 12.165(2) angstrom, c = 20.557(4) angstrom, beta = 96.271(7)degrees, V = 1864.67(9) angstrom(3), Z = 4, and final R = 0.0786. The Cd in 1 is seven-coordinate, comprising the three donor atoms of MPP, a coordinated water, a monodentate, and a bidentate NO3-. Cd-II is a fairly large metal ion, with r(+) = 0.96 angstrom, slightly too small for coordination with MPP. The effect of this size matching in terms of the structure is discussed. Fluorescence spectra of 2 X 10(-7) M MPP in aqueous solution are reported. The nonprotonated MPP ligand fluoresces only weakly, which is attributed to a photoinduced-electron-transfer effect. The chelation-enhanced-fluorescence (CHEF) effect induced by some metal ions is presented, and the trend of the CHEF effect, which is Ca-II > Zn-II > Cd-II similar to La-III > Hg-II, is discussed in terms of factors that control the CHEF effect, such as the heavy-atom effect.									11	0	0	4	0	11			0020-1669			WOS:000301007100035	22356117

Internal consistency and test-retest reliabilities were also assessed.Results: Factor analysis indicated a 4-factor model for ESSPS: positive encouragement, negative role modeling, discouragement, and an item cluster called reinforcement. Psychometric properties indicated that ISSPS performed best as independent single scales with alpha - .87. Internal consistency reliabilities were acceptable, and test-retest reliabilities ranged from low to acceptable. Correlations between scales, subscales, and item clusters were significant (P<.05). In addition, ISSPS and the positive encouragement subscale were significantly correlated with household FV availability.Conclusions and Implications: The ISSPS and ESSPS subscales demonstrated good internal consistency reliability and are suitable for impact assessment of an intervention designed to target parents to help their children eat more fruit and vegetables.									11	0	0	0	0	11			1499-4046			WOS:000306065000008	22230473

The optical band gap and the Urbach energy increased with increasing Mg content. The dispersion energy, the single-oscillator energy, the average oscillator wavelength, the average oscillator strength, and the refractive index at infinite wavelength of the MgxZn1-xO thin films were affected by the incorporation.

We study the populations of massive stars in the Carina region and their energetic feedback and ejection of Al-26.Methods. We did a census of the stellar populations in young stellar clusters within a few degrees of the Carina nebula. For each star we estimated the mass, based on the spectral type and the host cluster age. We used population synthesis to calculate the energetic feedback and ejection of Al-26 from the winds of the massive stars and their supernova explosions. We used 7 years of INTEGRAL observations to measure the Al-26 signal from the region.Results. The INTEGRAL Al-26 signal is not significant with a best-fit value of similar to 1.5 +/- 1.0 x 10(-5) ph cm(-2) s(-1), approximately half of the published Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO) result, but in agreement with the latest CGRO estimates. Our analysis of the stellar populations in the young clusters leads to an expected signal of similar to half the observed value, but the results are consistent within 2 sigma. We find that the fraction of Al-26 ejected in Wolf-Rayet winds is high, and the observed signal is unlikely to be caused by Al-26 ejected in supernovae alone, indicating a strong wind ejection of Al-26. Due to the lack of prominent O stars, regions with ages greater than or similar to 10 Myr are often neglected in studies of OB associations. We find that in the Carina region such clusters contribute significantly to the stellar mass and the energetics of the region.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0004-6361			WOS:000303262000073

Naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides are possibly the "next frontier" in infection prevention. Binding them to mesh could reduce the rate of mesh infections. This study identifies an antimicrobial agent capable of significant antibacterial activity when bound to mesh. Methods. Lysozyme, human beta defensin (HBD-3), human cathelicidin (LL-37), and lysostaphin were adsorbed to polypropylene mesh at various concentrations. Treated meshes were placed in a suspension of 1 x 10(6) Staphylococcus aureus. Antibacterial action was monitored by turbidimetric assay, fluorescent imaging, and a colony counting method. Results. A very high rate of lysis of S aureus cells was observed in the lysostaphin-treated group as measured by optical density; none survived as seen on colony count assays. Optical density for mesh coated with lysozyme, HBD-3, and LL-37 did not differ from untreated controls, with 100% survival rates by colony counts. Conclusion. Lysostaphin had superior antibacterial activity following adsorption to mesh.									4	1	0	2	0	5			1553-3506			WOS:000304145800007	21742659

A Level-3 Reformulation-Linearization Technique-Based Bound for the Quadratic Assignment Problem								INFORMS JOURNAL ON COMPUTING				24	2			202	209		10.1287/ijoc.1110.0450			SPR 2012	2012	We apply the level-3 reformulation-linearization technique (RLT3) to the quadratic assignment problem (QAP). We then present our experience in calculating lower bounds using an essentially new algorithm based on this RLT3 formulation. Our method is not guaranteed to calculate the RLT3 lower bound exactly, but it approximates this lower bound very closely and reaches it in some instances. For Nugent problem instances up to size 24, our RLT3-based lower bound calculation solves these problem instances exactly or serves to verify the optimal value. Calculating lower bounds for problem sizes larger than size 27 still presents a challenge because of the large amount of memory needed to implement the RLT3 formulation. Our presentation emphasizes the steps taken to significantly conserve memory by using the numerous problem symmetries in the RLT3 formulation of the QAP. We implemented this RLT3-based bound calculation in a branch-and-bound algorithm. Experimental results project significant runtime improvement over all other published QAP branch-and-bound solvers.									9	0	0	0	0	9			1091-9856			WOS:000303924600002

The SLM shapes an incoming mode-locked, near-infrared Ti:sapphire laser beam into multiple beamlet arrays with addressable shapes and sizes that match the regions of interest on the sample. Compared with conventional multifocal multiphoton microscope (MMM), AM-MMM achieves the effective use of the laser power with an increase of imaging rate and a decrease of photodamage without sacrifice of resolution.

J	Brodsky, Arthur Nathan; Caldwell, Mary; Harcum, Sarah W.								Glycosylation and post-translational modification gene expression analysis by DNA microarrays for cultured mammalian cells								METHODS				56	3			408	417		10.1016/j.ymeth.2011.10.004			MAR 2012	2012	DNA microarray analysis of gene expression has become a valuable tool for bioprocessing research aimed at improving therapeutic protein yields. The highly parallel nature of DNA microarray technology allows researchers to assess hundreds of gene simultaneously, essentially enabling genome-wide snapshots. The quality and amount of therapeutic proteins produced by cultured mammalian cells rely heavily on the culture environment. In order to implement beneficial changes to the culture environment, a better understanding of the relationship between the product quality and culture environment must be developed. By analyzing gene expression levels under various environmental conditions, light can be shed on the underlying mechanisms. This paper describes a method for evaluating gene expression changes for cultured NS0 cells, a mouse-derived myeloma cell line, under culture environment conditions, such as ammonia buildup, known to affect product quality. These procedures can be easily adapted to other environmental conditions and any mammalian cell lines cultured in suspension, so long as a sufficient number of gene sequences are publicly available.

Based on destructive sampling of root systems of harvested loblolly pine trees, we estimated that root systems contained about 32% (17.2 Mg ha(-1)) at the time of harvest, and about 13% (6.1 Mg ha(-1)) of the soil organic carbon 10 years later. Based on the published roundwood output data, we estimated belowground biomass at the time of harvest for loblolly-shortleaf pine forests harvested between 1995 and 2005 in South Carolina. We then calculated C that remained in the decomposing root systems in 2005 using the decay function developed for loblolly pine. Our calculations indicate that the amount of C stored in decaying roots of loblolly-shortleaf pine forests harvested between 1995 and 2005 in South Carolina was 7.1 Tg. Using a simple extrapolation method, we estimated 331.8 Tg C stored in the decomposing roots due to timber harvest from 1995 to 2005 in the conterminous USA. To fully account for the C stored in the decomposing roots of the US forests, future studies need (1) to quantify decay rates of coarse roots for major tree species in different regions, and (2) to develop a methodology that can determine C stock in decomposing roots resulting from natural mortality.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0044-7447			WOS:000303465000006	22535427	
J	Tams, Stefan								Toward holistic insights into trust in electronic markets: examining the structure of the relationship between vendor trust and its antecedents								INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND E-BUSINESS MANAGEMENT				10	1	SI		149	160		10.1007/s10257-010-0154-0			MAR 2012	2012	This review advances propositions regarding the structure of the relationship between vendor trust and its antecedents as this structure pertains to the relative and complementary effectiveness of trust-building strategies. By understanding how the relationship between vendor trust and its antecedents is structured and why this relationship is structured the way it is, we hope to gain more holistic insights into trust in electronic market transactions and to provide online businesses with a clear recommendation of how to establish trust in an effective and efficient manner. Thus, while past research has made important contributions by uncovering a great number of antecedents to vendor trust, this review examines two strategies more in depth: Vendor reputation and Web site trust. Drawing from the literature on trust, we propose Vendor reputation to be more effective than Web site trust. We also propose a small complementary effect between Vendor reputation and Web site trust that may help online businesses to generate superior vendor trust.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1617-9846	1617-9854		WOS:000303454100010		
J	Roberts, Nicholas; Grover, Varun								Leveraging Information Technology Infrastructure to Facilitate a Firm's Customer Agility and Competitive Activity: An Empirical Investigation								JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS				28	4			231	269		10.2753/MIS0742-1222280409			SPR 2012	2012	This paper investigates how information technology (IT) facilitates a firm's customer agility and, in turn, competitive activity. Customer agility captures the extent to which a firm is able to sense and respond quickly to customer-based opportunities for innovation and competitive action. Drawing from the dynamic capability and IT business value research streams, we propose that IT plays an important role in facilitating a "knowledge creating" synergy derived from the interaction between a firm's Web-based customer infrastructure and its analytical ability. This will enhance the firm's ability to sense customer-based opportunities. IT also plays an important role in "process enhancing" synergy obtained from the interaction between a firm's coordination efforts and its level of information systems integration, which facilitates the firm's ability to respond to those opportunities. We also leverage the competitive dynamics and strategic alignment literature to propose that the alignment between customer-sensing capability and customer-responding capability will impact the firm's competitive activity. We test our model with a two-stage research design in which we survey marketing executives of high-tech firms. Our results show that a Web-based customer infrastructure facilitates a firm's customer-sensing capability; furthermore, analytical ability positively moderates this relationship. We also find that internal systems integration positively moderates the relationship between interfunctional coordination and a firm's customer-responding capability. Finally, our results show that agility alignment affects the efficacy of a firm's competitive actions. In particular, action efficacy is higher when sensing and responding capabilities are both high.									37	0	1	1	1	38			0742-1222	1557-928X		WOS:000303603900010

To date, however, the majority of previous studies have been limited to particle motion within the area of microchannels. This work presents the first experimental and numerical investigation of electrokinetic particle entry into a microchannel. We find that the particle entry motion can be significantly deviated from the fluid streamline by particle dielectrophoresis at the reservoir-microchannel junction. This negative dielectrophoretic motion is induced by the inherent non-uniform electric field at the junction and is insensitive to the microchannel length. It slows down the entering particles and pushes them toward the center of the microchannel. The consequence is the demonstrated particle deflection, focusing, and trapping phenomena at the reservoir-microchannel junction. Such rich phenomena are studied by tuning the AC component of a DC-biased AC electric field. They are also utilized to implement a selective concentration and continuous separation of particles by size inside the entry reservoir.									8	0	0	5	0	8			0173-0835			WOS:000303155700005	22528411

The proposed control technique is designed based on the partial knowledge of the hysteresis model while the mass of the PZTA is assumed to be uncertain. The piezoelectric charge measurement is utilised in the controller design to reduce the effects of the hysteresis. Lyapunov-based stability analysis techniques are utilised to ensure that a desired displacement trajectory is accurately tracked. Representative numerical results are presented and discussed to demonstrate the tracking performance of several desired displacement trajectories with different frequencies and amplitudes. Finally, comparisons with a standard PID controller and a sliding mode controller were performed to examine the effectiveness of the proposed control design.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1751-8644			WOS:000302785800002

The conventional testing procedures such as viscosity, performance grade, creep and creep recovery, amplitude sweep, and frequency sweep were performed to determine the influences of non-foaming additives on asphalt binders. The experimental design included four binders and four non-foaming WMA additives. The test results indicated that, as expected, the non-foaming WMA additive can reduce the viscosity value of asphalt binder and thus decrease the mixing and compaction temperatures of the mixture. The failure temperatures of unaged and rolling thin film oven (RTFO) binders containing non-foam additives have a slight increase compared with the virgin binder, therefore improving the rut resistance of the mixtures. In addition, the creep recovery, amplitude, and frequency sweep tests show that the unaged and RTFO binders with Sasobit have a slightly higher complex modulus but exhibits lower creep compliance and phase angle than the binder containing other WMA additives.

We estimated the effect of loneliness at one point on mortality over the subsequent six years, and investigated social relationships, health behaviors, and health outcomes as potential mechanisms through which loneliness affects mortality risk among older Americans. We operationalized health outcomes as depressive symptoms, self-rated health, and functional limitations, and we conceptualized the relationships between loneliness and each health outcome as reciprocal and dynamic. We found that feelings of loneliness were associated with increased mortality risk over a 6-year period, and that this effect was not explained by social relationships or health behaviors but was modestly explained by health outcomes. In cross-lagged panel models that tested the reciprocal prospective effects of loneliness and health, loneliness both affected and was affected by depressive symptoms and functional limitations over time, and had marginal effects on later self-rated health. These population-based data contribute to a growing literature indicating that loneliness is a risk factor for morbidity and mortality and point to potential mechanisms through which this process works.

This manuscript implements a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) based design approach to assess the performance of vehicular Body-In-White's (BIW) through its complete life cycle. The proposed LCA model will aid in the early design stages (i.e. conceptual design stage) serving as an eco-design decision-making support tool. This study provides a complete life cycle assessment covering the extraction and the processing of virgin materials, the manufacturing, the use and maintenance stage, the end-of-life stage, in addition to the fuel extraction and production stages. Traditional LCA studies do not usually consider the latter stages which accounts for a significant portion of the energy consumed and the generated CO2 emissions. This study results show that the material selection for vehicular applications is a sensitive process not only to the vehicle lifetime (as expressed in traveled miles), but also to the environmental burdens from the extraction stage and recyclability efforts. Additionally, the proposed study shows the effect of the different materials choices on the vehicle structure functionality. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The position of the moving platform is assumed to be measurable, and a second object with known 3-D Euclidean coordinates relative to the world frame is considered to be available a priori. To account for the unknown camera calibration parameters and to estimate the unknown 3-D Euclidean coordinates, an adaptive least squares estimation strategy is employed based on prediction error formulations and a Lyapunov-type stability analysis. The developed estimator is shown to recover the 3-D Euclidean position of the unknown object features despite the lack of knowledge of the camera calibration parameters. Numerical simulation results along with experimental results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1063-6536	1558-0865		WOS:000302694800019

Access to future information is classified into full, partial, or no future information and for each case an energy management strategy with the potential for a real-time implementation is proposed. With full knowledge of future driving conditions, dynamic programming (DP) provides a best-achievable benchmark. A partial preview level has access to future trip terrain and requires velocity estimation. Equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) is deployed as an instantaneous real-time minimization strategy with parameters adjusted by estimated future driving conditions and obtained either from DP or from a backward solution of ECMS. To reduce the requirement for future velocity and detailed terrain information, another partial preview level only assumes known trip distance to the next charging station and elevation changes (if available). In this level, the parameter of the real-time ECMS is estimated based on the remaining trip distance, the battery's state-of-charge, and elevation changes if included. The results are evaluated against cases with no preview. Results from a number of simulation case studies indicate that the fuel economy can be substantially enhanced with only partial preview.									51	7	0	1	0	58			1063-6536			WOS:000302694800027

The hydrostatic pressure force and the wall pressure force terms are combined to simplify the calculations and prevent unphysical flow attributable to improper treatment of the bottom slope term. The treatment of the combined term that appropriately accounts for the momentum flux is given. HLL and Roe Riemann solvers are assessed for the mass and momentum flux terms. Numerical tests are conducted using prismatic rectangular and nonrectangular channels as well as non prismatic channels and natural channel for dam break, supercritical flow, transcritical flow, and dry-bed problems. Slope limiters based on flow cross section area, water surface, and water depth are evaluated. The tests show that HLL and Roe solvers provide similar accuracy. However, the slope limiter based on flow area provides more accurate solutions for tests in nonrectangular and natural channels. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0000501.

It was found that as the Bi2O3 content increased in the glass composition, the observed crystallization tendency is enhanced, and high crystal concentrations were obtained for the glasses with high Bi2O3 content while maintaining transparency in the MIR region. Crystal size in the glass ceramic was reduced by adjusting the heat treatment conditions; the smallest average size obtained in this study is 700 nm. Bi0.864Te0.136O1.568 was identified using X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and found to be the only crystal phase developed in the glass ceramics when the treatment temperature was fixed at 335 degrees C. The morphology of the crystals was studied using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). and crystals were found to be polyhedral structures with uniform sizes and a narrow size distribution for a fixed heat treatment regime. Infrared absorption spectra of the resulting glass ceramics were studied. The glass ceramic retained transparency in the infrared region when the crystals inside were smaller than 1 mu m, with an absorption coefficient less than 0.5/cm in the infrared region from 1.25 to 2.5 mu m. The mechanical properties were also improved after crystallization; the Vickers Hardness value of the glass ceramic increased by 10% relative to the base glass. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, other factors such as lubricant viscosities and materials used are more tightly constrained. In this study, the effect of pattern geometry, feature size and lubricant on contact friction and surface damage was investigated using 316L steel in sliding contact with a stainless steel and polyethylene pins. Using a novel proprietary forming process that creates millions of microstructures in parallel, a variety of micropatterned surfaces were fabricated to study the influence of shape (oval, circular, square), geometry (depressions, pillars) and feature size (10, 50 and 100 mm) on both contact friction and surface damage. All samples were 316L stainless steel and the static and dynamic coefficients of friction when in contact with either a stainless steel or polyethylene counterface were measured in dry and lubricated conditions. All samples were characterized for surface uniformity and pattern aspect ratio using white light interferometry and optical microscope image analysis, and the coefficients of friction were measured for each surface/lubricant/pin system using a CETR scratch testing system. Results showed that round depressions with diameters of 10 mu m had a significantly lower steady state coefficient of friction than the non-patterned substrates or substrates with greater diameter depression patterns. In addition, our results showed that the single-pass coefficient of friction measurements were not good predictors of the steady state coefficient of friction values measured. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

A twinkling effect is observed in fluorescence microscopy of single conjugated polymer nanoparticles, that is, small displacements in the fluorescence spot of single nanoparticles of the conjugated polymer PFBT are observed over time. There is evidence that superquenching by the charge carrier induces a dark spot in the nanoparticle, which moves with the carrier, resulting in the observed displacements in the fluorescence. Zero-field mobilities of individual charge carriers consistent with highly trapped polarons were obtained from tracking experiments.									21	1	0	0	0	22			1530-6984			WOS:000301406800031	22313320

DNA from affected dogs was screened for the mutation known to cause ARHN in ECS. Quantities of COL4A3, COL4A4, and COL4A5 mRNA transcripts in renal cortex were determined using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for ARHN-affected dogs and 7 other dogs. The coding regions of COL4A3 and COL4A4 were sequenced for the 2 ARHN-affected ESS and an unaffected dog. Exon 30 of COL4A4 was sequenced for all 63 ESS.Results: qRT-PCR indicated a significant reduction in transcript levels of both COL4A3 and COL4A4 mRNA in the kidney of ARHN-affected ESS. Sequencing identified a single nucleotide substitution in COL4A4 at base 2806 resulting in a premature stop codon. Thirteen of 25 related dogs were identified as carriers.Conclusions and Clinical Importance: A mutation highly likely to cause ARHN in ESS has been identified.									4	0	0	2	0	4			0891-6640			WOS:000301714600013	22369189

The study aimed at identifying important descriptors for germplasm conservation, validating the crop's geographical centre of origin and facilitating the utilization of existing genetic resources. Frequencies and diversity indices of seven types of seed patterns, 12 qualitative and 28 quantitative traits were evaluated for 124 representative accessions and were analyzed by region to elucidate the geographic distribution of descriptor states. In addition, individual plant samples from a subset of 40 landrace accessions were analyzed by assessing 554 DArT markers. Both the phenetic tree constructed from the qualitative and quantitative descriptors and the population structure derived from DArT marker analysis suggested a relatively high genetic diversity among accessions. Higher genetic diversity was observed for the Cameroon/Nigeria region relative to other regions, in agreement with the hypothesis that this region is the centre of origin for Bambara groundnut. Use of an extensive and diverse range of germplasm and an approach that integrated morphological and quantitative descriptors with DNA markers that represent wide genomic coverage offered a powerful way to make inferences about crop germplasm, in support of crop-improvement programs.									6	0	0	5	0	6			0925-9864			WOS:000300550700003

Using three waves of survey data from the National Study of Youth and Religion, I examine the relationship between family structure, parental breakup, and adolescent religiosity. A person-centered measure of the religiosity of adolescents is used to identify youth as Abiders, Adapters, Assenters, Avoiders, or Atheists and to assess movement of youth between the religious profiles between 2003 and 2008. Wave 1 family structure is not significantly related to religious change among adolescents at Wave 3. In contrast, the experience of a parental breakup is related to a change in religious profiles over time. Parental breakup is associated with religious decline among Abiders and Adapters, youth characterized by high levels of religious salience. However, among Assenters who are marginally tied to religion, a parental breakup or divorce is associated with increased religious engagement.									11	0	0	0	0	11			0021-8294			WOS:000301052900005	22616088

Strain effect analysis on the thermoelectric figure of merit in n-type Si/Ge nanocomposites								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS				111	5					054318	10.1063/1.3693307			MAR 1 2012	2012	In this paper, the effect of strain on the thermoelectric figure of merit is investigated in n-type Ge nanowire-Si host nanocomposite materials. The Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity of the Si-Ge nanocomposites are calculated using an analytical model derived from the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) under the relaxation-time approximation. The effect of strain is incorporated into the BTE through the strain induced energy shift and effective mass variation calculated from the deformation potential theory and a degenerate k . p method at the zone-boundary X point. The effect of strain on the phonon thermal conductivity in the nanocomposites is computed with a model combining the strain dependent lattice dynamics and the ballistic phonon BTE. The electronic thermal conductivity is computed from the electrical conductivity using the Wiedemann-Franz law. Normal and shear strains are applied in the transverse plane of the Si-Ge nanocomposites. Thermoelectric properties, including the electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and dimensionless figure of merit, are computed for Si-Ge nanocomposites under these strain conditions.

J	Lee, Jaechoul; Lund, Robert								A refined efficiency rate for ordinary least squares and generalized least squares estimators for a linear trend with autoregressive errors								JOURNAL OF TIME SERIES ANALYSIS				33	2			312	324		10.1111/j.1467-9892.2011.00768.x			MAR 2012	2012	When a straight line is fitted to time series data, generalized least squares (GLS) estimators of the trend slope and intercept are attractive as they are unbiased and of minimum variance. However, computing GLS estimators is laborious as their form depends on the autocovariances of the regression errors. On the other hand, ordinary least squares (OLS) estimators are easy to compute and do not involve the error autocovariance structure. It has been known for 50 years that OLS and GLS estimators have the same asymptotic variance when the errors are second-order stationary. Hence, little precision is gained by using GLS estimators in stationary error settings. This article revisits this classical issue, deriving explicit expressions for the GLS estimators and their variances when the regression errors are drawn from an autoregressive process. These expressions are used to show that OLS methods are even more efficient than previously thought. Specifically, we show that the convergence rate of variance differences is one polynomial degree higher than that of least squares estimator variances. We also refine Grenander's (1954) variance ratio. An example is presented where our new rates cannot be improved upon. Simulations show that the results change little when the autoregressive parameters are estimated.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0143-9782			WOS:000301114500012

This portion of the material behavior is often neglected in material models for glass which tend to focus on the damage and fracture phenomena of the material. However, material nonlinearity/inelasticity can, in principle, have a profound effect on wave/shock propagation phenomena and processes (e. g. spall fracture).Within the present work, the effect of material nonlinearity and inelastic behavior on the dynamic response (including spallation) of soda-lime glass is studied under symmetric flyer-plate loading conditions using computational methods and tools. Material nonlinearity and deformation irreversibility are modeled in two different ways: (a) as a non-linear elastic material response with no deformation irreversibility; and (b) as a linear-elastic, volumetrically-plastic deformation response. Incorporation of nonlinearity and inelasticity phenomena into a continuum-level material model for soda-lime glass recently developed by the authors revealed that while these phenomena do not measurably affect spall resistance (as measured by a minimum flyer-plate velocity resulting in spallation), they provide beneficial linear-momentum/kinetic energy reduction effects.

DISCONTINUOUS GALERKIN METHOD FOR 1D SHALLOW WATER FLOWS IN NATURAL RIVERS								ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF COMPUTATIONAL FLUID MECHANICS				6	1			74	86					MAR 2012	2012	A numerical model is proposed for the solution of one-dimensional shallow water flow equations for natural rivers. This model is based on the total variation diminishing Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin finite element method. In natural rivers, the cross-section shape and bed slope can be quite irregular, which requires a compatible discretization scheme for the bed slope term and net pressure force term. Therefore, in this model, the hydrostatic pressure force term and the wall pressure force term are combined and a new discretization for the resulting term is introduced. This formulation is shown to prevent unphysical flow due to improper treatment of bottom slope term. The mass and momentum flux term are calculated by HLL Riemann solver. A scheme is presented to model flow over dry bed. To evaluate the numerical scheme, tests are conducted for idealized dambreak problems in parabolic (with wet and dry beds), and rectangular channels, hydraulic jump in a rectangular channel, dambreak in the Teton River (Idaho, USA) and the Toce River (Northern Alps, Italy), and flooding event in the East Fork River (Wyoming, USA). The comparison of the computational results with analytical and laboratory results of dam break flows shows that the model is capable of handling flow over dry areas. The simulation results for hydraulic jump show the discharge conservation property and shock prediction capability of the model. The dambreak and flood simulations in natural channels show that the model is capable of handling flows in highly varying bed topography and channel geometry.									19	3	0	1	0	19			1994-2060	1997-003X		WOS:000301876200007

Characterizing the effects of cell settling on bioprinter output								BIOFABRICATION				4	1					011001	10.1088/1758-5082/4/1/011001			MAR 2012	2012	The time variation in bioprinter output, i.e. the number of cells per printed drop, was studied over the length of a typical printing experiment. This variation impacts the cell population size of bioprinted samples, which should ideally be consistent. The variation in output was specifically studied in the context of cell settling. The bioprinter studied is based on the thermal inkjet HP26A cartridge; however, the results are relevant to other cell delivery systems that draw fluid from a reservoir. A simple mathematical model suggests that the cell concentration in the bottom of the reservoir should increase linearly over time, up to some maximum, and that the cell output should be proportional to this concentration. Two studies were performed in which D1 murine stem cells and similarly sized polystyrene latex beads were printed. The bead output profiles were consistent with the model. The cell output profiles initially followed the increasing trend predicted by the settling model, but after several minutes the cell output peaked and then decreased. The decrease in cell output was found to be associated with the number of use cycles the cartridge had experienced. The differing results for beads and cells suggest that a biological process, such as adhesion, causes the decrease in cell output. Further work will be required to identify the exact process.									7	0	0	5	0	7			1758-5082			WOS:000301863800001	22257751

Encapsulated alliinase were significantly higher (30 and 22%, respectively) than those of non-encapsulated alliinase at 60 degrees C and at pH 2. Therefore, microencapsulation of alliinase with alginate can offer an effective way of sustaining enzyme activity during oral administration and passage through the stomach.									4	0	0	1	0	4			0141-5492			WOS:000301296300015	22072113

Cyber Incivility @ Work: The New Age of Interpersonal Deviance								CYBERPSYCHOLOGY BEHAVIOR AND SOCIAL NETWORKING				15	3			148	154		10.1089/cyber.2011.0336			MAR 2012	2012	The current study was designed to extend the interpersonal deviance literature into the online domain by examining the incidence and impact of supervisor cyber incivility and neuroticism on employee outcomes at work. Conservation of Resources (COR) theory was used as the guiding framework because cyber incivility is thought to deplete energetic resources in much the same way that other stressors do, ultimately leading to negative outcomes like burnout. Results indicate that supervisor cyber incivility is positively related to burnout, absenteeism, and turnover intentions. Support was also found for the role of neuroticism as a moderator of the relationship between supervisor cyber incivility and outcomes. In general, the relations between cyber incivility and outcomes were stronger for those individuals reporting higher levels of neuroticism. Results are discussed in terms of COR theory, and possible mechanisms for the role of neuroticism in the stressor-strain relationship are discussed. The current study highlights the importance of understanding workplace online behavior and its impact on employee health and organizational well-being. Future research directions examining online interpersonal deviance are suggested.									7	0	0	0	0	7			2152-2715			WOS:000301427400005	22304404	
J	Grayson, Michael; Pang, WeiChiang; Schiff, Scott								Three-dimensional probabilistic wind-borne debris trajectory model for building envelope impact risk assessment								JOURNAL OF WIND ENGINEERING AND INDUSTRIAL AERODYNAMICS				102				22	35		10.1016/j.jweia.2012.01.002			MAR 2012	2012	This paper presents a probabilistic debris trajectory model adapted from current 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) deterministic models, in which the aleatoric (inherent) uncertainty is explicitly considered in the proposed probabilistic model. While the inherent randomness in the debris flight trajectory is irreducible due to the wind turbulence, variation in wind direction, gustiness of the wind event, and so forth, the proposed probabilistic model seeks to address these uncertainties through Monte Carlo simulations with the appropriate statistical distributions applied to the governing equations of motion of the debris. Calibration of the probabilistic debris trajectory model is performed through an analytical and visual comparison of the simulated data to wind tunnel test data. Reasonable agreement is observed between the simulated and the wind tunnel test debris landing locations, thus confirming the applicability of the probabilistic wind-borne debris model. The proposed probabilistic model provides an effective method for predicting the variation of debris trajectories in a three-dimensional (3D) space, which is imperative when performing regional building envelope impact risk assessments in which a large amount of debris sources and targets must be considered in the simulation.

J	Gomer, Joshua A.; Pagano, Christopher C.								Spatial Perception and Robot Operation: Selection, Training, Gaming, and Design								NAVAL ENGINEERS JOURNAL				124	1			131	140					MAR 2012	2012	This research investigated the relationship between spatial perception abilities (both spatial orientation and spatial visualization), previous gaming experience, and unmanned robot operation under direct-line-of-sight and teleoperation viewing conditions. This study was a primary effort to determine if spatial ability testing may be a useful tool in the selection of robot operators. Additionally, we investigated how previous gaming experience impacted performance. One hundred and twenty Clemson University students and employees completed eight cognitive ability measures based on task analyses for each robot platform and operated one of four types of robots under tasks of low and high difficulty. Robotic platforms included a stationary arm, a mobile six-wheeled vehicle with robotic arm and claw, a mobile tracked vehicle, and a mobile wheeled vehicle. Performance for each participant was tested with tasks completed under viewing conditions of both direct-line-of-sight and teleoperation. Results provide evidence that spatial abilities are reliable predictors of direct-line-of-sight and teleoperation performance. Participants in this study with higher spatial abilities completed their tasks faster and with fewer errors. In addition, participants with higher spatial abilities were more successful at completing the task. A multiple regression predicting total task completion times from standardized spatial ability aggregate scores and current gaming hours was also significant. Gaming experience appeared to assist those with lower spatial abilities in completing tasks nearly as fast as those with higher spacial abilities. This two-way interaction supports that gaming may be a useful tool for integrated training of unmanned systems or other types of machines that rely on spatial perception abilities. Applications of these findings are discussed in terms of teleoperator selection cools, human system integration (HSI) training, gaming experience, and human-centered design recommendations for unmanned systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0028-1425			WOS:000301898300008

Two plasma modes were found to exist in the same plasma array structure under a change of gas flow conditions: an intense plasma mode and the well-collimated plasma mode. In order to describe the direct jet-to-jet coupling by electrical coupling of charged particles in the plasma, the optical emission of the plasma array was compared with that of a single tube plasma jet. Under identical electrical driving and gas conditions, the optical intensity from the intense plasma jet was approximately four times larger in the coupled array than in the single plasma jet structure. Additionally, the electron energy in the intense plasma was larger than that of the well-collimated plasma jets in the same device. This intense and energetic plasma jet, arising through direct jet-to-jet coupling, may provide novel applications requiring strong discharge processes using simplified structures and accompanying instrumentation when compared with the present vacuum plasma systems.									27	4	0	0	0	31			1612-8850			WOS:000301225300004

Previous studies have not examined the effect of this confound in a complex, high-traffic scenario in a driving simulator or on visuomotor behavior. In the first experiment, drivers detected brake lamps on nine lead vehicles and lane changes on two rear vehicles in a 15 min simulated night time highway drive. A second experiment was used to examine the findings in the context of pre-attentive visual processing research. A third experiment analyzed visuomotor behavior and subjective workload during a vigilance task to further evaluate this hypothesis. For all studies, tail lamp color was manipulated, resulting in two conditions: the currently mandated red tail lamps and red brake lamps vs. yellow tail lamps and red brake lamps. Compared to current rear lighting, employing yellow tail lamps with red brake lamps reduced RT, error, subjective workload, improved performance in detecting lane changes and also changed visuomotor behavior. It is suggested that the mechanism allowing better performance is pre-attentive, parallel visual processing. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

To examine student thinking about networks we used graphical responses, since they are easier to evaluate for implied, but unarticulated assumptions. Senior college level molecular biology students were presented with simple molecular level scenarios; surprisingly, most students failed to articulate the basic assumptions needed to generate reasonable graphical representations; their graphs often contradicted their explicit assumptions. We then developed a tiered Socratic tutorial based on leading questions designed to provoke metacognitive reflection. The activity is characterized by leading questions (prompts) designed to provoke meta-cognitive reflection. When applied in a group or individual setting, there was clear improvement in targeted areas. Our results highlight the promise of using graphical responses and Socratic prompts in a tutorial context as both a formative assessment for students and an informative feedback system for instructors, in part because graphical responses are relatively easy to evaluate for implied, but unarticulated assumptions.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1470-8175			WOS:000301486500004	22419590

The changes of protein's stability due to naturally occurring mutations, missense mutations, are typically causing diseases. Single point mutations made in vitro are frequently used to assess the contribution of given amino acid to the stability of the protein. In both cases, it is desirable to predict the change of the folding free energy upon single point mutations in order to either provide insights of the molecular mechanism of the change or to design new experimental studies.Results: We report an approach that predicts the free energy change upon single point mutation by utilizing the 3D structure of the wild-type protein. It is based on variation of the molecular mechanics Generalized Born (MMGB) method, scaled with optimized parameters (sMMGB) and utilizing specific model of unfolded state. The corresponding mutations are built in silico and the predictions are tested against large dataset of 1109 mutations with experimentally measured changes of the folding free energy.

J	Clements, Paul; McGregor, John								Better, faster, cheaper: Pick any three								BUSINESS HORIZONS				55	2			201	208		10.1016/j.bushor.2011.12.001			MAR-APR 2012	2012	A strategy called software product line engineering, or SPLE, is taking hold in industries in which software is an integral part of product offerings. Where it has found a foothold, SPLE has brought about remarkable results such as unprecedented product variation, substantial production cost savings, slashing of time to market, and massive productivity gains. SPLE is the software version of an old manufacturing concept: building a suite of products from common parts assembled under a common design in a common production facility. The special properties of software make SPLE a particularly high-payoff proposition. SPLE exploits the commonalities among products to achieve economies of scale, by creating core assets assets that will be applied to multiple products in the product line. SPLE accommodates the differences among products by explicitly identifying and planning for those variations in product behavior and qualities. This management of variation allows the organization to achieve economies of scope and provides the capability of mass customization where every market is treated as a niche. Management ensures that core asset developers create effective core assets and product builders efficiently build products by using them. This requires oversight, coordination, and melding of purpose of groups that have slightly different inherent goals. (C) 2011 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.

Conservation focusing on forest-dwelling bats requires understanding of community-level interactions between these predators and their insect prey. Our study assessed bat activity and insect occurrence (abundance and diversity) across a gradient of forest disturbance and structure (silvicultural treatments) in the Central Appalachian region of North America. We conducted acoustic surveys of bat echolocation concurrent with insect surveys using blacklight and malaise traps over 2 years. Predator activity, prey occurrence and prey biomass varied seasonally and across the region. The number of bat echolocation pulses was positively related with forest disturbance, whereas prey demonstrated varied trends. Lepidopteran abundance was negatively related with disturbance, while dipteran abundance and diversity was positively related with disturbance. Coleoptera were unaffected. Neither bat nor insect response variables differed between plot interiors and edges. Correlations between bat activity and vegetative structure reflected differences in foraging behavior among ensembles. Activity of myotine bats was correlated with variables describing sub-canopy vegetation, whereas activity of lasiurine bats was more closely correlated with canopy-level vegetation. Lepidopteran abundance was correlated with variables describing canopy and sub-canopy vegetation, whereas coleopteran and dipteran occurrence were more closely correlated with canopy-level vegetative structure. Our study demonstrates regional variation in bat activity and prey occurrence across a forested disturbance gradient. Land management and conservation efforts should consider the importance of vegetation structure and plant species richness to sustain forest-dwelling bats and their insect prey.

Our discrete-line-focus design eliminates the cross talk that occurs in conventional one-dimensional line-scanning multiphoton microscopies. Additionally, a phase-only spatial light modulator is able to scan only a sample's target area by generating a specific discrete line focus according to the shape and location of the target area. Compared with other multiphoton microscopies, this technique shortens scanning time and minimizes photodamage by concentrating scanning energy and dwell time on the area of interest.

The use of reflective markings on a pedestrian's major joints to facilitate the perception of biological motion has been shown to greatly enhance pedestrian conspicuity at night, but few corresponding data exist for bicyclists. Twelve younger and twelve older participants drove around a closed-road circuit at night and indicated when they first recognized a bicyclist who wore black clothing either alone, or together with a reflective bicycling vest, or a vest plus ankle and knee reflectors. The bicyclist pedalled in place on a bicycle that had either a static or flashing light, or no light on the handlebars. Bicyclist clothing significantly affected conspicuity; drivers responded to bicyclists wearing the vest plus ankle and knee reflectors at significantly longer distances than when the bicyclist wore the vest alone or black clothing without a vest. Older drivers responded to bicyclists less often and at shorter distances than younger drivers. The presence of a bicycle light, whether static or flashing, did not enhance the conspicuity of the bicyclist; this may result in bicyclists who use a bicycle light being overconfident of their own conspicuity at night. The implications of our findings are that ankle and knee markings are a simple and very effective approach for enhancing bicyclist conspicuity at night. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Dissecting Genotype x Environment Interactions and Trait Correlations Present in the Pee Dee Cotton Germplasm Collection following Seventy Years of Plant Breeding								CROP SCIENCE				52	2			690	699		10.2135/cropsci2011.07.0380			MAR-APR 2012	2012	Genotype x environment (G x E) interactions and trait correlations significantly impact efforts to develop high-yield, high-quality, and environmentally stable Upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) cultivars. Knowledge of both can and should be used to design optimal breeding programs and effective selection criteria. In this study, we examined the G x E interactions and trait correlations present in the 70-yr Pee Dee cotton germplasm enhancement program. Since beginning in 1935, the Pee Dee program has employed a variety of unique germplasm and breeding methods to release >80 improved germplasm lines and cultivars. Results suggest that significant G x E interactions exist for several agronomic and fiber quality performance traits that are mostly due to changes in magnitude. Negative genotypic correlations still persist between lint percent/lint yield and fiber length/fiber strength. However, apparently the breeding methods and selection criteria used over 70 yr have lessened the negative relationship between agronomic performance and fiber quality over time to some degree. The results provide cotton breeders a resource to select specific Pee Dee germplasm lines for increased environmental stability. Cotton breeders can also use the information herein to select specific Pee Dee germplasm lines that represent rare recombination events that combine high yield and fiber quality potential.									10	0	0	7	0	10			0011-183X			WOS:000300800400024

Forage Accumulation, Nutritive Value, and Persistence of 'Mulato II' Brachiariagrass in Northern Florida								CROP SCIENCE				52	2			914	922		10.2135/cropsci2011.06.0338			MAR-APR 2012	2012	'Mulato II' [Brachiaria spp.] is a warm-season grass with excellent nutritive value adapted to tropical regions; however, its herbage production and persistence in subtropical locations is unknown. Grazing and clipping studies were conducted in 2008 and 2009 in Marianna and Gainesville, FL, respectively. The treatments for the grazing study were beef heifers (Bos spp.) grazing Mulato II, 'Tifleaf 3' pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br], or 'Hayday' sorghum-sudangrassgrass [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] pastures on a continuous stocking rate. In 2008, there were no differences in herbage allowance (HA) (0.9 kg dry matter [DM] kg(-1) live weight [LW]), average daily gain (ADG) (0.5 kg d(-1)), and gain per hectare (168 kg) among treatments. However, Mulato II had greater HA (2.0 vs. 0.7 kg DM kg(-1) LW) and ADG (0.78 vs. 0.41 kg d(-1)) than Tifleaf 3 and Hayday and similar gain per hectare (302 kg) in 2009. The treatments for the clipping study were Mulato II, evaluated as an annual and perennial, 'Tifton 85' bermudagrass (Cynodon spp.), Tifleaf 3 pearl millet, and Hayday sorghum-sudangrass. In 2008, Hayday and Tifleaf 3 established more rapidly than Mulato II; however, Mulato II grew later in the fall. In 2009, the perennial treatments (Mulato II and Tifton 85) had overall greater herbage accumulation than the annual treatments. In the clipping study, Tifton 85 had greater ground cover than Mulato II perennial in 2009 (73 vs. 36%) and 2010 (73 vs. 12%). Mulato II may be used as a high quality, short-lived perennial warm-season grass in subtropical areas.									5	0	0	4	0	5			0011-183X			WOS:000300800400046

Optimum seeking-based non-linear controller to maximise energy capture in a variable speed wind turbine								IET CONTROL THEORY AND APPLICATIONS				6	4			526	532		10.1049/iet-cta.2010.0689			MAR 2012	2012	In this study, an optimum seeking-based robust non-linear controller is proposed to maximise wind energy captured by variable speed wind turbines at low-to-medium wind speeds. The proposed strategy simultaneously controls the blade pitch angle and tip-speed ratio, through the turbine rotor angular speed, to an optimal point at which the power coefficient, and hence the wind turbine efficiency, is maximum. The optimal points are given to the controller by an optimisation algorithm that seeks the unknown optimal blade pitch angle and rotor speed. The control method allows for aerodynamic rotor power maximisation without exact knowledge of the wind turbine model. A representative numerical simulation is presented to show that the wind turbine can be accurately controlled to achieve maximum energy capture.									12	0	0	0	1	13			1751-8644	1751-8652		WOS:000301183700006

ImPACT CT Patient Dosimetry Calculator (version 1.0) was used to compute absorbed doses to eight organs of interest in medical radiation dosimetry. For 13 dosimetry data sets, the authors calculated the maximum organ dose (D-max) as well as the corresponding organ dose for a scan with selected length D(L). These data permitted the relative dose (DrD(L)/D-max) to be determined for varying scan lengths. Computations were performed for a nominal X-ray tube current of 100 mA, a rotation time of 1 s and a CT pitch of 1. The authors also determined values of D-max/CTDIvol, where CTDIvol is obtained in a 32-cm diameter CT dosimetry phantom using the same radiographic techniques. For each organ, D-r was independent of the type of scanner, and increased monotonically to unity with increasing scan length. Relative doses for a scan restricted to the organ length ranged from 0.65 D-max for the bladder to 0.86 D-max for the lungs. There was good correlation (r0.64) between relative organ dose and the corresponding organ length. At 120 kV, the lowest value of D-max/CTDIvol was 1.23 for the breast and the highest was 2.22 for the thyroid. Varying the X-ray tube voltage between 100 and 130 kV results in changes in D-max/CTDIvol of no more than 4 . CT scans limited to the direct irradiation of an average-sized organ results in an absorbed dose of approximate to 0.75 D-max.									4	0	0	1	0	4			0144-8420			WOS:000300730000009	21561946

TBL is a comprehensive strategy for developing and using self-managed learning teams that has created a fertile area for medical education scholarship. However, because this method can be implemented in a variety of ways, published reports about TBL may be difficult to understand, critique, replicate, or compare unless authors fully describe their interventions. The authors of this article offer a conceptual model and propose a set of guidelines for standardizing the way that the results of TBL implementations are reported and critiqued. They identify and articulate the seven core design elements that underlie the TBL method and relate them to educational principles that maximize student engagement and learning within teams. The guidelines underscore important principles relevant to many forms of small-group learning. The authors suggest that following these guidelines when writing articles about TBL implementations should help standardize descriptive information in the medical and health sciences education literature about the essential aspects of TBL activities and allow authors and reviewers to successfully replicate TBL implementations and draw meaningful conclusions about observed outcomes.									39	0	0	2	0	39			1040-2446			WOS:000300989500015	22373620

We compared IVF outcomes in 97 infertile women who had undergone ?3 integrin assessment by immunohistochemistry in mid-luteal endometrial biopsies. Of 79 women undergoing standard IVF, 29 (36.7) lacked normal integrin expression. Eighteen other women with low integrin were studied after receiving letrozole during early IVF stimulation. An independent set of ?3 integrin-negative patients (n 15) who had undergone repeat endometrial biopsy for integrin testing while taking letrozole were re-evaluated.Clinical pregnancy and delivery rates were higher in women with normal ?3 integrin expression compared with those who were integrin negative [20/50 (40) versus 4/29 (13.8); P 0.02 and 19/50 (38) versus 2/29 (7); P 0.01, respectively]. In 18 women who received letrozole early in IVF, 11 conceived (61.1; P 0.001) compared with integrin-negative patients who did not receive letrozole. In integrin-negative women who were rebiopsied on letrozole, 66.7 reverted to normal integrin expression. Positive endometrial aromatase immunostaining using a polyclonal antibody was a common finding in infertile patients compared with controls.Lack of endometrial ?3 integrin expression is associated with a poor prognosis for IVF that might be improved with letrozole co-treatment. Prospective studies are needed to confirm and extend these findings but the data suggest that aromatase expression may contribute to implantation failure in some women.									21	2	1	15	0	24			0268-1161	1460-2350		WOS:000300510100031	22246449

Non-standard work schedules and retention in the entry-level hourly workforce								JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY				85	1			1	22		10.1348/096317910X526803			MAR 2012	2012	Non-standard work schedules involve work outside the MondayFriday daytime hours. Although research has heavily studied the health and family effects of such schedules, few studies have investigated their relationship to retention. We draw from Maertz and Campion's discussion of motivational forces that influence turnover to propose that employees on non-standard schedules are more likely to quit their employer because of general job dissatisfaction and because of normative pressures from family and/or friends. Specifically, we hypothesized that employees on day shifts or weekday only schedules would remain with their employer longer than those who work on nonday shifts or on the weekends. We also hypothesized that perceived employment mobility would moderate the effects of non-standard schedules on retention length. Hypotheses were tested among 3,178 retail employees who worked five different distinct shift arrangements and different weekday/weekend schedules. Cox regression analyses indicated that, as hypothesized, employees working nonday shifts or schedules including weekends remained with their employer for a shorter duration of time than employees not on such schedules. Perceived mobility moderated the scheduleturnover relationship, though not in the hypothesized manner. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings for work schedule assignment and retention strategies.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0963-1798	2044-8325		WOS:000300699700001

Standard and Ultra Polish CoCr samples were characterized using non-contact surface profilometry and SEM. The Ultra Polish process showed aggressive surface carbide removal, leaving behind large randomized pitted areas on CoCr. The trading of carbide peaks for pitted valleys, resulted no statistical change in surface roughness average (Ra) or dynamic CoF between Standard and Ultra Polish Treated groups. Mean Valley Roughness (R-vm) was better able to quantify changes in surface morphology seen in this study. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The technique involves modeling each characteristic using response surface designs and then transforming the characteristics into a single performance measure. The traditional procedure, however, calls for estimating only the mean response: the variability among the characteristics is not considered. Furthermore, the approach typically relies on the accuracy of second-order polynomials in its estimation, which are not always suitable. This paper, in contrast. proposes a methodology that utilizes higher-order estimation techniques and incorporates the concepts of robust design to account for process variability. Several examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Published by Elsevier Ltd.									9	1	0	1	0	10			0360-8352			WOS:000300751300005

Retrospective coalescent methods and the reconstruction of metapopulation histories in the sea								EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY				26	2	SI		291	315		10.1007/s10682-011-9467-9			MAR 2012	2012	Phylogeographic analyses are a key interface between ecological and evolutionary ways of knowing because such analyses integrate the cumulative effects of demographic (ecological) processes over geological (evolutionary) time scales. Newly developed coalescent methods allow evolutionary ecologists to overcome some limitations associated with inferring population history from classic methods such as Wright's F (ST). Here we briefly contrast classic and coalescent methods for looking backward in time through a population genetic lens, focusing on the key advantages of the isolation-with-migration (IM) class of coalescent methods for distinguishing ancient connectedness from actual recurrent contemporary gene flow as causes of genetic similarity or differentiation among populations. Making this critical distinction can lead to the discovery of otherwise obscured histories underlying conventional patterns of spatial variation. We illustrate the importance of these insights using analyses of Pacific fishes, snails, and sea stars in which population sizes and divergence times are more important than rates of contemporary gene flow as determinants of population genetic differentiation. We then extend the IM method to genetic data from two model metapopulation species (California abalone, Australian damselfish). The analyses show the potential use of non-equilibrium IM methods for differentiating among metapopulation models that make different predictions about population parameters and have different implications for the design of marine protected areas and other conservation goals. At face value, the results largely rule out classic metapopulation dynamics (dominated by extinction and colonization rather than connectivity via ongoing recurrent gene flow) but, at the same time, do not strongly support a modern marine metapopulation dynamic (ecologically significant connectivity between demes). However, the results also highlight the need for much more data (i.e., loci) sampled on different spatial scales in order to determine whether metapopulation dynamics might exist on smaller scales than are typically sampled by most phylogeographers and landscape geneticists.									9	0	0	10	0	10			0269-7653	1573-8477		WOS:000300549800005

Investigating Factors That influence item Performance on ACS Exams								JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION				89	3			346	350		10.1021/ed101175f			MAR 2012	2012	General chemistry tests from the Examinations Institute of the Division of Chemical Education of the American Chemical Society have been analyzed to identify factors that may influence how individual test items perform. In this paper, issues of item order (position within a set of items that comprise a test) and answer order (position of correct answer relative to incorrect distractors) are discussed. Answer order is identified as potentially important, particularly for conceptually based items. When the correct answer appears earlier among the answer choices, there is some greater propensity for student performance to be better. Item-order effects are also possible, particularly when students encounter several challenging items consecutively. Performance on the next item may be lower than expected, possibly because of cognitive-load effects.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0021-9584			WOS:000300546800009

One primary cause of low back pain is the degeneration of the intetvertebral disc (IVD) resulting in the compression of the spinal nerves and adjacent vertebrae. Exact causes of degeneration are unknown, but it is thought that natural aging, and both biological and genetic factors may play a significant role in the degenerative process. Conventional methods to alleviate low back pain include spinal fusion and artificial disc replacement. Traditional treatments through spinal fusion may eliminate pain yet do not restore disc function and lead to further degeneration of adjacent levels by altering disc biomechanics and natural kinematics. Recently, artificial IVD replacements have started to gain interest, with two IVD implants currently approved in the United States. Although these implants facilitate the preservation of motions and disc space height, they are unable to sustain compressive forces due to their lack of elasticity. In addition, the implants may produce wear debris that can cause osteolysis and other deleterious effects. As an alternative to these conventional approaches, tissue engineered IVD constructs offer the advantage of biointegration while preserving the essential attributes of natural motion and disc space restoration. There is a great need for the development of tissue engineered scaffolds that simulate the natural 3D morphology and microenvironment of the targeted tissue. Scaffolds should facilitate biological transport to satisfy nutrition and waste removal requirements within the IVD. The discrete tissue architectures of the nucleus pulposus (NP) and annulus fibrosus (AF) have posed great challenges to IVD tissue engineering. Current attempts have not been able to satisfy the biological functions and/or mechanical properties of native tissue. Therefore, these current scaffolds are far from satisfactory. This review highlights the challenges met when tissue engineering an IVD, while offering a perspective on which biomaterials and scaffold fabrication methods have the realistic ability to serve as scaffolding constructs for IVD regeneration.

Multifirm studies have largely been dyadic and emphasize transaction costs over cocreation of value. Contemporary environments involve IT investments being made by multiple companies in cooperative, platform-based, and relational arrangements where the objective is to cocreate value. If IT serves as a tool, an output. or is instrumental in generating this cocreated value, then it falls within the cocreation domain of this special issue.

Baseline Sensitivity of Monilinia fructicola from China to the DMI Fungicide SYP-Z048 and Analysis of DMI-Resistant Mutants								PLANT DISEASE				96	3			416	422		10.1094/PDIS-06-11-0495			MAR 2012	2012	Chen, F. P., Fan, J. R., Zhou, T., Liu, X. L., Liu, J. L., and Schnabel, G. 2012. Baseline sensitivity of Monilinia fructicola from China to the DMI fungicide SYP-Z048 and analysis of DMI-resistant mutants. Plant Dis. 96:416-422.Sterol 14 alpha-demethylase inhibitors (DMIs) continue to be important in the management of brown rot of Monilinia spp. worldwide. In this study, the sensitivity of 100 Monilinia fructicola isolates from four unsprayed orchards and two packinghouses in Beijing, China, to the new DMI fungicide SYP-Z048 was evaluated and ranged from 0.003 to 0.039 and 0.016 to 0.047 mu g/ml, respectively. Laboratory mutants resistant to SYP-Z048 were generated using UV irradiation but no mutants occurred spontaneously. Resistance was stable after 10 weekly consecutive transfers on fungicide-free medium. Three parameters, including growth rate, sporulation in vitro, and lesion area, were significantly different when sensitive isolates and resistant mutants were analyzed as groups. Mutants grew more slowly and developed significantly smaller lesions on detached fruit, and their sporulation ability in vitro was reduced. Cross resistance was found between SYP-Z048 and propiconazole (p = 0.82, P < 0.0001) but not between SYP-Z048 and tridemorph, carbendazim, procymidone, azoxystrobin, or pyrimethanil. SYP-Z048 resistance in mutants exhibiting 50% mycelial growth inhibition values greater than 0.3 mu g/ml was correlated with the presence of a mutation in the CYP51 gene that encodes the target protein for DMI fungicides. The mutation caused an amino acid change from tyrosine to phenylalanine at position 136 (Y136F). To our knowledge, this is the first baseline sensitivity of M. fructicola collected from China to a DMI fungicide. The inability of M. fructicola to generate spontaneous DMI-resistant mutants coupled with reduced fitness of Y136F mutants can explain why this target site mutation has not yet emerged as a DMI fungicide resistance determinant in M. fructicola field populations worldwide.									16	3	0	15	1	19			0191-2917	1943-7692		WOS:000300483500013		
J	Roth, Philip L.; Purvis, Kristen L.; Bobko, Philip				Grau, Julian/H-8184-2014				A Meta-Analysis of Gender Group Differences for Measures of Job Performance in Field Studies								JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT				38	2			719	739		10.1177/0149206310374774			MAR 2012	2012	There are multiple views in human resource management and organizational behavior concerning gender differences in measures of job performance. Some researchers suggest that males generally are evaluated higher than females across a variety of situations that include job performance measurement. At the same time, the presence of specific status cues in expectation states theory (EST; similar to the concept of individuating information) suggests that measures of job performance will be more similar than different for males and females. Previous analyses are unclear in their results for the measurement of the construct of job performance because they have included, and/or focused on, additional constructs (e.g., hiring suitability, leadership performance aggregated with leadership satisfaction) or have used student samples in lab experiments. The authors of this article conducted a meta-analysis of job performance measures from field studies. They found that females generally scored slightly higher than males (mean d = -.11, 80% credibility interval of -.33 to .12). Other analyses suggested that, although job performance ratings favored females, ratings of promotion potential were higher for males. Thus, ratings of promotability may deserve further attention as a potential source of differential promotion rates. These findings and processes are discussed within the context of EST.									35	0	0	0	0	35			0149-2063	1557-1211		WOS:000300435500011		
J	Zhao, Zhihui; Holle, Lori; Song, When; Wei, Yanzhang; Wagner, Thomas E.; Yu, Xianzhong								Antitumor and anti-angiogenic activities of Scutellaria barbata extracts in vitro are partially mediated by inhibition of Akt/protein kinase B								MOLECULAR MEDICINE REPORTS				5	3			788	792		10.3892/mmr.2011.694			MAR 2012	2012	The Akt pathway is considered a pivotal player in regulating cell survival, growth, migration and angiogenesis. Disruption of normal Akt/PKB/PTEN signaling frequently occurs in numerous types of human cancers. Therefore, this signaling pathway is regarded as an important target for effective cancer therapeutic strategies. In the present study, methanol extracts from Scutellaria barbata (S. barbata) were determined to be Akt/protein kinase B inhibitory, after screening a panel of 40 traditional Chinese herbs with the Fast Activated Cell-based ELISA (FACE) assay. S. barbata extracts were found to suppress the phosphorylation levels of Akt. This inhibition was Akt kinase-specific as it had no effect on PI3K, the upstream kinase of Akt, whereas the levels of phosphorylated Bad and FHKR, the two downstream targets of Akt, changed as the levels of Akt changed. S. barbata extracts also exhibited cytotoxicity against LoVo and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Furthermore, this extract inhibited the process of in vitro angiogenesis of HUVECs on Matrigel. S. barbata may be a suitable alternative source with which to isolate small molecules for use as Akt kinase inhibitors.									6	3	0	3	0	8			1791-2997			WOS:000300272400035	22160152	
J	Flowers, Lamont A.; Bridges, Brian K.; Moore, James L., III								Concurrent Validity of the Learning and Study Strategies Inventory (LASSI): A Study of African American Precollege Students								JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES				43	2			146	160		10.1177/0021934711410881			MAR 2012	2012	Concurrent validation procedures were employed, using a sample of African American precollege students, to determine the extent to which scale scores obtained from the first edition of the Learning and Study Strategies Inventory (LASSI) were appropriate for diagnostic purposes. Data analysis revealed that 2 of the 10 LASSI scales (i.e., Anxiety and Test Strategies) significantly correlated with a measure of academic ability. These results suggested that scores obtained from these LASSI scales may provide valid assessments of African American precollege students' academic aptitude. Implications for teachers, school counselors, and developmental studies professionals were discussed.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0021-9347			WOS:000300052900003	22454973	
J	Dyckman, Caitlin S.; Paulsen, Kurt								Not in My Watershed! Will Increased Federal Supervision Really Bring Better Coordination Between Land Use and Water Planning?								JOURNAL OF PLANNING EDUCATION AND RESEARCH				32	1			91	106		10.1177/0739456X11426877			MAR 2012	2012	This article challenges the assertion that increased federal leverage would successfully coalesce land and water planning throughout the country. Federalism will have the opposite effect, exacerbating tensions between competing management authorities and increasing the number of disparate policies to which local governments must adhere, as examples illustrate. Alternatively, we argue for enforcement of existing tools and creation of an institutional framework loosely modeled on federal-state-local partnership in transportation metropolitan planning organizations. While land use and water planning merit closer coordination, a more flexible institutional arrangement is preferable to expanded federal authority under the Clean Water Act.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0739-456X			WOS:000300096600007

An atomically abrupt transition between the two complexions (grain boundary stabilized phases) implies the occurrence of a first-order interfacial phase transition associated with a discontinuity in the interfacial excess. This observation supports a grain-boundary complexion theory with broad applications. This transition is atypical in that the monolayer complexion is absent. A model is proposed to explain the bilayer stabilization and the origin of this complexion transition. (C) 2011 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Geraldson, Carl T.; Stephenson, James E.; Lagrew, James P.; Schammel, Christine M.; Schammel, David P.; Greene, Ryan A.; Bolton, William D.								Use of Positron Emission Tomography in Initial Staging of Nonsmall Cell Lung Carcinoma: A Regional Teaching Hospital Experience								AMERICAN SURGEON				78	3			305	308					MAR 2012	2012	The ability to accurately diagnose mediastinal lymph node involvement is significantly important in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has become a standard technique to assess lymph node involvement in patients with NSCLC. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of PET scan imaging as a mediastinal staging tool in patients with NSCLC at our regional teaching institution. We performed a single-institution, retrospective review of patients diagnosed with NSCLC from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2007. We included only those patients who underwent computed tomography (CT), PET, and pathologic assessment of mediastinal lymph nodes. Using pathologic assessment as the criterion standard, the overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of CT and PET were calculated. One hundred seventeen patients were identified for inclusion in the study. The overall accuracy was 81.2 per cent for CT and 91.5 per cent for PET. Sensitivity was 42.1 per cent for CT and 52.6 per cent for PET. Specificity was 88.8 per cent for CT and 99.0 per cent for PET. Positive predictive values were 42.1 per cent for CT and 90.9 per cent for PET; negative predictive values were 88.8 per cent for CT and 91.5 per cent for PET. False-negative result rates were 9.4 per cent for CT and 7.7 per cent for PET; false-positive result rates were 9.4 per cent for CT and 0.9 per cent for PET. Our analysis confirms the use of PET scan imaging in the staging of patients with NSCLC at a regional teaching institution.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0003-1348	1555-9823		WOS:000208953300038	22524768	
J	Liang, Jiaqi; Venayagamoorthy, Ganesh K.; Harley, Ronald G.								Wide-Area Measurement Based Dynamic Stochastic Optimal Power Flow Control for Smart Grids With High Variability and Uncertainty								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID				3	1			59	69		10.1109/TSG.2011.2174068			MAR 2012	2012	To achieve a high penetration level of intermittent renewable energy, the operation and control of power systems need to account for the associated high variability and uncertainty. Power system stability and security need to be ensured dynamically as the system operating condition continuously changes. A wide-area measurement based dynamic stochastic optimal power flow (DSOPF) control algorithm using the adaptive critic designs (ACDs) is presented in this paper. The proposed DSOPF control replaces the traditional AGC and secondary voltage control, and provides a coordinated AC power flow control solution to the smart grid operation in an environment with high short-term uncertainty and variability. The ACD technique, specifically the dual heuristic dynamic programming (DHP), is used to provide nonlinear optimal control, where the control objective is explicitly formulated to incorporate power system economy, stability and security considerations. The proposed DSOPF controller dynamically drives the power system to its optimal operating point by continuously adjusting the steady-state set points sent by the traditional OPF algorithm. A 12-bus test power system is used to demonstrate the development and effectiveness of the proposed DSOPF controller.									29	4	0	0	0	33			1949-3053			WOS:000325427200006

Thermal annealing was then carried out at various temperatures in the range from 500 to 700 degrees C for 10 min. Atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and photoluminescence were carried out to investigate the effects of the annealing temperature on the properties of the ZnO thin films. The ZnO thin films exhibit a mountain-range-like surface. With increasing annealing temperature, the grain size increased and the residual stress decreased. The activation energy of the free exciton (FX) emission from the ZnO thin films was found to be about 32 meV and the fitting parameters in Varshni's empirical equation were alpha = 2 x 10(-3) eV/K and beta = 1200 K. The photoluminescence (PL) intensity ratio of near-band-edge emission to deep-level emission of the ZnO thin films increased with increasing annealing temperature.

J	Taydas, Zeynep; Peksen, Dursun								Can states buy peace? Social welfare spending and civil conflicts								JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH				49	2			273	287		10.1177/0022343311431286			MAR 2012	2012	This study examines whether the state's ability to provide social welfare services has any major effect on the probability of civil conflict onset. We argue that welfare spending contributes to sustaining peace because the provision of social services reduces grievances by offsetting the effects of poverty and inequality in society. Welfare spending serves as an indication of the commitment of the government to social services and reflects its priorities and dedication to citizens. By enacting welfare policies that improve the living standards of citizens, governments can co-opt the political opposition and decrease the incentives for organizing a rebellion. Utilizing time-series, cross-national data for the 1975-2005 period, the results indicate that as the level of the government investment in welfare policies (i.e. education, health, and social security) increases, the likelihood of civil conflict onset declines significantly, controlling for several other covariates of internal conflict. Additional data analysis shows that general public spending and military expenditures are unlikely to increase or decrease the probability of civil unrest. Overall, these findings suggest that certain types of public spending, such as welfare spending, might have a strong pacifying effect on civil conflict, and therefore the state's welfare efforts are vital for the maintenance of peace.									19	0	0	0	0	19			0022-3433	1460-3578		WOS:000302633700001

J	Owczarczak, Alexander B.; Shuford, Stephen O.; Wood, Scott T.; Deitch, Sandra; Dean, Delphine								Creating Transient Cell Membrane Pores Using a Standard Inkjet Printer								JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS					61					e3681	10.3791/3681			MAR 2012	2012	Bioprinting has a wide range of applications and significance, including tissue engineering, direct cell application therapies, and biosensor microfabrication.(1-10) Recently, thermal inkjet printing has also been used for gene transfection.(8,9) The thermal inkjet printing process was shown to temporarily disrupt the cell membranes without affecting cell viability. The transient pores in the membrane can be used to introduce molecules, which would otherwise be too large to pass through the membrane, into the cell cytoplasm. (8,9,11)The application being demonstrated here is the use of thermal inkjet printing for the incorporation of fluorescently labeled g-actin monomers into cells. The advantage of using thermal ink-jet printing to inject molecules into cells is that the technique is relatively benign to cells. (8, 12) Cell viability after printing has been shown to be similar to standard cell plating methods(1,8). In addition, inkjet printing can process thousands of cells in minutes, which is much faster than manual microinjection. The pores created by printing have been shown to close within about two hours. However, there is a limit to the size of the pore created (similar to 10 nm) with this printing technique, which limits the technique to injecting cells with small proteins and/or particles. (8,9,11)A standard HP DeskJet 500 printer was modified to allow for cell printing. (3, 5, 8) The cover of the printer was removed and the paper feed mechanism was bypassed using a mechanical lever. A stage was created to allow for placement of microscope slides and coverslips directly under the print head. Ink cartridges were opened, the ink was removed and they were cleaned prior to use with cells. The printing pattern was created using standard drawing software, which then controlled the printer through a simple print command. 3T3 fibroblasts were grown to confluence, trypsinized, and then resuspended into phosphate buffered saline with soluble fluorescently labeled g-actin monomers. The cell suspension was pipetted into the ink cartridge and lines of cells were printed onto glass microscope cover slips. The live cells were imaged using fluorescence microscopy and actin was found throughout the cytoplasm. Incorporation of fluorescent actin into the cell allows for imaging of short-time cytoskeletal dynamics and is useful for a wide range of applications.(13-15)									2	0	0	2	0	2			1940-087X			WOS:000209222800024

Azimuthally Varying Guided Mode Resonance Filters								MICROMACHINES				3	1			180	193		10.3390/mi3010180			MAR 2012	2012	New and novel sensing schemes require optical functions with unconventional spatial light distributions, as well as complex spectral functionality. Micro-optical elements have shown some flexibility in their ability to spatially encode phase information using surface relief dielectrics. In this paper, we present a novel optical component that exploits the properties of optically resonant structures to make an azimuthally spatially varying spectral filter. The dispersive properties are quite unique with an angular resonance shift of 28 Deg/nm. This device is fabricated using techniques that are compatible with standard micro-electronic fabrication technologies.									3	0	0	0	0	3			2072-666X			WOS:000325012300016

A rigorous and complete numerical analysis of the scheme is given, and numerical experiments are presented that show clear advantages of the scheme. (c) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Spatial stratification of host-seeking Diptera in boreal forests of northern Europe								MEDICAL AND VETERINARY ENTOMOLOGY				26	1			56	62		10.1111/j.1365-2915.2011.00963.x			MAR 2012	2012	The stratification of haematophagous Diptera was assessed in two boreal forests in northern Sweden by placing traps baited with carbon dioxide at 1.5 m, 5.0 m and 10.0 m above the ground. More than 40 000 specimens were captured, including 617 biting midges (Ceratopogonidae), 4029 mosquitoes (Culicidae) and 36 092 black flies (Simuliidae). Catches at the various trap heights reflected the general vertical distribution of the preferred hosts, with mammalophilic flies predominating (68.6%) in catches at 1.5 m and ornithophilic flies (42.4%) in catches at 10.0 m; however, most flies that use host birds at ground level were caught in the lowest traps (e.g. 85.1% of Simulium annulus were collected at 1.5 m). Within-species variation in vertical patterns between forests suggests plasticity in responses to environmental factors such as vegetative structure.									3	0	0	2	0	3			0269-283X			WOS:000299333500008	21592156

Multilevel models integrated with geographically weighted regressions were employed to analyze the spatially varying association between area disadvantages and obesity. The dependent variable was body mass index calculated from respondents' self-reported weight and height. The key explanatory variable was a township disadvantage index made of poverty level, minority composition, and social disorder. Other individual socio-demographic characteristics were included to account for the compositional effect.Results: The association between township disadvantages and elevated obesity risk in Taiwan was found to be area-specific. In contrast to results from the commonly used global regression, geographically weighted regression model showed that township disadvantages elevated obesity level only in certain areas.Conclusions: We found heterogeneity of place-level determinants of obesity across geographical areas. Adoption of population approach to curb obesity would require area-specific strategies for most needed areas. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to accurately model the ABL velocity profile at laboratory scale, it is important to establish the shear velocity u*, surface roughness z(0), and zero plane displacement d in either a wind tunnel or water flume. Current techniques for establishing these parameters are based on either an analysis of the boundary layer surface geometry or iterative curve fitting techniques that use mean velocity and/or turbulent kinetic energy profiles, occasionally combined with empirical correlations for z(0). A new curve fitting method for calculating these logarithmic velocity profile parameters is presented. This new method calculates u*, z(0), and d directly from time-averaged velocity profile data in just two steps without any iteration. A comparison is presented between the results of the new method and other available methods applied to a range of velocity profile measurements in air and water. The comparison shows that, although the new method requires less data and fewer steps, it calculates u*. and z(0) with greater accuracy than existing techniques, and d with equivalent accuracy to existing techniques.

The secretion of allelochemicals was regulated by keeping the donor plant (chicory) separate from the three target plant species and using different pH and nitrogen levels. Leachates from donor pots with different pH levels and nitrogen concentrations continuously irrigated the target pots containing the seedlings. The allelopathic effects of the chicory at equivalent coupling of nitrogen supply and pH level on the three target plants species were explored via models analyses. The results suggested a positive effect of nitrogen supply and pH level on allelochemical secretion from chicory plants. The nitrogen supply and pH level were located at a rectangular area defined by 149 to 168 mg/l nitrogen supply combining 4.95 to 7.0 pH value and point located at nitrogen supply 177 mg/l, pH 6.33 when they were in equivalent coupling effects; whereas the inhibitory effects of equivalent coupling nitrogen supply and pH level were located at rectangular area defined by 125 to 131 mg/l nitrogen supply combining 6.71 to 6.88 pH value and two points respectively located at nitrogen supply 180 mg/l with pH 6.38 and nitrogen supply 166 mg/l with pH 7.59. Aqueous extracts of chicory fleshy roots and leaves accompanied by treatment at different sand pH values and nitrogen concentrations influenced germination, seedling growth, soluble sugar, MDA and chlorophyll of F. arundinacea, T. repens and M. sativa. Additionally, we determined the phenolics contents of root and leaf aqueous extracts, which were 0.104% and 0.044% on average, respectively.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1932-6203			WOS:000302875500033	22384054

To further characterize the emissions of methane and non-methane hydrocarbons (propane, n-butane, i-pentane, n-pentane and benzene) around BAO, a pilot study involving automobile-based surveys was carried out during the summer of 2008. A mix of venting emissions (leaks) of raw natural gas and flashing emissions from condensate storage tanks can explain the alkane ratios we observe in air masses impacted by oil and gas operations in northeastern Colorado. Using the WRAP Phase III inventory of total volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from oil and gas exploration, production and processing, together with flashing and venting emission speciation profiles provided by State agencies or the oil and gas industry, we derive a range of bottom-up speciated emissions for Weld County in 2008. We use the observed ambient molar ratios and flashing and venting emissions data to calculate top-down scenarios for the amount of natural gas leaked to the atmosphere and the associated methane and non-methane emissions. Our analysis suggests that the emissions of the species we measured are most likely underestimated in current inventories and that the uncertainties attached to these estimates can be as high as a factor of two.									148	0	0	58	0	152			2169-897X			WOS:000300796000002		
J	Masana, R.; Daqaq, M. F.								Energy harvesting in the super-harmonic frequency region of a twin-well oscillator								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS				111	4					044501	10.1063/1.3684579			FEB 15 2012	2012	Nonlinear dynamical systems exhibit super-harmonic resonances that can activate large-amplitude motions at fraction integers of the fundamental frequency of the system. Such resonances offer a unique and untapped opportunity for harnessing vibratory energy from excitation sources with low-frequency components. To that end, this paper exploits the super-harmonic frequency bands of a nonlinear twin-well (bi-stable) oscillator for harvesting energy from low-frequency excitations. Theoretical and experimental studies are performed on an axially loaded clamped-clamped piezoelectric beam harvester with bi-stable potential characteristics. Voltage- and power-frequency bifurcation maps are generated near the super-harmonic resonance of order two. It is shown that, for certain base acceleration levels, the harvester can exhibit responses that are favorable for energy harvesting. These include a unique branch of large-orbit periodic inter-well oscillations, coexisting branches of large-orbit solutions, and a bandwidth of frequencies where a unique chaotic attractor exists. In these frequency regions, the harvester can produce power levels at half its fundamental frequency that are comparable to those obtained near the fundamental frequency.

Preparation of high-performance membrane adsorbers by surface-initiated AGET ATRP in the presence of dissolved oxygen and low catalyst concentration								JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE				390				43	47		10.1016/j.memsci.2011.10.057			FEB 15 2012	2012	This contribution describes the first use of surface-initiated AGET (activators generated by electron transfer) ATRP (atom transfer radical polymerization) to prepare high-capacity adsorptive membranes for bioseparations. The present advancement greatly simplifies membrane development by overcoming the need for specialized catalyst handling and solution de-oxygenation steps that are required for standard ATRP methods. Furthermore, it enables modification to be done with ppm-level catalyst concentrations. Surface-initiated AGET ATRP from base cellulose membranes was used to prepare amine-based anion-exchange membranes. No precautions were taken to remove oxygen from the system, and catalyst concentrations were 50-200 ppm. A set of experiments was carried out to optimize the molar amount of reducing agent used in formulation. Catalyst concentration and polymerization time were used as independent variables to study the effects on protein binding capacity of the surface-modified membranes. Bind-and-elute measurements were done with an adsorptive membrane bed to measure dynamic protein binding capacities and to demonstrate the highly favorable transport properties of the membrane bed.

Calibration of fringe projection profilometry with bundle adjustment strategy								OPTICS LETTERS				37	4			542	544					FEB 15 2012	2012	The measurement accuracy of fringe projection profilometry (FPP) largely depends on the calibration procedure. A more reliable calibration approach based on the stereo vision model of the FPP scheme in conjunction with the bundle adjustment strategy is presented. It can adjust the coordinates of benchmarks and thereby estimate the scheme parameters more accurately even with an imperfect target. The experiment results shows that the proposed approach can reach highly accurate calibration by solely using a printed target pattern, which verifies the proposed approach.

Whispering gallery modes are excited in a 46 mu m diameter germanium microsphere resonator using evanescent coupling from a tapered silica optical fiber with a waist diameter of 2 mu m. Resonances with Q factors as high as 3.8 x 10(4) at wavelengths near 2 mu m are observed. Because of their ultrahigh optical nonlinearities and extremely broad transparency window, germanium microsphere resonators offer the potential for optical processing devices, in particular at long wavelengths, such as around 2 mu m.

Quantitative analysis of polydisperse systems via solvent-free matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry								RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY				26	3			392	398		10.1002/rcm.5308			FEB 15 2012	2012	Quantitative analysis of partially soluble and insoluble polydisperse materials is challenging due to the lack of both appropriate standards and reliable analytical techniques. To this end, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) incorporating a solvent-free sample preparation technique was investigated for the quantitative analysis of partially soluble, polydisperse, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) oligomers. Molecular weight standards consisting of narrow molecular weight dimer and trimer oligomers of the starting M-50 petroleum pitch were produced using both dense-gas/supercritical extraction (DGE/SCE) and preparative-scale, gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The validity of a MALDI-based, quantitative analysis technique using solvent-free sample preparation was first demonstrated by applying the method of standard addition to a pitch of known composition. The standard addition method was then applied to the quantitative analysis of two insoluble petroleum pitch fractions of unknown oligomeric compositions, with both the dimer and trimer compositions of these fractions being accurately determined. To our knowledge, this study represents the first successful MALDI application of solvent-free quantitative analysis to insoluble, polydisperse materials.

These nanocomposite materials offer a unique combination of high porosity (e.g., similar to 84% void space), electrical conductivity, and surface tailorability. The ZrO2/carbon nanocomposites were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis, nitrogen-adsorption porosirnetry, helium pychnometry, powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Comparison was made with templated mesoporous carbon samples prepared without addition of ZrO2. Treatment of the nanocomposites with phenylphosphonic acid was undertaken and shown to result in robust binding of the phosphonic acid to the surface of ZrO2 particles. Incorporation of nanoscale ZrO2 surfaces in the mesoporous composite skeleton offers unique promise as a means for anchoring organophosphonates inside of pores through formation of robust covalent Zr-O-P bonds.									6	1	0	0	0	6			0743-7463			WOS:000300138500026	22248432

The semiconductor TS state has Majorana fermions as localized zero-energy excitations at order parameter defects such as vortices and sample edges. Here we examine the effects of quenched disorder from the semiconductor surface on the stability of the TS state in both electron- and hole-doped semiconductors. By considering the interplay of broken time-reversal symmetry (due to Zeeman splitting) and disorder we derive an expression for the disorder suppression of the superconducting quasiparticle gap in the TS state. We conclude that the effects of disorder can be minimized by increasing the ratio of the spin-orbit energy with the Zeeman splitting. By giving explicit numbers we show that a stable TS state is possible in both electron-and hole-doped semiconductors for experimentally realistic values of parameters. We discuss possible suitable semiconductor materials which should be the leading candidates for the Majorana search in solid state systems.									54	4	0	3	0	56			1098-0121			WOS:000300238500004

The copolymer is prepared using pNIPAM, which governs the thermal properties, and acrylic acid, which provides the electrolyte ions. As the polymer undergoes a thermally activated phase transition, the local environment around the acid groups is reversibly switched, decreasing ion concentration and conductivity. The responsive electrolyte is used to control the activity of redox electrodes with temperature.									12	0	0	0	0	12			0935-9648			WOS:000299944200003	22253076

The X-ray diffraction profiles of ascrobyl palmitate (A beta), R-cyclodextrin (beta-CD), and the IC were characterized by wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD). The formation of inclusion complex induced large shifts in the WAXD signals. Surface morphology images from scanning electron microscopy showed that the IC had a rod shape. TGA analysis demonstrated that the IC had better thermal stability than the AP. The off-flavor profiles of the AP and the IC were analyzed by GC/MS. The IC had less off-flavor byproducts than the AP during oxygen scavenging reaction. The oxygen scavenging capability of the IC was compared with other oxygen scavengers, the AP and iron powder (IP), at two different storage temperatures, 4 and 23 degrees C. The IC had higher oxygen scavenging capability than the AP and the IP at both storage temperatures. The effect of thermal processing on oxygen scavenging capability was also investigated. Only the IC maintained good oxygen scavenging capability after thermal processing. Results demonstrated that the IC can be used as an effective oxygen scavenger.

The objectives of this research were to investigate whether Alb that was initially adsorbed in a manner that induced unfolding that was less than this critical level would undergo further unfolding with time and, if so, whether this would induce the onset of platelet adhesion once this critical level was exceeded. To address these questions, CD spectropolarimetry was used to monitor the structure of Alb on OH- and CH3-functionalized alkanethiol self-assembled monolayer surfaces, with the Alb initially adsorbed under conditions resulting in degrees of unfolding that were below this critical level, and then the adsorbed Alb layers were aged over 6 months in sterile physiological saline at 37 degrees C. Platelet adhesion to Alb was quantified at selected time points via a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay. The results indicate that an adsorbed Alb layer does undergo further structural changes with increasing residence time and supports platelet adhesion once it unfolds beyond the previously determined critical level. These results may be relevant to the clinically observed problem of the onset of late-thrombosis, which occurs on cardiovascular implants such as drug-eluting stents.									16	0	0	9	0	16			0743-7463			WOS:000299864500054	22191731

To this end, the present study focuses on direct sensing schemes for quantifying trace amounts of oil in water using mid-infrared (MIR) evanescent field absorption spectroscopy via fiberoptic chemical sensors. MIR transparent silver halide fibers were utilized as optical transducer for interrogating oil-in-water emulsions via the evanescent field emanating from the waveguide surface, and penetrating the surrounding aqueous environment by a couple of micrometers. Unmodified fibers and fibers surface-modified with grafted epoxidized polybutadiene layers enabled the direct detection of crude oil in a deionized water matrix at the ppm level to ppb concentration level, respectively. Thus, direct chemical sensing of crude oil IR signatures without any sample preparation as low as 46 ppb was achieved with a response time of a few seconds.									13	0	0	4	0	13			0003-2700			WOS:000299863200015	22103793

Autonomous exploration using rapid perception of low-resolution image information								AUTONOMOUS ROBOTS				32	2			115	128		10.1007/s10514-011-9262-z			FEB 2012	2012	We present a technique for mobile robot exploration in unknown indoor environments using only a single forward-facing camera. Rather than processing all the data, the method intermittently examines only small 32x24 downsampled grayscale images. We show that for the task of indoor exploration the visual information is highly redundant, allowing successful navigation even using only a small fraction of the available data. The method keeps the robot centered in the corridor by estimating two state parameters: the orientation within the corridor, and the distance to the end of the corridor. The orientation is determined by combining the results of five complementary measures, while the estimated distance to the end combines the results of three complementary measures. These measures, which are predominantly information-theoretic, are analyzed independently, and the combined system is tested in several unknown corridor buildings exhibiting a wide variety of appearances, showing the sufficiency of low-resolution visual information for mobile robot exploration. Because the algorithm discards such a large percentage of the pixels both spatially and temporally, processing occurs at an average of 1000 frames per second, thus freeing the processor for other concurrent tasks.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0929-5593	1573-7527		WOS:000299515700002

A large body of research has identified variables associated with bullies, victims, and bully-victims in terms of predictive and preventative factors. However, less attention has been given to the role federal legislation and litigation has played in schools being held more accountable for bullying that may involve discriminatory practices based on disability. Students who have some obvious physical or cognitive disability are at greater risk for being bullied. When they retaliate, they are often considered bully-victims when, in reality, they are only trying to protect themselves in a manner consistent with their oftentimes limited skills. Students with emotional or behavioral disorders (EBD) are at particular risk for displaying bully-victim characteristics. The first purpose of this article is to describe legislative mandates and relevant litigation on bullying and harassment so that schools are better positioned to react appropriately and swiftly when bullying involving students with disabilities occurs. The second purpose is to describe evidence-based practices schools can implement for preventing bullying and responding to it appropriately.									9	0	0	1	0	9			0198-7429			WOS:000304776600002

Reactive molten core fabrication of glass-clad amorphous and crystalline oxide optical fibers								OPTICAL MATERIALS EXPRESS				2	2			153	160					FEB 1 2012	2012	Described herein are glass-clad optical fibers, fabricated using a molten core fiber draw process, comprising oxide cores in the Bi2O3 - GeO2 system. More specifically, the fibers utilized a borosilicate glass cladding with core compositions in the initial preform ranging from un-reacted crystalline Bi2O3-rich (Bi2O3 + GeO2) powders to stoichiometric crystalline Bi12GeO20. Fibers drawn from the as-purchased crystalline Bi2O3-rich powders were amorphous with a transmission of about 80% at 1.3 mu m. Fibers drawn from the crystalline Bi12GeO20 core contained a mixture of crystalline bismuth germanate (Bi2GeO5) and bismuth oxide (delta-Bi2O3/BiO2-x). While representing an initial proof-of-concept, this work shows that commercially-relevant draw processing can be employed to yield fibers with core composition that are very difficult to fabricate using conventional methods and that the molten core method further enables in situ reactive chemistry to take place during fiberization resulting in amorphous or crystalline oxide core fibers depending on initial core composition. Perhaps more importantly is that optical fibers possessing acentric, hence optically nonlinear, oxide crystals can be realized in a scalable manufacturing manner though further optimization is required both of the core chemistry and process conditions in order to achieve a single phase and single crystalline fiber.

Comparing transect survey and WSR-88D radar methods for monitoring daily changes in stopover migrant communities								JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY				83	1			61	72		10.1111/j.1557-9263.2011.00356.x			FEB 2012	2012	For decades, researchers have successfully used ground-based surveys to understand localized spatial and temporal patterns in stopover habitat use by migratory birds. Recent technological advances with WSR-88D radar now allow such investigations on much broader spatial scales. Both methods are assumed to accurately quantify patterns in migrant bird communities, yet information is lacking regarding relationships between radar estimates of migration and different ground-based monitoring methods. From 2005 to 2007, we monitored migrant communities on or near two Department of Defense installations in the spring (Ft. Polk Military Complex, LA; U.S. Army Test and Evaluation Command, Yuma Proving Ground, AZ) and on two installations in the fall (Ft. Polk Military Complex, LA; Eglin Air Force Base, FL) using both ground-based transect surveys and radar imagery of birds aloft. We modeled daily changes in migrant abundance and positive and negative species turnover measured on the ground as a function of radar estimates of migrant exodus and input densities. Radar data were not significant predictors of any response variable in any season either in the southeastern or southwestern United States, indicating a disparity between the results obtained using different methods. Multiple unique sources of error associated with each technique likely contributed to the conflicting outcomes, and researchers should take great care when selecting monitoring methods appropriate to address research questions, effects of management practices, or when comparing the results of migration studies using different survey techniques.									5	0	0	4	0	5			0273-8570	1557-9263		WOS:000300765600008

Batsch], trees showing columnar (also termed pillar or broomy) growth habit are of interest for high-density production systems. While the selection of the pillar homozygous phenotype (brbr) can be carried out prior to field planting, the intermediate heterozygous upright phenotype is difficult to distinguish from standard trees until they are quite large in the field. Application of marker-assisted selection would be helpful in establishing more efficient breeding programmes developing pillar and upright varieties. Thirty-four amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers and three simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers identified by bulked segregant analyses mapped together with the br gene on linkage group 2 (LG 2) of the Prunus reference map. The linkage group covers 92.9 cM. The AFLP marker ETGM61_291R mapped with 4.8 cM to the br gene on one side and the closest AFLP markers ETAM56_267A, ECAM61_426A and ETAM48_279A with 3.8 cM on the other side. These four AFLP markers were sequenced, and two, ETGM61_291R and ETAM48_279A, were successfully converted into sequence-tagged site (STS) markers for marker-assisted selection. BLAST searches against the peach genome placed the br gene in the region 17-18 Mb on LG 2.									11	0	0	11	0	11			0179-9541	1439-0523		WOS:000302150700027

Shock-Wave Attenuation and Energy-Dissipation Potential of Granular Materials								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				21	2			167	179		10.1007/s11665-011-9954-8			FEB 2012	2012	The propagation of uniaxial-stress planar shocks in granular materials is analyzed using a conventional shock-physics approach. Within this approach, both compression shocks and decompression waves are treated as (stress, specific volume, particle velocity, mass-based internal energy density, temperature, and mass-based entropy density) propagating discontinuities. In addition, the granular material is considered as being a continuum (i.e., no mesoscale features like grains, voids, and their agglomerates are considered). However, while the granular material is treated as a (smeared-out) continuum, it is recognized that it contains a solid constituent (parent matter), and that the structurodynamic properties (i.e., Equations of State (EOS) and Hugoniot relations) of the granular material are related to its parent matter. Three characteristic shock loading regimes of granular material are considered and, in each case, an analysis is carried out to elucidate shock attenuation and energy dissipation processes. In addition, an attempt is made to identify a metric (a combination of the material parameters) which quantifies the intrinsic ability of a granular material to attenuate a shock and dissipate the energy carried by the shock. Toward that end, the response of a typical granular material to a flat-topped compressive stress pulse is analyzed in each of the three shock loading regimes.									9	0	0	1	0	9			1059-9495			WOS:000301798200004

An impact study was conducted in a midsize U.S. metropolitan area on the potential of utilizing VII communication in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) operations by simulating a VII-enabled vehicle framework for both conventional HEV and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV). The data collection and communication capability of the VII system allowed the prediction of speed profiles at the vehicle level with an average error rate of 13.2%. With the prediction, at the individual vehicle level, VII technology allowed PHEV and HEV to achieve additional benefits with an approximately 3% decrease in total energy consumption and emission. At the network level, the benefit-cost analysis indicated that the benefit-cost ratios for PHEV and HEV of the VII vehicle network exceed one at the fleet penetration rate of 20% and 30%, respectively. Our findings encourage to support public and private investments in VII infrastructure and its integration with HEV and PHEV in order to reap the increased energy savings from these vehicles.

Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and [D-6]DMSO solutions of 1-4 were oxidised in air to produce vanadium(V) species, which were verified by ESI-MS and V-51 NMR spectroscopy. The anticancer properties of 2-4 were examined with three colon cancer cell lines, HTC-116, Caco-2 and HT-29, and noncancerous colonic myofibroblasts, CCD18-Co. Compounds 2-3 exhibited less inhibitory effects in the CCD-18Co cells, which indicates a possible cytotoxic selectivity towards colon cancer cells. In general, compounds that exhibit antiproliferative activity to cancer cells but do not affect noncancerous cells may have a potential in chemotherapy.									18	0	0	5	0	18			1434-1948			WOS:000301490900008	23904789

The two systems, at redshift z = 3.5673 and 3.5774 (separation Delta v approximate to 660 km s(-1)), are dominated by the neutral gas in the interstellar medium of the parent galaxies. From the singly ionized zinc and sulphur, we estimate oversolar metallicities of [Zn/H] = +0.29 +/- 0.10 and [S/H] = +0.67 +/- 0.34, in the blue and red absorber, respectively. These are the highest metallicities ever measured in galaxies at z > 3. We propose that the two systems trace two galaxies in the process of merging, whose star formation and metallicity are heightened by the interaction. This enhanced star formation might also have triggered the birth of the GRB progenitor. As typically seen in star-forming galaxies, the fine-structure absorption Si II* is detected, both in z = 3.5774 +/- 0.0005 and 3.5673 +/- 0.0003. From the rest-frame ultraviolet emission in the GRB location, we derive a relatively high, not corrected for dust extinction, star formation rate approximate to 6 M circle dot yr(-1). These properties suggest a possible connection between some high-redshift GRB host galaxies and high-z massive submillimetre galaxies, which are characterized by disturbed morphologies and high metallicities. Our result provides additional evidence that the dispersion in the chemical enrichment of the Universe at high redshift is substantial, with the existence of very metal-rich galaxies less than two billion years after the big bang.									51	1	0	0	0	52			0035-8711			WOS:000301284600068

We seek clarification of the nature of X-ray sources detected in M 31. Here we focus on CXOM31 J004253.1+411422, the brightness of which suggests that it belongs to the class of ultraluminous X-ray sources.Aims. We determine the X-ray properties of sources detected in the XMM-Newton/Chandra monitoring program. We investigate spectral properties and search for periodic or quasi-periodic oscillations.Methods. A multicomponent model was applied to the spectra obtained from XMM-Newton data to evaluate the relative contributions from thermal and nonthermal emission. The time dependence of this ratio was evaluated over a period of forty days. We simultaneously fit data from XMM-Newton EPIC-pn, MOS1, and MOS2 detectors with (nonthermal) powerlaw and (thermal) multicolored blackbody.Results. The X-ray spectrum is best fit by the combination of a thermal component with kT similar to 1 keV and a powerlaw component with a photon index of approximately 2.6. From combined analysis of Chandra, Swift, and XMM-Newton data, the unabsorbed total luminosity of this source decreases from similar to 3.8 x 10(39) erg s(-1) in the first observation to similar to 0.5 x 10(39) erg s(-1) over a period of three months. The decay closely follows an exponential decline with a time constant of 32 days. The source spectrum evolves significantly, exhibiting a faster decline of the thermal component. We do not find evidence of any significant temporal features in the power density spectrum. The presence of a thermal component at kT similar to 1 keV in conjunction with a nonthermal high-energy tail, is also consistent with spectral properties of other ULXs in the "high state".Conclusions. Our analysis indicates that the underlying source of this first ULX in M 31 is a black hole of mass, M >= 13 M-circle dot, accreting near the Eddington limit, that underwent a transient outburst followed by an exponential decay reminiscent of transients associated with galactic X-ray novae.									14	0	0	0	0	14			0004-6361			WOS:000300614100049

The Swift discovery of the short burst GRB 090510 has raised considerable attention mainly because of two reasons: first, it had a bright optical afterglow, and second it is among the most energetic events detected so far within the entire GRB population (long plus short). The afterglow of GRB 090510 was observed with Swift/UVOT and Swift/XRT and evidence of a jet break around 1.5 ks after the burst has been reported in the literature, implying that after this break the optical and X-ray light curve should fade with the same decay slope.Aims. As noted by several authors, the post-break decay slope seen in the UVOT data is much shallower than the steep decay in the X-ray band, pointing to a (theoretically hard to understand) excess of optical flux at late times. We assess here the validity of this peculiar behavior.Methods. We reduced and analyzed new afterglow light-curve data obtained with the multichannel imager GROND. These additional g' r' i' z data were then combined with the UVOT and XRT data to study the behavior of the afterglow at late times more stringently.Results. Based on the densely sampled data set obtained with GROND, we find that the optical afterglow of GRB 090510 did indeed enter a steep decay phase starting around 22 ks after the burst. During this time the GROND optical light curve is achromatic, and its slope is identical to the slope of the X-ray data. In combination with the UVOT data this implies that a second break must have occurred in the optical light curve around 22 ks post burst, which, however, has no obvious counterpart in the X-ray band, contradicting the interpretation that this could be another jet break.Conclusions. The GROND data provide the missing piece of evidence that the optical afterglow of GRB 090510 did follow a post-jet break evolution at late times. The break seen in the optical light curve around 22 ks in combination with its missing counterpart in the X-ray band could be due to the passage of the injection frequency across the optical bands, as already theoretically proposed in the literature. This is possibly the first time that this passage has been clearly seen in an optical afterglow. In addition, our results imply that there is no more evidence for an excess of flux in the optical bands at late times.									12	0	0	0	0	12			1432-0746			WOS:000300614100160

Observations of the.-ray sky with Fermi led to significant advances towards understanding blazars, the most extreme class of active galactic nuclei. A large fraction of the population detected by Fermi is formed by BL Lacertae (BL Lac) objects, whose sample has always suffered from a severe redshift incompleteness due to the quasi-featureless optical spectra.Aims. Our goal is to provide a significant increase of the number of confirmed high-redshift BL Lac objects contained in the 2 LAC Fermi/LAT cataloge.Methods. For 103 Fermi/LAT blazars, photometric redshifts using spectral energy distribution fitting have been obtained. The photometry includes 13 broad-band filters from the far ultraviolet to the near-IR observed with Swift/UVOT and the multi-channel imager GROND at the MPG/ESO 2.2 m telescope. Data have been taken quasi-simultaneously and the remaining source-intrinsic variability has been corrected for.Results. We release the UV-to-near-IR 13-band photometry for all 103 sources and provide redshift constraints for 75 sources without previously known redshift. Out of those, eight have reliable photometric redshifts at z greater than or similar to 1.3, while for the other 67 sources we provide upper limits. Six of the former eight are BL Lac objects, which quadruples the sample of confirmed high-redshift BL Lac. This includes three sources with redshifts higher than the previous record for BL Lac, including CRATES J0402-2615, with the best-fit solution at z approximate to 1.9.									33	1	0	0	0	33			0004-6361			WOS:000300614100026		
J	Grove, Stephen J.; Pickett, Gregory M.; Jones, Scott A.; Dorsch, Michael J.								Spectator Rage as the Dark Side of Engaging Sport Fans: Implications for Services Marketers								JOURNAL OF SERVICE RESEARCH				15	1			3	20		10.1177/1094670511428166			FEB 2012	2012	Customer rage is a complex phenomenon that is beginning to receive attention from researchers and practitioners. To date, research into the phenomenon has focused exclusively on its occurrence within a failed service context; however, rage may also occur in nonfailure situations as a negative by-product of an organization's efforts to engage the customer at an emotional level. As a service entity, the live sporting event is characterized by a number of features which make it particularly susceptible to acts of rage. This article examines rage within the context of spectator sport by utilizing a framework that is capable of organizing and focusing attention upon those factors that shape a fan's consumption experience and render spectator sport, and services in general, susceptible to rage. Services marketers may be unable to eliminate all incidents of spectator rage, especially those that arise when a customer becomes excessively and emotionally absorbed with the service encounter. Nevertheless, fans' propensity to rage may be reduced by understanding the factors that contribute to it and by carefully designing servicescapes and vigilantly managing customer interactions to generate exhilarating, yet nonaggressive, customer experiences.									11	0	0	0	0	11			1094-6705			WOS:000300506500001

This example of a dual-mode surface, which combines both passive and active modes of antibiofouling, works in synergy to Improve the overall antibiofouling efficiency against bamacle cyprids. The HBFP-PEG polymer surface, prior to modification with NA, was analyzed by atomic force microscopy, and a significant distribution of topographical features was observed, with a nanoscopic roughness measurement of 110 +/- 8 nm. NA attachment to the surface was probed by secondary ion mass spectrometry to quantify the extent of polymer chain-end substitution with NA, where a 3- to 4-fold increase in intensity for a fragment ion associated with NA was observed and 39% of the available sites for attachment were substituted. Cytoskeletal assays confirmed the activity of tethered NA on adhering oyster hemocytes. Settlement assays showed deterrence toward barnacle cyprid settlement, while not compromising the passive biofouling resistance of the surface. This robust strategy demonstrates a methodology for the incorporation of actively antibiofouling moieties onto a passively antibiofouling network.									25	1	0	5	0	25			1936-0851			WOS:000300757900060	22276525

Atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy, and photoluminescence (PL) were carried out to investigate the structural and optical properties of the PS and the ZnO thin films. The ZnO thin films have an extraordinary tendency to grow along the a-axis with a hexagonal wurtzite structure. The growth rate of the ZnO thin films was increased with the increase in the precursor concentration. The crystal quality of the ZnO thin films was improved, and the residual stress was decreased as their thickness increased. Monochromatic indigo and red light emission peaks were observed from the ZnO thin films and the PS, respectively. At an excessively high precursor concentration, a green light emission peak was also observed in the ZnO thin films. The luminescent efficiency of the indigo light emission peak was enhanced with the increase in the precursor concentration.									12	0	0	0	0	12			1738-8090			WOS:000301023800015

In addition, improved resistance to some foliar diseases and viruses has also been reported in grafted plants. Hence, grafting technology is considered an important and innovative practice of integrated pest management and a promising alternative for soil fumigants in vegetable production. Inherent resistance within rootstocks and improved plant nutrient uptake are generally suggested as the main reasons for improved disease control in grafted vegetables. However, increasing evidence indicated that systemic defense mechanisms may also play an important role in plant defense as a result of grafting. This review analyzes current literature on the use of grafting techniques for disease management in vegetable crops, discusses potential mechanisms associated with grafting-conferred plant defense, and identifies needs for future research to promote more effective and efficient use of grafting technology to support sustainable vegetable production.									15	1	0	12	0	16			0018-5345			WOS:000300919900001

This study was performed to overcome the volatility of AITC by encapsulation using gum Arabic and chitosan and to investigate the effect of microencapsulated AITC as a natural additive on the shelf-life and quality of Kimchi. AITC loaded microparticles were prepared using gum Arabic and chitosan and were added to Kimchi at various concentrations (0-0.02%, w/w). The titratable acidity, pH, microbial changes, and sensory test of Kimchi were examined for 15 days at different fermentation temperatures (4 and 10 degrees C). The pH of Kimchi containing AITC microparticles was significantly higher than that of control and the higher the quantity of added AITC, the higher the pH became. The titratable acidity of Kimchi increased during storage especially, titratable acidity of control increased significantly higher than those of Kimchi with added AITC microparticles. The number of Leuconostoc and Lactobacillus species in Kimchi decreased with an increase in the concentration of AITC. The addition of AITC induced reduction of sour taste and improvement of the texture of Kimchi during fermentation. However, as the content of AITC increased, the scores of overall acceptability decreased due to the odor of AITC. These results indicate that addition of AITC (less than 0.1%) to Kimchi is an effective way of enhancing the shelf-life of Kimchi without reducing quality. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Temperature-dependent PL was carried out to investigate the mechanism governing the quenching behavior of the PL spectra. From the PL spectra of the ZnO soccer balls at 10 K, several PL peaks were observed at 3.365, 3.318, 3.249, and 3.183 eV corresponding to excitons bound to neutral donors ((DX)-X-o), a donor-acceptor pair (DAP), first-order longitudinal optical phonon replica of donor-acceptor pair (DAP-1LO), and DAP-2LO, respectively. The mixed system composed of the free exciton (FX) and (DX)-X-o and the DAP radiative lifetimes were estimated with a theoretical relation between the lifetime and the spectral width. The exciton radiative lifetimes were observed to increase linearly with temperature. (C) 2012 The Japan Society of Applied Physics									5	0	0	0	0	5			0021-4922			WOS:000300627200008

The defective boundary condition problem is formulated as a minimization problem, where we seek boundary conditions of the flow equations which yield an optimal functional value. Two different approaches are considered in developing computational algorithms for the constrained optimization problem, and results of numerical experiments are presented to compare performance of the algorithms.

Glucose responsive biotransducers were prepared by potentiostatic electropolymerization [750 mV vs. Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl)] of pyrrole at Poly(hydoxyethyl methacrylate)-based hydrogel-coated Pt micro-electrodes (I broken vertical bar = 100 mu m) from aqueous solutions of pyrrole and glucose oxidase (GOx; 0.4 M pyrrole, 1.0 mg/ml GOx) to 1.0 and 10.0 mC/cm(2). Polypyrrole was them over-oxidized by cyclic voltammetry (0-1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl, 40 cycles in PBKCl, pH = 7.0). Biotransducers were stored at 4 A degrees C in PBKCl for up to 18 days. Amperometric dose-response at 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl followed by Lineweaver-Burk analysis produced enzyme kinetic parameters as a function of electropolymerization charge density and storage time. Apparent Michaelis constant (K (Mapp)) increased from 18.6-152.0 mM (1.0 mC/cm(2)) and from 2.7-6.1 mM (10.0 mC/cm(2)). Biotransducer sensitivity increased to 21.2 nA/mM after 18 days and to 12.8 pA/mM after 10 days for the 1.0 and 10.0 mC/cm(2) membranes, respectively. Maximum current, I (max), also increased over time to 2.7 nA (1.0 mC/cm(2)) and to 170 pA (10.0 mC/cm(2)). Electropolymerization of polypyrrole is shown to be an effective means for imparting bioactivity to a hydrogel-coated microelectrode. GOx was shown to be stabilized and to increase activity over time within the electroconductive hydrogel.									13	0	0	4	0	13			0273-2289			WOS:000300296700006	22212391

Acute pancreatitis in two five-day-old Appaloosa foals								EQUINE VETERINARY JOURNAL				44		SI		96	99		10.1111/j.2042-3306.2011.00435.x		41	FEB 2012	2012	Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) in foals is rare and treatment has not been documented. This paper describes the clinical, haematological and ultrasonographic findings as well as attempted treatment of SAP in two 5-day-old Appaloosa fillies. Clinical signs, including colic, diarrhoea and coma, may be mistaken for sepsis or neonatal encephalopathy. Hyperlipaemic serum and peritoneal fluid, and elevated serum and peritoneal fluid amylase and lipase activities aided the diagnosis. Severe acute pancreatitis should be included as a differential in an acutely ill foal with diarrhoea, colic, cerebral cortical dysfunction and hyperlipaemia.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0425-1644			WOS:000300005100020

Traditional spectrum sensing requires the secondary radios to refrain from communicating while they check for the emergence of primary signals. We propose and evaluate methods by which the secondary radios can continue their communications while simultaneously monitoring the band to detect any transmissions that are initiated by the primary radios. Our methods for spectrum monitoring supplement traditional spectrum sensing and improve the communications efficiency of the secondary radios.									25	5	0	0	0	29			0090-6778			WOS:000300424800030

Two modes of radiation are considered: a patch-antenna mode and a monopole-antenna mode. The maximum emissions are the sum of the emissions due to each of these modes. Circuit board dimensions are assumed to be large compared to the heatsink dimensions. The most relevant parameters affecting the emissions are the dimensions of the heatsink. The closed-form expression is validated by comparing its results to full-wave simulation results for a variety of heatsink sizes and shapes.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0018-9375			WOS:000300509300027

Automated tools to detect unacceptable levels of coupling during the board layout rely on fast methods for estimating the amount of coupling and the resulting radiated emissions. A modeling technique is proposed to speed up the analysis of PCBs with coupled traces that induce common-mode currents on attached cables. Based on the concept of imbalance difference, differential-mode sources are converted to equivalent common-mode sources that drive the attached cable and the PCB reference plane. A closed-form expression based on the imbalance difference model is developed to estimate the maximum radiated emissions due to I/O line coupling in PCBs.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0018-9375			WOS:000300509300028

Soldiers completed measures of noncommissioned officer (NCO) and officer leadership, stigma, and practical barriers to getting mental health treatment at 2, 3, and 4 months following a 15-month deployment to Afghanistan. The results revealed that positive and negative NCO and officer leader behaviors were predictive of overall stigma and barriers to care (collapsed across the three time periods), with only NCO positive and negative behaviors being uniquely predictive of stigma when included in the same model with officer behaviors. In addition, negative and positive NCO leader behaviors were predictive of stigma within participants over the course of the three month time period, and positive NCO leader behaviors were inversely related to practical barriers to mental health treatment within participants across the same time period. The results are discussed in terms of how different leader behaviors may be linked to different factors influencing a soldier's decision to seek mental health treatment.									18	0	0	1	0	18			1541-1559			WOS:000300541400003	22449085

New Lithium Measurements in Metal-Poor Stars								PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC				124	912			164	172		10.1086/664618			FEB 2012	2012	We provide lambda 6708 Li I measurements in 37 metal-poor stars, most of which are poorly studied or have no previous measurements, from high-resolution and high-S/N spectroscopy obtained with the McDonald Observatory 2.1 m and 2.7 m telescopes. The typical line-strength and abundance uncertainties, confirmed by the thinness of the Spite plateau manifested by our data and by comparison with previous measurements, are <= 4 m angstrom and <= 0.07-0.10 dex, respectively. Two rare moderately metal-poor solar-T-eff dwarfs, HIP 36491 and 40613, with significantly depleted but still detectable Li are identified; future light-element determinations in the more heavily depleted HIP 40613 may provide constraints on the Li depletion mechanism acting in this star. We note two moderately metal-poor and slightly evolved stars, HIP 105888 and G265-39, that appear to be analogs of the low-Li moderately metal-poor subgiant HD 201889. Preliminary abundance analysis of G265-39 finds no abnormalities that suggest that the low Li content is associated with AGB mass transfer or deep mixing and p-capture. We also detect line doubling in HIP 4754, heretofore classified as SB1.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0004-6280			WOS:000300641300006

In this paper we demonstrate the role of transverse mode competition on laser oscillation in such a fiber laser. It enables single, lowest-order mode lasing with a beam quality of M-2 < 2 when using a combination of large fiber core radius and low output coupler reflectivity previously considered to rule out gain-guided index antiguided lasing with such beam quality. In addition, the larger core radii fibers and low output coupler reflectivity enables improved slope efficiency. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results are presented demonstrating mode competition governed lasing in a gain-guided, index antiguided fiber. c (C) 2012 Optical Society of America									7	1	0	0	0	8			0740-3224			WOS:000300407300020

Herein, SNP profiles for 197 GSDs were generated using the Affymetrix v2 canine SNP array for a genome-wide association study to identify loci associated with four diseases: pituitary dwarfism, degenerative myelopathy (DM), congenital megaesophagus (ME), and pancreatic acinar atrophy (PAA). A locus on Chr 9 is strongly associated with pituitary dwarfism and is proximal to a plausible candidate gene, LHX3. Results for DM confirm a major locus encompassing SOD1, in which an associated point mutation was previously identified, but do not suggest modifier loci. Several SNPs on Chr 12 are associated with ME and a 4.7 Mb haplotype block is present in affected dogs. Analysis of additional ME cases for a SNP within the haplotype provides further support for this association. Results for PAA indicate more complex genetic underpinnings. Several regions on multiple chromosomes reach genome-wide significance. However, no major locus is apparent and only two associated haplotype blocks, on Chrs 7 and 12 are observed. These data suggest that PAA may be governed by multiple loci with small effects, or it may be a heterogeneous disorder.									9	0	0	8	1	10			0938-8990			WOS:000300317600016	22105877

We characterize the structure of functions with a given depth and compute the expected activities and sensitivities of the variables. This analysis quantifies how canalyzation leads to higher stability in Boolean networks. It generalizes the notion of nested canalyzing functions (NCFs), which are precisely the functions with maximum depth. NCFs have been proposed as gene regulatory network models, but their structure is frequently too restrictive and they are extremely sparse. We find that functions become decreasingly sensitive to input perturbations as the canalyzing depth increases, but exhibit rapidly diminishing returns in stability. Additionally, we show that as depth increases, the dynamics of networks using these functions quickly approach the critical regime, suggesting that real networks exhibit some degree of canalyzing depth, and that NCFs are not significantly better than functions of sufficient depth for many applications of the modeling and reverse engineering of biological networks.									9	0	0	4	0	9			0092-8240			WOS:000299750300008	22139748

Trypanosoma brucei: Inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase by haloxyfop								EXPERIMENTAL PARASITOLOGY				130	2			159	165		10.1016/j.exppara.2011.10.014			FEB 2012	2012	Trypanosoma brucei, a eukaryotic pathogen that causes African sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in cattle, depends on the enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) for full virulence in mice. ACC produces malonyl-CoA, the two carbon donor for fatty acid synthesis. We assessed the effect of haloxyfop, an aryloxyphenoxypropionate herbicide inhibitor of plastid ACCs in many plants as well as Toxoplasma gondii, on T. brucei ACC activity and growth in culture. Haloxyfop inhibited TbACC in cell lysate (EC50 67 mu M), despite the presence of an amino acid motif typically associated with resistance. Haloxyfop also reduced growth of bloodstream and procyclic form parasites (EC50 of 0.8 and 1.2 mM). However, the effect on growth was likely due to off-target effects because haloxyfop treatment had no effect on fatty acid elongation or incorporation into complex lipids in vivo.

In situ observations were obtained by NASA sounding rocket 36.234, which was launched into the nightside E region ionosphere at 1229 UT on 19 January 2007 from Poker Flat, AK. The payload carried instrumentation to determine ion drift angle and electric field vectors. Neutral winds were measured by triangulating a chemical tracer released from rocket 41.064 launched two minutes later. kappa is calculated from the rotation of the ion drift angle relative to the E-cross-B drift direction in a frame co-rotating with the payload. Between the altitudes of 118 km and 130 km kappa increases exponentially with a scale height of 9.3 +/- 0.7 km, deviating from an exponential above 130 km. kappa = 1 at an altitude z(0) of 119.9 +/- 0.5 km. The ratio was also estimated from Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar (PFISR) measurements using the rotation of ion velocity with altitude. Exponential fits to the PFISR measurements made during the flight of 41.064 yield z(0) = 115.9 +/- 1.2 km and a scale height of 9.1 +/- 1.0 km. Differences between in situ and ground-based measurements show that the E region atmospheric densities were structured vertically and/or horizontally on scales of 1 km to 10 km. There were no signs of ionospheric structure in ion density or ion temperature below scales of 1 km. The observations demonstrate the accuracy with which the in situ and PFISR data may be used as probes of IT coupling.									4	1	0	0	0	5			2169-9380	2169-9402		WOS:000299989700002

Such quantification is useful in many statistical inferences involving autocovariances. While joint asymptotic normality of the sample autocovariances is well-known in univariate settings, explicit forms of the asymptotic covariances have not been investigated in the general multivariate non-Gaussian case. We fill this gap by providing such an analysis, bookkeeping all skewness terms. Additionally, following a recent univariate paper by Francq and Zakoian, we consider linear processes driven by non-independent errors, a feature that permits consideration of multivariate GARCH processes.

The solution combustion synthesis method has been used to synthesize many different oxides, including luminescent ones. However, a systematic investigation of the dopant homogeneity at the nanoscale in materials produced by this method is lacking. This is of particular relevance in nanophosphors due to the possibility of concentration quenching. In this work, 5 at.% Tb-doped Y2O3 was prepared by the solution combustion synthesis method and investigated on its structure and chemical composition homogeneity at the nanoscale by means of electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), high resolution TEM, X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence measurements. The results show that it is possible to prepare luminescent materials by the solution combustion synthesis method where the dopant is homogeneously distributed within each nanoparticle.

We present experiments using a mobile robot, pan-tilt unit and laser.

Numerical simulations of the development and dewatering of the mine workings are based on idealizing the mine-workings system as two overlapping continua, one representing the open drifts and the other representing the host rock with hydrologic properties that vary with effective stress. Equating macroscopic hydrologic properties with characteristics of deformable fractures allows the number of parameters to be reduced, and it provides a physically based justification for changes in properties with depth. The simulations explain important observations, including the co-existence of shallow and deep flow systems, the total dewatering flow rate, the spatial distribution of in-flow, and the magnitude of porosity in the mine workings. The analysis indicates that a deep flow system induced by similar to 125 years of mining is contained within a surface-truncated ellipsoid roughly 8 km by 4 km in plan view and 5.5 km deep with its long-axis aligned to the strike of the workings. Groundwater flow into the southern side of the workings is characterized by short travel times from the ground surface, whereas flow into the northern side and at depth consists of old water removed from storage.									4	0	0	1	0	4			1431-2174			WOS:000299706800003

Differential Sensitivity to Boscalid in Conidia and Ascospores of Didymella bryoniae and Frequency of Boscalid-Insensitive Isolates in South Carolina								PLANT DISEASE				96	2			228	234		10.1094/PDIS-06-11-0490			FEB 2012	2012	Keinath, A. P. 2012. Differential sensitivity to boscalid in conidia and ascospores of Didymella bryoniae and frequency of boscalid-insensitive isolates in South Carolina. Plant Dis. 96:228-234.Since 2003, a 2:1 mixture of the fungicides boscalid and pyraclostrobin (Pristine) has been used widely on watermelon and other cucurbits, primarily to control gummy stem blight caused by Didymella bryoniae. Several isolates of D. bryoniae that were insensitive to boscalid at 10 mg/liter were found in a watermelon research plot in South Carolina in 2008. In total, 201 isolates collected between 1998 and 2009 were tested for sensitivity to boscalid by determining percentage germination of ascospores and conidia on media amended with boscalid at 0.01 to 10.0 mg/liter. All 31 isolates collected in 1998, 2002, or 2005 were sensitive to boscalid. Of the 170 isolates collected in or after 2006, 84.7% were insensitive to boscalid, including 19 of 30 isolates recovered from greenhouse-grown seedlings. The oldest insensitive isolates were obtained in 2006 from a greenhouse and in 2008 from a commercial field. Ascospores were less sensitive to boscalid than conidia. With boscalid at 1.0 mg/liter, 22.4% of ascospores but only 4.1% of conidia of 31 sensitive isolates germinated. Similarly, a mean of 68.6% of the ascospores and 54.1% of the conidia of 120 insensitive isolates germinated at 1.0 and 10.0 mg/liter. The 50% effective concentration (EC50) values based on ascospore germination were two to three times higher than values based on conidia germination. The significance of miscalculating EC50 values by considering only conidia was demonstrated in a greenhouse experiment. Twelve isolates that were sensitive, moderately insensitive, or highly insensitive based on conidia germination did not differ in relative virulence on boscalid-treated muskmelon seedlings when inoculum suspensions comprised ascospores alone or ascospores and conidia. This is the first report of differential sensitivity to a fungicide between conidia and ascospores in D. bryoniae. Because D. bryoniae produces conidia and ascospores on diseased hosts, both spore types should be used when calculating EC50 values for boscalid.									10	0	0	10	0	10			0191-2917			WOS:000299394900007		
J	Atamturktur, Sezer; Laman, Jeffrey A.								Finite element model correlation and calibration of historic masonry monuments: review								STRUCTURAL DESIGN OF TALL AND SPECIAL BUILDINGS				21	2			96	113		10.1002/tal.577			FEB 2012	2012	Building a reliable finite element (FE) model of historic masonry structures is a difficult undertaking due to the challenges in accurate representation of irregular geometry, complex material behaviour and complicated boundary conditions between structural masonry components. Model calibration refers to correcting the inherent deficiencies within the FE model by matching outputs to measured data. Model calibration has the potential to produce more reliable computer models and thus aid in the economical management and maintenance of contemporary as well as heritage structures. Researchers involved in the assessment of historic masonry monuments have devoted decades of consistent attention to FE model calibration. This paper reviews the recent developments in this topic with a focus on complex vaulted masonry monuments. Studies on simpler forms of masonry structures, such as masonry arch bridges or masonry towers, are also discussed since they lay the groundwork for studies on more complex structures. This paper identifies several remaining technical challenges as model calibration approaches gain wider recognition and usage in historic monument structural assessment.

J	Wolfe, Dylan; Novak, David R.								'What bubbles up': the experience of nature-based art								VISUAL COMMUNICATION				11	1			23	48		10.1177/1470357211424676			FEB 2012	2012	This study combines participant observation and photovoice documentation to examine the experience of site-specific, nature-based art. Twenty-four participants generated 70 pages of written narrative and 139 photographs during 72 collective hours at the South Carolina Botanical Garden. The sculpture program's stated goal of producing unique, extra-ordinary experiences for garden visitors is evaluated through analyses of the participants' observations and photographs. The authors argue that participants' initial reactions are marked by tensions created when the site-specific, nature-based characteristics of the artwork fail to live up to expectations of orderly arrangement and comprehensible utility. However, the tension generated through the apparent failure to generate immediate comprehension and appreciation is found to be ultimately resolved through contemplative engagement. The unexpected encounter with an unmarked formation, deliberate yet naturalized, offers the viewer an experience beyond the order and utility that generally define our world.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1470-3572			WOS:000299470500002

SMS is typically caused by a large deletion on 17p11.2 that encompasses multiple genes including the retinoic acid induced 1, RAI1, gene or a mutation in the RAI1 gene. Here we have evaluated 30 patients with suspected SMS and identified SMS-associated classical 17p11.2 deletions in six patients, an atypical deletion of similar to 139 kb that partially deletes the RAI1 gene in one patient, and RAI1 gene nonsynonymous alterations of unknown significance in two unrelated patients. The RAI1 mutant proteins showed no significant alterations in molecular weight, subcellular localization and transcriptional activity. Clinical features of patients with or without 17p11.2 deletions and mutations involving the RAI1 gene were compared to identify phenotypes that may be useful in diagnosing patients with SMS.

J	Higham, Timothy E.; Russell, Anthony P.								Time-varying motor control of autotomized leopard gecko tails: multiple inputs and behavioral modulation								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY				215	3			435	441		10.1242/jeb.054460			FEB 2012	2012	Autotomy (voluntary loss of an appendage) is common among diverse groups of vertebrates and invertebrates, and much attention has been given to ecological and developmental aspects of tail autotomy in lizards. Although most studies have focused on the ramifications for the lizard (behavior, biomechanics, energetics, etc.), the tail itself can exhibit interesting behaviors once segregated from the body. For example, recent work highlighted the ability of leopard gecko tails to jump and flip, in addition to being able to swing back and forth. Little is known, however, about the control mechanisms underlying these movements. Using electromyography, we examined the time-varying in vivo motor patterns at four sites (two proximal and two distal) in the tail of the leopard gecko, Eublepharis macularius, following autotomy. Using these data we tested the hypothesis that the disparity in movements results simply from overlapping pattern generators within the tail. We found that burst duration, but not cycle duration, of the rhythmic swings reached a plateau at approximately 150 s following autotomy. This is likely because of physiological changes related to muscle fatigue and ischemia. For flips and jumps, burst and cycle duration exhibited no regular pattern. The coefficient of variation in motor patterns was significantly greater for jumps and flips than for rhythmic swings. This supports the conclusion that the different tail behaviors do not stem from overlapping pattern generators, but that they rely upon independent neural circuits. The signal controlling jumps and flips may be modified by sensory information from the environment. Finally, we found that jumps and flips are initiated using relatively synchronous activity between the two sides of the tail. In contrast, alternating activation of the right and left sides of the tail result in rhythmic swings. The mechanism underlying this change in tail behavior is comparable to locomotor gait changes in vertebrates.									8	0	0	8	0	8			0022-0949			WOS:000299310200013	22246252	
J	Warren, Patrick L.								Independent auditors, bias, and political agency								JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS				96	1-2			78	88		10.1016/j.jpubeco.2011.08.008			FEB 2012	2012	This paper analyzes political agency with endogenous information collection and revelation by third-party auditors. While increasing incentives for auditors to provide information straightforwardly improves political control, a small amount of pro-incumbent bias can also be useful for maintaining high levels of control. When the equilibrium level of control is high, most investigations uncover positive information about the incumbent. Since positive information increases reelection rates, mildly pro-incumbent auditors are willing to work harder than unbiased auditors in these equilibria. For moderate levels of control, pro-incumbent auditors are again useful due to their extra effort, even though they may suppress some negative information in equilibrium. Only when market incentives are low, so equilibrium control is weak, are unbiased or anti-incumbent biased auditors better for voters than mildly pro-incumbent auditors. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Lentiviral-Mediated RNAi Knockdown Yields a Novel Mouse Model for Studying Cyp2b Function								TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES				125	2			368	381		10.1093/toxsci/kfr309			FEB 2012	2012	There are few in vivo knockout models available to study the function of Cyp2 members involved in the metabolism of endogenous and exogenous chemicals. These models may help provide insight into the cytochrome P450s (CYPs) responsible for the detoxification and activation of drugs, environmental toxicants, and endobiotics. The aim of this work is to produce a potent Cyp2b-knockdown (KD) mouse for subsequent study of Cyp2b function. We made a quintuple Cyp2b-KD mouse using lentiviral-promoted short hairpin RNA (shRNA) homologous to all five murine Cyp2b subfamily members (Cyp2b9, 2b10, 2b13, 2b19, and 2b23). The Cyp2b-KD mice are viable, fertile, and without obvious gross abnormalities except for an increase in liver weight. Expression of the three hepatic Cyp2b members, 2b9, 2b10, and 2b13, is significantly repressed as demonstrated by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting. The constitutive androstane receptor activator, 1,4-Bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)] benzene (TCPOBOP), was used to determine if shRNA-mediated Cyp2b10 repression could be outcompeted by Cyp2b10 induction. TCPOBOP-treated Cyp2b-KD mice show 80-90% less Cyp2b protein expression than TCPOBOP-treated wild-type (WT) mice, demonstrating that Cyp induction does not outcompete the repressive function of the shRNA. Untreated and TCPOBOP-treated Cyp2b-KD mice are poor metabolizers of parathion compared with WT mice. Furthermore, Cyp2b-KD mice are sensitive to parathion, an organophosphate insecticide primarily metabolized by Cyp2b enzymes, when compared with WT mice. In summary, we designed an shRNA construct that repressed the expression and activity of multiple Cyp2b enzymes. We foresee that this novel Cyp2b-KD mouse model will significantly improve our understanding of the role of Cyp2b enzymes in chemical sensitivity and drug metabolism.									3	1	0	4	0	4			1096-6080			WOS:000299346000006	22083726

Arsenic Exposure to Killifish During Embryogenesis Alters Muscle Development								TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES				125	2			522	531		10.1093/toxsci/kfr302			FEB 2012	2012	Epidemiological studies have correlated arsenic exposure in drinking water with adverse developmental outcomes such as stillbirths, spontaneous abortions, neonatal mortality, low birth weight, delays in the use of musculature, and altered locomotor activity. Killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) were used as a model to help to determine the mechanisms by which arsenic could impact development. Killifish embryos were exposed to three different sodium arsenite concentrations and were collected at 32 h post-fertilization (hpf), 42 hpf, 168 hpf, or < 24 h post-hatch. A killifish oligo microarray was developed and used to examine gene expression changes between control and 25-ppm arsenic-exposed hatchlings. With artificial neural network analysis of the transcriptomic data, accurate prediction of each group (control vs. arsenic-exposed embryos) was obtained using a small subset of only 332 genes. The genes differentially expressed include those involved in cell cycle, development, ubiquitination, and the musculature. Several of the genes involved in cell cycle regulation and muscle formation, such as fetuin B, cyclin D-binding protein 1, and CapZ, were differentially expressed in the embryos in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Examining muscle structure in the hatchlings showed that arsenic exposure during embryogenesis significantly reduces the average muscle fiber size, which is coupled with a significant 2.1- and 1.6-fold upregulation of skeletal myosin light and heavy chains, respectively. These findings collectively indicate that arsenic exposure during embryogenesis can initiate molecular changes that appear to lead to aberrant muscle formation.									6	1	0	5	0	7			1096-6080			WOS:000299346000019	22058191

Identification and mapping of conserved ortholog set (COS) II sequences of cacao and their conversion to SNP markers for marker-assisted selection in Theobroma cacao and comparative genomics studies								TREE GENETICS & GENOMES				8	1			97	111		10.1007/s11295-011-0424-0			FEB 2012	2012	Theobroma cacao (cacao) is a tree cultivated in the tropics around the world for its seeds that are the source of both chocolate and cocoa butter. Genetic marker development for marker-assisted selection (MAS) is critical for the success of cacao breeding for disease resistance and yield. To develop conserved ortholog set II (COSII) single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for MAS in cacao, we have used three strategies and three types of cacao genetic and sequence data to identify and map 98 cacao COSII genes. The resources available at the time these studies were first undertaken dictated the strategy utilized. For the first strategy, SNPs were identified using cacao expressed sequence tags homologous to COSII sequences. Strategy II utilized a leaf transcriptome of cacao genotype "Matina 1-6" and Strategy III the genomic sequence of a 3-Mb region of "Matina 1-6" linkage group 5 associated with an important quantitative trait locus (QTL) for resistance to black pod. We have identified SNP markers for 83 of the 98 mapped COSII genes, and 19 of these SNP markers co-locate with QTLs. These COSII SNP markers, the first identified for cacao, will be used for genotyping and off-typing in cacao breeding programs and employed for genetic mapping and syntenic studies to trace co-location of genes regulating traits of importance between cacao and other species.									9	2	0	8	0	11			1614-2942			WOS:000299508000009

In addition, the utilization of reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) is an acceptable practice in many states. However, the use of these materials in the Superpave mix design system is not standardized, so it is essential to investigate whether a rubberized asphalt concrete (RAC) mixture containing RAP can be used in the Superpave mix design procedure. In general, the use of RAP in the past has proven to be economical, environmentally sound, and effective for enhancing the engineering properties of asphalt mixtures. Crumb rubber has also been used successfully in improving the mechanical characteristics of an HMA mixture. The objective of this research was to investigate the feasibility of the Superpave mix design of rubberized asphalt mixtures containing RAP through volumetric analysis of various mixtures with respect to crumb rubber type, percentage and RAP percentage in the mixture. The results of this limited study indicated that increasing the rubber content led to an increase of the optimum binder content; the two rubber types had good workability with virgin and RAP mixtures; and the Superpave mix design method and volumetric analysis can be used for the rubberized asphalt mixtures containing RAP.

The students participating in this study attend a coeducational charter middle school with single-sex classrooms. One hundred nineteen sixth-grade students' responses are analyzed by gender according to the solution strategy they used to arrive at their final response to the task. The categories of solution strategies include non-response, purely additive, purely procedural, transition, novice, and mature. The proportions of girls and boys classified as mature in their strategies were essentially equal. However, more than half of girls' responses were considered purely procedural or purely additive-a proportion double that of boys thus classified.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0013-1954			WOS:000298855200009

Despite the amount of new evidence surrounding regulatory focus and its relationships with other variables, a quantitative summary of this literature is lacking. The authors used meta-analysis to summarize correlations from 77 empirical studies that included self-report measures of promotion and prevention focus. Meta-analytic effect sizes between promotion and prevention focus and work-related variables are reported. In general, results indicated that promotion and prevention focus are orthogonal constructs and each construct is uniquely related to other theoretically relevant constructs. The results also demonstrate the importance of regulatory foci to organizational researchers as well as the need for a unified approach to their measurement. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Apart from providing the required single-hit and multi-hit ballistic protection to the vehicle occupants, the armor must also possess and retain optical transparency and be compatible with on-board imaging and communications equipment. In addition, standard low cost and light-weight requirements are also critical in the design and engineering of transparent armor systems. At the present time, the design and fabrication of transparent armor systems is done almost exclusively using empirical, trial-and-error and legacy approaches. Consequently, new transparent armor system development lead times are long, the costs are quite high and many shortcomings of the systems become apparent only after they have been fielded. To help better understand and overcome this situation, a brief overview and discussion of the basic transparent armor architectures, functional layers and transparent materials is provided and a set of design and material selection guidelines is proposed.

J	Alahmer, Ali; Omar, Mohammed; Mayyas, Abdel Raouf; Qattawi, Ala								Analysis of vehicular cabins' thermal sensation and comfort state, under relative humidity and temperature control, using Berkeley and Fanger models								BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT				48				146	163		10.1016/j.buildenv.2011.08.013			FEB 2012	2012	This manuscript discusses the effect of manipulating the Relative Humidity (RH) along with the Dry Bulb Temperature (DBT) on vehicular cabins' environment in terms of the overall thermal comfort and human occupants' thermal sensation. The study uses the Berkeley and the Fanger models to investigate the human comfort through analyzing the (RH) effect from three specific perspectives; firstly its effect on other environmental conditions such as the Dew Point Temperature (DPT), the Enthalpy (H), the vapor pressure (vp) and the humidity ratio (omega) in the cabin. This will be done during the summer and winter periods. Secondly, the cabin local sensation (LS) and comfort (LC) will be analyzed for different body segments mainly; the head, chest, back, hands and feet with the addition of the overall sensation (OS) and the overall comfort (OC). This will be done using a thermal manikin based on the Berkeley model. Thirdly, the human sensation will be measured by the Predicted Mean Value (PMV) and the Predicted Percentage Dissatisfied (PPD) indices during the summer and the winter periods using the Fanger model calculations. From this study and according to the Berkeley model; the RH value should be controlled and synced with the cooling process such that at the early stage (rapid transient) low RH value should be enforced; while a high RH value is needed in the steady state phase. During the start of the heating process (winter conditions), the RH value does not play a major role due to low temperature in the passenger compartment. However, at later periods until the end of the heating process, a low RH value is needed to achieve the needed comfort level. According to Fanger model, in the summer period as the RH value increases, the A/C can achieve the human comfort zone (PMV = -/+ 0.5) in lesser time than if the RH value is not controlled. While in the winter period, as the RH value decreases, the A/C reaches the human comfort zone faster.So, this study shows that controlling the relative humidity along with (DBT) enables the cabin to reach the comfort zone faster than the sole control of the cabin (DBT), in both the cooling and the heating processes i.e. summer and winter conditions respectively.

Model studies indicate that the second addition/elimination on OFCP is fast and polycondensation results in linear homopolymers and copolymers without side products. The synthesis of bis(heptafluorocyclopentenyl) aryl ether monomers and their condensation with bisphenols further led to PFCP copolymers with alternating structures. This new class of semifluorinated polymers exhibit surprisingly high crystallinity in some cases and excellent thermal stability.									17	2	0	2	0	19			0024-9297			WOS:000299366300018

The effects of the Cd mole fraction for CdxZn1-xO seed layers on the structural and optical properties of the ZnO nanorods were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and photoluminescence. The narrowest full-width at half-maximum and largest grain size of the CdxZn1-xO seed layers, indicating improvement in crystal quality, were observed at the Cd mole fraction of 0.5. At the Cd mole fraction of 0.5, the largest enhancement in the density, the crystal quality, and the growth rate of the ZnO nanorods was observed while their appearance was not affected significantly by the incorporation of the Cd in the CdxZn1-xO seed layers. Consequently, the luminescent properties of the ZnO nanorods were enhanced. The largest improvement in the structural and optical properties of the ZnO nanorods was observed at the Cd mole fraction of 0.5.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0253-2964			WOS:000300473700032

The sparsity of the inhomogeneity with respect to a certain basis is a priori assumed. The proposed approach is motivated by a Tikhonov functional incorporating a sparsity-promoting l1-penalty term, and it allows us to obtain quantitative results when the assumption is valid. A novel iterative algorithm of soft shrinkage type was proposed. Numerical results for several two-dimensional problems with both single and multiple convex and nonconvex inclusions were presented to illustrate the features of the proposed algorithm and were compared with one conventional approach based on smoothness regularization.

Max-optimal and sum-optimal labelings of graphs								INFORMATION PROCESSING LETTERS				112	1-2			26	31		10.1016/j.ipl.2011.09.006			JAN 15 2012	2012	Given a graph G, a function f: V (G) -> {1, 2, ..., k} is a k-ranking of G if f (u) = f (v) implies that every u - v path contains a vertex w such that f (w) > f (u). A k-ranking is minimal if the reduction of any label greater than 1 violates the described ranking property. We consider two norms for minimal rankings. The max-optimal norm parallel to f(G)parallel to(infinity) is the smallest k for which G has a minimal k-ranking. This value is also referred to as the rank number chi(r)(G). In this paper we introduce the sum-optimal norm parallel to f(G)parallel to(1) which is the minimum sum of all labels over all minimal rankings. We investigate similarities and differences between the two norms. In particular we show rankings for paths and cycles that are sum-optimal are also max-optimal. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Such methods bypass classic subsegmentation algorithms, which sometimes yield suboptimal conclusions. Minimum description length techniques are introduced. These techniques require optimizing an objective function over all possible changepoint numbers and location times. The general objective functions allow for correlated data, reference station aspects, and/or nonnormal marginal distributions, all common features of climate time series. As an exhaustive evaluation of all changepoint configurations is not possible, the optimization is accomplished via a genetic algorithm that randomly walks through a subset of good models in an intelligent manner. The methods are applied in the analysis of 173 yr of annual precipitation measurements from New Bedford, Massachusetts, and the North Atlantic basin tropical cyclone record.									21	0	0	1	0	21			0894-8755	1520-0442		WOS:000299649600016

Here we report on the atomistic simulation of electroosmotic flows (EOF) in RTILs. We find that, although the EOF is suppressed by the ion-wall electrofriction, its strength greatly exceeds that predicted by classical hydrodynamic theories if correct ion distribution is used and electrofriction effects are effectively accounted for in these theories. We trace the unexpected flow strength to the short-wavelength nature of EOF in RTILs. We show that the EOF in RTILs is a rare example in which short-wavelength hydrodynamics profoundly affects flow measurables in macroscopic systems and thus is a good test bed for developing improved theories for generalized hydrodynamics.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1932-7447			WOS:000298978700139

In this investigation at the fractured rock research site in Floyd County, Virginia, a high-precision borehole extensometer and tiltmeter were used during pumping to monitor deformation in the vicinity of fractures identified from borehole logging. Strain data obtained from earth tide analyses were used with the extensometer and tiltmeter data to quantify hydromechanical properties, including fracture volumetric specific storage, porosity, Poisson's ratio, the drained formation elastic modulus, and the effective dip direction of the fracture. Borehole tiltmeter data were used to estimate deformation caused by an aquifer test consisting of three pumping and recovery periods performed in well EX-1. During each period of the aquifer test the extensometer, located in W-03 and 27.7 m from the pumping well, was anchored over 2-m-long sections of (1) a fracture in hydraulic communication with EX-1, (2) a fracture that is not hydraulically connected with EX-1, and (3) an unfractured portion of bedrock directly above the hydraulically connected fracture. Results from the pumping tests yielded compressibilities of 1.3 x 10(-11) Pa-1, and 1.7 x 10(-11) Pa-1 for the lower and upper fractures, respectively. When coupled with areal strain calculated from earth tide analyses the volumetric specific storage values are 3.2 x 10(-11) Pa-1, and 2.8 x 10(-11) Pa-1 and the Poisson's ratios are 0.26 and 0.31, respectively. Using this with a calculated barometric efficiency of 0.45 allows for porosity calculations of 0.02 and 0.03, respectively for the vicinity of fractures in well W-03. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Danielsen, Scott/0000-0003-3432-5578			Evaluation of Alkylimidazoles as Physical Solvents for CO2/CH4 Separation								INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH				51	1			515	522		10.1021/ie202111k			JAN 11 2012	2012	1-n-Alkylimidazoles are a class of tunable solvents with low volatility and low viscosities. Although imidazoles have been known for some time in the pharmaceutical industry, and as convenient precursors for synthesizing imidazolium-based ionic liquids (ILs), only recently have they been given consideration in some of the same solvent-based separations applications that ILs have been studied for, such as post-combustion CO2 capture and natural gas treating. "Sweetening", the removal of CO2, H2S, and other "acid" gases from natural gas (CH4), is an existing industrial application where low volatility, low viscosity physical solvents are already applied successfully and economically at large scale. Physical solvents are also used for syngas cleanup and in the emerging application of pre-combustion CO2 capture. Given the similarities in physical properties between 1-n-alkylimidazoles, and physical solvents currently used in industrial gas treating, the 1-n-alkylimidazole class of solvents warrants further investigation. Solubilities of CO2 and CH4 in a series of 1-n-alkylimidazoles were measured under conditions relevant to the use of physical solvents for natural gas treating: similar to 5 atm partial pressure of CO2 and temperatures of 30-75 degrees C. Solubilities of CO2 and CH4 were found to be strongly dependent on temperature, with the solubility of each gas in all solvents diminishing with increasing temperature, although CO2 exhibited a stronger temperature dependence than CH4. Ideal CO2/CH4 solubility selectivities were also more favorable at lower temperatures in 1-n-alkylimidazole solvents with shorter chain lengths. CO2 solubility decreased with increasing chain length, while CH4 solubility exhibited a maximum in 1-hexylimidazole. The solubility trends observed with temperature and chain length can be explained through calculation of solution enthalpies and solvent fractional free volume as approximated from van der Waals volumes as calculated via atomic contributions. Of the solvents examined, 1-methylimidazole displays the most favorable CO2 solubility and CO2/CH4 selectivity, and has the lowest viscosity. A comparison of 1-methylimidazole to commercially used solvents reveals similar physical properties and the potential for use in industrial gas processing. Imidazolium-based ILs are also compared, although they appear less favorable for use within established process schemes given their higher viscosities and reduced capacity for CO2.									22	0	0	1	0	22			0888-5885			WOS:000298943200055

In the present study, we have evaluated the effect of four drug resistance mutations (A42G, E104K, G238S, and M182T) on the cefotaximase activity of the TEM-1 beta-lactamase. Using computational methods, including docking and molecular mechanics calculations, we have been able to correctly identify the relative order of catalytic activities associated with these four single point mutants. Further analyses suggest that the changes in catalytic efficiency for mutant enzymes are correlated to structural changes within the binding site. Based on the energetic and structural analyses of the wild-type and mutant enzymes, structural rearrangement is suggested as a mechanism of evolution of drug resistance through TEM beta-lactamase. The present study not only provides molecular-level insight into the effect of four drug resistance mutations on the structure and function of the TEM beta-lactamase but also establishes a foundation for a future molecular-level analysis of complete evolutionary trajectory for this class of enzymes.

The concurrent action of the Rad51 and Dmc1 recombinases is necessary for an interhomolog bias. Notably, the activity of Rad51 is tightly controlled, so as to minimize the use of the sister chromatid as recombination partner. We demonstrated recently that Hed1, a meiosis-specific protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, restricts the access of the recombinase accessory factor Rad54 to presynaptic filaments of Rad51. We now show that Hed1 undergoes self-association in a Rad51-dependent manner and binds ssDNA. We also find a strong stabilizing effect of Hed1 on the Rad51 presynaptic filament. Biochemical and genetic analyses of mutants indicate that these Hed1 attributes are germane for its recombination regulatory and Rad51 presynaptic filament stabilization functions. Our results shed light on the mechanism of action of Hed1 in meiotic recombination control.									9	0	0	9	0	9			0021-9258			WOS:000299170300070	22115747

Heteroleptic platinum(II) and palladium(II) complexes with thiacrown and diimine ligands								POLYHEDRON				31	1			89	97		10.1016/j.poly.2011.08.030			JAN 4 2012	2012	We wish to report the synthesis, crystal structures, spectroscopic and electrochemical properties of several new Pt(II) heteroleptic complexes containing the thiacrown, 9S3 (1,4,7-trithiacyclononane) with a series of substituted phenanthroline ligands and related diimine systems. These five ligands are 5,6-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline(5,6-Me-2-phen), 4,7-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline(4,7-Me-2-phen), 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline(4,7-Ph-2-phen), 2,2'-bipyrimidine(bpm), and pyrazino[2,3-f]quinoxaline or 1,4,5,8-tetraazaphenanthrene(tap). All complexes have the general formula [Pt(9S3)(N-2)](PF6)(2) (N-2 = diimine ligand) and form similar structures in which the Pt(II) center is surrounded by a cis arrangement of the two N donors from the diimine chelate and two sulfur atoms from the 9S3 ligand. The third 9S3 sulfur in each structure forms a longer interaction with the platinum resulting in an elongated square pyramidal structure, and this distance is sensitive to the identity of the diimine ligand. In addition, we report the synthesis, structural, electrochemical, and spectroscopic properties of related Pd(II) 9S3 complex with tap. The Pt-195 NMR chemical shifts for the six Pt(II) complexes show a value near-3290 ppm, consistent with a cis-PtS2N2 coordination sphere although more electron-withdrawing ligands such as tap show resonances shifted by almost 100 ppm downfield. The physicochemical properties of the complexes generally follow the electron-donating or withdrawing properties of the phenanthroline substituents. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, the binding of AgNPs and HSA was analyzed by spectrophotometry, and the induced conformational changes of the HSA were inferred from circular dichroism spectroscopy. The fluidity of the vesicle, a model system for mimicking cell membrane, was found to increase with the increased exposure to AgNP-HSA corona, though less pronounced compared to that induced by AgNPs alone. This study offers additional information for understanding the role of physical forces in nanoparticle-cell interaction and has implications for nanomedicine and nanotoxicology.

IEEE					Generalized Passivity in Discrete-Time Switched Nonlinear Systems								2012 IEEE 51ST ANNUAL CONFERENCE ON DECISION AND CONTROL (CDC)		IEEE Conference on Decision and Control						302	307					2012	2012	This paper analyzes the passivity and feedback passivation problems for discrete-time switched nonlinear systems with both passive and nonpassive modes that have relative degree zero. We generalize the classical passivity definition for such a switched nonlinear system provided that the increase in storage function over a finite horizon is bounded by the total supplied energy during this time period. We further extend this generalized passivity definition to switched nonlinear systems with passive, feedback passive modes and modes which can not be rendered passive using feedback (non-feedback passive modes). The switched nonlinear system is proved to be locally feedback passive if and only if its zero dynamics are locally passive. A lower bound on the ratio of total activation time between (feedback) passive and non-feedback passive modes is obtained to guarantee passive zero dynamics with Lipschitz constraints. We prove that output feedback control can be used to stabilize the equilibrium point of the switched system.					51st IEEE Annual Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)51st IEEE Annual Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	DEC 10-13, 2012DEC 10-13, 2012	IEEE; Soc Ind & Appl Math; Inst Operat Res Management Sci; Japanese Soc Instrument & Control Engineers; European Union Control Assoc; Int Federat Automat Control; Elsevier; GE Global Res; MathWorks; Springer; Univ Hawaii Manoa, Coll Engn; Univ Texas Dallas; Journal Franklin Inst, Engn & Appl Math; Taylor & Francis Grp; Visual Solut; Wolfram ResIEEE; Soc Ind & Appl Math; Inst Operat Res Management Sci; Japanese Soc Instrument & Control Engineers; European Union Control Assoc; Int Federat Automat Control; Elsevier; GE Global Res; MathWorks; Springer; Univ Hawaii Manoa, Coll Engn; Univ Texas Dallas; Journal Franklin Inst, Engn & Appl Math; Taylor & Francis Grp; Visual Solut; Wolfram Res	HIHI	1	0	0	0	0	1			0191-2216		978-1-4673-2066-5	WOS:000327200400050

Previous results in [1], [2] have modeled such electromechanical waves mostly for two-area radial transfer paths (or, equivalently for a two-node line graph) by representing the swing dynamics in terms of partial differential equations (PDEs). Our results extend this approach to a network of areas connected by equivalent transfer paths, and defines an equivalent Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue equation for the entire network. We show that depending on the network topology the solutions of this eigenvalue problem can be significantly different from those for the individual paths. Simulation results for several representative power system network structures confirm our hypothesis.					51st IEEE Annual Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)51st IEEE Annual Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	DEC 10-13, 2012DEC 10-13, 2012	IEEE; Soc Ind & Appl Math; Inst Operat Res Management Sci; Japanese Soc Instrument & Control Engineers; European Union Control Assoc; Int Federat Automat Control; Elsevier; GE Global Res; MathWorks; Springer; Univ Hawaii Manoa, Coll Engn; Univ Texas Dallas; Journal Franklin Inst, Engn & Appl Math; Taylor & Francis Grp; Visual Solut; Wolfram ResIEEE; Soc Ind & Appl Math; Inst Operat Res Management Sci; Japanese Soc Instrument & Control Engineers; European Union Control Assoc; Int Federat Automat Control; Elsevier; GE Global Res; MathWorks; Springer; Univ Hawaii Manoa, Coll Engn; Univ Texas Dallas; Journal Franklin Inst, Engn & Appl Math; Taylor & Francis Grp; Visual Solut; Wolfram Res	HIHI	0	0	0	0	0	0			0191-2216		978-1-4673-2066-5	WOS:000327200400073

Both species were described in the late 1920s from a few locales in Arizona and New Mexico (also Colorado in the case of P. rubroscutellatus); their host-plant relationships have remained undocumented. We give additional distribution records of O. atriscutis from Arizona (3 counties, 6 sites), New Mexico (11 counties, 35 sites), and Texas (3 counties, 3 sites; new state record) and P. rubroscutellatus from Arizona (3 counties, 3 sites) and New Mexico (9 counties, 29 sites). Their seasonal histories are based mainly on regular sampling of Apache plume, Fallugia paradoxa (D. Don) Endl. ex Torr.; Rosaceae), from mid-July 2009 to mid-May 2012 at a Chihuahuan Desert site east of Las Cruces (Dona Ana Co.), New Mexico, where the bugs were syntopic. Supplemental data on seasonality were obtained from periodic collections from Apache plume in southwestern states. Regular sampling near Las Cruces, as well as supplemental collecting, indicated that both restheniines are bivoltine. Overwintered eggs hatched during the last two weeks of March at the main study site, and first-generation adults of both species appeared by mid-April and were present until early May. Nymphs of a second generation were present from early June to October (fifth instars occasionally were found in November), with adults present as late as the end of November. In the Southwest, both plant bugs were found only on Apache plume; the 1926 record of O. atriscutis from "Cowania sp." (Rosaceae) in the Chiricahua Mountains of Arizona is considered an incidental occurrence of adults or a misidentification of Fallugia paradoxa.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1947-5136			WOS:000314080900020

In this context, we consider the placement of relay nodes and individual transmission power assignments. Specifically, given a planar deployment of sensors and a base station, we seek the placement of a limited number of relays and optimal sensor power assignments such that the network is connected. We present a polynomial-time bicriteria approximation algorithm for this problem. We also provide an optimal O(n(2) log n)-time algorithm for a restricted version where nodes lie on a simplified urban grid (that we call a comb-grid). We also study a related variant that assumes fixed transmission power values, with the goal of minimizing the number of relays. We provide extensive simulation results for the comb-grid case.

To support the ever-increasing wireless traffic demand, researchers have worked on the concept of an integrated heterogeneous wireless environment that encompasses several of these RATs which makes the resource allocation process more efficient by assigning each user in the system to the best RAT/RATs. In this paper, for such an integrated heterogeneous wireless system, we show the possible gains in spectral efficiency at the cost of increased energy consumption for an unbalanced heterogeneous wireless network deployment scenario. In prior work, based on the assumption that all cellular operators under study were equally well-provisioned, we showed an increase in spectral efficiency of up to 75%. In the research presented in this paper, we assume the coverage of each operator might differ significantly in a given area. With this 'unbalanced' scenario, we show that an ideal, centralized allocation strategy provides an almost linear tradeoff between gain in spectral efficiency (554%) and worst-case increase in energy consumption (615%) for users supporting elastic traffic.

ASME					COMPARING THE PERFORMANCE OF A NONLINEAR ENERGY HARVESTER IN MONO- AND BI-STABLE POTENTIALS								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE 2011, VOL 1, PTS A AND B: 23RD BIENNIAL CONFERENCE ON MECHANICAL VIBRATION AND NOISE								255	264					2012	2012	The quest to develop broadband vibratory energy harvesters (VEHs) has recently motivated researchers to explore introducing nonlinearities into the harvester's design. Some research efforts have demonstrated that this new class of nonlinear harvesters can outperform their traditional linear (resonant) counterparts; some others however concluded that nonlinearities can diminish the harvester's transduction. Through this effort, we compare the performance of a nonlinear VEH operating in mono- and bi-stable potentials. With that objective, we consider an axially-loaded clamped-clamped piezoelectric beam which functions as an energy harvester in the mono-stable (pre-buckling) and bi-stable (post-buckling) configurations. For the purpose of fair performance comparison, the oscillation frequency around the stable equilibria of the harvester is tuned to equal values in both configurations. The harvester is then subjected to harmonic base excitations of different magnitudes and a slowly-varying frequency which spans a wide range around the tuned oscillation frequency. The output voltage measured across an arbitrarily chosen electric load is used as a relative performance measure. Both numerical and experimental results demonstrate that the shape of the potential function plays an essential role in conjunction with the magnitude of the base excitation to determine whether the bi-stable harvester can outperform the mono-stable one and for what range of frequencies.

A parametric study of electric power generated as a function of the dielectric constant, transverse piezoelectric strain constant, length and thickness of the piezoelectric material, is conducted for a time-harmonic surface pressure load. The reference piezoelectric material used in the design is Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT-5H). Complete transversely isotropic elastic and piezoelectric properties are assigned to the bimorph layers with brass chosen as the substrate material in the three-dimensional finite element model. The numerical analysis shows that a uniform decrease in thickness and length coverage of the piezoelectric layers results in a nonlinear reduction in power amplitude, which suggests optimal values. Using design of experiments (DOE), a study was conducted to determine the sensitivity of power with respect to the geometric and material variables.

ASME					COMPARATIVE STUDIES IN TRACTION CONCEPTS								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, 2011, VOL 8								829	838					2012	2012	The interaction between tires and soft soils is a complex process that has not yet been fully understood. Attempts to create analytical models which realistically simulate these interactions have proven to be exceedingly time consuming for each tire model and have achieved only limited success. Thus, the exploration and evaluation of traction concepts by analytical means is impractical. This paper posits that significantly more reliable, rapid, and cost effective development is achieved through the prototyping and experimental evaluation of traction concepts. Here, three traction prototypes are developed and evaluated by undergraduate teams in the course of an academic semester. These concepts explore the performance of grousers, inverted geometry (dimples), and cellular materials respectively using a wheel endurance and soft-soil traction testing system at Clemson University. Each concept is tested at different acceleration rates from 0-10km/h and at different loads while measuring the slip between the tire and soil surfaces. The results of experimental evaluation indicate that cellular materials present a unique slip profile which is superior to that of the two other purely geometric concepts studied. The worst performance was seen on the inverse geometry concept which presented a behavior of steadily increasing slip with respect to wheel velocity regardless of acceleration. Grousers also presented this behavior but only at higher accelerations. This suggests that not only that prototyping is preferable, but that traditional soft-soil traction approaches may be in error.

In addition, an example of how the method can be used in conjunction with a part redesign process has been shown through topology optimization of an identified part. The LPIM, which was originally developed for the analysis of automobiles, serves as a set of guidelines for novice designers to identify components that have potential for mass reduction. By successfully using the method on a RC car, the method can be shown to be applicable on smaller scale. The analysis of the RC car consisted of using indicators to identify lazy parts, weighing of those parts, and estimation of mass reduction percentages. From this, it was estimated that approximately 5% of the vehicle's weight could be reduced. Once the lazy analysis was completed on the car, a component with a high potential for mass reduction was selected for redesign. Topology optimization using ANSYS Mechanical was done to suggest a new design, which contained regions of material removal. After creating a redesigned part, a new mass was measured and used to validate the original mass reduction estimates from the LPIM. The new part design was also validated through physical experimentation in which the part was fabricated and tested. This paper outlines an entire process for lightweight design from start to finish, beginning with an identification of parts with mass reduction using the Lazy Parts Indicator Method.

This study focuses on the design of a NPT based on properties of vertical stiffness and rolling energy loss. Using a finite element (FE) model, a parametric study is conducted to study the effect on vertical stiffness and RR response considering two design variables; (a) thickness of the spokes, and, (b) the shear band thickness of the NPT. Using the two geometric variables, a design of experiments (DOE) is performed to study the effect on both RR and vertical displacement. Results from the DOE are used to create response surface models (RSM) for both the objective function (minimal RR) and a constraint on vertical deflection. The analytical RSM function is optimized for minimizing the rolling loss subjected to the given constraint. In addition a design sensitivity study is performed to evaluate the influence of the design variables on the output response. Results indicate that both variables have significant effect on RR, with the shear band thickness having the greater effect.

Blanks were pneumatically bulged through four elliptical die inserts, with aspect ratios ranging between 1.0 and 0.4, producing ellipsoidal domes with different biaxial strain combinations. Testing was carried out in two ways: with the major strains being aligned either along or across the rolling direction of the material. Strain combinations were measured in the deformed specimens, and the forming limit curves were constructed for each of the four sheets in two orientations. The results show great impact of sheet orientation on material formability limits. Additionally, the results reveal significant differences between the four sheets; those differences were correlated back to disparities in grain structure and material inhomogeneities.

For the purpose of the study, an energy harvester consisting of a clamped-clamped piezoelectric beam bi-morph is considered. The shape of the harvester's potential function is altered by applying a static compressive axial load at one end of the beam. The axial load permits the harvester to operate with different potential energy characteristics; namely,. the mono-stable (pre-buckling) and bi-stable (post-buckling) configurations. The performance of the harvester in both configurations is investigated and compared by tuning the harvester's oscillation frequencies around the static equilibria such that they, have equal values in both scenarios. The harvester is then subjected to random base excitations of different levels, bandwidths, and center frequencies. The variance of the output voltage is measured across an arbitrary, purely resistive load and used for the purpose of performance comparison. Critical conclusions pertinent to the influence of the nonlinearity and relative performance in both configurations are presented and discussed.

This tool exposes the relations between the various types of design rules and end-of-life recovery parameters. Four different relationship types are developed in this research: recovery conditions and recovery options relationship, Design for Disassembly rules and recovery options relationship, Design for Disassembly rules and recovery conditions relationship, Design for Disassembly rules, and Design for Manufacturing and Design for Assembly rules relationship. The purpose of this research is to build these relations and transform these relationships into a database. The database serves as tool from which design rules can be retrieved by running queries. In addition to design rule retrieval, the tool also shows the relationships with various design rules, recovery options; and recovery conditions. This provides designers with information as to which rules are in conflict and which are complementary for the specific situation under consideration. To illustrate this tool, it is applied to motor-drive assembly and thermal gun sight, which are already design products. Additionally the application of the tool is demonstrated using a hypothetical scenario which involves products like coffee cup, cell phone and stapler.

An example is found in the first set of questions for estimating handling time of a part the user chose "parts are easy to grasp and manipulate" as opposed to "parts present handling difficulties". The subjectivity is explored through a study of assembly time estimates generated by a class of mechanical engineering students in the time analysis of a clicker pen based on the Boothroyd and Dewhurst estimation method. The assembly times calculated by the class ranged from a minimum of 23.64 seconds to a maximum of 44.89 seconds (range of 21.25 seconds). This large range in results serves as motivation in determining the effect that answering a subjective decision has on the resulting assembly time estimate. Initial results indicate that not answering the first level of subjective questions will result in assembly time estimate within 15% of the time had the subjective question been answered. The probability density plots of the time estimates also indicates that 63% of the time, the estimated assembly time without making the subjective decision will fall within the normal distribution had the subjective decision been made. This provides evidence that there is an opportunity to reduce the amount of subjective questions that a user must answer to estimate the assembly time of a product.

ASME					NEW INSIGHTS INTO PIEZOELECTRIC ENERGY HARVESTING USING A DYNAMIC MAGNIFIER								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME CONFERENCE ON SMART MATERIALS, ADAPTIVE STRUCTURES AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS, VOL 2								829	843					2012	2012	This manuscript considers the design and performance of a piezoelectric vibration-based energy harvester with a dynamic magnifier (VEHDM) to a traditional single degree-of-freedom harvester (VEHS) using proper metrics. Past research has shown that the addition of the second magnifying mass can increase the peak power harvested by as much as 20 times [1] when compared to the VEHS; however, the metrics of performance comparison were not clearly defined, nor was the comparison carried at optimal loading conditions. For instance, the peak power was compared at different excitation frequencies and power not power per unit mass is used for comparison purposes. Additionally, the VEHDM is designed so that the magnifier mass and stiffness are considered independent of the primary stiffness and mass of the harvester. In this study, we determine the optimal properties of the magnifier, in terms of frequency ratios and resistance that maximizes both power and power density for a fixed frequency harmonic excitation. The optimized VEHDM is compared to a similarly optimized VEHS. Treating the magnifier as a tuned mass damper (TMD), i.e., simply adding the magnifying mass and stiffness to the optimized VEHS and then tuning the magnifier to split the resonance peak of the single mass harvester, increases the peak power harvested for mass ratios greater than one. However, the peak frequencies of excitation of the VEHS and VEHDM differ. Only at large values of the mass ratio does the excitation frequency of the VEHS and VEDHM coincide, making the VEHDM less efficient in terms of power per unit mass. Similarly, simply adding a magnifying stiffness and mass to the optimized VEHS and then tuning both the VEDHM to the VEHS's to the same excitation frequency by changing the the uncoupled natural frequency of VEHDM's magnifier components limits the performance of the VEDHM. In this case, the VEHDM generates the same amount of power as the VEHS. Nonetheless, the VEHS is more efficient in terms of power generated per unit mass. In order to match the single mass harvester's power per unit mass, the optimal magnifier for the VEHDM is a rigid spring of negligible mass acting in series with the stiffness with the VEHDM's piezoceramic element. However, significant gains in both peak power and peak power per unit mass for a fixed frequency excitation can be obtained by considering all the mass and stiffness elements in the VEHDM, while using the same piezoelectric in the VEHS.

However, there are noticeable gaps in the literature with respect to understanding how the formulation of design problems and establishment of requirements affect the final design solution in undergraduate design education. This paper is an initial step to understand the influence of level of detail of problem statement and requirements on the level of detail of final solution in capstone design projects. In doing so, a document analysis of final reports from capstone design class collected over a period of ten years, 1999 to 2008, is conducted. A data compression approach is developed to allow for the mapping of level of detail of problem statement and requirements to the level of detail of final solution. The findings of this research indicate that a low level of detail problem statement and requirements leads to no greater than a medium level of detail in the final solution. A high level of detail of final solution is more likely to result from either a high or medium level of detail of problem statement and requirements. Additionally, it was found that a high level of detail final solution is more likely to result in a high percentage of requirements satisfied. These findings are used to make several recommendations to improve the level of detail of the problem statement and requirements so a high level of detail final solution is developed while satisfying a great number of requirements. This assists in ensuring that students possess the skills needed before entering the professional workforce.

We utilize a two-band k.p theory to calculate the variation of the electronic band structure as a function of externally applied strains. By using the modified electronic band structure, electrical conductivity of the Si/Ge nanocomposites is calculated through a self-consistent electron transport analysis, where a nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) is coupled with the Poisson equation. The results show that both the tensile uniaxial and biaxial strains increase the electrical conductivity of Si/Ge nanocomposite. The effects are more evident in the biaxial strain cases.

ASME					CROSS ANALYSIS OF METAL FOAM DESIGN PARAMETERS FOR ACHIEVING DESIRED FLUID FLOW								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL MECHANICAL ENGINEERING CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION, 2011, VOL 6, PTS A AND B								749	756					2012	2012	This paper presents an experimental study of air flow through open cell metal foams for use as a thermal energy dissipating system. The goal of this paper is to identify the optimum configuration of metal foam design parameters for maximum flow. Four foam blocks were used in the study, representing a range of design parameters: material (copper or aluminum), pore size (5-10 pores per inch), and relative density (epsilon = 0.875 - 0.952). The effects of pore size were isolated by comparing air flow through three aluminum foam blocks with constant density and varied pore size. A series of wind tunnel tests were performed to measure the velocity of air flowing through the foam as a function of the free stream air velocity, ranging from 0 to 17.4 mph (7.5 m/s). Results indicated smaller pore sizes and larger densities decreased the amount of airflow through the foam. However, one foam sample produced results that did not fit this trend. Further investigation found this was likely due to the differences in the cross-sectional geometry of the foam ligaments. The ligament geometry, affected by density and manufacturing method, was not constant and not initially considered as a variable of interest. The cross-section shape of the ligaments was found to vary from a rounded triangular shape to a triangle shape with concave surfaces, increasing the amount of drag in the airflow through the sample.

In order to reduce the rolling resistance, linear elastic materials are considered instead of elastomers. To achieve an adequate compliance level, a metamaterial needs to be designed. The required metamaterial properties are determined as a result of an optimization where the metamaterial tensor components as well as the geometric dimensions are the design variables. This way the metamaterial can be designed such that the overall behavior of the non pneumatic wheel achieves the best performance in terms of compliance and contact patch pressure distribution. The resulting constitutive metamaterial properties of the shear layer can be used as prescribed constitutive properties to tailor the periodic mesostructure of a material by means of topology optimization.

While the impact responses in terms of energy absorption and densification strains have been extensively researched and reported, a gap is identified in the generalization of honeycombs with controlled and varying geometric parameters. This paper attempts to address this gap through a series of finite element (FE) simulations where cell angle and angled wall thickness are varied while maintaining a constant mass of the honeycomb structure. A randomly filled, non-repeating Design of Experiments (DOE) is generated to determine the effects of these geometric parameters on the output of energy absorbed, and a statistical sensitivity analysis is used to determine the parameters significant for optimization. A high degree of variation in the impact response of varying cellular geometries has shown the potential for the forward design into lightweight crushing regions in many applications, particularly the automotive and aerospace industries. It is found that while an increase in angled wall thickness enhances the energy absorption of the structure, increases in either the cell angle or ratio of cell angle to angled wall thickness have adverse effects on the output. Finally, optimization results present that a positive angle cellular geometry with maximum angled wall thickness provides for maximum energy absorption, which is verified with a 6% error when compared to a final FE simulation.

In previous research, several metrics of complexity of graph-based product models have been proposed and suitably chosen combinations of these metrics have been shown to predict the time required in assembling commercial products. By extension, this research investigates if this approach, using new sets of combinations of complexity metrics, can predict market-value. To this end, the complexity values of function structures for eighteen products from the Design Repository are determined from their function structure graphs, while their market values are procured from different vendor quotes in the open market. The complexity and value information for fourteen samples are used to train a neural net program to define a predictive mapping scheme. This program is then used to predict the value of the final four products. The results of this approach demonstrate that complexity metrics can be used as inputs to neural networks to establish an accurate mapping from function structure design representations to market values to within the distribution of values for products of similar type.

ASME					A USER STUDY TO EVALUATE THE FUNCTION MODEL AND FUNCTION INTERACTION MODEL FOR CONCEPT GENERATION								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, 2011, VOL 9								273	284					2012	2012	Function modeling is often performed during the conceptual design phase to identify what the product must do in a solution independent form. However, function-based design approaches do not adequately enable designers to capture and analyze the non-functional requirements, interactions between the product of interest and other products and interactions between the product of interest and human users. This paper presents the results of a user study to evaluate how two models: (1) traditional function models (FM) and (2) the function interaction model (FIM), relate to functional and non-functional engineering requirements, and how they affect the creation of design solutions. Forty students were divided into two groups and asked to generate solutions for a design problem using either the function model (FM) or the function interaction model (FIM). The concepts were then evaluated in terms of quantity and quality by an external panel. Results from this study indicate that the quantity of solutions generated by the function model (FM) group is greater than the function interaction model (FIM) group. However, the quality of design concepts from the function interaction model (FIM) group is greater than the function model (FM) group. Further, non-functional requirements that are important to the design solutions cannot be captured in function model and thus are not reflected in the associated solution concepts.

The Boothroyd Dewhurst software requires the user to answer a set of questions about each part and how it is assembled to estimate an assembly time, assembly cost, and to suggest design improvements. The connective-complexity method predicts assembly times based on the physical connectivity between parts within an assembly. The methods are applied to three consumer products and evaluated and compared through five criteria: approximate time to conduct the analysis, predicted assembly time, amount of required input information, amount of subjective information, and number of redesign features provided to the user. The results show that the DFMA software requires the user to go through eight types of information answering a total of forty nine questions per part. Sixteen of these questions are based on subjective information making the analysis nearly a third subjective. The connectivity method requires only two types of information and a total of five questions per part to complete the analysis, none of it being subjective. The predicted assembly times from the connective-complexity DFA method ranged from 13.11% to 49.71% lower than the times predicted by the DFMA software. The results from this comparison can be used to bench mark DFA methods so that their weaknesses can be identified and improved.

A coupling index is also created to assess the level of coupling between interfaced features. A BMW X5 headliner assembly and a Ryobi hand-held drill are analyzed using the proposed method to identify the features and components that offer the greatest ease of change. The analysis of the BMW X5 headliner shows that the rectangular slots on the bottom of the adapter plates are the feature that offers the greatest ease of change, while the handles are the component that offers the greatest ease of change. For the Ryobi drill, the battery is identified as the component that offers the greatest ease of change. The proposed method of change prediction proves to be an effective and efficient means of modeling change propagation and assessing change impact.

To this end, tire saturation levels are defined as the deficiency of a tire to generate a force that linearly increases with the relevant slip quantities. These saturation levels are then used to set up an optimization objective for a torque distribution problem within a novel cascade control structure that exploits the natural time scale separation of the slower lateral handling dynamics of the vehicle from the relatively faster rotational dynamics of the wheel/tire.The envisaged application of the proposed vehicle stability strategy is for vehicles with advanced and emerging pure electric, hybrid electric or hydraulic hybrid power trains featuring independent wheel drives. The developed predictive control strategy is evaluated for, a two-axle truck featuring such an independent drive system and subjected to a transient handling maneuver.

ASME					CATEGORIZING AFFORDANCES FOR PRODUCT DESIGN								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, VOL 7								325	+					2012	2012	To compensate for the inability of the functional descriptions to describe for instance interactions between users and artifacts, the term affordance has been introduced in design methodology by Maier and Fadel. However, some significant details of affordance such as representation, categorization, and application to mechanical design still need to be further studied. Therefore, this paper reviews and compares the use of the term affordance in the fields of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Artificial Intelligence (AI), design, psychology, and philosophy. Based on that review, a new categorization scheme of affordances applicable for product design is proposed. The categories including doing and happening Artifact-Artifact Affordances (dAAA and hAAA), doing and happening Artifact-Environment Affordances (dAEA and hAEA), and doing and happening Artifact-User Affordances (dAUA and hAUA) are identified and an initial statistical evaluation is performed to support this proposal. The detailed description of these affordances provides better coverage, more orthogonality, more depth, and could be more usable, eventually meeting the requirements of a taxonomy.

Nine electromechanical consumer products were chosen and evaluated based on function and form. The results of the experiment show that the products demonstrate a significant variability in physical complexity according to design for manufacturing principles for similar if not identical functional complexity. These results demonstrate that function alone is not an adequate way to evaluate the difficulty of realizing a given concept. Performance characteristics of the functional concept must also be considered. The paper concludes with suggestions for future work in order to better understand how performance influences the physical complexity of an artifact.

Function models have been proposed by many researchers as a tool to expand the solution search space and guide concept generation, and many design tools have been created to support function-based design. These tools require designers to create function models of new or existing artifacts, but there is limited published research describing the level of functional detail that should be included in a model or the appropriate level of abstraction to model artifacts. Further, there is limited experimental evidence that designers use function models when generating concepts, and controlled experiments in the literature have focused on ideation rather than function models. Therefore, this research focuses on how artifacts should be modeled to guide concept generation in conceptual design.In this research, three artifact representations are studied: function models, interaction models, and pruned function models. A user study was conducted in which participants were asked to design a new device based on a problem statement, a set of requirements, and a treatment. Participants were randomly assigned a treatment of a function model, interaction model, pruned model, or no model. A conformance metric was developed to measure the extent to which participants used a model when generating concept sketches. The results show that the functional conformance of participants using a pruned model is approximately 40% higher than that of participants using a function model. These results demonstrate that the use of a specific level of functional detail improves the use of functions within the model for concept generation.

Numerous different metrics, such as quantity, sketch quality, and solution quality, are used by the researchers to analyze sketches. This paper presents a survey of the metrics used in the design research community. Characteristics developed by the authors to evaluate these metrics are used to compare the metrics. Further, an initial attempt to identify a relation between type of research approach and characteristics of the metrics is then reported to test the hypothesis that a mature research field would include canonically accepted metrics for experimental studies. The findings indicate that current literature does not provide any formal definition of metrics that are widely accepted in the community. The findings from correlations indicate a general trend of using objective metrics for qualitative research and subjective metrics for mixed method approach. Ultimately, this work lays the foundation for a more systematic approach to evaluating engineering design sketches through critical selection of metrics.

ASME					MODELING MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF MATERIALS PROCESSED BY ACCUMULATIVE ROLL BONDING								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, 2012								77	86					2012	2012	Nanostructured materials are a relatively new class of materials that exhibit high strength and toughness, thus improving performance and capabilities of products, with potential applications to automotive, aerospace and defense industries. Among the severe plastic deformation (SPD) methods currently used for achieving nanoscale structure of a material, accumulative roll bonding (ARB) is the most favorable method to produce grain refinement for continuous production of "metallic sheets at a bulk scale. ARB is a deformation technique where metallic sheets are repeatedly prepared, stacked and rolled together, usually to a reduction of 50% in thickness.The main objective of this paper is to create a model that relates the process parameters and number of ARB cycles to the mechanical properties of the resultant material. The model established in this study can be a useful tool in designing the process and establishing the number of cycles needed in order to achieve the desired properties. Accumulative roll bonding experiments of various materials are analyzed and the resultant materials strength, at the corresponding ARB. cycles, is modeled with good agreement.

Recent research by the authors has led to ways of accounting for the formability increases due to the applied electricity, by way of an Electroplastic Effect Coefficient (EEC), and by utilizing this coefficient, simple EAM forming tests can ultimately be modeled.This work provides insight into the authors' EAM modeling methodology and how it differs from previous EAM modeling attempts. Additionally, from the Electrically-Assisted Forming (EAF) experiments, two methods of accounting for. the electroplastic effect will be discussed and compared. Ultimately, these methods will be integrated into the thermo-mechanical model to predict compressive stress-strain profiles for electrically-assisted forming tests under various current densities and die speeds.

The modeling and analysis strategy accounts for both mechanical effects and heat transfer effects due to the applied electrical power.This work presents a sensitivity analysis and explanation of several key material and process inputs during an Electrically-Assisted Forming (EAF) test on Stainless Steel 304 and Titanium Grades 2 and 5 specimens. First, the effect that the specific heat (C-p) value has on the model will be discussed and compared with another lightweight material. Second, the significance of all three heat transfer modes (conduction, convection; and radiation) will be noted, and any possible simplifications to the existing heat transfer model will be highlighted. Third, the general electroplastic effect coefficient (EEC) profile shape for the Stainless Steel 304 material will be compared to that of Titanium alloys. Fourth, a frequency analysis will be done on the data taken during the experiments, by way of a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and the variation of frequency response with the electric input is studied.Overall, this work provides insight into several factors affecting a material's EEC profile, and also compares resulting EEC profiles of various materials.

With this concept, the rotating stirring tool is plunged into the material, rather than being traversed across it as in FSP; this imposes severe plastic deformation on the material while pushing it radially outwards in complex spiral paths. By confining the material within a closed cylindrical die, the processed material is microstructurally-refined while forming a tube via a special form of SFSP called "friction stir back extrusion" (FSBE). The hypothesised concept was investigated using samples from the AA6063-T52 aluminium alloy and the AZ31B-F magnesium alloy. The preliminary results presented here demonstrate the viability of SFSP, and the special form of FSBE, in producing tubular samples that are structurally sound, with no signs of voids or internal channels. Optical microscopy was performed at key locations within selected tube specimens, and the obtained micrographs clearly show the presence of a stir zone with a fine grain structure; grain size measurements demonstrate the "effectiveness of the processing technique in refining the microstructure of the starting material.

A previously developed methodology for assessing the worn tool material volume is utilized for quantifying the VTW of carbide tools when machining Ti-6Al-4V. To capture the tool substrate response, controlled milling experiments are conducted at suitable corner points of the feed-speed design space for constant stock material removal volumes. For each case, the tool material volumes worn away, as well as the corresponding volumetric wear profile evolution in terms of a set of geometric coefficients are quantified - these are then related to the MRR. Further, the volumetric wear rate and the M-ratio (volume of stock removed to VTW), which is a measure of the cutting tool efficiency, are related to the MRR - these provide a tool-centered optimal MRR in terms of profitability. This work not only elevates tool wear from a 1-D to 3-D concept, but helps in assessing machining economics from a stock material removal efficiency perspective as well.

Line balancing is made even more complex due to the high level of option content in premium automobiles. The current phase of this study involves hands-on training on the automotive assembly line, precedence relationship mapping of all the tasks involved on a pilot assembly line, identification of constraints, and development of a strategy to manage option content and constraints. The second phase will include the generation of an optimal line balance through optimization on expected station utilization. The current line balancing process relies significantly on the experience level of the utility workers and team leaders. Although initially labor intensive, the precedence mapping exercise and option coding strategy will facilitate the development of a decision support system to aid the human decision-maker in making data-driven decisions about work distribution.

Cutting force in machining process is an interesting variable to measure from monitoring and control point of view. Although the direct methods of measuring the cutting force exist, prohibitive costs do not allow deployment in industrial environment. In the indirect methods of measuring force, measuring the spindle motor current to estimate the cutting power and consequently the cutting force is popular.This work discusses the calibration of spindle current based torque sensor for the estimation of the cutting force in turning operation. The work undertakes handling uncertainty in measurement of the cutting torque measurement. Considering the steady state value, the cutting torque is represented as a polynomial function of the speed and measured power. Though the identification of the unknown coefficients can be done based on the offline tests, in current work, the Bayesian :update of coefficients is proposed. This method allows online learning of these coefficients. The cutting torque value based on the model has some variability due to variation in the coefficients and unmodeled dynamics. The iterative learning happens in three stages, namely- Prior belief, likelihood function establishment and update in prior belief with observed data producing posterior belief. The establishment of the priors is done through some offline tests. The likelihood function accounts for noise in the measurement of torque. And finally, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations help sampling from unknown posterior distribution. This scheme has ability to sample from any distribution. A single update cycle shows high reduction in the variability of the torque. Experimental data is produced to verify the effectiveness of method; the Bayesian update scheme outperforms least-square polynomial fit method consistently for different cutting speeds and cutting load values.

Syvertsen, JP		Mechanical Blossom Thinning in South Carolina Peach Orchards								I INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MECHANICAL HARVESTING AND HANDLING SYSTEMS OF FRUITS AND NUTS		Acta Horticulturae		965				117	121					2012	2012	Blossom and/or green fruit thinning is the most labor intensive and costly operation in the production of southeastern peaches. Efforts to utilize caustic chemicals or hormones to reduce fruit set have been largely unsuccessful. Past ineffective efforts at mechanical flower thinning involved ropes, pressurized water or air. Recently, mechanization developed for apples in Europe was adapted to peaches in the United States. This technology (i.e., the Darwin 250 string thinner) was evaluated for 3 years in South Carolina grower orchards trained as either open center, quad-V or perpendicular-V systems. Treatments varied each year with the primary ones being two sections of cords (i.e., strings) opposite each other with either 9 or 18 cords per section. Tractor speeds were 2.9-4.0 km/h with spindle speeds from 180 to 230 rpm. Passes per tree were either two (horizontally over the top down one side and back the other) or four (horizontally over the top and angled on the side on both sides of the tree). All treatments were followed by green fruit removal with labor costs calculated from crew timesheets. Past research suggested a goal of 45-50% flower removal. The Darwin worked best in V and quad-V systems. Open center trees were less uniformly thinned. Darwin treatments advanced fruit maturity and significantly increased the number of larger fruit. However, yields were not always better than the controls, and crop values varied among cultivars and years. In 2011, Darwin treatments cost $143 to $1215/ha less than standard green fruit thinning, but associated gross revenue ranged from an 8.3% decrease to an 8.1% increase. The Darwin was not as uniform in thinning compared to hand removal, but labor savings with increased fruit size were obtained. The scaffold orientation in open center systems must be uniformly trained to be thinned evenly by the Darwin and to reduce over-thinning in the upper canopy.					1st International Symposium on Mechanical Harvesting and Handling Systems of Fruits and Nuts1st International Symposium on Mechanical Harvesting and Handling Systems of Fruits and Nuts	APR 02-04, 2012APR 02-04, 2012	Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)	Lake Alfred, FLLake Alfred, FL	2	0	0	2	0	2			0567-7572		978-90-66056-35-0	WOS:000323830200014

Quantifying the Role of Viewing the Denali 'Big 5' in Visitor Satisfaction and Awareness: Conservation Implications for Flagship Recognition and Resource Management.								Human Dimensions of Wildlife				17	2			112	128					2012	2012	Wildlife viewing is a primary attraction at Denali National Park (DNP), with most visitors wishing to observe the "Big 5": grizzly bear (Ursus arctos), wolf (Canis lupus), caribou (Rangifer tarandus), Dall sheep (Ovis dalli dalli), and moose (Alces alces gigas). This study explored the role of individual "Big 5" species on (a) visitors' wildlife viewing satisfaction, (b) overall trip satisfaction, and (c) awareness of fundamental purposes for establishing DNP (i.e., enabling legislation). Data were obtained from 582 DNP visitor surveys during 2007. Grizzly observations yielded significantly higher levels of wildlife viewing satisfaction than all other species except caribou. No significant difference was found between species for overall trip satisfaction. Awareness of enabling legislation improved with higher levels of satisfaction and number of species observed. Grizzly bear and caribou are recommended as flagship species. This could increase viewing opportunities and visitor satisfaction within an experienced-based management framework.									4	0	0	3	0	4			1087-1209			ZOOREC:ZOOR14910043546

Batsch] mutant evergrowing, which fails to cease growth and enter dormancy under dormancy-inducing conditions. One or more of these peach DAM genes have been proposed as candidates for the regulation of growth cessation and terminal bud formation. The proximity or co-localization of peach EVG locus with a QTL associated with a chilling requirement trait suggests that the DAM genes are also potential candidate genes for this characteristic. Two peach DAM genes (DAM5 and 6) are up-regulated by short days and peak at winter solstice, coincident with the chilling accumulation achievement required for bud break. Reports on homologous of the DAM genes from other species also indicate that these genes could be cold regulated. In this work, we used three cultivars with different chilling requirement to correlate the fulfillment of chilling requirement with the expression of the peach DAM genes. Vegetative terminal and floral buds were sampled from field grown 'Contender' (1050 chilling hours), 'Rubyprince' (850 chilling hours) and 'Springprince' (650 chilling hours) peach cultivars, weekly through winter 2008-2009. Flower bud break potential was evaluated weekly by transferring cuttings to a growth-permissive environment, and bud-burst was scored after 14 days. We used quantitative real time PCR to study the expression of the DAM genes during chilling accumulation. We also evaluated vegetative bud break and DAM genes expression in Contender under controlled cold exposure. The potential role of the DAM genes in the chilling requirement of peach will be discussed. The material collected will be used for the development of an EST library of bud tissue during chilling accumulation.					7th International Peach Symposium7th International Peach Symposium	JUN 08-11, 2009JUN 08-11, 2009	Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)	Lleida, SPAINLleida, SPAIN	1	0	0	1	0	1			0567-7572		978-90-66056-15-2	WOS:000323610100024

Batsch] Rootstock Seedling Identification by DNA-Fingerprinting with Microsatellite (SSR) Markers								VII INTERNATIONAL PEACH SYMPOSIUM		Acta Horticulturae		962				169	175					2012	2012	Peach rootstocks are usually propagated from seeds. Seedlings are difficult to distinguish morphologically, and once grafted, no above ground material is available for visual identification. To avoid misidentification and to protect plant cultivars and patents, DNA fingerprinting was investigated as a robust rootstock identification tool. The objective was to identify peach seedling rootstocks of Bailey, Guardian (R) 'BY520-9' selection 3-17-7, Halford, Kakamas, Lovell, Nemaguard, Nemared and S-37. Twenty-eight SSR markers were screened on the eight rootstocks, and 23 exhibited polymorphism. Ten SSR markers were found to amplify at least four patterns among the eight rootstocks. Each rootstock clone could be discriminated by as few as a single SSR marker (e. g., Lovell) or at most, nine markers (e. g., S-37). No single perfect marker was found that could differentiate all rootstocks from each other. Marker BPPCT008 had the highest identification potential because it amplified seven patterns and was capable of uniquely distinguishing six of the eight rootstocks directly. Seedling identification was conducted by screening seedlings of open-pollinated rootstock clones. It was more difficult than parent genotype identification because a heterozygous pattern for a rootstock clone segregated in its seedlings. However, unique segregated patterns were found in the rootstock seedlings. Seedlings of several rootstocks such as Bailey, Kakamas, Nemaguard and Nemared could be identified by single SSR markers. Seedlings of 3-17-7 and S-37 could be identified by marker combinations. Seedlings of Lovell and Halford were differentiated from the other rootstocks by single markers. However, there were no SSRs or marker combinations to differentiate Lovell seedlings from Halford seedlings. The SSR markers presented in this study could be used as a practical fingerprinting system for rootstock seedling identification. This technology will be useful to test rootstocks for trueness to type for nurseries and commercial peach growers, and also will be helpful in protecting seed propagated proprietary rights (i.e., PVP) for fruit tree breeders.					7th International Peach Symposium7th International Peach Symposium	JUN 08-11, 2009JUN 08-11, 2009	Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)	Lleida, SPAINLleida, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-90-66056-15-2	WOS:000323610100025

Studies indicate that picture-book reading within a facilitated story-time setting is an important tool for language acquisition in children. We hypothesize that in an increasingly digital society, literacy can be cultivated in a robot-embedded environment that is, at once, physical, digital and evocative of the picture-book being read. Inspired by concepts of embodied interaction, our developing LIT ROOM is an intelligent, fine-tunable suite of architectural-robotic artifacts distributed at room-scale in a public library setting. Presented here are motivations for and design overview of this developing interactive artifact.

B	Bode, R. Donovan; Daqaq, Mohammed F.			ASME					PARAMETRIC AMPLIFICATION IN THE CONTEXT OF VIBRATORY ENERGY HARVESTING								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME CONFERENCE ON SMART MATERIALS, ADAPTIVE STRUCTURES AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS (SMASIS 2011), VOL 2								189	198					2012	2012	In this manuscript, we propose a technique to harvest energy from excitation sources that possess two frequency components: a fundamental component with large energy content, and a super-harmonic component with smaller energy content at twice the fundamental component. Excitations of this nature are common in the environment due to inherent nonlinearities in the dynamics of the excitation source. Normally, two separate energy harvesters are needed to extract the energy at each frequency; however, this paper discusses a single cantilevered piezoelectric vibratory energy harvester (VEH) that exploits the parametric amplification phenomenon to scavenge energy from both frequencies by varying the tilt angle between the axis of the harvester and the direction of the excitation. To investigate the efficacy of the proposed concept, the equations governing the electromechanical dynamics of the harvester are derived. The resulting partial differential equations and associated boundary conditions are then reduced to a single-mode Galerkin based reduced-order model. Analytical expressions for the steady-state output power across a purely resistive load are obtained using the method of multiple scales. Results indicate that percentage improvement in the output power depends on the excitation's parameters, the tilt angle, and the mechanical damping ratio. It is observed that there is an optimal tilt angle at which the flow of energy from the environment to the electric load is maximized. Furthermore, when the mechanical damping ratio is small, significant enhancement in the output power is attainable even when the magnitude of the super-harmonic is very small when compared to the fundamental component. Such findings reveal that, under certain conditions, parametric amplification can be utilized to enhance the output power of a VEH especially for micro-scale applications where the damping ratio can be easily controlled. Experimental results are presented to validate the theoretical concepts.					4th Annual Meeting of the ASME/AIAA Smart Materials, Adaptive Structures and Intelligent Systems (SMASIS)4th Annual Meeting of the ASME/AIAA Smart Materials, Adaptive Structures and Intelligent Systems (SMASIS)	SEP 18-21, 2011SEP 18-21, 2011	ASME; AIAAASME; AIAA	Scottsdale, AZScottsdale, AZ	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-5472-3	WOS:000322090300024

This paper proposes an adaptive cruise control system that acts more smoothly and fuel efficiently by utilizing probabilistic information of velocity transition of the front car. The car following problem is formulated in a chance constrained model predictive control framework in which the inter-vehicle gap constraints are enforced probabilistically. The probability distribution of the position of the front car is estimated through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. The position probability distribution is then utilized to convert the chance constrained MPC problem to a deterministic linear MPC problem. Two case studies with two real driving cycle profiles are presented to show the potential improvement in fuel economy.

IEEE					A New Robust Nonlinear Control Algorithm for the Regulation of Blood Glucose in Diabetic Patients								2012 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONTROL APPLICATIONS (CCA)		IEEE International Conference on Control Applications						1057	1061					2012	2012	Diabetes mellitus is a growing health problem worldwide. Especially, the patients with Type 1 diabetes need strict glycemic control because they have deficiency of insulin production. Today, the aim of the researchers is to develop a fully automated closed loop control system (i.e., artificial pancreas which is capable of continuous glucose sensing and regulating) that replicates the function of pancreatic beta cells. This equipment is supposed to be capable of maintaining normal blood glucose level on a desired level (4-6.2 mmol/L) and taking all factors affecting glucose concentration into account without inducing hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.In this paper, control of the Bergman minimal mathematical model to regulate blood glucose level is discussed. The control problem is complicated by the fact that the model is considered to be uncertain. Furthermore, only the glucose level is assumed to be available for control development and other states such as insulin concentration and plasma insulin concentration are assumed to be unavailable for measurement. A novel robust controller is proposed that guarantees practical tracking of a desired glucose concentration.

The heterogeneous wireless system is composed of several Radio Access Technologies (RATs) available at consumer premises. The smart devices that use Smart Grid applications are assumed to have reconfigurable radios. A centralized Global Resource Controller (GRC) instructs the smart devices to use a particular RAT at any given time. The device-to-RAT association is made by the GRC using a two-step scheduling algorithm that accounts for the requirements of both best-effort and real-time Smart Grid traffic. To make the solution scalable, the approach utilizes Dynamic Spectrum Access methods to obtain additional open spectrum. We show up to 80% increase in real-time traffic support and 726% increase in best-effort traffic support in our proposed heterogeneous wireless system that uses reconfigurable radios, compared to the homogeneous wireless networks used today by smart devices with static radios.

IEEE					Adaptive-Rate Channel Coding for Packet Radio Systems with Higher Layer Fountain Coding								2012 IEEE MILITARY COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE (MILCOM 2012)		IEEE Military Communications Conference												2012	2012	We present and evaluate two low-complexity protocols for adaptive transmission in tactical packet radio systems that employ higher layer fountain codes. The adaptive-rate coding protocol is permitted to adjust the rate of the channel code between each pair of consecutive packets. The adaptive modulation and coding protocol can change the modulation between each pair of consecutive packets, but it can adjust the code rate only between consecutive frames of packets. Each protocol responds to dynamic fading and other time-varying propagation losses. For control of the adaptation, the protocols rely solely on a simple statistic derived by the receiver. They require no channel measurements, parameter estimates, pilot symbols, or training. The throughput performance of each protocol is evaluated for a Rayleigh fading channel modeled by a finite-state Markov chain. We show that our adaptive-rate coding protocol in tandem with higher layer fountain coding outperforms fountain coding with fixed-rate channel coding. We also compare the performance of our adaptive-rate coding protocol with the performance of a hypothetical ideal adaptive-rate coding protocol for which the transmitter is given perfect channel state information for the previous packet. We demonstrate that our protocol performs nearly as well as the ideal protocol.

It is shown that the use of per-dwell soft-output detection in conjunction with successive-erasures decoding results in better performance in the presence of partial-band interference than previously considered iterative decoding techniques for the same packet format. Several alternatives are considered for soft-output symbol detection and the estimator of the per-dwell signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio.

Here, we review current theoretical models that have been useful at shedding light on experimental findings but also provide predictive capabilities that are needed to achieve the optimization of supercapacitors. Due to the non-planar surface of materials at the nanoscale, the original Helmholtz model is gradually found to be outdated, in particular for carbon materials. We show that the surface Curvature-based models provide a better description of the interfacial behavior of carbon materials.

The formulation couples a velocity-pressure system with a vorticity-helicity system, and is intended to provide a numerical scheme with enhanced accuracy and superior conservation properties. For a few benchmark problems, we study the performance of a finite element method for this formulation and compare it with the commonly used velocity-pressure based finite element method. It is shown that both steady and unsteady discrete problems in the new formulation admit simple decoupiing strategies followed by the application of iterative solves to auxiliary subproblems. Further, we compare several iterative strategies to solve the discrete problems and study the interplay between the choice of stabilization parameters in the finite element method and the efficiency of linear algebra solvers.

Prevalence, Control Strategies, and Challenges Facing Urban Pest Management Professionals in South Carolina								Journal of Agricultural and Urban Entomology				28	1			16	24		10.3954/1523-5475-28.1.16			JAN 2012	2012	Bed bug infestations have been recorded in all 50 states of the United States and they were listed as the number one urban pest problem in 2010 by urban pest management professionals. The objective of this research was to survey urban pest management professionals of South Carolina about the importance and prevalence of bed bugs, types of infested dwellings, most common treatment strategies, and most common problems encountered when treating for bed bugs. Survey forms were distributed at the South Carolina Pest Control Association's annual meeting in 2011. Data were separated according to regions of South Carolina (upstate, midlands, and low country) for analysis. Ants and cockroaches ranked as the two most important pests in all regions, while bed bugs consistently ranked fifth in importance. Houses and apartments were reported to have the most infestations, and insecticides and mechanical removal were the most common treatment strategies. This information is beneficial to state agencies, pest control companies, and extension specialists in South Carolina who are repeatedly called for advice about bed bugs and their infestations.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1523-5475	2153-652X		BCI:BCI201300466926

Serious concern over the benefit of tourism for the poor has contributed to discussion on community involvement and community participation in contemporary literature. In particular, sustainable development has become a way to address the long-term viability of income and employment in least-developed countries while attempting to preserve traditional customs and culture in the face of globalization. Sustainability refers to finding solutions to poverty without compromising the natural and cultural resource base needed by future generations to pursue their own economic goals. This task requires attention to the economic, cultural and social needs of all groups while focusing on solutions that are also viable for the long term (Bramwell, 2001; Davidson, 2007; Mfaume & Leonard, 2004). It is also important to note that social structures and cultural references vary noticeably within countries and regions. Therefore, three separate, independent instrumental case studies (also known as collective case studies) were conducted in three distinct Tanzanian communities in or around tourism destinations. The objective was to allow for the autonomy of specific cultural, social and business networks to be reflected in the research methodology.Case studies allow for the investigation of constraints to economic participation within real-life experiences, as there is no clear distinction between the phenomenon and the context. Instrumental case studies strive to develop theory, or in this case, facilitate understanding of pervasive problems and do not require typical study populations (Stake, 1995). An instrumental case study is utilized where a 'particular case is examined mainly to provide insight' into a phenomenon and the case supports understanding of the phenomenon (Denzin & Lincoln, 2005). The emphasis is placed on specific issues rather than on the case itself. The case in then used as a vehicle to develop a better understanding of the situation or problem (Stake, 2003). Single case studies are ideal for investigating a phenomenon that has not been previously studied and can make a significant contribution to knowledge (Yin, 2003). Since constraints to economic participation within Tanzania have not yet been empirically studied, each individual case study is exploratory in nature.Once the specific case studies were independently derived and themes developed, a cross-case comparison offered insight into reoccurring themes or case-specific constraints. Using an iterative process, the strength of this methodology lies in the inductive approach that provides suggestive rather than definitive analysis (Welch, 1994). The first phase of analysis results in 'within' themes specific to a particular region. Using cross-case comparisons, emergent patterns provide similarities and differences between the three communities.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1871-3173		978-1-78052-742-0	WOS:000319745500030

ASME					ASSESSMENT OF QUANTITATIVE METHODOLOGY FOR EVALUATION OF RETRIEVED METALLIC FEMORAL COMPONENTS FROM TOTAL KNEE REPLACEMENTS								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME/STLE INTERNATIONAL JOINT TRIBOLOGY CONFERENCE - 2011								39	41					2012	2012	The metallic surfaces of total joint replacement components are subject to surface damage and roughening that can severely limit the service lifetime of the bearing system. To date, there are no standards by which to characterize the severity and modes of this critical surface damage, and therefore it remains difficult to accurately assess how femoral damage influences total joint replacement longevity. This study introduces a novel femoral component damage scoring methodology that combines a semi-quantitative visual damage scoring assessment and a fully quantitative non-contact characterization of the articular surface profile. The femoral surface was divided into 6 pre-determined zones, with 5 possible modes of damage and 4 (0-3) levels of damage severity, to produce a maximum possible damage score of 90. The 5 modes of metallic surface damage were; number of scratches, scratch depth, third body wear, abrasion and pitting. Three independent examiners were trained and then evaluated 33 retrieved TKRs systems (n=11 Oxinium and n=23 CoCr) with in-situ times of 3.6 +/- 4.2 yrs (range of 0.1 - 20 yrs). The average damage score was 19.9 +/- 30.8 with an inter-observer variability of only 1.5%. Articular damage mode frequency was calculated and found to be 61% for scratching, 15% for pitting and 52% for abrasion. The quantitative characterization of the articular surface profile of the femoral component using non-contact profilometry (n=150/retrieved component) illustrated a positive correlation between damage score and the average surface roughness for implants with an Ra greater than 65 nm (R (2) of 0.865). This methodology identified a critical Ra threshold above the standard manufacturing tolerance (similar to 50nm) wherein visual damage scoring was predictive of increases in quantitative surface roughness. This study validates the use of this novel methodology across most TKR material pairings. Future work will correlate damage scores and measured surface roughness with patient demographic and functional information.

J	Alluri, Priyanka; Ogle, Jennifer								Road Safety Analysis in the United States States' Current Practices and Their Future Direction								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD					2318			7	15		10.3141/2318-02			2012	2012	The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users required each of the states to develop a strategic highway safety plan and establish a Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) as a core program. The HSIP required states to submit annual 5% reports describing at least 5% of their most hazardous locations, approaches being used to improve safety at these locations, and their effectiveness in improving safety. A review of FHWA's 2009 5% reports indicated that most state departments of transportation were still using basic safety analysis procedures such as frequency, rate, or safety index. Understanding that traditional methods are fraught with issues, biases, and false assumptions, recent research has opened doors to more advanced methodologies in the form of two safety analysis tools: SafetyAnalyst and the Highway Safety Manual (HSM). Unlike basic traditional methods, the empirical Bayes approach used in these tools involves rigorous calculations and requires safety performance functions in addition to roadway characteristics, traffic volume, and crash information. The data requirements and statistical complexity of these new safety tools are considered by many a hindrance to their adoption, but the levels of increasing complexity with additional requirements allow states to adopt at their own speed. The intent of this paper is to document the current engineering-related safety analysis practices and states' perspectives toward adopting and implementing SafetyAnalyst and the HSM. The perspectives of several states on implementation of SafetyAnalyst were obtained through a survey and are discussed in this paper. This survey mainly helps the practitioners, administrators, and researchers to understand the various engineering-related safety analysis methods used across states and the states' perceptions on shifting to newer tools.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0361-1981			WOS:000320207700003

Specifically, we investigate the decision process and the paths to commercialize academic technologies. University-based technology transfer involves multiple stakeholders with competing interests; hence, we believe researchers should apply a multilevel theoretical lens, which starts with the disclosure of discoveries made by scientists in their labs. We build a multilevel framework that views the scientists' choice to first disclose viable discoveries to pursue entrepreneurial action as a function of three factors: (i) a scientist's rent orientation, (ii) a university's rent doctrine, and (iii) the rent doctrine of the scientific field in which the scientist conducts research. We suggest that commercial disclosure most often occurs when there is alignment between these three factors. Lastly, we advance an agenda for future empirical research by developing specific propositions about the key constructs and relationships concerning university-based entrepreneurial action.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1074-7540		978-1-78052-900-4	WOS:000319662600004		
J	Degenhardt, David C.; Greene, Jeremy K.								Influence of Pyrethroid Pesticide Formulation on Volatile Emissions from Cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L., Leaves								Journal of Agricultural and Urban Entomology				28	1			8	15		10.3954/1523-5475-28.1.8			JAN 2012	2012	Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are known to influence numerous ecological interactions among plants, insects, and natural enemies. There is little information on the direct or indirect effects of insecticide application on the production and emission of VOCs from plants. The goal of this study was to investigate the influence of two pyrethroid formulations on the emission of VOCs from cotton (Gossypium hirisutum L.). Emissions were sampled from cotton leaves treated with either a capsule suspension (CS) or an emulsifiable concentrate (EC) of lambda-cyhalothrin, or untreated controls 24 and 96 h after application of insecticides and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Results indicated that application of either formulation of pyrethroid had no significant effect on the total emission of volatiles during any sampling period. Interestingly, untreated plants did exhibit significantly greater emissions of (E)-2-hexenal, beta-farnesene, and (E, E)-4,8,12-trimethyl-1,3,7,11-tridecatetrae compared with plants treated with CS or EC formulations, seemingly due to significantly greater herbivore feeding activity on control plants compared with insecticide treated plants. The results of this study provide no indication that insecticide treatment influences VOC emission from plants; however, more controlled laboratory studies would likely provide more conclusive evidence.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1523-5475	2153-652X		BCI:BCI201300466925

Given the process specification limits and associated rework or rejection costs, the traditional method for identifying the optimal process mean involves assuming values for each of the process distribution parameters prior to implementing an optimization scheme. In contrast, this article proposes integrating response surface methods into the framework of the problem, thus removing the need to make assumptions on the parameters. Furthermore, whereas researchers have studied models to investigate this research problem for a single quality characteristic and multiple nominal-the-best type characteristics, this article specifically examines the mixed multiple quality characteristic problem. A non-linear programming routine with economic considerations is established to facilitate the identification of the optimal process mean vector. An analysis of the sensitivity corresponding to the cost structure, tolerance, and quality loss settings is also provided to illustrate their effect on the solutions.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0740-817X			WOS:000308129500007

Genetic variability of Rotylenchulus reniformis. Plant Dis. 96:30-36.Rotylenchulus reniformis, reniform nematode, is a polyphagous pest commonly found parasitizing cotton in the southeastern United States. We developed and optimized 10 polymorphic microsatellite loci found in reniform nematode and tested them on 160 individual reniform nematodes to determine informative genetic variation of isolates from the southeastern United States, Colombia, Japan, and from the species Rotylenchulus parvus. No significant gametic disequilibrium was detected between any pair of loci, and most loci were not in expected Hardy-Weinberg proportions. A positive F-IS coefficient was observed at all 10 loci, suggesting a high level of inbreeding at these loci. Most isolate locations exhibited significant genotypic differentiation and moderate to very high genetic differentiation based on F-ST analysis. The most consistently differentiated isolates were found reproducing parthenogenetically in Japan. These isolates were also found to represent the most basal locality in this study based on unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) clustering analysis and were distinct from other localities based on STRUCTURE V 2.3 analysis. These results support previous reports suggesting that the parthenogenetically reproducing isolates from Japan are another species. Taken together, our results can serve as the foundation for more extensive characterization of population structure and genetic variation among isolates of R. reniformis variants to help discern the impact of alternative processes on genetic connectivity and differentiation in the genetically undercharacterized reniform nematode.									9	0	0	8	0	9			0191-2917	1943-7692		WOS:000298264500004		
S	Chen, Kang; Shen, Haiying			IEEE					SMART: Lightweight Distributed Social Map Based Routing in Delay Tolerant Networks								2012 20TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NETWORK PROTOCOLS (ICNP)		IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols Proceedings												2012	2012	Previous Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) routing algorithms exploit either past encounter records (probabilistic routing) or social network properties (social network based routing) to derive a node's probability of delivering packets to their destinations. However, they only have a local view of the network, which limits the routing efficiency. Also, when two nodes meet, they have to exchange the delivery probabilities to the destinations of all packets in the two nodes, which incurs high resource consumption. In a social network, the people a person frequently meets are usually stable, which makes them play a more important role in forwarding message for the person. Based on this, we propose a lightweight distributed Social MAp based Routing algorithm in delay Tolerant networks (SMART). In SMART, each node builds its own social map consisting of nodes it has met and their frequently encountered nodes in a distributed manner. Based on both encountering frequency and social closeness of the two linked nodes in the social map, we decide the weight of each link to reflect the packet delivery probability between the two nodes. The social map enables more accurate forwarder selection through a broader view. Moreover, nodes exchange much less information for social map update and need fewer updates due to social map stability, which reduces resource consumption. Trace-driven experiments and tests on the GENI ORBIT testbed demonstrate the high efficiency of SMART in comparison with previous algorithms.					20th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP)20th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP)	OCT 30-NOV 02, 2012OCT 30-NOV 02, 2012	IEEEIEEE	Austin, TXAustin, TX	0	0	0	0	0	0			1092-1648		978-1-4673-2447-2	WOS:000318647500046

Retrieving files efficiently and trustworthily in such a large and jumbled system is critically important. However, the issues of efficient searching and trustworthy searching have only been studied separately. Simply combining two separate strategies dealing with each issue doubles system overhead. In this paper, we first study trace data from Facebook and BitTorrent. Guided by the study observations, we propose a P2P system based on social networks for simultaneous efficient and trustworthy file sharing, namely Social-P2P. Social-P2P groups common-multi-interest nodes into a cluster and further connects socially close nodes within a cluster. The comparably stable nodes in each cluster form a DHT for inter-cluster file searching. A file query is forwarded to the cluster of the file by the DHT routing and then is forwarded along constructed connections within a cluster, which achieves high hit rate and reliable routing. Sharing files among socially close friends discourages nodes from providing faulty files since people are unlikely to risk their reputation in the real world. Experimental results show that by leveraging a social network, Social-P2P achieves highly efficient and trustworthy file sharing.					20th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP)20th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP)	OCT 30-NOV 02, 2012OCT 30-NOV 02, 2012	IEEEIEEE	Austin, TXAustin, TX	0	0	0	0	0	0			1092-1648		978-1-4673-2447-2	WOS:000318647500047

Traffic Redundancy Elimination (TRE) has been shown to be an effective solution for reducing bandwidth costs, and has recently captured significant attention in the cloud environment. By studying the TRE techniques with a trace driven approach, we found that solely using either sender-based TRE or receiver-based TRE cannot simultaneously capture traffic redundancy in both short-term (time span of seconds) and long-term (time span of hours or days) data redundancy, which concurrently appear in the traffic. Additionally, the TRE efficiency of existing receiver-based TRE solution is susceptible to data changes compared to historical data in the cache. In this paper, we propose a sender and receiver Cooperative end-to-end TRE solution (CoRE) for efficiently identifying and removing both short-term and long-term redundancy. Through a two-layer redundancy detection design and one single pass algorithm for chunking and fingerprinting, CoRE efficiently carries out cooperative operations between the sender and the receiver. By extensive evaluation with several real traces, we show that CoRE is able to identify both short-term and long-term redundancy with low additional cost, while ensuring TRE efficiency from data changes.					20th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP)20th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP)	OCT 30-NOV 02, 2012OCT 30-NOV 02, 2012	IEEEIEEE	Austin, TXAustin, TX	0	0	0	0	0	0			1092-1648		978-1-4673-2447-2; 978-1-4673-2445-8	WOS:000318647500037

Our approach relies on a 3D nonlinear energy minimization framework to solve for the configuration using a semi-implicit scheme. Results show various scenarios of dynamic posters and shirts in different configurations to illustrate the performance of the method.

Our approach combines data from an odometry sensor with output from a visual registration algorithm, and it enforces a Manhattan world constraint by utilizing factor graphs to produce an accurate online estimate of the trajectory of a mobile robotic platform. We also examine the advantages and limitations of the octree data structure representation of a 3D environment. Through several experiments in environments with varying sizes and construction we show that our method reduces rotational and translational drift significantly without performing any loop closing techniques.					25th IEEE\RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)25th IEEE\RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)	OCT 07-12, 2012OCT 07-12, 2012	IEEE Robot & Automat Soc (RAS); IEEE Ind Elect Soc (IES); Robot Soc Japan (RSJ); Soc Instrument & Control Engineers (SICE); New technol Fdn (NTF); Inst Control Robot & Syst (ICROS); IEEE; Adept MobileRobots; Willow Garage; Aldebaran Robot; Natl Instruments; Reflexxes GmbH; Schunk Intec S L UIEEE Robot & Automat Soc (RAS); IEEE Ind Elect Soc (IES); Robot Soc Japan (RSJ); Soc Instrument & Control Engineers (SICE); New technol Fdn (NTF); Inst Control Robot & Syst (ICROS); IEEE; Adept MobileRobots; Willow Garage; Aldebaran Robot; Natl Instruments; Reflexxes GmbH; Schunk Intec S L U	Algarve, PORTUGALAlgarve, PORTUGAL	2	0	0	0	0	2			2153-0858		978-1-4673-1736-8	WOS:000317042705138

The scheduler algorithms consider peak traffic and link reliability, achieving savings of channel resources and reducing the number of retransmissions. A key feature of the proposed schedulers is the use side information in the form of a coverage map, which provides a map of link quality for the area covered by the radio access networks. In this paper, the total offered load and average excess delay are considered as two metrics for measuring the proposed schedulers, which are evaluated by simulation results. The performance of schedulers is reported and compared.					76th IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Fall)76th IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC Fall)	SEP 03-06, 2012SEP 03-06, 2012	IEEEIEEE	Quebec City, CANADAQuebec City, CANADA	0	0	0	0	0	0			1550-2252		978-1-4673-1879-2	WOS:000317009100319

A parameter called the current division factor or imbalance factor uniquely defines the degree of imbalance of a transmission line. The imbalance difference model shows that changes in the imbalance are responsible for differential-mode to common-mode conversion. This paper explores various circuit board and cable geometries to illustrate how the imbalance difference model would be applied, and to determine how well common-mode currents obtained using the imbalance difference model compare to full-wave calculations.

The novelty is in the use of a single-phase controlled rectifier with a backstepping controller to track the maximum power operating point (MPOP) for a string of PV arrays under varying atmospheric conditions. The stability of the controller is demonstrated by means of a Lyapunov analysis. A circuit level simulation demonstrates that the designed converter and control strategy transfers power to the grid by efficiently tracking the MPOP.

Experimental methods alone are generally too limited to provide the atomistic level of detail that is needed to characterize the molecular interactions that are involved. Molecular modeling methods, on the other hand, are inherently able to provide this capability. However, these computational methods require experimental data for tuning and validation before they can be confidently applied. In order to address this 'chicken-or-the-egg' type of problem, we are working on the synergistic development of experimental methods to provide the kinds of data that are needed to both tune and validate molecular simulation methods along with simulation methods that are needed for proper comparison with experimental results. The combination of these methods paves the way towards accurate prediction of protein adsorption behavior. Once developed, these methods have the potential to provide a valuable tool to help understand, predict, and control protein-surface interactions.

J	Ross, Brandon E.; Hamilton, H. R.; Potter, William								Effect of Bearing Pad Arrangement on Capacity of Slab Panel Bridge Members								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD					2313			92	99		10.3141/2313-10			2012	2012	Slab panel bridges (elsewhere referred to as flat-slab bridges) are constructed with multiple precast pretensioned slab panels that are placed side by side and act compositely with a cast-in-place concrete topping. Design standards from the Florida Department of Transportation specify that individual slab panels be supported by a tripod system of bearing pads. A single bearing pad is placed at one end, and two bearing pads at the opposite end. This paper presents experimental research on the effect that this bearing pad arrangement has on the behavior and capacity of slab panel members. Four full-scale tests on slab panels were conducted, with variables that included the bearing pad arrangement (single or double bearing), and the position of the load point [shear span-to-depth (a/d) ratio of 2.0 and 3.3]. For slab panels loaded at a/d of 3.3, test results indicated that the behavior and capacity were independent of the bearing pad arrangement. For the panel loaded at a/d of 2.0 with a single bearing pad, the failure mode was bond shear. The panel loaded at a/d of 2.0 with two bearing pads failed in flexure. Experimental results were compared with theoretical capacities calculated with American Concrete Institute and AASHTO codes. Design recommendations were made on the basis of the experimental results and on the comparison with theoretical capacities.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0361-1981			WOS:000316040400010

In turn, habitat selection involves the interplay between choices made by individuals and the consequences of these choices. Larvae of Simulium ubiquitum Adler, Currie and Wood, 2004 (Diptera: Simuliidae) are filter-feeders that live in a variety of lotic habitats. Using larval size as a proxy for adult fitness, we examined whether size varied over a heterogeneous riverscape. Regression analysis showed a significant (P < 0.001) negative relation of larval size and stream temperature, depth and discharge, and a significant positive relation with stream width. Habitat selection, therefore, has fitness consequence for S. ubiquitum. No significant difference was found in head-capsule size between male and female final-instar larvae.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0165-0424			WOS:000311558800005

PTSL is characterized by premature tree death, resulting in substantial economic losses. In previous work, the rootstock Guardian (R) 'BY520-9' was selected for its tolerance of PTSL. To investigate the genetic and molecular basis for this tolerance, Nemaguard, a PTSL susceptible rootstock, and Guardian (R) selection 3-17-7 were crossed. The F-1 plants were self-pollinated to create segregating F-2 populations. The trees were rated annually from 2004 through 2008 for their response to PTSL. 176 microsatellite/Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) markers, each mapping to a specific chromosomal location on the Prunus reference nuclear genome, were used to screen the two parents and F-1-11. Only 53 markers showed polymorphism among the parents, and were heterozygous in F1-11. These SSRs were then screened on the F-2-11 population (N=100). Segregation data for PTSL-response and SSR marker inheritance were complied and subjected to Analysis of Variance to determine differences in Genotypic Means (GMs). Nine SSR loci correlate with a response to PTSL and are distributed on four linkage groups (e. g., Linkage Group-1, LG-2, LG-4 and LG-6). Four of the nine loci (EPDCU5100, pacita27, UDA008 and UDA029) appear to account for most of the variance in the trait based upon their large GMs (>2.5). After creating a molecular map from the segregation data, analysis identified a quantitative locus (QTL) on LG2 that was important in all five years of the study. In addition, this chromosomal interval contained three of the four SSR marker loci that accounted for the majority of the variation. These results identify regions of the peach genome where genes controlling PTSL susceptibility and tolerance reside, thus helping to define the genetic basis for response to PTSL as a complex but tractable trait.					28th Int Horticultural Congress on Science and Horticulture for People (IHC) / Int Symposium on Genomics and Genetic Transformation of Horticultural Crops28th Int Horticultural Congress on Science and Horticulture for People (IHC) / Int Symposium on Genomics and Genetic Transformation of Horticultural Crops	AUG 22-27, 2010AUG 22-27, 2010		Lisbon, PORTUGALLisbon, PORTUGAL	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-90-66050-48-8	WOS:000314786100001

America. DNA sequencing of a 658-base pair region of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase c subunit I gene revealed 7 haplotype groups within the genus Diplectrona: Four with larvae similar to Diplectrona modesta Banks, two with larvae similar to D. metaqui Ross, and one that is a putative match to D. marianae Reeves. These results provide initial evidence supporting the need for a revision of the genus Diplectrona in N. America, and also possibly for the existence of cryptic diversity within currently recognized Diplectrona species. We discuss these results within the context of the intersection of bioassessment, molecular and morphological taxonomy, and the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature.

Efficiency of Microwave Heating of Weakly Loaded Polymeric Nanocomposites								JOURNAL OF ENGINEERED FIBERS AND FABRICS				7		SI		42	49					2012	2012	Electrical and thermal conductivity of materials are typically correlated, while some applications, including thermoelectrics, require these parameters to be controlled independently. Such independent control of thermal and electromagnetic properties can be achieved by using nanocomposites. In this study, nanocomposites were produced by mixing a small amount of carbon nanofibers (CNF), carbon coated cobalt (Co), and nickel nanowires (NiNW) with paraffin, which has low thermal and almost zero electrical conductivity. The fraction of nanoinclusions in the paraffin matrix was very low (below 1%). We showed that the thermal properties of nanocomposites are essentially the same as those of pure paraffin, while electromagnetic properties are significantly different. To determine the dependence of the heating rate on filler concentration, paraffin-based samples were heated in a microwave oven. We found that the heating rate of nanocomposites made of carbon nanofibers is much greater than that of any other nanocomposites. These findings suggest that at 2.45 GHz frequency, the heating rate is mostly controlled by the electrical losses in the fillers. The theoretical model predicts that the heating rate increases linearly with the particle concentration, which is in agreement with the experimental data.

Bending and Position Hysteresis of Magnetic Microfibers in Nonuniform Magnetic Fields								JOURNAL OF ENGINEERED FIBERS AND FABRICS				7		SI		74	83					2012	2012	Magnetic microfibers are fibers that behave as a flexible paramagnetic body, for example, polymer fibers filled with superparamagnetic particles. A cantilevered magnetic microfiber will bend in response to an applied magnetic field. In a nonuniform field, generated for example by a single electromagnet or by a magnetic dipole, a magnetic microfiber displays position hysteresis as the field strength increases and decreases. This paper presents a model for determining stable shapes of a cantilevered magnetic microfiber in a nonuniform magnetic field. The model determines stable shapes by finding local minima of the potential energy using a Rayleigh-Ritz method. The model predicts the position hysteresis behavior observed in magnetic microfibers. Experimental data ware collected using two electromagnets with different geometries. The model simulation and experimental data compare well both qualitatively and quantitatively. The model will be useful for designing actuators based on magnetic microfibers and for characterizing the magnetic properties of fabricated fibers. A rigid bar model is also introduced, which captures the qualitative behavior of the fiber and illustrates the source of the position hysteresis behavior.

J	Goethals, Paul L.; Cho, Byung Rae								Solving the optimal process target problem using computer-generated experimental designs								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING				6	2			234	258		10.1504/EJIE.2012.045607			2012	2012	For any given manufacturing system, the initial setting of the process target is critical in preventing excessive product rejection and rework costs. Often referred to as the 'process target problem', the traditional approach relies first on the assumption of certain values for the process mean and variance, prior to identifying the optimal setting. This paper, in contrast, proposes integrating estimated response surface functions developed for the mean and variance based upon observations made on a given process, thus removing any assumption on the parameters. In addition, this paper considers non-standard experimental regions, where constraints may exist on the factor space or restrictions are implemented on the number of experimental runs conducted. In doing so, greater flexibility is obtained in finding solutions to process target problems and the scope of the research field is broadened. Non-linear programming methods are used to facilitate this approach, and numerical examples are provided to illustrate findings.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1751-5254			WOS:000300882600006

The development of a viable biorecognition interface using SiC as the substrate material for bio-detection is described. Surface modification with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) and immobilization via covalent conjugation of anti-myoglobin (anti-Myo) on the modified surfaces is achieved, which are initial steps for immunosensing based devices. Successful formation of APTES layers and antibody immobilization were identified with surface water contact angle (SWCA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM).					34th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)34th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)	AUG 28-SEP 01, 2012AUG 28-SEP 01, 2012	IEEE; Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS); CAS; SMC; PubMed; MEDLINEIEEE; Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS); CAS; SMC; PubMed; MEDLINE	San Diego, CASan Diego, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0			1557-170X		978-1-4577-1787-1	WOS:000313296501223

The performance of these new feature sets is superior to Guler's classic features in both sensitivity and specificity. In addition, the use of (scalp electrode) spatial information is also shown to improve EEG classification. Finally, a new strategy based upon concurrent use of several mother wavelets is shown to result in increased sensitivity and specificity. Various attempts at reducing feature vector dimension are shown.

It combines aspects of genetic algorithm with competitive learning. The learning rate in the standard PBIL is generally fixed which makes it difficult for the algorithm to explore the search space effectively. In this paper, the standard PBIL is improved by using a combination of adaptive and fixed learning rate that varies according to the generation. The adaptive-fixed (AF) algorithm can adjust the learning rate automatically according to the degree of evolution of the search. The objective of the power system stabilizer (PSS) design is to achieve adequate stability over a wide range of power system operating conditions. The proposed controller is compared with conventional PBIL with fixed learning rate (PBIL) and tested under various operating conditions. Simulation results show that the AFPBIL based PSS provides a more efficient search capability and gives a better damping and adequate dynamic performance of the system than the conventional PBIL based PSS.

B	Guo, Longjiang; Duan, Jinsheng; Li, Jinbao; Yu, Lei; Shen, Haiying			IEEE					HAS: Hidden Anti-Theft System Based on Wireless Sensor Networks								2012 IEEE 31ST INTERNATIONAL PERFORMANCE COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE (IPCCC)								162	170					2012	2012	Wireless sensor networks(WSNs) are being widely deployed for many monitoring applications, of which a popular one is anti-theft. However, current WSN technologies for anti-theft are either very susceptible to the environment interference or easily compromised by the thieves. Hence, they fail to achieve the desired effectiveness in many anti-theft scenarios. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Hidden Anti-theft System (HAS) to monitor theft intrusion, which is based on the influences of theft intrusion on signal strength according to the shadowing effect in wireless communication. The theft intrusion is detected by finding abnormal RSSI samples of a wireless link compared with the stable range of signal strength in the link's normal state. Through the proposed monitoring approach, HAS can effectively detect intrusion while keeping invisible. In HAS system, to achieve load balance for detection task, we propose an efficient algorithm to determine the set of links that each node monitors. To reduce the response time, a dual-layer scanning solution with dual-radio nodes is proposed to scan the monitoring area more intensively. The experiment results show that the efficiency of HAS. HAS achieves very low false positive and false negative rates, and the response time of dual-layer scanning is 54.2% less than single layer scanning.					31st IEEE International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC)31st IEEE International Performance Computing and Communications Conference (IPCCC)	DEC 01-03, 2012DEC 01-03, 2012	IEEE Comp Soc; IEEECS TCSIM; IEEEIEEE Comp Soc; IEEECS TCSIM; IEEE	Austin, TXAustin, TX	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4673-4883-6; 978-1-4673-4881-2	WOS:000313524400019

With the future mixed traffic, the current platooning concept comes to its limitations when human-driven vehicles interfere with the platoon between the autonomous vehicles without negotiation. In this interfering situation, most of them have to break down into two platoons, which may ensure the safety while lose the efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a self-defensive coordinated maneuvering strategy to generalize platooning to situations with non-automated interfering vehicles in mixed traffic. It allows the vehicles in the platoon to observe the interfering vehicles' behaviors, predict their intentions, and then react by changing their platoon formations so as to keep such vehicles always out of the platoon. In the proposed framework, the platoon can not only "talk" and "listen" for cooperative driving based on the communication system, but also "guessing" and "reacting" to actively defend the completeness based on the on-board sensors. Therefore, higher safety and efficiency can be expected. Simulation results in various typical but challenging interfering situations with mixed traffic show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.					15th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)15th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)	SEP 16-19, 2012SEP 16-19, 2012		Anchorage, AKAnchorage, AK	0	0	0	0	0	0			2153-0009		978-1-4673-3063-3	WOS:000312599600286

Emerging methods are beginning to address this challenge by exploiting online social networks (OSNs). However, current OSN-based methods simply cluster common-interest nodes for high efficiency or limit the interaction between social friends for high trustworthiness, which provides limited enhancement or contradicts the open and free service goal of P2P systems. Little research has been undertaken to fully and cooperatively leverage OSNs with integrated consideration of proximity and interest. In this work, we analyze a BitTorrent file sharing trace, which proves the necessity of proximity-and interest-aware clustering. Based on the trace study and OSN properties, we propose a SOcial Network integrated P2P file sharing system with enhanced Efficiency and Trustworthiness (SoNet) to fully and cooperatively leverage the common-interest, proximity-close and trust properties of OSN friends. SoNet uses a hierarchical distributed hash table (DHT) to cluster common-interest nodes, then further cluster proximity-close nodes into subcluster, and connects the nodes in a subcluster with social links. Thus, when queries travel along trustable social links, they also gain higher probability of being successfully resolved by proximity-close nodes, simultaneously enhancing efficiency and trustworthiness. The results of trace-driven experiments on the real-world PlanetLab testbed demonstrate the higher efficiency and trustworthiness of SoNet compared with other systems.					12th IEEE International Conference on Peer-to-Peer Computing (P2P)12th IEEE International Conference on Peer-to-Peer Computing (P2P)	SEP 03-05, 2012SEP 03-05, 2012	IEEEIEEE	Tarragona, SPAINTarragona, SPAIN	4	0	0	1	0	4			2161-3567		978-1-4673-2862-3	WOS:000312674500027

J	Schaffer, Meline; Taylor, Mary Anne								Job search behaviors among African-Americans								JOURNAL OF MANAGERIAL PSYCHOLOGY				27	8			814	828		10.1108/02683941211280175			2012	2012	Purpose - Research suggests that both internal and external resources are important in determining the level and intensity of job search behaviors among unemployed individuals. Specifically, an external resource, social support, and an internal resource, self-efficacy, can have positive, facilitative effects on job search efforts. While these relationships are well-established, the psychological mechanisms that explain the link between these resources and job search behaviors are unclear. This paper aims to explore positive coping and distancing as potential mediators of this linkage in an African-American sample.Design/methodology/approach - Participants responded to a survey containing the variables of interest at two job fairs in the Southeastern USA (n = 223). Of participants, 70 percent were female and the average age was 39. In total, 37 percent of respondents had an undergraduate degree or a more advanced degree, and the average length of unemployment was 9.9 months.Findings - Results suggest that the effects of both social support and self-efficacy on job searches may be due to their impact on positive coping behaviors, which in turn are significantly related to increased search behaviors. Thus, positive coping had a consistent mediational role in explaining how higher levels of social support and more favorable levels of self-efficacy enhance the intensity of two forms of job search behaviors. Distancing coping had a less significant and less consistent role as a mediator.Practical implications - This suggests that interventions meant to enhance self-efficacy and social support of job seekers may have positive effects on actively applying for jobs and on enlisting the help of others in finding jobs among African-Americans, as well as on the positive coping skills of the unemployed. Interventions should strive to increase these resources while simultaneously providing realistic expectations regarding the probability of finding a job well-suited for the job seeker. This argues for the potential effectiveness of individually formulated plans for securing employment.Originality/value - The paper emphasizes the importance of coping strategies used by unemployed individuals as a factor in job search intensity.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0268-3946			WOS:000312676700004

The launch window is currently planned for between 2022 and 2024. LOFT is designed to exploit the diagnostics of rapid X-ray flux and spectral variability that directly probe the motion of matter down to distances very close to black holes and neutron stars, as well as the physical state of ultradense matter. These primary science goals will be addressed by a payload composed of a Large Area Detector (LAD) and a Wide Field Monitor (WFM). The LAD is a collimated (<1 degree field of view) experiment operating in the energy range 2-50 keV, with a 10 m(2) peak effective area and an energy resolution of 260 eV at 6 keV. The WFM will operate in the same energy range as the LAD, enabling simultaneous monitoring of a few-steradian wide field of view, with an angular resolution of <5 arcmin. The LAD and WFM experiments will allow us to investigate variability from submillisecond QPO's to yearlong transient outbursts. In this paper we report the current status of the project.

The efficacy of our method is demonstrated in two distinctly different configurations: a custom Wheatstone stereoscope, and a commodity active stereo graphics display. We employ a 3D calibration process that determines the parameters of an affine mapping from a depth estimate, based on triangulation using onscreen horizontal disparity, to a refined depth estimate. Triangulation accounts for most of the non-linearity in the transform, and our calibration accounts for individual differences in eye separation and vergence behavior. We demonstrate that, although different binocular eye trackers are used with each display, our approach to online estimation of gaze depth performs similarly on both systems. Importantly, results show that depth estimation error is biased toward the display screen, underestimating target distance from the screen both behind and in front of the screen.					2nd Joint 3DIM/3DPVT International Conference on 3D Imaging, Modeling, Processing, Visualization and Transmission (3DIMPVT)2nd Joint 3DIM/3DPVT International Conference on 3D Imaging, Modeling, Processing, Visualization and Transmission (3DIMPVT)	OCT 13-15, 2012OCT 13-15, 2012	Disney Res; Leica Geosystems; Hexagon; Adobe; RealD; Qualcomm; Mitsubishi Elect; Google; 4D View Solut; SRI Int; Swiss Fed Inst Technol Zurich; Univ N Carolina Chapel Hill; Eurograph AssocDisney Res; Leica Geosystems; Hexagon; Adobe; RealD; Qualcomm; Mitsubishi Elect; Google; 4D View Solut; SRI Int; Swiss Fed Inst Technol Zurich; Univ N Carolina Chapel Hill; Eurograph Assoc	ETH Zurich, Zurich, SWITZERLANDETH Zurich, Zurich, SWITZERLAND	2	0	0	0	0	2					978-0-7695-4873-9	WOS:000337507600024

Moysey, Stephen/H-4658-2012; 	Ryan, James/0000-0002-8420-2528			Multi-offset ground-penetrating radar imaging of a lab-scale infiltration test								HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES				16	11			4009	4022		10.5194/hess-16-4009-2012			2012	2012	A lab scale infiltration experiment was conducted in a sand tank to evaluate the use of time-lapse multi-offset ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data for monitoring dynamic hydrologic events in the vadose zone. Sets of 21 GPR traces at offsets between 0.44-0.9 m were recorded every 30 s during a 3 h infiltration experiment to produce a data cube that can be viewed as multi-offset gathers at unique times or common offset images, tracking changes in arrivals through time. Specifically, we investigated whether this data can be used to estimate changes in average soil water content during wetting and drying and to track the migration of the wetting front during an infiltration event. For the first problem we found that normal-moveout (NMO) analysis of the GPR reflection from the bottom of the sand layer provided water content estimates ranging between 0.10-0.30 volumetric water content, which underestimated the value determined by depth averaging a vertical array of six moisture probes by 0.03-0.05 volumetric water content. Relative errors in the estimated depth to the bottom of the 0.6 m thick sand layer were typically on the order of 2%, though increased as high as 25% as the wetting front approached the bottom of the tank. NMO analysis of the wetting front reflection during the infiltration event generally underestimated the depth of the front with discrepancies between GPR and moisture probe estimates approaching 0.15 m. The analysis also resulted in underestimates of water content in the wetted zone on the order of 0.06 volumetric water content and a wetting front velocity equal to about half the rate inferred from the probe measurements. In a parallel modeling effort we found that HYDRUS-1D also underestimates the observed average tank water content determined from the probes by approximately 0.01-0.03 volumetric water content, despite the fact that the model was calibrated to the probe data. This error suggests that the assumed conceptual model of laterally uniform, one-dimensional vertical flow in a homogenous material may not be fully appropriate for the experiment. Full-waveform modeling and subsequent NMO analysis of the simulated GPR response resulted in water content errors on the order of 0.01-0.03 volumetric water content, which are roughly 30-50% of the discrepancy between GPR and probe results observed in the experiment. The model shows that interference between wave arrivals affects data interpretation and the estimation of traveltimes. This is an important source of error in the NMO analysis, but it does not fully account for the discrepancies between GPR and the moisture probes observed in the experiment. The remaining discrepancy may be related to conceptual errors underlying the GPR analysis, such as the assumption of uniform one-dimensional flow, a lack of a sharply defined wetting front in the experiment, and errors in the petrophysical model used to convert dielectric constant to water content.									11	0	0	2	0	11			1027-5606	1607-7938		WOS:000311514600006

The fossil fuel based global economy is not sustainable. For sustainable global green energy scenario we must consider free fuel based energy conversion, environmental concerns and conservation of water. Photovoltaics (PV) offers a unique opportunity to solve the 21st century's electricity generation because solar energy is essentially unlimited and PV systems provide electricity without any undesirable impact on the environment. Innovative paths for green energy conversion and storage are proposed in areas of R&D, manufacturing & system integration, energy policy and financing. With existing silicon PV system manufacturing, the implementation of new innovative energy policies and new innovative business model can provide immediately large capacity of electricity generation to developed, emerging and underdeveloped economies.

Drive-by-wire systems use servo-motors, with accompanying sensors and control algorithms, to regulate the vehicle's operation. In this paper, a multi-modal human-vehicle haptic interface has been developed for ground vehicle steer-by-wire systems. The mathematical model and control structure offer tunable gains that allow the emphasis of different feedback factors including steering stiffness, damping, power assist, aligning torques, end stop, and static friction. Three steering system factors were assessed: control and confidence, ease of use, and perceived vehicle safety. As measured, driver performance improved with the provision of aligning torque plus stiffness and damping effects. Subjective and objective operator-in-the-loop results demonstrated that the driver experience can be positively impacted using a reconfigurable force feedback formulation.

Here, we compare the energetics of early development of a tropical ophiuroid, Ophiocoma alexandri, and a temperate to tropical echinoid, Arbacia punctulata, two species with similarly sized eggs. Measurements of respiration and constituent analyses were performed on eggs and unfed larvae of both species. Members of both species showed an increase in oxygen consumption during morphogenesis followed by a lower, static rate once morphogenesis was complete (3 d for O. alexandri and 1.3 d for A. punctulata). Compared to the echinoid larvae, the ophiuroid larvae developed more slowly and had peak respiration rates that were 3.1x lower. Eggs of O. alexandri contained significantly more protein and significantly less triacylglycerol than eggs of A. punctulata. Energy utilization, as calculated via respiration measurements, closely matched decreases in energy content from the eggs to larvae as measured with biochemical constituent assays. Larvae of A. punctulata used 1.4x more energy to reach the pluteus stage than larvae of O. alexandri, and used 4x more energy during the first 9 d of larval life. These data suggest that echinoid larvae require more energy to develop to the feeding stage than ophiuroid larvae, and likewise have higher requirements for maintenance metabolism. Ophiuroid larvae may be more tolerant of low food levels due to their very low metabolic rates, but this advantage may be offset by their slower rate of development.									3	0	0	3	0	3			1077-8306			WOS:000312218400008

Nonetheless, a significant number of these stars do not share this r-process template. We suggest that many such stars have begun an r-process, but it was prevented from running to completion in more massive stars by collapse to black holes, creating a "truncated r-process", or "tr-process". The observed fraction of tr-process stars is found to be consistent with expectations from the initial mass function (IMF), and we suggest that an apparent sharp truncation observed at around mass 160 could result from a combination of collapses to black holes and the difficulty of observing the higher mass rare earths. We test the tr-process hypothesis with calculations that are terminated before all r-process trajectories have been ejected. These produce qualitative agreement with observation when both black hole collapse and observational realities are taken into account					International Symposium on Origin of Matter and Evolutions of Galaxies (OMEG)International Symposium on Origin of Matter and Evolutions of Galaxies (OMEG)	NOV 14-17, 2011NOV 14-17, 2011	RIKEN Nishina Ctr (RNC); Natl Astronom Observ Japan (NAO); Inst Particle & Nucl Studies; Osaka Univ, Res Ctr Nucl Phys (RCNP); Konan Univ, Fac Sci & Engn; Hokkaido Univ, Fac Sci; High Energy Accelerator Res Org (KEK)RIKEN Nishina Ctr (RNC); Natl Astronom Observ Japan (NAO); Inst Particle & Nucl Studies; Osaka Univ, Res Ctr Nucl Phys (RCNP); Konan Univ, Fac Sci & Engn; Hokkaido Univ, Fac Sci; High Energy Accelerator Res Org (KEK)	Univ Tokyo, Ctr Nucl Study (CNS), Wako, JAPANUniv Tokyo, Ctr Nucl Study (CNS), Wako, JAPAN	0	0	0	0	0	0			0094-243X		978-0-7354-1096-1	WOS:000312157700018

Forest Resource Management Plans: A Sustainability Approach								Journal of Natural Resources and Life Sciences Education				41				79	86		10.4195/jnrlse.2012.0002n			2012	2012	Forest Resource Management Plans is the capstone course in many forestry and natural resource management curricula. The management plans are developed by senior forestry students. Early management plans courses were commonly technical exercises, often performed on contrived forest "tracts" on university-owned or other public lands, with a goal of generating standard reports showing silvicultural, forest management, and timber harvesting activities. This early timber-oriented management approach gradually changed late in the last century into one that was oriented around real-world private forest landowners. Various types of actual forest properties and owner types were used for the exercises, but family forest properties tended to be stressed because they represent one of the most common types of management plans. Also, the timber emphasis changed to a multiple-use emphasis (with major considerations of nontimber resources, like wildlife, recreation, water, soils, and aesthetics). Forestry students were exposed to real-world forest owners and linked to practicing professional foresters who currently managed these properties. This same approach is being used to introduce forestry students to a major new emphasis: forest sustainability and forest certification. Sustainable forest management has grown into a major thrust of forestry for economic and ecological interests and forest certification systems are now crucial to ensuring sustainability. Clemson University is incorporating a major American forest certification system for family forest owners into its curriculum and capstone course to strengthen student understanding of these essential concepts. It represents an expansion of the landowner approach to broaden the capstone course to emphasis forest sustainability issues.									0	0	0	1	0	1			1059-9053			BCI:BCI201300099963

Development of low-cost sky-scanning Fabry-Perot interferometers for airglow and auroral studies								EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE				64	11			1033	1046		10.5047/eps.2012.05.004			2012	2012	We have developed new Fabry-Perot interferometers (FPIs) that are designed to measure thermospheric winds and temperatures as well as mesospheric winds through the airglow/aurora emissions at wavelengths of 630.0 nm and 557.7 nm, respectively. One FPI (FP01), possessing a large aperture etalon (diameter: 116 mm), was installed at the EISCAT Tromso site in 2009. The other FPIs, using 70-mm diameter etalons, were installed in Thailand, Indonesia, and Australia in 2010-2011 (FP02-FP04) by the Solar-Terrestrial Environment Laboratory, and in Peru (Nazca and Jicamarca) and Alaska (Poker Flat) by Clemson University. The FPIs with 70-mm etalons are low-cost compact instruments, suitable for multipoint network observations. All of these FPIs use low-noise cooled-CCD detectors with 1024 x 1024 pixels combined with a 4-stage thermoelectric cooling system that can cool the CCD temperature down to -80 degrees C. The large incident angle (maximum: 1.3 degrees-1.4 degrees) to the etalon achieved by the use of multiple orders increases the throughput of the FPIs. The airglow and aurora observations at Tromso by FP01 show wind velocities with typical random errors ranging from 2 to 13 m s(-1) and from 4 to 27 m s(-1) for mesosphere (557.7 nm) and thermosphere (630.0 nm) measurements, respectively. The 630.0-nm airglow observations at Shigaraki, Japan, by FP02-FP04 and by the American FPI instruments give thermospheric wind velocities with typical random errors that vary from 2 m s(-1) to more than 50 m s(-1) depending on airglow intensity.									14	4	0	2	0	17			1343-8832			WOS:000312004000005

We have previously shown that efficient, reversible redox couples can be incorporated in conventional conducting polymers to increase the energy and power density of redox electrodes; and furthermore, that molecular variations can be used to influence the molecular structure thereby enhancing Faradaic charge storage capacity. Here, we show that the energy storage capacity of these conducting polymer electrodes can be increased using electrochemical polymerization of multiple monomers with similar oxidation potentials. Low-cost thiophene monomers are incorporated with triarylamine-derivatives to vary the number of thiophenes and conjugation length between redox-centers. The composition of each monomer is systematically varied to identify the optimal composition that provides the highest charge capacity with reduced cost. Compared to the pure homopolymers, a factor of 2 increase in charge capacity is achieved for copolymers prepared with 10 mol% triarylamine groups using simple electrochemical synthesis. These results indicate that a simple building block approach to conducting polymer electrode design can be achieved when proper consideration is given to the polymer precursors.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0959-9428			WOS:000311970800058

Large-scale complexations were formed for both types of dendritic polymers hosting the linear but not the polyaromatic hydrocarbon. Furthermore, both types of dendritic polymers exhibited a strong and comparable hosting/dispersion capacity for the polyaromatic hydrocarbon, while the hyperbranched polymers at concentrations below 30 mu M showed a consistently higher hosting capacity than the dendrimers for the linear hydrocarbon. Such complexity in hosting capacity of the two types of dendritic polymers is attributed to the more hydrophobic interior and less steric hindrance of the hyperbranched polymers for the partitioning of the hydrocarbons.									8	0	0	5	0	8			2046-2069			WOS:000312061000008

The synthesis involves a process in which ethylene oxide is polymerized using a trivinyl initiator, modified with carboxylic acid using a free radical addition of mercaptoundecanoic acid, and then functionalized with nitroDOPA using N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) chemistry. This newly synthesized polymer is then compared to more traditional monofunctional catechol based ligands of similar molecular weights (similar to 5000 g mol(-1)), by testing their effectiveness at stabilizing magnetite nanoparticles (similar to 6.5 nm in diameter) in biological media. Colloidal stability was tested using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) to observe the change in particle stability when influenced by phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The time dependent stability of these polymer-coated aqueous suspensions of magnetite was then analysed using DLS to observe the change in the hydrodynamic diameter as a function of time in both PBS and fetal bovine serum (FBS). It was observed over the course of this study that magnetite particles stabilized with PEO-tri-nitroDOPA were more stable than their monofunctional counterparts, retaining stability inside PBS for extended periods of time with no sign of significant hydrodynamic size change and only 8.1% polymer loss over 48 hours in PBS. This is a significant improvement compared to the monocoatechol polymer ligands, where losses of polymer coating of 32.2% were recorded along with large increases of hydrodynamic diameter. The tri-nitroDOPA polymer also displayed stability in FBS over 24 hours, as where the monocatechol ligands displayed heavy clustering and sedimentation over the same time period.									20	0	0	2	0	20			0959-9428	1364-5501		WOS:000311808200055

Selected mixtures of GaP nanoparticles, based on dimensions, exhibit at room temperature bright broad band luminescence from UV until yellow-red region with controlled band-width and spectral position of maximum. Poly (2-vinylpyridine) (P2VP), biphenyl vinyl ether (BPVE) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) polymers were used to prepare GaP based nanocomposites. The resulting nanocomposites showed pronounced quantum confinement effects and other discussed in this work important for application interesting phenomena leading to dramatic I eV expansion of GaP luminescence to the UV spectral region. These GaP nanoparticles and GaP/polymer nanocomposites provide significant enhancement of blue-shifted luminescence from which novel light emissive device structures may be fashioned.

J	Young, Shawn P.; Ingram, Travis R.; Tannehill, Josh E.; Isely, J. Jeffery								Passage of Spawning Alabama Shad at Jim Woodruff Lock and Dam, Apalachicola River, Florida								TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY				141	4			881	889		10.1080/00028487.2012.675917			2012	2012	In 2005, a pilot study was initiated to evaluate the potential use of the navigation lock at Jim Woodruff Lock and Dam (JWLD), Florida, as a means for fish passage. The focal species was the Alabama shad Alosa alabamae. The Apalachicola River population is one of the last-remaining, extant self-sustaining populations, estimated adult spawning returns ranging from lows of 5,211 to 14,674 individuals in 2007 to highs of 51,417 to 127,251 individuals in 2010. We estimated the passage of migrating Alabama shad during spawning migrations during March-May 2005, 2007, 2010, and 2011. During 2005, 23 of 36 Alabama shad that were implanted with transmitters successfully passed from the lock into the reservoir 1-7 d after release, for a passage rate of 64% (95% CI = 48-80%). Advancing on the promising results from 2005, voluntary passage was evaluated during spring 2007, 2010, and 2011. During these years, 63-100% of implanted shad were relocated at the lock at least once, and voluntary passage ranged from 33% to 45%. Voluntary passage occurred 3-39 d postimplanting, most shad passing < 28 d after initial capture. Implanted Alabama shad were subsequently relocated upstream in both the Flint and Chattahoochee rivers. Based on these results, the navigation lock at JWLD was an effective means to pass migrating Alabama shad. Increased passage could be achieved by maximizing attraction flow near the lock entrance and increasing the time the upper gates are open during an afternoon locking cycle. By coupling passage and population estimates, the total number of shad that migrated through JWLD ranged from 2,137 in 2007 to 57,262 in 2010.									5	0	0	5	0	5			0002-8487			WOS:000306462500003

Several methods in the time and spectral domain have previously been devised to conduct such a test. Here, we explore a new approach to the problem by comparing sample arc lengths (ALs) of the two series. Because sample ALs are derived from first-order differences in the series, the proposed methods work for both stationary autoregressive moving average and non-stationary autoregressive integrated moving average processes. This robustness is advantageous when one is unsure about unit root properties in the underlying series.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0094-9655			WOS:000310959200008

Since there are a large number of solutions to these kinds of problems, to reduce the computational effort and to provide more desirable and meaningful solutions to the decision maker, this research focuses on using interactive input from the user to explore the most desirable parts of the efficient frontier instead of trying to reproduce the entire frontier. Here, users define their preferences by selecting among five classes of objective functions and by specifying weighting coefficients, bounds, and optional upper bounds on indifference tradeoffs. This structure is married with the memetic algorithm - a random-key genetic algorithm hybridised by local search. The resulting methodology is an iterative process that continues until the decision maker is satisfied with the solution. The paper concludes with case studies utilising different scenarios to illustrate possible manufacturing and production related implementations of the methodology.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0020-7543			WOS:000310595700001

We introduce a new ellipsoid measure and use it to analyze and select the optimal shape and motion of tunable continuum hooks for given terrains and climbing scenarios. This new ellipsoid is a generalization of impact ellipsoids used previously for traditional rigid-link robots. We illustrate and support the analysis using results from laboratory experiments using a novel robot rover with continuum appendages developed by our research group.

Better observability results in better control actions. A limiting factor to this approach is communication delays. Power system wide area communication delays range from several milliseconds to several seconds depending on the communication media and distance. One way to deal with this is to have an intelligent system which can predict state values for one or more time steps ahead of time. A novel four dimensional scalable multirate cellular neural network (CNN) architecture for use as wide area monitoring system (WAMS) is proposed. Recurrent neural network (RNN) is used as computational engine for each cell as RNNs have dynamic memory. By using information from phasor measurement units (PMUs) that are optimally located in a power system, each layer predicts a state variable for one or more time steps. Data from remote PMUs are replaced by the respective CNN cells' time delayed predicted state values for next time step. This enables local controllers to take real-time control action with system wide information. A 12-bus test power system is used to develop and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CNN framework for WAMS.

IEEE					Reservoir-computing-based, Biologically-inspired Artificial Neural Network for Modeling of a Single Machine Infinite Bus Power System								2012 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS (IJCNN)		IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)												2012	2012	Inspired by living neuron networks (LNNs) in the brain, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been broadly used in various applications as a computational intelligence tool. However, due to many fundamental differences between ANNs and LNNs, despite the mature training mechanisms for ANNs, it is often challenging to use LNNs as a computational intelligence tool. To bridge the gap between ANNs and LNNs, a novel type of artificial neural network, i.e. biologically-inspired artificial neural network (BIANN) is proposed in this paper. The BIANN, which is based on spiking neuron models of LNNs, processes information in a more "brain-like" fashion than conventional ANNs. A reservoir-computing-based training approach is also proposed for BIANNs to serve as a novel modeling and control tool for practical applications. The feasibility of the proposed BIANN is illustrated for the prediction of a synchronous generator's speed and terminal voltage signals in a single machine infinite bus electric power system setup. The proposed BIANN model is able to provide an accurate prediction for online monitoring of a generator.

Natural halogenation processes have been identified for a wide range of natural organic matter, including soils, plant and animal debris, algae, and fungi. Yet, few have considered these organohalogens generated from the ubiquitous bacteria, one of the largest biomass pools on earth. Here, we report and confirm the formation of chloroform (CHCl3) dichloro-acetonitrile (CHCl2CN), chloral hydrate (CCl3CH(OH)(2)) and their brominated analogues by direct halogenation of seven strains of common bacteria and nine cellular monomers. Comparing different major C stocks during litter decomposition stages in terrestrial ecosystems, from plant litter, decomposed litter, to bacteria, we found increasing reactivity for nitrogenous organohalogen yield with decreasing C/N ratio. Our results raise the possibility that natural halogenation of bacteria represents a significant and overlooked contribution to global organohalogen burdens. As bacteria are decomposers that alter the C quality by transforming organic matter pools from high to low C/N ratio and constitute a large organic N pool, the bacterial activity is expected to affect the C, N, and halogen cycling through natural halogenation reactions.									12	0	0	11	0	12			1726-4170			WOS:000310471800001

The Ta/Ta2O5/polymer capacitors exhibited relatively low leakage currents in the range of -50 to 125 V at room temperature. Typical leakage current at 125 V normal polarity (+ on the Ta anode) was less than 2 nA/cm(2) while at -50 V the leakage was less than 1 mu A/cm(2). These low leakage currents over such a large range of applied bias were observed in polymer Ta capacitors for the first time. The leakage current mechanism at inverse bias (- on the Ta anode) was found to be consistent with field-assisted thermal emission, the Poole-Frenkel effect, while the mechanism at normal bias was consistent with ohmic hopping. These results are shown to be essentially due to the potential barrier formed at the interface between the dielectric and the pre-polymerized polymer cathode, which is polarity dependent. Such devices have potential applications as high working voltage Polymer Ta capacitors. (C) 2012 The Electrochemical Society.

J	Xiong, Shuguang; Yu, Lei; Shen, Haiying; Wang, Chen; Lu, Wei			IEEE					Efficient Algorithms for Sensor Deployment and Routing in Sensor Networks for Network-structured Environment Monitoring								2012 PROCEEDINGS IEEE INFOCOM								1008	1016					2012	2012	When monitoring environments with wireless sensor networks, optimal sensor deployment is a fundamental issue and an effective means to achieve desired performance. Selecting best sensor deployment has a dependence on the deployment environments. Existing works address sensor deployment within three types of environments including one dimensional line, 2-D field and 3-D space. However, in many applications the deployment environments usually have network structures, which cannot be simply classified as the three types. The deployed locations and communications of sensor nodes are limited onto the network edges, which make the deployment problem distinct from that in other types of environments. In this paper, we study sensor deployment in network-structured environments and aim to achieve k-coverage while minimizing the number of sensor nodes. Furthermore, we jointly consider the optimization of sink deployment and routing strategies with the goal to minimize the network communication cost of data collection. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first one to tackle sensor/sink deployment under the deployment constraints imposed by the network structure. The hardness of the problems is shown. Polynomial-time algorithms are proposed to determine optimal sensor/sink deployment and routing strategies in tree-topology network structure. Efficient approximation algorithms are proposed for the general graph network structure and their performances are analyzed. Theoretical results and extensive simulations show the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.

J	Li, Ze; Shen, Haiying; Wang, Hailang; Liu, Guoxin; Li, Jin			IEEE					SocialTube: P2P-assisted Video Sharing in Online Social Networks								2012 PROCEEDINGS IEEE INFOCOM								2886	2890					2012	2012	Video sharing has been an increasingly popular application in online social networks (OSNs). However, its sustainable development is severely hindered by the intrinsic limit of the client/server architecture deployed in current OSN video systems, which is not only costly in terms of server bandwidth and storage but also not scalable. The peer-assisted Video-on-Demand (VOD) technique, in which participating peers assist the server in delivering video content has been proposed recently. Unfortunately, videos can only be disseminated through friends in OSNs. Therefore, current VOD works that explore clustering nodes with similar interests or close location for high performance are suboptimal, if not entirely inapplicable, in OSNs. Based on our long-term real-world measurement of over 1,000,000 users and 2,500 videos in Facebook, we propose SocialTube, a novel peer-assisted video sharing system that explores social relationship, interest similarity, and physical location between peers in OSNs. Specifically, SocialTube incorporates three algorithms: a social network (SN)-based P2P overlay construction algorithm, a SN-based chunk prefetch algorithm, and a buffer management algorithm. The trace driven based simulation results show that SocialTube can improve the quality of user experience and system scalability over current P2P VOD techniques.

Due to the iterative nature of design, requirements will evolve and change. Changes in requirements can propagate to other requirements on different subsystems leading to possible increases in the project cost and lead-time. Predicting these requirement changes enables the designers to foresee unanticipated changes and maximises the probability for the project's success. These studies reveal that second-order relationships are influential in predicting requirement change propagation. Unforeseen propagation occurring in first-order form was rare, rather it was occurring in second order. Modelling requirements change exposes these secondary relationships early in the engineering change (EC) definition process, thereby enhancing the decision-making process and augmenting cost estimation. A modelling tool, such as that proposed in this paper, can provide the designer insight into the requirements which may be affected before approving an EC.									23	0	0	0	0	23			0954-4828			WOS:000310312700002

Structure-from-motion techniques are used to capture 3D point cloud models of the object in two different configurations. A novel combination of Procrustes analysis and RANSAC facilitates a straightforward geometric approach to recovering the joint axes, as well as classifying them automatically as either revolute or prismatic. With the resulting articulated model, a robotic system is able to manipulate the object along its joint axes at a specified grasp point in order to exercise its degrees of freedom. Because the models capture all sides of the object, they are occluded-aware, enabling the robotic system to plan paths to parts of the object that are not visible in the current view. Our algorithm does not require prior knowledge of the object, nor does it make any assumptions about the planarity of the object or scene. Experiments with a PUMA 500 robotic arm demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on a variety of objects with both revolute and prismatic joints.

Out of several proposed noise removal schemes, anisotropic diffusion filtering is known to achieve highly precise results. However, the accuracy comes at an expense of high computation cost, especially for large data sets. The highly parallel nature of the aforementioned filtering algorithm makes it a good candidate for the General Purpose Graphical Processing Unit (GPGPU) clusters. In this research, we present a GPGPU cluster-based implementation of the non-linear anisotropic diffusion filter. Our implementation maps the computationally intensive parts of the algorithm to the GPGPU devices while the communication and serial processing are performed by the CPU hosts. Our efficiently mapped multi-node GPGPU implementation is capable of processing images as large as 156 mega-pixels and achieves a speed-up of 29x over an equivalent MPI-only implementation. In addition, our multi-node GPGPU implementation exhibits reasonable scaling behavior that improves with the size of the images.

IEEE					Parallelizing Principal Component Analysis for Robust Facial Recognition using CUDA								2012 SYMPOSIUM ON APPLICATION ACCELERATORS IN HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING (SAAHPC)		Symposium on Application Accelerators in High-Performance Computing						121	124		10.1109/SAAHPC.2012.16			2012	2012	Facial recognition techniques are of interest for tracking and identification in densely populated areas where security is an important concern. Traditional recognition techniques have yielded acceptable results with high repeatability but require special conditions such as a voluntary and stationary subject, close proximity, and appropriate lighting. Because no single algorithm yields robust results under uncontrolled conditions, more than one algorithm must be considered. Three popular template-based algorithms involved in facial recognition include Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) [1] [2] [3]. Since facial recognition algorithms require processor-intensive and complicated matrix calculations, these three algorithms could be improved with hardware that can accelerate these calculations [4]. The PCA algorithm studied in this research is a common mathematical method that has been parallelized for other applications [5], but not for the purposes of facial recognition using General Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs). NVIDIA's CUDA [6] parallel computing architecture is employed to implement the PCA algorithm for the GPGPU device. A C implementation of the PCA algorithm has been optimized specifically for use with CUDA kernels and future parallelization in mind. The results provided in this paper show that the parallel GPGPU implementation outperforms the multithreaded C implementation on a general purpose CPU.

It is recommended that while transition-specific practices are essential in maximizing the potential for success in post-school environments, it is also necessary to ensure that students with E/BD are engaged in school through evidence-based practices in early intervention/prevention, instructional, and behavioral interventions.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0270-4013		978-1-78052-506-8	WOS:000304329900009

J	Johnson, Alan R.								Avoiding Environmental Catastrophes: Varieties of Principled Precaution								ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY				17	3					9	10.5751/ES-04827-170309			2012	2012	The precautionary principle is often proposed as a guide to action in environmental management or risk assessment, and has been incorporated in various legal and regulatory contexts. For many, it reflects the common sense notion of being safe rather than sorry, but it has attracted numerous critics. At times, proponents and critics talk at cross purposes, due to the multiplicity of ways the precautionary principle has been formulated. The approach taken here is to examine four general varieties of precaution, relating each to arguments made in various contexts by others. First, I examine the parallel between the precautionary principle and an argument referred to as Pascal's wager. Critics are right to dismiss versions of the precautionary principle that follow the logic of Pascal's wager, because that argument requires assumption of an infinite catastrophe, which is seldom the case in environmental decisions. Second, I explore precaution viewed as an instance of the phenomenon of ambiguity aversion as described by Daniel Ellsberg. Third, I evaluate precautionary perspectives on our duties to future generations, drawing inspiration from the views of Gifford Pinchot. Fourth, I consider the precautionary principle as an instance of Aldo Leopold's notion of intelligent tinkering. Although controversy persists, I find that a legitimate theoretical foundation exists to implement Ellsbergian, Pinchotian and Leopoldean varieties of precaution in environmental decision making. Additionally, I remark on the role of adaptive management and maintaining resilience in ecological and social systems as an approach to implementing the precautionary principle.									3	0	0	2	0	4			1708-3087			WOS:000309475800007

Koch. Depending on the classification system, the number of apricot species ranges from 3 to 12. Six distinct species are usually recognized: P. brigantina Vill., P. holosericeae Batal, P. armeniaca L., P. mandshurica (Maxim), P. sibirica L., Japanese apricot P. mume (Sieb.) Sieb. & Succ. Vavilov placed apricot in three centers of origin: the Chinese center (Central and Western China), the Central Asiatic center (Afghanistan, northwest India and Pakistan, Kashmir, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Xinjing province in China and western Tien-Shan), and the Near-Eastern center (interior of Asia Minor). Kostina further divided the cultivated apricot according to their adaptability into four major ecogeographical groups: (1) the Central Asian group, (2) the Iran-Caucasian group, (3) the European group, and (4) the Dzhungar-Zailij group. Many local cultivars are grown in the different areas and producing countries; however, these cultivars lack Important traits that needed by modern production and marketing systems. Breeding programs have and continue to develop cultivars with improved adaptability to the environment (temperature requirements, water deficit), extension of the harvest season, fruit quality for fresh consumption and processing, productivity, adequate tree size, and resistance to biotic stresses. The major objectives in apricot breeding programs are resistance to sharka caused by Plum Pox Virus, brown rot caused by Monilinia spp., bacterial diseases caused by Pseudomonas spp. and Xanthomonas arboricola pv. pruni (Smith), Chlorotic Leaf Roll Phytoplasma, and Apricot Decline Syndrome. Among these, PPV is the most limiting factor in Europe and much work has to be invested in developing PPV-resistant apricot cultivars. Molecular markers have been developed in apricot and used mainly for construction of linkage maps and genetic diversity studies.									11	1	0	10	0	12					978-1-4419-0762-2	WOS:000301511500012

This diploid species, Prunus persica, is naturally self-pollinating unlike most of the other cultivated Prunus species. Its center of diversity is in China, where it was domesticated. Starting about 3,000 years ago, the peach was moved from China to all temperate and subtropical climates within the Asian continent and then, more than 2,000 years ago, spread to Persia (present clay Iran) via the Silk Road and from there throughout Europe. From Europe it was taken by the Spanish and Portuguese explorers to the Americas. It has an extensive history of breeding that has resulted in scion cultivars with adaptability from cold temperate to tropical zones, a ripening season extending for 6-8 months, and a wide range of fruit and tree characteristics. Peach has also been crossed with species in the Amygdalus and Prunophora subgenera to produce interspecific rootstocks tolerant to soil and disease problems to which P persica has limited or no resistance. It is the best known temperate fruit species from a genetics perspective and as a model plant has a large array of genomics tools that are beginning to have an impact on the development of new cultivars.									23	0	0	20	2	24					978-1-4419-0762-2	WOS:000301511500014

In Study 1, 28 male and 82 female undergraduate students completed a survey examining their online activities as well as their experiences with cyber bullying. Over 30% of the participants indicated that their first experience with cyber bullying was in college. No gender differences were observed with regard to victimization or perpetration, except with online gaming where males reported a higher rate of victimization than females. With regard to personality differences among victims and perpetrators, victims were lower in agreeableness than non-victims. Study 2 examined the prevalence of cyber bullying among 107 college students at work, as well as the negative outcomes linked to the experience of workplace cyber bullying. Nearly a third of the college student sample reported having been the target of cyber bullying within the past six months. Individuals in jobs in which the Internet is essential and racial minorities reported higher rates of cyber bullying at work. Additionally, cyber bullying was positively linked to several negative emotions, as well as burnout and job search effort. These findings have important implications not only for potential negative outcomes that college students may be facing at school and at work but also for organizational justice issues, as differential treatment at work can lead to lawsuits and other negative work outcomes.									13	0	0	0	0	13			2044-9968		978-1-78052-456-6	WOS:000304329500014

The test statistics are based on observed deviations of transition sample counts between each pair of states in the chain. First, the joint asymptotic normality of these sample counts is established. This result is then used to construct two chi-squared-based tests for reversibility.

The first method we consider is to advance in time one time step by a given method and then to apply an (uncoupled and modular) filter to get the approximation at the new time level. This filter-based stabilization, although algorithmically appealing, is viewed in the literature as introducing far too much numerical dissipation to achieve a quality approximate solution. We show that this is indeed the case. We then consider a modification: Evolve one time step, filter, deconvolve, then relax to get the approximation at the new time step. We give a precise analysis of the numerical diffusion and error in this process and show it has great promise, confirmed in several numerical experiments.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0036-1429	1095-7170		WOS:000310329800007

Most WSAN applications (e.g., fire detection) demand that actuators rapidly respond to events under observation. Therefore, real-time and fault-tolerant transmission is a critical requirement in WSANs to enable sensed data to reach actuators reliably and quickly. Due to limited power resources, energy-efficiency is another crucial requirement. Such requirements become formidably challenging in large-scale WSANs. However, existing WSANs fall short in meeting these requirements. To this end, we first theoretically study the Kautz graph for its applicability in WSANs to meet these requirements. We then propose a Kautz-based REal-time, Fault-tolerant and EneRgy-efficient WSAN (REFER). REFER has a protocol that embeds Kautz graphs into the physical topology of a WSAN for real-time communication and connects the graphs using Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for high scalability. We also theoretically study routing paths in the Kautz graph, based on which we develop an efficient fault-tolerant routing protocol. It enables a relay node to quickly and efficiently identify the next shortest path from itself to the destination only based on node IDs upon routing failure. REFER is advantageous over previous Kautz graph based works in that it does not need an energy-consuming protocol to find the next shortest path and it can maintain the consistency between the overlay and physical topology. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of REFER in comparison with existing systems in terms of real-time communication, energy-efficiency, fault-tolerance and scalability.					32nd IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)32nd IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)	JUN 18-21, 2012JUN 18-21, 2012	IEEE; IEEE Comp Soc; IEEE Comp Soc Tech Comm Distributed Proc; Univ Macau; USA Natl Sci Fdn (NSF); Intel; IBM; Japan Adv Inst Sci & Technol (JAIST)IEEE; IEEE Comp Soc; IEEE Comp Soc Tech Comm Distributed Proc; Univ Macau; USA Natl Sci Fdn (NSF); Intel; IBM; Japan Adv Inst Sci & Technol (JAIST)	Macau, PEOPLES R CHINAMacau, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0			1063-6927		*****************	WOS:000309229600007

The social-based Q&A systems can answer non-factual questions, which cannot be easily resolved by web search engines. These systems either rely on a centralized server for identifying friends based on social information or broadcast a user's questions to all of its friends. Mobile Q&A systems, where mobile nodes access the Q&A systems through Internet, are very promising considering a rapid increase of mobile users and the convenience of practical use. However, such systems cannot directly use the previous centralized methods or broadcasting methods, which generate high cost of mobile Internet access, node overload, and high server bandwidth cost with the tremendous number of mobile users. We propose a distributed Social-based mObile Q&A System (SOS) with low overhead and system cost as well as quick response to question askers. SOS enables mobile users to forward questions to potential answerers in their friend lists in a decentralized manner for a number of hops and then resort to the server. It leverages lightweight knowledge engineering techniques to accurately identify friends who are able to and willing to answer questions, thus reducing the search and computation costs of mobile nodes. The trace-driven simulation results show that SOS can achieve a high query precision and recall rate, a short response latency and low overhead. We have also deployed a pilot version of SOS for use in a small group in Clemson University. The feedback from the users shows that SOS can provide high-quality answers.					32nd IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)32nd IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)	JUN 18-21, 2012JUN 18-21, 2012	IEEE; IEEE Comp Soc; IEEE Comp Soc Tech Comm Distributed Proc; Univ Macau; USA Natl Sci Fdn (NSF); Intel; IBM; Japan Adv Inst Sci & Technol (JAIST)IEEE; IEEE Comp Soc; IEEE Comp Soc Tech Comm Distributed Proc; Univ Macau; USA Natl Sci Fdn (NSF); Intel; IBM; Japan Adv Inst Sci & Technol (JAIST)	Macau, PEOPLES R CHINAMacau, PEOPLES R CHINA	1	0	0	0	0	1			1063-6927		*****************	WOS:000309229600063

Tillage Management for Cotton in Southeastern Coastal Soils during Dry Years								COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS				43	19			2564	2574		10.1080/00103624.2012.711878			2012	2012	With rising energy costs, expensive deep tillage needs to be reevaluated. In 2002 and 2003, tillage treatments were evaluated for effectiveness in increasing cotton yield when noninversion deep tillage was either performed annually or not. Tillage treatments included a nontilled control, a straight-legged subsoil shank with bedding, and strip tillage with each of the following: a straight-legged subsoil shank, a Paratill, and a Terra-Max. In 2003, treatments were split with half the plots tilled and half not. No-tillage treatment significantly reduced penetration resistances better than others. Tillage decreased penetration resistance and improved yield but differences were significant only half the time. Treatments not tilled in the second year did not have significantly reduced penetration resistance because of a lack of recompaction during a dry first growing season. Tilling the second year improved yield marginally. Producers need to decide whether to till after a dry year on a case-by-case basis.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0010-3624			WOS:000309267200011

With current technology of silicon based PV systems, volume manufacturing, appropriate business model and without any subsidy, PV electricity can be generated today at the cost of less than $0.10/Wp. Silicon based PV systems will continue to dominate the PV market. Multi-junction PV systems based on Si and other abundant materials have the potential of manufacturing the next generation of ultra-low cost PV modules. For storing PV electricity there are many directions that have the potential of providing a low-cost solution. Overall, the future of PV electricity generation for rich and poor all over the world is bright.					28th International Conference on Microelectronics (MIEL)28th International Conference on Microelectronics (MIEL)	MAY 13-16, 2012MAY 13-16, 2012	IEEE; IEEE Serbia & Montenegro Sect - ED/SSC Chapter; IEEE Electron Devices Soc (EDS); IEEE Solid-State Circuits Soc (SSCS)IEEE; IEEE Serbia & Montenegro Sect - ED/SSC Chapter; IEEE Electron Devices Soc (EDS); IEEE Solid-State Circuits Soc (SSCS)	Nis, SERBIANis, SERBIA	4	0	0	0	0	4			2159-1660		978-1-4673-0238-8	WOS:000309119600009

In this paper, we present successful GEB techniques for multi-biometric fusion and multi-biometric feature selection and weighting. The first technique, known as GEF (Genetic & Evolutionary Fusion), seeks to optimize weights for score-level fusion. The second technique is known as GEFeWSML (Genetic & Evolutionary Feature Weighting and Selection-Machine Learning). The goal of GEFeWSML is to evolve feature masks (FMs) that achieve high recognition accuracy, use a low percentage of features, and generalize well to unseen subjects. GEFeWSML differs from the other GEB techniques for feature selection and weighting in that it incorporates cross validation in an effort to evolve FMs that generalize well to unseen subjects.

GEFEML was trained on a dataset taken from the FRGC database and generalized well on two test sets of unseen subjects taken from the FRGC and MORPH databases.

Its central theme is that general education teachers can access research informed by ABA in developing prosocial instructional and management practices. Highlighted teaching practices include fostering correct academic responses from students, increasing active student response, and using contingent praise with regularity. The chapter also discusses functional behavioral assessment, positive behavioral interventions and supports, and controversial behavior change issues surrounding seclusion and restraints and medication, topics related to teaching students with or at risk for EBD in general education settings.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0270-4013		978-1-78052-504-4	WOS:000304322000009

The course objectives are to create a collaborative environment for the multi-disciplinary engineering students, provide hands-on experience with mechatronic systems, develop teamwork, leadership, and project management skills, and prepare the students for current industry standards. The holistic course activities include studying fundamental knowledge from mechanical, electrical, computer, industrial, and robotics engineering, which is re-enforced through laboratory experiments and semester long projects. The design projects foster collaborative teamwork activities and offer the opportunity for in-depth experience with sensors, actuators, and material handling systems. The course assessment, which establishes a basis for continuous improvement, considers student performances, their written feedback on qualitative surveys, and feedback offered by an advisory panel composed of industry experts and faculty members. The assessment methods evaluate the performance of students and the course to further improve the overall learning experience. Past evaluation results have shown that the students consistently improved in four learning goals and the advisory panel offered favorable remarks about the course.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0949-149X			WOS:000309387300016

In this work we test the effect of the Voss et al. (2009, 2010) feedback models on homogeneous GMCs, turbulent GMCs, as well as irregularly-structured GMCs. Our simulations also model the enrichment of the ISM with the radioactive trace element Al-26. In all our calculations, a superbubble is formed after break-out from the GMC, and then the massive-star outputs rather rapidly disrupt the molecular cloud. The feedback is most disruptive for a homogeneous molecular cloud, whereas the clouds with an irregular density structure have longer lifetimes, since more of the energy from the feedback is channeled into low density surroundings. We find that for a structured cloud, the stellar feedback naturally reproduces cavities with asymmetric morphologies, similar to the Orion-Eridanus bubble.

The main goal of this study is to investigate 3D virtual learning experiences in the context of tourism. Self-Determination Theory was used to guide this study. Participants were recruited from an introductory tourism course and a tourism marketing class in the Department of Park, Recreation and Tourism Management at a university in southeast region of the United States. The results of this study found that the satisfaction of the psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness are positively related to intrinsic motivation and positive emotions while learning in the virtual worlds. Thus, in order to implement successful virtual-learning courses in the virtual worlds, tourism educators and professionals need to make efforts to foster the satisfaction of psychological needs in the virtual learning environment.					19th International Conference on Information and Communication Technologies in Travel and Tourism (ENTER)19th International Conference on Information and Communication Technologies in Travel and Tourism (ENTER)	JAN 25-27, 2012JAN 25-27, 2012		Helsingborg, SWEDENHelsingborg, SWEDEN	1	0	0	0	0	1					978-3-7091-1141-3	WOS:000308066300020

Assessment of a Chitosan/Hyaluronan Injectable Composite for Fat Reconstruction								JOURNAL OF BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE-POLYMER EDITION				23	18			2303	2320		10.1163/156856211X615274			2012	2012	The long-term success of autologous fat transplants is dependent on numerous factors including tissue quality, tissue survivability and the expansion of the implanted cells. The addition of a biomaterial filler to an injectable gel implant matrix provides an anchor and scaffold for proliferating cells as well as a carrier for syringe delivery. Building on the tissue reconstruction concept which we first disclosed, i.e., an injectable composite comprised of beads in a gel, the present study uses an injectable composite comprised of fatty-acid-loaded chitosan/gelatin (FA-CG) beads (i.e., a degradable filler material with tissue bulking potential) and hyaluronic acid (HA, a matrix). Human and bovine preadipocytes were considered independently; however, in both cases the cells proliferated and differentiated equally when grown with the FA-CG/HA composite, as demonstrated by the production of lipids and triglycerides, as well as expression of the human adipocyte marker aP2. The preadipocyte/FA-CG/HA injectables formed stable complexes that remained intact, with little degradation and no measurable immune response, for 4 months after implantation into mice. These results suggest that FA-CG/HA composite is a suitable injectable matrix for preadipocyte transplantation, providing the basis for further studies investigating the suitability of this technique for larger-scale tissue implantation and regeneration.

Presented are findings that confirm a clear relationship between the elastic modulus, the bulk-to-bound water ratio and the adaptive attachment of attachment dependent cells. We show that biomimetic hydrogels possessing no specific integrin binding motifs but that are of lower elastic modulus and lower bulk-to-bound water ratio, preferentially support cell attachment. Anchorage-dependent human muscle fibroblasts (RMS 13) were cultured on tetraethylene glycol (TEGDA) cross-linked poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)[poly(HEMA)]-based biomimetic hydrogels containing phosphorylcholine (PC) (1 mol%) and dimethylamino amino ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA), a 3 degrees amine (5 mol%), as well as on silicone and agarose controls. Changes in the cross-link density (1 to 12 mol%) of the hydrogel produced a monotonic reduction in the glass transition temperature, T-g (131.8 degrees C at 1 mol% TEGDA to 110.4 degrees C at 12 mol% TEGDA), but an exponential increase in the bulk-to-bound water (4.25 at 1 mol% to 27.04 at 12 mol%) that exactly parallels the increase in elastic modulus as measured by nano-indentation AFM (152 +/- 62 kPa at 1 mol% TEGDA to 1777 +/- 1152 kPa at 12 mol% TEGDA). Enumeration, MTT assay and fluorescence microscopy following 4, 8 and 12 days of culture confirms that short-term cell viability and long term proliferation were favored on low cross-link density, low modulus hydrogels and that cells were preferentially attached to low cross-link density hydrogels. Bound water is central to the adaptive attachment of attachment dependent cells.									28	0	0	9	0	28			0959-9428			WOS:000308099900022

They are widely used for structural imaging of bone, metal implants, and cavities in soft tissue. Recently, a number of new contrast methodologies have emerged which are expanding X-ray's biomedical applications to functional as well as structural imaging. These techniques are promising to dramatically improve our ability to study in situ biochemistry and disease pathology. In this review, we discuss how X-ray absorption, X-ray fluorescence, and X-ray excited optical luminescence can be used for physiological, elemental, and molecular imaging of vasculature, tumors, pharmaceutical distribution, and the surface of implants. Imaging of endogenous elements, exogenous labels, and analytes detected with optical indicators will be discussed.									21	3	0	7	0	24			1463-9076			WOS:000308929300001	22962667

Role of Motif III in Catalysis by Acetyl-CoA Synthetase								ARCHAEA-AN INTERNATIONAL MICROBIOLOGICAL JOURNAL										509579	10.1155/2012/509579			2012	2012	The acyl-adenylate-forming enzyme superfamily, consisting of acyl-and aryl-CoA synthetases, the adenylation domain of the nonribosomal peptide synthetases, and luciferase, has three signature motifs (I-III) and ten conserved coremotifs (A1-A10), some of which overlap the signature motifs. The consensus sequence for signature motif III (core motif A7) in acetyl-CoA synthetase is Y-X-S/T/A-G-D, with an invariant fifth position, highly conserved first and fourth positions, and variable second and third positions. Kinetic studies of enzyme variants revealed that an alteration at any position resulted in a strong decrease in the catalytic rate, although the most deleterious effects were observed when the first or fifth positions were changed. Structural modeling suggests that the highly conserved Tyr in the first position plays a key role in active site architecture through interaction with a highly conserved active-site Gln, and the invariant Asp in the fifth position plays a critical role in ATP binding and catalysis through interaction with the 2'- and 3'-OH groups of the ribose moiety. Interactions between these Asp and ATP are observed in all structures available for members of the superfamily, consistent with a critical role in substrate binding and catalysis for this invariant residue.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1472-3646			WOS:000308500400001

Development of effective interventions for promoting healthy aging is an active but challenging area of research. Mechanistic studies in various model organisms, noticeably two invertebrates, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, have identified many genes and pathways as well as dietary interventions that modulate lifespan and healthspan. These studies have shed light on some of the mechanisms involved in aging processes and provide valuable guidance for developing efficacious aging interventions. Nutraceuticals made from various plants contain a significant amount of phytochemicals with diverse biological activities. Phytochemicals can modulate many signaling pathways that exert numerous health benefits, such as reducing cancer incidence and inflammation, and promoting healthy aging. In this paper, we outline the current progress in aging intervention studies using nutraceuticals from an evolutionary perspective in invertebrate models.									6	0	0	6	0	7			1942-0900			WOS:000308757500001		
J	Tascan, Mevlut; Gaffney, Katharine Lyon								Effect of Glass-Beads on Sound Insulation Properties of Nonwoven Fabrics								JOURNAL OF ENGINEERED FIBERS AND FABRICS				7	1			101	105					2012	2012	Nonwovens are very important sound absorption materials used by the automotive and building industries. One of the most important fabric parameters that affect the sound insulation and absorption properties is the surface area. Higher surface area is often achieved by using low-diameter fibers in the insulation material. This research was done to prove that neither the thickness nor the weight of the material is as important as the total surface area of the fabric. Glass beads with 0.1mm, 0.5mm and 2.5mm sizes, which do not contribute considerably to the total surface area of the fabric, were imbedded into cross-lapped and needlepunched nonwoven structures. These beads were added in weight percentages of 25%, 50%, 75%, 100% and 200%. Sound insulation of glass bead imbedded nonwoven fabrics was tested using Clemson Boston Sound Insulation Tester. It was found that the micro-glass beads did not have a large impact on the sound insulation, as they do not contribute to the surface area of the nonwoven fabric. The samples with 0.1mm beads performed slightly better than samples with larger beads but not enough to make a significant difference. Since surface area is the major parameter that affects sound insulation, simply increasing the weight does not affect the sound insulation property of the material.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1558-9250			WOS:000308220500011

It is found that in n-hexane, the number of arms affects the organization of the miktoarm copolymers: stars with 2 arms (a linear diblock for reference purposes) or 4 arms show aggregation in this selective solvent, whereas no aggregation is observed for stars with 8 and 16 arms in the concentration region studied. This behavior is due to shielding posed by the soluble blocks, which prevents the insoluble blocks from coming together. Interestingly, the contribution from aggregates observed for the two arm star (PS1PI1 diblock) at the highest concentration studied is rather small because the chains predominantly exist as single diblocks in n-hexane. This result may be due to the fact that low molecular weight PS is slightly soluble in linear hydrocarbon solvents. The hydrodynamic sizes found in THF are similar to those in n-hexane for the 2 and 4 arm stars but smaller for the 8 and 16 arms stars. We propose that this is a result of both the limited free space needed for motion of the chains and also because of an increased probability of heterocontacts between the collapsed PS blocks and the swollen PI arms near the star's core.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1744-683X			WOS:000308882800015

Based on the change in the geometry of the contact in the flank worrn face, a theory of indentation of the tool on the workpiece is formulated in such a way that upon applying equations of contact mechanics, a good approximation of the experimental results is obtained.					4th Manufacturing Engineering Society International Conference (MESIC)4th Manufacturing Engineering Society International Conference (MESIC)	SEP 21-23, 2011SEP 21-23, 2011	Mfg Engn Soc; Univ Cadiz; Fac Engn Cadiz; Technol Network Adv Mfg Technol; City Hall CadizMfg Engn Soc; Univ Cadiz; Fac Engn Cadiz; Technol Network Adv Mfg Technol; City Hall Cadiz	Cadiz, SPAINCadiz, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0	0			0094-243X		978-0-7354-1017-6	WOS:000307644700050

Curriculum development was guided by a comprehensive literature review. Process evaluation was used to revise the curriculum and to assess lay educator training and pilot test fidelity. Three hundred sixteen low-income older adults participated in curriculum development and pilot-testing activities. One hundred twenty four participants completed pretest/posttest impact evaluation surveys. The average age of participants was 75 years old with 55.28% having less than high school education. Significant increases in self-efficacy regarding walking most days (p = .0022), using exercise bands (p <. 0001), being physically active to increase strength (p = .0012), being active without injury (p <. 0001), being able to wear appropriate clothing and shoes (p <. 0001), and getting information about community physical activity programs (p = .0007) were observed. Participants also endorsed higher ratings of general health at posttest (p <. 0001).									1	0	0	1	0	1			0360-1277			WOS:000308131400006

Research with anthropomorphic interface agents has shown mixed effects in judgments of preferences but has rarely examined effects on performance. Meanwhile, research in automation has shown some forms of anthropomorphism (e. g. etiquette) have effects on trust and dependence on automation. Participants answered diabetes questions with no-aid, a non-anthropomorphic aid or an anthropomorphised aid. Trust and dependence in the aid was measured. A minimally anthropomorphic aide primarily affected younger adults' trust in the aid. Dependence, however, for both age groups was influenced by the anthropomorphic aid. Automation that deliberately embodies person-like characteristics can influence trust and dependence on reasonably reliable automation. However, further research is necessary to better understand the specific aspects of the aid that affect different age groups. Automation that embodies human-like characteristics may be useful in situations where there is under-utilisation of reasonably reliable aids by enhancing trust and dependence in that aid.Practitioner Summary: The design of decision-support aids on consumer devices (e. g. smartphones) may influence the level of trust that users place in that system and their amount of use. This study is the first step in articulating how the design of aids may influence user's trust and use of such systems									13	0	0	2	0	13			0014-0139			WOS:000308104400007	22799560	
J	Williams, Philicity K.; Soares, Caio V.; Gilbert, Juan E.								A Clustering Rule Based Approach for Classification Problems								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DATA WAREHOUSING AND MINING				8	1			1	23		10.4018/jdwm.2012010101			JAN-MAR 2012	2012	Predictive models, such as rule based classifiers, often have difficulty with incomplete data (e. g., erroneous/missing values). So, this work presents a technique used to reduce the severity of the effects of missing data on the performance of rule base classifiers using divisive data clustering. The Clustering Rule based Approach (CRA) clusters the original training data and builds a separate rule based model on the cluster wise data. The individual models are combined into a larger model and evaluated against test data. The effects of the missing attribute information for ordered and unordered rule sets is evaluated and the collective model (CRA) is experimentally used to show that its performance is less affected than the traditional model when the test data has missing attribute values, thus making it more resilient and robust to missing data.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1548-3924			WOS:000308583500001

Compared to SLN, the incorporation of corn oil gave a higher payload, slower release rate and higher photo-protection for deltamethrin. Particularly, compared to beeswax solid lipid nanoparticles (BSLN), NLC gave a higher payload (approximately 1.79 times) with a high encapsulation efficiency (83.6%), higher photo-protection in direct photolysis (1.8 times) after 12 h exposure of ultraviolet light (UV) and in indirect photolysis (1.37 times) after 2 h exposure of UV in 2% (v/v) acetone solution used as a photosensitizer. This study demonstrated that novel nanocarrier possesses a wide range of applicability in protecting photo-labile compounds for the crop, food and pharmaceutical industries.									11	0	0	7	0	12			0265-2048			WOS:000307999000010	22424134	
J	Grover, Varun								The Information Systems Field: Making a Case for Maturity and Contribution								JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS				13	4	SI		254	272					2012	2012	In this paper, I explore the question of whether the field is progressing well. In doing so, I base my opinion on anchors from four independent studies that I have conducted over the years. These studies treat the field in different ways: as an aggregator of terms, a complex adaptive system, part of a knowledge market, and an evolving biological system. The four perspectives offer different ways of framing the question of progress. I describe these perspectives and make the case based on the conclusions formed from logic and data that the field has indeed progressed splendidly. I argue that the field is maturing and making a contribution, and we should be proud of what we have accomplished. However, through each perspective, I also identify some vicious circles to avoid if we are to continue to progress. The portrait is one of optimism and hope, along with the need for sound stewardship going forward.									9	0	0	1	0	9			1536-9323			WOS:000307845900004		
J	Park, Choon-Sang; Kim, Jae Young; Jung, Eun Young; Tae, Heung-Sik								Numerical Analysis and Experiment on Discharge Characteristics Under Various Address Electrode Widths in AC Plasma Display Panel								MOLECULAR CRYSTALS AND LIQUID CRYSTALS				564		SI		56	66		10.1080/15421406.2012.691682			2012	2012	The address-electrode width is an important parameter to affect both the address and sustain discharge characteristics in an ac-plasma display panels (ac-PDPs). It was numerically founded that as the address-electrode width was wider, the capacitance between the sustain and address electrodes (=C-AY) increased, but the capacitance between the two sustain electrodes (=C-XY) decreased. The resultant changes in the sustain and address discharge characteristics, such as a firing voltage, discharge delay time, and luminance, were examined in the 50 in ac-PDP with a high Xe (>11%) content. The increase in the address-electrode width caused an increase in the firing voltage between the sustain electrodes, which was mainly due to the decrease in the capacitance between two sustain electrodes and the increase in the wall charges accumulation toward the address electrode. In particular, the luminance was observed to increase with an increase in the address-electrode width. As the address-electrode width became broaden, the sustain discharge path was longer toward the address electrode, thereby enlarging the discharge volume. Therefore, it was observed that the IR (VUV) and Ne emissions were increased considerably. Furthermore, these experimental results were confirmed by simulating the electric field strength and Xe ion distribution in discharge cell with respect to the address-electrode width.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1542-1406			WOS:000307934700008		
J	Cho, Byung Rae; Shin, Sangmun								Quality Improvement and Robust Design Methods to a Pharmaceutical Research and Development								MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING										193246	10.1155/2012/193246			2012	2012	Researchers often identify robust design, based on the concept of building quality into products or processes, as one of the most important systems engineering design concepts for quality improvement and process optimization. Traditional robust design principles have often been applied to situations in which the quality characteristics of interest are typically time-insensitive. In pharmaceutical manufacturing processes, time-oriented quality characteristics, such as the degradation of a drug, are often of interest. As a result, current robust design models for quality improvement which have been studied in the literature may not be effective in finding robust design solutions. In this paper, we show how the robust design concepts can be applied to the pharmaceutical production research and development by proposing experimental and optimization models which should be able to handle the time-oriented characteristics. This is perhaps the first attempt in the robust design field. An example is given, and comparative studies are discussed for model verification.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1024-123X			WOS:000307651900001

Scheduling parity checks for increased throughput in early-termination, layered decoding of QC-LDPC codes on a stream processor								EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING										141	10.1186/1687-1499-2012-141			2012	2012	A stream processor is a power-efficient, high-level-language programmable option for embedded applications that are computation intensive and admit high levels of data parallelism. Many signal-processing algorithms for communications are well matched to stream-processor architectures, including partially parallel implementations of layered decoding algorithms such as the turbo-decoding message-passing (TDMP) algorithm. Communication among clusters of functional units in the stream processor impose a latency cost during both the message-passing phase and the parity-check phase of the TDMP algorithm with early termination; the inter-cluster communications latency is a significant factor in limiting the throughput of the decoder. We consider two modifications of the schedule for the TDMP algorithm with early termination; each halves the communication required between functional-unit clusters of the stream processor in each iteration. We show that these can provide a substantial increase in the information throughput of the decoder without increasing the probability of error.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1687-1499			WOS:000307248000001		
J	Xiao, Feipeng; Zhao, Wenbin; Gandhi, Tejash; Amirkhanian, Serji N.								Laboratory investigation of moisture susceptibility of long-term saturated warm mix asphalt mixtures								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PAVEMENT ENGINEERING				13	5			401	414		10.1080/10298436.2011.585649			2012	2012	Moisture damage in flexible pavements might cause stripping in asphalt pavements and ultimately result in premature failure. Warm mix asphalt (WMA) technology as a means to decrease the energy consumption and emissions associated with conventional hot mix asphalt production is broadly being used recently. However, the utilisation of the hydrated lime and liquid anti-strip additives in WMA mixtures makes these issues more complicated. The objective of this study was to investigate and evaluate the moisture susceptibility of mixtures containing anti-stripping agents (ASAs) and WMA additives after long-term saturated durations. The experimental design for this study included the utilisations of one binder source (PG 64-22), three ASA additives and control, two WMA additives and hot mix, and three aggregate sources. A total of 36 types of mixtures and 540 specimens were fabricated and tested in this study. The performed properties included indirect tensile strength (ITS), tensile strength ratio, flow and toughness. The results indicated that the aggregate source has an effect on dry ITS and flow values but had no effect on wet ITS, wet flow and toughness values. In addition, hot mixture generally had higher dry and wet ITS values, and there were significant differences in flow and toughness values between hot and warm mixtures. Moreover, the hydrated lime exhibited the best moisture resistance in WMA mixtures; the liquid ASA additives could increase the ITS values of mixtures but exhibited a weak moisture resistance in this study. Furthermore, the storage and saturated duration generally had no effect on ITS values, and statistical analysis results did not show any differences among these mixtures.									7	0	0	0	1	7			1029-8436			WOS:000307191600003

In this paper, under some minor conditions on., we first construct an incoherent Eisenstein series (in the sense of Kudla) associated to (K, -kappa N). Then we study its derivative at the center of symmetry s = 0, and show that each non-constant Fourier coefficient of the derivative can be interpreted as the degree of certain zero-dimensional schemes. This result together with our previous work gives a complete answer to a question raised by Kudla-Rapoport-Yang.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1073-2780			WOS:000307496900002

We provide analysis that suggests for such problems, obtaining accurate solutions necessitates either the use of pointwise divergence-free finite elements (such as Scott-Vogelius), or heavy grad-div stabilization of weakly divergence-free elements. The theory is demonstrated in numerical experiments for a benchmark natural convection problem, where large irrotational forcing occurs with high Rayleigh numbers. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Carbon nanomaterials with their high thermal conductivities have been widely pursued for such a purpose. Specifically, carbon nanotubes have been shown both theoretically and experimentally to possess extraordinarily high thermal conductivities at the individual nanotube level, and thus are logically considered as ideal fillers for highly thermally conductive polymeric nanocomposites. However, the predicted dramatically enhanced thermal transport in polymers upon the incorporation of carbon nanotubes has not yet materialized. Recently, graphene research has brought new opportunities to the development of polymer/carbon nanocomposites of high thermal conductivities, with already some successful uses of exfoliated graphite sheets as nanoscale fillers. In this work poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) was selected as the polymer matrix for the dispersion of single-walled carbon nanotubes (seamlessly with PVA functionalization and solubilization) vs. few-layer graphene sheets as nanoscale carbon fillers for a more direct comparison on the thermal transport performance in the resulting nanocomposites. The effect of aligning the nanotubes embedded in the nanocomposite films via mechanical stretching was also evaluated. Implications of the comparison between the nanotubes and nanosheets with respect to their potentials in thermally conductive polymeric nanocomposites are discussed.									28	3	0	1	0	28			0959-9428			WOS:000306972900062

Joshi, R; Muller, P; Podelski, A		The Location Linking Concept: A Basis for Verification of Code Using Pointers								VERIFIED SOFTWARE: THEORIES, TOOLS, EXPERIMENTS		Lecture Notes in Computer Science		7152				34	+					2012	2012	While the use of pointers can be minimized by language mechanisms for data abstraction, alias avoidance and control, and disciplined software development techniques, ultimately, any verifying compiler effort must be able to verify code that makes use of them. Additionally, in order to scale, the verification machinery of such a compiler must use specifications to reason about components. This paper follows a natural question that arises from combining these ideas: can the general machinery of specification-based component verification also be used to verify code that uses instances of types that are more traditionally built-in, such as arrays and pointers? This paper answers the question in the affirmative by presenting a Location_Linking_Template, a concept that captures pointer behavior, and uses it to verify the code of a simple data abstraction realized using pointers. In this deployment, pointers have a specification like any other component. We also note that the concept can be extended and realized so that different systems can plug in alternative implementations to give programmers the flexibility to choose, e.g., manual memory management or automatic garbage collection depending on their performance concerns.					4th International Conference on Verified Software: Theories, Tool and Experiments (VSTTE 2012)4th International Conference on Verified Software: Theories, Tool and Experiments (VSTTE 2012)	JAN 28-29, 2012JAN 28-29, 2012		Philadelphia, PAPhiladelphia, PA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0302-9743		978-3-642-27704-7	WOS:000306943500004

The molecular and micro-structure of the bulk glass and the n-propylamine solution, as well as the spin-coated thin films and post-irradiated films are analyzed by Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. We find the vibrational spectral fingerprint of Ge4S104--units in the amine solutions as well as in the spin-coated films, indicating a similar molecular structure of solutions and solution-processed films, which differs from the bulk glass. Moreover, the spin-coated films exhibit nanopores, and change their composition during irradiation such that sulfur escapes from the film while oxygen gets absorbed.									11	0	0	0	1	11			0959-9428			WOS:000307305700065

The star graph Sn is a (n - 1)-regular graph with n! nodes and n!(n - 1)/2 edges. Recursive hierarchical structure is one of the most attractive and well known properties of star graphs. A dimension n star graph can be divided into n substars of dimension n - 1 by grouping the nodes with the same symbol at the ith position together, 2 <= i <= n [see Figure 1].In this paper, we propose a new recursive hierarchical structure of star graphs. The objective is to redesign shortest routing in star graphs in the light of this new structure and design new efficient algorithms for shortest path multicast algorithms [2] adaptibe to bandwidth and latency requirements.					8th International Conference on Distributed Computing and Internet Technologies (ICDCIT 2012)8th International Conference on Distributed Computing and Internet Technologies (ICDCIT 2012)	FEB 02-04, 2012FEB 02-04, 2012		KIIT Univ, Bhubaneswar, INDIAKIIT Univ, Bhubaneswar, INDIA	2	0	0	0	0	2			0302-9743		978-3-642-28072-6	WOS:000306615100029

Based on real-world applications of whole-systems design, the Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) is developing educational case studies to help engineers expand their whole-systems thinking. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of these case studies in multiple sections of a first-year engineering course.Design/methodology/approach - The comprehension of whole-systems principles by 165 first-year engineering students at Clemson University was evaluated through surveys and open-ended questionnaires, before and after introducing the educational case studies.Findings - The pilot study results show that introducing the case studies improves students' consideration of several essential whole-systems design concepts. The case studies were particularly effective in strengthening student consideration of the clean sheet approach, integrative design, design for multiple benefits, optimization of the entire system, and the possibility of drastic efficiency increases with current technology.Research limitations/implications - This study was conducted at a single institution and with a fairly homogeneous group of students. These factors should be considered when interpreting the implications of the findings for other groups.Originality/value - This preliminary research shows that case study examples like these can help increase consideration of the whole-systems design approach that leads to improved sustainability performance.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1467-6370			WOS:000306672900007

Development and validation of the implicit information from Lewis structures instrument (IILSI): do students connect structures with properties?								CHEMISTRY EDUCATION RESEARCH AND PRACTICE				13	3			195	200		10.1039/c2rp00010e			2012	2012	Lewis structures are a simplified two dimensional "cartoon" of molecular structure that allow a knowledgeable user to predict the types of properties a particular substance may exhibit. However, prior research shows that many students fail to recognize these structure-property connections and are unable to decode the information contained in the structures, thus resulting in students' inability to use Lewis structures for their intended purposes. We have developed a survey instrument using responses from student interviews and open-ended questions from a previous research study to determine students' beliefs about the information that can be obtained from Lewis structures. The survey was found to be reliable and valid through multiple administrations to a total of 3203 students, including first-and second-semester general chemistry and organic chemistry students, junior/senior level undergraduate chemistry students, and graduate level chemistry students. We propose that this survey can be a useful informational tool for instructors for a wide range of courses where students' understanding of structure-function relationships is important.									31	0	0	0	0	31			1109-4028			WOS:000306121100006

That study addressed the material definitions for the molding glass, L-BAL35, computational convergence, and how the final deviation of the lens shape from the mold shape is achieved for both a bi-convex lens and a steep meniscus lens. In the current study, after validating the computational approach for both lens types, an extensive sensitivity analysis is performed to quantify the importance of several material and process parameters that affect deviation for both lens shapes. Such a computational mechanics approach has the potential to replace the current trial-and-error, iterative process of mold profile design to produce glass optics of required geometry, provided all the input parameters are known to sufficient accuracy. Some of the critical contributors to deviation include structural relaxation of the glass, thermal expansion of the molds, TRS and viscoelastic behavior of the glass and friction between glass and mold. The results indicate, for example, the degree of accuracy to which key material properties should be determined to support such modeling. In addition to providing extensive sensitivity results, this computational model also helps lens molders/machine designers to understand the evolution of lens profile deviation for different lens shapes during the course of the process.									11	0	0	0	0	11			0149-5739			WOS:000306084600003

We describe experiments that have produced high average power green output power at 515 nm as well as preliminary experiments producing UV output power at 257.25 nm. Frequency doubling experiments used a 20 mm long non-critically phase-matched LBO crystal mounted in a constant temperature oven. A mode-locked Yb fiber laser operating at 50 MHz was used to drive a two Yb: YAG cryogenic amplifier system, producing hundreds of watts of average power output with a FWHM pulsewidth of 12 ps. Doubling efficiencies of > 50 % have been observed. For frequency quadrupling, we have used hydrothermally grown KBBF crystals grown at Clemson University and Advanced Photonic Crystals. KBBF offers unprecedented UV transmission down to 155 nm, and was used in a Type I phase-matching configuration. The properties of KBBF will be discussed, as well as the experimental results observed and conversion efficiency.

High quality epitaxial layers of functionalized layers can be grown using Y2O3 doped with the desired ion and Al2O3 as feedstocks in water between 600-650 degrees C at 1 kbar pressure, with a mineralizer of 1-4M K2CO3. The epitaxial layers are doped with a variety of doping ions that enable a number of optical functionalities. These include undoped regions to serve as endcaps, Q-switching regions, ASE suppression cladding layers, waveguide layers and a number of other applications. Different layers can be grown sequentially on the same crystal to create multifunctional single crystals. Epitaxial layers have been grown on both {111} and {100} faces with rates of growth being {100}>{111}>{110}. Growth rates range typically from 25 to 100 microns per day but faster and slower rates have been observed. The technique is not restricted to YAG and can be extended to any oxide hosts that can be grown hydrothermally. Work is being extended to LuAG, YVO4 and M2O3 (M = Lu, Sc). The techniques presented here can address long-standing performance issues associated with solid-state laser materials; when combined with crystal joining technologies, new crystal functionalities emerge that can further improve solid-state laser performance; we refer to this new generation of laser crystals as "smart".

In many of these lasers, fiber nonlinearities are the main limits to further scaling. Although numerous specific techniques have studied for the suppression of the wide range of nonlinearities, the fundamental solution is scaling mode areas in fibers while maintaining sufficient single mode operation. Here the key problem is that more modes are supported once physical dimensions of waveguides are increased. There are two basic approaches, lower refractive index contrast to counter the increase of waveguide dimension or/and introduction of additional losses to suppress higher order modes. Lower index contrast leads to weak waveguides, resulting in fibers no longer being coil-able. Our research has been focused on designs for significant higher mode suppression. In conventional waveguides, modes are increasingly guided in the center of the waveguides when waveguide dimensions are increased. It is hard to couple the modes out to suppress them. This severely limits the scalability of all designs based conventional fibers. In an all-solid photonic bandgap fiber, modes are guided due to anti-resonance of cladding photonic crystal lattice. This leads strongly mode-dependent guidance. Our theoretical study has shown that it can have some of the highest differential mode losses among all designs with equivalent mode areas. Our design and experimental works have shown the potential of this approach for all-glass fibers with >50 mu m core which can be coiled for high power applications.

This specialised technique is often capable of growing crystals at temperatures well below their melting points and thus potentially offers routes to new phases or the growth of bulk crystals with less thermal strain. Even some of the most recalcitrant materials can be dissolved, undergo chemistry and be grown as single crystals using hydrothermal solutions. This work reviews the field of bulk hydrothermal crystal growth, highlighting important advances of the past 25 years.									12	0	0	0	0	12			1478-6435			WOS:000306119500019

Despite considerable efforts in developing the curve-fitting protocol to evaluate the crystallinity index (CI), in its present state, XRD measurement can only provide a qualitative or semi-quantitative assessment of the amounts of crystalline and amorphous cellulosic components in a sample. The greatest barrier to establish quantitative XRD is the lack of appropriate cellulose standards needed to calibrate the measurements. In practice, samples with known CIs are very difficult to be prepared or determined. As an approach, we might assign the samples with reported CIs from FT-IR procedure, in which the three-band ratios were first calculated and then were converted into CIs within a large and diversified pool of cotton fibers. This study reports the development of simple XRD algorithm, over time-consuming and subjective curve-fitting process, for direct determination of cotton cellulose CI by correlating XRD with the FT-IR CI references.

Mechanical vibrations change the orientational order of the magnetic dipoles in the ferrofluid and create a varying magnetic flux which induces an electromotive force in a coil wound around the tank, thereby generating an electric current according to Faraday's law. Several experiments are performed on a cylindrical container of volume 5x10(-5) m(3) carrying a ferrofluid and subjected to different base excitation levels. Initial results illustrate that the proposed device can be excited at one or multiple modal frequencies depending on the container's size, can exhibit tunable characteristics by adjusting the external magnetic field, and currently produces 28 mV of open-circuit voltage using a base excitation of 2.5 m/s(2) at a frequency of 5.5 Hz.

Excessive battery operation is moderated by adjusting the allowable battery power limits through the feedback of information on the electrode-averaged lithium-ion concentration estimated by the extended Kalman filter. Uneven discretization of the radii of the solid electrode particles is used in the extended Kalman filter to reduce the computation effort. Safe battery operation with a relatively small size of the battery is possible with the proposed battery power management strategy by preventing extreme conditions, thus providing more flexibility for the development of robust and cost-effective hybrid electric vehicles.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0954-4070			WOS:000305562200001

Previous work has shown that the semi-classical quantum Fourier transform (SCQFT) can use these individual coefficients to perform the QFT using only single-quantum bit (qubit) unitary gates and measurement operators. However, the SCQFT requires these individual decomposed qubits of the quantum system as input to the algorithm. We devise two methods to find separable approximations of quantum systems to serve as inputs to the SCQFT. We introduce an application of the approach on classical radio frequency signals represented through a quantum model. The resulting decomposition and QFT are computed on several simulated results, and an example is given using an experimental signal.

The Tm: fiber laser oscillator consists of a LMA fiber with 25/400 mu m core/cladding diameters pumped by 793 nm diode. The output beam was collimated to a 3 mm beam diameter, and transmitted through the chalcogenide samples at CW powers up to 23 W. We measure the transmission as a function of incident power, as well as some initial characterization of surface damage from nanosecond pulses at 2 mu m. Furthermore, we utilize a wavefront sensor to characterized the thermal lens induced by the Tm: fiber laser.

In the mixed alcohol transesterifications, formation of methyl esters was favored over ethyl and butyl esters. The influence of ester head group on fuel properties was determined. Specifically, cold flow properties, lubricity, and energy content improved in the order: CSO butyl esters (CSBE, best) > ethyl esters (CSEE) > methyl esters (CSME). Higher kinematic viscosities (KVs) as well as lower iodine values (IVs) and wear scars were observed with larger ester head groups. Blends of CSME, CSEE and CSBE exhibited properties intermediate to the neat esters. All ester samples were within the limits prescribed in ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 for cetane number, acid value (AV), glycerol (free and total) content, sulfur, and phosphorous. Also examined was the influence of blending alkyl esters with petrodiesel. All blends exhibited improved cold flow properties versus unblended alkyl esters. Enhanced lubricity was observed after blending. With increasing content of biodiesel, higher KVs and lower energy contents were observed. Finally, all blends were within the limits specified in ASTM D975 and D7467 for AV, KV and sulfur.									4	2	0	1	1	6			0003-021X			WOS:000305289900016

An irradiation geometry consisting of a monoenergetic x-ray source (40 to 80 keV), a 20x20x20 cm(3) water cube and an image plane was modeled using MCNP5. At the center of the water cube was a 2x0.001x20 cm(3) rectangular prism filled with iodine for imaging contrast. Contrast, noise, and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were obtained for imaging under three scenarios: 1) with perfect grids; 2) with 8: 1 grids (10% scatter, 70% primary beam) and 3) without grids at different incident photon energies. Under the same amount of incident photons, doubling photon energy from 40 to 80 keV caused a 19% increase in the total energy imparted and a 24% decrease in skin dose, with the lowest skin dose reached at similar to 70 keV. When the CNR was kept constant, the minimum energy imparted was achieved at 40 keV, while the minimum skin dose was achieved around 40 similar to 50 keV. When increasing the incident photon energy from 40 to 80 keV under a fixed CNR, skin dose increased similar to 480% and total energy imparted increased similar to 750% on average. Comparing with the imaging process without grids, the utilization of 8: 1 grids decreased doses by similar to 84% at a fixed CNR. Under a constant image quality, the lowest skin dose and energy imparted may be achieved at different energy levels.

A simulation geometry in which an inner sphere (d = 0.2 cm, 1 cm, 5 cm) filled with iodinated contrast medium (or water) is located at the center of a 20 cm diameter water sphere was used in simulations performed with MCNP5 codes. Monoenergetic x-rays with energies ranging from 40 to 80 keV from a cone beam source were utilized and the contrast medium concentration ranged from 100 to 1mg/ml. Absorbed dose ratio (R-D) to inner sphere and total absorbed energies ratio (R-E) to the whole phantom with and without iodinated contrast medium were investigated. The maximum R-D was similar to 13 for the 0.2cm diameter sphere with 100mg/ml contrast medium. The maximum R-E was similar to 1.05 for the 5cm diameter contrast sphere at 80keV with 100mg/ml contrast medium. Under the same incident photon energy, increasing the inner sphere size from 0.2cm to 5cm caused a similar to 63% increase in the R-D on average. Decreasing the contrast medium concentration from 100 to 10 mg/ml caused a decrease of R-D of similar to 76%. A conclusion was reached that although local absorbed dose increase caused by iodinated contrast agent could be high, the increase in total absorbed energy was negligible.

Control-oriented model-based ignition timing prediction for high-degrees-of-freedom spark ignition engines								PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART D-JOURNAL OF AUTOMOBILE ENGINEERING				226	D6			828	839		10.1177/0954407011430178			2012	2012	The pressure to improve automotive fuel economy and emissions has driven the introduction of more complex spark ignition engines. As the number of control actuators increases, traditional ignition timing calibration and control methods become restrictive, creating a need for new feedforward approaches to manage transient operation. This research was conducted to determine whether a control-oriented turbulent flame entrainment model could be developed to predict the ignition timing of an engine with a large number of control actuators. A physics-based approach is used to capture the influence of additional control actuators on the complex interactions affecting the ignition timing. Each actuator is characterized by its influence on the fundamental combustion parameters, such as the residual gas fraction and the turbulence intensity. Experimental results are used to generate semiempirical input and combustion models that are capable of running in real time within an engine controller. The model is used to predict the combustion duration, from the spark to 50% mass fraction burned, at every crank angle position within a reasonable ignition timing window for each engine operating point. With minimal engine mapping, the model was capable of predicting the spark timing to within several degrees of ideal values, demonstrating the feasibility of this approach for use in high-degrees-of-freedom spark ignition engines.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0954-4070			WOS:000305561700009

The VR treadmill is a non-motorized treadmill outfitted with automatic controls so that its incline can be adjusted according to the terrain elevation data, and the head tracked imagery of a panoramic environment (Google Streetview) can be displayed on a commercial head mounted display (HMD) and updated as the person walks on the treadmill. This implementation of VR devices is an interdisciplinary effort requiring the cooperation of mechanical, electrical and computer science researchers. The system is decomposed into three subsystems: the mechanisms, the control devices and the VR components, with the approach to solve the problem described. This paper discusses the motivation for building such a prototype. Further, the limitations of the design are exposed and future research directions are presented.					5th International Conference on Advanced Research and Rapid Prototyping5th International Conference on Advanced Research and Rapid Prototyping	SEP 28-OCT 01, 2011SEP 28-OCT 01, 2011	Ctr Rapid & Sustainable Prod Dev; Portuguese Fdn Sci & Technol; Global Alliance Rapid Prototyp AssocCtr Rapid & Sustainable Prod Dev; Portuguese Fdn Sci & Technol; Global Alliance Rapid Prototyp Assoc	Polytechn Inst Leiria, Sch Technol & Management, Leiria, PORTUGALPolytechn Inst Leiria, Sch Technol & Management, Leiria, PORTUGAL	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-203-18141-6	WOS:000305445600103

In cardiology, the use of fluoroscopy for the placement of catheters within the heart has become the standard of care. While fluoroscopy provides a live video sequence with the current location, it poses risks the patient and clinician through exposure to radiation. Radiation dose is cumulative and thus children are at even greater risk from exposure. To reduce the use of radiation, and improve surgical technique we have begun development of an image-guided navigation system, which can deliver therapeutic devices via catheter. In this work we have demonstrated the intrinsic properties of our imaging system, which have led to the development of a phantom emulating a childs heart with an ASD. Further investigation into the use of this information, in a series of mock clinical experiments, will be performed to design procedures for inserting devices into the heart while minimizing fluoroscopy use.

Many exact solvers for MINLP are branch-and-bound algorithms that compute a lower bound on the optimal solution using a linear programming relaxation of the original problem.In order to solve these problems to optimality, disjunctions can be used to partition the solution set or to obtain strong lower bounds on the optimal solution of the problem. In the MINLP context, the use of disjunctions for branching has been subject to intense research, while the practical utility of disjunctions as a means of generating valid linear inequalities has attracted some attention only recently.We describe an application to MINLP of a well-known separation method for disjunctive cuts that has shown to be very effective in Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). As the experimental results show, this application obtains encouraging results in the MINLP case even when a simple separation method is used.									3	0	0	0	0	3					978-1-4614-1926-6	WOS:000303483300005

Orders are received by a manufacturer, processed on a single production line, and delivered to customers by capacitated vehicles. Each order (job) is associated with a customer, weight (priority), processing time, due time, and size (volume or storage space required in the transportation unit). A mathematical model is presented in which a number of weighted linear combinations of the objectives are used to aggregate both objectives into a single objective. Because even the single objective problem is NP-hard, different heuristics based on a genetic algorithm (GA) are developed to further approximate a Pareto-optimal set of solutions for our multi-objective problem.									16	0	0	0	0	16			0020-7543			WOS:000304824400005

Changes in Visitors' Environmental Focus during an Appreciative Recreation Experience								JOURNAL OF LEISURE RESEARCH				44	2			179	200					2012	2012	Recreation that involves learning about nature, or viewing, observing, studying, identifying, or photographing nature may be termed appreciative recreation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the on-site phase of an appreciative recreation experience and, specifically, to identify how time spent in a nature-based environment influences the environmental focus of participants. The researchers collected data from visitors (adjusted N = 158) at Congaree National Park using a version of the Experiential Sampling Method. Data analysis consisted of a Confirmatory Factor Analysis and Multi-Level Modeling. The researchers concluded that time spent at the park does have a significant influence on an appreciative recreation experience and that there are three phases of the experience: preparation, immersion, and separation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-2216			WOS:000304893200003

X-ray luminescence tomography (XLT) maps the location of these radioluminescent contrast agents at high resolution by scanning a narrow X-ray beam through the tissue sample and collecting the luminescence at every position. Adding magnetic functionality to these radioluminescent particles would enable them to be guided, oriented, and heated using external magnetic fields, while their location and spectrum could be imaged with XLT and complementary magnetic resonance imaging. In this work, multifunctional monodispersed magnetic radioluminescent nanoparticles were developed as potential drug delivery carriers and radioluminescence imaging agents. The particles consisted of a spindle-shaped magnetic gamma-Fe2O3 core and a radioluminescent europium-doped gadolinium oxide shell. Particles with solid iron oxide cores displayed saturation magnetizations consistent with their similar to 13% core volume, however, the iron oxide quenched their luminescence. In order to increase the luminescence, we partially etched the iron oxide core in oxalic acid while preserving the radioluminescent shell. The core size was controlled by the etching time which in turn affected the particles' luminescence and magnetic properties. Particles with intermediate core sizes displayed both strong magnetophoresis and luminescence properties. They also served as MRI contrast agents with relaxivities of up to 58 mM(-1) s(-1) (r(2)) and 120 mM(-1) s(-1) (r(2)*). These particles offer promising multimodal MRI/fluorescence/X-ray luminescence contrast agents. Our core-shell synthesis technique offers a flexible method to control particle size, shape, and composition for a wide range of biological applications of magnetic/luminescent nanoparticles.									31	0	0	2	0	31			0959-9428			WOS:000304884000055	24520183

Varying the synthesis conditions provides control of particle size, size-distribution, and kinetics of particle formation. Infrared spectroscopy, energy dispersive X-ray chemical analysis, and high-performance liquid chromatography indicated that allicin and other carbohydrates in the garlic extract are the primary nanoparticle stabilizing moieties. The synthesized silver nanoparticles also demonstrate potential for biomedical applications, owing to (1) enhanced stability in biological media, (2) resistance to oxidation by the addition of H2O2, (3) ease and scalability of synthesis, and (4) lack of harsh chemicals required for synthesis. Cytotoxicity assays indicated no decrease in cellular proliferation for vascular smooth muscle cells and 3T3 fibroblasts at a concentration of 25 mu g/mL, confirming that silver nanoparticles synthesized with garlic extract are potential candidates for future experimentation and implementation in the biomedical field.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1687-4110	1687-4129		WOS:000305026100001

Corn fiber is a good cellulosic feedstock to produce second-generation biofuel. A biorefinery concept is introduced to convert fibrous residue, corn fiber, into fermentable sugars at a lower temperature with minimal use of chemicals. Laboratory-scale consolidated fermentation system comprised of on-site fungal enzyme production system and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) yielded 7.1, 8.6 and 4.1 g ethanol per 100 g corn fiber when saccharified with the white-, brown-, and soft-rot fungi, respectively. The highest corn-to-ethanol yield (8.6 g ethanol/100 g corn fiber) was equivalent to 42% of the theoretical ethanol yield from starch and cellulose in corn fiber. This is equivalent to 120 1 of ethanol per metric ton of corn fiber. With process optimization, conversion of over 70% of corn fiber carbohydrate content into ethanol can generate as much as 13x10(9) 1 of ethanol per year, which is equivalent to 25% of the current annual ethanol production (52x10(9) I) in the US, additional $8.65 billion annual revenue and reduction in corn acreage by 3 mha. It is also possible to convert the carbohydrates to a fuel oil using a secondary oleaginous fungal process. The residual fiber enriched with fungal protein can still be utilized as animal feed without unbalancing the feed market/supply.									3	0	0	2	0	3			1865-3529		978-1-4471-2323-1	WOS:000303026400005

Both types of SOT couplings are considered linear in the electron momentum. Our results are obtained within a formalism based on the equation of motion satisfied by the density operator which is solved numerically for different values of the angle 0, the angle determining the polarization direction of the laser pulse. Solutions thus obtained are later employed in determining the time-dependent charge and spin currents, whose values are calculated in the stationary limit. Both these currents exhibit an oscillatory behavior complicated in the case of the spin current by a beating pattern. We explain this occurrence on account of the two spin-orbit interactions which force the electron spin to oscillate between the two spin quantization axes corresponding to Rashba and Dresselhaus interactions. The oscillation frequencies are explained using the single particle spectrum.

A spatio-temporal multi-compartment pharmacokinetic model simulated intravascular release of doxorubicin from TSL, its transport into interstitium, and cell uptake. Two heating schedules were simulated, each lasting 30 min: 1) hyperthermia at 43 degrees C (HT) and 2) hyperthermia followed by a high temperature (50 degrees C for 20 s) pulse (HT+). As preliminary model validation, in vivo studies were performed in thigh muscle of a New Zealand White rabbit, where local hyperthermia with a clinical magnetic resonance-guided HIFU system was applied following TSL administration.Results: HT produced a defined region of high doxorubicin concentration (cellular concentration similar to 15-23 mu g/g) in the target region. Cellular drug uptake was directly related to HT duration, with increasing doxorubicin uptake up to similar to 2h. HT+ enhanced drug delivery by similar to 40% compared to HT alone. Temperature difference between model and experiment within the hyperthermia zone was on average 0.54 degrees C. Doxorubicin concentration profile agreed qualitatively with in vivo fluorescence profile.Conclusions: Computational models can predict temperature and delivered drug from combination of HIFU with TSL. Drug delivery using TSL may be enhanced by prolonged hyperthermia up to 2 h or by local cessation of vascular perfusion with a high temperature pulse following hyperthermia.									47	3	0	35	0	51			0265-6736			WOS:000304352400007	22621735

The aim of the models was the prediction of the deviation of the final lens profile from that of the mold, which was accomplished to within one-half of a micron. The molding glass was modeled as viscoelastic in shear and volume using an n-term, prony series; temperature dependence of the material behavior was taken into account using the assumption of thermal rheological simplicity (TRS); structural relaxation as described by the Tool-Narayanaswamy-Moynihan (TNM)-model was used to account for temperature history dependent expansion and contraction, and the molds were modeled as elastic taking into account both mechanical and thermal strain. In Part I of this two-part series, the computational approach and material definitions are presented. Furthermore, in preparation for the sensitivity analysis presented in Part II, this study includes both a bi-convex lens and a steep meniscus lens, which reveals a fundamental difference in how the deviation evolves for these different lens geometries. This study, therefore, motivates the inclusion of both lens types in the validations and sensitivity analysis of Part II. It is shown that the deviation of the steep meniscus lens is more sensitive to the mechanical behavior of the glass, due to the strain response of the newly formed lens that occurs when the pressing force is removed.									14	0	0	0	0	14			0149-5739			WOS:000304482500005

To this end, designers often rely on past experience to decide which model to construct; yet students without this experience have no help. Interestingly there are noticeable gaps in the research literature with respect to how and when to select representations for engineering design. This paper examines the differences between three types of engineering representations, specifically sketches, drawing packages, and physical prototypes. The amount of information designers can extract, in addition to the correctness and confidence, from these representations is studied. Design reviews of concepts with respect to requirements verification serves as the design task of this investigation. The data from this user study are analysed, using descriptive and non-parametric statistics. The results reveal that designers are more confident and correct in making conclusions about whether a design meets requirements when using high-fidelity representations and physical representations, specifically high-fidelity prototypes. Low-fidelity representations appear to be useful for determining if a design meets functional requirements, but not geometric or manufacturing requirements. The relationship between drawing packages and low-fidelity prototypes is still unclear and thus is an area for further research.									15	0	0	0	0	15			0954-4828			WOS:000304063500002

Though the crystallinity of the seed layers was enhanced by Al doping, for Al doping up to 3 at.%, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the ZnO (002) diffraction peak increased, resulting in a decrease in the average grain size. The intensity of the ZnO (002) diffraction peak of ZnO crystals grown on AZO seed layers increased as the Al doping concentration was increased to 1.0 at.%. The narrowest FWHM in the photoluminescence spectrum, 132 meV was obtained at an Al doping concentration of 1.0 at.%. These results indicate that the structural and the optical properties of ZnO crystals grown on seed layers can be enhanced by introducing a small amount of an Al dopant into the seed layers.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0374-4884			WOS:000304094600019

The availability of accessible alkyne groups on the surface of the aqueous-phase particles allows for the in situ surface modification of the particles through a copper(I) catalyzed Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition with an azide-terminated surface agent. The core is an extensively crosslinked polymer which can be easily removed by dispersing the particles in a solvent and centrifuging and collecting the cores, leaving the solubilized shells. This allows for the complete characterization of the colloidal surface reactions in the absence of the volumetrically dominant core. The technique is demonstrated with a core-shell colloid composed of a 135 nm crosslinked polystyrene (PS) core coated with a ca. 10 nm thick uncrosslinked poly(methyl acrylate-co-propargyl acrylate) shell. Due to the applicability of this technique for generating particles useful in biomedical imaging or drug delivery applications, the core-shell particles are surface modified with a variety of azide-terminated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) derivatives, including a poloxamer which was terminated on either end by an azide and a naphthalimide chromophore. The resulting fluorescent particles had an absorbance at 413 nm and peak emission at 525 nm. The PEG derivatives could be attached to the particles at a grafting density of ca. 0.2-0.3 groups/ nm(2).									4	0	0	0	0	4			1744-683X			WOS:000303998700012

These highly fluorescent carbon dots were evaluated for optical imaging in mice, from which bright fluorescence images were obtained. Of particular interest was the observed competitive performance of the carbon dots in vivo to that of the well-established CdSe/ZnS QDs. The results suggest that carbon dots may be further developed into a new class of high-performance yet nontoxic contrast agents for optical bioimaging.									59	3	0	18	0	62			1838-7640			WOS:000304030300007	22448196

Some common examples of these materials include polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, collagen, elastin, and various forms of polysaccharides. In terms of application, these materials are primarily used in the construction of scaffolds that aid in the local delivery of cells and growth factors, and in many cases fulfill a mechanical role in supporting physiologic loads that would otherwise be supported by a healthy tissue. In this review we will examine the development of scaffolds derived from biopolymers and their use with various cell types in the context of tissue engineering the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0065-3195		978-3-642-27855-6	WOS:000303540200007

Evaluating the Potential for Differential Susceptibility of Common Reed (Phragmites australis) Haplotypes I and M to Aquatic Herbicides								INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT				5	1			101	105		10.1614/IPSM-D-11-00051.1			JAN-MAR 2012	2012	Common reed (Phragmites australis) is an invasive perennial grass in aquatic and riparian environments across the United States, forming monotypic stands that displace native vegetation that provides food and cover for wildlife. Generic variation in global populations of common reed has given rise to two invasive haplotypes, I and M, in the United States. Our objectives were to (1) determine if any differences in herbicide efficacy exist with respect to common reed haplotypes and M and (2) screen for other labeled aquatic herbicides that may have activity on common reed haplotypes 1 and M, most notably imazamox and diquat. A replicated outdoor mesocosm study was conducted in 1,136-L (300-gal) tanks using haplotypes 1 and M of common reed. Restriction fragment length polymorphism methodologies were used to verify the identification of 1 and M haplotypes used in this study. Diquat at 2.2 (1.9) and 4.5 (4.0) kg at ha(-1) (lb ai ac(-1)), glyphosate at 2.1 (1.8) and 4.2 (3.7) kg ae ha(-1) (lb ae ac(-1)), imazamox at 0.6 (0.5) and 1.1 (0.9) kg ai ha(-1) (lb ai ac(-1)), imazapyr at 0.8 (0.7) and 1.7 (1.5) kg ai ha(-1) (lb ai ac(-1)), and triclopyr at 3.4 (3.0) and 6.7 (5.9) kg ac ha(-1) (lb ae ac(-1)) were applied to the foliage of common reed. After 12 wk, no difference (P = 0.28) in herbicide tolerance was seen between the two haplotypes with respect to biomass. The 4.2-kg ae ha(-1) rate of glyphosate and the 0.8- and 1.7 kg ai ha(-1) rates of imazapyr reduced common reed by > 90% at 12 wk after treatment (WAT). Imazamox at 0.6 and 1.1 kg ai ha(-1), and triclopyr at 3.4 and 6.7 kg ae ha(-1) reduced common reed biomass (62-86%) at 12 WAT, though regrowth occurred. Diquat did not significantly reduce biomass by 12 wk. Glyphosate and imazapyr were the only herbicides that resulted in > 90% biomass reduction and corroborate control from previous studies.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1939-7291			WOS:000302200500011
