Although the previous research has identified the perceptual changes associated with driving in fog and shows that people are highly likely to perceive their speed to be higher than it actually is, these research studies have not investigated driving behavior when drivers are allowed to maintain speed as they feel appropriate and make use of the vehicle's speedometer. In addition, much of the existing research focuses on speed perception and presents a limited view of other driving performance metrics in terms of lane keeping and event detection. The current study addresses these issues utilizing a driving simulator-based method where fog is simulated as a distance dependent contrast reduction while having participants drive at speeds they feel are appropriate. A number of different instructions and speed feedback mechanisms were tested in order to determine how drivers react when driving in varying levels of fog. Results also include lane keeping measures in order to assess whether drivers are willing to drive at speeds where their lane keeping performance is degraded due to the reduced visibility. Results indicate that, in general, drivers do not tend to slow down significantly until visibility distance is drastically reduced by fog; however, lane keeping ability is maintained throughout most of the range of visibility distances. Lane keeping ability was reduced only when fog results in. visibility distances < 30m. Overall, the current study shows that drivers are willing and able to maintain vehicular control at high speed when driving in fog; however, it is important to note that drivers chose to drive at speeds where they would be incapable of stopping to avoid obstacles in the roadway even if they were to identify and react to the obstacle immediately at the border of visibility distance. This research suggests that safety benefits may be gained by convincing drivers to slow down more than they would on their own when driving in fog or enhancing a vehicle's ability to identify and react to hazards that are not visible to the driver. In order to further understand the effects of driving in fog, future naturalistic driving research should focus on identifying and mitigating risky behaviors associated with driving in foggy conditions.

Twenty visually normal drivers (mean age = 40.3 years) participated in an experiment conducted at two open-road work sites (one suburban and one freeway) at night-time. At each site, four road workers walked in place wearing a standard road worker night vest either (a) alone, (b) with additional retroreflective strips on thighs, (c) with additional retroreflective strips on ankles and knees, or (d) with additional retroreflective strips on eight moveable joints (full biomotion). Participants, seated in stationary vehicles at three different distances (80 m, 160 m, 240 m), rated the relative conspicuity of the four road workers. Road worker conspicuity was maximized by the full biomotion configuration at all distances and at both sites. The addition of ankle and knee markings also provided significant benefits relative to the standard vest alone. The effects of clothing configuration were more evident at the freeway site and at shorter distances. Overall, the full biomotion configuration was ranked to be most conspicuous and the vest least conspicuous. These data provide the first evidence that biomotion effectively enhances conspicuity of road workers at open-road work sites. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This is a common practice in single-system development, and continues to hold in Software Product Lines (SPL). Even though extensive research has been done in the SPL Testing field, it is necessary to assess the current state of research and practice, in order to provide practitioners with evidence that enable fostering its further development.Objective: This paper focuses on Testing in SPL and has the following goals: investigate state-of-the-art testing practices, synthesize available evidence, and identify gaps between required techniques and existing approaches, available in the literature.Method: A systematic mapping study was conducted with a set of nine research questions, in which 120 studies, dated from 1993 to 2009, were evaluated.Results: Although several aspects regarding testing have been covered by single-system development approaches, many cannot be directly applied in the SPL context due to specific issues. In addition, particular aspects regarding SPL are not covered by the existing SPL approaches, and when the aspects are covered, the literature just gives brief overviews. This scenario indicates that additional investigation, empirical and practical, should be performed.Conclusion: The results can help to understand the needs in SPL Testing, by identifying points that still require additional investigation, since important aspects regarding particular points of software product lines have not been addressed yet.

J	Brice, Allyn R.; Dominy, Brian N.								Analyzing the Robustness of the MM/PBSA Free Energy Calculation Method: Application to DNA Conformational Transitions								JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY				32	7			1431	1440		10.1002/jcc.21727			MAY 2011	2011	The ability to predict and characterize free energy differences associated with conformational equilibria or the binding of biomolecules is vital to understanding the molecular basis of many important biological functions. As biological studies focus on larger molecular complexes and properties of the genome, proteome, and interactome, the development and characterization of efficient methods for calculating free energy becomes increasingly essential. The aim of this study is to examine the robustness of the end-point free energy method termed the molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann solvent accessible surface area (MM/PBSA) method. Specifically, applications of MM/PBSA to the conformational equilibria of nucleic acid (NA) systems are explored. This is achieved by comparing A to B form DNA conformational free energy differences calculated using MM/PBSA with corresponding free energy differences determined with a more rigorous and time-consuming umbrella sampling algorithm. In addition, the robustness of NA MM/PBSA calculations is also evaluated in terms of the sensitivity towards the choice of force field and the choice of solvent model used during conformational sampling. MM/PBSA calculations of the free energy difference between A-form and B-form DNA are shown to be in very close agreement with the PMF result determined using an umbrella sampling approach. Further, it is found that the MM/PBSA conformational free energy differences were also in agreement using either the CHARMM or AMBER force field. The influence of ionic strength on conformational stability was particularly insensitive to the choice of force field. Finally, it is also shown that the use of a generalized Born implicit solvent during conformational sampling results in free energy estimates that deviate slightly from those obtained using explicitly solvated MD simulations in these NA systems.

The main advantage of using QFD and AHP is their abilities to rank choices in the order of their effectiveness in meeting the functional objective. AHP discriminates between competing options where interrelated objectives need to be met; AHP is based on straightforward mathematical formulations. QFD on the other side is a customer focused method that usually starts by collecting customer needs and tries to integrate these needs into the product. In this study, following classes of engineering materials are analyzed; forming grade Bake Harden-able steel (BH), Dual Phase steel (DP), High Strength Low Alloy Steel (HSLA), Martenistic steel, Aluminum 5xxx, 6xxx sheets, Magnesium sheets, Titanium sheets, Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) and High Density Polyethylene (HDPE). The presented study showed that the different grades of steel gained the first ranks in the selection process for almost most of the BiW panels; however other alternatives could work in trade-off with cost and manufacturability.

A method for wet spinning of alginate fibers with a high concentration of single-walled carbon nanotubes								CARBON				49	6			1859	1868		10.1016/j.carbon.2011.01.008			MAY 2011	2011	A method is described for the wet spinning of alginate fibers with a loading of single-walled carbon nanotubes as high as 23 wt%. Electrostatic assembling of polyelectrolytes and nanotubes coated with sodium dodecyl sulfate is exploited by using calcium as a cross-linking agent. The Young's modulus of these fibers depends non-monotonically on nanotube concentration which is explained using Halpin-Tsai and Voigt models. Scanning electron microscope micrographs and resistivity analysis of the fibers suggest that the nanotube-alginate system undergoes a morphological transition from a composite structure of discrete nanotube bundles embedded in an alginate matrix to a complex continuous structure consisting of a nanotube network interwoven into a macromolecular network of alginate. The nanotube-alginate fibers have unprecedented high flexibility and a very high electrical conductivity similar to semimetals (between germanium and carbon).

While the experimental approaches are mainly; the subjective observers, the thermal manikins, and the Infrared Thermography. Additionally the manuscript discusses and analyses each of the thermal indices that are typically used in assessing the in-cabin conditions such as the Predicted Mean Value PMV index and the Predicted Percentage Dissatisfied PPD. The text also highlights the main attributes of vehicular thermal comfort, in terms of its fast transient behavior, the in-homogeneity in the thermal fields associated with the high localized air velocity, solar loads and flux, in addition to the inherent variations related to the trip durations.

J	Fisher, Thomas J.; Sun, Xiaoqian					Fisher, Thomas/0000-0001-5885-7646			Improved Stein-type shrinkage estimators for the high-dimensional multivariate normal covariance matrix								COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS				55	5			1909	1918		10.1016/j.csda.2010.12.006			MAY 1 2011	2011	Many applications require an estimate for the covariance matrix that is non-singular and well-conditioned. As the dimensionality increases, the sample covariance matrix becomes ill-conditioned or even singular. A common approach to estimating the covariance matrix when the dimensionality is large is that of Stein-type shrinkage estimation. A convex combination of the sample covariance matrix and a well-conditioned target matrix is used to estimate the covariance matrix. Recent work in the literature has shown that an optimal combination exists under mean-squared loss, however it must be estimated from the data. In this paper, we introduce a new set of estimators for the optimal convex combination for three commonly used target matrices. A simulation study shows an improvement over those in the literature in cases of extreme high-dimensionality of the data. A data analysis shows the estimators are effective in a discriminant and classification analysis. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Multiple-access interference may be better tolerated in these systems, allowing higher levels of spatial reuse and a reduction in the overhead required to schedule transmissions. We present a protocol which leverages these features of DSSS to support greater end-to-end throughput and terminal mobility rates. A protocol extension allows terminals to adjust protocol overhead in order to preserve network connectivity in sparse networks. For each transmission, terminals use a combination of common and transmitter-oriented spreading sequences in a format which allows for discovery of nearby terminals and adaptation of transmission rates to maximize throughput. The protocol does not operate over an artificial network graph, nor does it require an initialization phase or two-way exchange of information during a transmission slot. Through simulations, we evaluate the performance of the transmission scheduling protocol in a variety of static and mobile scenarios. For comparison, we also simulate a centralized transmission scheduling protocol with perfect knowledge of topology. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

These results apply to the lower thermosphere region near 240 km and were obtained during a period of weak solar activity with the solar flux typically within the range of 72 and 82 solar flux units. Examination of the monthly averaged meridional thermospheric winds for 1 year of measurement from October 2009 to September 2010 found the wind direction to be equatorward during summer months throughout the early evening hours with maximum speeds reaching similar to 65 ms(-1). During winter months, the early evening meridional wind direction reversed to poleward with similar speeds. This result is attributed to the cross-hemispheric flow from the summer to winter hemisphere. Superimposed upon this wintertime meridional wind flow was an equatorward surge shortly before midnight. This surge shifted to earlier local times in the transition from the vernal equinox to summer and to later local times between the summer solstice and the autumnal equinox; this flow feature is attributed to tidal wave forcing. The temperature observations exhibited the expected behavior, with the midnight temperature maximum showing a greater amplitude, similar to 120 K, in the vernal equinox with somewhat weaker amplitudes, similar to 75 K, seen at earlier local times during the summer. Also observed was a phase lag of 60 to 90 min between the appearance of the equatorward meridional wind flow and occurrence of the midnight temperature maximum peak.									27	0	0	0	0	27			2169-9380	2169-9402		WOS:000290104900002

The Temperature Intervals With Global Exchange of Replicas Empirical Accelerated Sampling Method: Parameter Sensitivity and Extension to a Complex Molecular System								JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY				32	6			1091	1100		10.1002/jcc.21689			APR 30 2011	2011	The recently developed "temperature intervals with global exchange of replicas'' (TIGER2) algorithm is an efficient replica-exchange sampling algorithm that provides the freedom to specify the number of replicas and temperature levels independently of the size of the system and temperature range to be spanned, thus making it particularly well suited for sampling molecular systems that are considered to be too large to be sampled using conventional replica exchange methods. Although the TIGER2 method is empirical in nature, when appropriately applied it is able to provide sampling that satisfies the balance condition and closely approximates a Boltzmann-weighted ensemble of states. In this work, we evaluated the influence of factors such as temperature range, temperature spacing, replica number, and sampling cycle design on the accuracy of a TIGER2 simulation based on molecular dynamics simulations of alanine dipeptide in implicit solvent. The influence of these factors is further examined by calculating the properties of a complex system composed of the B1 immunoglobulin-binding domain of streptococcal protein G (protein G) in aqueous solution. The accuracy of a TIGER2 simulation is particularly sensitive to the maximum temperature level selected for the simulation. A method to determine the appropriate maximum temperature level to be used in a TIGER2 simulation is presented. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Several recent studies reported in the literature suggested that polyurea has a relatively high potential for mitigation of the effects associated with blast and ballistic impact. This behavior of polyurea is believed to be closely related to its micro-phase segregated microstructure (consisting of the so-called "hard domains" and a soft matrix) and to different phenomena/processes (e.g. inelastic-deformation and energy-dissipation) taking place at, or in the vicinity of, the shock front. The findings obtained in the present analysis are used to help elucidate the molecular-level character of these phenomena/processes. In addition, the analysis yielded the shock Hugoniot (i.e. a set of axial stress vs. density/specific-volume vs. internal energy vs. particle velocity vs. temperature vs. shock speed) material states obtained in polyurea after the passage of a shock wave. The availability of a shock Hugoniot is critical for construction of a high deformation-rate, large-strain, high pressure material models which can be used within a continuum-level computational analysis to capture the response of a polyurea-based macroscopic structure (e.g. blast-protection helmet suspension pads) to blast/ballistic impact loading.

The spectra were correlated to the nanoparticles shape, size, and orientation as determined by scanning electron microscopy. The intensity of depolarized scattered light from nonspherical silver nanoparticles strongly depends upon particle shape and orientation relative to the polarization vector. The intensity of depolarized scattered light also increases with the aspect ratio of the nanoparticle. The depolarized light scattering originated from the interference of the plasmon modes corresponding to the electron oscillations along different axes of the NPs.									7	0	0	2	0	7			1932-7447			WOS:000289403200015

However, an SWNT is either metallic Or semiconducting; these properties are distinctively different: in,electrical conductivity and many other aspects. The available bulk production methods generally yield mixtures of metallic and semiconducting SWNTs, despite continuing efforts in metallicity-selective nanotabe growth. Presented here are significant advances and major achievements in the development of postproduction separation methods, which are now capable of harvesting separated metallic and semiconducting SWNTs from different production sources with sufficiently high enrichment and quantities for satisfying at least the needs in research and technological explorations. Opportunities and some available examples for the use of metallic SWNTs in transparent electrodes and semiconducting SWNTs in various device nanotechnologies are highlighted and discussed.									35	3	0	2	0	35			0743-7463			WOS:000289321000013	20942475

The solutions of the equation of motion for the density operator are obtained for a spin-orbit coupling linear in the electron momentum (Rashba) and they are used to calculate the time-dependent charge and spin currents. We find that there are critical values of phi at which the charge current disappears, while the spin current reaches a maximum or a minimum value.									11	0	0	0	0	11			1098-0121			WOS:000291976300010

This allows time analyses near the Nyquist frequency (2 days) which is used for a study of the quasi 2 day wave (QTDW) in summer. The well-known maximum near solstice is observed. In addition, there are two unexpected side maxima about 45-60 days before and after the center peak. A similar triplet is seen in the QTDW analysis of Microwave Limb Sounder temperature data. The triple structure is also found in a very similar form 15 years earlier in the interval 1988-1993 in early Wuppertal data. In these 15 years the time distance between the first and last triple peak has increased by about 22 days. Amplitudes of the QTDW correspond to the meridional gradient of the quasi-geostrophic potential vorticity (from MLS data) and baroclinic instabilities (bc) from radar winds (at Juliusruh, 55 degrees N, 13 degrees E). Parameter bc also shows a triple structure, when mean values 2003-2008 are calculated. The QTDW triplet results from the combination of atmospheric (in) stability and critical wind speed. The widening of the QTDW triple structure suggests a long-term change of mesospheric stability and wind structure. This is found, indeed, in the bc and zonal wind data. The changes likely reflect a long-term circulation change in the middle atmosphere extending up to the mesopause.									14	0	0	0	0	14			2169-897X			WOS:000289648100003		
J	Haiminen, Niina; Feltus, F. Alex; Parida, Laxmi								Assessing pooled BAC and whole genome shotgun strategies for assembly of complex genomes								BMC GENOMICS				12						194	10.1186/1471-2164-12-194			APR 15 2011	2011	Background: We investigate if pooling BAC clones and sequencing the pools can provide for more accurate assembly of genome sequences than the "whole genome shotgun" (WGS) approach. Furthermore, we quantify this accuracy increase. We compare the pooled BAC and WGS approaches using in silico simulations. Standard measures of assembly quality focus on assembly size and fragmentation, which are desirable for large whole genome assemblies. We propose additional measures enabling easy and visual comparison of assembly quality, such as rearrangements and redundant sequence content, relative to the known target sequence.Results: The best assembly quality scores were obtained using 454 coverage of 15x linear and 5x paired (3kb insert size) reads (15L-5P) on Arabidopsis. This regime gave similarly good results on four additional plant genomes of very different GC and repeat contents. BAC pooling improved assembly scores over WGS assembly, coverage and redundancy scores improving the most.Conclusions: BAC pooling works better than WGS, however, both require a physical map to order the scaffolds. Pool sizes up to 12Mbp work well, suggesting this pooling density to be effective in medium-scale re-sequencing applications such as targeted sequencing of QTL intervals for candidate gene discovery. Assuming the current Roche/454 Titanium sequencing limitations, a 12 Mbp region could be re-sequenced with a full plate of linear reads and a half plate of paired-end reads, yielding 15L-5P coverage after read pre-processing. Our simulation suggests that massively over-sequencing may not improve accuracy. Our scoring measures can be used generally to evaluate and compare results of simulated genome assemblies.									9	0	0	9	0	9			1471-2164			WOS:000291031300001	21496274

The simulations were performed using a much longer simulation system than our previous simulations in order to investigate the full nonlinear stage of the Weibel instability and its particle acceleration mechanism. Cold jet electrons are thermalized and ambient electrons are accelerated in the resulting shocks. Acceleration of ambient electrons leads to a maximum ambient electron density three times larger than the original value as predicted by hydrodynamic shock compression. In the jet (reverse) shock behind the bow (forward) shock the strongest electromagnetic fields are generated. These fields may lead to time dependent afterglow emission. In order to calculate radiation from first principles that goes beyond the standard synchrotron model used in astrophysical objects we have used PIC simulations. Initially we calculated radiation from electrons propagating in a uniform parallel magnetic field to verify the technique. We then used the technique to calculate emission from electrons in a small simulation system. From these simulations we obtained spectra which are consistent with those generated from electrons propagating in turbulent magnetic fields with red noise. This turbulent magnetic field is similar to the magnetic field generated at an early nonlinear stage of the Weibel instability. A fully developed shock within a larger simulation system may generate a jitter/synchrotron spectrum. (C) 2011 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

However, fabrication of encapsulated microspheres from highly viscous materials has always been a manufacturing challenge. The objective of this study is to explore a novel metallic foil-assisted laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT), a laser-assisted fabrication technique, to make encapsulated microspheres using high sodium alginate concentration solutions. The proposed four-layer approach includes a quartz disk, a sacrificial and adhesive layer, a metallic foil, and a transferred suspension layer. It is found that the proposed four-layer modified LIFT approach provides a promising fabrication technology for making of bead-encapsulated microspheres from highly viscous solutions. During the process, the microsphere only can be formed if the direct-writing height is larger than the critical direct-writing height; otherwise, tail structured droplets are formed; and the encapsulated microsphere diameter linearly increases with the laser fluence and decreases with the sodium alginate concentration.

J	Tsai, Yu-Tung; Mo, Xunhua; Campos, Andrew; Goodwin, James G., Jr.; Spivey, James J.								Hydrotalcite supported Co catalysts for CO hydrogenation								APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL				396	1-2			91	100		10.1016/j.apcata.2011.01.043			APR 15 2011	2011	It is well known that the catalytic performance of Co catalysts depends on supports and promoters. The focus of this work was to investigate the catalytic activities for CO hydrogenation of Co catalysts supported on the solid base, hydrotalcite (HT), and to probe the role of support in the reaction. A cobalt catalyst containing 10 wt% cobalt supported on HT was prepared using the incipient wetness impregnation method. Pre-calcined HT (CHT), alumina and magnesium oxide were also employed as supports for comparison purposes. Catalysts were characterized by surface area and porosity analysis, XRD, TEM/STEM/EDX, TPR and H(2) chemisorption. The catalytic activity was tested using a fixed-bed reactor at 230 degrees C, 1.8 atm, and H(2)/CO = 2. It was found that the hydrotalcite supported catalyst showed the highest steady-state reaction rates. The activities of Co/HT reduced at different reduction temperatures (from 300 to 600 degrees C) were also compared. Reduction at 500 degrees C resulted in the highest activity; however, CH(4) selectivity was also enhanced as the reduction temperature increased. The product distributions for Co/HT obeyed an Anderson-Schulz-Flory distribution. The alpha values were not impacted by the different reduction temperatures for Co/HT. The characterization and reactivity results suggest that the thermal stability properties of hydrotalcite, BET surface area, particle size of Co, the interaction between Co and the support, and the reducibility of Co were all important in governing the catalytic performance of the Co catalysts for CO hydrogenation. Our study suggests that HT is a promising support for Co for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis because it gives high activity (higher than Co/Al(2)O(3)) without the need for a reduction promoter.

Various spectroscopic techniques were employed to characterize the binding of conjugate 3 to 4. A competition dialysis assay revealed that 3 preferentially binds to 4, in the presence of other nucleic acids, including DNA, RNA, DNA RNA hybrids, and other higher-order structures (single strands, duplexes, triplexes, other G-quadruplexes, and the i-motif). UV thermal denaturation studies showed that thermal stabilization of 4 increases as a function of the increasing concentration of 3. The fluorescence intercalator displacement (FID) assay displayed a significantly tighter binding of 3 with 4 as compared to its parent constituents [220-fold stronger than neomycin (1) and 4.5-fold stronger than perylene diamine (2), respectively]. The binding of 3 with 4 resulted in pronounced changes in the molar ellipticity of the DNA absorption region as confirmed by circular dichroism. The UV vis absorption studies of the binding of 3 to 4 resulted in a red shift in the spectrum of 3 as well as a marked hypochromic. change in the perylene absorption region, suggesting that the ligand quadruplex interaction involves stacking of the perylene moiety. Docking studies suggest that the perylene moiety serves as a bridge that end stacks on 4, making contacts with two thymine bases in the loop, while the two neomycin moieties branch into the grooves of 4.									48	1	0	25	0	48			0006-2960			WOS:000289029200015	21329360

A compelling CO2 sequestration option is its photocatalytic conversion to hydrocarbons, for which the use of solar irradiation represents an ultimate solution. Here we report a new strategy of using surface-functionalized small carbon nanoparticles to harvest visible photons for subsequent charge separation on the particle surface in order to drive the efficient photocatalytic process. The aqueous solubility of the catalysts enables photoreduction under more desirable homogeneous reaction conditions. Beyond CO2 conversion, the nanoscale carbon-based photocatalysts are also useful for the photogeneration of H-2 from water under similar conditions.									228	16	0	30	0	238			0002-7863			WOS:000289492700025	21401091

Orientable edge colorings of graphs								DISCRETE APPLIED MATHEMATICS				159	7	SI		595	604		10.1016/j.dam.2010.05.010			APR 6 2011	2011	An edge coloring of a graph is orientable if and only if it is possible to orient the edges of the graph so that the color of each edge is determined by the head of its corresponding oriented arc. The goals of this paper include finding a forbidden substructure characterization of orientable colorings and giving a linear time recognition algorithm for orientable colorings. An edge coloring is lexical if and only if it is possible to number the vertices of the graph so that the color of each edge is determined by its lower endpoint. Lexical colorings are, of course, the orientable colorings in which the underlying orientation is acyclic. Lexical colorings play an important role in Canonical Ramsey theory, and it is this standpoint that motivates the current study. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

We find that the low-temperature specific heat is dominated by two Einstein terms of approximate energies of 2.5 and 5 meV. The specific-heat behavior is consistent with the amorphous low-temperature thermal conductivity behavior and validates the glassy nature of the structure. We performed the synthesis of quenched samples in an attempt to eliminate the presence of micro-cracks, whose existence presumably enhances electronic scattering. We find that quenching eliminates the presence of micro-cracks but does not result in an improvement of the figure of merit. Specifically, the highest ZT obtained in the quenched samples (ZT = 1.5), though very competitive, is still significantly less that the ZT obtained in the slow-cooled samples (ZT = 1.75).									1	0	0	0	0	1			0953-8984			WOS:000288749300009	21415478

The integration of locomotion and prey capture in divergent cottid fishes: functional disparity despite morphological similarity								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY				214	7			1092	1099		10.1242/jeb.052068			APR 2011	2011	Many mobile animals rely on the integration of locomotion and feeding to capture prey. Fishes commonly swim up to a prey item and utilize a combination of ram and suction feeding for prey capture. Marine cottids represent a diverse and abundant lineage of fishes that exhibit variation in feeding mode that is related to their mouth morphology. However, little is known regarding the integration of the locomotor and feeding systems during prey capture. We quantified the feeding kinematics, feeding performance and integration of locomotion and feeding in two species of divergent cottids: Blepsias cirrhosus (silver-spotted sculpin) and Oligocottus maculosus (tidepool sculpin). Individuals were caught from sympatric habitats near the Bamfield Marine Sciences Centre on Vancouver Island and filmed with a high-speed video camera (500 Hz) while feeding on amphipod prey. Two principal component axes summarize differences in integration and feeding mode despite similarity in attack velocity and feeding morphology ( peak gape, peak cranial elevation and peak jaw protrusion). A greater number of correlations between locomotor and feeding variables in B. cirrhosus, compared with O. maculosus, indicate greater integration. We conclude that traditional measures of attack kinematics do not capture functionally and ecologically relevant differences between species. The mechanisms underlying differences in locomotor strategy likely result from unexplored morphological or ecological differences between species. In cottids, integration is apparent in more basal, subtidal species such as B. cirrhosus, and the need for integration may be superceded by demands from the habitat in more derived, shallow-water species such as O. maculosus.									12	0	0	12	0	12			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000288155200014	21389193

Hydrodynamic stability of the painted turtle (Chrysemys picta): effects of four-limbed rowing versus forelimb flapping in rigid-bodied tetrapods								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY				214	7			1153	1162		10.1242/jeb.046045			APR 2011	2011	Hydrodynamic stability is the ability to resist recoil motions of the body produced by destabilizing forces. Previous studies have suggested that recoil motions can decrease locomotor performance, efficiency and sensory perception and that swimming animals might utilize kinematic strategies or possess morphological adaptations that reduce recoil motions and produce more stable trajectories. We used high-speed video to assess hydrodynamic stability during rectilinear swimming in the freshwater painted turtle (Chrysemys picta). Parameters of vertical stability (heave and pitch) were non-cyclic and variable, whereas measures of lateral stability (sideslip and yaw) showed repeatable cyclic patterns. In addition, because freshwater and marine turtles use different swimming styles, we tested the effects of propulsive mode on hydrodynamic stability during rectilinear swimming, by comparing our data from painted turtles with previously collected data from two species of marine turtle (Caretta caretta and Chelonia mydas). Painted turtles had higher levels of stability than both species of marine turtle for six of the eight parameters tested, highlighting potential disadvantages associated with 'aquatic flight'. Finally, available data on hydrodynamic stability of other rigid-bodied vertebrates indicate that turtles are less stable than boxfish and pufferfish.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0022-0949			WOS:000288155200022	21389201

Ecology of Symbiotes of Larval Black Flies (Diptera: Simuliidae): Distribution, Diversity, and Scale								ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY				40	2			289	302		10.1603/EN10258			APR 2011	2011	Symbioses are major drivers in ecology and evolution. Although nearly omnipresent in flowing waters, they remain poorly studied in these systems. To examine fundamental aspects of the ecology of symbioses in flowing-water systems, we use larval black flies as hosts and various fungi, nematodes, and protists as symbiotes, focusing on aspects of distribution, diversity, and scale. Most symbiotes of larval black flies are considered parasitic, although the dynamic nature of the relationship is becoming apparent for some systems in which it shifts along a continuum involving commensalism, mutualism, and parasitism. Perspective also is moving from a pairwise view of symbiotic associations to a multispecies network of interactions. Distributions of symbiotes are related to scale-dependent processes that influence the hosts and the stream habitats of the hosts; thus, characteristics of streams, as well as hosts, can be useful in predicting spatial patterns of symbiotes. As the taxonomy of symbiotes improves, so too does the understanding of ecological relationships of symbiosis, such as host specificity and patterns of diversity along spatial and temporal scales.									11	1	0	11	0	13			0046-225X	1938-2936		WOS:000294109900012

Records of these plant bugs are the first for New Mexico and southernmost in the United States. The species are univoltine and overwinter as eggs, with those of C. caricis and Teratocoris caricis hatching in early to mid-May; eggs of the delphacid predators Tytthus pubescens and T pygmaeus might hatch later. A syntopic delphacid, Nothodelphax venusta (Beamer), probably serves as prey of Tytthus species, as well as C. caricis, a facultative predator of Delphacidae. The four Holarctic minds are considered relictual in the Jemez Mountains (Southern Rocky Mountains Ecoregion) rather than post-Pleistocene colonists.

Determination of genetic relationships among elite thermosensitive genic male sterile lines (TGMS) of rice (Oryza sativa L.) employing morphological and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers								JOURNAL OF GENETICS				90	1			11	19					APR 2011	2011	A set of morphological traits and SSR markers were used to determine the genetic relationship among 12 elite thermosensitive genic male sterile (TGMS) lines developed at three different research institutions of India. Agro-morphological data recorded on 20 morphological traits revealed a wide base of genetic variation and a set of four morphological traits could distinguish most of the TGMS lines. Analysis with 30 SSR markers (20 EST-SSRs and 10 genomic SSRs) revealed 27 markers to be polymorphic, amplifying a total of 83 alleles. Each SSR marker amplified 2-6 alleles with an average of 2.76 alleles per marker and a PIC value varying from 0.54 to 0.96. Cluster analysis based on SSR and morphological data clearly differentiated the lines according to their source of origin. Correlation analysis between morphological and molecular data revealed a very poor association (r = 0.06), which could be attributed to selection pressure, genetic drift, sampling error and unknown relationship among related lines. The SSR markers discriminated the genotypes distinctly and quantified the genetic diversity precisely among the TGMS lines. Data on the yield per plant indicated that the genotypes grouping under a similar cluster showed same heterotic behaviour as compared to the genotypes from different clusters when crossed to similar pollinators.									2	0	0	2	1	2			0022-1333			WOS:000291685400002	21677384

Evaluation of New Transgenic Corn Hybrids Producing Multiple Bacillus thuringiensis Toxins in South Carolina								JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGICAL SCIENCE				46	2			152	164					APR 2011	2011	Transgenic corn, Zea mays L., hybrids expressing insecticidal Cry proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) were evaluated for control of insect pests in Florence and Blackville, SC, in 2009 and 2010. Two planting dates were used in trials in 2010. Early- and midseason pests and associated injury were consistently absent or at low numbers. Data analyses were limited primarily to Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) injury and infestations in corn ears. In Florence in 2009, event MON89034 reduced injury by 97% based on number of injured kernels per ear compared with the non-Bt isoline. Events TC1507 reduced injury by 53% across both years and locations of our study. The combined events MON89034 and TC1507 in a SmartStax hybrid significantly (P < 0.05) reduced injury by 98% compared with the non-Bt isoline across both years and locations of our study. The excellent control of H. zea in SmartStax was, therefore, the result of the MON89034 event, rather than the TC1507 event. Planting date did not significantly (P > 0.05) affect injury or yield at both locations in 2010. Yield was not affected by Bt traits. The increased effectiveness of recent hybrids with the MON89034 event in controlling H. zea in corn ears may lead to increased planting of Bt corn in the southeastern United States, as prior events were not as effective in controlling this key pest.									4	0	0	4	0	4			0749-8004			WOS:000290012600008

In this study, we investigated the phylogeny of the Blastocladiomycota based on ribosomal DNA sequences from strains identified by traditional morphological and ultrastructural characters. Our results support the monophyly of the Coelomomycetaceae and Physodermataceae but the Blastocladiaceae and Catenariaceae are paraphyletic or polyphyletic. The data support two clades within Allomyces with strains identified as Allomyces arbusculus in both clades, suggesting that species concepts in Allomyces are in need of revision. A clade of Catenaria species isolated from midge larvae group separately from other Catenaria species, suggesting that this genus may need revision. In the Physodermataceae, Urophlyctis species cluster with a clade of Physoderma species. The algal parasite Paraphysoderma sedebokerensis nom. prov. clusters sister to other taxa in the Physodermataceae. Catenomyces persicinus, which has been classified in the Catenariaceae, groups with the Chytridiomycota rather than Blastocladiomycota. The rDNA operon seems to be suitable for classification within the Blastocladiomycota and distinguishes among genera; however, this region alone is not suitable to determine the position of the Blastocladiomycota among other basal fungal phyla with statistical support. A focused effort to find and isolate, or directly amplify DNA from additional taxa will be necessary to evaluate diversity in this phylum. We provide this rDNA phylogeny as a preliminary framework to guide further taxon and gene sampling and to facilitate future ecological, morphological, and systematic studies.

The gold bridges for the four probe measurement setup were deposited on a quartz substrate. Pattern geometry, bias current, and transverse magnetostatic field effects on the material's 1/f noise were studied. The normalized Hooge parameter and frequency slope were analyzed in the framework of the empirical Hooge relation. Different dependences of the noise versus bias current generated Oersted field and the magnetostatic field were observed. The normalized Hooge parameter and frequency slope were pattern width and field configuration dependent. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

ADVANCES IN NURSING SCIENCE				34	2			97	105		10.1097/ANS.0b013e3182139683			APR-JUN 2011	2011	The interchangeable use of functional status with quality of life has lead to various interpretations when discussing outcomes related to functional status. The literature revealed gaps in the measurement and blurred conceptualization of functional status. Given the prognostic importance of functional status measures, the results highlight the importance of developing a reliable and efficient means of obtaining a measure of functional status resulting in the advancement of nursing science. Having a clear and concise measure of functional status will enable clinicians to implement effect treatment plans that would lead to a faster recovery, higher level of functional status, and a greater well-being.									4	0	0	1	0	4			0161-9268			WOS:000290568300005	21364457	
J	Smith, Loren M.; Haukos, David A.; McMurry, Scott T.; LaGrange, Ted; Willis, David								Ecosystem services provided by playas in the High Plains: potential influences of USDA conservation programs								ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS				21	3			S82	S92		10.1890/09-1133.1		S	APR 2011	2011	Playas are shallow depressional wetlands and the dominant wetland type in the non-glaciated High Plains of the United States. This region is one of the most intensively cultivated regions in the Western Hemisphere, and playas are profoundly impacted by a variety of agricultural activities. Conservation practices promoted through Farm Bills by the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) that influence playas and surrounding catchments impact ecosystem functions and related services provided by wetlands in this region. As part of a national assessment, we review effects of agricultural cultivation and effectiveness of USDA conservation programs and practices on ecosystem functions and associated services of playas. Services provided by playas are influenced by hydrological function, and unlike other wetland types in the United States, hydrological function of playas is impacted more by accumulated sediments than drainage. Most playas with cultivated catchments have lost greater than 100% of their volume from sedimentation causing reduced hydroperiods. The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) has the largest influence on playa catchments (the High Plains has >2.8 million ha), and associated sedimentation, of any USDA program. Unfortunately, most practices applied under CRP did not consider restoration of playa ecosystem function as a primary benefit, but rather established dense exotic grass in the watersheds to reduce soil erosion. Although this has reduced soil erosion, few studies have investigated its effects on playa hydrological function and services. Our review demonstrates that the Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) has seldom been applied in the High Plains outside of south-central Nebraska. However, this is the primary program that exists within the USDA allowing conservation practices that restore wetland hydrology such as sediment removal. In addition to sediment removal, this practice has the greatest potential effect on improving hydrologic function by reducing sedimentation in vegetative buffer strips. We estimate that a 50-m nativegrass buffer strip could improve individual playa hydroperiods by up to 90 days annually, enhancing delivery of most natural playa services. The potential for restoration of playa services using USDA programs is extensive, but only if WRP and associated practices are promoted and playas are considered an integral part of CRP contracts.									33	0	0	31	0	34			1051-0761			WOS:000290660700007

Electromechanical Modeling and Normal Form Analysis of an Aeroelastic Micro-Power Generator								JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MATERIAL SYSTEMS AND STRUCTURES				22	6			577	592		10.1177/1045389X11400929			APR 2011	2011	Combining theories in continuous-systems vibrations, piezoelectricity, and fluid dynamics, we develop and experimentally validate an analytical electromechanical model to predict the response behavior of a self-excited micro-power generator. Similar to music-playing harmonica that create tones via oscillations of reeds when subjected to air blow, the proposed device uses flow-induced self-excited oscillations of a piezoelectric beam embedded within a cavity to generate electric power. To obtain the desired model, we adopt the non-linear Euler-Bernoulli beam's theory and linear constitutive relationships. We use Hamilton's principle in conjunction with electric circuits theory and the inextensibility condition to derive the partial differential equation that captures the transversal dynamics of the beam and the ordinary differential equation governing the dynamics of the harvesting circuit. Using the steady Bernoulli equation and the continuity equation, we further relate the exciting pressure at the surface of the beam to the beam's deflection, and the inflow rate of air. Subsequently, we employ a Galerkin's descritization to reduce the order of the model and show that a single-mode reduced-order model of the infinite-dimensional system is sufficient to predict the response behavior. Using the method of multiple scales, we develop an approximate analytical solution of the resulting reduced-order model near the stability boundary and study the normal form of the resulting bifurcation. We observe that a Hopf bifurcation of the super-critical nature is responsible for the onset of limit-cycle oscillations.									16	0	0	0	0	16			1045-389X			WOS:000290785600008		
J	Dong, Hong; Guarneri, Paolo; Fadel, Georges								Bi-level Approach to Vehicle Component Layout With Shape Morphing								JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN				133	4					041008	10.1115/1.4003916			APR 2011	2011	Engineering research into packing problems has been widely undertaken in recent years. The use of component shape morphing in layout design has, however, received little attention. Shape morphing is required for fitting a component of sufficient size in a limited space while optimizing the overall performance objectives of the vehicle and improving design efficiency. To morph components that can have arbitrary shapes in layout design, a mass-spring physical model-based morphing method is proposed and implemented. Vehicle layout design with shape morphing is a multi-objective, multilevel problem with a large number of design variables. To solve this large scale problem, decomposition is adopted. At the system level, the overall performance objectives are optimized with respect to locations and orientations of components. At the component level, deformable objects are morphed to fit in the available space. A vehicle underhood layout design problem is demonstrated to illustrate the proposed approach.

J	Fuller, Patrick O.; Higham, Timothy E.; Clark, Andrew J.								Posture, speed, and habitat structure: three-dimensional hindlimb kinematics of two species of padless geckos								ZOOLOGY				114	2			104	112		10.1016/j.zool.2010.11.003			APR 2011	2011	Differences in habitat use are often correlated with differences in morphology and behavior, while animals in similar habitats often exhibit similarities in form and function. However, this has not been tested extensively among lizards, especially geckos. Most studies of gecko locomotion have focused on the ability to adhere to surfaces. However, there are several species of geckos that have either secondarily lost adhesive capabilities or simply lack the capability. We quantified the three-dimensional locomotor kinematics for two desert-dwelling padless geckos, Teratoscincus scincus and Eublepharis macularius, on a level trackway over a range of speeds. Our results indicate that T. scincus landed with a high relative hip height of 48.7 +/- 2.4% of total limb length at footfall, while E. macularius exhibited hip heights averaging only 36.0 +/- 1.8% of total limb length for footfall. The three-dimensional knee angle of T. scincus averaged 120.6 +/- 3.9 degrees at footfall, while E. macularius averaged only 101.6 +/- 1.8 degrees at footfall. In addition, the femur of E. macularius was elevated to a much greater extent (i.e., was closer to being perpendicular to the long axis of the body) than that of T. scincus and every other lizard that has been studied, suggesting they move with a "hyper-sprawled" posture. Both of these gecko species live in deserts, but T. scincus is psammophilic while E. macularius inhabits a rocky, more densely vegetated environment. Benefits of the more upright posture of T. scincus on open sandy habitat may include a greater field of view and more efficient locomotion. The more sprawled posture of E. macularius may lower its center of gravity and aid in balance while climbing on rocks or shrubs. (c) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

Nano-sized particles have been used in numerous applications to improve the properties of various materials. The utilization of nanotechnology in civil engineering is expected to increase and may become an attractive alternative for asphalt binder modification. The objective of this study was to investigate and evaluate the theological properties of binders containing various percentages of carbon nanoparticles after a short-term aging process. The experimental design for this study included five binder sources (three grades including PG 64-22, PG 64-16, and PG 52-28), three nano percentages (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5% by weight of the virgin binder), and control binders. The rheological characteristics of the rolling thin film oven (RTFO) binders, including failure temperature, performance grade, creep and creep recovery, viscous flow, and frequency and amplitude sweep, were tested. The results of the experiments indicated that the addition of nanoparticles was helpful in increasing the failure temperature, complex modulus, and elastic modulus values and in improving rutting resistance of the RTFO binder. The phase angle of the binders generally decreased with an increase in nano content and RTFO aging procedure. In addition, statistical analysis indicated that the asphalt binder source plays a key role in determining the rheological properties because of significant evaluations.

In this reported work we used aqueous GOs to effectively disperse few-layer graphene sheets (GNs) in suspension for facile wet-processing into nanocomposites of GNs embedded in GOs (as the polymeric matrix). The resulting lightweight and plastic-like nanocomposite materials remained mechanically flexible even at high loadings of GNs, and they were found to be highly efficient In thermal transport, with the experimentally determined thermal diffusivity competitive to those typically observed only in well-known thermally conductive metals such as aluminum and copper. As demonstrated, GOs apparently represent a unique class of two-dimensional polymeric materials for potentially "all-carbon" nanocomposites, among others, which may find technological applications independent of those widely proclaimed for graphene sheets.									51	2	0	3	0	52			1936-0851			WOS:000289742100074	21405144

Dietary poultry fat, phytase, and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol influence the digestive and reproductive organ characteristics of commercial layers inoculated before or at the onset of lay with F-strain Mycoplasma gallisepticum								POULTRY SCIENCE				90	4			797	803		10.3382/ps.2010-01212			APR 2011	2011	Effects of 2 supplemental concentrations of dietary poultry fat (PF) and the combination of PF, phytase (PHY), and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol [25(OH) D] on the gross digestive and reproductive organ characteristics of commercial layers inoculated with F-strain Mycoplasma gallisepticum (FMG) were investigated in 2 trials. Sham and FMG inoculations were administered at 12 wk (before lay) or 22 wk (onset of lay), dietary treatments [basal control diet (BCD); BCD with 0.75% supplemental PF (LPFD); BCD with 1.50% supplemental PF (HPFD); HPFD additionally supplemented with 0.013% PHY and 0.025% 25(OH)D] were initiated at 20 wk of age, and organ characteristics were determined at 58 wk of age. In proportion to small intestine weight, jejuna were heavier in birds inoculated at 22 wk rather than at 12 wk of age. In hens inoculated at 22 wk of age, percentage of infundibulum weight was increased by FMG. The proportional length of infundibula in birds fed HPFD with PHY and 25(OH)D was longer than in those fed LPFD. In birds inoculated with FMG at 22 wk of age, BW was greater in those fed HPFD with or without added PHY and 25(OH)D in comparison with those fed LPFD, whereas LPFD increased percentage of oviduct and magnum weights when compared with the HPFD and BCD groups, respectively. Percentage of duodenum weight in birds that were fed HPFD with PHY and 25(011)D was greater compared with those fed LPFD in the wk 22 sham and wk 12 FMG inoculation groups, but was also greater than in those fed BCD in the wk 12 FMG inoculation group. Conversely, percentage of duodenum weight was greater in birds fed LPFD compared with those fed HPFD after a wk 22 FMG inoculation. However, despite the effects of the supplemental combination of 1.50% PF, PHY, and 25(OH)D on the oviduct and small intestine structures, it did not result in a subsequent influence on layer performance, as indicated in a previous companion report.									4	1	0	1	0	5			0032-5791			WOS:000289007100012	21406365

Therefore, complete evaluation of the risk posed by subsurface Pu contamination needs to include a detailed physical/chemical understanding of Pu colloid formation and interactions of Pu colloids with environmentally relevant solid phases. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to characterize Pu nanocolloids and interactions of Pu nanocolloids with goethite and quartz.. We report that intrinsic Pu nanocolloids generated in the absence of goethite or quartz were 2-5 nm in diameter, and both electron diffraction analysis and HRTEM confirm the expected Fm3m space group with the fcc, PuO2 structure. Plutonium nanocolloids formed on goethite have undergone a lattice distortion relative to the ideal fluorite-type structure, fcc, PuO2, resulting in the formation of a bcc, Pu4O7 structure. This structural distortion results from an epitaxial growth of the plutonium colloid on goethite, leading to stronger binding of plutonium to goethite compared with other minerals such as quartz, where the distortion was not observed. This finding provides new insight for understanding how molecular-scale behavior at the mineral-water interface may facilitate transport of plutonium at the field scale.									53	0	0	18	0	53			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000288841500031	21446768

Microbial community compositions in all incubations were characterized by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA). The aquifer material mineralized 42.3 +/- 9.9% of [U-C-14]-TBA to (CO2)-C-14 without electron acceptor amendment. Fe(III), sulfate, and Fe(III) plus anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate addition also promoted U-[C-14]-TBA mineralization at levels similar to those of the unamended controls. Nitrate actually inhibited TBA mineralization relative to unamended controls. In contrast to TBA, [U-C-14]-MTBE was not significantly mineralized in 400 days regardless of electron acceptor amendment. Microbial community analysis indicated that the abundance of one dominant clone group correlated closely with anaerobic TBA mineralization. The clone was phylogenetically distinct from known aerobic TBA-degrading microorganisms, Fe(III)- or sulfate-reducing bacteria. It was most closely associated with organisms belonging to the alphaproteobacteria. Microbial communities were different in MTBE and TBA amended incubations. Shannon indices and Simpson indices (statistical community comparison tools) both demonstrated that microbial community diversity decreased in incubations actively mineralizing TBA, with distinct "dominant" clones developing. These data contribute to our understanding of anaerobic microbial transformation of fuel oxygenates in contaminated aquifer material and the organisms that may catalyze the reactions.									7	0	0	5	0	7			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000288841500075	21384909

From Native Plants in Central Europe to Cultivated Crops Worldwide: The Emergence of Didymella bryoniae as a Cucurbit Pathogen								HORTSCIENCE				46	4			532	535					APR 2011	2011	Didymella bryoniae (Auersw.) Rehm [anamorph Phoma cucurbitacearum (Fr.) Sacc.], the plant pathogenic fungus that causes gummy stem blight and black rot on cucurbits, was first described in 1869 from Bryonia (bryony or wild hops) in central Europe. Today, this pathogen is found on six continents on at least 12 genera and 23 species of cucurbits. How did D. bryoniae progress from a pathogen of a native plant in central Europe to a worldwide threat to cucurbits cultivated in humid environments? Clues from the early discoveries of this fungus, its characteristics as a seedborne pathogen, and its broad adaptation to cucurbit hosts will provide some answers to this question.									15	0	0	16	0	16			0018-5345			WOS:000289594600001

This paper aims to develop an effective extended Kalman filter-based RNN training approach with a controllable training convergence. The training convergence problem during extended Kalman filter-based RNN training has been proposed and studied by adapting two artificial training noise parameters: the covariance of measurement noise (R) and the covariance of process noise (Q) of Kalman filter. The R and Q adaption laws have been developed using the Lyapunov method and the maximum likelihood method, respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed adaption laws has been tested using a nonlinear dynamical benchmark system and further applied in cutting tool wear modeling. The results show that the R adaption law can effectively avoid the divergence problem and ensure the training convergence, whereas the Q adaption law helps improve the training convergence speed.									15	1	0	0	0	16			1045-9227			WOS:000289210500007	21402512

Miller, Shelie/B-8177-2015				A Comparison of Two Methods to Conduct Material Flow Analysis on Waste Tires in a Small Island Developing State								JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY				15	2			300	314		10.1111/j.1530-9290.2010.00323.x			APR 2011	2011	P>The disposal of scrap tires is one of the biggest solid waste issues facing some small island developing states (SIDS) in the Caribbean. Dominica is a small Caribbean island nation that seeks to maintain its well-founded image as the "Nature Island of the Caribbean." The economy has seen a steadily increasing import of both tires and cars, with no mechanism for exportation of spent tires. This study used data gathered from both government and international sources to estimate the quantity of tires currently on the island and projected each year up to 2020 to determine potential reuse options. We performed a material flow analysis (MFA) using tire import, vehicle registration records, and projected per capita income to determine the expected accumulation of waste tires. Vehicle registration is expected to rise with the island's wealth, which will affect the annual flow of tires. Two methods were used to predict vehicle growth over time. Our analysis showed an average waste tire output from the economy of 47,000 to 50,000 passenger tire equivalents (PTEs) per year, or approximately 470 to 500 short tons per year of mass. Such an output does not justify large expenditures of tire shredding and processing equipment, but whole tire applications may be feasible as potential disposition options. The methods can be easily replicated to give low-range and high-range estimates of waste tires disposed in the environment.									6	0	0	4	0	6			1088-1980			WOS:000289163600011

Park, Hyun Jin/F-4735-2013; Park, Hyun Jin/I-4942-2015				Barrier property and penetration traces in packaging films against Plodia interpunctella (Hubner) larvae and Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) adults								JOURNAL OF STORED PRODUCTS RESEARCH				47	2			101	105		10.1016/j.jspr.2011.01.005			APR 2011	2011	The barrier property of different types of plastic film (with or without pinholes) against two insects, Plodia interpunctella (Hubner) larvae and Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) adults, and the morphology of damage produced in these insects were investigated. Using a penetration apparatus, four types of plastic films varying in thickness were used for insect-penetration tests: casted polypropylene, 20 mu m and 25 mu m (CPP20 and CPP25); oriented polypropylene, 20 mu m and 30 mu m (OPP20 and OPP30); linear low-density polyethylene, 40 mu m and 50 mu m (LLDPE40 and LLDPE50); and polyethylene terephthalate 12 mu m and 16 mu m (PET12 and PET16). After being fixed and tested in the penetration apparatus, each film was cut into a disc shape and 10 holes (200 mu m diameter) were made by a pin. The shape of film damage and the mouthparts of insects were observed using scanning electronic microscopy. Plodia interpunctella larvae could penetrate all films with pinholes, while T. castaneum adults were unable to penetrate any of the films tested, even those with pinholes. The penetration-percentages by P. interpunctella larvae were 38% (LLDPE40), 3% (LLDPE), 53% (CPP20), 37% (CPP25), 63% (OPP20), 43% (OPP30), 83% (PET12) and 63% (PET16). The elongation value, tensile strength and thickness of film were important factors in the penetration test. LLDPE, which has the highest elongation value and the lowest tensile strength value, was the film that best protected against insect penetration. In CPP and LLDPE films, there were many scratches and tears around the holes. In comparison, much less damage was observed around the holes in OPP and PET films. By observing the mouthparts of insects, it was determined that P. interpunctella larvae had sharper mandibles than those of T castaneum adults. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein, we report the synthesis of 20 novel acetyl analogs of CA-4 (1), synthesized from 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenylacetone that comprises the A ring of CA-4 with different aromatic aldehydes as the B ring. Molecular modeling studies indicate that these new compounds possess a 'twisted' conformation similar to CA-4. The new analogs effectively inhibit the growth of human and murine cancer cells. The most potent compounds 6k, 6s and 6t, have IC(50) values in the sub-mu M range. Analog 6t has an IC(50) of 182 nM in MDA-MB-435 cells and has advantages over earlier analogs due to its enhanced water solubility (456 mu M). This compound initiates microtubule depolymerization with an EC(50) value of 1.8 mu Min A-10 cells. In a murine L1210 syngeneic tumor model 6t had antitumor activity and no apparent toxicity.

In this study, we sequenced two bacterial artificial chromosomes harboring a FLO/LFY and three other genes from yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera L.) and compared the gene order in this locus between several species. Besides the conserved terminal domains, key residues involved in interactions with DNA bases, backbone, and in dimerization were also conserved in the yellow-poplar FLO/LFY. Phylogenetic analysis of the FLO/LFY amino acid sequences placed yellow-poplar closer to eudicots than to monocotyledonous species. We found that gene content and order in this region of the yellow-poplar genome was more similar to corresponding regions in Vitis vinifera L., Carica papaya L., Populus trichocarpa Torr. & Gray, and Ricinus communis L., regardless of the evolutionary relationship. In addition, evidence for transposition, large insertions, and duplications were found, suggesting multiple and complex mechanisms of basal angiosperm genome evolution.									2	2	0	1	0	3			1614-2942	1614-2950		WOS:000288656800013

Biological activity and quantification of potential autotoxins from Picea schrenkiana leaves								ALLELOPATHY JOURNAL				27	2			245	262					APR 2011	2011	We studied the potential autotoxicity of aqueous extracts from P. schrenkiana leaves. Water extract was partitioned against diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol sequentially. Inhibitory effects of 3-organic fractions [original water extract and the residual water (after the organic solvent extraction)] were tested on seed germination :And seedling growth of P. schrenkiana. All 5-fractions (original water extract, diethyl ether fraction, ethyl acetate fraction and n-butanol fraction) showed different phylotoxic effects on seed germination and seedling growth. Diethyl ether fraction was most phytotoxic and inhibited the seed germination and seedling growth at low concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. The chemical nature of the three organic fractions was also determined using GC-MS-MS and NMR. 17 secondary metabolites [Thhydroxyberizoic acid, 2-keto-4a-methyl-8-methoxy-2, 3, 4, 4a, 5, 6, 11, 12-octahydrochrysene (named as schrenkianaone), cinnamic acid, abscisic acid (ABA), quercetin, umbelliferone, 8-phenyllactic acid, vanillic acid, gallic acid, myristic acid, gentisic acid, 8-resorcylic acid, indole-3-carboxaldehyde, p-coumaric acid, ethyl hematommatc, esculetin and caffeic acid] were identified and quantified.

Transformation of Gaeumannomyces graminis with beta-Glucuronidase Reporter and Hygromycin Resistance Genes								JOURNAL OF PHYTOPATHOLOGY				159	4			317	320		10.1111/j.1439-0434.2010.01755.x			APR 2011	2011	Take-all disease is caused by Gaeumannomyces graminis, (Sacc.) Arx & D. Olivier, a soil-borne fungus, which colonizes the root and crown tissue of many members of the Poaceae plant family. This fungus is able to grow along the surface of roots as darkly pigmented runner hyphae, which has the ability to penetrate the root. Here, we describe a genetic transformation of G. graminis var. graminis by using polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based protoplast transformation. Fungus cells were transformed with a plasmid, pHPG, containing the gusA reporter gene that codes for beta-glucuronidase (GUS) and the hph gene for hygromycin resistance as the selectable marker. A de novo transformant selection assay was developed to identify the putative transformants that were expressing the hph gene. In addition, the transformed cells maintained the ability to infect the plant tissues. The GUS-expressing fungus can be used to study fungal infection processes including fungal penetration, colonization and the role(s) of melanin during pathogenesis. Thus, this study is the first report of G. graminis var. graminis transformed with a visibly detectable reporter gene that provides a useful tool to a better understanding of host-Gaeumannomyces interactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0931-1785			WOS:000287966100017

Web-Based Collection of Expert Opinion on Routine Scalp EEG: Software Development and Interrater Reliability								JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY				28	2			178	184		10.1097/WNP.0b013e31821215e3			APR 2011	2011	Computerized detection of epileptiform transients (ETs), characterized by interictal spikes and sharp waves in the EEG, has been a research goal for the last 40 years. A reliable method for detecting ETs would assist physicians in interpretation and improve efficiency in reviewing long-term EEG recordings. Computer algorithms developed thus far for detecting ETs are not as reliable as human experts, primarily due to the large number of false-positive detections. Comparing the performance of different algorithms is difficult because each study uses individual EEG test datasets. In this article, we present EEGnet, a distributed web-based platform for the acquisition and analysis of large-scale training datasets for comparison of different EEG ET detection algorithms. This software allows EEG scorers to log in through the web, mark EEG segments of interest, and categorize segments of interest using a conventional clinical EEG user interface. This software platform was used by seven board-certified academic epileptologists to score 40 short 30-second EEG segments from 40 patients, half containing ETs and half containing artifacts and normal variants. The software performance was adequate. Interrater reliability for marking the location of paroxysmal activity was low. Interrater reliability of marking artifacts and ETs was high and moderate, respectively.									6	0	0	3	0	6			0736-0258	1537-1603		WOS:000289068000010	21399515

Desertions were the more volatile component of marital disruptions because of their greater responsiveness to general economic conditions. Large marriage cohorts, formed in the years of economic expansion, disrupted in greater numbers: an increase in the marriage rate by 10 per 1,000 unmarried women raised the proportion of disrupted marriages by 7.3 percentage points. Conversely, during years of recession, many poorer couples were discouraged from marriage; smaller marriage cohorts with more resilient marriages were formed and their lifetime marriage disruption rate was lower.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0363-1990			WOS:000288158200003	21491798

Liquid Sampling-Atmospheric Pressure Glow Discharge Ionization Source for Elemental Mass Spectrometry								ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				83	7			2425	2429		10.1021/ac200098h			APR 1 2011	2011	A new, low power ionization source for elemental MS analysis of aqueous solutions is described. The liquid sampling-atmospheric pressure grow discharge (LS-APGD) operates by a process wherein the surface of the liquid emanating from a 75 mu m i.d. glass capillary acts as the cathode of the direct current glow discharge. Analyte-containing solutions at a flow rate of 100 mu L min(-1) are vaporized by the passage of current, yielding gas phase solutes that are subsequently ionized in the <5 W (maximum of 60 mA and 500 V), similar to 1 mm(3) volume, plasma. The LS-APGD is mounted in place of the normal electrospray ionization source of a Thermo Scientific Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer system without any other modifications. Basic operating characteristics are described, including the role of discharge power on mass spectral composition, the ability to obtain ultrahigh resolution elemental isotopic patterns, and demonstration of potential limits of detection based on the injection of aliquots of multielement standards (S/N > 1000 for 5 ng mL(-1) Cs). While much optimization remains, it is believed that the LS-APGD ion source may present a practical alternative to high-powered (>1 kW) plasma sources typically employed in elemental mass spectrometry, particularly for those cases where costs, operational overhead, simplicity, or integrated elemental/molecular analysis considerations are important.									31	3	0	17	0	34			0003-2700			WOS:000288887700004	21355580

Online Detection of Radioactive Iodine in Aqueous Systems through the Use of Scintillating Anion Exchange Resin								ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				83	7			2582	2588		10.1021/ac102880c			APR 1 2011	2011	The objective of this research was to develop a scintillating anion exchange resin selective for monitoring (129)I at concentrations at or below similar to 0.4 Bq/L. One of the primary long-term risk-drivers and contaminants associated with nuclear waste sites is (129)I. Synthesis of scintillating anion exchange resin consisted of diffusing a fluor, 2-(l-naphthyl)-5-phenyloxazole (alpha-NPO), into a polymeric resin. The resultant scintillating resin was further modified by amination with N-methyldi-n-octylamine (MDOA) to serve as an anion exchange group. Radiochromatography columns were prepared with the synthesized resin for use in a variety of flow-cell experiments utilizing a standard (129)I solution in a synthetic groundwater to determine the properties (selectivity, interferences, loading efficiency, kinetics, capacity, and detection efficiency) of the resin. Column effluents were quantified by liquid scintillation. Average loading and detection efficiencies have been measured at 91 +/- 9% and 50 +/- 4%, respectively. Finally, batch sorption studies indicated fast iodide sorption rates (90% loading in similar to 10 min) for the resin, and dynamic sorption tracer studies indicated an iodide capacity of approximately 7 800 mu g/g at 10% breakthrough.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0003-2700			WOS:000288887700027	21366321

A missense mutation in the 20S proteasome beta 2 subunit of Great Danes having harlequin coat patterning								GENOMICS				97	4			244	248		10.1016/j.ygeno.2011.01.003			APR 2011	2011	Harlequin is a pigmentary trait of the domestic dog that is controlled by two autosomal loci: the melanosomal gene, SILV, and a modifier gene, harlequin (H), previously localized to chromosome 9. Heterozygosity for a retrotransposon insertion in SILV and a mutation in H causes a pattern of black patches on a white background. Homozygosity for H is embryonic lethal. Fine mapping of the harlequin locus revealed a 25 kb interval wherein all harlequin Great Danes are heterozygous for a common haplotype. This region contains one gene, PSMB7, which encodes the beta 2 catalytic subunit of the proteasome. Sequence analysis identified a coding variant in exon 2 that segregates with harlequin patterning. The substitution predicts the replacement of a highly conserved valine with a glycine. Described herein is the identification of a naturally-occurring mutation of the ubiquitin proteasome system that is associated with a discemable phenotype of dogs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

A nationally representative sample of 10,828 youth was assessed over three different time points spanning 7 years. We conducted multivariable logistic regression to examine the main and interactive effects on the odds of making a suicide attempt 1 and 7 years later.Results: Regardless of an individual's gender, multivariable analyses indicated unique risk factors including suicidal ideation, depressive symptoms, a friend's past history of attempted and completed suicide, and a family member's past history of attempted suicide that were significantly associated with increased odds of suicide attempts made 1 and 7 years later. Parental loss predicted likelihood of suicide attempt 1 year later but not 7 years later. Moderational analyses indicated that gender did not interact with most of the risk factors. However, post hoc probing of two significant interaction terms indicated that young age was a risk factor for making a nonfatal suicide attempt 1 year later for females but not for males, and that females with high somatic symptoms had a greater risk for making a nonfatal suicide attempt as compared with those with low somatic symptoms and with males with low or high somatic symptoms.Conclusion: These results indicate similar risk factors for nonfatal suicide attempts among males and females. However, younger age and somatic symptoms were reported to be risk factors for females but not for males, suggesting the need for targeted interventions with young females with somatic complaints.

Fifty-eight Gulf sturgeon were tagged within the Escambia (n = 26), Yellow (n = 8), Blackwater (n = 12) and Choctawhatchee Rivers (n = 12) in June, July, September and October, 2005. Fifty-four Gulf sturgeon were detected at least once during the study. Migration of sturgeon occurred throughout the bay system in fall, to various winter habitats in the Gulf of Mexico and Santa Rosa Sound. In spring, tagged sturgeon migrated back through the bay system to summer habitats in rivers. Based on the duration and number of detections, Gulf sturgeon primarily used the upper portions of East and Escambia Bays as migration routes in and out of all rivers during spring and summer and inhabited the lower portion of Pensacola Bay for longer durations in fall and winter. Specific areas within the Pensacola bay system were used in summer and winter that were not previously documented as essential sturgeon habitat. Areas in southeastern Pensacola Bay were heavily used during winter by a large portion of the population. Gulf sturgeon also exhibited long-term winter residency in Santa Rosa Sound for two consecutive years. An area in northeastern Escambia Bay supported Gulf sturgeon during the summer, which was unexpected and can not be explained by the data from this study. However, the discovery that Gulf sturgeon remain in the bay during the summer has important ecological and management implications that need further investigation.					6th International Symposium on Sturgeons6th International Symposium on Sturgeons	OCT 25-30, 2009OCT 25-30, 2009		Wuhan, PEOPLES R CHINAWuhan, PEOPLES R CHINA	1	0	0	1	0	1			0175-8659	1439-0426		WOS:000288864600025

Although seasonal migration of sturgeon is well documented, little information is available pertaining to daily variation in activity. We surgically implanted 58 Gulf sturgeon with acoustic transmitters in the Escambia (n = 26), Yellow (n = 8), Blackwater (n = 12) and Choctawhatchee rivers (n = 12) in June, July, September and October 2005. Gulf sturgeon location was monitored using an array of 56 fixed-station acoustic receivers. The relationship between frequency of Gulf sturgeon observations recorded on all acoustic receivers and time of day for all seasons combined indicated a strong diel activity pattern. Gulf sturgeon were frequently detected at night in all seasons with the exception of summer. Consecutive hourly observations indicated lateral movement of Gulf sturgeon between independent acoustic receivers on 15% of all observations of individuals. The use of an acoustic receiver array not only provides continuous data within a defined area, but also provides insight into nocturnal behavior of Gulf sturgeon not previously identified.					6th International Symposium on Sturgeons6th International Symposium on Sturgeons	OCT 25-30, 2009OCT 25-30, 2009		Wuhan, PEOPLES R CHINAWuhan, PEOPLES R CHINA	2	0	0	2	0	2			0175-8659	1439-0426		WOS:000288864600026

Diploid, and sterile hatchery-reared shortnose sturgeon, and wild shortnose sturgeon showed apparent similar seasonal patterns of movement within the river. We were unable to detect any significant differences in the seasonal mean river location, minimum daily distance moved, absolute distance moved, displacement or mean territory size among treatments. Fish moved throughout the brackish and freshwater interface area of the Savannah River during the summer months. Coinciding with decreasing fall temperatures, fish of all treatment groups moved downriver into brackish areas of the upper estuary, residing in the Front, Middle, and Back Rivers, where they remained through winter. Upriver movements of some hatchery-reared and wild groups began in early February as river temperatures began to increase. Shortnose sturgeon from each group selected apparent similar thermal, salinity and water depth conditions throughout the year. Hatchery-reared fish may be useful as surrogates for wild fish in behavioural studies. Triploid or surgically-sterilized fish may be used in situ behavioural studies where genetic contamination is a concern. It may be possible to monitor habitats used by released hatchery-reared fish to locate or verify remnant populations of rare or endangered species in systems where they are thought to be extirpated.					6th International Symposium on Sturgeons6th International Symposium on Sturgeons	OCT 25-30, 2009OCT 25-30, 2009		Wuhan, PEOPLES R CHINAWuhan, PEOPLES R CHINA	3	0	0	2	0	3			0175-8659	1439-0426		WOS:000288864600047

For safe and reproducible cell direct writing, cell injury due to process-induced external stress must be understood in addition to biological property research. The objective of this study is to model the thermoelastic stress wave propagation inside the coating in laser-assisted cell direct writing when vaporization and/or optical breakdown of coating materials is/are not available. It is found that a bipolar pressure pair, with peak magnitudes on the order of 1 MPa or higher, has been developed within a finite thin coating medium. Shorter duration laser pulses lead to higher thermoelastic stresses. This study will help to understand the photomechanical stress and its relevance with biomaterial damage in laser-assisted cell direct writing.

Recent studies indicate that breast tissue bears GHR and PRLR and that both GH and PRL may impact development or behavior of breast cancer cells. An important facet of human GH (hGH) and human PRL (hPRL) biology is that although hPRL interacts only with hPRLR, hGH binds well to both hGHR and hPRLR. Presently, we investigated potential signaling effects of both hormones in the estrogen receptor-and progesterone receptor-positive human T47D breast cancer cell line. We found that this cell type expresses ample GHR and PRLR and responds well to both hGH and hPRL, as evidenced by activation of the Janus kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 pathway. Immunoprecipitation studies revealed specific GHR-PRLR association in these cells that was acutely enhanced by GH treatment. Although GH caused formation of disulfide-linked and chemically cross-linked GHR dimers in T47D cells, GH preferentially induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PRLR rather than GHR. Notably, both a GHR-specific ligand antagonist (B2036) and a GHR-specific antagonist monoclonal antibody (anti-GHR(ext-mAb)) failed to inhibit GH-induced signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 activation. In contrast, although the non-GHR-specific GH antagonist (G120R) and the PRL antagonist (G129R) individually only partially inhibited GH-induced activation, combined treatment with these two antagonists conferred greater inhibition than either alone. These data indicate that endogenous GHR and PRLR associate (possibly as a GHR-PRLR heterodimer) in human breast cancer cells and that GH signaling in these cells is largely mediated by the PRLR in the context of both PRLR-PRLR homodimers and GHR-PRLR heterodimers, broadening our understanding of how these related hormones and their related receptors may function in physiology and pathophysiology.

J	Huang, Yong; Morehead, Mason								Study of Machining-Induced Microstructure Variations of Nanostructured/Ultrafine-Grained Copper Using XRD								JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MATERIALS AND TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME				133	2					021007	10.1115/1.4003105			APR 2011	2011	Various methods for the production of bulk nanostructured (NS)/ultrafine-grained (UFG) materials have been developed, including equal channel angular extrusion (ECAE), a form of severe plastic deformation. Using an ECAE NS/UFG copper bar as an example, this study has investigated machining-induced workpiece microstructure variation using X-ray diffraction. It has been found that (1) under gentle cutting conditions, there was a 10% increase in the median grain size compared with unmachined ECAE NS/UFG copper bars. Increases in the arithmetic-, area-, and volume-weighted grain sizes were found to be 10%, 8%, and 8%, respectively, and (2) an average 27% drop in the dislocation density was observed between the machined and unmachined ECAE copper bars. The dislocation density was shown to have the most reduction (-39%) at the outer radius of the machined ECAE bar where more heat and/or higher pressure were experienced.

J	Clark, Andrew J.; Higham, Timothy E.								Slipping, sliding and stability: locomotor strategies for overcoming low-friction surfaces								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY				214	8			1369	1378		10.1242/jeb.051136			APR 2011	2011	Legged terrestrial animals must avoid falling while negotiating unexpected perturbations inherent to their structurally complex environments. Among humans, fatal and nonfatal injuries frequently result from slip-induced falls precipitated by sudden unexpected encounters with low-friction surfaces. Although studies using walking human models have identified some causes of falls and mechanisms underlying slip prevention, it is unclear whether these apply to various locomotor speeds and other species. We used high-speed video and inverse dynamics to investigate the locomotor biomechanics of helmeted guinea fowl traversing slippery surfaces at variable running speeds (1.3-3.6 m s(-1)). Falls were circumvented when limb contact angles exceeded 70 deg, though lower angles were tolerated at faster running speeds (>3.0 m s(-1)). These prerequisites permitted a forward shift of the body's center of mass over the limb's base of support, which kept slip distances below 10 cm (the threshold distance for falls) and maximized the vertical ground reaction forces, thus facilitating limb retraction and the conclusion of the stance phase. These postural control strategies for slip avoidance parallel those in humans, demonstrating the applicability of these strategies across locomotor gaits and the potential for guinea fowl as an insightful model for invasive approaches to understanding limb neuromuscular control on slippery surfaces.									14	0	0	10	0	14			0022-0949			WOS:000288696500023	21430214

In this study, we evaluate changes in gene expression of a marine mollusc, the eastern oyster Crassostrea virginica, associated with the physico-chemical conditions and the levels of metals and other contaminants in their environment. The results indicate that transcript signatures can effectively disentangle the complex interactive gene expression responses to the environment and are also capable of disentangling the complex dynamic effects of environmental factors on gene expression. In this context, the mapping of environment to gene and gene to environment is reciprocal and mutually reinforcing. In general, the response of transcripts to the environment is driven by major factors known to affect oyster physiology such as temperature, pH, salinity, and dissolved oxygen, with pollutant levels playing a relatively small role, at least within the range of concentrations found in the studied oyster habitats. Further, the two environmental factors that dominate these effects (temperature and pH) interact in a dynamic and nonlinear fashion to impact gene expression. Transcriptomic data obtained in our study provide insights into the mechanisms of physiological responses to temperature and pH in oysters that are consistent with the known effects of these factors on physiological functions of ectotherms and indicate important linkages between transcriptomics and physiological outcomes. Should these linkages hold in further studies and in other organisms, they may provide a novel integrated approach for assessing the impacts of climate change, ocean acidification and anthropogenic contaminants on aquatic organisms via relatively inexpensive microarray platforms.									74	0	0	72	0	74			0962-1083			WOS:000288705300012	21426432	
J	Vigueira, Patrick A.; Paul, Kimberly S.								Requirement for acetyl-CoA carboxylase in Trypanosoma brucei is dependent upon the growth environment								MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY				80	1			117	132		10.1111/j.1365-2958.2011.07563.x			APR 2011	2011	P>Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of human African trypanosomiasis, possesses two fatty acid synthesis pathways: a major de novo synthesis pathway in the ER and a mitochondrial pathway. The 2-carbon donor for both pathways is malonyl-CoA, which is synthesized from acetyl-CoA by Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). Here, we show that T. brucei ACC shares the same enzyme architecture and moderate similar to 30% identity with yeast and human ACCs. ACC is cytoplasmic and appears to be distributed throughout the cell in numerous puncta distinct from glycosomes and other organelles. ACC is active in both bloodstream and procyclic forms. Reduction of ACC activity by RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in a stage-specific phenotype. In procyclic forms, ACC RNAi resulted in 50-75% reduction in fatty acid elongation and a 64% reduction in growth in low-lipid media. In bloodstream forms, ACC RNAi resulted in a minor 15% decrease in fatty acid elongation and no growth defect in culture, even in low-lipid media. However, ACC RNAi did attenuate virulence in a mouse model of infection. Thus the requirement for ACC in T. brucei is dependent upon the growth environment in two different life cycle stages.									13	0	0	13	0	13			0950-382X	1365-2958		WOS:000288803100008	21306439	
J	Goethals, Paul L.; Cho, Byung Rae								The Development of a Target-Focused Process Capability Index with Multiple Characteristics								QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL				27	3			297	311		10.1002/qre.1120			APR 2011	2011	Within an industrial manufacturing environment, Process Capability Indices (PCIs) enable engineers to assess the process performance and ultimately improve the product quality. Despite the fact that most industrial products manufactured today possess multiple quality characteristics, the vast majority of the literature within this area primarily focuses on univariate measures to assess process capability. One particular univariate index, C(pm), is widely used to account for deviations between the location of the process mean and the target value of a process. While some researchers have sought to develop multivariate analogues of C(pm), modeling the loss in quality associated with multiple quality characteristics continues to remain a challenge. This paper proposes a multivariate PCI that more appropriately estimates quality loss, while offering greater flexibility in conforming to various industrial applications, and maintaining a more realistic approach to assessing process capability.

J	Ordonez, Catalina; Lougheed, Vanessa L.; Gardea-Torresdey, Jorge L.; Bain, Lisa J.								Impact of Metals on Macroinvertebrate Assemblages in the Forgotten Stretch of the Rio Grande								ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY				60	3			426	436		10.1007/s00244-010-9557-7			APR 2011	2011	The objective of this study was to examine how changes in the benthic macroinvertebrate community structure and a variety of abiotic variables, such as conductivity and sediment metal concentrations, are modified along the Forgotten River stretch of the Rio Grande. This stretch receives industrial effluent, raw sewage, and agricultural return flow from the El Paso (TX, USA)-Ciudad Juarez (CHI, Mexico) metroplex and then flows relatively undisturbed for 320 km before its next significant input. The high degree of use, followed by the 320-km undisturbed stretch, makes the Forgotten River a unique study site to examine downstream attenuation of contaminants and other abiotic variables to determine their potential effects on macroinvertebrates. Five different sites along the Forgotten Stretch were sampled over a 2-year period. Metal concentrations were low throughout the stretch and were predominantly correlated to percent sediment organic matter rather than explained spatially. Several sensitive invertebrate species, such as Leptophlebiidae, increased in relative abundance downstream, whereas the percentage of tolerant invertebrates decreased. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling separated the macroinvertebrate communities upstream from those downstream, with the more sensitive species being found predominantly downstream and more tolerant taxa associated upstream. Additionally, there was a distinct seasonal gradient to the community. The most important drivers of the community assemblage appear to be distance downstream and seasonality, as well as water conductivity and concentrations of sediment cadmium, which was the only metal that exceeded protective criteria. This study did not provide evidence of the downstream attenuation of heavy metals in the sediments in the Forgotten Stretch; however, downstream changes in macroinvertebrates toward more sensitive taxa suggests that other, unmeasured contaminants might be affecting biological communities in this isolated stretch of an international waterway.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0090-4341			WOS:000291979500005	20563799	
J	Yang, Haiyan; Xu, Xiao-Bang; Craven, Kim								Development and application of software for the analysis of magnetically induced subsequent fault (MISFault)								ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH				81	4			1024	1035		10.1016/j.epsr.2010.12.004			APR 2011	2011	As an initial electric fault occurs, the fault current would result in a strong magnetic force and torque exerted on the power line conductors. The rotational magnetic torque, in turn, would make the power lines with sags swing and may bring them to close proximity or in contact with one another, causing a subsequent fault. For the analysis of the magnetically induced subsequent fault (MISFault), software has been developed as the end product of a multi-year research project sponsored by Duke Energy Company. The software is capable of predicting the smallest distance between the power line conductors during their swing procedure, from which one can predict the probability of the magnetically induced subsequent fault: and determine the allowed span length range from consideration of eliminating the subsequent fault, which is anticipated to be useful for a utility in long span design. The software has been tested and the accuracy of its computation results has been validated by verifying that the energy conservation law requirement is well satisfied. The MISFault software is being used by Duke Energy Company. It is user friendly and is expected to be useful to a utility for eliminating the magnetically induced subsequent fault.

The intermediates were purified and characterized. Quantitative analysis of the accumulated metabolites from cholesterol side-chain cleavage was conducted during the biotransformation. The results showed that the profile of accumulated intermediates was different from those of other reported microorganisms. Among the five metabolites, androsta-1,4-diene-3,17-dione (ADD) was the main product of the side-chain degradation, with a high conversion rate (87.2%), indicating its potential for industrial production of ADD. At the end of transformation, the substrate cholesterol was completely consumed. The effect of some factors on the bioconversion was also investigated. To our best knowledge, this is the first report regarding cholesterol side-chain cleavage using bacteria belonging to Gordonia.									12	4	0	10	0	16			0959-3993			WOS:000288252400003

IMEs were 2050.5, 1550.5, 1050.5 and 0550.5 possessing lines and spaces that were 20, 15, 10, and 5 mu m respectively; 5 mm line lengths and were 50 lines on each opposing bus. Bioactive hydrogels were synthesized from spun-applied and UV-crosslinked tetraethyleneglycol diacrylate (TEGDA) (crosslinker), 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA), polyethyleneglycol(200) monomethacrylate (PEGMA), N-[tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl]-acrylamide (HMMA) and poly(HEMA) (MW 60,000) (viscosity modifier) and 2,2-dimethoxy-2-phenylacetophenone (DMPA) (photoinitiator) to produce a 5 mu m thick p(HEMA-co-PEGMA-co-HMMA) hydrogel membrane on the IMEs. Unmodified and hydrogel coated IMEs where characterized by AC electrical impedance spectroscopy using 50 mV p-t-p over the frequency range from 10 Hz to 100 kHz in aqueous PBS 7.4 buffer and in buffer containing 50 mM [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-) solution at RT. Impedimetric responses were found to scale with the device geometric parameters. Equivalent circuit modeling revealed deviations from ideality at lower device dimensions suggesting an implication of the substrate surface charge on the double layer capacitance of the electrodes. Diffusion coefficients derived from the Warburg component are in accord with literature values.									21	0	0	8	0	21			1387-2176			WOS:000288169000003	21104321

The lattice disorder was imparted into the nanotubes by the addition of varying amounts of sulfur to the iron catalyst in a thermal chemical vapor deposition process. Changes in the intensities of peaks occurring due to a double resonance Raman process were studied. The intensity of the disorder-induced D band increased with a decrease in the sulfur content. Upon post-synthesis heat treatment, the double resonance process got quenched due to defect healing. The second order G' band and iTOLA bands exhibited a two-peak structure, of which one of the peaks is relatively more sensitive to defects and decreased in intensity with heat treatment.

In this study, several peptides with higher ACE-inhibitory activity were prepared from egg white protein by enzymatic hydrolysis with Alcalase, purified with Sephadex G25, identified by LC/MS/MS and their structure determined by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy.RESULTS: Peptide sequences DHPFLF, HAEIN and QIGLF that showed ACE-inhibitory activity were investigated further for their stability in gastrointestinal solution and for changes in their secondary structure in solution mixtures. QIGLF exhibited the highest activity (IC50 = 75 mu mol L-1) and was resistant to digestion by proteases of the gastrointestinal tract. The CD spectrum of QIGLF showed the presence of the a-helix conformation.CONCLUSION: Three peptides were identified by LC/MS/MS and synthesised by Fmoc solid phase synthesis. Of the three, only the peptide sequence QIGLF was a potential ACE inhibitor, with an IC50 value of 75 mu mol L-1. Moreover, QIGLF showed low gastrointestinal enzyme susceptibility and contained a relatively high amount of a-helix.

Hsein								Rainfall-based criteria for assessing slump rate of mountainous highway slopes: A case study of slopes along Highway 18 in Alishan, Taiwan								ENGINEERING GEOLOGY				118	3-4			63	74		10.1016/j.enggeo.2011.01.001			MAR 24 2011	2011	A data-driven approach is considered in the present to investigate the relationship between the precipitation (rainfall) and the slump rate of highway slopes along Highway 18 in Alishan, Taiwan. The basis for the analysis presented herein is a set of 103 slope failure records collected from the study area, where each record consists of entries for daily rainfall, effective rainfall and other topographical and geological factors. To begin with, Artificial Evolution Neural Network (AENN), a data-driven approach, is first used to learn from past slope failure records. The results show that the developed AENN can accurately predict the occurrence of slope failure with a success rate of 99%. Then, this AENN model is employed to study the slump rate of slopes in the study area, and the computational results show that the slump rate can be accurately assessed based on the precipitation data that consists of daily rainfall and effective rainfall. A rainfall-based criterion is further developed as an early warning indicator for accelerated slump rate of slopes in the study area. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In this research, our objective was to further sequence and develop common bean microsatellites from leaf and root cDNA libraries derived from the Andean gene pool accession G19833 and the Mesoamerican gene pool accession DOR364, mapping parents of a commonly used reference map. The root libraries were made from high and low phosphorus treated plants.Results: A total of 3,123 EST sequences from leaf and root cDNA libraries were screened and used for direct simple sequence repeat discovery. From these EST sequences we found 184 microsatellites; the majority containing tri-nucleotide motifs, many of which were GC rich (ACC, AGC and AGG in particular). Di-nucleotide motif microsatellites were about half as common as the tri-nucleotide motif microsatellites but most of these were AG(n) microsatellites with a moderate number of AT(n) microsatellites in root ESTs followed by few AC(n) and no GC(n) microsatellites. Out of the 184 new SSR loci, 120 new microsatellite markers were developed in the BMc (Bean Microsatellites from cDNAs) series and these were evaluated for their capacity to distinguish bean diversity in a germplasm panel of 18 genotypes. We developed a database with images of the microsatellites and their polymorphism information content (PIC), which averaged 0.310 for polymorphic markers.Conclusions: The present study produced information about microsatellite frequency in root and leaf tissues of two important genotypes for common bean genomics: namely G19833, the Andean genotype selected for whole genome shotgun sequencing from race Peru, and DOR364 a race Mesoamerica subgroup 2 genotype that is a small-red seeded, released variety in Central America. Both race Peru and Mesoamerica subgroup 2 (small red beans) have been understudied in comparison to race Nueva Granada and Mesoamerica subgroup 1 (black beans) both with regards to gene expression and as sources of markers. However, we found few differences between SSR type and frequency between the G19833 leaf and DOR364 root tissue-derived ESTs. Overall, our work adds to the analysis of microsatellite frequency evaluation for common bean and provides a new set of 120 BMc markers which combined with the 248 previously developed BMc markers brings the total in this series to 368 markers. Once we include BMd markers, which are derived from GenBank sequences, the current total of gene-based markers from our laboratory surpasses 500 markers. These markers are basic for studies of the transcriptome of common bean and can form anchor points for genetic mapping studies in the future.									34	3	0	34	2	37			1471-2229			WOS:000288945600001	21426554

Analysis and design of a wideband lumped-element quadrature directional coupler for complementary metal-oxide semiconductor implementation								IET MICROWAVES ANTENNAS & PROPAGATION				5	4			443	449		10.1049/iet-map.2010.0440			MAR 21 2011	2011	This study proposes a new wide band quadrature coupler structure using a lumped-element technique. The theoretical operating conditions of the proposed structure are also analysed. The operating bandwidth is extended and the phase shift difference error is reduced by introducing two matching frequency points. When the designed centre frequency is 6 GHz, a theoretical calculation shows that the operating bandwidth is 2 GHz and the phase shift error ranges from -5.9 to 1.76 degrees. A coupler with 6 GHz centre frequency is also designed in a 0.13 mu m CMOS process and simulated using Cadence Spectre. The active area of the coupler is 560 mu m x 640 mu m. The post-layout simulation shows that the operating bandwidth has strong tolerance to the process variations.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1751-8725			WOS:000288785200009		
J	Chantrasa, Amornmart; Phlernjai, Nisarat; Goodwin, James G., Jr.								Kinetics of hydrotalcite catalyzed transesterification of tricaprylin and methanol for biodiesel synthesis								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL				168	1			333	340		10.1016/j.cej.2011.01.033			MAR 15 2011	2011	Currently, biodiesel is a well-known alternative diesel fuel that can be derived from transesterification or esterification. This work focused on the transesterification of tricaprylin (TCP) and methanol (MeOH) on solid base hydrotalcite catalyst in order to investigate the reaction kinetics in the temperature range of 60 degrees C and 120 degrees C and 15:1 molar ratio of MeOH to TCP in a well-mixed batch reactor. The apparent activation energy obtained over this reaction temperature range was 38.4 kJ/mol. This value was proved to be without the effect from catalyst deactivation and the presence of hexane solvent, as well as the mass transport limitation. The power law rate expression showed that the reaction orders with respect to the TCP and methanol were 0.70 and 1.92, respectively, at 60 degrees C of reaction temperature while they were 0.54 and 1.10 at 120 degrees C. An Eley-Rideal mechanism was employed to explain the power law rate expression at 120 degrees C of reaction temperature. Along with the reactant-catalyst pre-contacting experiment, it can be concluded that the reaction started with methanol adsorption on a single basic site and then the reaction between adsorbed methanol and tricaprylin from liquid phase with surface reaction as the rate determining step. On the other hand, bimolecular pathway was used to explain the reaction mechanism at 60 degrees C of reaction temperature since the reaction order with respect to methanol was close to 2. In addition, catalyst deactivation was observed when the catalyst was used in two successive reaction cycles, especially after being used at high temperature. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J	Andrukh, Taras; Rubin, Binyamin; Kornev, Konstantin G.								Wire-in-a-Nozzle as a New Droplet-on-Demand Electrogenerator								LANGMUIR				27	6			3206	3210		10.1021/la104855b			MAR 15 2011	2011	Many engineering applications assume the generation of single spherical droplets on demand. Piezo and thermo droplet-on-demand (DOD) instruments are not able to produce droplets with a broad range of size distributions from the same nozzle. We show that this challenge can be resolved using the principles of electrostatic generation and capillarity. A thin conductive wire threaded through a needle can be used as the droplet electrogenerator (or DOD generator). By applying a weak-bias electric field, one can deliver a drop from the needle edge to the free wire tip. When the drop moves toward the wire tip, it leaves behind a thin coating film. The capillary pressure of this cylindrical film helps isolate the droplet from the liquid source: the film spontaneously thins, breaking the connection between the droplet and the liquid source. The detachment of a pendant drop from the wire is then achieved by applying a short voltage pulse. Using the wire-in-a-needle nozzle, we were able to produce single droplets ranging from 50 to 500 mu m, and we were able to deposit them with controlled velocity in a prescribed position. Therefore, the proposed method offers new opportunities in fields dealing with the DOD applications.									7	0	0	2	0	7			0743-7463			WOS:000288039500149	21332228

However, most previous studies of this have been performed using conditions not relevant to fuel cell environments, and very few investigations have studied the effect of Nation decomposition on conductivity, one of the most crucial factors governing PEMFC performance. In this study, a quantitative examination of properties and conductivities of degraded Nation membranes at conditions relevant to fuel cell environments (30-100%RH and 80 degrees C) was performed. Nafion membranes were pre-ion-exchanged with small amounts of Fe2+ ions prior to H2O2 exposure. The degradation degree (defined as loss of ion-exchange capacity, weight, and fluoride content), water uptake, and conductivity of H2O2-exposed membranes were found to strongly depend on Fe content and H2O2 treatment time. SEM cross-sections showed that the degradation initially took place in the center of the membrane, while FTIR analysis revealed that Nafion degradation preferentially proceeds at the sulfonic end group and at the ether linkage located in the pendant side chain and that the H-bond of water is weakened after prolonged H2O2 exposure.

The effect of shear rate was characterized on the mechanical, barrier, and structural properties of nanocomposites. Elongation at break (EAB) was unaffected by shear rate, which decreased after homogenization, increased above 13,000 rpm, however, tensile strength (TS) dramatically increased up to 59 MPa at 16,000 rpm. Water vapor permeability (WVP) and oxygen permeability (OP) of the homogenized nanocomposite decreased more than that of untreated nanocomposite and OP was not significantly changed above 16,000 rpm of shear rate. XRD result and TEM images indicated that three types of tactoids, exfoliation, and intercalation were generated and the largest distance of 18.87 angstrom between MMT-Na(+) layers was produced at 16,000 rpm. The results indicate that homogenization was a beneficial method for effectively dispersing MMT-Na(+) layers in a chitosan polymer matrix and that a shear rate of 16,000 rpm was the effective condition.

Recently, from our detailed magnetization studies and ab initio calculations, we attributed this FM ordering in nanostructured ZnO to the presence of surface states, and a direct correlation between the magnetic properties and crystallinity of ZnO was observed. In this study, through a systematic sample preparation of both pristine and Co-doped ZnO nanostructures, and detailed magnetization and nonlinear optical (NLO) measurements, we confirm that the observed FM ordering is due to the presence of surface states.									16	0	0	1	0	16			0957-4484			WOS:000286622000016	21258145

Molecular Characterization and Phylogenetic Analysis of Hoplolaimus stephanus								JOURNAL OF NEMATOLOGY				43	1			25	34					MAR 2011	2011	Three Hoplolaimus stephanus populations were characterized morphologically, both by morphometrics and by SEM observations. These populations were used to develop a rapid and accurate molecular identification method for the species, which is useful because of the high level of morphological similarity between H. stephanus and H. galeatus. Species-specific primers for H. stephanus, amplifying a distinct fragment (260 bp) of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer1 (ITS1), can be used in multiplex PCR along with previously developed primers for other common Hoplolaimus species. We also infer phylogenetic relationships among H. stephanus, the closely-related H. galeatus, and several other Hoplolaimus species, using sequences of the actin gene, ITS1 and LSUD.									3	0	0	2	0	3			0022-300X			WOS:000300530200004	22791912

J	Tessendorf, Jerry								Angular smoothing and spatial diffusion from the Feynman path integral representation of radiative transfer								JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER				112	4	SI		751	760		10.1016/j.jqsrt.2010.11.004			MAR 2011	2011	The propagation kernel for time dependent radiative transfer is represented by a Feynman path integral (FPI). The FPI is approximately evaluated in the spatial-Fourier domain. Spatial diffusion is exhibited in the kernel when the approximations lead to a Gaussian dependence on the Fourier domain wave vector. The approximations provide an explicit expression for the diffusion matrix. They also provide an asymptotic criterion for the self-consistency of the diffusion approximation. The criterion is weakly violated in the limit of large numbers of scattering lengths. Additional expansion of higher-order terms may resolve whether this weak violation is significant.

The Price Effects of Using Firewalls as an Antitrust Remedy								REVIEW OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION				38	2			209	222		10.1007/s11151-011-9282-z			MAR 2011	2011	Antitrust authorities have imposed firewalls between the previously separate divisions of newly vertically integrated firms in several industries, to address concerns that access to horizontal rivals' proprietary information may reduce competition. This paper evaluates a specific antitrust concern by modeling the price effect of one seller's learning its rival's production costs before bidding in a duopoly procurement contest. The results show that imposing a firewall as a condition for permitting a vertical merger actually can lead to higher prices than if the flow of information were unimpeded, and they provide guidance as to when this unintended outcome occurs.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0889-938X			WOS:000288900400006

An Observation of a Partially Albinistic Zenaida macroura (Mourning Dove)								SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST				10	1			185	188		10.1656/058.010.0117			MAR 2011	2011	Three of the 4 forms of albinism that occur in avifauna have been detected in Zenaida macroura (Mourning Dove). Albinism is rare in this species, and the incidence rate of each age and sex cohort is not well known. Consequently, we examined the pigmentation of Mourning Doves encountered in the Coastal Plain of South Carolina, and classified the age and sex of all individuals. One adult male Mourning Dove had unusually light coloration of some feathers and the upper mandible. This pigmentation is consistent with partial albinism. This was the only individual out of 10,749 examined that appeared to be albinistic. This low incidence rate of albinism supports the conclusion that this condition is relatively rare in Mourning Doves (Mirarchi 1993).									2	0	0	3	0	3			1528-7092			WOS:000306600900017

Laboratory Investigation of Fatigue Characteristics of Rubberized Asphalt Mixtures Containing Warm Asphalt Additives at a Low Temperature								JOURNAL OF TESTING AND EVALUATION				39	2			290	295		10.1520/JTE102844			MAR 2011	2011	The fatigue life of an asphalt pavement is directly related to various factors of a typical warm mix asphalt (WMA) mixture. Improving the understanding of the fatigue behavior of the rubberized WMA mixtures is helpful in recycling the scrap tires and saving energy. This study explores the utilization of the conventional fatigue analysis approach in investigating the cumulative dissipated energy, stiffness, and fatigue life of rubberized asphalt concrete mixtures containing WMA additives. The fatigue beams were made with one rubber type (-40 mesh ambient crumb rubber), two aggregate sources, two WMA additives (Asphamin and Sasobit), and tested at 5 degrees C. The test results indicated that the addition of crumb rubber and WMA additive not only reduced the mixing and compaction temperatures of rubberized asphalt mixtures offset by crumb rubber but also slightly extended the long-term performance of pavement when compared with conventional asphalt mixtures.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0090-3973	1945-7553		WOS:000296596200021		
J	Thomas, Charles J.								Vertical mergers in procurement markets								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION				29	2			200	209		10.1016/j.ijindorg.2010.05.001			MAR 2011	2011	This paper uses computational methods that reveal ambiguous strategic effects of vertical mergers in a duopoly setting featuring incomplete information about sellers' costs, and differences in sellers' productive capabilities. First, vertical mergers can be jointly unprofitable. Second, the buyer's preferred merger partner is almost always the seller with lower expected costs, and is typically the larger seller. Third, vertical mergers always reduce the unintegrated seller's profits, sometimes dramatically. Finally, vertical mergers can increase total welfare. Some of the results contrast qualitatively with unambiguous findings from models with symmetric sellers, which suggests that caution should be used in drawing general inferences from those models.

J	Mityakov, Sergey V.								SPECIAL INTERESTS AND FINANCIAL LIBERALIZATION: THE CASE OF MEXICO								ECONOMICS & POLITICS				23	1			1	35		10.1111/j.1468-0343.2010.00368.x			MAR 2011	2011	Financial liberalization is often believed to enhance economic growth. Yet in many cases a few powerful incumbents seem to capture most of the gains from the reform. In this paper, I construct a model with endogenous formation of special interest groups that could reap most of the benefits of financial liberalization. In particular, these groups lobby to limit entry by other firms, while taking advantage of improved borrowing opportunities. I then use the model to study the Mexican financial liberalization of 1988. Analysis of firm-level panel data on manufacturing plants reveals patterns suggested by the model. Specifically, large firms in more concentrated or more corrupt sectors benefit more from liberalization. In addition, domestically owned firms gain more than firms with foreign ownership. I also propose a new way to measure corruption at the industry level based on the Mexican 10% profit sharing rule.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0954-1985			WOS:000294307000001

We find that the high curvature in sub-nm SWCNTs leads to (i) an unusual S-like dispersion of the G-band frequency due to perturbations caused by the strong electron-phonon coupling, (ii) an activation of diameter-selective intermediate frequency modes that are as intense as the radial breathing modes (RBMs), and (iii) a clear observation of the IR modes. Furthermore, an analytical approach which includes the effects of curvature into the overlap integral and the energy gap between the van Hove singularities is discussed. Lastly, we show that the phonon spectra for sub-nm SWCNTs obtained from the molecular dynamic simulations which employs a curvature-dependent force field concur with our experimental observations.

He, Yong/F-8752-2012				Multi-length scale modeling and analysis of microstructure evolution and mechanical properties in polyurea								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE				46	6			1767	1779		10.1007/s10853-010-4998-y			MAR 2011	2011	A number of experimental investigations reported in the open literature have indicated that polyurea possesses a very complex nanometer-scale material microstructure consisting of hydrogen-bonded discrete hard (high glass-transition temperature, T-g) domains and a soft (low T-g) matrix and that the mechanical properties of this type of elastomer are highly dependent on the details of this microstructure. To help elucidate the internal processes/mechanisms associated with the microstructure evolution and to improve the understanding of microstructure/properties in this material, a multi-length scale approach is developed and utilized in the present work. This approach combines well-established and validated atomic, meso, and continuum length-scale techniques and spans around six orders of magnitude of length (from nanometers to millimeters). While within the atomic-scale approach, the material is modeled as a collection of constituent atom-size particles, within the meso-scale approach this atomistic description of the material is replaced with a collection of coarser particles/beads which account for the collective degrees of freedom of the constituent atoms. One of the main efforts in the present work was the derivation of accurate input parameters for meso-scale simulations from the associated atomic-scale material model and results. The meso-scale analysis provided critical information regarding the material microstructure and its evolution (from an initially fully blended homogeneous state). To obtain quantitative relationships between material microstructure and its mechanical properties, the computed meso-scale material microstructures are combined with a finite element approach. The predictions of the present multi-scale computational approach are found to be in good overall agreement with their experimental counterparts.									28	0	0	0	0	28			0022-2461			WOS:000286632600027

This definition of arrival time is not the same as the one in [8, 12]; it eliminates pathological discontinuities that can occur with the older definition and is still consistent with physical intuition. What is substantively new here is that we show that the newly defined arrival time is locally Lipschitz-continuous. Then following the method in [8, 12] we establish that it satisfies the eikonal equation. Furthermore, in the isotropic case we establish that the arrival time, as defined here, is the unique viscosity solution of the eikonal equation. Our motivation for this work is to use this arrival time at points in the interior of a physical or biological material, which is estimated from displacement measurements, to determine properties of the medium that are represented as functions in the eikonal equation; see [8, 10, 11, 12].

The purpose of this study was to examine the ability of endothelial cells (ECs) seeded on novel elastin heparin scaffolds to resist detachment on exposure to physiological levels of shear stress and to evaluate whether these cells maintain a quiescent profile on these scaffolds by investigating the expression of thrombomodulin (TM) and adhesive molecules platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). To evaluate the functional response of the cultured endothelium on injury, the cellular response (ICAM-1 expression) to physiological stimulatory factor tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was analyzed. The ECs formed a confluent monolayer expressing PECAM-1 and TM very similar to native aortic ECs. ICAM-1 expression was slightly higher than that observed on tissue culture polystyrene (TOPS), but was similar to that seen on several other polymers. Furthermore, the cells responded to stimulation by TNF-alpha (expression of ICAM was elevated by similar to 30%). These results indicate that the ECs seeded on elastin heparin scaffolds express normal EC molecules and may provide an efficient anti-thrombogenic surface for these tissue-engineered vascular grafts.									0	1	0	0	0	1			0147-8885			WOS:000289589500002

In a traditional approach, scaffolds are seeded with stem cells and subjected to stimuli in bioreactors that mimic physiologic conditions or are directly implanted into target sites in animal models. The expected results are significant cell changes, extensive remodeling of the scaffolds and creation of surrogate structures that would be deemed acceptable for tissue regeneration. Histochemical techniques are increasingly becoming essential tools in tissue engineering research. In our studies, we used lectin and antibody-based techniques to characterize novel collagen and elastin scaffolds and to ensure efficient removal of xenoantigens. Scaffolds were implanted in animals and infiltrated host cells were identified using antibodies to activated fibroblasts, macrophages, and lymphocytes. Stem cell-seeded scaffolds were subjected to mechanical strains and tested for differentiation into cardiovascular cells using antibody-based double immunofluorescence methods. Finally, living heart valves were constructed from scaffolds and stem cells, subjected to conditioning in a bioreactor and stem cell differentiation evaluated by immunofluorescence. Overall, these techniques have proven to be outstanding companions to biochemical, molecular biology and cell analysis methods used in tissue engineering research and development.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0147-8885			WOS:000289589500003	25620822

Several jurisdictions within the United States have opted to allow four and five stories if sprinklers are present. This paper presents a comprehensive numerical analysis of a six-story wood-frame building designed on the basis of the 2006 IBC methodology and a building designed by using the direct-displacement design (DDD) approach. The objectives of the design methods are different and are explained herein. Incremental dynamic analysis (IDA) was used to numerically investigate the response of the buildings on the basis of two criteria: the peak interstory drift and the building's base shear capacity. Gypsum wall board was included in both models, but exterior finishes (e.g., stucco) were not. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CF.1943-5509.0000150.

This is a controversial area and indeed, our end conclusions are opposite of those made in Dr. Kelvin Droegemeier's July 28, 2009 Senate testimonial. The methods developed here should help rigorize the debate. Elaborating, we develop a level-alpha test for a changepoint in a categorical data sequence sampled from a multinomial distribution. The proposed test statistic is the maximum of correlated Pearson chi-square statistics. This test statistic is linked to cumulative sum statistics and its null hypothesis asymptotic distribution is derived in terms of the supremum of squared Brownian bridges. The methods are used to identify changes in the tropical cyclone record in the North Atlantic Basin over the period 1851-2008. We find changepoints in both the storm frequencies and their strengths (wind speeds). The changepoint in wind speed is not found with standard cumulative sum mean shift changepoint methods, hence providing a dataset where categorical probabilities shift but means do not. While some of the identified shifts can be attributed to changes in data collection techniques, the hotly debated changepoint in cyclone frequency circa 1995 also appears to be significant.									17	0	0	1	0	17			0162-1459			WOS:000289871200008

Standard finite element schemes for NS-alpha suffer from two major sources of error if their solutions are considered approximations to true fluid flow: (1) the consistency error arising from filtering; and (2) the dramatic effect of the large pressure error on the velocity error that arises from the (necessary) use of the rotational form nonlinearity. The proposed scheme "fixes" these two numerical issues through the combined use of a modified grad-div stabilization that acts in both the momentum and filter equations, and an adapted approximate deconvolution technique designed to work with the altered filter. We prove the scheme is stable, optimally convergent, and the effect of the pressure error on the velocity error is significantly reduced. Several numerical experiments are given that demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.									16	0	0	0	0	16			0764-583X	1290-3841		WOS:000289621800005

Biochip/laser cell deposition system to assess polarized axonal growth from single neurons and neuron/glia pairs in microchannels with novel asymmetrical geometries								BIOMICROFLUIDICS				5	1					013408	10.1063/1.3552998			MAR 2011	2011	Axon path-finding plays an important role in normal and pathogenic brain development as well as in neurological regenerative medicine. In both scenarios, axonal growth is influenced by the microenvironment including the soluble molecules and contact-mediated signaling from guiding cells and cellular matrix. Microfluidic devices are a powerful tool for creating a microenvironment at the single cell level. In this paper, an asymmetrical-channel-based biochip, which can be later incorporated into microfluidic devices for neuronal network study, was developed to investigate geometric as well as supporting cell control of polarized axonal growth in forming a defined neuronal circuitry. A laser cell deposition system was used to place single cells, including neuron-glia pairs, into specific microwells of the device, enabling axonal growth without the influence of cytophilic/phobic surface patterns. Phase microscopy showed that a novel "snag" channel structure influenced axonal growth in the intended direction 4:1 over the opposite direction. In heterotypic experiments, glial cell influence over the axonal growth path was observed with time-lapse microscopy. Thus, it is shown that single cell and heterotypic neuronal path-finding models can be developed in laser patterned biochips. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

J	Stafford, Marla B. Royne; Reilly, Tim; Grove, Stephen J.; Carlson, Les; Bhandari, Rishi; Copeland, John								The Evolution of Services Advertising in a Services-Driven National Economy An Analysis of Progress and Missed Opportunities								JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING RESEARCH				51	1			136	152		10.2501/JAR-51-1-136-152		S	MAR 2011	2011	With services continuing to dominate the gross domestic product, the marketing and advertising of services remain a core issue in the discipline. Because of their generally intangible nature, however, services often face unique challenges in developing effective and appropriate advertising strategies. Given the importance of promotional decisions to service practitioners, an assessment of the current literature guiding services-advertising decisions is important. In 1997, Carolyn Tripp published an overview of the services-advertising literature covering a 15-year period corresponding to services-marketing's emergence and early development. Her overall conclusion was that the services-advertising literature lagged behind the services-marketing field in general. As a result, she proposed several specific areas that needed attention and suggestions for enhancing the quality of research on services advertising. In this paper, we provide an update to this research by identifying, classifying, and analyzing articles on services advertising that have been published since 1997. Although a number of services-advertising articles seem to have heeded Tripp's various concerns, there is still much to be done on the topic. Hence, we provide additional direction for needed areas of research in the area of services advertising.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0021-8499			WOS:000288688300011

For this purpose, we regress indicators of educational and occupational achievement in early adulthood on predictors measured three and six years earlier. The Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study, used for the analysis, allows us to establish a clear temporal order among exogenous predictors and the two dependent variables. We also construct a Downward Assimilation Index, based on six indicators and regress it on the same set of predictors. Results confirm a pattern of segmented assimilation in the second generation, with a significant proportion of the sample experiencing downward assimilation. Predictors of the latter are the obverse of those of educational and occupational achievement. Significant interaction effects emerge between these predictors and early school contexts, defined by different class and racial compositions. Implications of these results for theory and policy are examined.									48	0	0	1	0	48			0037-7732			WOS:000288883300001

Using the empirical example of weight loss, I analyze how individuals evolve from an identity as ''fat'' and stigmatized to one that is ''normal'' with respect to weight and free from identification with stigmatizing self-labels. The results suggest that stigma exits are possible but not easy and that simply sustaining weight loss over time does not necessarily produce an exit from stigma. Instead, stigma exits require evolutions in the responses of significant others and shifts in the way exiters view themselves. Moreover, individuals vary in the intensity of their identification with stigma and this is associated with the kinds of obstacles they find most troublesome as they attempt to exit stigma. Finally, I discuss the application of these findings to theories of structural symbolic interaction and to other forms of stigma.									17	0	0	1	0	17			0190-2725			WOS:000289175100004

This study examined patterns of and factors associated with recidivism. The sample. included 5,435 juveniles with disabilities. Findings indicated intragroup variability regarding the number of referrals and the percentages of adolescents who were adjudicated, had a record of determinate commitment, and had a record of probation. African American males who were from delinquent families tended to have more referrals than adolescents from poorer families with fewer family problems. There is a need to examine further the reasons why certain groups of adolescents with disabilities are more likely to become recidivists and a need to develop intervention strategies that are effective in reducing juvenile offenses committed by these groups. A promising intervention that may ameliorate the effects of family criminal history involves the implementation of wraparound and family empowerment services.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0014-4029			WOS:000287979400003

The protocols do not require channel measurements or pilot signals; instead, the receiver derives the necessary adaptation control information from its decoder during of the reception of each packet. The throughput achieved by each adaptive-coding protocol when it is used with a family of turbo product codes is compared with the capacity limit and with the throughput that is obtained from a hypothetical ideal protocol that is given perfect channel state information.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0090-6778			WOS:000288683000029

J	Carter, Michelle; Grover, Varun; Thatcher, Jason Bennett								THE EMERGING CIO ROLE OF BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY STRATEGIST								MIS QUARTERLY EXECUTIVE				10	1			19	29					MAR 2011	2011	This article focuses on the emerging CIO role of business technology strategist and its relationship with the three traditional IT management roles-informational, decisional, and interpersonal. Our starting assumption was that two characteristics of a CIO may also influence his or her ability to perform this emerging role: 1) the formal power derived from the CIO's reporting level and 2) the CIO's technical background (technical education and experience). Based on a field study of 45 CIOs, we find that the role of business technology strategist is most strongly related to the CIO's formal power and to his or her skills in absorbing and disseminating relevant information (the informational role). A technical background (technical credibility) is more important for the performance of the other two traditional roles (decisional and interpersonal), which are focused on managing IT resources. These findings on multiple CIO roles therefore help to reconcile a debate in the practitioner literature about how best to leverage CIOs as business technology strategists. CIOs who report to the CEO or a CxO will take an "outside-in" approach that leverages their access to top management. In contrast, in firms that have placed a less strategic focus on IT, CIOs with less formal power will take an "inside-out" approach that leverages their strong technical expertise and effective management of IT resources.									10	0	0	0	0	10			1540-1960			WOS:000288207900002		
J	Rick, Allison R.; Arai, Yuji								Role of Natural Nanoparticles in Phosphorus Transport Processes in Ultisols								SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL				75	2			335	347		10.2136/sssaj2010.0124nps			MAR-APR 2011	2011	Labile P is a well-recognized nonpoint source pollutant in agroecosystems. Predicting the fate and transport of P in watershed systems is critical in protecting water quality. In this case study, we investigated the role of soil nanoparticles in P release in South Carolina agricultural soils. Batch desorption experiments were coupled with scanning and transmission electron microscopy (EM) and x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to better assess the reactivity of soil nanoparticles. The surface soils contained a total P concentration of 260 to 940 mg kg(-1), approximately 40 to 60% of which was ammonium oxalate extractable P. The 30-d desorption experiments showed that P desorption was initially rapid, followed by a slow continuous release at pH 5.5 and 7. It was generally not correlated with the release of soil nanoparticles (operationally defined as 10-200 nm). Phosphorus was not readily retained on these nanoparticles at pH 4 to 7. These nanoparticles were rich in Si and S, and coated with Fe and C and trace amounts of P, Ca, Na, Mg, and Al. The EM images of nanoparticle morphology showed C-associated globular formations as well as assembled platelets and spherical nanoparticles. The colloid- and nanoparticle-facilitated P release has often been suggested as one of the important pathways for P transport in the soil-water environment. This study presents a new aspect of nanoparticle reactivity in the soil environment, however: nanoparticles do not always contribute to P transport processes.									12	1	0	12	0	12			0361-5995	1435-0661		WOS:000288827000002		
J	Farajpour, Ismail								A coordinate descent based method for geometry optimization of trusses								ADVANCES IN ENGINEERING SOFTWARE				42	3			64	75		10.1016/j.advengsoft.2010.12.001			MAR 2011	2011	The main objective of the structure optimization is to reduce the manufacturing cost of the structure. However, economical design should not deviate from engineering restrictions and laws. Based on this concept, various methods have been invented to optimize structures. In this research, some variations in one of the very simple and primary methods called "coordinate descent" or "successive coordinate search" is used for geometry optimization of the trusses. In order to increase the optimization speed and decrease the solution time of the problem, fast matrix analysis methods has been employed leading to reduction of the time required for calculating of the objective function. Furthermore, an optimized solution seeking algorithm has been introduced. In this algorithm, some factors have been defined by which the relation between the optimization time and these factors have been calculated, both experimentally and mathematically and the appropriate values of these factors are obtained to reduce the optimization time. Moreover, the effect of increasing the accuracy of the optimum solution on the number of analyses has been studied. Analysis of the presented method shows that regardless of its simplicity, it can be utilized as a fast method for optimizing variety of structures. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The goal was to determine whether student perceptions changed over the course of a summer session regarding verbal, visual, tactile, and web-based teaching methodologies. Pretest and post-test surveys were distributed online to students who volunteered to participate in the pilot study. Despite the relatively small sample size, statistically significant results indicated that PT and OT students who participated in this study perceived an improved ability to name major anatomical structures from memory, to draw major anatomical structures from memory, and to explain major anatomical relationships from memory. Students differed in their preferred learning styles. This study demonstrates that the combination of small group learning and digital web-based learning seems to increase PT and OT students' confidence in their anatomical knowledge. Further research is needed to determine which forms of integrated instruction lead to improved student performance in the human gross anatomy laboratory. Anat Sci Educ 4:71-77.

J	Punith, V. S.; Veeraragavan, A.								Characterization of OGFC Mixtures Containing Reclaimed Polyethylene Fibers								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING				23	3			335	341		10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0000162			MAR 2011	2011	Open-graded friction course (OGFC) mixture is a special purpose mixture that is being increasingly used in pavement surfacing around the world. OGFC mixtures consist of an open gradation, mostly of coarse size aggregate with little fines. Asphalt contents for OGFC mixtures are generally slightly higher than for dense-graded mixtures. This paper deals with the viability of using reclaimed polyethylene (PE) fibers derived from low-density polyethylene (LDPE) tote bags collected from domestic waste as an additive in OGFC mixtures. Draindown test results indicated that OGFC mixtures with PE fibers can be effectively used to retard draindown of the binder and mineral filler. Mixture designs were performed for a range of 4.5-6.0% asphalt content. Laboratory tests were carried out on OGFC mixtures to determine the resistance to fatigue damage, unaged and aged abrasion, tensile strength, moisture-induced damage, and plastic deformation. The test results indicated that OGFC mixtures with reclaimed PE fibers showed improvement in tensile strength and improved resistance to permanent deformation, fatigue-induced damage, and moisture susceptibility when compared with mixtures without fibers.

J	Gaines, William A.; Marcotte, William R., Jr.								Recombinant Dragline Silk-Like Proteins-Expression and Purification								AATCC REVIEW				11	2			75	79					MAR-APR 2011	2011	Spider dragline silk is a proteinaceous fiber with impressive physical characteristics making it attractive for use in advanced materials. The fiber is composed of two proteins (spidroins MaSp1 and MaSp2), each of which contains a large central repeat array flanked by non-repetitive N- and C-terminal domains. The repeat arrays appear to be largely responsible for the tensile properties of the fiber, suggesting that the N- and C-terminal domains may be involved in self-assembly. We recently isolated the MaSp1 and MaSp2 N-terminal domains from Nephila clavipes and have incorporated these into mini-silk genes for expression in transgenic systems. Current efforts involve the development of expression vectors that will allow purification using a removable affinity tag for scalable protein purification.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1532-8813			WOS:000288363600012	23914141

Comparison between this new material and literature sources revealed that it belongs to an undescribed species, Armodoris anudeorum. Although this new species is externally very similar to Armodoris antarctica (the only previously known species of Armodoris), these two species differ in several details of their external morphology, and particularly in their reproductive anatomy and radular morphology. This is the second known species of Armodoris; thus, this paper doubles the known diversity of this exclusively Antarctic group.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0722-4060			WOS:000288349800015

The loading efficiency was approximately 80%, and the zeta potential of the microspheres became more positively charged as the molar ratio of the chitosan amino group was increased. The particles were confirmed to have a spherical shape by optical microscopy. A release test using simulated gastric fluid (SGF) was also performed. The results show that the precipitants were gradually released from the CS-gamma-PGA microspheres at a rate of almost 80% after 60 min. Both the inhibition of Helicobacter pylori growth and the anti-adhesive activity of encapsulated precipitants were maintained after exposure to SGF. These results indicate that CS-gamma-PGA microspheres may provide a delivery system for the effective eradication of H. pylori. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

This technique integrated a computer with a device capable of 3D movement allowing for precise motion and control over the polymer scaffold resolution. IVD scaffold structures were designed using computer-aided design to resemble the natural IVD structure. Degradable polyurethane (PU) was used as an elastic scaffold construct to mimic the elastic nature of the native IVD tissue and was deposited at a controlled rate using ultra-fine micropipettes connected to a syringe pump. The elastic PU was extruded directly onto a collecting substrate placed on a freezing stage. The three-dimensional movement of the computer-controlled device combined with the freezing stage enabled precise control of polymer deposition using extrusion. The addition of the freezing stage increased the polymer solution viscosity and hardened the polymer solution as it was extruded out of the micropipette tip. This technique created scaffolds with excellent control over macro- and micro-structure to influence cell behavior, specifically for cell adhesion, proliferation, and alignment. Concentric lamellae were printed at a high resolution to mimic the native shape and structure of the IVD. Seeded cells aligned along the concentric lamellae and acquired cell morphology similar to native tissue in the outer portion of the IVD. The fabricated scaffolds exhibited elastic behavior during compressive and shear testing, proving that the scaffolds could support loads with proper fatigue resistance without permanent deformation. Additionally, the mechanical properties of the scaffolds were comparable to those of native IVD tissue.									9	3	0	4	0	12			1758-5082			WOS:000288025100005	21343634	
J	Conner, William H.; Song, Bo; Williams, Thomas M.; Vernon, Jeffery T.								Long-term tree productivity of a South Carolina coastal plain forest across a hydrology gradient								JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY				4	1-2	SI		67	76		10.1093/jpe/rtq036			MAR 2011	2011	In recent years, there has been an increased interest in examining changes in forest systems in response to drought, flooding, hurricanes and climate change. In the southern United States, forested wetlands are of special interest because of the extent of these forests. Coastal plain forested wetlands are among the most vulnerable to these climatic impacts. One of the problems in developing management practices for these coastal areas is the difficulty in adequately describing productivity relations and predicting how the structure and function of these communities might be affected by natural or anthropogenic disturbances. Community response to environmental change often occurs over a period of years, and the majority of reported studies are for 1-3 years in duration. This study documents long-term changes (10 years) in structure, composition and growth along a catena of high water table forested sites of an ancient beach ridge landscape in coastal South Carolina.Aboveground net primary production (ANPP) of trees was monitored from 2000 to 2009 on three sites within a longleaf pine-swamp blackgum forest system on the southern end of the Waccamaw Neck area of Georgetown County, SC. Permanent study plots (20 x 25 m) were established across a moisture gradient (Dry, Intermediate, and Wet). Water levels were continuously monitored, litterfall was measured monthly and growth of trees >= 10 cm diameter at breast height was monitored on an annual basis. Annual litterfall and tree production values were summed to provide estimates of ANPP.The study site was under severe drought conditions July 2001 through late summer 2002 and again in 2007. Diameter growth was affected in all three sites, but with different patterns. It seems that diameter growth in the Wet site was more sensitive to drought conditions in 2001-02 and 2007 than either Dry or Intermediate sites. While droughts did not seem to have a significant impact on litterfall in the Wet site, litterfall in the Intermediate site was more sensitive to the drought than either Dry or Wet sites. ANPP was significantly lower in both Intermediate and Wet sites in 2001 at < 602 g/m(2). Highest ANPP (> 1 000 g/m(2)) occurred in the Intermediate and Wet sites in 2003 following a return to more normal water levels at the end of the drought. Maximum tree production occurred on the Wet site in 2003 (657 g/m(2)), which exceeded total ANPP of any site in 2001. In the Dry site, ANPP remained relatively consistent throughout the study when compared to Wet and Intermediate sites. While litterfall estimates are well defined with 3-5 years of data, data collection is continuing to assess impact of drought on stem growth across the gradient, which is still not clear with 10 years of data.									6	0	0	4	0	6			1752-9921			WOS:000288249600007

Specifically, the authors investigated the doping effect of Al into ZnO on structural, optical and electrical properties. The Al-doped ZnO nanowires exhibited high transmittance in the visible wavelengths. The optical bandgap of the Al-doped ZnO nanowires was tuned by varying the Al concentration, resulting in a decrease in the electrical resistance of the 2 at.% Al-doped ZnO nanowires. This subsequent decrease revealed that the Al(3+) ions were successfully doped in the ZnO, with a minimal electrical resistance for 2 at.% Al-doped ZnO nanowires.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1750-0443			WOS:000288202800014

Hsein								Practical optimization of group piles using discrete Lagrange multiplier method								OPTIMIZATION AND ENGINEERING				12	1-2			83	109		10.1007/s11081-010-9117-z			MAR 2011	2011	This paper presents a practical methodology for designing group piles of a bridge foundation that can minimize the construction cost. The constraint functions for the designed pile group are constructed according to the design code currently adopted in local engineering practice. A new procedure based on the discrete Lagrange multiplier (DLM) method is proposed for searching the optimal solution. Seven real-world design cases are used to test the validity and the performance of the proposed procedure and algorithm, in which the DLM solutions are compared with the global optimum solutions obtained by the exhaustive searching method (ESM). Vast improvement in the computational efficiency is achieved, as the DLM method can find local minimum solutions in less than 2.0 to 4.0 minutes whereas the time required with the ESM is 10,000 to 25,000 times longer. In the case studies presented, the construction costs in conjunction with the use of the DLM method differ from the global minimum costs by less than 6.0%, but the savings over the original designs can be as high as 13% to 56%.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1389-4420			WOS:000288217300006

Incorporation of PFPE segments in PLA lowers significantly both the polar and dispersive components of total surface energy. Total surface energy is lowered from ca 35 to ca 17 mN m(-1) on copolymerization of PLA with 5 wt% PFPE. Thermal analysis data reveal that lower molecular weight PFPE segments lower significantly the glass transition, crystallization and melting temperatures of the PLA matrix. Although block length variation of the PFPE segment does not affect surface energies of copolymer films, smaller PFPE segments increase significantly the low-temperature modulus as observed from dynamic mechanical analysis.

Sudden Death Following Delayed Traumatic Diaphragmatic Herniation								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FORENSIC MEDICINE AND PATHOLOGY				32	1			47	49		10.1097/PAF.0b013e3181ed7a13			MAR 2011	2011	Blunt force trauma to the chest can often result in diaphragmatic tears. These tears can go months without being discovered, until a secondary injury or circumstance causes an organ to herniate through the diaphragm. Special care should be taken at autopsy to determine the mechanism of injury of any tears in the diaphragm as this may influence the cause and manner of death. We present a case of a 28-year-old man who suffered multiple injuries in a motor vehicle collision. Six months later he presented with a left diaphragmatic tear and gastric fundal herniation, and died eventually.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0195-7910			WOS:000287126800010	20683321

Perched vadose zone water at Rainier Mesa has high levels of DOM as a result of microbial degradation of mining debris (diesel, wood, etc.). The Am and Pu sorption K(d)s were up to two orders of magnitude lower in water with high DOM (15-19 mg C/L) compared to the same water with DOM removed (<0.4 mg C/L) or in naturally low DOM (0.2 mg C/L) groundwater. In contrast, K(d)s of Np and U were less affected by DOM at these solution conditions. Uranium sorption decreased as a result of high dissolved inorganic C (DIG) resulting from microbial degradation of DOM. Thermodynamic model predictions, based on actinide-humic acid stability constants available in the literature, are in general agreement with measured K(d) data, correctly predicting the effects of DIG and DOM on actinide retardation. This agreement is encouraging to future modeling efforts and suggests that effects of DOM and DIG can be incorporated into reactive transport modeling predictions. The Am and Pu transport rates in Rainier Mesa tunnel waters will be substantially faster as a result of the elevated DOM levels. Low diffusion rates of actinide-DOM macromolecular complexes may focus Pu and Am transport into fractures and minimize retardation via matrix diffusion. The resulting transport behavior will affect actinide distribution patterns and associated risk estimates. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Evaluation of USDA Soybean Germplasm Accessions for Resistance to Soybean Rust in the Southern United States								CROP SCIENCE				51	2			678	693		10.2135/cropsci2010.06.0340			MAR 2011	2011	Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] resistance to soybean rust (SBR) caused by Phakopsora pachyrhizi could reduce reliance on fungicides to manage this disease. The objective of this study was to identify soybean germplasm with resistance to field populations of P. pachyrhizi in the United States. Field evaluations of 576 accessions from the USDA Soybean Germ-plasm Collection for resistance to SBR were conducted at seven locations in the southern United States between 2006 and 2008. Accessions from maturity groups (MG) 000 to X and North American susceptible check cultivars from each MG except X were rated for disease severity in all year-location environments, and for disease incidence, fungal sporulation, lesion type, and/or uredinia density in certain environments. While none of the accessions was immune in all environments, 64 were resistant in two or more locations each year that they were tested. Some accessions appeared to be more resistant in certain environments than in others. Of the original four Rpp genes described in the literature, Rpp1 provided the highest level of resistance, and among the accessions with uncharacterized Rpp genes, PI 567104B had the highest overall resistance across environments. The plant introductions confirmed to be resistant in these evaluations should be useful sources of genes for resistance to North American populations of P. pachyrhizi.									17	1	0	16	2	19			0011-183X			WOS:000287480900032

Simulations were conducted to quantify the influence of the nozzle width, jet axis separation, Reynolds number, and the relative jet strength on the distance from the source to the merger point. The simulation results were then compared with experimental results published in literature. As the jet fluid exited the two nozzles, the shear layer between the jet and the ambient fluid drove the ambient fluid entrainment into the jets. However, a finite volume of fluid trapped was between the two jets, and a recirculation zone with two counterrotating vortices was established. This vortex pair reduced the pressure between the jets, drawing them together more rapidly than theoretical models predicted. The simulation results indicated that equal-strength jets merged at a distance downstream of 1.4 times the initial nozzle centerline separation provided that the nozzle-separation-to-nozzle-width ratio was greater than 18. As the source momentum flux of one jet decreased relative to the other, the relative distance to merger also decreased. However, for source momentum flux ratios between 0.2 and 0.9, the merger distance was only a very weak function of the momentum flux ratio. The CFD-measured merging distance was significantly closer to the jet nozzles than current models predict. Therefore, the mixing of pollutants by using parallel plane jets is less efficient than currently thought. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0000308.

Laboratory Evaluation of Stone Matrix Asphalt Mixtures with Polyethylene and Cellulose Stabilizers								JOURNAL OF TESTING AND EVALUATION				39	2			191	201		10.1520/JTE102919			MAR 2011	2011	This paper deals with the viability of using reclaimed polyethylene (PE) derived from low-density PE carry bags in shredded form collected from domestic waste as stabilizing fibers to evaluate the performance of stone matrix asphalt (SMA). Conventional SMA mixtures were used as reference mixture and were prepared using 60/70-grade asphalt cement and cellulose fibers as stabilizer. The use of PE-modified binder (PEMB) was also investigated as stabilizer in SMA mixtures. The performance of these mixtures was evaluated by conducting draindown, moisture susceptibility test, aging test, rutting test, creep test, permeability test, and fatigue life tests. The PE fibers reinforce the binder system, resulting in the increase in the viscosity of the system. Draindown test results indicated that PE fibers can be effectively used as a stabilizer in SMA to retard draindown of binder and mineral filler. To study the behaviour of SMA mixtures with different additives, mixtures were designed by Marshall and Superpave. Results showed that mixtures designed by Superpave yielded in 0.2 % reduced asphalt content compared to mixtures designed by the Marshall method. From the present study, results indicated that mixtures prepared with PE fibers showed improved performance than reference SMA mixtures with cellulose fibers. Mixtures prepared with PEMB showed improved performance properties compared to mixtures with PE fibers and cellulose fibers.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0090-3973	1945-7553		WOS:000296596200010

The structural failure of these historic structures would severely and adversely impact the economies of these nations due to the massive disruptions of transportation systems accompanying such failures. To successfully maintain these aging masonry structures, performance assessment must incorporate the unique mechanical characteristics of masonry. Therefore, the preferred analysis technique must go beyond a linear approach. This study assesses the earthquake performance of a restored historical masonry arch bridge through nonlinear finite element analysis incorporating the Drucker-Prager damage criterion. The case study structure is the Mikron Arch Bridge, a nineteenth century Ottoman Era structure built over the Firtina River near Rize, Turkey, and restored in 1998. The Mikron Arch Bridge was first subjected to ambient vibration testing, during which accelerometers were placed at several points on the bridge span to record the bridge vibratory response. The investigators then used Enhanced Frequency Domain Decomposition and Stochastic Subspace Identification techniques to extract the experimental natural frequencies, mode shapes, and damping ratios from these measurements. Experimental results were compared with those obtained by the linear finite element analysis of the bridge. Good agreement between mode shapes was observed during this comparison, though natural frequencies disagree by 8-10%. The boundary conditions of the linear finite element model of Mikron Arch Bridge are adjusted such that the analytical predictions agree with the ambient vibration test results. By introducing the Drucker-Prager damage criterion, the calibrated linear FE model was next extended into a nonlinear model. Nonlinear analysis of seismic behavior of Mikron arch bridge was performed considering the acceleration record of Erzincan earthquake in 1992 that occurred near the Mikron Bridge region. The displacement and stress results were observed to be allowable level of the stone material. Moreover, linear FE model calibrations elicited a significant influence on the nonlinear FE model simulations.									9	1	0	0	0	9			0924-090X			WOS:000287506300020

With respect to previous fibers drawn using a borosilicate cladding, the present fibers exhibit negligible oxygen despite being fabricated at more than twice the melting point of the germanium. The counterintuitive result of less oxygen when the fiber is drawn at a higher temperatures is discussed.

For this laboratory study, the crumb rubber modified (CRM) and control binders were aged using an oven aging method. Also, asphalt mixtures with CRM or control binders were made and subjected to short-term and long-term aging treatments. The properties of these aged binders were evaluated using gel permeation chromatography (GPC) test procedures. The results from this study showed that: (1) the higher CRM percentage resulted in the higher large molecular size (LMS) value of asphalt binder under the binder aging conditions, and the rate of increase in the LMS value was found to have a relation to the CRM percentage. The asphalt binders with higher CRM percentages (15% and 20%) had a trend the LMS values decrease after a certain level. This finding is thought to be related to the required time for the rubber to be fully digested: (2) after subjecting to the long-term oven aging, the asphalt mixtures with the control and CRM modified binders were found to have statistically insignificant differences in aging level, measured using the LMS values. The very thin film thickness of binder in asphalt mixture and the aging temperature of 100 degrees C insufficient to enable a reaction were considered to be the main reasons that no differences were observed from the standpoint of the aging effect.

Inhibition of CYP microsomes (CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1, CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and CYP2C19) was monitored using a fluorescent assay. Potent inhibition was found against CYP1A1 with IC(50) and K(i) for CA1 (acetamide), being the lowest at 1.547+/-1.0 mu M and 0.37 mu M respectively, displaying non-competitive kinetics. The selectivity for CYP1A1 was increased in CA3 (butanamide), which also exhibited cytotoxicity against breast cancer cells, MCF7 with an IC(50) of 47.46+/-1.62 mu M. Structure-activity relationship studies provide insight at a molecular level for CAs with implications in chemoprevention and chemotherapy. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In the case of the RPP, other than thermal energy, the vacuum ultraviolet photons are used as an additional source of energy. We have investigated the secondary-ion-mass-spectroscopy impurity profiles at different concentrations of P in Si. Based on our own experimental results and the data published in the open literature, we have provided an explanation of the enhanced diffusion both for the RTP and RPP cases. The thermal factor leads to the excitation (vibration) of atoms and quantum energy to the electron system excitation. As compared with the pure thermal process, the quantum-energy contribution provides a reduced activation energy and a higher diffusion coefficient.									4	0	1	0	0	4			0018-9383			WOS:000287665700028

Applications include tires, springs, and stiffeners, among others. The governing differential equations are derived using the principle of virtual work and the formulation includes deformations due to bending, transverse shear and circumferential extension. The three associated stiffness quantities, EI, GA and EA, respectively, remain as independent parameters in the differential equations. This allows the special cases such as an inextensible Timoshenko beam (EI and GA) or an extensible Euler beam (EI and EA) to be obtained directly by the appropriate limits. The effect of these three stiffness parameters on the contact pressure solution is studied, which shows how those fundamental parameters can be selected for the purpose of the application. Although the formulation is for small displacement theory, both radial and circumferential distributed loads are considered, which allows the pressure in the deformed state to be vertical rather than radial, which is shown to be important Closed form expressions for all force and displacement quantities are obtained in terms of the angular location of the edge of contact, which must be determined numerically. Extensibility complicates the analytical expressions within the contact region, and a series solution is proposed in this case. A two-term asymptotic expression for the stiffness of the ring is determined analytically. Finally, all solutions are validated using the commercial finite element software ABAQUS, with attention to non-linear behavior and the range of validity of these solutions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Nebulization-assisted layer-by-layer assembly (LbL) is a modification to the well-characterized LbL assembly method. The conventional method of producing electrostatically assembled multilayer films through sequential substrate dipping was compared to the nebulization method, and the resultant film characteristics were investigated. Varied coatings can be generated according to the alterations in deposition parameters, with the most influential being nebulizer distance and time. In addition to employment of polyelectrolytes (PEs), the nebulization method has been extrapolated to generate assemblies containing nanoparticles and a model drug, dexamethasone. It is shown that in comparison with conventional LbL, similar bilayers' layering thicknesses can be achieved within a much smaller timeframe. Furthermore, PEs and more complex protein and nanoparticle assemblies can be incorporated to influence the surface topography and functionality. The potential to expeditiously assemble multicomponent films has far-reaching implications in many focus areas.									7	0	0	1	0	7			1547-0091			WOS:000287710600014

In vivo the association occurs in a particular cellular compartment, where the individual monomers arc supposed to meet and form a complex. Since the monomers and the complex exist in the same micro environment, it is plausible that they coevolved toward its properties, in particular, toward the characteristic subcellular pH. Here we show that the pH at which the monomers are most stable (pH-optimum) or the pH at which stability is almost pH-independent (pH-flat) of monomers are correlated with the pH-optimum of maximal affinity (pH-optimum of binding) or pH interval at which affinity is almost pH-independent (pH-flat of binding) of the complexes made of the corresponding monomers. The analysis of interfacial properties of protein complexes demonstrates that pH-dependent properties can be roughly estimated using the interface charge alone. In addition, we introduce a parameter beta, proportional to the square root of the absolute product of the net charges of monomers, and show that protein complexes characterized with small or very large beta tend to have neutral pH-optimum. Further more, protein complexes made of monomers carrying the same polarity net charge at neutral pH have either very low or very high pH-optimum of binding. These findings are used to propose empirical rule for predicting pH-optimum of binding provided that the amino acid compositions of the corresponding monomers are available.									23	0	0	17	0	23			0887-3585			WOS:000287784000019	21287623

When more than one quality characteristic is considered, an important question is how to trade off robust design solutions. In this paper, we consider a bi-objective robust design problem for which Pareto solutions of two quality characteristics need to be obtained. In practical robust design applications, a second-order polynomial model is adequate to accommodate the curvature of process mean and variance functions, thus mean-squared robust design models, frequently used by many researchers, would contain fourth-order terms. Consequently, the associated Pareto frontier might be non-convex and supported and non-supported efficient solutions needs to be generated. So, the objective of this paper is to develop a lexicographic weighted-Tchebycheff based bi-objective robust design model to generate the associated Pareto frontier. Our numerical example clearly shows the advantages of this model over frequently used weighted-sums model. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Sodium content in retail Cheddar, Mozzarella, and process cheeses varies considerably in the United States								JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE				94	3			1605	1615		10.3168/jds.2010-3782			MAR 2011	2011	Reducing the sodium content in cheese is expected to contribute to reducing the overall intake of sodium by US consumers. The purpose of this study was to measure the sodium levels in cheeses that are most commonly purchased by US consumers in the retail market, including brand and private label. A secondary purpose of the study was to generate data that can enable the dairy industry to adopt best practices regarding sodium levels in cheeses. The sodium content of a total of 1,665 samples of Cheddar (650 samples), low moisture part skim (LMPS) Mozzarella (746 samples), and process cheese singles (269 samples) from 4 geographical regions were collected over a period of 3 wk, and were analyzed over a 1-mo period. Process cheese contained the highest mean level of sodium (1,242 mg/100 g), followed by string cheese (724 mg/100 g). Across Cheddar cheese forms and brands, the mean analytical sodium was 615 mg/100 g, with 95% between 474 and 731 mg/100 g; label sodium ranged from 600 to 800 mg/100 g (mean 648 mg). Across all LMPS Mozzarella forms and brands, the mean analytical sodium was 666 mg/100 g, with 95% between 452 and 876 mg/100g; label sodium ranged from 526 to 893 mg/100 g (mean 685 mg). Across all process cheese forms and brands, the mean analytical sodium was 1,242 mg/100 g, with 95% between 936 and 1,590 mg/100 g; label sodium ranged from 1,185 to 1,740 mg/100 g (mean 1,313 mg/100 g). These findings demonstrate that manufacturers tended to be conservative with their reporting of sodium on labels. Manufacturers need to reduce variability to better target desired sodium levels, which is an opportunity for better process control, and will enable them to label sodium more accurately.									21	0	0	18	1	21			0022-0302			WOS:000287473500056	21338828	
J	Li, Ruixuan; Song, Wei; Shen, Haiying; Xiao, Weijun; Lu, Zhengding								A flabellate overlay network for multi-attribute search								JOURNAL OF PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING				71	3			407	423		10.1016/j.jpdc.2010.11.002			MAR 2011	2011	Peer-to-peer (P2P) technology provides a popular way of distributing resources, sharing, and locating in a large-scale distributed environment. However, most of the current existing P2P systems only support queries over a single resource attribute, such as file name. The current multiple resource attribute search methods often encounter high maintenance cost and lack of resilience to the highly dynamic environment of P2P networks. In this paper, we propose a Flabellate overlAy Network (FAN), a scalable and structured underlying P2P overlay supporting resource queries over multi-dimensional attributes. In FAN, the resources are mapped into a multi-dimensional Cartesian space based on the consistent hash values of the resource attributes. The mapping space is divided into non-overlapping and continuous subspaces based on the peer's distance. This paper presents strategies for managing the extended adjacent subspaces, which is crucial to network maintenance and resource search in FAN. The algorithms of a basic resource search and range query over FAN are also presented in this paper. To alleviate the load of the hot nodes, a virtual replica network (VRN) consisting of the nodes with the same replicates is proposed for replicating popular resources adaptively. The queries can be forwarded from the heavily loaded nodes to the lightly loaded ones through VRN. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that FAN has a higher routing efficiency and lower network maintenance cost over the existing multi-attribute search methods. Also, VRN efficiently balances the network load and reduces the querying delay in FAN while invoking a relatively low overhead. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Historically, community ecologists have conceived of communities as largely isolated entities and have focused on local environmental factors and interspecific interactions as the major forces determining species composition. However, stream ecologists have long embraced a multiscale approach to studying riverine ecosystems and have studied both local factors and larger-scale regional factors, such as dispersal and disturbance. River networks exhibit a dendritic spatial structure that can constrain aquatic organisms when their dispersal is influenced by or confined to the river network. We contend that the principles of metacommunity theory would help stream ecologists to understand how the complex spatial structure of river networks mediates the relative influences of local and regional control on species composition. From a basic ecological perspective, the concept is attractive because new evidence suggests that the importance of regional processes (dispersal) depends on spatial structure of habitat and on connection to the regional species pool. The role of local factors relative to regional factors will vary with spatial position in a river network. From an applied perspective, the long-standing view in ecology that local community composition is an indicator of habitat quality may not be uniformly applicable across a river network, but the strength of such bioassessment approaches probably will depend on spatial position in the network. The principles of metacommunity theory are broadly applicable across taxa and systems but seem of particular consequence to stream ecology given the unique spatial structure of riverine systems. By explicitly embracing processes at multiple spatial scales, metacommunity theory provides a foundation on which to build a richer understanding of stream communities.									73	0	0	74	0	74			0887-3593			WOS:000287114800025		
J	Dingankar, C.; Karandikar, Sampada; Brooks, R.; Griffin, C.								On Bandwidth-Limited Sum-of-Games Problems								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART A-SYSTEMS AND HUMANS				41	2			341	349		10.1109/TSMCA.2010.2064302			MAR 2011	2011	Game theory typically considers two types of imperfect information when analyzing conflicts: 1) chance moves and 2) information sets. This correspondence paper considers games where players compete on many fronts without having sufficient bandwidth to collect the game trees describing all the conflicts. The player therefore needs to prioritize between subgames without having detailed information about the subgames. We address this problem by using two combinatorial game theory tools: 1) surreal numbers and 2) thermographs. We consider the global conflict as a sum-of-games problem, which is known to be intractable (PSPACE complete). Known combinatorial game theory heuristics can analyze surreal-number encodings of games using thermographs to find solutions that are within a known constant offset of the optimal solution. To apply the combinatorial game theory to this domain, we first integrate chance moves into surreal-number encodings of games by showing that the expected values of surreal numbers are surreal numbers. We then show that, of the three commonly used sum-of-games heuristics, only hotstrat is applicable to this domain. Simulations compare solutions found using hotstrat to solution approaches used by other researchers on a similar problem (maximin, maximax, and mean). The simulations show that the hotstrat solutions dominate the existing approaches.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1083-4427			WOS:000286385800014

A peak at similar to 1860 cm(-1) (ITALO(-)) is observed due to a combination of the in-plane transverse acoustic (iTA) and the longitudinal optical (LO) phonons. The intensity of this peak decreases with increasing number, of layers and this peak is absent for bulk graphite. The overtone of the out-of-plane transverse optical (oTO), phonon at similar to 1750 cm(-1), also called the M band, is suppressed for both SLG and IBLG. In addition, two previously unidentified modes at similar to 2200 and similar to 1880 cm(-1) are observed in SLG. The 2220 cm(-1) (1880 cm(-1)) mode is tentatively assigned to the combination mode of In plane transverse optical (iTO) and TA phonons (oTO+LO phonons) around the K point in the graphene Brillouin zone. Finally, the peak frequency of the 1880 (2220) cm(-1) mode is observed to increase (decrease) linearly with increasing graphene layers.									86	3	0	6	0	86			1936-0851			WOS:000288570600006	21204569

J	Movafagh, Shahrzad; Cleemann, Lars; Morad, Martin								Regulation of cardiac Ca2+ channel by extracellular Na+								CELL CALCIUM				49	3			162	173		10.1016/j.ceca.2011.01.008			MAR 2011	2011	Hyponatremia is a predictor of poor cardiovascular outcomes during acute myocardial infarction and in the setting of preexisting heart failure [1]. There are no definitive mechanisms as to how hyponatremia suppresses cardiac function. In this report we provide evidence for direct down-regulation of Ca2+ channel current in response to low serum Na+. In voltage-clamped rat ventricular myocytes or HEK 293 cells expressing the L-type Ca2+ channel, a 15 mM drop in extracellular Na+ suppressed the Ca2+ current by similar to 15%; with maximal suppression of similar to 30% when Na+ levels were reduced to 100 mM or less. The suppressive effects of low Na+ on I-Ca, in part, depended on the substituting monovalent species (Li+, Cs+, TEA(+)), but were independent of phosphorylation state of the channel and possible influx of Ca2+ on Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. Acidification sensitized the Ca2+ channel current to Na+ withdrawal. Collectively our data suggest that Na+ and H+ may interact with regulatory site(s) at the outer recesses of the Ca2+ channel pore thereby directly modulating the electro-diffusion of the permeating divalents (Ca2+, Ba2+).

More Oil, Less Democracy: Evidence from Worldwide Crude Oil Discoveries								ECONOMIC JOURNAL				121	551			89	115		10.1111/j.1468-0297.2009.02327.x			MAR 2011	2011	This article exploits variations in the timing and size of oil discoveries to identify the impact of oil wealth on democracy. I find that discovering 100 billion barrels of oil (approximately the initial endowment of Iraq) pushes a country's democracy level almost 20 percentage points below trend after three decades. The estimated effect is larger for oilfields with higher-quality oil and lower exploration and extraction costs. However, the estimates become less precise when oil abundance is measured by oil discovery per capita, suggesting politicians may care about the level instead of the per capita value of oil wealth.									47	0	0	2	0	47			0013-0133			WOS:000287363300004

Origin and pathogenesis of such changes are not absolutely clear.Methods: Relevant publications were drawn from PUBMED using the keywords 'anorexia nervosa' AND 'autonomic'. Fifty two abstracts were identified and screened for papers that measured the state of autonomic regulation by means of analysis of heart rate variability either during 24-hour electrocardiography (ECG) monitoring or during a short-term laboratory test. Studies selected were analysed for the number of patients included, the presence and quality of control groups, gender, age and body mass index (BMI) of patients, type of AN as well as methods used to determine heart rate variability (HRV).Results: Twenty papers on HRV in patients with anorexia were identified and analysed, revealing three distinct positions regarding changes of autonomic nervous system (ANS) functions in patients with AN. The majority of papers identified parasympathetic/sympathetic imbalance with parasympathetic dominance and decreased sympathetic modulation; others could not replicate these findings, but instead described sympathetic dominance; finally a group of papers could not identify any autonomic differences in comparison to control samples. We conclude that in its current state of analysis HRV may not be suitable for routine assessment of ANS function in AN patients but rather remains a research tool.

Comparison of anthocyanins and phenolics in organically and conventionally grown blueberries in selected cultivars								FOOD CHEMISTRY				125	1			201	208		10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.08.063			MAR 1 2011	2011	Consumption of berries has become popular among health-conscious consumers due to the high levels of valuable antioxidants, such as anthocyanins, and phenolic compounds in berries. Four Rabbiteye blueberry cultivars (i.e., Powderblue, Climax, Tifblue, and Woodward) grown organically and conventionally were compared regarding their chemical profiles and antioxidant capacity in terms of total phenolic content (TPC). total anthocyanin content (TAC) and ORAC activity. Regardless of the high TPC, TAC and ORAC in both organically and conventionally grown blueberries, not all the organic berries showed significantly higher TPC, TAC and ORAC than the conventional berries. The chemical profiles (i.e., the free phenolic compounds and anthocyanins) were determined with aid of HPLC-MS, by which 13 individual anthocyanins and seven free phenolics were identified. This study demonstrated the subtle differences of bioactive phytochemicals between the organically and conventionally grown berries.

Findings show that relationship conflict moderates the task conflict team performance relationship. Specifically, the relationship is curvilinear in the shape of an inverted U when relationship conflict is low, but the relationship is linear and negative when relationship conflict is high. The results for team-member satisfaction are more equivocal, but the findings provide some evidence that relationship conflict exacerbates the negative relationship between task conflict and team-member satisfaction.									45	1	0	1	0	46			0021-9010			WOS:000288584400013	20939655

Mistreatment and Psychological Well-being Among Older Adults: Exploring the Role of Psychosocial Resources and Deficits								JOURNALS OF GERONTOLOGY SERIES B-PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES				66	2			217	229		10.1093/geronb/gbq096			MAR 2011	2011	Objectives. To examine the relationships between psychosocial resources and deficits, elder mistreatment, and psychological well-being.Methods. We used a representative sample of 2,744 older adults aged 57-85 years in the United States from the National Social Life, Health and Aging Project. We examined reports of any mistreatment (verbal, financial, or physical) and multiple types of mistreatment.Results. Lower levels of positive support, higher levels of criticism from close relationships, and feelings of social isolation are positively associated with self-reported mistreatment experience. As suggested by the stress process theory, those who reported mistreatment experience also reported lower levels of global happiness and higher levels of psychological distress. There is also some evidence for the buffering hypothesis-levels of global happiness are higher and levels of psychological distress are lower for older adults who reported any mistreatment if they also reported more positive social support, social participation, and feelings of social connection.Discussion. Older adults with fewer psychosocial resources or more psychosocial deficits seem to be more vulnerable to mistreatment, and mistreatment seems particularly detrimental to psychological well-being for these people.									11	2	0	2	0	13			1079-5014			WOS:000288139500009	21239415

CT examinations were simulated for scans performed along the patient long axis for each dosimetry data set using a 4 cm beam width ranging from the upper thighs to top of the head. Five basic body regions (head, neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis), as well as combinations of the regions (head/neck, chest/abdomen, abdomen/pelvis, and chest/abdomen/pelvis) and whole body CT scans were investigated. Correction factors were generated that can be applied to convert E/DLP conversion factors based on ICRP 60 data to conversion factors that are valid for ICRP 103 data (i.e., E-103/E-60).Results: Use of ICRP 103 weighting factors increase effective doses for head scans by similar to 11%, for chest scans by similar to 20%, and decrease effective doses for pelvis scans by similar to 25%. Current E/DLP conversion factors are estimated to be 2.4 mu Sv/mGy cm for head CT examinations and range between 14 and 20 mu Sv/mGy cm for body CT examinations.Conclusions: Factors that enable patient CT doses to be adjusted to account for ICRP 103 tissue weighting factors are provided, which result in E/DLP factors that were increased in head and chest CT, reduced in pelvis CT, and showed no marked change in neck and abdomen CT.

The sensor detects conformational changes in a surface-bound construct of the calcium-sensitive protein calmodulin. Increases in calcium concentration induce a 0.96 nm red shift in the spectral position of the LSPR extinction maximum (lambda(max)). Addition of a calcium chelating agent forces the protein to return to its original conformation and is detected as a reversal of the lambda(max) shift. As opposed to previous work, this work demonstrates that these conformational changes produce a detectable shift in lambda(max) even in the absence of a protein label, with a signal:noise ratio near 500. In addition, the protein conformational changes reversibly switch both the wavelength and intensity of the resonance peak, representing an example of a bimodal plasmonic component that simultaneously relays two distinct forms of optical information. This highly versatile plasmonic device acts as a biological sensor, enabling the detection of calcium ions with a biologically relevant limit of detection of 23,mu M, as well as the detection of calmodulin-specific protein ligands.									64	1	0	15	0	65			1530-6984			WOS:000288061500032	21280643

Social forces; a scientific medium of social study and interpretation				89	3						10.1353/sof.2011.0003			2011-Mar-1	2011	We summarize prior theories on the adaptation process of the contemporary immigrant second generation as a prelude to presenting additive and interactive models showing the impact of family variables, school contexts and academic outcomes on the process. For this purpose, we regress indicators of educational and occupational achievement in early adulthood on predictors measured three and six years earlier. The Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study (CILS), used for the analysis, allows us to establish a clear temporal order among exogenous predictors and the two dependent variables. We also construct a Downward Assimilation Index (DAI), based on six indicators and regress it on the same set of predictors. Results confirm a pattern of segmented assimilation in the second generation, with a significant proportion of the sample experiencing downward assimilation. Predictors of the latter are the obverse of those of educational and occupational achievement. Significant interaction effects emerge between these predictors and early school contexts, defined by different class and racial compositions. Implications of these results for theory and policy are examined.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0037-7732			MEDLINE:24223437	24223437

The HSDW acts like an externally applied one-dimensional periodic (magnetic) potential for spins on the surface of the TI, rendering the Dirac cone on the TI surface highly anisotropic. The decrease in group velocity along the direction (x) over cap of the applied spin potential is twice as great as that perpendicular to (x) over cap. At the Brillouin zone boundaries, it also gives rise to new semi-Dirac points that have a linear dispersion along (x) over cap but a quadratic dispersion perpendicular to (x) over cap. The group velocity of electrons at these new semi-Dirac points is also shown to be highly anisotropic. Experiments using TI systems on multiferroic substrates should realize our predictions. We further discuss the effects of other forms of spin density waves on the surface transport property of TIs.									9	0	0	0	0	9			1098-0121			WOS:000287729500004

The influences of iron(II) chlorideiwater, and thermal processing on the oxygen-scavenging capability were investigated. NPs without iron(II) chloride, moisture, and thermal processing had no oxygen-scavenging effect. However, the oxygen content (%) in the cup headspace of 20.9% decreased to 20.4% when the oxygen-scavenging system contained NPs, water, and iron(II) chloride. The oxygen content (%) decreased further to 19.5% when water was eliminated from the mixture. In this research, NPs and iron(II) chloride with thermal processing had an oxygen-scavenging capacity of 6.44 cm(3) of O(2)/g and an oxygen-scavenging rate of 0.21 cm(3) of O(2) g(-1) day(-1). Results indicated that NPs and iron(II) chloride in an oxygen-scavenging system can be used as a heat-activated oxygen scavenger.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0021-8561			WOS:000287297100054	21287982

Evaluating alternative electrostatic potential models for polyacrylamide-co-acrylate in aqueous solution								JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE				354	2			709	717		10.1016/j.jcis.2010.10.059			FEB 15 2011	2011	The capabilities of three simplified analytical equations to accurately model electrostatic interactions during proton binding and release by linear anionic polyelectrolytes in aqueous solution were evaluated. The impermeable sphere (IS), Donnan (DN), and cylindrical (CY) electrostatic models were fit to experimental acid-base titration curves of linear polyacrylamide-co-acrylate having ionizable site densities ranging from ca. 10-35%. The titrations were conducted in 0.003-0.12 M NaCl solutions and the sum of squared errors from modeled and experimental data was used as a comparative index of each model's capability. In addition, the relative size of each polyelectrolyte was estimated from its measured specific viscosity and then compared against the values obtained from the fitting procedure for the size parameter that each model contained. Although the IS and DN electrostatic models could be used to obtain reasonably good fits to each titration curve, the size parameter values obtained by each model were not reflective of the actual polyelectrolyte sizes, indicating that the models had limited physical meaning and that the size parameter was essentially just an additional fitting parameter in each model. In contrast, the CV model was not only more effective in its ability to fit the titration data but also provided a better physical representation of the polyelectrolyte size. Therefore, for polyelectrolytes that remain essentially linear or are only loosely coiled such that counter ions are free to travel throughout the polymer structure, we conclude that the CV model and its morphological representation of a cylindrical polyelectrolyte are more valid and realistic than the IS and DN models and their representation of polyelectrolytes as spheres.

However, the SA algorithm is limited in its application due to the high computational cost and the difficulties in determining the annealing schedule. This paper demonstrates that the temperature parallel simulated annealing (TPSA) algorithm, a parallel implementation of the SA algorithm, shows great promise to overcome these limitations when applied to continuous functions. The TPSA algorithm greatly reduces the computational time due to its parallel nature, and avoids the determination of the annealing schedule by fixing the temperatures during the annealing process. The main contributions of this paper are threefold. First, this paper explains a simple and effective way to determine the temperatures by applying the concept of critical temperature (T(C)). Second, this paper presents systematic tests of the TPSA algorithm on various continuous functions, demonstrating comparable performance as well-established sequential SA algorithms. Third, this paper demonstrates the application of the TPSA algorithm on a difficult practical inverse problem, namely the hyperspectral tomography problem. The results and conclusions presented in this work provide are expected to be useful for the further development and expanded applications of the TPSA algorithm. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The reaction affords both the [5,6]- and [6,6]-monoadducts with a four-membered ring attached to the cage surface on 5,6-and 6,6-ring fusions, respectively. The compounds were characterized by MALDI-TOF, NMR, UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy and single-crystal X-ray structure determination. The electrochemical behavior of both monoadducts was investigated. The [5,6]-regioisomer displays reversible cathodic behavior similar to that observed for the fulleropyrrolidines with a 5,6-addition pattern. Surprisingly, the [6,6]-regioisomer also exhibits reversible cathodic behavior. The interconversion reaction of the isomers was also explored, and the results showed that both monoadducts are thermally very stable.									35	0	0	7	0	35			0002-7863			WOS:000287228500072	21218804

In this article, we demonstrate that by varying the Ag concentration, we can manipulate which variant of the Ag(2)Te structure stabilizes at room temperature (monoclinic alpha-Ag(2)Te or cubic beta-Ag(1.9)Te) and can consequently manipulate the electrical and thermal transport behavior of the composite and hence the thermoelectric performance. Additionally, we show that Cu-doping results in an overall improvement in thermoelectric performance. Our results suggest that formation of composites is a viable path for achieving a phonon-glass-electron-crystal (PGEC) alloy. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

However, the origins for the SMOI effect are still in debate. In this research, SMOI of Rh and vanadium oxide (as a promoter) supported on SiO2 were studied at the site level for the first time, which provides an insight into the modification of surface properties after high temperature reduction. H-2 chemisorption, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS), and SSITKA (steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis) were used to probe the SMOI effects. The catalytic properties of the catalysts for CO hydrogenation were investigated using a differential fixed bed reactor at 230 degrees C and 1.8 atm, while for SSITKA, a reaction temperature of 280 degrees C and an excess of H-2 was used to maximize methane production. The addition of V to Rh/SiO2 suppresses H-2 chemisorption, and high reduction temperature further decreases H-2 chemisorption on Rh/V/SiO2 but has little effect on Rh/SiO2. As reduction temperature increases, the activity for CO hydrogenation on Rh/SiO2 remains essentially unchanged, but the activity of Rh/V/SiO2 decreases significantly. SSITKA shows that the concentration of surface reaction intermediates decreases on Rh/V/SiO2 as the reduction temperature increases, but the activities of the reaction sites increase. The results suggest that Rh being covered by VOx species is probably the main reason for the decreased overall activity induced by high reduction temperature, but more active sites appear to be formed probably at the Rh-VOx interface.

Color Schlieren imaging of high-pressure overexpanded planar nozzle flow using a simple, low-cost test apparatus								JOURNAL OF VISUALIZATION				14	1			11	14		10.1007/s12650-010-0056-8			FEB 2011	2011	Complex flow features within rocket nozzles can exert significant influence on both the dynamics and safety of rockets during flight. Specifically, under over-expanded flow conditions, during, low altitude flight, random, often large side loads can appear within nozzles. While significant research has focused on this classical problem, due to the high nozzle pressure ratios (NPR) extant across rocket nozzles, most experimental work: (1) has focused on measuring wall pressure distributions under conditions when side loads appear, (2) has been carried out in large government or industrial test facilities, and (3) has only provided limited, though crucially important, visualization data. This short paper describes the construction and operation of a very simple, low cost test apparatus that allows imaging of flow features within planar nozzles, under the high NPR conditions characteristic of medium-to-large rockets. Representative color Schlieren images of flow shock structure obtained within the test apparatus are also presented and briefly described.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1343-8875			WOS:000290686400005

To simulate bimodal flocculation of such sediments, a Two-Class Population Balance Equation (TCPBE), which includes both size-fixed microflocs and size-varying macroflocs, was developed. The new TCPBE was tested by a model-data fitting analysis with experimental data from 1-D column tests, in comparison with the simple Single-Class PBE (SCPBE) and the elaborate Multi-Class PBE (MCPBE). Results showed that the TCPBE was the simplest model that is capable of simulating the major aspects of the bimodal flocculation of marine and estuarine sediments. Therefore, the TCPBE can be implemented in a large-scale multi-dimensional flocculation model with least computational cost and used as a prototypic model for researchers to investigate complicated cohesive sediment transport in marine and estuarine environments. Incorporating additional biological and physicochemical aspects into the TCPBE flocculation process is straight-forward also. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Dynamics groups of asynchronous cellular automata								JOURNAL OF ALGEBRAIC COMBINATORICS				33	1			11	35		10.1007/s10801-010-0231-y			FEB 2011	2011	We say that a finite asynchronous cellular automaton (or more generally, any sequential dynamical system) is pi-independent if its set of periodic points are independent of the order that the local functions are applied. In this case, the local functions permute the periodic points, and these permutations generate the dynamics group. We have previously shown that exactly 104 of the possible 2(23) = 256 cellular automaton rules are pi-independent. In the article, we classify the periodic states of these systems and describe their dynamics groups, which are quotients of Coxeter groups. The dynamics groups provide information about permissible dynamics as a function of update sequence and, as such, connect discrete dynamical systems, group theory, and algebraic combinatorics in a new and interesting way. We conclude with a discussion of numerous open problems and directions for future research.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0925-9899			WOS:000286503800002

Alignment with the Waste Framework Directive (2006/12/EC) is already accomplished and the Hazardous Waste Directive (HWD) (91/689/EEC) has been almost fully transposed into National Legislation. Yet, there are still some discrepancies regarding the provisions needed for the EU's reporting requirements. This study aims at providing a detailed description of the information requested by reporting requirements in EU Hazardous Waste Legislation related to the implementation of the HWD in Turkey. Firstly, a comparison of the EU and Turkish hazardous waste legislations is done and discrepancies in Turkish Hazardous Waste legislations are identified. Then, the current state of implementation tools of the transposed reporting requirements is evaluated. Finally, a roadmap for the full and precise transposition and implementation of EU's Hazardous Waste Management Acquis is developed.

Little is known regarding the Grasse River population of lake sturgeon except that it is one of a few populations in New York State where spawning has been documented. Thus our purpose was to assess the current status of lake sturgeon in the Grasse River system, including age, growth, mortality, and abundance. Age was determined for 196 of 211 lake sturgeon by examination of sectioned pectoral fin rays. Ages ranged from 0 to 32 years and the annual mortality rate for fish between ages 7 and 14 was 16.8%. The weight (W, g) to total length (TL, mm) relationship was W = 1.281 x 10-6TL3.202. The von Bertalanffy growth equation was TL = 1913(1-e-0.0294(t+9.5691)). While the range of observed ages was similar to that of nearby St. Lawrence River populations, mean weight at age for an individual at 1000 mm TL was lower than that observed for lake sturgeon within Lake St. Francis of the St. Lawrence River. Predicted growth based on von Bertalanffy parameters was similar to that observed for the nearby Lake St. Francis. An open population estimator using the POPAN sub-module in the Program MARK produced an abundance estimate of 793 lake sturgeon (95% CI = 337-1249).									6	0	0	7	0	7			0175-8659			WOS:000286478200002

Southdown lambs (n=20; 26 +/- 4.28 kg initial BW) stratified by weight, sex and FAMACHA (c) score were assigned to graze either bermuda-grass [BC; Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.] or chicory [CH; Cichorium intybus L.]. Lambs grazed for 80d from July 7, 2009 to September 25, 2009. Lambs were weighed and FAMACHA (c) scored every 14d. Fecal samples were taken on d 14, 42, 56, and 69 for modified McMaster fecal egg counts. Ultrasound measures of subcutaneous fat thickness (FT) over the 12th and 13th rib and longissimus dorsi muscle depth (MD) were taken on d 80. Lambs grazing CH had lower (P<0.01) FAMACHA (c) scores by d 69 than lambs grazing BC (2.4 +/- 0.43 and 3.1 +/- 0.59, respectively). By d 80 FAMACHA (c) scores were 2.0 +/- 0.22 and 3.9 +/- 0.64 (P<0.01) for CH and BC, respectively and fewer (P<0.01) CH lambs than BC lambs required anthelmintic treatment (0/10 and 7/10, respectively). CH lambs also exhibited lower (P<0.01) FEC than BC lambs. Average daily gain was greater (P<0.01) in lambs grazing CH than those grazing BC (0.28 +/- 0.04 and 0.08 +/- 0.02 kg/d, respectively). At the end of 80 d, weights were 49.2 +/- 3.53 and 33.1 +/- 3.82 kg (P<0.01) for CH and BC. respectively. On d 80, FT and MD were greater in CH lambs than those grazing BC (P<0.01). Lambs grazing CH had increased performance and reduced GIN infection compared to those grazing BC. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									3	1	0	2	1	5			0921-4488			WOS:000287561800018		
J	Saeed, Khawaja A.; Malhotra, Manoj K.; Grover, Varun								Interorganizational System Characteristics and Supply Chain Integration: An Empirical Assessment								DECISION SCIENCES				42	1			7	42		10.1111/j.1540-5915.2010.00300.x			FEB 2011	2011	Some firms have gained significant benefits by effectively deploying interorganizational systems (IOS) to tightly couple operations with their supply chain partners. In contrast, other firms with IOS deployments have struggled to achieve this level of success. So it is not clear how such systems can be configured to promote idiosyncratic interorganizational processes that integrate the supply chains and facilitate successful outcomes. To shed further light on this issue, we draw from multiple theoretical perspectives to develop a comprehensive and unique conceptualization of IOS characteristics that goes beyond the limited treatment it has received in extant literature. Furthermore, we empirically examine the IOS configuration choices made by firms with different supply chain integration (SCI) profiles. Our results support the notion that successful firms sequence the configuration of IOS characteristics toward effectively developing and supporting their supply chain process capabilities. In particular, we found that firms at the lower end of SCI configure IOS features to support supplier evaluation and automatic alerts. As organizations move to the upper end of the SCI spectrum, greater attention is paid to features associated with systems integration, planning, and forecasting. Recommendations to managers and academics stemming from our study are provided, along with avenues for future research.									31	0	0	0	1	32			0011-7315	1540-5915		WOS:000287702600002

These theories, however, do not explicitly consider the availability of alternative systems that users may have access to and may have a preference for. Recent calls for advancing knowledge in technology acceptance have included the examination of selection among competing channels and extending the investigation beyond adoption of a single technology. In this study, we provide a theoretical extension to the TAM by integrating preferential decision knowledge to its constructs. The concept of Attitude-Based Preference and Attribute-Based Preference are introduced to produce a new intention model, namely the Model of Technology Preference (MTP). MTP was validated in the context of alternative behaviors in adopting two service channels: one a technology-based online store and the other a traditional brick-and-mortar store. A sample of 320 responses was used to run a structural equation model. Empirical results show that MTP is a powerful predictor of alternative behaviors. Furthermore, in the context of service channel selection, incorporating preferential decision knowledge into intention models can be used to develop successful business strategies.									13	0	0	0	0	13			0011-7315			WOS:000287702600008		
J	Kline, George L.								Skepticism and faith in Shestov's early critique of rationalism								STUDIES IN EAST EUROPEAN THOUGHT				63	1	SI		15	29		10.1007/s11212-010-9135-6			FEB 2011	2011	Shestov's work can be summed up under six headings. Three are sharp contrasts, three are paradoxes. (1) First there is the contrast between Shestov the person, who was moderate, competent, and calm, and Shestov the thinker, who was extreme, incandescent, and impassioned. (2) Then there is the contrast between his critique of reason, his acceptance of irrationalism, and the means by which he attacks the former and defends the latter: namely, careful rational argument. Sometimes he argues like a lawyer (after all, he had a law degree from Moscow University). (3) Shestov speaks repeatedly of the "horrors and atrocities of human existence." But his examples are always drawn from history or literature, never from his own life, although we know that he experienced much horror. (4) Nietzsche is the thinker whom he invokes most frequently, and most warmly. Yet, paradoxically, Shestov completely ignores most of Nietzsche's central themes. (5) Shestov's skeptical doubts are mostly directed at rationalism; he is not skeptical about the existence or benevolence of God. Yet he is explicitly skeptical about divine omniscience and implicitly skeptical about divine omnipotence in a metaphysical sense, though not in its ethical application. (6) Shestov has a deep faith that God can undo all the horrors of life, putting an end to all suffering. At the same time he knows that this will not, and cannot, happen, since the very idea of undoing the past, erasing its horrors, is conceptually incoherent.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0925-9392			WOS:000287184900003

Full-wave EM modeling can be performed in order to determine the level of radiated emissions produced by a PCB, but this modeling is computationally demanding and does not provide the physical insight necessary to explain how differential signals induce common-mode currents on distant objects. This paper describes a model for determining the common-mode currents on cables attached to a PCB that is based on the concept of imbalance difference. The imbalance difference model is derived from research that shows that changes in geometrical imbalance cause differential-to common-mode conversion. This paper applies an imbalance difference model to PCB structures and compares the resulting equivalent source configurations to those obtained with traditional voltage-and current-driven models, as well as full-structure simulations.									16	2	0	0	0	18			0018-9375			WOS:000287407300018

Closed-form estimates of worst or nearly worst case crosstalk can be useful in system analysis, since these estimates can quickly identify problem areas that require close inspection and they show a clear relationship between design parameters and crosstalk that allows intelligent modification of the system. In this paper, simple formulas are derived to estimate worst case crosstalk between circuits for weak coupling at high frequencies (i.e., where the length of the circuits is comparable to or greater than the wavelengths of the signals of interest). Derivations are based on transmission line theory for general (inductive, capacitive, or resistive) sources and loads, assuming losses at the terminations dominate losses in the transmission lines. Formulas are verified with bench-top and in-vehicle experiments and are shown to predict maximum crosstalk levels within about 6 dB.									5	1	0	0	0	6			0018-9375			WOS:000287407300024

We introduce and distinguish between trust in IT and trust in IT support staff as object-specific beliefs that influence technology's infusion into organizations. We suggest that these object-specific beliefs' influence on intention to explore KMS is mediated by behavioral beliefs about IT (e. g., perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use). To test the model, we completed two studies. Study 1 examined users' perceptions of a knowledge portal. Study 2 examined IT professionals' perceptions of KMS. Across studies, our analysis suggests that trust in IT exerts direct effects on behavioral beliefs leading to intentions to explore KMS. Further, when compared to trust in IT support, we found that trust in IT played a more central role in shaping behavioral beliefs leading to exploration of IT. Implications for research and practice are offered.									27	0	0	0	0	27			0018-9391			WOS:000286384700006

Support Networks of Single Puerto Rican Mothers of Children with Disabilities								JOURNAL OF CHILD AND FAMILY STUDIES				20	1			66	77		10.1007/s10826-010-9378-3			FEB 2011	2011	The social support networks of 25 Puerto Rican single mothers of young children with disabilities were examined and compared with current models of family support for children with disabilities. This study was designed to assess the support systems of Latino single mothers in light of dominant models of family support. The Family Support Scale, the ECOMAP, and responses to open-ended questions were employed to describe the characteristics of Puerto Rican single mothers' support systems. Study findings suggest that members of the children's immediate and extended kinship system, including non-blood relatives (e.g., madrinas), play a strong role in the support network of the mothers interviewed. Implications for early childhood professionals who work with Latino parents of children with disabilities are examined.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1062-1024			WOS:000286394800007		
J	Zhang, Dalun; Barrett, David E.; Katsiyannis, Antonis; Yoon, Myeongsun								Juvenile offenders with and without disabilities: Risks and patterns of recidivism								LEARNING AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES				21	1			12	18		10.1016/j.lindif.2010.09.006			FEB 2011	2011	Youth with disabilities are overrepresented in the juvenile justice system and tend to be repeat offenders. Current intervention strategies have produced differential effects between those with and without disabilities. Yet, little research has been done to examine the differences between these two populations regarding risks for and patterns of recidivism. This study compared patterns of repeated offenses committed by youth with and without disabilities by analyzing data from a large sample consisting of multiple cohorts with birth years from 1981 to 1988. Their average age at first referral was 13.97 and ranged between Sand 19. The data was obtained from the South Carolina Department of juvenile justice (SCDJJ) Management Information System. We used survival/hazards analyses to examine patterns of repeat offending; censoring was considered for age 21, as this ended the potential time for a juvenile offense to occur by definition. It was found that offenders with disabilities had much higher risks for second and third referrals than those without disabilities and had their first contact with the juvenile justice system at an earlier age. The average time it took for an offender with a disability to be referred again was 2.75 years, compared to 7 years for those without disabilities. There is a need to develop intervention strategies that meet the unique needs of offenders with disabilities. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Standard on-chip transmission lines are used as pulse forming lines (PFLs), while CMOS transistors are used as switches. The shortest output pulses of these circuits are analyzed and compared through Cadence Spectre simulations. All the CMOS circuits are fabricated in the commercial technology. Pulses of similar to 170 ps durations and 120-400 mV amplitudes are obtained when the power supply is tuned from 1.2 to 2 V. The results show that these traditional PFL based circuits can be implemented in standard CMOS technology for high power short pulse generations. Furthermore, the PFL circuits significantly extend the short pulse generation capabilities of CMOS technologies. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

J	Akisetty, Chandra; Xiao, Feipeng; Gandhi, Tejash; Amirkhanian, Serji								Estimating correlations between rheological and engineering properties of rubberized asphalt concrete mixtures containing warm mix asphalt additive								CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS				25	2	SI		950	956		10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2010.06.087			FEB 2011	2011	In recent years, warm mix asphalt (WMA) is widely used for reducing energy requirements and emissions in hot mix asphalt (HMA) industry. In addition, the use of rubberized asphalt in the past has proven to be economical, environmentally sound and effective in improving the performance of pavements across the US and the world. The objective of this research was to investigate the mixture performance characteristics of rubberized warm asphalt mixtures, and their correlation with binder properties, through a series of laboratory tests (e.g., viscosity, dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), and bending beam rheometer (BBR)) conducted on the binders, and obtaining the indirect tensile strength, rutting resistance, and resilient modulus of various mixtures. The results of the experiments indicated that the use of crumb rubber and WMA additive in HMA can effectively improve the engineering properties of these mixes at lower mixing and compacting temperatures and some statistical correlations between rheological and/or engineering properties were developed successfully.

Lifting the Fundamental Cone and Enumerating the Pseudocodewords of a Parity-Check Code								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY				57	2			898	909		10.1109/TIT.2010.2095071			FEB 2011	2011	The performance of message-passing iterative decoding and linear programming decoding depends on the Tanner graph representation of the code. If the underlying graph contains cycles, then such algorithms could produce a noncodeword output. The study of pseudocodewords aims to explain this noncodeword output. We examine the structure of the pseudocodewords and show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between graph cover pseudocodewords and integer points in a lifted fundamental cone. This gives a simple proof that the generating function of the pseudocodewords for a general parity-check code is rational (a fact first proved by Li, Lu, and Wang (Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 5557, 2009) via other methods). Our approach yields algorithms for producing this generating function and provides tools for studying the irreducible pseudocodewords. Specifically, Barvinok's algorithm and the Barvinok-Woods projection algorithm are applied, and irreducible pseudocodewords are found via a Hilbert basis for the lifted fundamental cone.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0018-9448	1557-9654		WOS:000286514200020		
J	Baker, Thomas L.; Meyer, Tracy								White Response to Potentially Discriminatory Actions in a Services Setting								PSYCHOLOGY & MARKETING				28	2			188	204		10.1002/mar.20386			FEB 2011	2011	Discrimination in the marketplace is a significant problem for many blacks and for service providers. However, recent research suggests that some whites may respond similarly to blacks when they witness what they perceive to be a discriminatory act in a service encounter. Using an experimental design methodology, this research investigates the extent to which this occurs. The degree to which an observing customer values the other customer's welfare and feels empathy has been found to explain differences in service failure perceptions among white study participants. White participants high in empathy for blacks were found to react similarly to blacks relative to the inherent negativity of the service failure. This suggests that a service failure involving black customers that hints of discrimination has a greater overall impact on the long-term success of the service firm than originally envisioned.

Characterization of glycidyl methacrylate - Crosslinked hyaluronan hydrogel scaffolds incorporating elastogenic hyaluronan oligomers								ACTA BIOMATERIALIA				7	2			653	665		10.1016/j.actbio.2010.08.006			FEB 2011	2011	Prior studies on two-dimensional cell cultures suggest that hyaluronic acid (HA) stimulates cell-mediated regeneration of extracellular matrix structures, specifically those containing elastin, though such biologic effects are dependent on HA fragment size. Towards being able to regenerate three-dimensional (3-D) elastic tissue constructs, the present paper studies photo-crosslinked hydrogels containing glycidyl methacrylate (GM)-derivatized bio-inert high molecular weight (HMW) HA (1 x 10(6) Da) and a bioactive HA oligomer mixture (HA-o: MW similar to 0.75 kDa). The mechanical (rheology, degradation) and physical (apparent crosslinking density, swelling ratio) properties of the gels varied as a function of incorporated HA oligomer content; however, overall, the mechanics of these hydrogels were too weak for vascular applications as stand-alone materials. Upon in vivo subcutaneous implantation, only a few inflammatory cells were evident around GM-HA gels, however their number increased as HA-o content within the gels increased, and the collagen I distribution was uniform. Smooth muscle cells (SMC) were encapsulated into GM hydrogels, and calcein acetoxymethyl detection revealed that the cells were able to endure twofold the level of UV exposure used to crosslink the gels. After 21 days of culture, SMC elastin production, measured by immunofluorescence quantification, showed HA-o to increase cellular deposition of elastic matrix twofold relative to HA-o-free GM-HA gels. These results demonstrate that cell response to HA/HA-o is not altered by their methacrylation and photo-crosslinking into a hydrogel, and that HA-o incorporation into cell-encapsulating hydrogel scaffolds can be useful for enhancing their production of elastic matrix structures in a 3-D space, important for regenerating elastic tissues.

Signal propagation analysis shows that periodically loaded CMOS TLs exhibit filter properties, which cause attenuation and deformation of signal pulses. Nevertheless, the dispersion effects on clock pulse propagation are minimal since clock lines are short, much shorter than the meandered input-signal line. Design considerations on clock pulse generator, sampling switches, and charge amplifiers are presented. Compared with other CMOS approaches, the proposed SHC generates clock pulses on chip and avoids clock jitter difficulties. The SHC is implemented in a 0.13 mu m digital CMOS process with standard on-chip coplanar waveguides (CPW) as signal and clock pulse propagation TLs, silicon N-type field effect transistors (NFET) as sampling switches, and high-frequency charge amplifiers for charge amplification. Clock pulse signals of similar to 50 ps width with similar to 17 ps fall edge are generated on-chip. Simulation analysis with Cadence Spectre shows that a sampling rate of 20 Gigasample/s with a 25 dB spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) can be achieved. With shorter clock pulses, both sampling rate and SFDR can be improved in future design.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0925-1030			WOS:000287398700012

Without sacrificing the self-resonance frequency and increasing the DC power consumption of the main circuit, the feedback transistor introduces a negative resistance; therefore, high Q-factors can be achieved in a wide operating frequency range. The proposed inductor was designed in a 0.13 mu m CMOS process and simulated using Cadence Spectre. The active area is similar to 4 mu m x 5 mu m. With similar to 0.1 mW power consumption, the designed active inductor shows a 17 GHz maximum self-resonance frequency and a 1-8 GHz peak-Qoperating frequency range. Using this active inductor, a 3-bit digitally-controlled phase shifter was designed. The phase shifter can provide a phase shift range larger than 180 degrees from 1.5 to 4 GHz and a return loss better than 10 dB.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0925-1030	1573-1979		WOS:000287398700019

Recent studies, however, have demonstrated that the urothelium is sensitive to mechanical stimuli and responds by releasing signaling molecules (NO, ATP). This study sought to investigate the role of select ion channels in urothelial cell (UC) pressure mechanotransduction. Using a custom-made pressure chamber, rat bladder UCs cultured on tissue culture plastic dishes were exposed to sustained hydrostatic pressure (5-20 cmH(2)O) for up to 30 min. When compared to the control, UCs exposed to 10 cmH(2)O (5 min), and 15 cmH(2)O (5 and 15 min), exhibited a significant (p < 0.05) increase in ATP release. In the absence of extracellular calcium, ATP release due to hydrostatic pressure was attenuated. Blocking the L-type voltage-gated channel with nifedipine during pressure exposure did not affect ATP release. However, blocking TRP channels, stretch-activated channels (SACs), and the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) with ruthenium red, gadolinium chloride, and amiloride, respectively, all abolished hydrostatic pressure-evoked ATP release. These results have provided evidence for the first time that cultured UCs are sensitive to hydrostatic pressure in the physiologically relevant range. The results of this study also provide evidence that one or multiple mechanosensitive ion channels play a role in the mechanotransduction of hydrostatic pressure, which supports the view that not only tissue stretch or tension, but also pressure is an important parameter for mechanosensing of bladder fullness.									30	1	0	27	0	31			0090-6964			WOS:000287213300007	21104316

Here, we study attachment of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and anti-glutamate N-methyl D-aspartate receptor 1 (NR1) antibody to PBCA NPs with the ultimate goal to design neuroprotective therapeutics for treatment of secondary spinal cord injury. Synthesis of monodispersed, similar to 200 nm-diameter PBCA NPs was performed using polymerization at pH 2.0 with Dextran 70,000 as the stabilizer. Sulfo-HSAB spacers were used to covalently attach SOD and NR1 antibodies to the dextran-coated NPs. The prepared protein-NP conjugates possessed SOD activity and were capable of binding to rat cerebellar neurons. Thus, SOD and NR1 antibodies may be simultaneously attached to PBCA NPs while retaining at least a fraction of enzymatic activity and receptor-binding ability. The conjugates showed neuroprotective efficacy in vitro with rat cerebellar cell cultures challenged by superoxide. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2011;108: 243-252.

Chefs' Opinions About Reducing the Calorie Content of Menu Items in Restaurants								OBESITY				19	2			332	337		10.1038/oby.2010.188			FEB 2011	2011	Modifying the energy content of foods, particularly foods eaten away from home, is important in addressing the obesity epidemic. Chefs in the restaurant industry are uniquely placed to influence the provision of reduced-calorie foods, but little is known about their opinions on this issue. A survey was conducted among chefs attending US culinary meetings about strategies for creating reduced-calorie foods and opportunities for introducing such items on restaurant menus. The 432 respondents were from a wide variety of employment positions and the majority had been in the restaurant industry for >= 20 years. Nearly all chefs (93%) thought that the calories in menu items could be reduced by 10-25% without customers noticing. To decrease the calories in two specific foods, respondents were more likely to select strategies for reducing energy density than for reducing portion size (P < 0.004). Low consumer demand was identified as the greatest barrier to including reduced-calorie items on the menu by 38% of chefs, followed by the need for staff skills and training (24%), and high ingredient cost (18%). The majority of respondents (71%) ranked taste as the most influential factor in the success of reduced-calorie items (P < 0.0001). The results of this survey indicate that opportunities exist for reducing the energy content of restaurant items. Ongoing collaboration is needed between chefs and public health professionals to ensure that appealing reduced-calorie menu items are more widely available in restaurants and that research is directed toward effective ways to develop and promote these items.									10	0	0	3	1	10			1930-7381	1930-739X		WOS:000286651400016	20814414

Development of a Robust and Cost-Effective Friction Stir Welding Process for Use in Advanced Military Vehicles								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				20	1			11	23		10.1007/s11665-010-9650-0			FEB 2011	2011	To respond to the advent of more lethal threats, recently designed aluminum-armor-based military-vehicle systems have resorted to an increasing use of higher strength aluminum alloys (with superior ballistic resistance against armor piercing (AP) threats and with high vehicle-light weighing potential). Unfortunately, these alloys are not very amenable to conventional fusion-based welding technologies and in-order to obtain high-quality welds, solid-state joining technologies such as Friction stir welding (FSW) have to be employed. However, since FSW is a relatively new and fairly complex joining technology, its introduction into advanced military vehicle structures is not straight forward and entails a comprehensive multi-step approach. One such (three-step) approach is developed in the present work. Within the first step, experimental and computational techniques are utilized to determine the optimal tool design and the optimal FSW process parameters which result in maximal productivity of the joining process and the highest quality of the weld. Within the second step, techniques are developed for the identification and qualification of the optimal weld joint designs in different sections of a prototypical military vehicle structure. In the third step, problems associated with the fabrication of a sub-scale military vehicle test structure and the blast survivability of the structure are assessed. The results obtained and the lessons learned are used to judge the potential of the current approach in shortening the development time and in enhancing reliability and blast survivability of military vehicle structures.									24	1	0	0	0	24			1059-9495			WOS:000286212500002

Fifteen wavelengths are monitored on each of 30 laser beams to reconstruct the temperature image in a 381 mm x 381 mm square room-temperature plane that contains a 102 mm x 102 mm square zone of lower or higher temperature. The hyperspectral tomography technique attempts to leverage multispectral information to enhance measurement fidelity. The experimental temperature images exhibit average accuracies of 2.3% or better, with pixel-by-pixel standard deviations of less than 1%. In addition, even when the internal zone is only 4 K cooler than the surroundings, its presence is still detectable; statistical analysis of the associated experimental image reveals a 98% confidence that the internal zone is in fact cooler than the surroundings.

While accretion onto T Tauri stars has been studied extensively, little work has been done on measuring the accretion rate of their intermediate-mass analogs, the Herbig Ae/Be stars. Measuring the stellar accretion rate of Herbig Ae/Bes is not straightforward both because of the dearth of metal absorption lines available for veiling measurements and the intrinsic brightness of Herbig Ae/Be stars at ultraviolet wavelengths where the brightness of the accretion shock peaks. Alternative approaches to measuring the accretion rate of young stars by measuring the luminosity of proxies such as the Br gamma emission line have not been calibrated. A promising approach is the measurement of the veiling of the Balmer discontinuity. We present measurements of this veiling as well as the luminosity of Br gamma. We show that the relationship between the luminosity of Br. and the stellar accretion rate for classical T Tauri stars is consistent with Herbig Ae stars but not Herbig Be stars. We discuss the implications of this finding for understanding the interaction of the star and disk for Herbig Ae/Be stars.									50	0	0	0	0	50			0004-6256			WOS:000286186100018

Complemented by our previously published spectroscopy, this high-quality photometric data set allows us to solve for the extinction properties of the redshift 3.036 sightline, giving perhaps the most detailed information to date on the ultraviolet continuum absorption properties of any sightline outside our Local Group. The extinction properties are not adequately modeled by any ordinary extinction template (including the average Milky Way, Large Magellanic Cloud, and Small Magellanic Cloud curves), partially because the 2175 angstrom feature (while present) is weaker by about a factor of two than when seen under similar circumstances locally. However, the spectral energy distribution is exquisitely fitted by the more general Fitzpatrick & Massa parameterization of Local-Group extinction, putting it in the same family as some peculiar Milky Way extinction curves. After correcting for this (considerable, A(V) = 3.3 +/- 0.4 mag) extinction, GRB 080607 is revealed to have been among the most optically luminous events ever observed, comparable to the naked-eye burst GRB 080319B. Its early peak time (t(rest) < 6 s) indicates a high initial Lorentz factor (Gamma > 600), while the extreme luminosity may be explained in part by a large circumburst density. Only because of its early high luminosity could the afterglow of GRB 080607 be studied in such detail in spite of the large attenuation and great distance, making this burst an excellent prototype for the understanding of other highly obscured extragalactic objects, and of the class of "dark" GRBs in particular.									36	1	0	0	0	36			0004-6256			WOS:000286186100008

The quick and precise localization of GRBs by the Swift telescope allows the early evolution of the afterglow light curve to be captured by ground-based telescopes. With GROND measurements we can investigate the optical/near-infrared light curve of the afterglow of gamma-ray burst 080413B in the context of late rebrightening.Methods. Multi-wavelength follow-up observations were performed on the afterglow of GRB 080413B. X-ray emission was detected by the X-ray telescope onboard the Swift satellite and obtained from the public archive. Optical and near-infrared photometry was performed with the seven-channel imager GROND mounted at the MPG/ESO 2.2 m telescope and additionally with the REM telescope, both in La Silla, Chile. The light curve model was constructed using the obtained broad-band data.Results. The broad-band light curve of the afterglow of GRB 080413B is well fitted with an on-axis two-component jet model. The narrow ultra-relativistic jet is responsible for the initial decay, while the rise of the moderately relativistic wider jet near its deceleration time is the cause of the rebrightening of the light curve. The later evolution of the optical/NIR light curve is then dominated by the wide component, the signature of which is almost negligible in the X-ray wavelengths. These components have opening angles of theta(n) similar to 1.7 degrees and theta(w) similar to 9 degrees, and Lorentz factors of Gamma(n) > 188 and Gamma(w) similar to 18.5. We calculated the beaming-corrected energy release to be E-gamma = 7.9 x 10(48) erg.									27	1	0	0	0	27			0004-6361			WOS:000286458400125

Thirteen years after the discovery of the first afterglows, the nature of dark gamma-ray bursts (GRB) still eludes explanation: while each long-duration GRB typically has an X-ray afterglow, optical/NIR emission is only seen for 40-60% of them.Aims. Here we use the afterglow detection statistics of the systematic follow-up observations performed with GROND since mid-2007 in order to derive the fraction of "dark bursts" according to different methods, and to distinguish between various scenarios for "dark bursts".Methods. Observations were performed with the 7-channel "Gamma-Ray Optical and Near-infrared Detector" (GROND) at the 2.2 m MPI/ESO telescope. We used the afterglow detection rate in dependence on the delay time between GRB and the first GROND exposure.Results. For long-duration Swift bursts with a detected X-ray afterglow, we achieve a 90% (35/39) detection rate of optical/NIR afterglows whenever our observations started within less than 240 min after the burst. Complementing our GROND data with Swift/XRT spectra we construct broad-band spectral energy distributions and derive rest-frame extinctions.Conclusions. We detect 25-40% "dark bursts", depending on the definition used. The faint optical afterglow emission of "dark bursts" is mainly due to a combination of two contributing factors: (i) moderate intrinsic extinction at moderate redshifts, and (ii) about 22% of "dark" bursts at redshift >5.									98	0	0	0	0	98			1432-0746			WOS:000286458400042

We present a framework to obtain photometric redshifts (photo-zs) for gamma-ray burst afterglows. Using multi-band photometry from GROND and Swift/UVOT, photo-zs are derived for five GRBs for which spectroscopic redshifts are not available.Methods. We use UV/optical/NIR data and synthetic photometry based on afterglow observations and theory to derive the photometric redshifts of GRBs and their accuracy. Taking into account the afterglow synchrotron emission properties, we investigate the application of photometry to derive redshifts in a theoretical range between z similar to 1 to z similar to 12.Results. The measurement of photo-zs for GRB afterglows provides a quick, robust and reliable determination of the distance scale to the burst, particularly in those cases where spectroscopic observations in the optical/NIR range cannot be obtained. Given a sufficiently bright and mildly reddened afterglow, the relative photo-z accuracy eta = Delta z/(1 + z) is better than 10% between z = 1.5 and z similar to 7 and better than 5% between z = 2 and z = 6. We detail the approach on 5 sources without spectroscopic redshifts observed with UVOT on-board Swift and/or GROND. The distance scale to those same afterglows is measured to be z = 4.31(-0.15)(+ 0.14) for GRB 080825B, z = 2.13(-0.20)(+0.14) for GRB 080906, z = 3.44(-0.32)(+0.15) for GRB 081228, z = 2.03(-0.14)(+0.16) for GRB 081230 and z = 1.28(-0.15)(+0.16) for GRB 090530.Conclusions. Due to the exceptional luminosity and simple continuum spectrum of GRB afterglows, photometric redshifts can be obtained to an accuracy as good as eta similar to 0.03 over a large redshift range including robust (eta similar to 0.1) measurements in the ultra-high redshift regime (z greater than or similar to 7). Combining the response from UVOT with ground-based observatories and in particular GROND operating in the optical/NIR wavelength regime, reliable photo-zs can be obtained from z similar to 1.0 out to z similar to 10, and possibly even at higher redshifts in some favorable cases, provided that these GRBs exist, are localized quickly, have sufficiently bright afterglows and are not heavily obscured.									25	0	0	0	0	25			1432-0746			WOS:000286458400165

An interesting observation was that the quenching of luminescence emissions in the aqueous suspended carbon nanoparticles by aliphatic amines deviated from the classical Stern-Volmer behavior in a somewhat unusual fashion, exhibiting reversed quenching (increasing luminescence intensities) at very low quencher concentrations. The implication of the observation to the mechanistic framework that may account for photoluminescence emissions in both functionalized and naked carbon nanoparticles is proposed and discussed.									18	0	0	2	0	18			0008-4042			WOS:000287150300004

Molecular structures for the oligomeric constituents of petroleum pitch								CARBON				49	2			636	651		10.1016/j.carbon.2010.10.011			FEB 2011	2011	Individual dimer, trimer, and tetramer constituents that comprise the higher molecular weight (mol wt), mesophase-forming fraction of M-50 petroleum pitch were characterized in terms of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) backbone structure, the extent of alkylation, and the nature of the bonds connecting the monomeric "building blocks" comprising the oligomeric species. Isolation of individual oligomeric constituents for subsequent analysis and identification was made possible by applying our two-step, sequential fractionation technique of dense-gas/supercritical extraction (DGE) followed by prep-scale gel permeation chromatography (GPC). MALDI and MALDI-post source decay (PSD) mass spectrometry of the narrow mol wt fractions obtained indicate that the major oligomeric constituents are grouped in terms of well-defined molecular weight distributions, with each composed of base monomer PAH backbone structure(s) (e.g., pyrene, triphenylene, benzopyrenes, chrysene, and benz[a]anthracene) possessing various degrees (typically 1-4/monomer unit) of methylation. UV-Vis analysis indicates that the oligomerization process occurs via a condensation reaction, with the loss of four hydrogens as a nonalternant, 5-membered PAH ring forms to join the reacting monomer units. FT-IR spectroscopy indicates that this reaction results in relatively uncondensed structures over the entire range of oligomers investigated. Analogous results to those given above were obtained for the thermal polymerization of an anthracene pitch. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Participants included both undergraduates and older adults. Results generally supported the model, with the interaction effect between self-disclosure and social connection directly predicting Facebook communication and indirectly predicting relational closeness. For both dependent variables, online social connection was a positive predictor at low and moderate levels of online self-disclosure, but high levels reduced the association to nonsignificance. One implication of these results was that high-warrant information may discourage those with social anxiety from social network site communication.									69	1	1	0	0	70			0093-6502			WOS:000285962200002

This work demonstrates a continuous separation of particles by size in a serpentine microchannel using negative dielectrophoresis. Depending on the magnitude of the turn-induced dielectrophoretic force, particles travelling electro-kinetically through a serpentine channel either migrate toward the centerline or bounce between the two sidewalls. These distinctive focusing and bouncing phenomena are utilized to implement a dielectrophoretic separation of 1 and 3 mm polystyrene particles under a DC-biased AC electric field of 880 V/cm on average. The particle separation process in the entire microchannel is simulated by a numerical model.									14	0	0	4	0	14			0173-0835			WOS:000288094500006	21290386

Here, we have demonstrated that the bioflavanoid quercetin (QCN), a known trypanocide, is a mixed inhibitor of Trypanosome brucei hexokinase 1 (TbHK1) (IC(50) = 4.1 +/- 0.8 mu M). Spectroscopic analysis of QCN binding to TbHK1, taking advantage of the intrinsically fluorescent single tryptophan (Trp177) in TbHK1, revealed that QCN quenches emission of Trp177, which is located near the hinge region of the enzyme. ATP similarly quenched Trp177 emission, while glucose had no impact on fluorescence.Supporting the possibility that QCN toxicity is a consequence of inhibition of the essential hexokinase, in live parasites QCN fluorescence localizes to glycosomes, the subcellular home of TbHK1. Additionally, RNAi-mediated silencing of TbHK1 expression expedited QCN induced death, while over-expressing TbHK1 protected trypanosomes from the compound. In summary, these observations support the suggestion that QCN toxicity is in part attributable to inhibition of the essential TbHK1. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Targeted gene disruption showed that the cyp51A, -B or -C disruption mutants were morphologically indistinguishable from the parent isolate on potato dextrose agar medium, which indicates that none of these genes is essential for mycelial growth. The sensitivity of cyp51A deletion mutants to seven sterol demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicides increased significantly compared to the parent strain, while sensitivity of cyp51C deletion mutants increased to some but not all DMIs. No change in DMI sensitivity was observed for cyp51B deletion mutants. The parental phenotypes of cyp51A and cyp51C deletion mutants were completely restored by genetic complementation with the wild-type cyp51A and cyp51C genes, respectively. The sensitivity of F. graminearum isolates increased significantly when subjected in vitro to a mixture of DMI fungicides triadimefon and tebuconazole as compared to the individual components. These results indicate that different DMI fungicides target different CYP51 proteins in F. graminearum and that a mixture of DMI fungicides can result in synergistic effects. Our findings have directly implications on chemical management strategies of plant diseases caused by Fusarium species. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Tumor has about half the electrical resistivity of normal tissue below 20 kHz, but similar resistivity above 500 kHz. We placed normal porcine liver tissue in contact with agar gel having similar resistivity as tumor within 20-450 kHz. A needle electrode was placed with half of the electrically active tip in each layer. We performed ablation with electric current applied for 12 min at 30 W, either at 20 or 450 kHz (n = 7 each), while measuring temperature via thermocouples 4 and 8 mm from the electrode. Mathematical heat-transfer models were created of an equivalent configuration and temperature profile determined at both frequencies. At 8-mm distance, at 450 kHz, tumor gel phantom and normal tissue obtained similar temperatures (57.5 +/- 1.4 versus 58.7 +/- 2.5 degrees C); at 20 kHz, tumor phantom obtained significantly higher temperatures than normal tissue (65.6 +/- 2.0 versus 57.2 +/- 5.6 degrees C, p < 0.01). Computer models confirm these results, and show the ablation zone diameter to be larger within the tumor phantom at 20 kHz compared to 450 kHz. Heating at low RFs may thus allow targeted heating of tumor tissue and reduced heating of normal tissue.									17	0	0	5	0	18			0018-9294			WOS:000286514500022	20934940

While many modified LIFT-based cell direct writing successes have been achieved, possible process-induced cell injury and death is still a big hurdle for modified LIFT-based cell direct writing to be a viable technology. The objective of this study is to propose metallic foil-assisted LIFT using a four-layer structure to achieve better droplet size control and increase cell viability in direct writing of human colon cancer cells (HT-29). The proposed four layers include a quartz disk, a sacrificial and adhesive layer, a metallic foil, and a cell suspension layer. The bubble formation-induced stress wave is responsible for droplet formation. It is found that the proposed metallic foil-assisted LIFT approach is an effective cell direct-write technology and provides better printing resolution and high post-transfer cell viability when compared with other conventional modified LIFT technologies such as matrix-assisted pulsed-laser evaporation direct-write; at the same time, the possible contamination from the laser energy absorbing material is minimized using a metallic foil.

Novel tissue-derived biomimetic scaffold for regenerating the human nucleus pulposus								JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A				96A	2			422	435		10.1002/jbm.a.33001			FEB 2011	2011	Numerous scaffold formulations have been investigated to support the regeneration of nucleus pulposus (NP) tissue for use as an early-stage therapy for intervertebral disc degeneration. Particular attention has focused on recreating the biochemical and mechanical properties of the native NP via the incorporation of exogenous extracellular matrix (ECM) components or synthetic surrogates. In the present study, we describe a novel approach to develop a tissue engineering (TE) scaffold comprised acellular porcine NP ECM. Complete decellularization of porcine NP was successfully achieved using a combination of chemical detergents, ultrasonication, and treatment with nucleases. Resulting NP scaffolds were devoid of host-cell remnants and the porcine antigen alphaGal. Native NP ECM components including aggrecan/chon-droitin-6-sulfate and collagens types II, IX, and XI were found in physiologically relevant ratios within the NP scaffold. NP scaffold swelling capacity and unconfined mechanical properties were not significantly different from porcine NP tissue. Furthermore, NP scaffolds were conducive to repopulation with human adipose-derived stem cells as cell viability and proliferative capacity were maintained. These results demonstrate the successful decellularization of porcine NP and the resultant formation of a biomimetic scaffold exhibiting potential utility for TE the human NP.

Herein, the damage potential index (DPI), which is a function of angular distortion and lateral strain, is used to assess building damage potential. A serviceability limit state is established in which the resistance is expressed in terms of the "limiting" DPI, and the load is represented by the "applied" DPI. In this context, damage to the building adjacent to an excavation is said to occur deterministically if the applied DPI is greater than the limiting DPI. For the fully probabilistic analysis, both parameter and model uncertainties of the limiting and applied DPIs are first characterized. The analysis framework is then presented and demonstrated with a case history. Finally, sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the factors to which the probability of damage is most sensitive and to analyze the effect of various assumptions of the input parameters on the computed probability of building damage.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1090-0241			WOS:000286218300002

Different orders are grouped into one job because orders of an individual customer very often fill only a portion of a Front-Opening Unified Pod (FOUP). After job formation, an FOUP is assigned to each job and is used to move the job throughout the wafer fab. We determine an acceptable number of FOUPs given a prescribed order release rate to find appropriate values for on-time delivery performance measures, cycle time, and throughput by discrete event simulation. On the other hand, given a prescribed number of FOUPs and target values for these performance measures, we look for an appropriate order release rate. Simulation experiments with models for large-scale wafer fabs are performed to solve these two problems.

When Science, Politics, and Policy Collide: On the Regulation of Anabolic-Androgenic Steroids, Steroid Precursors, and "Dietary Supplements" in the United States								JOURNAL OF SPORT & SOCIAL ISSUES				35	1			3	21		10.1177/0193723510396673			FEB 2011	2011	Twenty years after policy makers passed the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 1990, adding steroids to the list of Schedule III Controlled Substances in the United States, illicit use of the drugs continues among both adolescents and adults in American society. Some of the men and women who use steroids seek enhanced athletic performance, whereas others simply want to appear more muscular. But what, exactly, is a "steroid"? The present article examines legislation surrounding actual anabolic-androgenic steroids, steroid precursors, and associated "dietary supplements," exploring how the political interests of policy actors and the economic interests of industry lobbies have compromised regulatory efforts. Among the issues addressed are the arbitrary assignment of substances to (and exemption from) the Omnibus Controlled Substances Act and the retailing of "dietary supplements" that contain widely varying amounts of active ingredients and, in some cases, synthetic steroids. Conceptually, the article draws on the "garbage can" model of policy processes as well as the broader public arenas model of social problems, focusing on subjective issue constructions and symbolic appeals.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0193-7235			WOS:000287127200001		
J	Gacchina, Carmen E.; Ramamurthi, Anand								Impact of pre-existing elastic matrix on TGF beta 1 and HA oligomer-induced regenerative elastin repair by rat aortic smooth muscle cells								JOURNAL OF TISSUE ENGINEERING AND REGENERATIVE MEDICINE				5	2			85	96		10.1002/term.286			FEB 2011	2011	Regenerating elastic matrices lost to disease (e. g. in aneurysms) is vital to re-establishing vascular homeostasis but is challenged by the poor elastogenicity of post-neonatal cells. We previously showed that exogenous hyaluronan oligomers (HA-o) and TGF beta 1 synergistically enhance tropo- and matrix elastin deposition by healthy adult rat aortic SMCs (RASMCs). Towards treating aortic aneurysms (AAs), which exhibit cause-and site-specific heterogeneity in matrix content/structure and contain proteolytically-injured SMCs, we investigated the impact of pre-existing elastic matrix degeneration on elastogenic induction of injured RASMCs. Elastin-rich RASMC layers at 21 days of culture were treated with 0.15 U/ml (PPE15) and 0.75 U/ml (PPE75) porcine pancreatic elastase to degrade the elastic matrix variably, or left uninjured (control). One set of cultures was harvested at 21 days, before and after injury, to quantify viable cell count, matrix elastin loss. Other injured cell layers were cultured to 42 days with or without factors (0.2 mu g/ml HA oligomers, 1 ng/ml TGF beta 1). We showed that: (a) the ability of cultures to self-repair and regenerate elastic matrices following proteolysis is limited when elastolysis is severe; (b) HA oligomers and TGF beta 1 elastogenically stimulate RASMCs in mildly-injured (i.e. PPE15) cultures to restore both elastic matrix amounts and elastic fibre deposition to levels in healthy cultures; and (c) in severely injured (i.e. PPE75) cultures, the factors stimulate matrix elastin synthesis and crosslinking, although not to control levels. The outcomes underscore the need to enhance elastogenic factor doses based on the severity of elastin loss. This study will help in customizing therapies for elastin regeneration within AAs, based on cause and location.

J	Masana, Ravindra; Daqaq, Mohammed F.								Electromechanical Modeling and Nonlinear Analysis of Axially Loaded Energy Harvesters								JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND ACOUSTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME				133	1					011007	10.1115/1.4002786			FEB 2011	2011	To maximize the electromechanical transduction of vibratory energy harvesters, the resonance frequency of the harvesting device is usually tuned to the excitation frequency. To achieve this goal, some concepts call for utilizing an axial static preload to soften or stiffen the structure (Leland and Wright, 2006, "Resonance Tuning of Piezoelectric Vibration Energy Scavenging Generators Using Compressive Axial Preload," Smart Mater. Struct., 15, pp. 1413-1420; Morris et al., 2008, " A Resonant Frequency Tunable, Extensional Mode Piezoelectric Vibration Harvesting Mechanism," Smart Mater. Struct., 17, p. 065021). For the most part, however, models used to describe the effect of the axial preload on the harvester's response are linear lumped-parameter models that can hide some of the essential features of the dynamics and, sometimes, oppose the experimental trends. To resolve this issue, this study aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of energy harvesting using axially loaded beams. Specifically, using nonlinear Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, an electromechanical model of a clamped-clamped energy harvester subjected to transversal excitations and static axial loading is developed and discretized using a Galerkin expansion. Using the method of multiple scales, the general nonlinear physics of the system is investigated by obtaining analytical expressions for the steady-state response amplitude, the voltage drop across a resistive load, and the output power. These theoretical expressions are then validated against experimental data. It is demonstrated that in addition to the ability of tuning the harvester to the excitation frequency via axial load variations, the axial load aids in (i) increasing the electric damping in the system, thereby enhancing the energy transfer from the beam to the electric load, (ii) amplifying the effect of the external excitation on the structure, and (iii) enhancing the effective nonlinearity of the device. These factors combined can increase the steady-state response amplitude, output power, and bandwidth of the harvester.

In this paper, the elastic limits of hexagonal honeycombs including the ones having negative Poisson's ratios (NPR) are explored with various cell geometries under simple shear loading. While designing a shear modulus, e.g., G(12)(center dot) of 10 MPa, of hexagonal honeycombs, corresponding meso-structures are designed with three constituent materials; an aluminum alloy (7075-T6). a titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V), and a high strength steel (ANSI 4340). The in-plane linear elastic honeycomb model is employed to achieve the shear moduli of the hexagonal honeycombs made of the three constituent materials. The shear strengths, (tau(center dot)(pl))(12) and shear yield strains, (gamma(center dot)(pl))(12) of hexagonal honeycombs are obtained from finite element analysis using ABAQUS. The titanium alloy honeycombs show a good shear flexure property having both high (tau(center dot)(pl))(12) and (gamma(center dot)(pl))(12) when it is designed to the target G(12)(center dot). The re-entrant geometry makes honeycombs flexible associated with a high effective bending length. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The highest peak ZT of a p-type half-Heusler has been so far reported about 0.5 due to the high thermal conductivity. Through a nanocomposite approach using ball milling and hot pressing, we have achieved a peak ZT of 0.8 at 700 degrees C, which is about 60% higher than the best reported 0.5 and might be good enough for consideration for waste heat recovery in car exhaust systems. The improvement comes from a simultaneous increase in Seebeck coefficient and a significant decrease in thermal conductivity due to nanostructures. The samples were made by first forming alloyed ingots using arc melting and then creating nanopowders by ball milling the ingots and finally obtaining dense bulk by hot pressing. Further improvement in ZT is expected when average grain sizes are made smaller than 100 nm.									159	0	0	4	0	159			1530-6984			WOS:000287049100042	21186782	
J	Pulikanti, R.; Peebles, E. D.; Gerard, P. D.								Physiological responses of broiler embryos to in ovo implantation of temperature transponders								POULTRY SCIENCE				90	2			308	313		10.3382/ps.2010-00936			FEB 1 2011	2011	Previous techniques that have been used to monitor broiler embryonic temperature and metabolism during incubation either have been invasive to the embryo or have not directly determined internal egg temperature. Therefore, the current investigation was conducted to determine the earliest day of incubation on which temperature transponder implantation in the egg air cell could be performed with minimal invasiveness to broiler embryogenesis. Eggs from young broiler breeder hens (Ross 308; 27 wk of age) were weighed and set on 3 tray levels (approximately 120 eggs per tray level) of a single incubator. Randomly, on each tray level and on each day between d 10 and 14 of incubation, 4 embryonated eggs were assigned to an invasive control (IC) treatment (shell perforation only) and 4 other embryonated eggs were assigned to a transponder implantation (TI) treatment (shell perforation, followed by transponder implantation in the air cell). Four embryonated eggs per tray were also assigned to a noninvasive control treatment on d 10 of incubation. Percentage of embryo survivability through d 18 of incubation, and percentages of mean daily incubational egg weight loss between d 18 and each respective day of implantation were calculated. Furthermore, various internal organ and tissue parameters were examined on d 18 of incubation. Embryo survivability was reduced because of transponder implantation on d 10 and 11 of incubation; however, embryo survivability was not different between eggs in the noninvasive control and IC treatments and the eggs that received the TI treatment on d 12, 13, and 14 of incubation. In comparison with eggs in the IC treatment, those in the TI treatment had a higher percentage of embryo weight. Conversely, yolk sac moisture was significantly higher in IC-treated eggs than in TI-treated eggs. It was concluded that temperature transponders may be inserted into the air cells of broiler hatching eggs between d 12 and 14 of incubation without adversely affecting eggshell porosity or embryogenesis and without causing physiological stress to growing broiler embryos.									7	0	0	7	0	7			0032-5791			WOS:000286376600002	21248326

J	Arya, Dev P.								New Approaches Toward Recognition of Nucleic Acid Triple Helices								ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH				44	2			134	146		10.1021/ar100113q			FEB 2011	2011	A DNA duplex can be recognized sequence-specifically in the major groove by an oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN). The resulting structure is a DNA triple helix, or triplex. The scientific community has invested significant research capital in the study of DNA triplexes because of their robust potential for providing new applications, including molecular biology tools and therapeutic agents. The triplex structures have inherent instabilities, however, and the recognition of DNA triplexes by small molecules has been attempted as a means of strengthening the three-stranded complex. Over the decades, the majority of work in the field has focused on heterocycles that intercalate between the triplex bases. In this Account, we present an alternate approach to recognition and stabilization of DNA triplexes.We show that groove recognition of nucleic acid triple helices can be achieved with aminosugars. Among these aminosugars, neomycin is the most effective aminoglycoside (groove binder) for stabilizing a DNA triple helix. It stabilizes both the TAT triplex and mixed-base DNA triplexes better than known DNA minor groove binders (which usually destabilize the triplex) and polyamines. Neomycin selectively stabilizes the triplex (TAT and mixed base) without any effect on the DNA duplex. The selectivity of neomycin likely originates from its potential and shape complementarity to the triplex Watson-Hoogsteen groove, making it the first molecule that selectively recognizes a triplex groove over a duplex groove. The groove recognition of aminoglycosides is not limited to DNA triplexes, but also extends to RNA and hybrid triple helical structures.Intercalator-neomycin conjugates are shown to simultaneously probe the base stacking and groove surface in the DNA triplex. Calorimetric and spectrosocopic studies allow the quantification of the effect of surface area of the intercalating moiety on binding to the triplex. These studies outline a novel approach to the recognition of DNA triplexes that incorporates the use of noncompeting binding sites. These principles of dual recognition should be applicable to the design of ligands that can bind any given nucleic add target with nanomolar affinities and with high selectivity.									72	0	0	45	1	72			0001-4842			WOS:000287263700006	21073199

Consequently, recent synthesis efforts have concentrated on discovery of a neutral antagonist using a variety of structural templates. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pharmacological properties of the putative neutral cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist O-2050, a sulfonamide side chain analog of Delta(8)-tetrahydrocannabinol. O-2050 and related sulfonamide cannabinoids exhibited good affinity for both cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors. While the other sulfonamide analogs produced cannabinoid agonist effects in vivo (e.g., activity suppression, antinociception, and hypothermia), O-2050 stimulated activity and was inactive in the other two tests. O-2050 also decreased food intake in mice, an effect that was reminiscent of that produced by rimonabant. Unlike rimonabant, however, O-2050 did not block the effects of cannabinoid agonists in vivo, even when administered i.c.v. In contrast, O-2050 antagonized the in vitro effects of cannabinoid agonists in [S-35]GTP gamma S and mouse vas deferens assays without having activity on its own in either assay. Further evaluation revealed that O-2050 fully and dose-dependently substituted for Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol in a mouse drug discrimination procedure (a cannabinoid agonist effect) and that it inhibited forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP signaling with a maximum efficacy of approximately half that of the full agonist CP55,940 [(-)-cis-3-[2-hydroxy-4(1,1-dimethyl-heptyl)phenyl]-trans-4-(3-hydroxy-propyl)cyclohexanol]. Together, these results suggest that O-2050 is not a viable candidate for classification as a neutral cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

S. and a cornerstone species in southeastern forests. However, genomics research on LP and other conifers has lagged behind studies on flowering plants due, in part, to the large size of conifer genomes. As a means to accelerate conifer genome research, we constructed a BAC library for the LP genotype 7-56. The LP BAC library consists of 1,824,768 individually-archived clones making it the largest single BAC library constructed to date, has a mean insert size of 96 kb, and affords 7.6X coverage of the 21.7 Gb LP genome. To demonstrate the efficacy of the library in gene isolation, we screened macroarrays with overgos designed from a pine EST anchored on LP chromosome 10. A positive BAC was sequenced and found to contain the expected full-length target gene, several gene-like regions, and both known and novel repeats. Macroarray analysis using the retrotransposon IFG-7 (the most abundant repeat in the sequenced BAC) as a probe indicates that IFG-7 is found in roughly 210,557 copies and constitutes about 5.8% or 1.26 Gb of LP nuclear DNA; this DNA quantity is eight times the Arabidopsis genome. In addition to its use in genome characterization and gene isolation as demonstrated herein, the BAC library should hasten whole genome sequencing of LP via next-generation sequencing strategies/technologies and facilitate improvement of trees through molecular breeding and genetic engineering. The library and associated products are distributed by the Clemson University Genomics Institute (www.genome.clemson.edu).									27	1	0	26	0	28			1932-6203			WOS:000286522300020	21283709

Although the method is nicely applicable for higher fullerenol, but homogeneous phase products calculate lower number of addends, whereas, the hetero phase products indicate higher value. Lower value is attributed to either overlapping of thermal events or substituents effects and higher value is the contribution of tetra butyl ammonium hydroxide (TBAH) impurity used as phase transfer catalyst (PTC) in heterogeneous phase reactions. Presence of TBAH impurity is recognized through thermo-gravimetry mass spectrometry (TG-MS) measurement. Appropriate modification of test method to arrive at accurate and precise values of x (total mass contribution due to addends only) and y (total mass contribution due to fullerene plus char yield) are also reported. Successful use of two more different techniques, viz., electron-spray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), supplement above results. Influences of fullerene and different substituents on thermal behavior of dyads are assessed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0040-6031			WOS:000287056300009

JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS				116						A01306	10.1029/2010JA015911			JAN 19 2011	2011	Numerous observations and model studies made during the past 5 years have unequivocally revealed that the ionosphere and thermosphere owe a considerable amount of their longitudinal, local time, seasonal latitudinal and day-to-day variability to waves originating in the lower part of the atmosphere. The most prominent pattern is the four-peaked ("wave 4") longitudinal structure frequently observed by (quasi-) Sun-synchronous satellites in a variety of ionospheric and thermospheric parameters. The "wave 4" has often been attributed to the diurnal, eastward, wave number 3 (DE3), nonmigrating tide alone. A more detailed analysis of TIMED observations, supported by physics-based empirical modeling and data from the CHAMP satellite, now indicates that this interpretation needs to be revised. Secondary wave generation due the nonlinear interaction between the migrating diurnal tide and the DE3 leads to a large stationary planetary wave 4 (SPW4) and a large semidiurnal, eastward wave number 2 (SE2) tide in the equatorial zonal wind at E-region heights. Combined amplitudes can equal those of the DE3. SE2 penetrates into the upper thermosphere with transequatorial wind speeds in excess of 10 m/s. This paper discusses the resulting implications for electric field generation in the E-region and tidal-ionosphere coupling in the F-region and provides observational constraints for future modeling efforts.									59	0	0	0	0	59			2169-9380	2169-9402		WOS:000286522600002

Characterization of nonjunctional hemichannels in caterpillar cells								JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE				11						6				JAN 18 2011	2011	Recent studies have demonstrated that hemichannels, which form gap junctions when paired from apposing cells, may serve additional roles when unpaired including cell adhesion and paracrine communication. Hemichannels in mammals are formed by connexins or pannexins, while in insects they are formed by pannexin homologues termed innexins. The formation of functional gap junctions by insect innexins has been established, although their ability to form functional nonjunctional hemichannels has not been reported. Here the characteristics of nonjunctional hemichannels were examined in three lepidopteran cell types, two cell lines (High Five and Sf9) and explanted hemocytes from Heliothis virescens (Fabricius) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Selective fluorescent dye uptake by hemichannels was observed in a significant minority of cells, using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Carbenoxelone, an inhibitor of mammalian junctions, disrupted dye uptake, while flufenamic acid and mefloquine did not. The presence of Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) in the media increased hemichannel activity. Additionally, lipopolysaccharide, a stimulator of immune activity in lepidopterans, decreased dye uptake. These results demonstrate for the first time the activity of nonjunctional hemichannels in insect cells, as well as pharmacological tools to manipulate them. These results will facilitate the further examination of the role of innexins and nonjunctional hemichannels in insect cell biology, including paracrine signaling, and comparative studies of mammalian pannexins and insect innexins.									10	0	0	9	0	10			1536-2442			WOS:000286476800001	21521140

The effect of temperature on the impedimetric response of bioreceptor hosting hydrogels								BIOSENSORS & BIOELECTRONICS				26	5			2275	2280		10.1016/j.bios.2010.09.050			JAN 15 2011	2011	Biocompatible hydrogels that serve as the hosting membrane for various bioreceptors contribute to the response of impedimetric biosensors. The temperature response of poly(2-hydroxymethacrylate) [p(HEMA)]-based hydrogel networks prepared with poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate (PEGMA) for enhanced biocompatibility and with N-[tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl] acrylamide (HMMA) was studied. Hydrogels were cross-linked with tetraethyleneglycol diacrylate (TEGDA) and synthesized by UV initiation (2 M% DMPA photoinitiator). The p(HEMA-co-PEGMA-co-HMMA) based hydrogels were fabricated as discrete gel pads (D=2.5 mm, H=2 mm and V=9.82 mu L) on top of 250 mu m diameter cysteamine modified and acryloyl (polyethylene glycol)110 N-hydroxy succinamide ester (acryloyl-PEG-NHS) derivatized gold microelectrodes set within 8-well (8W1E) cell culture biochips. Gel pads were fabricated with cross-link densities corresponding to 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 12M% TEGDA and were studied by frequency dependent 3-electrode electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (1 mHz to 100 kHz; 50 mV p-t-p) and by temporal 2-electrode impedimetry (64 kHz; 50 mV p-t-p) over the temperature range 30-45 degrees C at 90% RH or in aqueous 0.1 M Tris/KCl at pH 7.2 buffer. The p(HEMA-co-PEGMA-co-HMMA) hydrogels showed an increase in the real component of impedance with increasing cross-link density and demonstrated activation energies for impedimetric transport that ranged from 15 kJ/mol (3 M%) to 20 kJ/mol (12 M%) confirming the dominance of proton migration in the impedance of the hydrogels.

The basins were closed in 1988 by adding limestone and slag and then capping with a low permeability engineered cover. Groundwater (129)I concentrations in a well near the basins in 1993 were 200 pCi L(-1) and are presently between 400 and 1000 pCi L(-1). Iodine speciation in the plume contained wide ranges of iodide, iodate, and organo-iodine concentrations. First-order calculations based on a basin sediment desorption study indicate that the modest increase of 0.7 pH units detected in the study site groundwater over the last 17 years since closure of the basins may be sufficient to produce the observed increased groundwater (129)I concentrations near the basins. Groundwater monitoring of the plume at the basins has shown that the migration of many of the high risk radionuclides originally present at this complex site has been attenuated. However, (129)I continues to leave the source at a rate that may have been exacerbated by the initial remediation efforts. This study underscores the importance of identifying the appropriate in situ stabilization technologies for all source contaminants, especially if their geochemical behaviors differ.									34	0	0	20	0	34			0013-936X			WOS:000286090500025	21138294

The effects of alpha-tocopherol, transition metal, moisture, and thermal processing on oxygen scavenging capability were investigated. An initial, cup headspace oxygen content (%) of 20.9% was decreased to 18.0% after thermal processing and 60 days of storage at room temperature when the oxygen scavenging system containing alpha-tocopherol (500 mg) and transition metal (100 mg) was utilised. alpha-Tocopherol and a transition metal were required for optimum oxygen scavenging capability, otherwise the oxygen scavenging capability decreased. The oxygen content (%) decreased further to 17.1% when the amount of transition metal increased from 100 to 150 mg. In this research, alpha-tocopherol (500 mg) and transition metal (150 mg) had an oxygen scavenging capacity of 6.72 ml O(2)/g and an oxygen scavenging rate of 0.11 ml O(2)/g.day. Results indicated that alpha-tocopherol and transition metal in oxygen scavenging system coupled with thermal processing can be used as an effective oxygen scavenger. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, the effect of ammonium ion distribution on Nation conductivity was investigated for the first time. The conductivities of two kinds of contaminated membranes having uniform and non-uniform ammonium ion distributions were studied. To simulate a membrane with a well-defined ammonium ion concentration profile, three individual Nation membranes containing known amounts of ammonium ions were physically stacked together. The uniform and non-uniform cases represented membranes having three layers with the same y(NH4+) or step changes in concentration, respectively. Under fuel cell operations, the conductivities of non-uniformly poisoned membranes were ca. 1.07-1.86 times larger than those of uniformly poisoned membranes, depending on humidity, contamination level, and ammonium ion distribution. Consequently, the performance prediction of a cationic-poisoned PEMFC needs to consider any concentration gradients that may exist in MEA. The liquid-phase conductivities of composite membranes were also studied and the results show that conductivity measurements performed in deionized water are not representative of what exists under fuel cell conditions due to rapid redistribution of ions in the Nafion via the liquid phase.

Sodium arsenite delays the differentiation of C2C12 mouse myoblast cells and alters methylation patterns on the transcription factor myogenin								TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY				250	2			154	161		10.1016/j.taap.2010.10.006			JAN 15 2011	2011	Epidemiological studies have correlated arsenic exposure with cancer, skin diseases, and adverse developmental outcomes such as spontaneous abortions, neonatal mortality, low birth weight, and delays in the use of musculature. The current study used C2C12 mouse myoblast cells to examine whether low concentrations of arsenic could alter their differentiation into myotubes, indicating that arsenic can act as a developmental toxicant. Myoblast cells were exposed to 20 nM sodium arsenite, allowed to differentiate into myotubes, and expression of the muscle-specific transcription factor myogenin, along with the expression of tropomyosin, suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (Socs3), prostaglandin 12 synthesis (Ptgis), and myocyte enhancer 2 (Mef2), was investigated using QPCR and immunofluorescence. Exposing C2C12 cells to 20 nM sodium arsenite delayed the differentiation process, as evidenced by a significant reduction in the number of multinucleated myotubes, a decrease in myogenin mRNA expression, and a decrease in the total number of nuclei expressing myogenin protein. The expression of mRNA involved in myotube formation, such as Ptgis and Mef2 mRNA, was also significantly reduced by 1.6-fold and 4-fold during differentiation. This was confirmed by immunofluorescence for Mef2, which showed a 2.6-fold reduction in nuclear translocation. Changes in methylation patterns in the promoter region of myogenin (-473 to +90) were examined by methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite genomic sequencing. Hypermethylated CpGs were found at 236 and 126 bp, whereas hypomethylated CpGs were found at 207 bp in arsenic-exposed cells. This study indicates that 20 nM sodium arsenite can alter myoblast differentiation by reducing the expression of the transcription factors myogenin and Mef2c, which is likely due to changes in promoter methylation patterns. The delay in muscle differentiation may lead to developmental abnormalities. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.									15	0	0	15	0	15			0041-008X	1096-0333		WOS:000286128600008	20965206

In the present study, poly(ethylene glycol)-conjugated (PEGylated) multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were prepared and explored as drug carrier to overcome multidrug resistance. The prepared PEGylated MWCNTs penetrated into mammalian cells without damage plasma membrane, and its accumulation did not affect cell proliferation and cell cycle distribution. More importantly, PEGylated MWCNTs accumulated in the multidrug-resistant cancer cells as efficient as in the sensitive cancer cells. Intracellular translocation of PEGylated MWCNTs was visualized in both multidrug-resistant HepG2-DR cells and sensitive HepG2 cells, as judged by both fluorescent and transmission electron microscopy. PEGylated MWCNTs targeted cancer cells efficiently and multidrug-resistant cells failed to remove the intracellular MWCNTs. However, if used in combination with drugs without conjugation, PEGylated MWCNTs prompted drug efflux in MDR cells by stimulating the ATPase activity of P-glycoprotein. This study suggests that PEGylated MWCNTs can be developed as an efficient drug carrier to conjugate drugs for overcoming multidrug resistance in cancer chemotherapy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The palladium atom in the complex 2a lies on a crystallographic mirror plane and can be described as having a square-planar coordination environment with the carbene atoms of the benzimidazole rings of the ligand occupying two coordination sites in cis positions. Two further coordination sites are occupied by chloride ligands. The benzimidazole rings are connected to each other by an ortho-xylyl bridge. The catalytic activity of these palladium complexes has been tested in the coupling reactions of various N-containing substrates with bromobenzene. A preliminary catalytic study shows that the bis(NHC)-Pd complexes are highly active in the Buchwald-Hartwig amination reaction. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Controlling the m-Poly(phenylene ethynylene) Helical Cavity Environment: Hydrogen Bond Stabilized Helical Structures								MACROMOLECULES				44	1			60	67		10.1021/ma101514c			JAN 11 2011	2011	Replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations using explicit solvents were used to study the folding behaviors of a group of m-poly(phenylene ethynylene)s (mPPEs), which are being actively investigated for a variety of biological and catalysis applications. The mPPEs considered in this study have different endohelix functional groups, which in the helical conformation of the polymer are localized within the helical cavity. The results showed that, for mPPEs with ester functional groups arranged on the exohelix of the helical polymer, altering the endohelix functional groups did not significantly affect folding behaviors in acetonitrile. This result is consistent with experimental data and indicates that the properties of the helical cavity may be tailored for certain applications without destabilizing the helix conformation, so long as the exohelix functional groups are esters. We also present simulation results for a set of mPPEs with endohelix functional groups that enhance the stability of the helical conformation via the formation of intra- and interturn hydrogen bonds (HBs). If mPPE folding is viewed as a nucleation/growth process, intraturn HB interactions facilitate both nucleation events and growth, while interturn HBs and pi-stacking interactions affect only the growth process. These mPPEs, which lack exohelix functional groups, were shown to fold into stable helical secondary structures in acetonitrile, methanol, and even chloroform, although chlorinated solvents have previously been known to denature mPPE helical structures. Our results predict that this stabilization occurs to the extent that a variety of exohelix functional groups can be incorporated into mPPE backbones, while maintaining a stable helical secondary structure, including many functional groups that are known to destabilize the helix in non-hydrogen-bonded mPPEs.									6	0	0	1	0	6			0024-9297			WOS:000285706500009

Olfactory bulbectomy impairs the feeding response to 2-deoxy-D-glucose in rats								BRAIN RESEARCH				1367				207	212		10.1016/j.brainres.2010.10.040			JAN 7 2011	2011	An early study reported that, unlike sham-operated rats, rats made anosmic by olfactory bulbectomy (OBX) failed to compensate for the dilution of their diet with nonnutritive bulk by increasing their food intake. In the present study, the effects of a glucoprivic challenge, intraperitoneal-administered 350 mg/kg 2-deoxy-o-glucose (2-DG), on food intake were measured in OBX and sham-operated female rats. Sham-operated rats significantly increased their food intake, but in two separate experiments OBX rats displayed no increase in food intake during the first 2 h following administration. Blood glucose levels were nearly identical in both groups. Body weights and daily food intakes of OBX rats did not differ from the sham-operated controls throughout the studies. Bulbectomized rats also displayed a normal drinking response after an intraperitoneal injection of 1 M hypertonic saline. Hypothalamic nuclei and the neural pathways mediating taste have been implicated in the feeding response to 2-DG. The present results suggest that olfactory input and olfactory neural pathways also mediate, at least in part, the feeding response to a glucoprivic challenge induced by intraperitoneal injection of 2-DG.

R			Biological Sciences, Clemson University						Fundulus exposed to arsenic as embryos								European Nucleotide Archive														2015-06-16	2011	The present study used microarray expression profiling to determine the effects of embryonic arsenic exposure. Fertilized killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus) eggs were exposed to 0, 5, 15, or 25ppm arsenic as sodium arsenite. To examine differentially expressed genes, the microarrays were probed using RNA obtained from the control and 25ppm-exposed killifish just after hatching. No differences were noted in survival or hatching success between any of the groups. After analysis, a set of 332 genes was found to accurately distinguish between the control and 25ppm exposure groups. Expression of several of the genes (CDBP1, Arts1, FetB, and Fbp7) was quantified by qPCR in the lower exposure groups and at earlier time points to examine temporal and dose-responsive expression patterns. These results will enable us to better understand how arsenic impacts development. Overall design: Killifish eggs were fertilized, divided into petri dishes containing 40 eggs (n=10 replicate petri dishes), and cultured until hatch in 0 or 25 ppm arsenic as sodium arsenite. Four to five hatchlings within each petri dish were pooled to obtain RNA. A total of 20 arrays were probed, 10 with RNA from control fish and 10 with RNA from the arsenic-exposed fish.									0	0	0	0	0	0						DRCI:DATA2015253007224538

Psyche (Cambridge)				2011				1	6				Article ID 940280	2011	2011	We describe a rearing protocol that allowed us to raise the threatened butterfly, Argynnis diana (Nymphalidae), while bypassing the first instar overwintering diapause. We compared the survival of offspring reared under this protocol from field-collected A. diana females from North Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee. Larvae were reared in the lab on three phylogenetically distinct species of Southern Appalachian violets (Viola sororia, V. pubescens, and V. pedata). We assessed larval survival in A. diana to the last instar, pupation, and adulthood. Males reared in captivity emerged significantly earlier than females. An ANOVA revealed no evidence of host plant preference by A. diana toward three native violet species. We suggest that restoration of A. diana habitat which promotes a wide array of larval and adult host plants, is urgently needed to conserve this imperiled species into the future.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0033-2615; 1687-7438			ZOOREC:ZOOR14801005113

This strand of research emerged from the realization that for most countries economic development is a highly unstable process; over a course of a few decades, a typical country enjoys periods of rapid growth as well episodes of stagnation and economic decline. This approach highlights the complex nature of growth and implies that studying transitions between periods of fast growth, stagnation, and collapse is essential for understanding the process of long run growth. We document recent efforts to characterize and study such growth transitions. We also update and extend some of our earlier research. Specifically, we use historical data from Maddison to confirm a link between political institutions and propensity to experience large swings in growth. We also study the role of institutions and macroeconomic policies, such as inflation, openness to trade, size of government, and real exchange rate overvaluation, in the context of growth transitions. We find surprisingly complex effects of some policies. For example, trade makes fast growth more likely but also increases the frequency of crises. The size of government reduces the likelihood of fast miracle-like growth while at the same time limiting the risk of stagnation. Moreover, these effects are nonlinear and dependent on the quality of institutions. We conclude by highlighting potentially promising areas for future research.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1574-8715		978-1-78052-396-5	WOS:000304324200013

This rich example presents fashion with a specific garment and wearers, yet mediating work in multiple directions, exemplifying fashion's ambivalence and flexibility. I will describe three positions taken, articulated around gender, and their relations to dominant culture: (1) sneakers are feminine and rejected in opposition to dominant culture; (2) sneakers are masculine and embraced in assimilation into dominant culture; and (3) sneakers are masculine and embraced in opposition to dominant culture. Beginning from a position of ambivalence (like fashion itself), I will elaborate historical and cultural contexts, showing a particular garment, among a particular group, put to varied ends. However, multiplicity is not necessarily progressive. While there are counter-hegemonic aspects to these sneaker positions-resisting stereotypes, embracing difference, denaturalizing sex, gender, and sexuality constructions-other aspects preserve the status quo. While admiring the creativity evidenced, I ultimately question positions untaken, such as embracing femininity.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1479-1420			WOS:000307978700003

This problem admits a straightforward path formulation, for which a branch-and-price problem where, for each node of the branch-and-bound tree, column generation is used to obtain a lower bound.					5th International Network Optimization Conference (INOC)5th International Network Optimization Conference (INOC)	JUN 13-16, 2011JUN 13-16, 2011		Univ Hamburg, Hamburg, GERMANYUniv Hamburg, Hamburg, GERMANY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0302-9743		978-3-642-21527-8	WOS:000306643300048

A RAG-based AST can be used as the in-memory model providing semantic information for software language tools such as compilers, refactoring tools, and meta-modeling tools. RAG performance is based on dynamic attribute evaluation with caching. Caching all attributes gives optimal performance in the sense that each attribute is evaluated at most once. However, performance can be further improved by a selective caching strategy, avoiding caching overhead where it does not pay off. In this paper we present a profiling-based technique for automatically finding a good cache configuration. The technique has been evaluated on a generated Java compiler, compiling programs from the Jacks test suite and the DaCapo benchmark suite.					3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering	OCT 12-13, 2010OCT 12-13, 2010	Assoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci ResAssoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci Res	Eindhoven, NETHERLANDSEindhoven, NETHERLANDS	1	0	0	0	0	1			0302-9743		978-3-642-19439-9	WOS:000296827000002

Therefore, we propose the application of reference attribute grammars (RAGs) to alleviate the lack of support for formal semantics specification in metamodelling. We contribute the conceptual foundations to integrate metamodelling languages and RAGs, and present JastEMF - a tool for the specification of EMF metamodel semantics using last Add RAGs. The presented approach is exemplified by an integrated metamodelling example. Its advantages, disadvantages and limitations are discussed and related to metamodelling, attribute grammars (AGs) and other approaches for metamodel semantics.					3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering	OCT 12-13, 2010OCT 12-13, 2010	Assoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci ResAssoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci Res	Eindhoven, NETHERLANDSEindhoven, NETHERLANDS	3	0	0	0	0	3			0302-9743		978-3-642-19439-9	WOS:000296827000003

GLL parsers are recursive descent-like, in that the structure of the parser's code closely mirrors the grammar rules, and so grammars (and their parsers) may be debugged by tracing the running parser in a debugger. While GLL recognisers are straightforward to describe, full GLL parsers present technical traps and challenges for the unwary. In particular, naive implementations based closely on the theoretical description of GLL can result in data structures that are not practical for grammars for real programming language grammars such as ANSI-C. We develop an equivalent formulation of the algorithm as a high-level set-theoretic model supported by table-based indices, in order to then explore a set of alternative implementations which trade space for time in ways which preserve the cubic bound.					3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering	OCT 12-13, 2010OCT 12-13, 2010	Assoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci ResAssoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci Res	Eindhoven, NETHERLANDSEindhoven, NETHERLANDS	6	0	0	0	0	6			0302-9743		978-3-642-19439-9	WOS:000296827000004

Metamodels define their constructs and thereby reflect the expectations of the language developers about the use of the language. In practice, language users often do not use the constructs provided by a metamodel as expected by language developers. In this paper, we advocate that insights about how constructs are used can offer language developers useful information for improving the metamodel. We define a set of usage and improvement patterns to characterize the use of the metamodel by the built models. We present our experience with the analysis of the usage of seven metamodels (EMF, GMF, UNICASE) and a large corpus of models. Our empirical investigation shows that we identify mismatches between the expected and actual use of a language that are useful for metamodel improvements.					3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering	OCT 12-13, 2010OCT 12-13, 2010	Assoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci ResAssoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci Res	Eindhoven, NETHERLANDSEindhoven, NETHERLANDS	1	0	0	0	0	1			0302-9743		978-3-642-19439-9	WOS:000296827000005

In Software Engineering endeavors such capabilities are direly needed, for ease of implementation, maintenance, and software analysis.Conversely, software engineering has collected decades of experience in engineering large application frameworks containing both inheritance and aggregation. This experience could be of great use when, for example, thinking about the development of ontologies.These examples-and many others-seem to suggest that researchers from both fields should have a field clay collaborating: On the surface this looks like a match made in heaven. But is that the case?This talk will explore the opportunities for cross-fertilization of the two research fields by presenting a set of concrete examples. In addition to the opportunities it; will also try to identify cases of fools gold (pyrite), where the differences in method, tradition, or semantics between the two research fields may lead to a wild goose chase.					3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering	OCT 12-13, 2010OCT 12-13, 2010	Assoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci ResAssoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci Res	Eindhoven, NETHERLANDSEindhoven, NETHERLANDS	0	0	0	0	0	0			0302-9743		978-3-642-19439-9	WOS:000296827000012

To ease the construction of adaptable applications that are smarter with respect to their execution environment, the context-oriented programming paradigm has emerged. However, up until now there has been no proof that this emerging paradigm can be implemented and used effectively on mobile devices, probably the kind of platform which is most subject to dynamically changing contexts. In this paper we study how to effectively realise core context-oriented abstractions on top of Objective-C, a mainstream language for mobile device programming. The result is Subjective-C, a language which goes beyond existing context-oriented languages by providing a rich encoding of context interdependencies. Our initial validation cases and efficiency benchmarks make us confident that context-oriented programming can become mainstream in mobile application development.					3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering	OCT 12-13, 2010OCT 12-13, 2010	Assoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci ResAssoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci Res	Eindhoven, NETHERLANDSEindhoven, NETHERLANDS	5	0	0	0	0	5			0302-9743		978-3-642-19439-9	WOS:000296827000015

It does this by explicitly distinguishing between linguistic and ontological forms of classification and by allowing the influence of classifiers to extend over more than one level of instantiation. Multi-level modeling is consequently starting to receive attention from a growing number of research groups. However, there has never been a concrete definition of a language designed from the ground-up for the specific purpose of representing multi-level models. Some authors have informally defined the "look and feel" of such a language, but to date there has been no systematic or fully elaborated definition of its concrete syntax. In this paper we address this problem by introducing the key elements of a language, known as the Level-Agnostic Modeling Language (LML) designed to support multi-level modeling.					3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering	OCT 12-13, 2010OCT 12-13, 2010	Assoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci ResAssoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci Res	Eindhoven, NETHERLANDSEindhoven, NETHERLANDS	4	0	0	0	0	4			0302-9743		978-3-642-19439-9	WOS:000296827000016

Given a model and a DMM specification, a transition system can be computed which represents the semantics of that model. It; allows for the investigation of the model's behavior, e.g. for the sake of understanding the model's semantics or to verify that certain requirements are fulfilled. However, due to a number of reasons such as tooling and the size of the resulting transition systems, the manual inspection of the resulting transition system is cumbersome.One solution would be a visualization of the model's behavior using animated concrete syntax. In this paper, we show how we have enhanced DMM such that visual execution and debugging can be added to a. language in a simple manner.					3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering	OCT 12-13, 2010OCT 12-13, 2010	Assoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci ResAssoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci Res	Eindhoven, NETHERLANDSEindhoven, NETHERLANDS	1	0	0	0	0	1			0302-9743		978-3-642-19439-9	WOS:000296827000024

At the same time, TEX is also an unusual programming language with a quite powerful macro system. Despite the wide range of TEX users (especially in the scientific community), and despite a widely perceived considerable level of "pain" in using TEX, there is almost no research on TEX. This paper is an attempt to change that.To this end, we present Featherweight TEX, a formal model of TEX which we hope can play a similar role for TEX as Featherweight Java did for Java. The main technical problem which we study in terms of Featherweight TEX is the parsing problem. As for other dynamic languages performing syntactic analysis at runtime, the concept of "static" parsing and its correctness is unclear in TEX and shall be clarified in this paper. Moreover, it is the case that parsing TEX is impossible in general, but we present evidence that parsers for practical subsets exists.We furthermore outline three immediate applications of our formalization of TEX and its parsing: a. macro debugger, an analysis that detects syntactic inconsistencies, and a test framework for TEX parsers.					3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering	OCT 12-13, 2010OCT 12-13, 2010	Assoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci ResAssoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci Res	Eindhoven, NETHERLANDSEindhoven, NETHERLANDS	0	0	0	0	0	0			0302-9743		978-3-642-19439-9	WOS:000296827000026

A vehicle model was developed and validated with track test data and subsequently coupled to an optimised driver model. Multiple vehicle configurations were simulated to identify relationships between four commonly used open-loop handling performance metrics and some quadratic measures of closed-loop performance indicative of driver mental and physical workload and overall path tracking ability. Qualitative statements are made regarding the relationships between some of the open-loop handling metrics and the objective closed-loop performance measures.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0143-3369			WOS:000296537300002

The variability of these extreme objects requires continuous all-sky coverage, while detailed study demands an improvement in sensitivity over previous technologies by at least an order of magnitude.The DUAL payload is composed of an All-Sky Compton Imager (ASCI), and two optical modules, the Laue-Lens Optic (LLO) and the Coded-Mask Optic (CMO). The ASCI serves dual roles simultaneously, both as an optimal focal-plane sensor for deep observations with the optical modules and as a sensitive true all-sky telescope in its own right for all-sky surveys and monitoring. While the optical modules are located on the main satellite, the All-Sky Compton Imager is situated on a deployable structure at a distance of 30 m from the satellite. This configuration not only permits to maintain the less massive payload at the focal distance, it also greatly reduces the spacecraft-induced detector background, and, above all it provides ASCI with a continuous all-sky exposure.

Twenty-five participants aged 65 or older performed a given shopping task with a human agent playing the role of a conversational agent. The activity computer screens were video-recorded and the participant-agent conversations were audio-recorded. Through navigation path analysis as well as content analysis of the conversations, three major issues hindering older users' Internet interaction are identified: (1) a lack of prior computer knowledge, (2) a failure to locate information or buttons, and (3) confusions related to meanings of information. The navigation path analysis also suggests potential ways conversational agents may assist older users to optimize their search strategies. Implications and suggestions for future studies are discussed.

A probing algorithm is a bound-tightening procedure that explores the consequences of restricting a variable to a subinterval with the goal of tightening its bounds. We propose a variant of probing where exploration is based on iteratively applying a truncated Branch-and-Bound algorithm. As this approach is computationally expensive, we use a Support-Vector-Machine classifier to infer whether or not the probing algorithm should be used. Computational experiments demonstrate that the use of this classifier saves a substantial amount of CPU time at the cost of a marginally weaker bound tightening.					8th International Conference on Integration of AI and OR Techniques in Constraint Programming for Combinatorial Optimization Problems (CPAIOR)8th International Conference on Integration of AI and OR Techniques in Constraint Programming for Combinatorial Optimization Problems (CPAIOR)	MAY 23-27, 2011MAY 23-27, 2011	DFG Res Ctr Matheon; Zuse Inst Berlin; Assoc Constraint Programming; SAS; IBM; AIMMS; Gurobi Optimizat; FICO; Inst Computat Sustainabil; GAMS; IVU Traffic Technol AG; MOSEK Optimizat; Natl ICT Australia; Jeppesen; ABB Grp; Atesio GmbH; ProCom GmbH; AMPL; OGEDFG Res Ctr Matheon; Zuse Inst Berlin; Assoc Constraint Programming; SAS; IBM; AIMMS; Gurobi Optimizat; FICO; Inst Computat Sustainabil; GAMS; IVU Traffic Technol AG; MOSEK Optimizat; Natl ICT Australia; Jeppesen; ABB Grp; Atesio GmbH; ProCom GmbH; AMPL; OGE	Berlin, GERMANYBerlin, GERMANY	1	0	0	0	0	1			0302-9743		978-3-642-21311-3	WOS:000306067300015

This project piloted the concept of using Web-based videoconferencing to allow university faculty to facilitate research in a precollege setting. This technology removed the more than 200 miles distance between the partners as an impediment to the participation of district teachers and students in Clemson University programs. To prepare teachers for the research, an online course was developed and disseminated from Clemson University via Macromedia Breeze. Teachers and administrators from Florence District Three met with Clemson University faculty through videoconferencing and bulletin board technology. District personnel chose the theme, "The Rise and Fall of Tobacco in the Lake City Market Area." The school district personnel also gained proficiency in digital technology skills (e.g. Adobe Photoshop Elements, Adobe Premier Elements, Movie Maker) that they and their students used to collect information and create a final DVD.									0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-60960-624-4	WOS:000303202600038

Response Sensitivity of Highway Bridges to Randomly Oriented Multi-Component Earthquake Excitation								JOURNAL OF EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING				15	6			850	876		10.1080/13632469.2010.551706			2011	2011	In two-dimensional and single axis three-dimensional finite element analyses, the ground motion incidence angle can play a significant role in structural response. The effect of incidence angle for three-dimensional excitation and response is investigated in this paper for response of highway bridges. Single-degree-of-freedom elastic and inelastic mean spectra were computed from various orientation techniques and found indistinguishable for combinations of orthogonal horizontal components. Probabilistic seismic demand models were generated for the nonlinear response of five different bridge models. The negligible effect of incidence angle on mean ensemble response was confirmed with a stochastic representation of the ground motions.									8	1	0	0	0	9			1363-2469			WOS:000304702900003

The purpose of this chapter is to focus on the educational opportunities for applying social media in the classroom and this is achieved through an application of Bloom's Taxonomy. A brief description of Bloom's Taxonomy (Bloom, B.S. Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: The Classification of Educational Goals. Susan Fauer Company, Inc., 1956) and a description of its components: remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating is given. It is argued that each of Bloom's components can be highlighted using different social media tools. Finally, a variety of case studies and further ideas demonstrate the effective deployment of social media in the classroom.									11	0	0	0	0	11					978-3-642-20391-6	WOS:000303840000001

The stability control system determines the necessary corrective yaw moment and achieves correction of oversteer or understeer via a controlled differential actuation of the wheel-end hydraulic pump/motors. During aggressive handling manoeuvres, the motors can be operated as pumps for re-generating the vehicle's kinetic energy into on-board hydraulic accumulators. This system has the distinct benefit of avoiding excessive activation of the friction brakes as is common in current stability control technology.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1744-232X			WOS:000295392400007

Within-stand variation in understorey vegetation affects fire behaviour in longleaf pine xeric sandhills								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE				20	7			866	875		10.1071/WF10087			2011	2011	The frequent fires typical of the longleaf pine ecosystem in the south-eastern USA are carried by live understorey vegetation and pine litter. Mature longleaf pine stands in the xeric sandhills region have a variable understorey vegetation layer, creating several fuel complexes at the within-stand scale (20 m(2)). We identified three fuel complexes found in frequently burned stands on the Carolina Sandhills National Wildlife Refuge, and used prescribed fire to test whether distinct sets of fire conditions were associated with each fuel complex. Study plots were dominated by either turkey oak or wiregrass in the understorey, or lacked understorey vegetation and contained only longleaf pine litter. Turkey oak-dominated plots had the highest fuel loads, and during burns they had higher total net heat flux than wiregrass- or longleaf pine litter-dominated plots, and longer burn durations than wiregrass-dominated plots. Across all plots, the quantity of litter fragments had the greatest effect on fire temperature and duration of burn. These results show that the patchy understorey vegetation within longleaf pine stands will create heterogeneous fires, and areas dominated by turkey oak may have increased fire intensity and soil heating compared with the other two fuel complexes.									7	0	0	7	0	7			1049-8001			WOS:000296200700006

Due to biological constraints, the sensors may only be sparsely distributed and intermittently monitored. This paper proposes a nonbiological experimental platform, based on hydrogel and dye diffusion, for studying the problem of concentration field estimation using point sensors. A reduced order model for the diffusion system is derived using Karhunen-Loeve-Galerkin method and a discrete time Kalman filter is used to estimate the concentration field. The estimator is then applied to experimental data consisting of subsampled images from a diffusion process. Performance is evaluated by comparing the state estimates to the original images. Future work will use the experimental platform to study the effects of spatial distribution and timing of sensor measurements, to examine the effects of additional dynamics such as advection and reaction, and to perform online identification of process parameters.					50th IEEE Conference of Decision and Control (CDC)/European Control Conference (ECC)50th IEEE Conference of Decision and Control (CDC)/European Control Conference (ECC)	DEC 12-15, 2011DEC 12-15, 2011	Honeywell; MathWorks; United Technol Res Ctr; HYCON2; IEEE; Contrl Syst Soc (CSS); EUCAHoneywell; MathWorks; United Technol Res Ctr; HYCON2; IEEE; Contrl Syst Soc (CSS); EUCA	Orlando, FLOrlando, FL	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-61284-801-3	WOS:000303506205029

Previous models assume all nodes use ad-hoc mode with uniform traffic without mobility. This model is developed using the fixed-point analysis, which assumes asymmetric traffic loads for AP and clients, and both types of traffic are nonsaturated. The mobility effect is also considered, which is modeled as a throughput scaling factor taking account of velocity and communication range. Numerical evaluation compared with Bianchi's model, verifies the proposed model and quantifies the difference caused by asymmetric traffic, and the throughput with mobile nodes is evaluated with the increase in velocity.					14th ACM International Conference on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Wireless and Mobile Systems (MSWiM)14th ACM International Conference on Modeling, Analysis and Simulation of Wireless and Mobile Systems (MSWiM)	OCT 31-NOV 04, 2011OCT 31-NOV 04, 2011	ACM SIGSIMACM SIGSIM	Miami, FLMiami, FL	4	0	0	0	0	4					978-1-4503-0898-4	WOS:000304070700040		
J	Palanisamy, Prashanth; Klotz, Leidy								DELIVERY PROCESS ATTRIBUTES, COMMON TO INDIA AND THE US, FOR MORE SUSTAINABLE BUILDINGS								JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING				6	4			146	157					2011	2011	India is a rapidly developing nation, so its adoption of sustainable building would have considerable social, environmental, and economic benefits. However, process attributes that contribute to successful delivery (planning, design, construction and operation) of sustainable buildings in India are largely undefined. Other projects in India would benefit from a rigorous identification of these process attributes, which is the purpose of this research. This research applies process mapping to study the delivery of Soundarya Decorator's factory building in Chennai, India; a project which achieved advanced sustainability performance with no first cost increase. From these process maps, process attributes are identified and compared to those identified in a previously published study of Toyota's South Campus facility in Torrance, California. Process attributes common to both projects include: demonstrating an early commitment to sustainability by key stakeholders; setting goals related to sustainability, not certification; continuously educating project stakeholders on sustainability; aligning sustainable features with business objectives; encouraging project team "buy-in" to sustainability goals; and investing design time to consider alternative sustainable solutions.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1552-6100			WOS:000303727800012

For long-duration Swift bursts with a detected X-ray afterglow, we achieve a 90% (35/39) detection rate of optical/NIR afterglows whenever our observations started within less than 240 min after the burst. Complementing our GROND data with Swift/XRT spectra we construct broad-band spectral energy distributions and derive rest-frame extinctions. We detect 25-40% "dark bursts", depending on the definition used. The faint optical afterglow emission of "dark bursts" is mainly due to a combination of two contributing factors: (i) moderate intrinsic extinction at moderate redshifts, and (ii) about 22% of "dark" bursts at redshift >5.

Compound concentric nozzle-based jetting has been favored due to its efficiency and precise control of the core-shell compound structure. Thus far, little is known about the underlying formation mechanism of double-layered microcapsules in compound nozzle jetting. This study aims to understand the formability of double-layered microcapsules in compound nozzle jetting by coupling a theoretical analysis with numerical simulations. A linear temporal instability analysis is used to define the perturbation growth rate and its ratio as a function of the wavenumber; and a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method is implemented to model the microcapsule formation process in order to determine the good microcapsule forming range based on the growth ratio curve. Using a pseudo-bisection method, the lower and upper bounds of the good formability range have been determined for a given materials-nozzle system. The proposed formability prediction methodology has been implemented and validated in modeling a water- poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) - air compound jetting system with satisfactory prediction results.

While most ion species used in electronic fabrication (e. g., implantation or plasma cleaning/oxidation) have charge q approximate to 1 and negligible neutralization energies, the HCIs utilized in this work are up to q=44 and carry as much as 52 keV per HCI of neutralization energy, ample to modify the chemical and electrical properties of the tunnel barriers at the impact site. Hundreds of MTJ devices have been fabricated, revealing some general characteristics of the HCI modified tunnel junctions: the electrical conductance increases linearly with the number of HCIs used; the conductance added per HCI depends on the initial tunnel barrier thickness and the barrier stoichiometry; the transport is usually tunneling (not Ohmic); and the conductance added by the HCI process can substantially increase the magneto-conductance. Recent experiments (not shown) have also revealed an enormous dependence on the charge state of the HCI used in tunnel barrier irradiation.					21st International Conference on Application of Accelerators in Research and Industry (CAARI)21st International Conference on Application of Accelerators in Research and Industry (CAARI)	AUG 08-13, 2010AUG 08-13, 2010	Univ N Texas; Sandia Natl Labs; Los Alamos Natl Lab; AccSys Technol Inc; High Voltage Engn Europa BV; Natl Electrostat Corp; TDK-Lambda AmerUniv N Texas; Sandia Natl Labs; Los Alamos Natl Lab; AccSys Technol Inc; High Voltage Engn Europa BV; Natl Electrostat Corp; TDK-Lambda Amer	Ft Worth, TXFt Worth, TX	0	0	0	0	0	0			0094-243X		978-0-7354-0891-3	WOS:000302912900022

This study applied and compared several procedures for calculating empirical confidence intervals for USDA forecasts of corn, soybean and wheat prices over the 1980/81 through 2006/07 marketing years. Alternative procedures were compared based on out-of-sample performance over 1995/96 through 2006/07. The results of this study demonstrate that kernel density, quantile distribution and best fitting parametric distribution (logistic) methods provided confidence intervals calibrated at the 80% level prior to harvest and 90% level after harvest. The kernel density-based method appears most accurate both before and after harvest with the final value falling inside the forecast interval 77% of the time before harvest and 92% after harvest, followed by quantile regression (73% and 91% before and after harvest, respectively) logistic distribution (73% and 90% before and after harvest, respectively) and histogram (66% and 84% before and after harvest, respectively). Overall, this study demonstrates that empirical approaches may be used to construct more accurate confidence intervals for USDA corn, soybean and wheat price forecasts.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0003-6846	1466-4283		WOS:000295691000008

The material handling industry utilizes mechatronics to move, track, and manipulate items in factories and distribution centers. Material handling systems are a logical choice of study, due to their use of multiple mechatronic elements. This article describes mechatronic experiments and projects in a new course. Topical coverage includes sensors, actuators, PLCs, robotics, pneumatics, hydraulics, human factors, teamwork, leadership, and project management A series of eight laboratory experiments have been created to introduce PLCs, robotics, electric circuits, and data acquisition fundamentals. In-depth case studies synthesize the technologies and interpersonal skills together to create a flexible material handling system. The most significant student outcome is the successful completion of a course project that required individuals to apply mechatronics concepts and technology in a multi-disciplinary team setting to solve industrial material handling tasks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0020-7209			WOS:000294796700008

The simulations were performed using a much longer simulation system than our previous simulations in order to investigate the full nonlinear stage of the Weibel instability and its particle acceleration mechanism. Cold jet electrons are thermalized and ambient electrons are accelerated in the resulting shocks. Acceleration of ambient electrons leads to a maximum ambient electron density three times larger than the original value as predicted by hydrodynamic shock compression. In the jet (reverse) shock behind the bow (forward) shock the strongest electromagnetic fields are generated. These fields may lead to time dependent afterglow emission. In order to calculate radiation from first principles that goes beyond the standard synchrotron model used in astrophysical objects we have used PIC simulations. Initially we calculated radiation from electrons propagating in a uniform parallel magnetic field to verify the technique. We then used the technique to calculate emission from electrons in a small simulation system. From these simulations we obtained spectra which are consistent with those generated from electrons propagating in turbulent magnetic fields with red noise. This turbulent magnetic field is similar to the magnetic field generated at an early nonlinear stage of the Weibel instability. A fully developed shock within a larger simulation system may generate a jitter/synchrotron spectrum.

Hidden Markov models (HMMs) have used timing data to extract passwords from cryptographically protected communications tunnels. We extend that work to show how HMM models of protocols can be extracted directly from observations of protocol timing artifacts with no a priori knowledge. Since our approach uses symbolic reasoning, an important question is how to best translate continuous data observations to symbolic data. This translation is problematic when observation variance makes continuous to symbolic translation unreliable. We examine this problem and show that the HMMs we infer compensate automatically for significant observation jitter and symbol misclassification. Experimental verification is presented.					7th IEEE International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)7th IEEE International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference (IWCMC)	JUL 04-08, 2011JUL 04-08, 2011	IEEE; IEEE Turkey sect; HuaweiIEEE; IEEE Turkey sect; Huawei	Istanbul, TURKEYIstanbul, TURKEY	0	0	0	0	0	0			2376-6492		978-1-4244-9537-5	WOS:000300570200218

APPLICATION OF BARYCENTER REFINED MESHES IN LINEAR ELASTICITY AND INCOMPRESSIBLE FLUID DYNAMICS								ELECTRONIC TRANSACTIONS ON NUMERICAL ANALYSIS				38				258	274					2011	2011	The paper demonstrates that enhanced stability properties of some finite element methods on barycenter refined meshes enables efficient numerical treatment of problems involving incompressible or nearly incompressible media. One example is the linear elasticity problem in a pure displacement formulation, where a lower order finite element method is studied which is optimal order accurate and robust with respect to the Poisson ratio parameter. Another example is a penalty method for incompressible viscous flows. In this case, we show that barycenter refined meshes prompt a "first penalize, then discretize" approach, avoiding locking phenomena, and leading to a method with optimal convergence rates independent of the penalty parameter, and resulting in discrete systems with advantageous algebraic properties.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1068-9613			WOS:000299643200014

This study expands on this research by examining how mathematics identity impacts the choice of engineering careers for male and female students. Our framework encompasses interest, recognition, performance, and competence as central factors that contribute to the development of mathematics identity. The data used in this study were drawn from the Factors Influencing College Success in Mathematics (FICS-Math) project; the survey included questions on students' demographics, mathematics background/experiences, interest in mathematics, and career aspirations.Results indicate that factors of mathematics interest, mathematics competence and performance, and mathematics recognition are significant predictors of the choice of an engineering career, even after controlling for SAT/ACT math scores and demographics such as parental education. Moreover, the interaction between mathematics recognition and gender is also significant with the estimate indicating that females who are recognized in mathematics are more likely to choose engineering careers.

IEEE					Work In Progress - Robust Engineering Problems for the Study of Problem Solving Strategies								2011 FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE (FIE)		Frontiers in Education Conference												2011	2011	Our research group is examining how first year engineering students develop problem-solving skills. It is important to select and design problems such that they promote self-efficacy and build effective problem solving skills. However, it is a challenge for engineering educators to determine the appropriate difficulty or rigor of assignments or assessments that will accomplish this, especially in introductory courses in which students have a range of academic preparedness. We are reporting here on methodologies developed for studying characteristics of engineering problems, perceived difficulty of the problems from students' perspective, and different problem solving strategies that first year engineering students typically use.					41st Annual Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)41st Annual Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)	OCT 12-15, 2011OCT 12-15, 2011	IEEE Educ Soc; IEEE Comp Soc; Amer Soc Engn Educ (ASEE), Educl Res Methods (ERM); Inst Elect & Elect Engineers (IEEE); S Dakota Sch Mines & TechnolIEEE Educ Soc; IEEE Comp Soc; Amer Soc Engn Educ (ASEE), Educl Res Methods (ERM); Inst Elect & Elect Engineers (IEEE); S Dakota Sch Mines & Technol	Rapid City, SDRapid City, SD	0	0	0	0	0	0			0190-5848		978-1-61284-469-5	WOS:000300879800280

IEEE					Developing a Survey Instrument to Characterize Social Capital Resources Impacting Undergraduates' Decisions to Enter and Persist in Engineering								2011 FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE (FIE)		Frontiers in Education Conference												2011	2011	This paper describes the theoretical basis, development, and initial results of a quantitative survey instrument that measures the engineering-related social capital resources of undergraduate engineering students. Despite significant efforts over the last few decades to increase participation of under-represented groups in engineering within the United States, progress has been disturbingly slow. Further research in this domain is needed to realize the significant advancements that are necessary for diversifying undergraduate engineering enrollment. The long-term purpose of this research is to develop a conceptual model based on Social Capital Theory to provide a deeper understanding and explanation of undergraduates' academic and career choices related to engineering, of which developing the survey instrument is the first step. Our "Name and Resource Generator" instrument has been administered to 890 students at three institutions within the United States. Supporting literature and initial results indicate that under-represented students in engineering may utilize different mechanisms for developing and activating engineering-related social capital compared to other engineering undergraduates, and that an approach utilizing social capital theory shows promise as a model with which to improve the diversity of the engineering field.					41st Annual Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)41st Annual Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)	OCT 12-15, 2011OCT 12-15, 2011	IEEE Educ Soc; IEEE Comp Soc; Amer Soc Engn Educ (ASEE), Educl Res Methods (ERM); Inst Elect & Elect Engineers (IEEE); S Dakota Sch Mines & TechnolIEEE Educ Soc; IEEE Comp Soc; Amer Soc Engn Educ (ASEE), Educl Res Methods (ERM); Inst Elect & Elect Engineers (IEEE); S Dakota Sch Mines & Technol	Rapid City, SDRapid City, SD	0	0	0	0	0	0			0190-5848		978-1-61284-469-5	WOS:000300879800026

IEEE					Implications of Black Greek Letter Membership on the Development of the Engineer of 2020								2011 FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE (FIE)		Frontiers in Education Conference												2011	2011	Higher education and student affairs literature have detailed the impact of Black Greek Organizations (BGOs) on African American students' educational experiences. However, our work is the first examination of BGO membership in terms of impact on engineering students' educational experiences, and specifically skills deemed valuable by the National Academy of Engineering's (NAE) The Engineer of 2020: Visions of Engineering in the New Century. In our earlier study, results pointed to the many advantages of African American student participation in BGOs on their engineering educational experiences. Further, the data suggested that BGO membership has the potential to provide unique contributions to African American engineering students' persistence, academic achievement, and career paths. This paper builds on our previous work by examining how students' BGO experiences influence the development of specific skills described by the Engineer of 2020. Results of this qualitative study point to the potential advantages of African American engineering students participating in BGOs, particularly equipping them to succeed in the engineering workforce by instilling qualities of The Engineer of 2020. The significance of the work is also highlighted by the focus on BGOs, which have been a staple of the AfricanAmerican culture and educational community for over 100 years.					41st Annual Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)41st Annual Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)	OCT 12-15, 2011OCT 12-15, 2011	IEEE Educ Soc; IEEE Comp Soc; Amer Soc Engn Educ (ASEE), Educl Res Methods (ERM); Inst Elect & Elect Engineers (IEEE); S Dakota Sch Mines & TechnolIEEE Educ Soc; IEEE Comp Soc; Amer Soc Engn Educ (ASEE), Educl Res Methods (ERM); Inst Elect & Elect Engineers (IEEE); S Dakota Sch Mines & Technol	Rapid City, SDRapid City, SD	0	0	0	0	0	0			0190-5848		978-1-61284-469-5	WOS:000300879800289

IEEE					Adaptive Incremental-Redundancy Transmission for Tactical Packet Radio Systems								2011 - MILCOM 2011 MILITARY COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE								224	229					2011	2011	A low-complexity protocol for the adaptation of incremental-redundancy transmission is described and evaluated for use in tactical packet radio systems that must communicate over channels with fading and other time-varying propagation losses. The protocol responds to variations in channel attenuation by adjusting the number of binary code symbols that are punctured in the first transmission for a packet and saved for subsequent transmissions if they are needed. The protocol relies on simple statistics from the receiver to provide the necessary control information for adapting the amount of puncturing or the rate of the code that is employed from one packet to the next. No channel measurements, parameter estimates, pilot symbols, or training are needed. The protocol's throughput performance is evaluated for dynamic channels that are modeled by finite-state Markov chains. Performance benchmarks are obtained from hypothetical ideal protocols that are given perfect channel-state information and are told all the parameters of the channel model. We demonstrate that the new adaptive protocol performs nearly as well as the hypothetical ideal protocols even though the adaptive protocol is given no channel-state information and no information about the channel model or its parameters.

Markov chain models are very valuable tools in the analysis and simulation of protocols, systems, and networks. The Nakagami fading parameter m and the correlation parameter for the fade levels experienced by consecutive symbols or packets can be adjusted to match anticipated propagation conditions or experimental data. These parameters can also be varied to test the sensitivity of a protocol or system to changes in the characteristics of the fading on a tactical communications link. Applications to the evaluation of adaptive transmission protocols are described.

Non-coherent diversity combining of the outputs from a corresponding pair of preamble matched filters is considered in conjunction with threshold-based acquisition using both fixed and adaptive acquisition thresholds. The effect of the intermediate-frequency filter and the automatic gain control subsystem on the acquisition performance is addressed, and the performance is evaluated in a slow fading channel. The effect of fixed and adaptive acquisition thresholds on the link outage probability is compared for the dual antenna system, and both are compared with the outage probability in a single antenna system.

The lower resolution provides higher computational throughput at the cost of poorer performance in many applications. We investigate the effect of the resolution of saturating, fixed-point arithmetic on the performance of the turbo-decoding message-passing algorithm with quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check codes. We consider limits on the magnitude of extrinsic updates as a means to mitigate the effect of posterior-value saturation on the decoder's performance. We show that a fixed limit on updates only partially overcomes the greater effect of saturation in 8-bit operations, whereas a limit that depends on the degree of the variable node results in performance almost as good as what is possible with 16-bit operations.

Emphasis of the paper is placed on establishing a relationship between the probability of liquefaction/cyclic softening and the safety factor determined with a recently developed deterministic CPTu-based model. The significance of the developed probabilistic model lies in the fact that the model is applicable to both sand-like and clay-like soils, which is ideal as a stand-alone tool for evaluating liquefaction and cyclic softening potential. Furthermore, the developed model is shown to hold advantages over existing CPT-based methods. Examples for applying the proposed CPTu-based models to characterize the liquefaction/cyclic softening potential at a given site are provided.					12th East Asia-Pacific Conference on Structural Engineering and Construction (EASEC)12th East Asia-Pacific Conference on Structural Engineering and Construction (EASEC)	JAN 26-28, 2011JAN 26-28, 2011		Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINAHong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0			1877-7058		*****************	WOS:000300368402089

The Cloud has emerged as the next big trend. The burst of platform and projects providing Cloud resources and interfaces at the very same time that Grid projects are entering a production phase in their life cycle has however raised the question of the best approach to handling distributed resources. Especially, are Cloud resources scaling at the levels shown by Grids? Are they performing at the same level? What is their overhead on the IT teams and infrastructure? Rather than seeing the two as orthogonal, the STAR experiment has viewed them as complimentary and has studied merging the best of the two worlds with Grid middleware providing the aggregation of both Cloud and traditional resources. Since its first use of Cloud resources on Amazon EC2 in 2008/2009 using a Nimbus/EC2 interface, the STAR software team has tested and experimented with many novel approaches: from a traditional, native EC2 approach to the Virtual Organization Cluster (VOC) at Clemson University and Condor/VM on the GLOW resources at the University of Wisconsin. The STAR team is also planning to run as part of the DOE/Magellan project. In this paper, we will present an overview of our findings from using truly opportunistic resources and scaling-out two orders of magnitude in both tests and practical usage.

The bioprinter studied here is based on the thermal inkjet HP26A cartridge, but any system that dispenses controlled volumes of fluid may be affected similarly. A simple model based on Stokes' law suggests that the cell concentration in the bottom of the reservoir should increase linearly up to some maximum and that the cell concentration in the printed drops should follow this trend. The results show that cell output initially followed the predicted increasing trend, but then peaked and decreased. The timing and rate of the decrease related to the number of use cycles for the cartridges. The results provide guidance for modifications to the printing process to ensure consistent printing of cells.					33rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)33rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBS)	AUG 30-SEP 03, 2011AUG 30-SEP 03, 2011	IEEE; Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS)IEEE; Engn Med & Biol Soc (EMBS)	Boston, MABoston, MA	4	0	0	4	0	4			1557-170X		978-1-4244-4122-8	WOS:000298810002331

Some of the previously proposed physical object search engines use RFID tracking, and others collect the information of object locations into a hierarchical centralized server. The difficulty of widely deploying RFID devices, the centralized search, and the need for periodical location information collection prevent CPS from achieving higher scalability and efficiency. To deal with this problem, we propose a Social-aware distributed Cyber-Physical human-centric Search engine (SCPS) that leverages the social network formed by wireless device users for object search. Without requiring periodical location information collection, SCPS locates objects held by users based on the routine user movement pattern. Moreover, using a social-aware Bayesian network, it can accurately predict the users' locations when exceptional events (e. g., inclement weather) occur, which breaks user movement pattern. Thus, SCPS is more advantageous than all previous social network based works which assume that user behaviors always follow a certain pattern. Further, SCPS conducts the search in a fully distributed manner by relying on a DHT structure. As a result, SCPS achieves high scalability, efficiency and location accuracy. Extensive real-trace driven simulation results show the superior performance of SCPS compared to other representative search methods.					54th Annual IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference (GLOBECOM)54th Annual IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference (GLOBECOM)	DEC 05-09, 2011DEC 05-09, 2011	IEEEIEEE	Houston, TXHouston, TX	0	0	0	0	0	0			1930-529X		978-1-4244-9268-8	WOS:000300509004119

Unique to battery-electric vehicles is the direct inverse relationship between these parameters. Battery pack costs often account for over one half of the vehicle cost, with the vehicle range determined by the capacity (and thus cost) of the battery pack as well. An increase in vehicle range would therefore result in a significant increase in battery pack cost, and vice versa. In addition, the relationship between overall vehicle mass and total range further inversely couples vehicle cost and range. It is apparent then that a fundamental trade-off will always exist between the two parameters, unless an additional factor is added to decouple the direct relationship between them. This study analytically investigates the aforementioned relationships unique to battery-electric vehicles and proposes inductively coupled power transfer (ICPT) as a potential solution and decoupling method for the vehicle range - vehicle cost relationship.

The need to manage the applications in cloud computing creates the challenge of on-demand resource provisioning and allocation in response to dynamically changing workloads. Currently most of these existing methods focused on the optimization of allocating physical resources to their associated virtual resources and migrating virtual machines to achieve load balance and increase resource utilization. Unfortunately, these methods require the suspension of the cloud computing applications due to the mandatory shutdown of the associated virtual machines. In this paper, we study the resource allocation at the application level, instead of studying how to map the physical resources to virtual resources for better resource utilization in cloud computing environment. We propose a threshold-based dynamic resource allocation scheme for cloud computing that dynamically allocate the virtual resources (virtual machines) among the cloud computing applications based on their load changes (instead of allocating resources needed to meet peak demands) and can use the threshold method to optimize the decision of resource reallocation. The proposed threshold-based dynamic resource allocation scheme is implemented by using CloudSim, and experimental results show the proposed scheme can improve resource utilization and reduce the user usage cost.

J	Meadows, Inga M.; Jeffers, Steven N.								Distribution and recovery of Phytophthora cinnamomi in soils of mixed hardwood-pine forests of the south-eastern USA								New Zealand Journal of Forestry Science				41	Suppl. S			S39	S47					2011	2011	Inconsistent recovery of Phytophthora cinnamomi Rands from forest soils has been documented in climates with seasonally wet and dry periods. Phytophthora cinnamomi can be recovered when soils are moist or wet but can be difficult to recover from dry soil. Recovery may be complicated further by the physical location of P. cinnamomi in soil. Our objectives were: (1) to investigate factors that might affect recovery of P. cinnamomi from dry soil-i.e. length of time remoistened soil was stored, storage temperature, and presence of host tissue; and (2) to determine the spatial distribution of this organism in forest soil. Recovery of P. cinnamomi from soil samples that had been dried and then remoistened was very rare (1/90 samples); therefore, additional studies are needed to better understand the factors that affect recovery of P. cinnamomi from, and the viability of propagules present in, dry soil. Spatial distribution of P. cinnamomi was examined using three grids at each of three forest sites. Horizontal distribution was determined at 30-cm intervals along the soil surface of each grid. Phytophthora cinnamomi was found in soil samples in seven of the nine grids and was recovered in 14 to 97% of the samples from those grids. Vertical distribution at standard depths (0, 6, 23, 40, 57, and 74 cm) was studied in 13 soil cores collected at the three forest sites. Phytophthora cinnamomi was present in 85% of vertical cores, occurred more frequently near the soil surface than at any other depth, was detected up to 74 cm below the surface, and often was not contiguous in a core.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0048-0134	1179-5395		BCI:BCI201100592194

The risk for the trajectories is evaluated by calculating the area of the cross section of the fuzzy danger zones in the operator's path. The workplace is discretised into rectangular cells, and the optimal trajectory is approximated by a polygon, connecting the centres of ordered cells. This method is adapted for both determining the optimal operator paths and simulating the operator behaviour in the virtual engineering platforms. The results are useful to develop emergency safety procedures, risk concept training and to evaluate safety in the workplace.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0951-192X			WOS:000286660400001

The reference intensity is easy to be tuned by altering the index of the match oil to optimize the signal to noise ratio of the system. An external Michelson interferometer is used to compensate for the optical path difference and dispersion mismatch to the index-match oil and the GRIN lens. Due to this common-path design, the OCT signal is immune to bending or stretching of the endoscopic catheter. The outer diameter of the probe is 3 mm, and 22 circumferential-scans and 50,000 lines A-scans are obtained in one second.

The ultracapacitor's high power capabilities make it a good choice for this application. The optimal control technique of Dynamic Programming (DP) is applied to obtain the "best possible" fuel economy for the vehicle over the driving cycle under pointwise-in-time hard system constraints. Attainable fuel economy improvements are illustrated using a real-time implementable Model Predictive Control (MPC) method using a simple model for predicting future torque demands. The incorporation of simulated telematic future information is also investigated to further improve the the fuel economy of the MPC method close to the DP-calculated maximum.

This controller is capable of dealing with uncertainties such as tip mass, damping coefficients and the complicated nature of the nonlinear interaction force present in the AFM systems. For this, a distributed-parameters based model for microcantilever with a tip mass is developed. On the other hand, a general interaction force between the tip and surface of the sample is assumed here which affects the microcantilever's response and due to its intrinsic nonlinearity, it adds complexity to the system. Simulation results demonstrate that proposed adaptive controller is capable of precise trajectory tracking with various applications in manipulation of and imaging systems.

A robust thermal management system is needed to provide the required heat transfer, especially while operating in harsh conditions such as elevated ambient temperatures. While liquid cooling combined with phase change materials has been shown to provide significant improvements in cooling performance, it is desired to develop a system capable of cooling electronic devices without endurance restrictions. By combining a nanoparticle enhanced coolant rail with thermoelectric coolers, reliable heat transfer can be provided for the electronic equipment. Additionally, a remote multiple loop cooling system maintains cooling efficiency while providing packaging flexibility applicable to modern computational systems with space constraints. A mathematical system model has been created and numerically simulated to evaluate different cooling configurations to demonstrate the overall effectiveness while operating in elevated ambient temperatures. The results show that the proposed system maintains low computer chip temperatures while compartmentalizing the heat transfer process essentially away from the thermal load.

The magnitude of the saturation, which can be interpreted as a slip-angle deficiency, is determined from estimated nonlinear axle lateral forces and comparisons with linear projections that use estimates of the cornering stiffness. Once known, the per-axle saturation levels are employed in a saturation balancing control structure that biases the drive/brake torque to either the front or rear axles with the goal of minimizing excessive under- or over-steer. The approach is then combined with a direct yaw-moment controller to obtain enhanced stability and responsiveness. The benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated for a nominally unstable vehicle in an extreme obstacle avoidance type maneuver.

IEEE					Creation of a Driver Preference Objective Metric to Evaluate Ground Vehicle Steering Systems								2011 AMERICAN CONTROL CONFERENCE		Proceedings of the American Control Conference												2011	2011	The evaluation of vehicle steering systems has typically been performed by engineers and consumer focus groups using in-vehicle and automotive simulator studies. In the latter case, driver preferences have been extensively gathered using written questionnaires. However, this delays the testing procedure and may introduce outside influences that may skew the results. In this paper, an objective steering preference metric has been created to gather steering preferences without directly communicating with the driver. Streaming vehicle data has been recorded, processed, and correlated with subjective response data to create a global steering preference metric. A combination of the vehicle's yaw rate, longitudinal acceleration, and lateral acceleration demonstrated an excellent correlation with survey responses regardless of the steering setting. Furthermore, changes in the steering ratio resulted in an even stronger correlation between the objective data (longitudinal acceleration, front tire angle, and throttle position) and test subject questionnaire responses. Overall, the proposed index offers a unique approach to evaluate steering system designs.

VAPORIZATION OF BICOMPONENT DROPLETS EXPOSED TO ASYMMETRIC RADIANT HEATING								COMBUSTION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				183	12			1412	1432		10.1080/00102202.2011.604367			2011	2011	In this work, the fuel vapor distribution around vaporizing bicomponent droplets, exposed to asymmetric radiant heating, is investigated as an extension of prior work done by the authors involving single-component droplets. Acetone/octane and acetone/hexane mixtures (50/50 by volume) are used to explore bicomponent droplet phenomena within the context of asymmetric radiant heating. Planar laser-induced fluorescence images yield acetone vapor molar fraction contour plots, which reveal details of the asymmetries in the vapor distribution. Subsequent analysis of these contour plots leads to conclusions as to the influences of droplet size, droplet component properties, radiant heating temperature, and exposure time based on the characteristics of the vaporization process, including the apparent induction of Stefan flows above the droplet surface. Such phenomena have relevance to the overall fuel vaporization process as well as subsequent ignition and pollutant formation processes.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0010-2202			WOS:000296965700008

We show in this paper how the Resource Description Framework (RDF), which is a standard for the fundamental data structures of the Semantic Web, and algebraic graph transformations on these data structures can be used to realise the abstract syntax of such DSMLs. We examine a small DSML for IT infrastructures as an application scenario. From this scenario, we derive distributed modelling, evolution of language definitions, migration of legacy models and integration of modelling languages as key requirements for a DSML framework. RDF and transformation rules are then used to provide a solution, which meets these requirements, where all kinds of modifications-from simple editing steps via model migration to language integration-are realised by the single, uniform formalism of algebraic graph transformation.					3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering	OCT 12-13, 2010OCT 12-13, 2010	Assoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci ResAssoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci Res	Eindhoven, NETHERLANDSEindhoven, NETHERLANDS	1	0	0	0	0	1			0302-9743		978-3-642-19439-9	WOS:000296827000006

We designed Clafer as a concise notation for meta-models, feature models, mixtures of meta- and feature models (such as components with options), and models that couple feature models and meta-models via constraints (such as mapping feature configurations to component configurations or model templates). Clafer also allows arranging models into multiple specialization and extension layers via constraints and inheritance. We identify four key mechanisms allowing a meta-modeling language to express feature models concisely and show that Clafer meets its design objectives using a sample product line. We evaluated Clafer and how it lends itself to analysis on sample feature models, meta-models, and model templates of an E-Comrnerce platform.					3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering	OCT 12-13, 2010OCT 12-13, 2010	Assoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci ResAssoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci Res	Eindhoven, NETHERLANDSEindhoven, NETHERLANDS	12	0	0	0	0	12			0302-9743		978-3-642-19439-9	WOS:000296827000007

In the context of C++, a specification of requirements for a template argument or a set of template arguments is called a concept.In this paper, we present a novel tool, TACE (template analysis and concept extraction), designed to help programmers understand the requirements that their code de facto imposes on arguments and help simplify and generalize those through comparisons with libraries of well-defined and precisely-specified concepts. TACE automatically extracts requirements from the body of function templates. These requirements are expressed using the notation and semantics developed by the ISO C++ standards committee. TACE converts implied requirements into concept definitions and compares them against concepts from a repository. Components of a well-defined library exhibit commonalities that allow us to detect problems by comparing requirements from many components: Design and implementation problems manifest themselves as minor variations in requirements. TACE points to source code that cannot be constrained by concepts and to code where small modifications would allow the use of less constraining concepts. For people who use a version of C++ with concept support, TACE can serve as a core engine for automated source code rejuvenation.					3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering	OCT 12-13, 2010OCT 12-13, 2010	Assoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci ResAssoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci Res	Eindhoven, NETHERLANDSEindhoven, NETHERLANDS	0	0	0	0	0	0			0302-9743		978-3-642-19439-9	WOS:000296827000008

GMF relies on a family of modeling languages to describe abstract syntax, concrete syntax as well as other aspects of the visual language and its implementation in an editor. GMF uses a model-driven approach to map the different GMF models to Java code. The framework, as it stands, lacks support for evolution. In particular, there is no support for propagating changes from the domain model (i.e., the abstract syntax of the visual language) to other editor models. We analyze the resulting co-evolution challenge, and we provide a solution by means of GMF model adapters, which automate the propagation of domain-model changes. These GMF model adapters are special model-to-model transformations that are driven by difference models for domain-model changes.					3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering	OCT 12-13, 2010OCT 12-13, 2010	Assoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci ResAssoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci Res	Eindhoven, NETHERLANDSEindhoven, NETHERLANDS	2	0	0	0	0	2			0302-9743		978-3-642-19439-9	WOS:000296827000009		
S	Herrmannsdoerfer, Markus; Vermolen, Sander D.; Wachsmuth, Guido						Malloy, B; Staab, S; VanDenBrand, M		An Extensive Catalog of Operators for the Coupled Evolution of Metamodels and Models								SOFTWARE LANGUAGE ENGINEERING		Lecture Notes in Computer Science		6563				163	+					2011	2011	Modeling languages and thus their metamodels are subject to change. When a metamodel is evolved, existing models may no longer conform to it. Manual migration of these models in response to metamodel evolution is tedious and error-prone. To significantly automate model migration, operator-based approaches provide reusable coupled operators that encapsulate both metamodel evolution and model migration. The success of an operator-based approach highly depends on the library of reusable coupled operators it provides. In this paper, we thus present an extensive catalog of coupled operators that is based both on a literature survey as well as real-life case studies. The catalog is organized according to a number of criteria to ease assessing the impact on models as well as selecting the right operator for a metamodel change at hand.					3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering	OCT 12-13, 2010OCT 12-13, 2010	Assoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci ResAssoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci Res	Eindhoven, NETHERLANDSEindhoven, NETHERLANDS	17	0	0	0	0	17			0302-9743		978-3-642-19439-9	WOS:000296827000010

However, while non-bijectivity in bidirectional transformations is considered relevant, current languages still lack of a common understanding of its semantic implications hampering their applicability in practice.In this paper, the Janus Transformation Language (JTL) is presented, a bidirectional model transformation language specifically designed to support non-bijective transformations and change propagation. In particular, the language propagates changes occurring in a model to one or more related models according to the specified transformation regardless of the transformation direction. Additionally, whenever manual modifications let a model be non reachable anymore by a transformation, the closest model which approximate the ideal source one is inferred. The language semantics is also presented and its expressivity and applicability are validated against a reference benchmark. JTL is embedded in a framework available on the Eclipse platform which aims to facilitate the use of the approach, especially in the definition of model transformations.					3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering	OCT 12-13, 2010OCT 12-13, 2010	Assoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci ResAssoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci Res	Eindhoven, NETHERLANDSEindhoven, NETHERLANDS	9	0	0	0	0	9			0302-9743		978-3-642-19439-9	WOS:000296827000011

However, these conventional meanings are implicit and vague, leading to various forms of ambiguity. This is problematic since it hurts the readability and maintainability of programs. Java programmers would benefit greatly from a more well-defined vocabulary. Identifying synonyms in the vocabulary of verbs used in method names is a step towards this goal. By rooting the meaning of verbs in the semantics of a large number of methods taken from real-world Java applications, we find that such synonyms can readily be identified. To support our claims, we demonstrate automatic identification of synonym candidates. This could be used as a starting point for a manual canonicalisation process, where redundant verbs are eliminated from the vocabulary.					3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering	OCT 12-13, 2010OCT 12-13, 2010	Assoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci ResAssoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci Res	Eindhoven, NETHERLANDSEindhoven, NETHERLANDS	1	0	0	0	0	1			0302-9743		978-3-642-19439-9	WOS:000296827000014

Consequently, an increasing number of modeling languages are built using metamodel-based language workbenches. In response to changing requirements and technologies, the modeling languages and thus their metamodels need to be adapted. Manual migration of existing models in response to metamodel adaptation is tedious and error-prone. In this paper, we present our tool COPE to automate the coupled evolution of metamodels and models. To not lose the intention behind the adaptation, COPE records the coupled evolution in an explicit history model. Based on this history model, COPE provides advanced tool support to inspect, refactor and recover the coupled evolution.					3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering	OCT 12-13, 2010OCT 12-13, 2010	Assoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci ResAssoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci Res	Eindhoven, NETHERLANDSEindhoven, NETHERLANDS	6	0	0	0	0	6			0302-9743		978-3-642-19439-9	WOS:000296827000018

Quotations of concrete syntax fragments and anti-quotations for meta-level expressions and variables are used to manipulate the abstract representation of programs. These small, isolated fragments are often ambiguous and must be explicitly disambiguated with quotation tags or types, using names from the non-terminals of the object language syntax. Discoverability of these names has been an open issue, as they depend on the (grammar) implementation and are not part of the concrete syntax of a language. Based on advances in interactive development environments, we introduce interactive disambiguation to address this issue, providing real-time feedback and proposing quick fixes in case of ambiguities.					3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering	OCT 12-13, 2010OCT 12-13, 2010	Assoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci ResAssoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci Res	Eindhoven, NETHERLANDSEindhoven, NETHERLANDS	0	0	0	0	0	0			0302-9743		978-3-642-19439-9	WOS:000296827000022

Since their introduction, feature models have been extended and formalised in various ways. The majority of these extensions are variants of the original tree-based graphical notation. But over time, textual dialects have also been proposed. The textual variability language (TVL) was proposed to combine the advantages of both graphical and textual notations. However, its benefits and limitations have not been empirically evaluated up to now. In this paper, we evaluate TVL with four cases from companies of different sizes and application domains. The study shows that practitioners can benefit from TVL. The participants appreciated the notation, the advantages of a textual language and considered the learning curve to be gentle. The study also reveals some limitations of the current version of TVL.					3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering	OCT 12-13, 2010OCT 12-13, 2010	Assoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci ResAssoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci Res	Eindhoven, NETHERLANDSEindhoven, NETHERLANDS	3	0	0	0	0	3			0302-9743		978-3-642-19439-9	WOS:000296827000023

Although the current language specification recognises the importance of defining a visual notation carefully, it; does so by relying on common sense, intuition and emulation of common practices, rather than by adopting a rigorous scientific approach. This results in a number of suboptimal language design decisions that may impede effective model-mediated communication between stakeholders. We demonstrate and illustrate this by looking at BPMN 2.0 through the lens of the Physics of Notations, a collection of evidence-based principles that together form a theory of notation design. This work can be considered a first step towards making BPMN 2.0's visual notation more cognitively effective.					3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering3rd International Conference on Software Language Engineering	OCT 12-13, 2010OCT 12-13, 2010	Assoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci ResAssoc Comp Machinery; ASML; IBM; Jacquard; NWO, Netherlands Org Sci Res	Eindhoven, NETHERLANDSEindhoven, NETHERLANDS	24	0	0	0	0	24			0302-9743		978-3-642-19439-9	WOS:000296827000025

Due to the limited computing and energy resources available on existing hardware platforms, achieving high precision classification of high-level events in-network is a challenge, hi this paper, we present a new classification technique for identifying events of interest on resource-lean sensors. The approach introduces an innovative condensed kd-tree data structure to represent processed sensor data and uses a fast nearest neighbor search to determine the likelihood of class membership for incoming samples. The classifier consumes limited resources and provides high precision classification. To evaluate the approach, two case studies are considered, in the contexts of human movement and vehicle navigation, respectively. The classification accuracy is above 85% across the two case studies.					8th European Conference on Wireless Sensor Networks8th European Conference on Wireless Sensor Networks	FEB 23-25, 2011FEB 23-25, 2011	Univ Duisburg Essen,Networked Embedded Syst Grp; CONET, Network of Excellence; Boeing; LibeliumUniv Duisburg Essen,Networked Embedded Syst Grp; CONET, Network of Excellence; Boeing; Libelium	Bonn, GERMANYBonn, GERMANY	2	0	0	0	0	2			0302-9743		978-3-642-19185-5	WOS:000296829600005

The bulk of this growth comes from low revenue internet traffic. Naturally, this raises interest in lowering the costs of building and maintaining the transport network. It is here that some make the case for OTN switching as low-cost alternative to IP/MPLS core networks. To compare and contrast the costs of OTN versus MPLS, we undertook multiple modeling exercises. The preliminary results show that the optimal network design depends on different parameters, such as: ratio of peak to average flow demands, number of simultaneous peak demands, ratio of MPLS to OTN port costs and size of core transport interconnects. We review our model, assumptions and outcome, and highlight the impact on product and network architecture.

Stephen								Leadership and quality management practices in Thailand								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT				31	9-10			1048	1070		10.1108/01443571111172426			2011	2011	Purpose - This study aims to examine the effects of leadership behaviors on quality management (QM) practices and their effects on quality performance of manufacturing companies in Thailand. The hypotheses were that leadership leads to infrastructure practices, which in turn support quality practices. These quality practices improve quality performance. This was tested using a structural equation model. In general, the model was supported although all of the individual practices examined here were not statistically significant.Design/methodology/approach - A survey of quality managers of firms located within Thailand was conducted and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) to determine how leadership affected quality practices which in turn affected quality performance. The interactions of leadership with infrastructure and core variables were tested and found to be insignificant.Findings - The SEM established that leadership behaviors supported one infrastructure practice - human resource management, which in turn supported one core QM practice - statistical process control. While six dimensions of transformational and two dimensions of transactional analysis were tested, only two dimensions of transformational and one dimension of transactional leadership were retained. However, these did load onto one leadership second-order factor. The interactions of leadership with infrastructure and core practices were not significant. The core practices significantly affected three quality performance measures - product returns, product rework and scrap levels.Research limitations/implications - Further investigation is needed to understand how the Thai culture affects the use of quality practices. Since there was only one respondent per company, the study needs additional validation. Further investigation of the transformational and transactional leadership constructs is necessary.Practical implications - This suggests to international managers that many of the quality techniques are useful in both developing countries and developed countries. It also suggests that transactional leadership was more effective than prior literature expected it be.Originality/value - This paper demonstrates that leadership in Thailand is important to the implementation of quality practices. The findings indicate that leadership is an important component of QM and affects infrastructure practices which in turn affect core quality practices. Finally, these core practices affect quality performance. This confirms prior QM models. A major finding is the importance of the contingent punishment dimension of transactional leadership. The confirmatory factor analysis suggests that the individual dimensions of transformational and transactional leadership are not reliable as currently operationalized and further work is needed to develop reliable leadership scales.									13	0	0	0	0	13			0144-3577	1758-6593		WOS:000296656700006

A New Static Strength Test for Characterization of Rutting of Dense-Graded Asphalt Mixtures								JOURNAL OF TESTING AND EVALUATION				39	1			59	68		10.1520/JTE102385			JAN 2011	2011	A new static-test protocol was developed for measuring the deformation resistance of asphalt mixtures at high temperature, 60 degrees C. A round edge loading head was used for estimating rut-related performance by statically pressing a specimen at the flat top center. The value measured by this test is considered as a strength against deformation or deformation strength and designated as "S-D" The S-D has shown a high correlation with the rut depths of wheel tracking (WT) and the asphalt pavement analyzer (APA) tests. In this study, the feasibility of utilizing this test method to predict the rutting potential of asphalt mixtures is shown. Stiffness (G*/sin delta) test data for asphalt binders, two rutting tests' (WT and APA) data, and S-D data for various laboratory mixtures were used in this evaluation. More than 50 field mixtures were also used for APA and S-D tests. Correlation analyses showed that the S-D had very high correlation with the stiffness of the binder (R-2 = 0.9), with rut depth of WT (R-2 > 0.90) and somewhat less with rut depth of APA (R-2 = 0.77). It was concluded that the newly developed test is comparable to WT and APA and that the S-D is a property providing a reasonable estimation of rut potential of asphalt mixtures at high temperatures, even though it is a static-test property.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0090-3973	1945-7553		WOS:000296756900008

Modeling the Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index (RAPI): A comparison of statistical methods								ADDICTION RESEARCH & THEORY				19	6			510	518		10.3109/16066359.2011.569100			2011	2011	Introduction: The Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index (RAPI) is a scale designed to identify alcohol-related problems experienced by adolescents and young adults. RAPI scores tend to be skewed due in part to a substantial proportion of zero scores. In this study, we compared different statistical models for analyzing the RAPI as an outcome measure using data collected as part of an alcohol intervention program for college freshmen. Predictors included intervention group indicators. Model fit, predictive ability and practicality of implementation were compared among competing models and recommendations are made.Results: Of 558 students who completed the baseline survey (68% response rate), 76% completed a 3-month follow-up survey. Mean RAPI scores were 4.7 (SD = 6.0) at baseline and 4.6 (SD = 5.5) at 3 months. Significance of intervention group differences at 3 months adjusting for baseline RAPI were heavily dependent upon the type of statistical model employed. A zero-inflated (ZI) negative binomial model provided the best model fit.Conclusions: This study demonstrated that inferences and conclusions about intervention efficacy were method-dependent in analysis of RAPI scores. There was empirical evidence of improved inference when methods accounting for zero-inflation and skewness were employed.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1606-6359			WOS:000296015400004		
J	Sandi-Urena, Santiago; Cooper, Melanie M.; Gatlin, Todd A.; Bhattacharyya, Gautam								Students' experience in a general chemistry cooperative problem based laboratory								CHEMISTRY EDUCATION RESEARCH AND PRACTICE				12	4			434	442		10.1039/c1rp90047a			2011	2011	Most educators and scientists would agree that science laboratory instruction has the potential of developing science practices fundamental to achieving scientific literacy. However, there is scant evidence to support that this potential is realized, particularly in tertiary level education. This paper reports qualitative results from a sequential explanatory mixed methods study aimed at investigating the effectiveness of a college, cooperative, project-based General Chemistry Laboratory in promoting student learning. Quantitative findings showed that students in this programme increased their ability and metacognitive strategies in solving online ill-structured chemistry problems. For the current study, we used a phenomenological approach to investigate the essence of students' experiences in this learning environment. Eleven participants volunteered to take part in in-depth, open-ended interviews. Phenomenological data reduction, analysis and interpretation produced an outcome space composed of three dimensions (Affective Response, Understanding of the Learning Experience, and Strategic Response). The need to 'take charge of learning' emerged as the interconnecting factor bringing cohesiveness to the experience. These findings are consistent with the previous quantitative report. Additionally, they support the notion that immersion in a lab environment appropriately designed to constantly challenge students to think through problems and figure out solutions does indeed promote metacognition and problem solving skills. Situating learning in this context facilitates meaningful self-discovery and internalization of strategies as opposed to externally introducing them. We believe that these findings contribute evidence of the relationship between experiences in the laboratory and student effective learning and can inform and guide curricular development.									20	0	0	0	0	20			1109-4028			WOS:000296162100005

Three imaging features, joint space width, optical absorption, and scattering coefficients, are employed to train a Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) classifier for osteoarthritis classification. The 10-fold validation results show that all osteoarthritis joints are clearly identified and all healthy joints are ruled out by the LS-SVM classifier. The best sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of the classification by experienced technicians based on manual calculation of optical properties and visual examination of optical images are only 85%, 93%, and 90%, respectively. Therefore, our LS-SVM based computer-aided classification is a considerably improved method for osteoarthritis diagnosis.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0895-3996			WOS:000296146500009	25214385	
J	Seeber, Michael; Zdyrko, Bogdan; Burtovvy, Ruslan; Andrukh, Taras; Tsai, Chen-Chin; Owens, Jeffery R.; Kornev, Konstantin G.; Luzinov, Igor								Surface grafting of thermoresponsive microgel nanoparticles								SOFT MATTER				7	21			9962	9971		10.1039/c1sm05924f			2011	2011	A monolayer of thermoresponsive microgel nanoparticles, containing poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM), has been anchored to the surface of silicon wafers, glass slides, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) fibers, and tungsten wires using a "grafting to'' approach. The behavior of the synthesized grafted layers is compared with the behavior of the PNIPAM brushes (densely end-grafted layers). The comparison demonstrates that in many aspects the microgel grafted layer is comparable to PNIPAM brushes with respect to its thermoresponsive properties. Indeed, the grafted monolayer swells and collapses reversibly at temperatures below and above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of PNIPAM. For the flat silicon substrate, a wettability study of the grafted layer shows an approximately 20 degrees increase in the advancing contact angle of water upon heating above the LCST of PNIPAM. Wettability data obtained for the tungsten wires indicate that the grafted microgel layer retains its ability to undergo morphological changes when exposed to external temperature variations on complex curved surfaces. Therefore, the microgel-grafted layer can be considered as a system capable of competing with the PNIPAM brushes.									12	0	0	0	0	12			1744-683X			WOS:000296026700023

While the theory of low-Reynolds-number locomotion is well studied for unbounded fluid domains, the presence of a boundary has a significant influence on the swimmer's trajectories and poses problems of dynamic stability of its motion. In this paper we consider a simple theoretical model of a microswimmer near a wall, study its dynamics, and analyze the stability of its motion. We highlight the underlying geometric structure of the dynamics, and establish a relation between the reversing symmetry of the system and existence and stability of periodic and steady solutions of motion near the wall. The results are demonstrated by numerical simulations and validated by motion experiments with macroscale robotic swimmer prototypes.									11	1	0	1	0	12			1536-0040			WOS:000295404300008		
J	Gerrard, A. J.; Meriwether, J. W.								Initial daytime and nighttime SOFDI observations of thermospheric winds from Fabry-Perot Doppler shift measurements of the 630-nm OI line-shape profile								ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE				29	9			1529	1536		10.5194/angeo-29-1529-2011			2011	2011	In this paper we present both night and day thermospheric wind observations made with the Second-generation, Optimized, Fabry-Perot Doppler Imager (SOFDI), a novel triple-etalon Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) designed to make 24-h measurements of thermospheric winds from OI 630-nm emission. These results were obtained from the northeastern United States and from under the magnetic equator at Huancayo, Peru and demonstrate the current instrument capability for measurements of Doppler shifts for either night or day. We found the uncertainties in the measurements agree with expected values based upon forward modeling calculations; nighttime wind components having an uncertainty of similar to 20-m s(-1) at 30-min resolution and daytime wind components having an uncertainty of similar to 70-m s(-1) at 20-min resolution. The nighttime uncertainties are typically larger than those seen with traditional single-etalon FPIs, which occur at the cost of being able to achieve daytime measurements. The thermospheric wind measurements from Huancayo replicate recently reported CHAMP zonal winds and are in disagreement with current empirical wind climatologies. In addition, we discuss the incorporation of how multiple point heads in the SOFDI instrument will allow for unique studies of gravity wave activity in future measurements.									10	1	0	1	0	11			0992-7689	1432-0576		WOS:000295399100002

These techniques attempt to allow the clinician to not only visualize what is currently visible, but also what is beneath the surface, or function. These systems are often based on tracking systems coupled with registration and visualization technologies. The accuracy and precision of the tracking systems, thus is critical in the overall accuracy and precision of the image-guidance system. In this work the accuracy and precision of an Aurora tracking system is assessed, using the technique specified in "novel technique for analysis of accuracy of magnetic tracking systems used in image guided surgery." This analysis yielded a demonstration that accuracy is dependent on distance from the tracker's field generator, and had an RMS value of 1.48 mm. The error has the similar characteristics and values as the previous work, thus validating this method for tracker analysis.

B	Foulk, Jonn; Akin, Danny; Dodd, Roy; Ulven, Chad						Kalia, S; Kaith, BS; Kaur, I		Production of Flax Fibers for Biocomposites								CELLULOSE FIBERS: BIO- AND NANO-POLYMER COMPOSITES: GREEN CHEMISTRY AND TECHNOLOGY								61	95		10.1007/978-3-642-17370-7_3	10.1007/978-3-642-17370-7		2011	2011	Natural fibers for many and varied industrial uses are a current area of intense interest. Production of these fibers, furthermore, can add to farmer incomes and promote agricultural sustainability. Flax (Linum usitatissimum L.), which has been used for thousands of years, is unparalleled in supplying natural fibers for industrial applications as diverse as textiles and paper, providing high value linseed and fiber from a single plant, and maintaining sustainable agriculture in temperate and subtropical climates for summer or winter production, respectively. As a value-added replacement for glass fiber from a renewable resource, flax fiber is recyclable, biodegradable, and sustainable for the economy, ecology, and society. To the point, Daintier Chrysler reported that natural fibers for automotive components required 83% less energy and were 40% less expensive than glass fiber components. A better understanding of the fiber characteristics that influence composite performance could lead to the development of additives, coatings, binders, or sizing suitable for natural fiber and a variety of polymeric matrices. Stems of flax require retting to separate fiber from nonfiber components and rigorous mechanical cleaning to obtain industrial-grade fibers. Considerable work has been undertaken to improve the retting process using specific cell-free enzymes, especially pectinases, to control and tailor properties for industrial applications. Fiber processing and use in composites are affected by variables such as length, uniformity, strength, toughness, fineness, surface constituents, surface characteristics, and contaminants. One of the main concerns for the composite and other industries in incorporating natural fibers, such as flax, into production parts is the fiber variability resulting from crop diversity, retting quality, and different processing techniques. Standardized methods to assess flax fiber properties, therefore, are needed to maintain quality from crop to crop and provide a means to grade fibers for processing efficiency and applications. Other parts of the plant stalk, notably the waste shive and dust, can potentially be utilized as coproducts to offset costs for producing the major products of fiber and seed.									5	0	0	0	0	5					978-3-642-17369-1	WOS:000291580900003

This tutorial employs simulation and analytic methodologies for the performance modelling and optimisation of DOCSIS 1.1/2.0 HFC networks with particular focus on the contention resolution algorithm. upstream bandwidth allocation strategies. flow-priority scheduling disciplines. QoS provisioning and TCP applications. In this context two performance evaluation case studies are reviewed in detail - based respectively on two open queueing network models of DOCSIS 1.1/2.0 HFC networks. The first study evaluates. via 'ns' simulation, the effect of carrying TCP/IP traffic on network performance whilst the second optimises analytically the upstream network bandwidth allocation. It is expected that many of the performance affecting operational behaviours exhibited by former releases of DOCSIS-based HFC networks will also exist under the latest DOCSIS 3.0 protocol and future extensions.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0302-9743		978-3-642-02741-3	WOS:000290879900029

Forest gaps, small openings, and the edges between early successional patches and mature forest are especially important habitats because they are used by both open-adapted and clutter-adapted species. Several bat species select roosts in close proximity to early successional patches, perhaps to minimize foraging and commuting costs. Future research on effects of early successional patch size, shape, vegetation structure, and connectivity on bat use, and the distribution of early successional habitats in relation to mature forest, roosting sites, and water sources will assist managers in providing the optimal types and distribution of early successional patches on the landscape.									7	0	0	6	0	7			1568-1319		978-94-007-1619-3	WOS:000294270200010

Natural waters are generally low in nutrient content (i.e., they are oligotrophic); what nutrients there are, are homogeneously distributed in the water. The movement of water freely transports microorganisms; to counter this and offer themselves some protection, many aquatic organisms are either stalked or arranged in colonies immersed in gelatinous materials. To enable free movement in water, many aquatic microorganisms and/or their gametes have locomotory structures such as flagella. Microorganisms are often adapted to, and occupy particular habitats in the water body; some occupy the air-water interphase (neuston), while others live in the sediment of water bodies (benthic). The conditions which affect aquatic microorganisms are temperature, nutrient, light, salinity turbidity, water movement. The methods for the quantitative study of aquatic microorganisms are cultural methods (plate count and MPN), direct methods (microscopy and flow cytometry), and the determination of microbial mass. The microscopy methods are light (optical), epi-flourescence, confocal laser scanning microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. Microbial mass may be direct (weight after oven-drying) or indirect (turbidity, CO2, release, etc).									0	0	0	0	0	0					978-94-007-1459-5	WOS:000293760400002

The photic zone of seas and oceans, about 200 m deep, is the region permeated by sunlight where photosynthesis can take place. It has the greatest biodiversity, and all food for the marine population arises from the photic zone; such food includes marine snow which consists of globules of mucopolyssacharides containing dead and living microorganisms floating downward toward the deep ocean. Marine organisms are adapted to the unique conditions found in the marine open sea (pelagic zone) environment: high salinity (3.5 g/L), low temperature (about 4 degrees C), and high barometric pressure of up to 500 bar depending on the depth. Thermophilic organisms grow near the occasional hot thermal vents where hot magma spews out onto the ocean floor.Using the technique of 16S rRNA, it has been found that over 70% of marine bacteria have not been cultured and hence have no counterparts among known bacteria. Microscopic cyanobacteria (picophytoplankton) make up 15% of all the bacteria. Among them, Synechoccus and Prochlorococcus, predominate and constitute the most abundant photosynthetic microbes on earth, contributing more than 50% of the total marine photosynthesis. Of the cultivated bacteria, Roseobacter spp. form about 15% of the total bacteria, while green non sulfur bacteria make up about 6%.									0	0	0	0	0	0					978-94-007-1459-5	WOS:000293760400006

Pollution therefore occurs when the self-purifying powers of a body of water have not had enough time to remove the pollutant and return itself to its original state. Pollutants in water include bacteria, chemicals, heat and by the addition of organic or inorganic nutrients or eutrophication. Eutrophication causes excesses growth of cyanobacteria or blooms.Pollution by fecal matter is determined principally by the identification of E. coli in water. Water bodies are expected to meet standards of the maximum content of microbial and chemical pollutants set by governments all over the world. The Total Maximum Daily Load (TDML) is a calculation of the maximum amount of a pollutant that a water body can contain and still meet water quality standards set by the regulating authority for a particular water use. Since not all E coli is necessarily of human origin, its source is determined through methods of microbial source tracking.Oil spills are major sources of marine pollution. They are remediated physically by skimmers which collect the oil, adsorption onto suitable materials, the use of dispersants or in-situ burning. Biological methods include addition of nutrients to stimulate the growth of oil-degrading microorganisms, the use of surfactants to emulsify the oil and increase contact between oil and microorganisms, and the introduction of organisms specially adapted to growth on oil.									1	0	0	1	0	1					978-94-007-1459-5	WOS:000293760400007

Therefore raw waters are purified to render them safe for drinking. The processes adopted in municipal water purification include the following: pretreatment (pre-coagulation, pre-disinfection), aeration, coagulation, filtration (slow, rapid, ultrafiltration, carbon filtration), disinfection (chloramines, zonation, ultraviolet light, chlorination) miscellaneous treatments (Fe/Mn removal, deionization, reverse osmosis, algal/odor control, softening, ion-exchange, fluoridation, radioactivity removal, plumbosolvency removal). Which of the processes is actually employed depends on the quality of the raw water, the regulations of the appropriate authorities, and the budgetary considerations of the operator. The world over, regulatory authorities decide the maximum contaminants permissible in drinking water and recreational water; thus, the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), the European Union Environmental Agency (EEA), the World Health Organization (WHO), and governmental agencies around the world all set standards, which differ from one another, and which reflect the level of economic, social, and technical expectations and accomplishments of the constituencies to which the standards are addressed.									0	0	0	0	0	0					978-94-007-1459-5	WOS:000293760400009

Performance of Warm-Mix Asphalt Mixtures Containing Recycled Coal Ash and Roofing Shingles with Moist Aggregates for Low-Volume Roads								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD					2205			48	57		10.3141/2205-07			2011	2011	The objective of this study was to evaluate the laboratory moisture and rutting susceptibility of low-volume hot-mix asphalt (HMA) and warm-mix asphalt (WMA) mixtures containing moist aggregates and recycled materials such as manufactured roofing shingles and coal ash. The test properties of these mixtures included indirect tensile strength, tensile strength ratio, flow value, and rut depth of dry and wet specimens. The experimental design included two percentages of coal ash (10% and 5% by weight of the aggregate), two shingle contents (5% and 3% by weight of the aggregate), three WMA additives (Aspha-Min, Sasobit, and Evotherm), and two aggregate sources. Thirty-two mix designs were performed, and 256 specimens were tested. Test results indicated that the aggregate source significantly affected moisture and rutting resistance regardless of WMA additive or recycled material type. In addition, dry and wet rut depth values of low-volume mixtures containing moist aggregate generally satisfied the demand of pavement performance without requiring additional treatment. Moreover, the addition of WMA additives in low-volume mixtures was effective and generally showed a similar rut resistance to HMA. The utilization of recycled coal ash and roofing shingles significantly improved moisture and rutting resistance of HMA and WMA mixtures.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0361-1981			WOS:000294743500008

It has a slightly negative charge at the oxygen end and a slight positive charge at the hydrogen end. This makes the water molecule polar, i.e., having poles like a magnet. This property makes water molecules attract each other, thus giving it unique properties such as rising in capillary tubes, plant roots, and blood vessels against gravity. Water has a high latent heat enabling it to absorb large quantities of heat before a rise in temperature; this enables the waters of the oceans to affect the earth's temperature in a gradual manner. Water is an important solvent. Water forms about 71% of the earth's surface, but most of it is saline. Freshwater which is required for domestic and industrial use, and for agriculture forms only about 2.5%. Water is distributed in the atmosphere as clouds; on the earth's surface as oceans, seas, rivers, and lakes; and underground.									0	0	0	0	0	0					978-94-007-1459-5	WOS:000293760400001

Thus, for example, the taxonomy of microorganisms is no longer based mostly on their morphology, but also on the sequence of bases in the genes of the 16S RNA of the small subunit of the ribosomes. This chapter looks at selected basic molecular biology topics of relevance to the environment. The processes of transcription and translation in protein synthesis are discussed. The principles behind some molecular procedures such as the polymerase chain reaction and micro-arrays are discussed. Many microorganisms in environments such as water and soil are not culturable and are studied only with molecular biology. Metagenomics, or the culture-independent genomic analysis of an assemblage of microorganisms, in environments such as marine or freshwater has potential to answer fundamental questions in microbial ecology.									0	0	0	0	0	0					978-94-007-1459-5	WOS:000293760400003

Globally, freshwaters are scarce commodities and make up only 0.009% of the earth's total water. Although they generate only about 3% of the earth's total primary biological productivity, they contain about 40% of the world's known fish species. Natural freshwaters are classifiable into atmospheric, surface, and underground waters each type having a unique microbial ecology. Atmospheric waters lose their microorganisms as they fall as rain or snow. Surface freshwaters are found in rivers and lakes, and contain large and diverse groups of microorganisms. Using molecular methods such as 16S rRNA analysis, which enables the study of unculturable microorganisms, new information regarding freshwater microbial ecology has emerged in recent times: There are more phylogenetic groups of bacteria than are observed by cultural methods; there is a unique and distinct bacterial group, which can be termed "typical freshwater bacteria"; contrary to previous knowledge when aquatic bacteria were thought to be mostly Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria are in fact abundant in freshwaters; finally, marine-fresh-water transitional populations exist in coastal waters. Ground waters suffer contamination from chemicals and less from microorganisms; the deeper the groundwater, the less likely it is to contain microorganisms, which are filtered away by soil.									1	0	0	1	0	1					978-94-007-1459-5	WOS:000293760400005

Diseases transmitted through drinking water include bacterial diseases (cholera, dysentery, typhoid, gastrointestinal disorders by E. coli, Yersinia, and Campylobacter), viruses (hepatitis A and E), and protozoan and helminth parasites (Cryptosporidium, Giardia, Entamoeba). Inhalation of aerosols can lead to Legionnaires' disease and tuberculosis, while persons with open wounds can contact infections by Aeromonas and non-tubercular mycobacteria.									0	0	0	0	0	0					978-94-007-1459-5	WOS:000293760400008

Wastes carried in water are described as sewage. It is important to determine the quantity of carbon in sewage so as to know the most appropriate method to use for treating it. One of the most common methods is the Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) which measures the oxygen consumed by microorganisms to degrade the carbon over a 5-day period. Other methods are chemical in nature and related to the potential of the microbial breakdown. These chemical methods are the Permanganate Value (PV) Test, the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Organic Carbon (TOC), Total Suspended Solids (TSS), and Volatile Suspended Solids (VSS).Aerobic methods for disposing of sewage are: the Activated Sludge System, the Trickling Filter, the Rotating Disks, and the Oxidation Pond. Anaerobic methods include the Septic Tank, the Imhoff Tank, and Cesspools. Advanced wastewater treatment (AWT) methods are expensive and used for producing water for specialized use. They include: Reverse Osmosis, Nanofiltration, Ultrafiltration and Microfiltration, Electrodialysis, Activated Charcoal, Ion exchange, UV Oxidation, and Precipitation.									0	0	0	0	0	0					978-94-007-1459-5	WOS:000293760400010

Newer methods of treating wastes include plasma arc gasification, in which waste is treated at very high temperatures and pressures, melting the waste into a nontoxic dross and yielding a fuel, syngas, for generating electricity. Pyrolysis operates at about 430 degrees C. Supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) is the destruction technology for organic compounds and toxic materials at very high temperature and pressure, converting them to carbon dioxide, hydrogen to water, and chlorine atoms to chloride ion.									1	0	0	1	0	1					978-94-007-1459-5	WOS:000293760400011

They inhabit all continents and interface with agroecosystems worldwide. Bird migrations across continents and nations make birds a truly global phenomenon of broad but complex conservation appeal. Global agricultural expansion during the past 200 years and intensification in the last 50 have been key drivers in global habitat loss and in declines of about 60% of the birds listed on the IUCN red list. Agricultural intensification is a continued concern as is expansion in tropical areas such as Latin America. Maintaining field-edge and set-aside habitats and using lower-intensity practices in production areas are important options for sustaining bird populations globally. Many key threats to birds in agroecosystems are global but specific impacts and management options may differ among geographical areas. Global climate change creates uncertainties for agriculture and birds, including impacts on bird migration and nesting, and concerns about synchrony between birds, habitats, and food resources. Climate change adds to other existing challenges of habitat loss and fragmentation, urbanization, migration barriers, and uncertain food resources. The push for biofuels has resulted in production intensification and habitat losses, especially removal of set-aside lands. Wildlife-friendly farming approaches can facilitate bird movement in fragmented agroecosystems and can provide important habitat for agricultural species and migratory birds. Wildlife-friendly and land sparing approaches are currently being debated toward the goal of sustaining biodiversity and food production. Global influences from social and political systems affect agroecosystems, people, and birds.Ecotourism may hold potential to benefit local economies, people, and biodiversity if proper and persistent attention is given to ensure these outcomes. Producing food and fiber while, at the same time, sustaining biodiversity and ecosystem services is a challenge for interdisciplinary research in collaboration with working farms and farmers. Research and decision-support tools are needed to facilitate development of policies and infrastructures to support sustainable agriculture and to facilitate conservation of biodiversity in agroecosystems. A conservation vision for the future is needed that embraces the realities of both natural resource limits and human desires for improved quality of life. The positive relationships between people, birds, and sustainable farms may be a key starting point to develop such a vision.									11	0	0	7	0	11			2211-2405		978-94-007-1308-6	WOS:000292895300003

We show that this (consistent) time relaxation term penalizes small-scale fluctuations in the divergence and present efficient algorithms for its use where the filtering and deconvolution steps are decoupled from the momentum-mass system. Several numerical experiments are provided that demonstrate that more accurate solutions with improved mass conservation are obtained by addition of the time relaxation term to some commonly employed finite-element methods, both for Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0020-7160	1029-0265		WOS:000294604100007

Towards sequencing the papaya sex chromosomes, two bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries were constructed from papaya male and female genomic DNA. The female BAC library was constructed using restriction enzyme BstY I and consists of 36,864 clones with an average insert size of 104 kb, providing 10.3x genome equivalents. The male BAC library was constructed using restriction enzyme EcoR I and consists of 55,296 clones with an average insert size of 101 kb, providing 15.0x genome equivalents. The male BAC library was used in constructing the physical map of the male-specific region of the male Y chromosome (MSY) and in filling gaps and extending the physical map of the hermaphrodite-specific region of the Y(h) chromosome (HSY) and the X chromosome physical map. The female BAC library was used to extend the X physical map gap. The MSY, HSY, and X physical maps offer a unique opportunity to study chromosomal rearrangements, Y chromosome degeneration, and dosage compensation of the papaya nascent sex chromosomes.									7	0	0	7	0	7			1110-7243			WOS:000294639500001

Water cylinders of diameters ranging between 17 and 30 cm were used to simulate patients weighing between 20 and 90 kg. X-ray spectra data with peak x-ray tube voltages ranging from 60 to 120 kV were generated using XCOMP3R. Radiation dose distributions inside the water cylinder (D(w)) were obtained using MCNP5. The depth dose distribution along the x-ray beam central axis was normalized to free-in-air air kerma (AK) that is incident on the phantom. Scattered radiation within the water cylinders but outside the directly irradiated region was normalized to the dose at the edge of the radiation field. The total absorbed energy to the directly irradiated volume (E(p)) and indirectly irradiated volume (E(s)) were also determined and investigated as a function of x-ray tube voltage and phantom size.Results: At 80 kV, the average D(w)/AK near the x-ray entrance point was 1.3. The ratio of D(w) near the entrance point to Dw near the exit point increased from similar to 26 for the 17 cm water cylinder to similar to 290 for the 30 cm water cylinder. At 80 kV, the relative dose for a 17 cm water cylinder fell to 0.1% at 49 cm away from the central ray of the x-ray beam. For a 30 cm water cylinder, the relative dose fell to 0.1% at 53 cm away from the central ray of the x-ray beam. At a fixed x-ray tube voltage of 80 kV, increasing the water cylinder diameter from 17 to 30 cm increased the E(s)/(E(p)+E(s)) ratio by about 50%. At a fixed water cylinder diameter of 24 cm, increasing the tube voltage from 60 kV to 120 kV increased the E(s)/(E(p)+E(s)) ratio by about 12%. The absorbed energy from scattered radiation was between 20-30% of the total energy absorbed by the water cylinder, and was affected more by patient size than x-ray beam energy.Conclusion: MCNP offers a powerful tool to study the absorption and transmission of x-ray energy in phantoms that can be designed to represent patients undergoing Interventional Radiological procedures. This ability will permit a systematic investigation of the relationship between patient dose and diagnostic image quality, and thereby keep patient doses As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA).

Normalized scatter fractions (SF) were generated defined as the air kerma at a point of interest that has been normalized by the Kerma Area Product incident on the phantom (i.e., AK/KAP). Three regions surrounding the water cylinder were investigated consisting of the area below the water cylinder (i.e., backscatter), above the water cylinder (i.e., forward scatter) and to the sides of the water cylinder (i.e., side scatter).Results: Immediately above and below the water cylinder and in the side scatter region, values of normalized SF decreased with the inverse square of the distance. For z-planes further away, the decrease was exponential. Values of normalized SF around the phantom were generally less than 10(-4). Changes in normalized SF with x-ray energy were less than 20% and generally decreased with increasing x-ray energy. At a given distance from region where the x-ray beam enters the phantom, the normalized SF was higher in the backscatter regions, and smaller in the forward scatter regions. The ratio of forward to back scatter normalized SF was lowest at 60 keV and highest at 120 keV.Conclusion: Computed SF values quantify the normalized fractional radiation intensities at the operator location relative to the radiation intensities incident on the patient, where the normalization refers to the beam area that is incident on the patient. SF values can be used to estimate the radiation dose received by personnel within the procedure room, and which depend on the imaging geometry, patient size and location within the room. Monte Carlo techniques have the potential for simulating normalized SF values for any arrangement of imaging geometry, patient size and personnel location and are therefore an important tool for minimizing operator doses in IR.

The sequence insertions were used to distinguish Gg isolates from North America obtained from wheat, creeping bentgrass and St. Augustinegrass and to resolve their phylogenetic relationship. Based on the alignment of sequence insertions, Gg isolates were divided into two sets: set I contained all isolates of Ggt; Gga; and Ggg isolates WF 9124, WF 9238, and WF 9463; while set II contained the other Ggg isolates that possessed insertion sequences with different lengths. Phylogenetic analysis of sequence insertions from set I shows that Ggt are more closely related to Gga that is supported by bootstrap 85%. Ggg isolates did not form a distinct group and appeared mixed between the well supported Ggt and Gga groups. Parsimony analysis of Ggg set II insertions revealed a distinct clade consisting of three monophyletic groups.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0815-3191			WOS:000293963900012

An Aircraft Maintenance Technology (AMT) curriculum is the backbone of training and educating maintenance technicians for the aviation industry to function in safe operating conditions. As a part of this research effort, the ViSIns Laboratory (Virtual Simulated Inspection Laboratory) was established at Greenville Technical College, South Carolina, USA; to reduce the gap between high-end technology requirement in the hangar (work environment) and the classroom. Using Bloom's Taxonomy in the cognitive domain, learning objectives of six course modules were refined to create more meaningful student outcomes and mapped to reflect expected student proficiency and goals. The pedagogical material development was extended to integrate two Non-Destructive Inspection (NDI) simulators (borescope and eddy current) in classroom activities and learning as interactive 3D knowledge objects. We present results on student learning using the VR augmentation on different sub-domains of cognition. Our results indicate that VR simulators are effective 3D learning objects which can be used for enhancing deliverables of the AMT education. This study further contributes to engineering education, aircraft maintenance technology education improvement and the use of VR-based simulators in technology driven training environments.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0949-149X			WOS:000293820700011

The disparity is related to the depth of the objects in the scene. Being able to obtain the depth of the objects in the scene is useful in many applications such as virtual reality, 3D user interfaces, background-foreground segmentation, or depth-image-based synthesis. This last application has motivated the proposed algorithm as part of a system that estimates disparities from a stereo pair and synthesizes new views. Synthesizing virtual views enables the post-processing of 3D content to adapt to user preferences or viewing conditions, as well as enabling the interface with multi-view auto-stereoscopic displays. The proposed algorithm has been designed to fulfill the following constraints: (a) low memory requirements, (b) local and parallelizable processing, and (c) adaptability to a sudden reduction in processing resources. Our solution uses a multi-resolution multi-size-windows approach, implemented as a line-independent process, well-suited for GPU implementation. The multi-resolution approach provides adaptability to sudden reduction in processing capabilities, besides computational advantages; the windows-based image processing algorithm guarantees low-memory requirements and local processing.

The founding members are cotton farmers who feel that the future of Arkansas farming lies in sweet potatoes and greens. The farmers opted to form the LLC as a means to expand into processing and other value-added operations, and to directly address the negative reputation associated with cooperatives in the region. Scholars in rural economic development have begun to weigh-in on the merits of entrepreneurship as a development strategy for rural communities. Using the case study approach, this chapter examines the Arkansas Delta Produce Marketing Association, LLC, as an innovative organizational form for newly emerging, small-scale farm enterprises. Specifically, this chapter examines how the association is organized and how its members, as rural entrepreneurs, seek to differentiate their association from earlier organizational failures. Similarly, and perhaps more importantly, a focus will be on barriers to entrepreneurship and issues that are encountered by small-scale farmers as they attempt to transform agricultural production in the Delta, and to contribute to local economic development efforts.									1	0	0	0	0	1					978-1-84844-625-0	WOS:000288157000011

Effects of total surface area and fabric density on the acoustical behavior of traditional thermal-bonded highloft nonwoven fabrics								JOURNAL OF THE TEXTILE INSTITUTE				102	9			746	751		10.1080/00405000.2010.515731			2011	2011	Nonwoven fabrics are ideal materials for use in acoustical insulation products because they have a high total surface area, which is directly related to the denier and cross-sectional shape of the fiber. The smaller the denier, the more fibers for the same material density, the higher the total fiber surface area is. This results in a greater opportunity for interaction between the sound wave and the fibers in the structure. Another important parameter is the density of the nonwoven material, which affects the geometry and the volume of the voids in the structure. The acoustical properties of fabric materials are measured using one of two methods: the impedance tube method and the reverberation room test method. The impedance tube method uses very small test samples (5-15 cm), whereas the reverberation room test method requires large test samples and is expensive to set up. For making comparative analysis of the test samples and overcoming the disadvantages of the current test methods, a direct comparative acoustical properties measurement device has been developed and fabricated in the School of Materials Science and Engineering at Clemson University in an attempt to overcome some of the disadvantages of the other method.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0040-5000			WOS:000294307300002		
J	Goethals, Paul L.; Cho, Byung Rae								Solving the optimal process target problem using response surface designs in heteroscedastic conditions								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH				49	12			3455	3478	PII 923373605	10.1080/00207543.2010.484556			2011	2011	The contemporary industrial environment continues to rely on the identification of the optimal process target as a means to minimise the product defect rate and ultimately reduce manufacturing costs. Within the context of the optimal process target problem, this paper will offer three distinct contributions. First, a review of literature associated with the process target problem indicates that most research work assumes a known process distribution mean and variance prior to the identification of optimal settings. In contrast, this paper will incorporate the use of response surface designs into solving the process target problem, thus removing the need to make assumptions regarding the process parameters. Second, most research regarding the development of response surface designs either assumes that the same number of observations are made on a quality characteristic of interest, or model error always exhibits a uniform pattern of constant variance. This paper, however, will incorporate alternative modelling techniques to investigate instances when these assumptions are not present, thus broadening the scope of the process target problem. Finally, most research in this area focuses on the determination of the optimal process mean; in this paper, however, we propose a model for simultaneously determining the optimal process mean and variance.									11	0	0	0	0	11			0020-7543			WOS:000289246500002

We develop a similarity theory for the new model which shows that it is better equipped than the NS-alpha model to capture smaller-scale behavior. Next, we propose and study an unconditionally stable, optimally accurate, and efficient finite-element implementation for the NS-alpha beta model; rigorous proofs for stability and convergence are provided. Finally, we present results from two numerical experiments that demonstrate the advantages of the NS-alpha beta model over the NS-alpha model. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J	Dean, Brian C.; Griffis, Adam; Parekh, Ojas; Whitley, Adam								Approximation Algorithms for k-hurdle Problems								ALGORITHMICA				59	1			81	93		10.1007/s00453-010-9408-y			JAN 2011	2011	The polynomial-time solvable k-hurdle problem is a natural generalization of the classical s-t minimum cut problem where we must select a minimum-cost subset S of the edges of a graph such that vertical bar p boolean AND S vertical bar >= k for every s-t path p. In this paper, we describe a set of approximation algorithms for "k-hurdle" variants of the NP-hard multiway cut and multicut problems. For the k-hurdle multiway cut problem with r terminals, we give two results, the first being a pseudo-approximation algorithm that outputs a (k - 1)-hurdle solution whose cost is at most that of an optimal solution for k hurdles. Secondly, we provide a 2(1 - 1/r)-approximation algorithm based on rounding the solution of a linear program, for which we give a simple randomized half-integrality proof that works for both edge and vertex k-hurdle multiway cuts that generalizes the half-integrality results of Garg et al. for the vertex multiway cut problem. We also describe an approximation-preserving reduction from vertex cover as evidence that it may be difficult to achieve a better approximation ratio than 2(1 - 1/r). For the k-hurdle multicut problem in an n-vertex graph, we provide an algorithm that, for any constant epsilon > 0, outputs a inverted right perpendicular(1 - epsilon)kinverted left perpendicular-hurdle solution of cost at most O(log n) times that of an optimal k-hurdle solution, and we obtain a 2-approximation algorithm for trees.					8th Latin American Theoretical Informatics International Conference8th Latin American Theoretical Informatics International Conference	APR, 2008APR, 2008		Rio de Janeiro, BRAZILRio de Janeiro, BRAZIL	0	0	0	0	0	0			0178-4617			WOS:000286525300007

The MSTID in question was not very intense and was barely detectable in the vertical F region plasma drifts measured by Arecibo. The intensity of the coherent scatter from small-kale irregularities in the sporadic E layer appeared nonetheless to be modulated by the MSTID and was strongest in the F region, airglow crests, mapped along magnetic field lines to the E region volume being observed. The coherent scatter Doppler shifts were highly correlated with altitude displacements in the sporadic E layer, and the sign of the correlation was controlled by the sign of the background zonal electric field. The MSTID did not appear to modulate the morphology of the sporadic E layer irregularities themselves, which took the form of convective rolls and which drifted with the ambient neutral wind.									2	0	0	0	0	2					978-94-007-0325-4	WOS:000290497500019
