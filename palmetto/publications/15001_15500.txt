J	Kim, Young-Teck; Hong, Young-Shick; Kimmel, Robert A.; Rho, Jeong-Hae; Lee, Cherl-Ho				Kimmel, Robert/C-3755-2013				New approach for characterization of gelatin biopolymer films using proton behavior determined by low field (1)H NMR Spectrometry								JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY				55	26			10678	10684		10.1021/jf071092f			DEC 26 2007	2007	The behavior of protons in biopolymer films (BFs) formed with gelatin, water, and glycerol was investigated at various relative humidities (RHs) and concentrations of glycerol using a low field (1)H NMR spectrometer. At a RH of approximately 0%, the distributed spin-spin relaxation times (T(2)) of protons in BFs showed two components: a rapidly relaxing proton with the shortest T(2) derived from protons in the rigid backbone of the gelatin polymer such as CH(1)-, CH(2)-, and CH(3)-, and a slowly relaxing component with longer T(2) from protons of the functional groups in amino acid residues in gelatin such as -OH, -COOH, and -NH(3). These two components are referred to as nonexchangeable (T(2)N) and exchangeable protons (T(2E)), respectively, indicating the different mobility of the protons. The T2E increased as RH increased indicating the increase in relative mobility of protons due to the larger free volume in the BF matrix. Above a RH of 33%, the slowest relaxing component was found in all BFs and referred to as hydration-water protons (T(2w)) with the highest relative mobility of all protons in the films. It suggests that the free volume in BFs can be formed above a RH of 33% in the absence of glycerol. The behaviors of T(2N), T(2E), and T(2W) reveal the formation of free volume in the BF matrix associated with the presence of plasticizers (water and glycerol). The T(2) behavior in BFs is consistent with the behavior of spin-lattice relaxation (T(1)). Our result is the first attempt to characterize using low field (1)H NMR technology how all protons in a film matrix behave and to develop correlations between proton mobility and free volume in protein-based BFs plasticized with water and glycerol.									11	0	0	3	0	11			0021-8561			WOS:000251768800024	18052122

The electrochemical properties of these compounds were also studied in detail. The synthesis involved oxidative heterocoupling of free base tris-aryl-p-aminophenyl porphyrins with a p-aminophenylacetal, followed by deprotection to give the aldehyde, and finally Prato 1,3-dipolar azomethineylide cycloaddition to C-60. The corresponding Zn(II)-porphyrin (ZnP) dyads were made by treating the free base dyads with zinc acetate. The final dyads were characterized by their H-1 NMR, mass, and UV-vis spectra. He-3 NMR was used to determine if the products are a mixture of cis and trans stereoisomers, or a single isomer. The data are most consistent with the isolation of only a single configurational isomer, assigned to the trans (E) configuration. The ground-state UV-vis spectra are virtually a superimposition of the spectral features of the individual components, indicating there is no interaction of the fullerene (F) and porphyrin (H2P/ZnP) moieties in the ground state. This conclusion is supported by the electrochemical data. The steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectra indicate that the porphyrin fluorescence in the dyads is very strongly quenched at room temperature in the three solvents studied: toluene, tetrahydrofuran (THF), and benzonitrile (BzCN). The fluorescence lifetimes of the dyads in all solvents are sharply reduced compared to those of H2P and ZnP standards. In toluene, the lifetimes of the free base dyads are 600-790 ps compared to 10.1 ns for the standard, while in THF and BzCN the dyad lifetimes are less than 100 ps. For the ZnP dyads, the fluorescence lifetimes were 10-170 ps vs 2.1-2.2 ns for the ZnP references. The mechanism of the fluorescence quenching was established using time-resolved transient absorption spectroscopy. In toluene, the quenching process is singlet-singlet energy transfer (k approximate to 10(11) s(-1)) to give C-60 singlet excited states which decay with a lifetime of 1.2 ns to give very long-lived C60 triplet states. In THF and BzCN, quenching of porphyrin singlet states occurs at a similar rate, but now by electron transfer, to give charge-separated radical pair (CSRP) states, which show transient absorption spectra very similar to those reported for other H2P-C-60 and ZnP-C-60 dyad systems. The lifetimes of the CSRP states are in the range 145-435 ns in THF, much shorter than for related systems with amide, alkyne, silyl, and hydrogen-bonded linkers. Thus, both forward and back electron transfer is facilitated by the azobenzene linker. Nonetheless, the charge recombination is 3-4 orders of magnitude slower than charge separation, demonstrating that for these types of donor-acceptor systems back electron transfer is occurring in the Marcus inverted region.									91	1	2	15	0	91			0002-7863			WOS:000251974000048	18052375

Segmented copolymers (FluoroPLA) exhibit tailored surface properties with reasonably high molecular weights and low polydispersities compared to PLLA alone using standard ring-opening polymerization procedures in the presence of tin catalysts. Low loadings of PFPE content (ca. 1 - 5 wt %) decreases surface energies compared to PLLA from 35 to 38 to 15 - 18 mN/m(2), similar to values reported for poly(tetrafluoroethylene). Ultimate strain studies of FluoroPLA fibers and films have shown a dramatic increase (> 300% elongation) over PLLA. This new class of polymer may further expand the use of renewable resources in a variety of applications such as flame retardants, chemical resistant fibers and/or fabrics with tailorable surface energies and wetting properties.									30	0	0	2	0	30			0024-9297			WOS:000251724700022

The structures of these monomers were confirmed by H-1. F-19, and C-13 NMR spectroscopy and elemental (C, H, and N) combustion analysis. The monomers were readily polymerized via thermal [2 + 2] cyclopolymerization to form chromophore containing PFCB polymers with high molecular weights (Mn = 16 700 - 22 000), superb thermal stability T-d > 450 degrees C, and excellent processability. Photoluminescence studies reveal that the fluorinated ether linkage has no effect on lumiphore emission wavelength or solution quantum yields. Copolymerization affords a facile route to tailored emission from a linear polymeric system that includes a broad range of the visible spectrum. The properties of these polymers were analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and absorbance and photoluminescence spectroscopy.									21	3	0	0	0	24			0024-9297			WOS:000251724700025

The synthesis of POSS aryl trifluorovinyl ether (TFVE) monomers was accomplished by the condensation of commercial monosilanolalkyl-POSS with a TFVE-functionalized chlorosilane. POSS TFVE monomers were elucidated by (1)H, (19)F, (13)C, and (29)Si NMR spectroscopy, ATR-FTIR analysis, and elemental (C, H, and F) combustion analysis. Bulk thermal copolymerization of POSS TFVE monomers afforded random and block PFCB aryl ether copolymers functionalized with various POSS loadings. Quantitative monomer conversion was monitored by 19F NMR, which produced copolymer number-average molecular weights (M(n)) of (19.5-24.9) x 10(3) (in CHCl(3) using polystyrene as standard) determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Thermal properties of POSS PFCB aryl ether copolymers were evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). Transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis of spin cast optically transparent, flexible POSS PFCB aryl ether copolymer films revealed the presence of 5-20 nm-sized POSS agglomerates. Optical profilometer analysis of spin and drop cast film surfaces exhibited a modest increase in surface roughness of POSS PFCB aryl ether copolymers as compared to PFCB aryl ether homopolymers without POSS inclusion. The POSS copolymers exhibited a modest increase in hydrophobicity as measured by static water contact angle analysis. Synthesis, characterization, thermal analysis, and unique surface features of POSS PFCB aryl ether copolymers are discussed.									48	1	0	1	0	48			0024-9297			WOS:000251724700044

These compounds could be separately saponified followed by decarboxylation to the targeted NH-dihydrobenzindazoles. Single-crystal X-ray analysis for several compounds indicated that a single tautomer was present, with the NH-hydrogen atom bonded exclusively to the N-2 of the products. Theoretical calculations indicated this product to be the more stable of the two tautomers.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0888-5885			WOS:000251583100019

In the current work, tunable and sustained release of a model protein, hexa-histidine tagged green fluorescence protein (hisGFP), is accomplished by judiciously increasing ligand:protein ratio or replacing low-affinity nickel ions with high-affinity copper ions. Agreement between theoretical predictions of a reaction-diffusion model and experimental measurements confirm metalion-mediated sustained protein release from these affinity hydrogels is governed by equilibrium protein-ligand binding affinity (dissociation constant, K-d) as well as protein-ligand dissociation kinetics (protein debinding rate constant, k(off)). The former dictates the release rate in the early period of protein release while the latter determines the long-term sustained release effect. While metal-ion affinity binding has been widely used for various purposes including protein purification and surface patterrning, this is the first report describing its application in systematically controlling protein release from hydrophilic PEG networks suitable for cell encapsulation. By using ligands with proper binding kinetic constants (K-d and k(off)), localized protein delivery can be sustained over clinically relevant timescales while maintaining a favorable environment for cell encapsulation and viability.

Analysis of the hydromechanical behavior of a flat-lying fracture during a slug test								JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY				347	1-2			35	47		10.1016/j.jhydrot.2007.08.020			DEC 15 2007	2007	Slug tests dilate and contract fractures in aquifers. We developed a coupled hydromechanical analysis of an idealized fracture to evaluate effects of these deformations in fractured crystalline rock aquifers. The analysis shows the abrupt increase in pressure at the beginning of a slug test causes a slight opening of a fracture, but the fracture continues to open as the pressure falls in the wellbore. This happens because the pressure increases over an ever-widening area even though it decreases in the wellbore. Eventually decreasing pressure in the vicinity of the wellbore offsets the spreading pressure and the fracture starts to close, ultimately returning to its initial aperture when the pressure equilibrates. The displacement in the wellbore when the pressure head is rising is always smaller than when the head is falling, and this produces a loop-like, hysteresis when displacement is plotted as a function of pressure. A sensitivity analysis shows the displacement at the wellbore is sensitive to the magnitude and distribution of aquifer properties, suggesting that the displacement signal could be combined with pressure measurements to improve the interpretation of slug tests during aquifer characterization.

These include CdSb(2)Se(3)Br, 1 and its isoelectronic indium derivatives InSb(2)S(4)X (X = Cl 2 and Br 3) and InM(2)Se(4)Br (M = Sb 4 and Bi 5). Single crystals were grown from direct interaction of stoichiometric mixtures of respective elemental and binary compounds. The parent compound cadmium antimony selenobromide, CdSb(2)Se(3)Br(2), was synthesized by heating the stoichiometric mixture of CdBr(2) and Sb and Se at 450 degrees C followed by slow cooling. Single-crystal structure analysis was carried out by employing X-ray diffraction methods, showing that this compound crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system (C2/m, No. 12) with a = 20.998(4) angstrom, b = 4.0260(8) angstrom, c = 12.149(2) angstrom, beta = 119.00(3)degrees. and V = 898.3(3) angstrom(3). The frainework exhibits mixed CdBr(2) and Sb(2)Se(3) sublattices, respectively, adopting the (110) and (100) NaCl-type structures. The former consists of dual octahedral chains of Cd-centered [CdBr(5)Se] units sharing cis Br edges, and the chains propagate along the b axis via sharing trans Br edoes of the octahedra. The Sb(2)Se(3) sublattice is made of three edge-shared [SbSe(5)] square-pyramidal units, features commonly seen in antimony and Sb-containing selenides. The apex selenium atoms of the aforementioned [CdBr(5)Se] unit are corner-shared with [SbSe(5)] sublattices to form a composite slab along the (-101) plane. The lone-pair electrons of Sb(3+) cations point into the space between the stacked slabs. The indium derivatives 2-5 were synthesized by substituting the trivalent In(3+) for divalent Cd(2+) cations, along with a stoichiometric amount of charge-compensating halide anions. These four new In derivatives are isostructural with 1 and can be formulated as (InSX)(Sb(2)S(3)) (X = Cl and Br), and (InSeBr)(MSe(3)) (M = Sb and Bi) with respect to the composite lattices of CdBr(2) and Sb(2)Se(3). The UV-vis reflectance spectroscopy and band structure calculations confirm that these compounds are semiconductors with steep band (lap absorption edges around 1.1-1.8 eV. In light of the observed blue shift in the absorption edge with respect to the dimensionally reduced post-transition-metal chalcogenide M(2)Q(3) sublattices, we claim quantum confinement effect of the optical band gap, which is the first example among inorganic mixed-anion compounds reported thus far.									14	0	0	1	0	14			0897-4756			WOS:000251422000026

The specimen from the effected organ tissues were examined by using transmission electron microscopy, aimed toward an understanding of the possible uptake mechanism. The biological consequence of pristine SWNTs is obviously very different from that of their chemically modified or functionalized counterparts.

We have determined the impact of the progressive replacement of S by Se on the nonlinear properties of these glasses. The value of n(2) strongly increases with the substitution of S by Se, up to 350 times the n(2) for fused silica. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicates that the increase of Ge-Se bond units in the glass network is responsible for the increase of n(2). The suitability of these glasses for optical switching at telecommunication wavelengths based on such nonlinear properties has been also confirmed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We conclude that all these properties are consistent with the binary compact merger hypothesis for the progenitor of GRB 050813.									14	0	0	0	0	14			0004-6256	1538-3881		WOS:000251237600003		
J	Bubar, Eric J.; King, Jeremy R.; Soderblom, David R.; Deliyannis, Constantine P.; Boesgaard, Ann M.								Keck HIRES spectroscopy of candidate post-T Tauri stars								ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL				134	6			2328	2339		10.1086/522626			DEC 2007	2007	We use high signal-to-noise ratio (similar to 150-450), high-resolution (R similar to 45,000) Keck HIRES spectroscopy of 13 candidate post-T Tauri stars (PTTs) to derive basic physical parameters, lithium abundances, and radial velocities. We place our stars in the M-v-T-eff plane for use in determining approximate ages from pre-main-sequence isochrones, and we confirm these using three relative age indicators in our analysis: Li abundances, chromospheric emission, and the kinematic U-V plane. Using the three age criteria we identify five stars ( HIP 54529, HIP 62758, HIP 63322, HIP 74045, and HIP 104864) as probable PTTs with ages between 10 and 100 Myr. We confirm HIP 54529 as an SB2 star and HIP 63322 as an SB1 star. We also examine irregular photometric variability of PTTs using the Hipparcos photometry annex. Two of our PTTs exhibit near-IR excesses compared to Kurucz model flux; while recent work suggests classical T Tauri stars evince similar JHK excesses presumably indicative of nonphotospheric ( disk) emission, our results may be illusory artifacts of the chosen I-band normalization. The near-IR excesses we see in a literature-based sample of PTTs appear to be artifacts of previous spectral type-based T-eff values. Indeed, comparison of the homology of their observed and model photospheric spectral energy distributions suggests that photometric temperatures are more reliable than temperatures based on spectral standards for the cooler temperature ranges of the stars in this sample. We conclude that our age-oriented analysis is a robust means to select samples of nearby, young, isolated PTTs that otherwise masquerade as normal field stars.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0004-6256			WOS:000251237600018

The process optimization was carried out to fabricate both PCL and PCL-HA (25% concentration by weight of HA) with a controlled pore size and internal pore structure of the 0 degrees/90 degrees pattern. Two groups of scaffolds having 60% and 70% porosity and with pore sizes of 450 and 750 mu m, respectively, were evaluated for their morphology and compressive properties using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and mechanical testing. Our results suggested that inclusion of HA significantly increased the compressive modulus from 59 to 84 MPa for 60% porous scaffolds and from 30 to 76 MPa for 70% porous scaffolds. In vitro cell-scaffolds interaction study was carried out using primary fetal bovine osteoblasts to assess the feasibility of scaffolds for bone tissue-engineering application. The cell proliferation and differentiation were calculated by Alamar Blue assay and by determining alkaline phosphatase activity. The osteoblasts were able to migrate and proliferate over the cultured time for both PCL as well as PCL-HA scaffolds. Our study demonstrated the viability of the PED process to the fabricate PCL and PCL-HA composite scaffolds having necessary mechanical property, structural integrity, controlled pore size and pore interconnectivity desired for bone tissue engineering.

Expression of two recombinant chloramphenicol acetyltransf erase variants in highly reduced genome Escherichia coli strains								BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOENGINEERING				98	5			1056	1070		10.1002/bit.21491			DEC 1 2007	2007	Highly reduced E. coli strains, MDS40, MDS4 1, and MDS42, lacking approximately 15% of the genome, were grown to high cell densities to test their ability to produce a recombinant protein with high yields. These strains lack all transposons and insertion sequences, cryptic prophage and many genes of unknown function. In addition to improving genetic stability, these deletions may reduce the biosynthetic requirements of the cell potentially allowing more efficient production of recombinant protein. Basic growth parameters and the ability of the strains to produce chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) under high cell density, batch cultivation were assessed. Although growth rate and recombinant protein production of the reduced genome strains are comparable to the parental MG1655 strain, the reduced genome strains were found to accumulate significant amounts of acetate in the medium at the expense of additional biomass. A number of hypotheses were examined to explain the accumulation of acetate, including oxygen limitation, carbon flux imbalance, and metabolic activity of the recombinant protein. Use of a non-catalytic CAT variant identified the recombinant protein activity as the source of this phenomenon; implications for the metabolic efficiency of the reduced genome strains are discussed.									13	1	0	10	0	14			0006-3592			WOS:000250741300012	17497738

Analysis of high-pressure hydrogen, methane, and heptane laminar diffusion flames: Thermal diffusion factor modeling								COMBUSTION AND FLAME				151	4			581	600		10.1016/j.combustflame.2007.06.007			DEC 2007	2007	Direct numerical simulations are conducted for one-dimensional laminar diffusion flames over a large range of pressures (I <= P-0 <= 200 atm) employing a detailed multicomponent transport model applicable to dense fluids. Reaction kinetics mechanisms including pressure dependencies and prior validations at both low and high pressures were selected and include a detailed 24-step, 12-species hydrogen mechanism (H-2/O-2 and 142/air), and reduced mechanisms for methane (CH4/air: 11 steps, 15 species) and heptane (C7H16/air: 13 steps, 17 species), all including thermal NOx chemistry. The governing equations are the fully compressible Navier-Stokes equations, coupled with the Peng-Robinson real fluid equation of state. A generalized multicomponent diffusion model derived from nonequilibrium thermodynamics and fluctuation theory is employed and includes both heat and mass transport in the presence of concentration, temperature, and pressure gradients (i.e., Dufour and Soret diffusion). Previously tested high-pressure mixture property models are employed for the viscosity, heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and mass diffusivities. Five models for high-pressure thermal diffusion coefficients related to Soret and Dufour cross-diffusion are first compared with experimental data over a wide range of pressures. Laminar flame simulations are then conducted for each of the four flames over a large range of pressures for all thermal diffusion coefficient models and results are compared with purely Fickian and Fourier diffusion simulations. The results reveal a considerable range in the influence of cross-diffusion predicted by the various models; however, the most plausible models show significant cross-diffusion effects, including reductions in the peak flame temperatures and minor species concentrations for all flames. These effects increase with pressure for both H-2 flames and for the C7H16 flames indicating the elevated importance of proper cross-diffusion modeling at large pressures. Cross-diffusion effects, while not negligible, were observed to be less significant in the CH4 flames and to decrease with pressure. Deficiencies in the existing thermal diffusion coefficient models are discussed and future research directions suggested. (c) 2007 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In this paper we summarize an extensive body of work examining the adaptive responses of Fundulus species to environmental conditions, and describe how this research has contributed importantly to our understanding of physiology, gene regulation, toxicology, and ecological and evolutionary genetics of teleosts and other vertebrates. These explorations have reached a critical juncture at which advancement is hindered by the lack of genomic resources for these species. We suggest that a more complete genomics toolbox for F heteroclitus and related species will permit researchers to exploit the power of this model organism to rapidly advance our understanding of fundamental biological and pathological mechanisms among vertebrates, as well as ecological strategies and evolutionary processes common to all living organisms.

Framework for developing a static strength test for measuring deformation resistance of asphalt concrete mixtures								CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS				21	12			2047	2058		10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2006.06.032			DEC 2007	2007	This study deals with a strength property which is showing high correlation with rutting resistance of asphalt mixtures. The test procedure was developed by applying a load to the compacted asphalt samples and calculating the strength by using the deformation of the mixture at the failure point. To evaluate the validity of this test, various mixtures were prepared with two aggregates and seven binders using four loading head types at the loading speed of 50.8 mm/min at 60 degrees C. Maximum load and deformation were recorded for each test and deformation strength, SE), was calculated using a newly developed equation. For the same mixture, wheel tracking test was performed and two rut parameters, depth of rut and dynamic stability were obtained. The relationship between S-D and rut parameters was evaluated using regression analyses. In most cases, R-2 values were found to be over 0.9. This test procedure is still under development; however, current results indicate that it might be a simple test to predict the deformation resistance of asphalt mixtures at high temperatures.

J	Klein, Richard								An empirical examination of patient-physician portal acceptance								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS				16	6			751	760		10.1057/palgrave.ejis.3000719			DEC 2007	2007	Healthcare providers have recently begun deploying Internet- based patient physician portals. These applications allow patients to both communicate with their providers and access personal medical information, such as laboratory results. Research within medical informatics explores, and debates, the utility of such functions from the patient and physician perspectives. However, work does not examine factors influencing patient use, assuming that once built and deployed patients will come. Hence, the current research empirically investigates patient behavioral intentions ( BI) with respect to ( a) use of electronic communications functions and ( b) accessing of individual medical information through an Internet- based patient - physician portal. Surveying 294 patients, this work incorporates individual factors, namely computer self-efficacy and personal innovativeness in the domain of information technology, with technology- based factors identified in the Technology Acceptance Model. The analysis finds that usefulness and innovativeness have a positive direct effect on BI with respect to both functions, namely communications and information access. Additionally, patients with greater healthcare needs foresee increased use of portals to access their personal medical information. Finally, patients in primary care, as opposed to specialist, provider settings intend to engage in electronic communications.									34	0	0	1	0	34			0960-085X			WOS:000251949600009

Accelerating networks: Effects of preferential connections								EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B				60	4			521	528		10.1140/epjb/e2008-00014-4			DEC 2007	2007	Networks are commonly observed structures in complex systems with interacting and interdependent parts that self-organize. For nonlinearly growing networks, when the total number of connections increases faster than the total number of nodes, the network is said to accelerate. We propose a systematic model for the dynamics of growing networks represented by distribution kinetics equations. We define the nodal-linkage distribution, construct a population dynamics equation based on the association-dissociation process, and perform the moment calculations to describe the dynamics of such networks. For nondirectional networks with finite numbers of nodes and connections, the moments are the total number of nodes, the total number of connections, and the degree (the average number of connections per node), represented by the average moment. Size independent rate coefficients yield an exponential network describing the network without preferential attachment, and size dependent rate coefficients produce a power law network with preferential attachment. The model quantitatively describes accelerating network growth data for a supercomputer (Earth Simulator), for regulatory gene networks, and for the Internet.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1434-6028			WOS:000252421200015

Several operational scenarios were duplicated and the fire critical conditions were identified. This study also provided new information about the welding spatters size, speed, splash angle and distribution. The findings from current work might lead to effective fire mitigation strategies for industrial welding ventilation systems containing cellulose filters.									1	1	0	0	0	2			0015-2684			WOS:000250630800004

Progeny fitness of the mealybug parasitoid Anagyrus sp nov nr. sinope (Hymenoptera : Encyrtidae) as affected by brood size, sex ratio, and host quality								FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST				90	4			656	664		10.1653/0015-4040(2007)90[656:PFOTMP]2.0.CO;2			DEC 2007	2007	Anagyrus sp. nov. nr. sinope Noyes & Menezes (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) is a gregarious, koinobiont parasitoid of the Madeira mealybug, Phenacoccus madeirensis Green (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae). We investigated effects of larval competition on development, survival, and progeny body size of the parasitoid over a range of brood sizes and sex ratios. We recorded the brood size, sex ratio, and fitness parameters of parasitoids developing from second instars and adult R madeirensis. Adult mealybugs as hosts produce larger brood and progeny body sizes and more female progeny. Second instar R madeirensis continued to develop after parasitism, and mummies achieved a more advanced developmental stage yielding parasitoid cohorts of larger brood and body sizes, female-biased sex ratio, and longer developmental time than mummies formed from younger host instars. Overall, the sexual composition within a brood had little or no effect on the development, survival and body size of the parasitoid progeny developing from second instar and adult mealybugs. Larval competition among brood-mates developing in adult mealybugs caused a reduction in the progeny tibial length with increasing brood sizes. In contrast, parasitoids developing from second instar mealybugs had a longer developmental time and little (although positive) or no response in the progeny tibial length to increasing brood size. We hypothesize that the continuous development of second instar mealybugs allows the hosts to accumulate additional resources, thus, reducing competition among parasitoid brood mates for limited resources. The continuous development of hosts of younger developmental stages after parasitism may have the potential to alter the direction and intensity of larval competition of the koinobiont gregarious parasitoid.									8	0	0	8	0	8			0015-4040			WOS:000251916200009

In particular, supercritical toluene extraction conditions were identified for producing pitch fractions that, upon solvent removal, consist of 100% liquid crystalline mesophase (e.g., 330 degrees C, 100 bar, and a toluene-to-pitch ratio of 3:1). Temperature versus composition diagrams generated using SAFT-LC illustrate the effect of both temperature, pitch composition, and solvent addition on phase transitions from liquid crystalline to isotropic phase behavior. MALDI mass spectrometry was used to facilitate the selection of physically meaningful pseudocomponents for modeling the feed pitch.

Potential sources of resistance to broad mites (Polyphagotarsonemus latus) in watermelon germplasm								HORTSCIENCE				42	7			1539	1544					DEC 2007	2007	Two hundred nineteen U.S. plant introductions (PI) belonging to the watermelon core collection were evaluated for broad mite, Polyphagotarsonemus latus (Banks), infestation and injury that occurred naturally in a field planting. Of the 219 PIs, nine (4%) had no visible broad mite injury in the field compared with a commercial cultivar, 'Mickey Lee', which was severely injured. Injury mainly occurred on the growing terminals and the tender apical leaves. The growing terminals and the apical leaves were bronzed, grew poorly and, in some cases, they were distorted and curled upward. Broad mites were extracted by washing the growing terminals of 22 selected PIs with boiling water and counting the mites under a stereomicroscope. 'Mickey Lee' had more broad mites on growing terminals compared with some of the PIs with no visible injury. Fourteen selected PIs were further evaluated in the greenhouse to confirm their resistance by artificially infesting them with broad mites that had been cultured on susceptible watermelon plants. PIs in accessions belonging to Citrullus lanatus var. lanatus (PI 357708), Citrullus lanatus var. citroides (PI 500354), Citrullus colocynthis (PI 386015, PI 386016, PI 525082), and Parecitrullus fistulosus (PI 449332) bad significantly lower broad mite injury ratings and counts compared with 'Mickey Lee' and other susceptible PIs. Broad mites have not been reported on watermelons in the United States before; however, it can emerge as a serious pest. The previously mentioned accessions can serve as potential sources of broad mite resistance for use in breeding programs aimed at enhancing pest resistance in watermelon.									10	1	0	8	1	12			0018-5345			WOS:000251115900007

Klaine, Stephen/C-5352-2011				Nutrient recovery by seven aquatic garden plants in a laboratory-scale subsurface-constructed wetland								HORTSCIENCE				42	7			1674	1680					DEC 2007	2007	Commercial nurseries use large amounts of water and nutrients to produce container-grown plants. The large volume of runoff containing nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) that leaves nurseries can contaminate surface and groundwater. Subsurface flow-constructed wetlands have been shown to effectively treat agricultural, industrial, and residential wastewater and to be well-suited for growers with limited production space. We investigated the possibility of using commercially available aquatic garden plants in subsurface-constructed wetlands to remove nutrients in a laboratory scale, gravel-based system. Seven popular aquatic garden plants received N and P from Hoagland's nutrient solution every 2 days for 8 weeks. These rates (0.39 to 36.81 mg.L-1 of N and 0.07 to 6.77 mg.L-1 P, respectively) encompassed low to high rates of nutrients found at various points between the discharge and inflow points of other constructed wetland systems currently in use at commercial nurseries. Plant biomass, nutrient recovery, and tissue nutrient concentration and content were measured. Whole plant dry weight positively correlated with total N and P supplied. Louisiana Iris hybrid 'Full Eclipse', Canna x generalis Bailey (pro sp.) 'Bengal Tiger', Canna x generalis Bailey (pro sp.) 'Yellow King Humbert', Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott 'Illustris', Peltandra virginica (L.) Schott, and Pontederia cordata L. 'Singapore Pink' had the greatest N recovery rates. The P recovery rates were similar for the cannas, Colocasia esculenta 'Illustris', Louisiana Iris 'Full Eclipse', Pe. virginica, and Po. cordata 'Singapore Pink'. The potential exists for creating a sustainable nursery and greenhouse production system that incorporates a subsurface-constructed wetland planted with marketable horticultural crops that provide remediation and revenue.									8	0	0	7	0	8			0018-5345			WOS:000251115900035

Detailed vertical profiles of groundwater levels and solute concentrations were obtained over a 4.5-year period. Vertical migration occurred at several time scales, as a low concentration front was rapidly transported at rates of 100-500 m/year ahead of a slower moving main plume, which advanced at rates of 0.2-0.8 m/year. Concentrations in the leading edge of the plume displayed a high degree of spatial variability over short vertical distances through day 1,000. Late in the test, the influence of matrix diffusion became apparent as concentration patterns developed from being irregular to more uniform distributions. Calculations show that the mass within the low concentration plume front accounts for less than 1% of the total solute mass. Simulation of the breakthrough curves using a simple one-dimensional advection-dispersion model of transport in porous media indicates that vertical transport is dominated by advection. Furthermore, the results indicate that vertical transport of solutes in oxidized and reduced zones of the till can be adequately simulated using an equivalent porous media.									18	1	0	8	0	19			1431-2174			WOS:000251144400003		
J	GurJar, Nliheer; Jalili, Nader								Toward ultrasmall mass detection using adaptive self-sensing piezoelectrically driven microcantilevers								IEEE-ASME TRANSACTIONS ON MECHATRONICS				12	6			680	688		10.1109/TMECH.2007.911635			DEC 2007	2007	Over the past decade, microcantilever-based mass sensing has grown to become a significant field of research in the engineering community. The ability of micirocantilevers to detect extremely small biochemical particles is being investigated for a number of industrial applications. This paper presents an adaptive self-sensing strategy for ultrasmall tip mass estimation using piezoelectrically actuated microcantilevers. A piezoelectric patch actuator deposited on the cantilever surface actuates the beam through a capacitance bridge mechanism. The same patch is used to measure shifts in the beam natural frequency associated with increase in the mass, which is due to the addition of biochemical particles. The ability to measure frequency shifts due to tip masses as small as 1 fg (10(-15) g) is demonstrated through extensive numerical simulations. Uncertainty in the measurement of system parameters makes implementation of the self-sensing bridge network difficult at the microscale. The piezoelectric capacitance is also known to vary with temperature. To overcome these difficulties, a novel adaptive mechanism is presented to dynamically balance the capacitance bridge network. Lyapunov-based stability analysis demonstrates the global stability of the adaptation laws. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of this mechanism to perform self-sensing at the microscale. Experimental validation of the adaptation mechanism at the microscale involves a number of technical challenges, and hence, is performed on a macroscale cantilever system. This paper aims to motivate research in the development of a powerful, yet portable frequency shift detection-based microcantilever sensor for use in a variety of biochemical applications, where ultrasmall mass detection is a key requirement.									23	0	0	0	0	23			1083-4435			WOS:000251840800011

This note extends previous methods developed to compensate bias in angular rate measurements by accounting for a more general class of disturbances, and by allowing uncertainty in the inertial parameters. By resorting to adaptive observers designed on the basis of the internal model principle, it is shown how converging estimates of the angular velocity can be used effectively in a passivity-based controller yielding global convergence within the chosen parametrization of the group of rotations. Since a persistence of excitation condition is not required for the convergence of the state estimates, only an upper bound on the number of distinct harmonic components of the disturbance is needed for the applicability of the method.									15	1	0	0	0	15			0018-9286			WOS:000251746000020		
J	Braganza, David; Dawson, Darren M.; Walker, Ian D.; Nath, Nitendra								A neural network controller for continuum robots								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ROBOTICS				23	6			1270	1277		10.1109/TRO.2007.906248			DEC 2007	2007	Continuum or hyper-redundant robot manipulators can exhibit behavior similar to biological trunks, tentacles, or snakes. Unlike traditional rigid-link robot manipulators, continuum robot manipulators do not have rigid joints, hence these manipulators are extremely dexterous, compliant, and are capable of dynamic adaptive manipulation in unstructured environments. However, the development of high-performance control algorithms for these manipulators is quite a challenge, due to their unique design and the high degree of uncertainty in their dynamic models. In this paper, a controller for continuum robots, which utilizes a neural network feedforward component to compensate for dynamic uncertainties is presented. Experimental results using the OCTARM, which is a soft extensible continuum manipulator, are provided to illustrate that the addition of the neural network feedforward component to the controller provides improved performance.									35	1	0	1	0	36			1552-3098	1941-0468		WOS:000251944100018

Schultz-Bip], Echinacea purpurea (L.) Moench, Echinacea pallida (Nutt.) Nutt., Valeriana officinalis L., and St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L.) during 1998-2001. In addition, arthropods were sampled on tansy (Tanacetum vulgare L.) from 2001-2004. In general, 50-60 arthropod species where collected and identified among all of the medicinal plant species. Among the predators, Orius insidiosus (Say) (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae), Geocoris punctipes (Say) (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae) and spiders were most abundant from 1998-2004. The three-cornered alfalfa hopper, Spissistilus festinus (Say), was the most abundant herbivore found from 1998 to 2001. Orius insidiosus and G. punctipes were 3-4 times more abundant on T parthenium than on any other medicinal plant species. Based on the numbers of predatory arthropods found on T parthenium, this crop could be suitable as a companion or "banker" plant to attract and maintain populations of predators, especially O. insidiosus and G. punctipes. Whitefly nymphs attacked by predators with piercing/sucking mouthparts are easily identified using a microscope because of the general appearance of the carcass left by the predators. Thus, populations of predators on T parthenium suppressed Bemisia tabaci populations on E. purpurea when these crops were planted as companion crops.									3	0	0	3	0	3			1672-9609	1744-7917		WOS:000251546600010

CBN tool wear in hard turning: a survey on research progresses								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY				35	5-6			443	453		10.1007/s00170-006-0737-6			DEC 2007	2007	Direct machining steel parts at a hardened state, known as hard turning, offers a number of potential benefits over traditional grinding in some applications. In addition, hard turning has several unique process characteristics, e.g., segmented chip formation and microstructural alterations at the machined surfaces, fundamentally different from conventional turning. Hard turning is, therefore, of a great interest to both the manufacturing industry and research community. Development of superhard materials such as polycrystalline cubic boron nitride (known as CBN) has been a key to enabling hard turning technology. A significant pool of CBN tool wear studies has been surveyed, in an attempt to achieve better processing and tooling applications, and discussed from the tool wear pattern and mechanism perspectives. Although various tool wear mechanisms, or a combination of several, coexist and dominate in CBN turning of hardened steels, it has been suggested that abrasion, adhesion (possibly complicated by tribochemical interactions), and diffusion may primarily govern the CBN tool wear in hard turning. Further, wear rate modeling including one approach developed in a recent study, on both crater and flank wear, is discussed as well. In conclusion, a summary of the CBN tool wear survey and the future work are outlined.									46	0	0	0	1	46			0268-3768	1433-3015		WOS:000250836200003		
J	Kundrotas, Petras; Alexov, Emil								Predicting interacting and interfacial residues using continuous sequence segments								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES				41	5			615	623		10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2007.08.002			DEC 1 2007	2007	Development of sequence-based methods for predicting putative interfacial residues is an extremely important task in modeling 3D structures of protein-protein complexes. In the present paper we used non-gapped sequence segments to predict both interacting and interfacial residues. We demonstrated that continuous sequence segments do occur at the protein-protein interfaces and showed that continuous interacting interfacial segments (CIIS) of length nine are presented on average, in similar to 37% of the complexes in our dataset. Our results indicate that CIIS consist mostly of interacting strands and/or loops, while the CIIS involving the helixes are scarce. We performed scoring of CIIS using four different scoring mechanisms and found that scores of CIIS differ significantly from the scores calculated for random stretches of residues. We argue that such statistical difference inferred thought the corresponding Z-scores could be used for detecting putative interfacial residue segments without using any structural information. This hypothesis was tested on our dataset and benchmarking resulted to 10-60% prediction accuracy depending on type of benchmarking and scoring scheme used in calculations. Such predictions that do not depend on the availability of the 3D structures of monomers can be quite valuable in modeling 3D structures of obligatory complexes, for which structures of separated monomers do not exist.

J	Su, Xinguo; Duan, Jun; Jiang, Yueming; Duan, Xuewu; Chen, Feng								Polyphenolic profile and antioxidant activities of oolong tea infusion under various steeping conditions								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES				8	12			1196	1205		10.3390/i8121196			DEC 2007	2007	The phenolic profile and antioxidant activities of oolong tea extract were investigated after tea was steeped in 90 or 100 degrees C water for 3 or 10 min. The extraction yield increased with increasing temperature and extended steeping time. However, higher temperature and longer time (100 degrees C water for 10 min) led to loss of phenolics. The aqueous extract of oolong tea (AEOT) at 100 degrees C for 3 min exhibited the strongest antioxidant activity. The major polyphenolic components of the AEOT were identified as (-)- epigallocatechin (EGC), (-)- epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG). The two major catechins (EGC and EGCG) in the tea infusion contributed significantly to the investigated antioxidant activities [i.e., the 2,2-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl hydrate (DPPH) radical scavenging and superoxide radical scavenging activities] with high correlation values in r = 0.9486 and 0.9327 for the EGC and r = 0.9592 and 0.8718 for the EGCG, respectively.									8	0	0	7	0	9			1422-0067			WOS:000252712200001		
J	Schmalz, Dorothy L.; Deane, Glenn D.; Birch, Leann L.; Davison, Kirsten Krahnstoever								A longitudinal assessment of the links between physical activity and self-esteem in early adolescent non-hispanic females								JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT HEALTH				41	6			559	565		10.1016/j.jadohealth.2007.07.001			DEC 2007	2007	Purpose: For decades, researchers have proclaimed the positive psychosocial benefits of participation in physical activity. However, recent meta-analyses of the literature have found infrequent and inconclusive empirical support for the link between physical activity and psychosocial wellbeing. In this study, we use data from a longitudinal study to explore the links between participation in physical activity and global self-esteem among girls from childhood into early adolescence and the direction of this relationship.Methods: Participants included 197 non-Hispanic white girls. Girls' participation in physical activity and their global self-esteem were assessed when they were 9, 11, and 13 years old. Panel regression was used to assess the lagged effect of physical activity on self-esteem and the lagged effect of self-esteem on physical activity, controlling for family socioeconomic status (SES) and girls' body mass index (BMI).Results: A significant lagged effect of physical activity on self-esteem was identified. Specifically, higher physical activity at ages 9 and 11 years predicted higher self-esteem at ages 11 and 13 years respectively, controlling for covariates. Positive effects of physical activity on self-esteem were most apparent at age 11 and for girls with higher BMI. No support was gained for the lagged effect of self-esteem on physical activity.Conclusions: Results suggest that participating in physical activity can lead to positive self-esteem among adolescent girls, particularly for younger girls and those at greatest risk of overweight. These findings highlight the necessity of promoting physical activity among adolescent girls as a method of fostering positive self-worth. (c) 2007 Society for Adolescent Medicine.

A total of 148 middle and high school students were interviewed during focus groups held at two middle and two high schools in a public school district. The focus groups were approximately 45 minutes in length. Students were divided by gender and asked a series of scripted questions by a same-gender student assistance counselor. We found that students' comments during the focus groups suggest that students-particularly females-view cyber bullying as a problem, but one rarely discussed at school, and that students do not see the school district personnel as helpful resources when dealing with cyber bullying. Students are currently experiencing the majority of cyber bullying instances outside of the school day; however there is some impact at school. Students were able to suggest some basic strategies for dealing with cyber bullying, but were less likely to be aware of strategies to request the removal of objectionable websites, as well as how to respond as a helpful bystander when witnessing cruel online behavior. We conclude that school districts should address cyber bullying through a combination of policies and information that are shared with students and parents. Schools should include cyber bullying as part of their bullying prevention strategies and include classroom lessons that address reporting and bystander behavior.

J	Kowalski, Robin M.; Limber, Susan P.								Electronic bullying among middle school students								JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT HEALTH				41	6			S22	S30		10.1016/j.jadohealth.2007.08.017		S	DEC 2007	2007	Purpose: Electronic communications technologies are affording children and adolescents new means of bullying one another. Referred to as electronic bullying, cyberbullying, or online social cruelty, this phenomenon includes bullying through e-mail, instant messaging, in a chat room, on a website, or through digital messages or images sent to a cell phone. The present study examined the prevalence of electronic bullying among middle school students. Methods: A total of 3,767 middle school students in grades 6, 7, and 8 who attend six elementary and middle schools in the southeastern and northwestern United States completed a questionnaire, consisting of the Olweus Bully/Victim Questionnaire and 23 questions developed for this study that examined participants' experiences with electronic bullying, as both victims and perpetrators. Results: Of the students, 11% that they had been electronically bullied at least once in the last couple of months (victims only); 7% indicated that they were bully/victims; and 4% had electronically bullied someone else at least once in the previous couple of months (bullies only). The most common methods for electronic bullying (as reported by both victims and perpetrators) involved the use of instant messaging, chat rooms, and e-mail. Importantly, close to half of the electronic bully victims reported not knowing the perpetrator's identity. Conclusions: Electronic bullying represents a problem of significant magnitude. As children's use of electronic communications technologies is unlikely to wane in coming years, continued attention to electronic bullying is critical. Implications of these findings for youth, parents, and educators are discussed. (D 2007 Society for Adolescent Medicine.

Differential effects of heat stress in three strains of laying hens								JOURNAL OF APPLIED POULTRY RESEARCH				16	4			628	634		10.3382/japr.2005-00088			WIN 2007	2007	Hy-Line Brown, W36, and W98 hens were housed for 2 wk at 22 degrees C, exposed to 35 C heat stress (HS) for 2 wk, and had 2 wk of recovery at 22 C. Production parameters ( egg production, feed intake, egg quality measures, and mortality), acid-base status ( pH, pCO(2), HCO3-, pO(2)), intestinal calcium uptake, and expression of hepatic heat shock protein-70 were measured. All production parameters except mortality were reduced by HS in all 3 strains. There were strain x temperature interactions for egg production, feed intake, shell thickness, specific gravity, and yolk weight, with the least severe reduction in W98 hens. The W36 hens were intermediate for egg production and feed intake, and the Brown and W36 hens were equivalent for shell thickness, specific gravity, and yolk weight. There were no interactions for egg, albumen, and shell weights, Haugh units, and intestinal calcium uptake, and all were reduced by HS. Blood pH and pCO2 were reduced by HS, and hepatic heat shock protein-70 was increased, with no differences among strains. Mortality rates during HS were 16, 8, and 4% for the Brown, W98, and W36 hens, respectively, but were not subjected to statistical analysis. The results suggest a mechanism in the W98 bird that appears to confer an advantage during HS with regard to egg production.									31	1	2	26	3	34			1056-6171			WOS:000252810900020

Both developments can be explained as a result of learning by doing among British commanders. This learning was importantly driven by the extensive wartime experience accumulated over this period, combined with the unparalleled financial incentives for combat success offered to British commanders.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0022-0507			WOS:000251918700006

In a 2 x 2 factorial design, the authors gave all of the students matrices containing representational pictures for each pair of words, as well as examples of each word in use. One factor in the design was the absence or presence of rules of usage for each pair, which did or did not prompt rule construction, and the other factor was audio or text presentation of the examples or rules + examples, which could affect cognitive load. Results were consistent with the construction hypothesis and previous research. Students in rule-absent conditions (a) generated more novel examples of the words in use and (b) explained the rules of usage better on written tests than did students in rule-present conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-0973			WOS:000243444400004

Fate of Escherichia coli O157 : H7 during on-farm dairy manure-based composting								JOURNAL OF FOOD PROTECTION				70	12			2708	2716					DEC 2007	2007	Studies were conducted to determine the fate of Escherichia coli O157:H-7 in dairy manure-based compost in a field setting. Two trials were performed involving duplicate compost heaps constructed at an outdoor fenced site. The compost heaps were composed of dairy manure, old hay, feed waste, a mixture of sawdust and calf feces, and fresh hay. Samples of the composting mixture were inoculated with stx-negative E. coli O157:H-7 B6914 at initial concentrations of 10(7) and 10(5) CFU/g for trial 1 and trial 2, respectively. Individual sample bags were placed on the surface and at three locations (top, center, and bottom) within each heap. Although the compost heaps achieved temperatures of 50 C or above at all internal locations for at least 7 days, temperature stratification was observed. In trial 1, E. coli O157:H-7 was detected by enrichment through 14 days within the heaps. When inoculated with 10(5) CFU/g in trial 2, E. coli O157:H-7 was detected only through days 2, 2,,and 5 at the top, center, and bottom locations, respectively. For both trials, the pathogen survived at the heap's surface for up to 4 months. The indicator commensal E. coli and coliforms were inactivated at a rate similar to that for E. coli O157:H-7. Results indicate that composting, with periodic heap turning, can be a practical approach to inactivating E. coli O157:H-7 in cattle wastes on the farm. Our data also suggest when compost heaps are not turned, E. coli O157:H-7 may survive for months at the heap surface.									36	0	0	31	0	37			0362-028X	1944-9097		WOS:000251482800001	18095421

Determinants of the use of relational and nonrelational information sources								JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS				24	3			297	331		10.2753/MIS0742-1222240310			WIN 2007	2007	Although it has been argued that knowledge is an important organizational resource, little research has investigated where individuals go to search for information or knowledge. Prior work has investigated sources in isolation, but in an organizational setting, sources are encountered as an open portfolio instead of in isolation. it is important to understand how individuals perceive the wide array of sources available to them and how those perceptions affect their use of different types of sources. Building on prior work, this research looks at factors underlying the selection of sources that require direct interpersonal contact (relational sources) and those that do not (nonrelational sources) and explores factors that differentially affect the use of these types of sources. A sample of 204 working professionals recruited from graduate business studies was used to test hypotheses regarding the effects of accessibility and quality, as well as comparisons and trade-offs between relational and nonrelational sources. Consistent with prior work, source accessibility and quality significantly affect usage of a source. This relationship, however, is moderated by the type of source with accessibility having less effect on the use of relational sources. Furthermore, use of each type of source was also affected by the perceived accessibility and quality of alternative types of sources. Together these results highlight the importance of simultaneously considering the relational and nonrelational sources available to individuals. These results also have implications for the design and implementation of systems for managing information and knowledge assets.									16	0	0	0	0	16			0742-1222			WOS:000252906300011

In this paper, the writers investigate the compatibility between selected cementitious repair materials and a substrate concrete using a modified ASTM C 78 test procedure. The flexural strength and load-deflection curves of composite beams prepared with substrate concrete and repair materials were compared to the results from the substrate beam to assess the compatibility. In addition, the influence of three different types of curing conditions was evaluated on the compatibility between the repair materials and substrate concrete. Compressive strength, flexural strength, split tensile strength, and drying shrinkage of the repair materials and substrate concrete were individually measured to aid in the analysis of compatibility between repair and substrate materials. It was observed that not only did significant differences in strength between the repair material and substrate concrete cause incompatible failures, but high drying shrinkage of the repair materials was also found to cause incompatible failure. These findings validate previous research findings.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0899-1561			WOS:000251076900006

Laboratory study of the effects of compaction on the volumetric and rutting properties of CRM asphalt mixtures								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING				19	12			1079	1089		10.1061/(ASCE)0899-1561(2007)19:12(1079)			DEC 2007	2007	The compaction conditions (e.g., compaction temperature and compaction level) of crumb rubber modified (CRM) asphalt mixtures should be determined carefully because the viscosity and amount of the CRM binder affects the compactability of the mixtures. Furthermore, the properties of CRM mixtures relating to the compaction conditions have not been studied in great detail. In this study, a laboratory investigation was conducted on the volumetric and rutting properties of CRM mixtures as a function of compaction conditions. For this research work, four Superpave mix designs for four different asphalt binders (control, SBS modified, 10% rubber modified, and 15% rubber modified) were carried out to determine the optimum asphalt contents. A total of 260 specimens were fabricated using the Superpave gyratory compactor at four compaction temperatures (116, 135, 154, and 173 degrees C) and five compaction levels (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 gyrations). The volumetric properties were obtained and analyzed, and the rutting resistance of the mixtures was measured using the asphalt pavement analyzer. The results from this study indicated that: (1) the compaction temperatures used in this study significantly affected the volumetric properties of the CRM mixtures, unlike the control and SBS-modified mixtures; (2) in general, the air void contents of the mixtures were significantly influenced by the compaction levels; and (3) as expected, the higher air void contents of the CRM mixtures seemed to have a detrimental effect on the rutting resistance.									19	2	0	0	0	21			0899-1561			WOS:000251076900008

Effect of lattice hydroxyl on the phase transition and dielectric properties of barium titanate particles								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS				18	12			1221	1227		10.1007/s10854-007-9296-3			DEC 2007	2007	Presence of the hydroxyls in the lattice is believed to be the major cause of the reduced tetragonality in the barium titanate ceramic powder. Commercial barium titanate that is known to be cubic in nature has been used in this study. This sub-micron powder is treated with N-Methyl-2-Pyrrolidinon (NMP) to obtain a tetragonal powder as confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis, differential scanning calorimetry and the c/a ratio. The dielectric constant of a single particle of this NMP treated cubic powder is reported to be around 64% higher than the as-received cubic powder. To add weight to the hypothesis mentioned hitherto, simulation experiments have been performed by aging in acidic water, with a pH similar to 3-4 and in basic water, with a pH similar to 12-13. The as-received cubic barium titanate powder, calcined at different temperatures, has been aged in different pH conditions, acid and basic waters. Then the powder is further used for the characterization of electrical properties. The dielectric properties of the barium titante ceramic powder that is determined does depend inversely on the lattice OH content as confirmed by FT-IR spectroscopic analysis and TGA results.									12	0	0	1	0	12			0957-4522			WOS:000249406100009

Large-scale testing of a replaceable "Fuse" steel coupling beam								JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING-ASCE				133	12			1801	1807		10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(2007)133:12(1801)			DEC 2007	2007	When coupled core wall (CCW) systems are built in regions of high seismicity, the ductility demands on the coupling beams can be of critical concern. Steel coupling beams, whether encased in concrete or not, offer a very high degree of ductility relative to common concrete coupling beams. Hybrid core wall systems, that is CCW systems with steel or steel/concrete composite coupling beams, provide excellent lateral stiffness from the walls and coupling action, while providing excellent energy dissipation and ductility characteristics of steel coupling beams. Previous research pertaining to steel coupling beams has made great strides in furthering the understanding of the behavior of steel coupling beams, and recommendations regarding design methodologies have been established. However, as steel coupling beam ends are embedded in the wall piers, postdamage repair can be costly. This paper presents the results of large-scale cyclic tests of a steel coupling beam designed and detailed based on the writers' previous recommendations and an innovative "fuse" steel coupling beam which provides an added feature to the steel coupling beam in that postdamage repair/replacement difficulties and expenses are minimized.									17	20	0	0	0	36			0733-9445			WOS:000251069900013

A rapid and reliable molecular protocol that also uses morphology is proposed because conventional approaches to associating undescribed larvae with adults have been slow and problematic. Male adults were identified before DNA sequence analyses were used. These identifications established morphospecies boundaries that were mapped on phylograms constructed from 2 independent gene fragments: mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and large subunit (28S) nuclear ribosomal DNA expansion fragment D2 (D2). Species boundaries were confirmed if they were monophyletic on both molecular phylograms. Larval associations were made with reference to the phylogenetic analyses under 2 criteria: sequence identity across both genes or nested placement within a reference species boundary. A total of 133 individuals belonging to Chinese Hydropsyche sensu lato group (including Hydropsyche [Hydropsyche], Hydropsyche [Occutanspsyche], Ceratopsyche, Mexipsyche, Hydatomanicus, and Herbertorossia) were included in our study to test the new protocol. D2 sequences (all individuals) and COI sequences (101 individuals) were obtained, and 2 independent phylograms were constructed using neighbor joining. Both fragments provided enough nucleotide changes to differentiate independently most Hydropsyche sensu lato species, with ambiguity in only a few species that eventually could be resolved with additional sequences and specimens. COI diverges significantly within some species, suggesting a need for caution when applying typical genetic divergence thresholds in species diagnoses. The study enabled us to establish a procedure for delimiting species boundaries and associating larvae and adults using DNA sequences and morphological evidence. Ideal sampling strategies for larval-adult association are suggested. Associating larvae and adults of hydropsychids using DNA sequences appears to be promising in terms of both reliability and speed.									61	2	0	63	1	67			0887-3593			WOS:000250645500012

Individuals of this species on the Attwater Prairie Chicken National Wildlife Refuge, Colorado Co., TX, have been attacked in successive winters, 2005-2006, by the blood-feeding black fly Cnephia ornithophilia. Attwater's Prairie-Chicken is a previously unreported host for Cnephia ornithophilia. Molecular screening indicated that about 15% of 13 blood-fed flies sampled from captured Attwater's Prairie-Chickens carried a parasite of the genus Leucocytozoon that can cause a debilitating avian malaria-like disease. If blood feeding or transmission of the disease agent becomes a threat to the birds, particularly in years of lean food supply or harsh weather, management of Cnephia ornithophilia should be considered.									4	0	0	4	0	4			1081-1710			WOS:000252478300021	18260522

We tested the ability to distinguish between heated and unheated targets in three species of pitvipers (Viperidae: Crotalinae), four species of true vipers, two species of colubrids (Colubridae: Natricinae, Colubrinae) and Azemiops feae (Viperidae: Azemiopinae). All species of pitvipers tested could distinguish between the warm and cool targets, while no tested species of true viper, colubrid or Azemiops demonstrated this ability. In addition, pitvipers exhibited behaviors that true vipers or Azemiops did not exhibit. Our results suggest that the tested species of true vipers, Azemiops and colubrids may not posses the ability to sense infrared radiation or do not use it in a defensive context, and suggest that some defensive behaviors are associated with the pit organ in pitvipers.									3	0	0	4	0	4			0952-8369			WOS:000250944800012

In this work, a new and a simple method has been applied to measure the dielectric constant of polyvinyl cyanoethylate/barium titanate composites. The results are obtained by dispersing the ceramic powders in the polymer of a relatively low dielectric constant value. The dielectric constant of the composites is measured with varying ceramic volume percentages. The obtained results are compared with the many available theoretical models that are generally in practice to predict the dielectric constant of the composites. Then these results are extrapolated to comprehend the dielectric constant values of ceramic particles as these values form the base for the design of the composite. The precision and simplicity of the method can be exploited for predictions of the properties of nanostructure ferroelectric polymer/ceramic composites. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The pressure-driven flow and the resulting electroosmotic backflow exhibit coupled dispersion effects in nanoscale channels where the hydraulic diameter is on the order of the electrical double layer thickness. An effective diffusion coefficient for this regime is derived. The influence of streaming potential on hydrodynamic dispersion is found to be mainly dependent on an electrokinetic parameter, previously termed the "figure of merit". Results indicate that streaming potential decreases the effective diffusion coefficient of the solute, while increasing the dispersion coefficient as traditionally defined. This discrepancy arises from the additional effect of streaming potential on average solute velocity, and discussed herein.									17	0	0	7	0	17			1613-4982			WOS:000250581900010

Baseline and differential sensitivity to two QoI Fungicides among isolates of Phytophthora cactorum that cause leather rot and crown rot on strawberry								PLANT DISEASE				91	12			1625	1637		10.1094/PDIS-91-12-1625			DEC 2007	2007	Sensitivities of 89 isolates of Phytophthora cactorum, the causal agent of crown rot and leather rot on strawberry plants, from seven states (Florida, Maine, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, and New York) to the QoI fungicide azoxystrobin were determined based on mycelium growth and zoospore germination. Radial growth of mycelia on lima bean agar amended with azoxystrobin at 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10, and 30 mu g/ml and salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM) at 100 mu g/ml was measured after 6 days. Effect on zoospore germination was evaluated in aqueous solutions of azoxystrobin at 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 mu g/ml in 96-well microtiter plates by counting germinated and nongerminated zoospores after 4 h at room temperature. SHAM was not used to evaluate zoospore sensitivity. The effective dose to reduce mycelium growth by 50% (ED50) ranged from 0.16 to 12.52 mu g/ml for leather rot isolates and 0.10 to 15 mu g/ml for crown rot isolates. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test showed significant differences (P < 0.001) between the two distributions. Zoospores were much more sensitive to azoxystrobin than were mycelia. Differences between sensitivity distributions for zoospores from leather rot and crown rot isolates were significant at P = 0.05. Estimated ED50 values ranged from 0.01 to 0.24 mu g/ml with a median of 0.04 mu g/ml. Experiments with pyraclostrobin, another QoI fungicide, demonstrated that both mycelia and zoospores of P. cactorum were more sensitive to pyraclostrobin than to azoxystrobin. Sensitivities to azoxystrobin and pyraclostrobin were moderately but significantly correlated (r = 0.60, P = 0.0001).									10	1	0	10	0	11			0191-2917			WOS:000251017400015

A role for F-Actin in hexokinase-mediated glucose signaling(1[C][W][OA])								PLANT PHYSIOLOGY				145	4			1423	1434		10.1104/pp.107.108704			DEC 2007	2007	HEXOKINASE1 (HXK1) from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) has dual roles in glucose (Glc) signaling and in Glc phosphorylation. The cellular context, though, for HXK1 function in either process is not well understood. Here we have shown that within normal experimental detection limits, AtHXK1 is localized continuously to mitochondria. Two mitochondrial porin proteins were identified as capable of binding to overexpressed HXK1 protein, both in vivo and in vitro. We also found that AtHXK1 can be associated with its structural homolog, F-actin, based on their coimmunoprecipitation from transgenic plants that overexpress HXK1-FLAG or from transient expression assays, and based on their localization in leaf cells after cryofixation. This association might be functionally important because Glc signaling in protoplast transient expression assays is compromised by disruption of F-actin. We also demonstrate that Glc treatment of Arabidopsis seedlings rapidly and reversibly disrupts fine mesh actin filaments. The possible roles of actin in HXK-dependent Glc signaling are discussed.									38	5	0	36	0	42			0032-0889			WOS:000251396300033	17965176

BODA monomers undergo thermal step-growth polymerization and careful control of this conversion, with respect to molecular weight and viscosity, can be used to produce reactive, processable branched polyarlyene intermediates. "Soft-lithography" techniques were used to prepare submicrogratings from these intermediates, which were subsequently stabilized by further polymerization. The surface morphology and dimensions of the submicrogratings were examined using scanning electron microscopy techniques and crystallinity was studied. Reflectivity data was also obtained from linear submicrogratings. These BODA-derived microstructures can be carbonized at 1000 degrees C, or above, to obtain carbonized microstructures with potential for application in optical and electronic microdevices. POLYM.

Methodologies of tissue preservation and analysis of the glycogen content of the broiler chick liver								POULTRY SCIENCE				86	12			2653	2665		10.3382/ps.2007-00303			DEC 2007	2007	The current study was performed to develop convenient, rapid, reliable, and pragmatic methodologies by which to harvest and preserve liver tissue glycogen and to analyze its levels within reasonable limits of quantification and with extended chromophore stability. Absorbance values decreased by 2 h and again by 24 h after preparation of the iodine-potassium iodide chromophore, whereas absorbance values of the phenol-sulfuric acid chromophore remained constant over the same time period. These absorbance trends for each chromophore followed full color development within 5 min after combining the analyte with the respective chromophore reagent. Use of the phenol-sulfuric acid reagent allowed for a 10-fold reduction in assay limits of detection and quantification when compared with the iodine-potassium iodide reagent. Furthermore, glycogen concentration-absorbance relationships were affected by the source (i.e., rabbit liver vs. bovine liver) of glycogen standards when the iodine-potassium iodide chromophore was used, but the source of the standards had no influence when the phenol-sulfuric acid chromophore was used. The indifference of the phenol-sulfuric acid method to the glycogen source, as exhibited by similar linear regressions of absorbance, may be attributed to actual determination of glucose subunit concentrations after complete glycogen hydrolysis by sulfuric acid. This is in contrast to the actual measurement of whole glycogen, which may exhibit source- or time-related molecular structural differences. The iodine-potassium iodide methodology is a test of whole glycogen concentrations; therefore, it may be influenced by glycogen structural differences. Liver tissue sample weight (between 0.16 and 0.36 g) and processing, which included mincing, immediate freezing, or refrigeration in 10% perchloric acid for 1 wk prior to tissue grinding, had no effect on glycogen concentrations that were analyzed by using the phenol-sulfuric acid reagent. These results indicate that small field samples may be minced, immediately placed in 10% perchloric acid without freezing, and then processed in the laboratory up to I wk later when using a phenol-sulfuric acid reagent, as described in this study, to determine the glycogen concentration in broiler chick livers accurately.									24	0	0	18	0	24			0032-5791			WOS:000251396500022	18029813

The loss modulus (G '') was found to be higher than the storage modulus (G') at all frequencies (similar to 0.1 to similar to 100 rad/s) and temperatures (280-305 degrees C) tested. The slope of the low-frequency terminal zone for G' was found to be approximately 0.8, much lower than a value of 2 that is observed for flexible chain polymers. Cross-polarized optical microscopy with full-wave retardation plate confirmed the presence of different textures of mesophase pitch processed under different conditions. While loss moduli remained fairly unchanged, finer textures led to significantly lower storage moduli. Consistent with this trend, coarsening of the microstructure during textural relaxation led to an increase in storage moduli. Therefore, for the discotic mesophase pitch, the viscous component was found to remain unaffected by the microstructure, but the elastic modulus was dependent on the orientation of layer-planes and size of the texture.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0035-4511			WOS:000251426600007

Identification of random amplified polymorphic DNA markers for resistance to green leafhopper (Nephotetlix virescens distant) in rice								SABRAO JOURNAL OF BREEDING AND GENETICS				39	2			127	141					DEC 2007	2007	Green leafhopper, Nephotettix virescens Distant (abbr. GLH), is one of the major pests of rice causing severe yield losses in Asia. Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis was done in an F-2 population derived from a cross between a resistant cultivar Ptb8 and a susceptible cultivar TN1 to identify DNA markers linked to GLH resistance. RAPD analysis using 141 decamers identified 110 primers detecting polymorphism between the parents. Bulked Segregant Analysis (BSA) of the resistant and susceptible F-2 plants using these primers identified six polymorphic primers that amplified eight RAPD markers putatively linked to GLH resistance. These six primers were also used for BSA of F-2 plants differing contrastingly for total tiller number, effective tiller number, and 100 grain-weight to find out the association, if any, of GLH resistance with these and among the traits. A partial linkage map was constructed with six RAPD loci and one simply inherited trait locus glh(ibl), which was flanked by OPJ18 (648) and OPA19(320) with a distance of 31.1 cM (rf: 0.276) and 27.7 cM (rf: 0.252), respectively. This is the first report of mapping a gene conferring resistance to an Indian biotype (113) of GLH. Interval mapping detected four putative quantitative trait loci (QTLs) each controlling resistance to green leafhopper (QGLH(IB)), total tiller number (QTT), effective tiller number (QET), and 100-grain weight (QGW). The confidence interval of the GLH QTL coincided with the glh(ibl) locus and accounted for about 90% of the phenotypic variation for GLH resistance in the F-2 population. This indicated the involvement of a single major gene conferring GLH resistance, named herewith as glh(ibl).									1	0	0	1	0	1			1029-7073			WOS:000254857700006

Our current test suite consists of large, open-source applications with diverse problem domains, including language processing and gaming. Our tool chain is designed using a GXL-based pipe-filter architecture; therefore, the individual applications and libraries that constitute our tool chain each provide a point of access. The preferred point of access is the g4api Application Programming Interface (API), which is located at the end of the chain. g4api provides access to information about the C++ program under study, including information about declarations, such as classes (including template instantiations); namespaces; functions; and variables, statements and some expressions.

Irreversible fouling during multicycle microfiltration of wastewater effluent								WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH				79	13			2527	2535		10.2175/106143007X212175			DEC 2007	2007	This study focused on irreversible fouling during microfiltration of primary and secondary effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants. Flow resistances were calculated from the sum of clean membrane resistances, resultant cake layer resistances, and consequent irreversible fouling resistances. Results from a dead-end cell experimental system showed that the accumulated cake resistance was dominating for microfiltration of primary/secondary effluents. Suspended solids in the primary and secondary effluents had a similar compressibility index, n, with a value of approximately 0.5, indicating that they were moderately compressible particles. The value of irreversible resistance is dependent on the intensity of membrane cleaning; however, for a given membrane cleaning strategy, this value steadily increased and reached a maximum after approximately 6 cycles of filtration and cleaning. This study provided an explanation for the significant drop of throughput flux in the early application of membrane processes, and a plateau flux approached correspondingly.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1061-4303			WOS:000255663400008	18198698

Effect of tillage and soyabean on Ipomoea lacunosa and Senna obtusifolia emergence								WEED RESEARCH				47	6			499	508		10.1111/j.1365-3180.2007.00585.x			DEC 2007	2007	Field experiments were conducted in Pendleton, South Carolina, USA, in 2004 and 2005 to determine the influence of spring tillage and no spring tillage with and without soyabean on Ipomoea lacunosa and Senna obtusifolia emergence. Ipomoea lacunosa emergence was observed from 20 April to 12 November 2004 and 19 April to 7 November 2005, with peak emergence occurring from May to early August. Ipomoea lacunosa emergence patterns were impacted minimally by soyabean and total emergence were similar with and without a soyabean canopy. Tillage generally promoted I. lacunosa emergence, reducing the time needed to achieve 25%, 50%, and 75% emergence. Senna obtusifolia emergence was observed from 26 April to 12 November 2004 and 18 April to 13 November 2005. Tillage shortened the time to 25% of total emergence by 8 to 25 days. Following soyabean canopy formation, S. obtusifolia emergence was generally negatively impacted by soyabean, but some emergence still occurred under the canopy. Peak periods of S. obtusifolia emergence occurred from early May to early October. Overall, I. lacunosa and S. obtusifolia emergence periods were similar, with both species exhibiting continual emergence from spring to early autumn. Continual emergence of I. lacunosa and S. obtusifolia beneath a soyabean canopy contributes to the difficulty in managing these weeds. The study demonstrates that an appropriate combination of sowing soyabean in late May, minimising tillage and sowing at a rate to maximise crop canopy closure will contribute significantly to management of these two important weed species.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0043-1737			WOS:000250765900005

We found that: (1) R koraiensis was a discontinuously regenerating population, while Tilia arnurensis and Quercus mongolica were continuously regenerating populations, and Fraxinus mandshurica might be a declining population. (2) Intra- and interspecies spatial associations of varied with species, tree height, and scales. P. koraiensis and T amurensis at the lower height classes showed positive association to most species at the upper height class at almost all scales, suggesting that they have broad niches and grow well under the canopy of other species. Q. mongolica at the lower height classes showed spatial independence at smaller scales and negative association at larger scales to non-conspecific adults, suggesting that spatial heterogeneity may be important to generate patterns. (3) Scale is an important factor for pattern formation, and different species showed different distribution patterns and spatial associations at different scales. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

It was found that their electronic HOMO-LUMO gaps depend pronouncedly on the size of the cage, from a large band gap for Gd3N@C-80 (2.02 V) to a small band gap for Gd3N@C-88 (1.49 V). The electrochemical properties also change dramatically with the size of the cage, going from irreversible for the C-80 cage to reversible for Gd3N@C-88. The latter is the largest trimetallic cluster inside C-88 isolated and characterized to date. Gd3N@C-88 has one of the lowest electrochemical energy gaps for a nonderivatized metallofullerene.									61	0	0	6	0	61			0002-7863			WOS:000251142200055	17983231

The brush adopts ripple and dimple morphologies upon exposure to toluene and acetone, respectively. The same locations on the brush samples, adopting these two morphologies, were scanned with AFM before and after each etching step. We found that the ripple morphology consists of depressed PS-rich and elevated PMMA-rich elongated domains. In the dimple morphology, the core of the cluster is rich in PS, while the very top layer and the valleys between clusters are rich in PMMA. These experimental observations agree with self-consistent field theoretical predictions of the phase segregated morphologies in nonselective and selective solvents. The 3D structures of the mixed brushes in dry and swollen states were reconstrubted using nanotomography data.									52	0	0	0	0	52			0024-9297			WOS:000251094500039

Previous spectra, acquired during outburst in 2004 February and July, had shown the CO emission lines to be broad and centrally peaked, similar to the CO spectrum of a typical classical T Tauri star. In this Letter, we present CO spectra acquired shortly after the luminosity of the source returned to its pre-outburst level (2006 February) and roughly 1 year later (2006 December and 2007 February). The spectrum taken in 2006 February revealed blueshifted CO absorption lines superimposed on the previously observed CO emission lines. The projected velocity, column density, and temperature of this outflowing gas were 30 km s(-1), 3(-1)(+2) x 10(18) cm(-2), and 700(-100)(+300) K, respectively. The absorption lines were not observed in the 2006 December and 2007 February data, and so their strengths must have decreased in the interim by a factor of 9 or more. We discuss three mechanisms that could give rise to this unusual outflow.									10	0	0	0	0	10			0004-637X			WOS:000250965700008		
J	Hong, Sung Hoon; Cho, Byung Rae								Joint optimization of process target mean and tolerance limits with measurement errors under multi-decision alternatives								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH				183	1			327	335		10.1016/j.ejor.2006.09.063			NOV 16 2007	2007	Determining the optimal target mean for a process has been identified as an important research area and a number of models have been proposed in the literature. This paper differs from previous studies of this problem in two ways. First, most previous studies address the process target problem through models seeking the optimal process mean using fixed tolerance settings of a process. Second, in real-world industrial settings, there are several markets often available with different price/cost structures. In this paper, we develop a model for jointly determining both the optimal process target mean and the optimal tolerance limits under the situation where there are several markets available with different price/cost structures. We then investigate the effects of measurement errors on the optimum process target and tolerance limits with multi-decision alternatives. A numerical example is given, and sensitivity analyses are also performed to study the effects of measurement errors on this model. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The selected adsorbents had a wide range of pore size distributions but similar surface acidity and hydrophobicity. Single solute and preloading (with a dissolved organic matter (DOM)) isotherms were performed. Single solute adsorption results showed that (i) the adsorbents having higher amounts of pores with sizes about the dimensions of the adsorbate molecules exhibited higher uptakes, (ii) there were some pore structure characteristics, which were not completely captured by pore size distribution analysis, that also affected the adsorption, and (iii) the BET surface area and total pore volume were not the primary factors controlling the adsorption of SOCs. The preloading isotherm results showed that for TCE adsorbing primarily in pores < 10 angstrom, the highly microporous ACF and GACs, acting like molecular sieves, exhibited the highest uptakes. For atrazine with an optimum adsorption pore region of 10-20 angstrom, which overlaps with the adsorption region of some DOM components, the GACs with a broad pore size distribution and high pore volumes in the 10-20 angstrom region had the least impact of DOM on the adsorption.									15	1	0	11	0	15			0013-936X			WOS:000250974700047	18075104

Crystallization behavior of carbon nanofiber/linear low density polyethylene nanocomposites								JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE				106	4			2605	2614		10.1002/app.26800			NOV 15 2007	2007	Crystallization behavior of LLDPE nanocomposites is reported in the presence of three types of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) (MJ, PR-19, and PR-24). During nonisothermal crystallization studies, all three crystalline melting peaks for LLDPE matrix were observed in the presence of PR-19 nanofibers (up to 15 wt % content), but only the high- and low-temperature peaks were observed in the presence MJ nanofibers. The broad melting peak at low-temperature became bigger, suggesting an increase in the relative content of thinner lamellae in the presence of MJ nanofibers. TEM results of nanocomposites revealed transcrystallinity of LLDPE on the surface of CNFs, and slightly broader distribution of lamellar thickness. STEM studies revealed a rougher surface morphology of the MJ nanofibers relative to that of PR nanofibers. Also, BET studies confirmed a larger specific surface area of MJ nanofibers relative to that of PR nanofibers, suggesting that the larger and the rougher surface of MJ nanofibers contributes toward the different crystallization behavior of MJ/LLDPE nanocomposites.

The catalyst was prepared using coprecipitation, pretreated in CO, then one sample passivated and one calcined. The XRD data show that after CO pretreatment the calcined and passivated catalysts are almost amorphous with respect to Fe2O3 with nanoparticle size of 10 and 100 angstrom for Fe3C (only present in the passivated sample). Least squares fitting of the XANES region show that the calcined and passivated samples were similar in the bulk and surface structures, with the calcined samples completely oxidized. As expected, K and L-III edges Mo-XANES shows only small molybdenum carbide formation compared to iron carbide. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The temperature dependence of conductance of the network indicates a 2D Mott variable-range hopping (VRH) transport mechanism. Electric field and temperature are shown to have similar effects on the carrier hops and identical exponents for the conductance of the network are obtained from the high electric field and temperature dependences. A power-law temperature dependence with an exponent 3/2 for the threshold field is obtained and explained as a result of the competing contributions from electric field and phonons to the carrier hop. A negative magnetoresistance (MR) is observed at low temperatures, which arises from a forward interference scattering mechanism in the weak scattering limit, consistent with the VRH transport.									20	0	0	0	0	20			0953-8984			WOS:000250688400018

The procedure of PEM patterning consisted of three steps: nano-striped pattern formation, PEM deposition, and chemical crosslinking. It was observed that the PEMs were selectively deposited on the EAA layers and linked through covalent bonds, but those on LLDPE layers were washed off during sonication in water and methanol. In addition, the reactive moieties introduced by PEMs were successfully used to bond covalently with other important molecules, such as amine-terminated fluorescein. This kind of nano-striped surface with alternating wettability could serve as a template for many applications, including biomedical, separations, and electronics. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of nisin and/or lysozyme in combination with in-package pasteurization of a ready-to-eat low-fat turkey bologna on the inactivation of Listeria monocytogenes. Sterile bologna samples were initially treated with solutions of nisin (2 mg/ml = 5,000 AU/ml = 31.25 AU/cm(2)), lysozyme (10 mg/ml = 80 AU/ml = 0.5 AU/cm(2)), and a mixture of nisin and lysozyme (2 mg/ml nisin + 10 mg/ml lysozyme = 31.75 AU/cm(2)). Bologna surfaces were uniformly inoculated with a Listeria suspension resulting in a population of approximately 0.5 log CFU/cm(2). Samples were vacuum packaged and subjected to heat treatment (60, 62.5, or 65 degrees C). Two nonlinear models (Weibull and log logistic) were used to analyze the data. From the model parameters, the time needed to achieve a 4-log reduction was calculated. The nisin-lysozyme combination and nisin treatments were effective in reducing the time required for 4-log reductions at 62.5 and 65 degrees C but not at 60 degrees C. At 62.5 degrees C, nisin-lysozyme-treated samples required 23% less time than did the control sample to achieve a 4-log reduction and 31 % less time at 65 degrees C. Lysozyme alone did not enhance antilisterial activity with heat. Results from this study can be useful to the industry for developing an efficient intervention strategy against contamination of ready-to-eat meat products by L. monocytogenes.									12	1	0	11	0	15			0362-028X			WOS:000250744100007	18044427

Thatch and mat management in an established creeping bentgrass golf green								AGRONOMY JOURNAL				99	6			1530	1537		10.2134/agronj2006.0361			NOV-DEC 2007	2007	Thatch is a layer of partially decomposed organic matter between green shoot tissue and the soil surface, and mat is thatch partially intermixed with topsoil. Excessive thatch-mat layering (>2.54 cm) is generally detrimental to turfgrass management, and numerous techniques including various mechanical and topdressing regimes, have been attempted to reduce its severity. This factorial experiment investigated the effectiveness of combining mechanical-biological and topdressing treatments for controlling thatch-mat levels in an established USGA-specified golf green planted with 'A-l' creeping bentgrass [Agrostis stoloniferous L. var. palustris (Huds.)]. Two levels of topdressing were used, and the mechanical-biological treatments included vertical mowing at two different depths and timings, core cultivation, grooming, a biological granular supplement (Thatch-X), and combinations of core cultivation with grooming and/or vertical mowing. Differences among the mechanical-biological treatments were detected following 2 consecutive yearly applications. Thatch-mat depth (mm) was 12 to 15% greater for Thatch-X and topdressing alone compared with other treatments. Organic matter content (g kg(-1)) increased 32% for the untreated and decreased 19% for core cultivation combined with vertical mowing and grooming, whereas all other treatments maintained pre-study levels. Compared with the untreated, surface hardness was reduced similar to 9% for all treatments using core cultivation, while water infiltration rates increased 127 to 168%. Vertical mowing treatments improved water infiltration rates by 40 to 65%. Turfgrass quality was not greatly impacted by the mechanical-biological treatments as ratings ranged from 8.4 to 10.0. However, mower scalping and dry spots contributed to unacceptable or only marginally acceptable turfgrass quality (6.4-7.2) for the untreated by the end of the study. Compared with topdressing alone, ball roll distance was decreased 6% by vertical mowing 7 days after treatment (DAT) and 5 to 8% by core cultivation up to 14 DAT. Sand topdressing alone was insufficient for managing thatch-mat levels in an established creeping bentgrass golf green.									36	0	0	34	0	36			0002-1962			WOS:000251104400015

In vivo studies investigate the response to angioplasty injury, but limited studies have been performed using in vitro systems. In order to study SMC response in vitro, a concurrent shear and tensile forces simulator has been developed to provide clinically significant levels of strain and shear stresses in addition to simulating forces similar to those during balloon angioplasty. In this acute study ( 8 hr), rat aortic SMCs demonstrated significant cell proliferation following applied increased tensile forces of angioplasty injury and shear exposure when compared to lower levels of tensile exposure similar to a normal physiological level, with an average 75% increase in the number of cells of the injury group compared to the normal dynamic group. SMCs exposed to balloon angioplasty injury and concurrent shear and tensile mechanical forces demonstrated decreased expression of the contractile phenotypic marker smooth muscle alpha-actin. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of the developed model for in vitro angioplasty and the simulated mechanical environment to the cells. This provides an in vitro model to isolate the effects of concurrent mechanical forces and could also potentially act as a preliminary step toward use in pharmaceutical research for reduction or prevention of SMC proliferation due to altered mechanical forces during endovascular procedures.									5	0	0	2	0	5			0890-5096			WOS:000254207600011	17923382

Ten weight percent Cu was first impregnated into gamma-alumina to produce Cu-modified Al2O3 supports; then 20 wt.% of Fe and (in some cases) 1 wt.% Cu were added to the supports by the sequential impregnation method. Two different pretreatment methods (drying or drying and calcining) were employed after each metal impregnation. It was found that the use of Cu-modified Al2O3 supports increased significantly the overall activity of the Fe/Al2O3 catalysts. Addition of 1% Cu as a reduction promoter to the Cu-modified supported Fe catalysts was not necessary since it did not further enhance the activity of the catalysts. There were no changes in FT product selectivity, chain growth probability (alpha), or olefin selectivity due to any effect of the Cu-modified Al2O3 or Cu-promotion. However, the more calcination steps used during preparation, the higher the catalyst activity obtained. Cu-modification of the alumina most probably diminished the interaction/reaction of the Fe with the support, thereby improving its chemisorption and catalytic properties. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Effects of soil decompaction and amendment on root growth and architecture in red maple (Acer rubrum)								Arboriculture & Urban Forestry				33	6			428	432					NOV 2007	2007	The Terravent(TM) soil injection device (Pinnacle Concepts, Ltd., Cornwall, UK) uses compressed nitrogen as to fracture compacted soil and permits the subsequent injection of liquid amendments. In the current study, we measured fine root growth and architecture in soil that had received one of four treatments: 1) Terravent injections, 2) Terravent injections followed by liquid amendment (MycorTree((R)) Injectable; PHC, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, U.S.), 3) addition of amendment only, and 4) an untreated control. The experiment was conducted on ten red maples (Acer rubrum) growing on a moderately compacted urban clay soil next to a busy road on the Clemson University campus. Treatments were applied in April 2002. Seven weeks later. soil cores were pulled from locations adjacent to the injection sites, and fine roots (less than 2 mm [0.08 in] in diameter) from each core were washed free of soil. A variety of root parameters were measured, including length, surface area, diameter distribution, and mass. Terravent treatment had no effect on any root parameters measured. Application of MycorTree was associated with small, statistically significant reductions in root diameter, root mass density (mg root/cm(3) soil), and root surface area density (cm(2) root/cm(3) soil).									0	0	0	0	0	0			1935-5297			BCI:BCI200800035018

The objective of this study was to evaluate the immune function of juvenile chickens after in ovo exposure to PCB 126 or an environmentally relevant OC mixture extracted from eggs of double crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) from Green Bay, Lake Michigan, USA. Fertile white leghorn chicken (Gallus domesticus) eggs were injected before incubation with 0.55-1.79 ng TCDD equivalents (TEQ)/egg PCB 126 and 1.2-4.9 ng TEQs/egg of cormorant egg extract into the air cell in two separate experiments. After hatching, the immune function was tested using in vivo phytohemagglutinin (PHA) skin response in 11-day-old chicks, antibody titers to immunization with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) in 28-day-old chicks, and, at necropsy, thymus and bursal mass and cellularity. PCB 126 decreased antibody titers at all doses and decreased the thymus and bursa index but not cellularity at 1.79 ng TEQ/egg. The cormorant egg extract caused no significant alterations in immune function even though it has been demonstrated as immunotoxic in chicken embryos. However, twofold to threefold increases in total anti-SRBC titers in 28-day-old chicks exposed to 1.2 or 2.4 ng TEQ/egg of cormorant extract were similar to elevations in anti-SRBC titer observed in Caspian tern (Sterna caspia) chicks from a highly OC-contaminated site in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron. Posthatch exposure to OC through fish consumption in addition to in ovo OC exposure might be associated with the immune modulation reported in wild birds. Chicks in this study might have begun to compensate for embryonic immunotoxicity by the ages at which we studied them.									6	1	0	7	0	7			0090-4341			WOS:000250138000018	17882474

The objective of these studies was to investigate an approach for accelerating cellular remodeling based on the creation of semi-interpenetrating networks (IPNs) composed of hydrolytically degradable poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) diacrylate macromers and native, enzymatically degradable extracellular matrix (ECM) components (collagen, gelatin and hyaluronic acid (HA)). Among the three ECM components investigated, addition of HA at concentrations of 0.12% w/v and greater supported fibroblast spreading throughout the three-dimensional network and significantly increased proliferation relative to control hydrogels without HA. Incorporation of HA resulted in relatively small changes in hydrogel physical/chemical properties such as swelling, degradation rate, and elastic modulus. Fibroblast spreading was eliminated by the addition of hyaluronidase inhibitors, demonstrating that cell-mediated enzymatic degradation of HA is a necessary mechanism responsible for the observed increases in fibroblast activity. By accelerating early cellular remodeling and growth, these semi-IPNs may be useful vehicles for cell transplantation in a variety of tissue engineering applications. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Brock, Kelly; Talley, Kemper; Coley, Kacey; Kundrotas, Petras; Alexovy, Emil								Optimization of electrostatic interactions in protein-protein complexes								BIOPHYSICAL JOURNAL				93	10			3340	3352		10.1529/biophysj.107.112367			NOV 2007	2007	In this article, we present a statistical analysis of the electrostatic properties of 298 protein-protein complexes and 356 domain-domain structures extracted from the previously developed database of protein complexes (ProtCom, http:// www.ces.clemson.edu/compbio/protcom). For each structure in the dataset we calculated the total electrostatic energy of the binding and its two components, Coulombic and reaction field energy. It was found that in a vast majority of the cases (> 90%), the total electrostatic component of the binding energy was unfavorable. At the same time, the Coulombic component of the binding energy was found to favor the complex formation while the reaction field component of the binding energy opposed the binding. It was also demonstrated that the components in a wild-type (WT) structure are optimized/anti-optimized with respect to the corresponding distributions, arising from random shuffling of the charged side chains. The degree of this optimization was assessed through the Z-score of WT energy in respect to the random distribution. It was found that the Z-scores of Coulombic interactions peak at a considerably negative value for all 654 cases considered while the Z-score of the reaction field energy varied among different types of complexes. All these findings indicate that the Coulombic interactions within WT protein-protein complexes are optimized to favor the complex formation while the total electrostatic energy predominantly opposes the binding. This observation was used to discriminate WT structures among sets of structural decoys and showed that the electrostatic component of the binding energy is not a good discriminator of the WT; while, Coulombic or reaction field energies perform better depending upon the decoy set used.									34	1	0	22	0	35			0006-3495			WOS:000250577700002	17693468

Gene response of human monocytic cells for the detection of antimigraine activity of feverfew extracts								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY				85	11			1108	1115		10.1139/Y07-097			NOV 2007	2007	The herb feverfew is a folk remedy for various conditions, including inflammation, fever, psoriasis, rheumatism, and asthma. Like many herbal medicines, feverfew's mechanisms of action in the human body are largely unknown and its active ingredients remain elusive. Very often, different extraction methods of herb material produce different physical and biochemical properties and variation in clinical efficacy. We identified 3 major methods of extraction for feverfew aerial parts and used microarray technology to test the hypothesis that extracts produced by different methods elicit different gene expression profiles. We have identified approximately 200 genes that are consistently regulated by the 2 presumptive active antimigraine feverfew extracts but not associated with the inactive extract. Our results suggest that the presumptive active feverfew extracts potently stimulate more genes in human cells than the inactive extracts. We also identified several genes as unique signatures for these active extracts. All 3 feverfew extracts exhibited similar blockades on lipopolysaccharide-mediated TNF-alpha (tumor necrosis factor alpha) release, implicating that TNF-alpha is not responsible for the differences in the effects of the 3 feverfew extracts in human cells. In contrast, the active extracts more effectively suppressed CCL2 (also known as monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, MCP-1) than the inactive extracts, suggesting that CCL2 is a potential cellular target for feverfew's antimigraine effects.									3	0	0	2	0	3			0008-4212			WOS:000252309800007	18066113	
J	Rose, Dawn M.; Shier, Douglas R.								Cut scheduling in the apparel industry								COMPUTERS & OPERATIONS RESEARCH				34	11			3209	3228		10.1016/j.cor.2005.12.001			NOV 2007	2007	A problem encountered in the apparel industry is that of producing, with no excess, a known number of different styles from the same cloth. This situation occurs, for instance, in the case of special order or made-to-order garments. In the cutting process, plies of cloth are spread on a cutting table, and several patterns are placed across the top ply. Cutting out the patterns through all plies creates a set of bundles of garment pieces, and several such lays may be required to satisfy all demands. The cut scheduling problem concerns finding a feasible cutting schedule having the minimum number of lays. We present an exact enumerative approach that identifies all optimal solutions to a practically important variant of this problem. The availability of multiple solutions allows greater flexibility and permits decision makers to apply additional criteria in selecting an appropriate cutting schedule. Computational evidence shows that our approach can efficiently solve standard test problems from the literature as well as some very challenging examples provided by a global garment manufacturer.

J	Klein, Richard; Rai, Arun; Straub, Detmar W.								Competitive and cooperative positioning in supply chain logistics relationships								DECISION SCIENCES				38	4			611	646					NOV 2007	2007	Cooperative logistics relationships require the sharing of information, which must be enabled by the integration of disparate information systems across partners. In this article, we theorize business-to-business logistics relationships should be managed using cooperative and competitive postures. Based on data from 91 dyadic relationships using interorganizational information technology (IT), we find that performance gains accrue when parties share strategic information and customize IT; mutual trust enables IT customization and strategic-information flows and equitable relationship-specific investments positively impact IT customization, mutual trust, and performance. Among other scholarly and practical implications discussed, partners should compete on resources for IT customization and cooperate to share strategic information. Managers tend to think of relationships with firms as polar opposites and view them as entirely cooperative or entirely competitive. Our results support active balancing and understanding of both competitive and cooperative stances. Such an approach enables conditions for participation symmetry that yields greater performance gains.									83	0	0	0	1	84			0011-7315			WOS:000251414900004

The objective of this study was to measure the release rate of Pu and the changes in the Pu oxidation states from these Pu sources with the intent to develop a reactive transport model source-term. Pu(III)) and Pu(IV) sources had identical Pu concentration depth profiles and similar Pu release rates. Source release data indicate that Pu-IV(C2O4)(2) was the least mobile, whereas (PuO2)-O-VI(NO3)(2) was the most mobile. Synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (SXRF) revealed that Pu was very unevenly distributed on the sediment and Mn concentrations were too low (630 mg kg(-1)) and perhaps of the wrong mineralogy to influence Pu distribution The high stability of sorbed Pu(IV) is proposed to be due to the formation of a stable hydrolyzed Pu(IV) surface species. Plutonium X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) analysis conducted on sediment recovered at the end of the study from the Pu-IV(NO3)(4)- and (PuCl3)-Cl-III-amended lysimeters contained essentially identical Pu d istributions: approximately 37% Pu(III), 67% Pu(IV), 0% Pu(V), and 0% Pu(VI). These results were similar to those using a wet chemistry Pu oxidation state assay, except the latter method did not detect any Pu(Ill) present on the sediment but instead indicated that 93-98% of the Pu existed as Pu(IV). This discrepancy was likely attributable to incomplete extraction of sediment Pu(III) by the wet chemistry method. Although Pu has been known to exist in the +3 oxidation state under microbially induced reducing conditions for decades, to our knowledge, this is the first observation of steady-state Pu(III) in association with natural sediments. On the basis of thermodynamic considerations, Pu(III) has a wide potential distribution, especially in acidic environments, and as such may warrant further investigation.									33	10	0	22	0	43			0013-936X			WOS:000250556100039	18044520

Superficial digital flexor tendon lesions in racehorses as a sequela to muscle fatigue: A preliminary study								EQUINE VETERINARY JOURNAL				39	6			540	545		10.2746/042516407X212475			NOV 2007	2007	Reasons for performing study: Racing and training related lesions of the forelimb superficial digital flexor tendon are a common career ending injury to racehorses but aetiology and/or predisposing causes of the injury are not completely understood.Objectives: Although the injury takes place within the tendon, the lesion must be considered within the context of the function of the complete suspensory system of the distal limb, including the associated muscles.Methods: Both muscle and tendon function were investigated in vivo using implanted strain gauges in 3 Thoroughbred horses walking, trotting and cantering on a motorised treadmill. These data were combined with assessments of muscle architecture and fibre composition to arrive at an overview of the contribution of each muscle-tendon unit during locomotion.Results: The superficial digital flexor muscle has fatigue-resistant and high force production properties that allow its tendon to store and return elastic energy, predominantly at the trot. As running speed increases, deep digital flexor tendon force increases and it stabilises hyperextension of the fetlock, thus reinforcing the superficial digital flexor in limb load support. The deep digital flexor muscle has fast contracting properties that render it susceptible to fatigue.Conclusion: Based on these measurements and supporting evidence from the literature, it is proposed that overloading of the superficial digital flexor tendon results from fatigue of the synergistic, faster contracting deep digital flexor muscle.Potential relevance: Future research investigating distal limb system function as a whole should help refine clinical diagnostic procedures and exercise training approaches that will lead to more effective prevention and treatment of digital flexor tendon injuries in equine athletes.									18	0	0	17	0	19			0425-1644			WOS:000250909500012	18065313	
J	Jerzmanowski, Michal								Total factor productivity differences: Appropriate technology vs. efficiency								EUROPEAN ECONOMIC REVIEW				51	8			2080	2110		10.1016/j.euroecorev.2006.12.005			NOV 2007	2007	Recent development and growth accounting studies have established that total factor productivity is an important source of cross-country differences in income levels and growth rates. This paper makes two contributions. First, it examines the sensitivity of the development accounting results to the Cobb-Douglas specification of the production function. Second, within the Cobb-Douglas framework, it weighs evidence of the two alternative explanations of total factor productivity differences: the inefficiency view and the appropriate technology view. To accomplish these tasks, the world production frontier is estimated using a nonparametric deterministic approach known as data envelopment analysis. I find that the fraction of income differences explained by physical and human capital increases from 32% to 55% when departing from the Cobb-Douglas assumption. There is also evidence consistent with the appropriate technology view; countries with an inadequate mix of inputs are unable to access the most productive technologies. Moreover, the world technology frontier appears to be shifting out faster at input combinations close to that of the R&D leader. However, inefficiency appears to be the main explanation for low incomes throughout the world; it explains 43% of output variation in 1995, and its importance has increased over time.

J	Yoder, Jay A.; Tank, Justin L.; Brown, Bryan L.; Hobbs, Horton H., III				Brown, Bryan/D-9726-2014				Water exchange pertaining to host attachment sites and stream preference in crayfish-associated branchiobdellids, Cambarincola fallax and Cambarincola ingens (Annelida : Clitellata)								HYDROBIOLOGIA				592				523	533		10.1007/s10750-007-0796-1			NOV 2007	2007	Water balance profiles were constructed for adults of two branchiobdellid species ( Cambarincola fallax and Cambarincola ingens) to examine how they are differentially adapted for a freshwater habitat on different crayfish hosts. Both exhibited a high ( 75%) body water content and high net transpiration rate, reflecting that they are hyperosmotic to freshwater and display a consistent strategy that emphasizes water loss. In contrast to C. ingens, C. fallax was 6x smaller in body size, lost water 2x faster, and had heightened activation energy ( Ea) for water permeability. Thus, C. fallax relies on high net transpiration rate with a focus on elimination, whereas the larger C. ingens are modified for water retention and rely on their low activation energy to suppress the amount of water that enters the body. Neither species showed evidence of a critical transition temperature ( CTT), as indicated by an uninterrupted Boltzmann temperature function of passive water loss rates. No influence on favoring water balance was apparent in relation to the crayfish host with regard to preferred attachment sites ( subrostral or branchial chamber) or preference for occupying different regions ( pool vs. riffle) of the stream. Thus, water balance strategies between the two species are complementary, reflecting trade- offs that adjust for body size to promote survival in similar freshwater habitats. The ability of C. ingens and C. fallax to survive with a low water content, down to nearly 1/ 2 their body mass, however, enables them to cope with the excess water by permitting a high rate of water loss.									6	0	0	5	0	6			0018-8158			WOS:000249205000035

The signal voltages on the IC and its package produce electric fields that can couple to cables and other structures attached to the PCB, inducing common-mode currents that can be a primary source of unintentional radiated emissions. The signal currents in the IC and its package produce magnetic fields that can also result in common-mode currents on larger radiating structures. This paper describes a TEM cell measurement method employing a hybrid to separate the electric field coupling and the magnetic field coupling. The results of this measurement can be used to determine the product of the IC's self-capacitance and the effective voltage that drives this capacitance. This voltage-capacitance product characterizes the IC's ability to drive common-mode currents onto cables or enclosures due to electric field coupling. This information can then be used to estimate the resulting radiated emissions.									11	0	0	0	0	11			0018-9375			WOS:000251295500006

On the detection of clones in sensor networks using random key predistribution								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS PART C-APPLICATIONS AND REVIEWS				37	6			1246	1258		10.1109/TSMCC.2007.905824			NOV 2007	2007	Random key predistribution security schemes are well suited for use in sensor networks due to their low overhead. However, the security of a network using predistributed keys can be compromised by cloning attacks. In this attack, an adversary breaks into a sensor node, reprograms it, and inserts several copies of the node back into the sensor network. Cloning gives the adversary an easy way to build an army of malicious nodes that can cripple the sensor network. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that a sensor network can use to detect the presence of clones. Keys that are present on the cloned nodes are detected by looking at how often they are used to authenticate nodes in the network. Simulations verify that the proposed method accurately detects the presence of clones in the system and supports their removal. We quantity the extent of false positives and false negatives in the clone detection process.									43	2	0	2	0	44			1094-6977	1558-2442		WOS:000250395300015

Skin bums due to ground pad heating may become a limiting factor for further increase in ablation zone dimensions and generator power. We investigated a method were groups of ground pads are sequentially activated to reduce skin heating.Methods: We compared conventional operation (i.e. simultaneous connection of all pads) to sequentially switched activation of the pads where different pad combinations are active for periods of similar to 0.3 - 8 s. The timing during sequential activation was adjusted to keep the leading edge temperature equal between the pads. We created Finite Element Method computer models of three pads (5 x 5 cm, 1 cm apart) placed in line with the RF electrode on a human thigh to determine differences in tissue heating during simultaneous and sequential ground pad activation. We performed experiments with three ground pads (5 x 10 cm, 4 cm apart) placed on a tissue phantom (1.5 A, 12 min) and measured pad surface and leading edge temperatures.Results: Temperature rise below the leading edge for proximal, middle and distal ground pad in relation to active electrode location was 5.9 degrees C +/- 0.1 degrees C, 0.8 degrees C +/- 0.1 degrees C and 0.3 degrees C +/- 0.1 degrees C for conventional operation, and 3.3 degrees C +/- 0.1 degrees C, 3.4 degrees C +/- 0.2 degrees C and 3.4 degrees C +/- 0.2 degrees C for sequentially activated operation in the experiments (p<0.001).Conclusion: Sequential activation of multiple ground pads resulted in reduced maximum tissue temperature. This may reduce the incidence of ground pad bums and may allow higher power RF generators.									7	2	0	2	0	10			0265-6736	1464-5157		WOS:000251885600002	18038286

The Moneyball anomaly and payroll efficiency: A further investigation								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPORT FINANCE				2	4			177	189					NOV 2007	2007	In our 2006 paper, we examined the implications of Michael Lewis' book for the labor market in Major League Baseball. Our tests provided econometric support for Lewis' claim of mis-pricing in the baseball labor market's valuation of batting skills. We also found suggestive evidence that the dispersion of statistical knowledge throughout baseball organizations was associated with a sharp attenuation of the mis-pricing. This paper takes a closer look at the economic issues raised. by Lewis for the baseball labor market. We extend the sample both backward and forward in time, seeking to determine how long the pricing anomaly existed, and whether the recent attenuation in the anomaly is robust to new observations. In addition, we refine the measures of skill used in our tests to more closely match the narrative account in Lewis' book. Using both our earlier and refined measures, we find that the pricing anomaly extends well before the period described in Moneyball, and that with some important caveats, the market correction in the post-Moneyball period persists. Finally, improvements in personnel management associated with a closer link between pay and performance may be responsible for the sharply increased correlation between winning percentage and payroll in recent years.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1558-6235			WOS:000258955200002

The linear viscoelastic behavior of a series of 3-hydroxybutyrate-based copolymers								INTERNATIONAL POLYMER PROCESSING				22	5			455	462					NOV 2007	2007	The thermal and linear viscoelastic behavior of a series of synthetically produced 3-hydroxybutyrate-based copolymers is reported. The comonomers employed include 4-hydroxybutyrate (4HB), 5-hydroxyvalerate (5HV), and 6-hydroxyhexanoate (6HH). The polymers investigated differed in the concentration of comonomer randomly distributed within the material and in the length of the carbon backbone of the comonomer The glass transition temperature follows the Fox equation and decreases with increasing comonomer concentration. The molecular weight between entanglements M, was determined from the linear viscoelastic data for each copolymer and a mixing rule was used to determine Me for homopolymers made from the comonomers studied. Depending on comonomer type and concentration, M, can be varied systematically, resulting in a wide range of potential applications depending on the chemistry employed. Using the complex viscosity data, master curves were constructed for both the zero-shear viscosity and the shear-thinning behavior depending upon the temperature and the molecular weight between entanglements. The analysis of rheological results and polymer properties based upon copolymer content provides an opportunity to process bio-based materials for a wide range of applications.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0930-777X			WOS:000250851800011

Measurement of SDF by Mie scattering usually involves solving the Fredholm integral equations of the first kind based on discrete inputs with uncertainties (e.g.. extinction measurements at multiple wavelengths or at multiple angles). A set of inputs which are not mutually independent within the measurement error implies that redundancy exists in the measurements and not all the measurements provide useful information for solving the integral equations. To avoid such redundancy, this paper develops a method to analyze the dependency among the kernel functions associated with Mie scattering. Applications of this method are demonstrated and the results provide valuable insights into the optimization of SDF measurement based on Mie scattering, in terms of minimizing the number of measurements needed and revealing the optimal wavelengths and angles to perform the measurements.

J	Ulbrich, Carlton W.; Atlas, David								Microphysics of raindrop size spectra: Tropical continental and maritime storms								JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY				46	11			1777	1791		10.1175/2007JAMC1649.1			NOV 2007	2007	This work uses raindrop size spectra measured at the surface in tropical continental storms to determine the associated parameters of the best-fit gamma distributions. The physical processes responsible for those parameters and their relations to the measurable radar reflectivity Z and differential reflectivity ZDR are then explored. So too are their relations to quantitative measurements of rain. Comparison is then made with corresponding features previously reported in tropical maritime regimes. The storms observed in Brazil and Arecibo, Puerto Rico, have been divided into convective (C), transition (T), and stratiform (S) segments. The raindrop size distribution (DSD) parameters are clearly defined on a gamma parameter diagram (GPD) that shows 1) how median volume drop size D-0 increases from S to T to C segments of the rain while 2) the range of the spectrum breadth parameter mu increases, and the range of the slope parameter Lambda decreases in the same sequence of S to C. Drop growth occurs predominantly below the 0 degrees C level by collision, coalescence, and breakup in the C rains. The median volume diameter D-0 grows as more of the water is concentrated near that size and so the DSD narrows; that is, both mu and Lambda increase. In both maritime and continental storms the DSD in the convective portion of the storm approaches equilibrium. The coefficient A in the Z = AR(b) relation increases with D-0 while the exponent b approaches unity. The D-0 and A pair increase with, and appear to be determined largely by, the updraft strength, thus providing a possible means of determining the appropriate algorithms for rainfall measurement. Although the small drop number samples measured by the surface disdrometer relative to the large volumes sampled by a radar tend to truncate the DSD at both small and large drop sizes, narrow distributions with mu = 5 to 12 cannot be attributed to such an effect. Such narrow DSDs accord with common experience of monodispersed large drops at the beginning of a convective storm. There is also remarkable agreement of the surface-based observations of ZDR-Z-D-0 with the time-space variations from C to T to S rain types observed by radar in England and elsewhere. Because the C region of a storm often accounts for a major share of the rain accumulation despite its shorter duration, it is particularly important to measure that region more accurately. There are distinctive clusters of the generalized number parameter N-W versus D-0 between maritime and continental storms. Methods for remote sensing and parameterization must partition the rainstorms into convective, transition, and stratiform segments.									47	3	0	3	0	50			1558-8424			WOS:000251626900006

Chocolate milk and the Hispanic consumer								JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE				72	9			S666	S675		10.1111/j.1750-3841.2007.00559.x			NOV-DEC 2007	2007	The U.S. Hispanic population is increasing, and purchasing power of this group is also increasing. Little is known about the attributes and preferences of Hispanic adults or children toward chocolate milk. The objective of this study was to understand Hispanic consumer attitudes and preferences for chocolate milk. Focus groups with Hispanic adults (> 18 y, 3 groups, n =31) and children (10 to 14 y, 6 groups, n = 29) were conducted to gain qualitative insight into perceptions and consumption trends. Using focus group results and descriptive analysis profiles of chocolate milks, 5 representative chocolate milks were selected for quantitative consumer testing. Milks were evaluated for overall liking and other attributes by Hispanic adults (n = 79), Caucasian adults (n = 91), and Hispanic children (n = 45). Analysis of variance and internal and external preference mapping were conducted to characterize differences among treatments and ethnic groups. Chocolate milks were differentiated by descriptive analysis (P < 0.001) in visual, flavor, and mouthfeel attributes. Hispanic children (n = 45) rated all chocolate milks higher in liking than Hispanic or Caucasian adults, and documented significant differences in liking for milks evaluated (P < 0.05). Caucasians adults were generally more discriminatory in liking of chocolate milks than Hispanic adults, but consistent ethnic differences were observed only for chocolate flavor liking where Hispanics assigned higher drivers for these clusters were largely consistent with previous chocolate milk consumer studies in that many of the same key drivers of liking for chocolate milk were identified. The results indicated that these consumer clusters were not defined exclusively by ethnicity.									10	0	0	5	0	10			0022-1147			WOS:000251394600052	18034752	
J	Luo, Jian				Luo, Jian/A-4777-2008				Modeling dissimilar optical fiber splices with substantial diffusion								JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY				25	11			3575	3579		10.1109/JLT.2007.907788			NOV 2007	2007	Optical losses of dissimilar fiber fusion splices are modeled using a combination of diffusion simulation and beam propagation method; open-source codes are provided. It is demonstrated that an optimal amount of diffusion is required to achieve the minimum splice loss. Additional annealing beyond the optimal level is detrimental. Furthermore, oscillation of splice loss with the geometrical parameters of the heat zone due to an optical interference effect is revealed, which can be intentionally utilized to reduce dissimilar fiber splice losses. Understanding these diffusion-related splice loss mechanisms is important for splicing process optimization, as well as design of fusion splicers and novel postsplicing heat treatment devices.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0733-8724			WOS:000251462200038

B2B seller competence: Construct development and measurement using a supply chain strategy lens								JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT				25	6			1311	1331		10.1016/j.jom.2007.01.007			NOV 2007	2007	In less than a decade, Internet-enabled business-to-business (B2B) commerce has become central to supply chain management. But little is known about the infrastructural competencies required for manufacturers engaged in Internet-enabled activities with downstream business customers. This paper aims to take a first step in operationalizing a set of new, multi-item measures that tap into infrastructural (or "soft") competencies required for leveraging B2B commerce.We use a structured, two-stage approach to develop and refine a set of constructs, items, and new multi-item measurement scales in order to rigorously evaluate their measurement properties. By drawing upon the literature as well as extensive interviews with expert practitioners, we define and measure the salient infrastructural competencies - termed B2B seller competence (B2B-SC) associated with the seller-side of Internet-enabled commerce. We find that the conceptual domain of B2B-SC comprises seven theoretically important dimensions: (1) technical skills, (2) change disposition, (3) conflict management, (4) market acuity, (5) coordinated logistics, (6) knowledge channels, and (7) fluid partnering. Operational indicators that tap into constructs pertaining to each B2B-SC dimension are developed through an iterative process.In the second stage, we conduct a field study to more fully assess the measurement properties of item and scale reliability and validity using a covariance structure framework. The results indicate that our new scales exhibit sufficient psychometric properties, which make them useful for theory building, testing, and the refinement of supply chain strategy paradigms in the emerging area of B2B commerce.

J	Klein, Richard								Customization and real time information access in integrated eBusiness supply chain relationships								JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT				25	6			1366	1381		10.1016/j.jom.2007.03.001			NOV 2007	2007	eBusiness enabled information systems and technology have proliferated with the diffusion and technological advances of the Internet. This research examines supply chain management relationships between service providers and clients, focusing on the performance impacts of (1) the level of customization implemented by clients using vendor provided eBusiness solutions and (2) the subsequent real time access achieved with respect to operational information maintained by vendors. The study also focuses on the impacts of the provider's information exchange behavior and both parties' level of trust. Using dyadic data collected from a logistics services provider and 91 clients, findings show that the level of customization and real time information access has a direct positive impact on performance outcomes realized by both. Additionally, results demonstrate that provider's level of trust in the client positively influences their information exchange behavior, and in turn, information exchange behavior positively impacts client customizations.

In the current study, the authors use this technology to confer resistance to plum pox virus (PPV) in herbaceous and woody perennial plants by silencing the PPV-coat protein (CP) gene. The authors confirmed the high capacity of ihpRNA constructs for inducing RNA silencing in Nicotiana benthamiana Domin., as more than 75% of the transformants displayed PTGS as evaluated by specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) production. The authors demonstrated that ihpRNA constructs provided PPV resistance, and they found a correlation between the length of the PPV sequence introduced in the ihpRNNA constructs and the frequency of transgenic-resistant plants. Plants transformed with the full-length sequence produced a higher percentage of resistant lines. The authors further demonstrated for the first time that ihpRNA technology is applicable to a woody perennial species. A transgenic plum (Prunus domestica L.) PPV-CP ihpRNA line showed gene silencing characteristics (hype rm ethyl ation of the transgene sequence and specific siRNA production) and resistance to PPV infection 16 months after inoculation.									38	4	0	34	0	43			0003-1062			WOS:000251118500015

The coordination of assembly operations and supervisory control demands familiarity with mechanical and electrical design, instrumentation, actuators, and computer programming for successful system development. This paper presents an educational mechatronics laboratory that encourages multi -disciplinary hands-on engineering discovery within team settings. Three focused progressive experiments are reviewed that allow students to program and operate a programmable logic controller, a traditional conveyor system, and a distributed servo-motor based conveyor. The students also program and implement two robotic arms for material handling applications. The equipment, learning objectives, and experimental methodology for each laboratory are discussed to offer insight. A collaborative design project case study is presented in which student teams create a smart material handling system. Overall, engineering graduates have generally been required to learn material handling and other multidisciplinary concepts in the field, and therefore, a well-rounded engineering curriculum should incorporate mechatronics in both the classroom and laboratory.

Here we report evidence that asymmetries in the homologues to Broca's and Wernicke's areas are associated with handedness for tool use in chimpanzees. These results suggest that the neural substrates of tool use may have served as a preadaptation for the evolution of language and speech in modern humans.									46	2	0	39	0	48			0956-7976			WOS:000250806900009	17958711

Dissociation constants (K-d) were determined for 11 indicator-Zn(2)L1 complexes, spanning 2 orders of magnitude from 2.8 x 10(-4) M (alizarin red S) to 2.7 x 10(-6) M (bromo pyrogallol red): Phosphate and pyrophosphate were tested for their ability to displace bound indicator and produce a detectable colorimetric response. Three indicators (bromo pyrogallol red, mordant blue 9, and zincon) complex to Zn(2)L1 to form an indicator displacement assay selective for pyrophosphate over phosphate. Because selection of an indicator/analyte pair having appropriate relative Kd values is critical for their successful application in IDAs, the binding data for these 11 indicators should assist their extension to IDAs for other analytes.									34	2	0	8	1	35			0020-1669			WOS:000250345400035	17915862

We show that scattering loss arising from sidewall roughness can be significantly reduced without compromising the high-index-contrast condition, by inserting thin GRIN cladding layers with refractive indices intermediate between the core and topmost cover of a strip waveguide. Loss as low as 1.5 dB/cm is achieved in small core (1.6 mu m x 0.35 mu m), high-index-contrast (Delta n = 1.37) arsenic-based sulfide strip waveguides. This GRIN cladding design is generally applicable to HIC waveguide systems such as Si/SiO(2). (C) 2007 Optical Society of America.									19	1	0	0	0	20			1094-4087			WOS:000251223400032	19550736

Rare gas collisions with molten metal surfaces								JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS				127	16					164714	10.1063/1.2786073			OCT 28 2007	2007	Newly available experimental data for the scattering of argon, neon, and xenon atoms from molten gallium, indium, and bismuth surfaces are compared to calculations with classical scattering theory. The results of the theory are in reasonable agreement with observed energy-resolved spectra taken at fixed angles, with in-plane angular distributions, and with the first available out-of-plane angular distribution spectra for these systems. For all three of the rare gases, scattering from liquid Ga required the use of an effective surface mass equal to 1.65 times the mass of a single Ga atom. The need for a larger effective mass has been noted previously for Ar/Ga scattering and is indicative of collective effects in the liquid Ga. Comparisons with data taken at low incident energies enable estimates of the physisorption well depth in the interaction potentials for many of the gas-metal combinations.

For large molecules, such as proteins, this is problematic because systems tend to become trapped in local energy minima. The extensively used replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulation technique overcomes this kinetic-trapping problem by allowing Boltzmann-weighted configuration exchange processes to occur between numerous thermally adjacent and compositionally identical simulations that are thermostated at sequentially higher temperatures. While the REMD method provides much better sampling than conventional MD, there are two substantial difficulties that are inherent in its application: (1) the large number of replicas that must be used to span a designated temperature range and (2) the subsequent long time required for configurations sampled at high temperatures to exchange down for potential inclusion within the low-temperature ensemble of interest. In this work, a new method based on temperature intervals with global energy reassignment (TIGER) is presented that overcomes both of these problems. A TIGER simulation is conducted as a series of short heating-sampling-quenching cycles. At the end of each cycle, the potential energies of all replicas are simultaneously compared at the same temperature using a Metropolis sampling method and then globally reassigned to the designated temperature levels. TIGER is compared with regular MD and REMD methods for the alanine dipeptide in water. The results indicate that TIGER increases sampling efficiency while substantially reducing the number of central processing units required for a comparable conventional REMD simulation.

J	Suwannakarn, Kaewta; Lotero, Edgar; Goodwin, James G., Jr.								Solid bronsted acid catalysis in the gas-phase esterification of acetic acid								INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH				46	22			7050	7056		10.1021/ie070536u			OCT 24 2007	2007	Solid acid catalysts are attractive replacements for liquid mineral acids for esterification reactions, where ester products are important for end products that are as diverse as perfumes and biofuels. Although the mechanism of homogeneous esterification has long been known, the mechanistic pathways for esterification over heterogeneous catalysts are still being pursued. This paper presents the results of an investigation into the mechanism of gas-phase esterification in the temperature range of 90-140 degrees C for a simple carboxylic acid (acetic acid) and short-chain alcohols (methanol and ethanol) that have been catalyzed by a solid catalyst with only Bronsted acid sites (silica-supported Nafion, SAC- 13). In this study, evidence from pyridine poisoning experiments suggests that the esterification proceeds via a single site mechanism on solid Bronsted acid catalysts such as SAC-13, as has also been concluded for reaction in the liquid phase at temperatures of :560 degrees C. Based on initial rate data for methanol reaction, the order of reaction for acetic acid shifted only from 0.7 to 0.9 as the temperature changed from 90 degrees C to 130 degrees C. However, the order of reaction for methanol shifted from 0.2 to -0.9 for the same temperature range. The results for the ethanol reaction were similar. Based on these outcomes, the reaction most probably happens between adsorbed acetic acid molecules on the active sites of the catalyst and alcohol molecules from the bulk fluid. However, as the temperature increases from 90 degrees C to 130 degrees C, the rate-limiting step becomes acetic acid adsorption. The reaction is also hindered by the competitive adsorption of the alcohol on the acid sites of the catalyst. Experiments that involve the preadsorption of reactants offered further evidence of the inhibiting effect of the alcohol and the change in the rate-controlling step for reaction at temperatures of > 100 degrees C.									17	0	0	1	0	17			0888-5885			WOS:000250260600003

Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) originally emerged as a technique to study electromechanical phenomena in ferroelectric materials, and in recent years has been employed to study a broad range of non-ferroelectric polar materials, including piezoelectric biomaterials. At the same time, the technique has been extended from ambient to liquid imaging on model ferroelectric systems. Here, we present results on local electromechanical probing of several model cellular and biomolecular systems, including insulin and lysozyme amyloid fibrils, breast adenocarcinoma cells, and bacteriorhodopsin in a liquid environment. The specific features of PFM operation in liquid are delineated and bottlenecks on the route towards nanometre-resolution electromechanical imaging of biological systems are identified.

Vector properties of the beam under strong focusing conditions were observed by comparing the fluorescence images corresponding to the focal intensity distribution for both radial and azimuthal polarizations.

Both receptors are expressed on endothelial cells during angiogenesis. We sought to determine whether one could inhibit angiogenesis by interfering with the binding of these receptors to their endogenous ligands. Here, we show that wild-type PA inhibits both vascular endothelial growth factor-induced and basic fibroblast growth factorinduced angiogenesis at moderate but statistically significant levels. Structure-activity studies identified a PA mutant that exhibited markedly enhanced inhibition of angiogenesis and also inhibited tumor growth in vivo. This mutant, PA(SSSR), is unable to undergo normal cellular processing and, thus, remains bound to the surface receptor. Further mutation of PA(SSSR) So that it does not bind to these cell surface receptors abolished its ability to inhibit angiogenesis. We conclude that high-affinity anthrax toxin receptor (ATR) ligands, such as PA and PA(SSSR), are angiogenesis inhibitors and that ATRs are useful targets for antiangiogenic therapy. These results also suggest that endothelial cell-binding proteins from additional pathogens may inhibit angiogenesis and raise the question of the role of such inhibition in pathogenesis.									19	0	0	18	0	19			0008-5472			WOS:000250286300045	17942931

Two UV sources with different spectral outputs and intensities were chosen so that one of them could be used for surface modification and the other could be used for UV sterilization of the PLA films. The results established that the molecular weight of PLA decreased significantly during irradiation from the photografting lamp under atmospheric conditions. Irradiation through a Pyrex container was shown to minimize polymer degradation during UV exposure from the photografting lamp. The PLA films UV-irradiated under the sterilization lamp for 12 h revealed a similar reduction in the molecular weight and no change in the surface hydrophilicity. However, significantly less photo-degradation was observed under the sterilization lamp when the samples were held in a Pyrex container.

Level shifts in time series caused by changepoints confound many inference problems and are very important data features. Tests for undocumented changepoints from models that have independent and identically distributed errors are by now well understood. However, most climate series exhibit serial autocorrelation. Monthly, daily, or hourly series may also have periodic mean structures. This article develops a test for undocumented changepoints for periodic and autocorrelated time series. Classical changepoint tests based on sums of squared errors are modified to take into account series autocorrelations and periodicities. The methods are applied in the analyses of two climate series.									47	2	0	6	0	49			0894-8755			WOS:000250105900011

Experimental variables in the synthesis of brookite phase TiO2 nanoparticles								MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING				467	1-2			146	149		10.1016/j.msea.2007.02.092			OCT 15 2007	2007	Nanocrystalline brookite titanium dioxide particles have been prepared under ambient condition sol process. Titanium tetrachloride was the precursor in water with isopropanol as the co-solvent in hydrochloric acid. The formed gel mass was peptized and crystallized under refluxing condition. The effect of various parameters, such as temperature, time, water to alcohol ratio, and pH of the sol on the phase obtained were investigated. The refluxing temperature of 83 degrees C with the refluxing time of 15 h led to the formation of pure brookite phase as indicated by X-ray diffractometry (XRD). Whereas, lower temperature of 70 degrees C gave a mixture of rutile and anatase phases, and higher temperature of 100 degrees C gave mixture of rutile and brookite phases. Addition of hydroxypropyl cellulose yielded a more uniform particle size along with higher surface area. The water to alcohol ratio had minimal effect, when taken in the ratio of 1:2 or above, on the brookite phase formation. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Observations of a noctilucent cloud above Logan, Utah (41.7 degrees N, 111.8 degrees W) in 1995								JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES				112	D19					D19203	10.1029/2006JD007158			OCT 11 2007	2007	[1] A Rayleigh-scatter lidar has been operated at the Atmospheric Lidar Observatory (ALO) on the Utah State University (USU) campus (41.7 degrees N, 111.8 degrees W) since August 1993. During the morning of 22 June 1995, lidar returns from a noctilucent cloud (NLC) were observed for approximately 1 hr, well away from the twilight periods when NLCs are visible. This detection of an NLC at this latitude shows that the first reported sighting, in 1999 (Wickwar et al., 2002), was not a unique occurrence. This 1995 observation differs from the 1999 one in that temperatures could be deduced. Near the 83-km NLC altitude the temperatures were found to be up to similar to 23 K cooler than the 11-year June climatology for ALO. This analysis shows that these cool temperatures arose, not because the whole profile was cooler, but because of a major temperature oscillation or wave with a 22-km vertical wavelength and a similar to 0.9 km/hr downward phase speed. This large-amplitude wave has many of the characteristics of the diurnal tide. However, the amplitude would have to be enhanced considerably. These lidar observations were supplemented by OH rotational temperature observations from approximately 87 km. These NLC observations equatorward of 50 degrees have been suggested to be significant harbingers of global change. However, if that were the case, the mechanism is more complicated than a simple overall cooling or an increase in water vapor. Accordingly, we propose enhanced generation of gravity waves that would interact with the diurnal tide to produce a large-amplitude wave, the cold phase of which would give rise to low enough temperatures to produce the NLC. The gravity wave source might be orographic in the Mountain West or convective far to the east or south.									4	1	0	0	0	5			0148-0227			WOS:000250219000002

SAFT-LC: An equation of state for predicting liquid-crystalline phase behavior in carbonaceous pitches								INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH				46	21			7018	7026		10.1021/ie070316g			OCT 10 2007	2007	By adding an orientational free-energy term based on Maier-Saupe theory to the statistical associating fluid theory(SAFT) equation, we have developed a versatile equation of state for describing the phase behavior of carbonaceous pitches, a polydisperse class of discotic nematic liquid-crystalline materials that exhibits both thermotropic and lyotropic behavior. SAFT-liquid crystal (SAFT-LC) can be used to describe the phase behavior of carbonaceous pitches both at conditions where orientational effects are relatively minor (i.e., isotropic liquid-liquid equilibria in the presence of solvent) and at conditions where such effects dominate (e.g., the effect of pitch composition on the isotropic/nematic phase transition). SAFT-LC contains five well-behaved, adjustable parameters: three in SAFT for defining the binary interaction parameters and two in LC for describing the clearing temperature of a pitch pseudocomponent. Predictions of SAFT-LC for phase densities, product yields, and mesophase percentages obtained via a supercritical extraction process for producing mesophase pitch were found to be in reasonable agreement with experiment. In addition, the experimentally observed ability of high molecular weight, 100% mesophase pitches to dissolve up to 20 wt % toluene without phase separation was predicted.					1st Mediterranean Congress on Chemical Engineering for the Environment1st Mediterranean Congress on Chemical Engineering for the Environment	OCT, 2006OCT, 2006	Grp Univ Researchers Chem Engn Italy; Italian Assoc Chem EngineersGrp Univ Researchers Chem Engn Italy; Italian Assoc Chem Engineers	Venice, ITALYVenice, ITALY	7	0	0	0	0	7			0888-5885			WOS:000249987400053

Here, we investigated the effects of CB2-receptor activation on TNF-alpha-induced signal transduction in human coronary artery endothelial cells in vitro and on endotoxin-induced vascular inflammatory response in vivo. TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappa B and RhoA activation and upregulation of adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, increased expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein, enhanced transendothelial migration of monocytes, and augmented monocyte-endothelial adhesion. Remarkably, all of the above-mentioned effects of TNF-alpha were attenuated by CB2 agonists. CB2 agonists also decreased the TNF-alpha- and/or endotoxin-induced ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression in isolated aortas and the adhesion of monocytes to aortic vascular endothelium. CB1 and CB2 receptors were detectable in human coronary artery endothelial cells by Western blotting, RT-PCR, real-time PCR, and immunofluorescence staining. Because the above-mentioned TNF-alpha-induced phenotypic changes are critical in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis and restenosis, our findings suggest that targeting CB2 receptors on endothelial cells may offer a novel approach in the treatment of these pathologies.									128	3	0	113	0	132			0363-6135			WOS:000250058400024	17660390

As the supernova shock accelerates through these layers, it makes them expand so rapidly that free nucleons remain in disequilibrium with alpha-particles throughout most of the expansion. This allows heavy r-process isotopes including the actinides to form in spite of the very low initial neutron excess of the matter. We estimate that yields of heavy r-process nuclei from this site may be sufficient to explain the Galactic inventory of these isotopes.									44	4	1	0	0	46			0004-637X			WOS:000249700100011

Similar numbers of occlusion bodies (OBs) of PxGV and PxMNPV were required to kill P. xylostella. However, cadavers of insects infected with PxGV contained more OBs per unit weight than did cadavers infected with PxMNPV. Less cadaver material was thus required to kill insects with PxGV. Larvae that were killed by PxGV survived approximately 2 d longer than did those killed by PxMNPV. When P. xylostella larvae were fed both viruses together, mortality was higher than that caused by either virus alone. The virulence of PxMNPV produced in P. xylostella did not differ from that of PxMNPV produced in the beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua (Hubner). S. exigua was less susceptible to PxMNPV than to its homologous nucleopolyhedrovirus, SeMNPV.									4	0	0	4	0	4			1386-6141			WOS:000248940400007

Normal embryonic development in the clearnose skate, Raja eglanteria, with experimental observations on artificial insemination								ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES				80	2-3			239	255		10.1007/s10641-007-9219-4			OCT 2007	2007	Clearnose skates, Raja eglanteria, are a common species of skate found seasonally along the Atlantic coast of North America from Cape Cod to mid-Florida and in the Gulf of Mexico from mid-Florida to eastern Texas. Clearnose skates inhabit the west central coast of Florida during winter months, when Gulf temperatures are conducive to mating and egg-laying (approximately 16 degrees C-22 degrees C). Specimens collected during this time will breed in captivity and, if maintained at 20 degrees C, mated females will store sperm and continue to lay fertile eggs for up to six months. With fertile eggs available from day of laying until hatching, the first complete description of batoid elasmobranch embryonic development with a timetable has been established and is presented here. If eggs are maintained at 20 degrees C, appearance and progression of embryonic events proceed over a reproducible timeline. The timeline has been divided into discrete time periods into which developmental events have been grouped. These include cleavage and expansion of the blastodisc (day 1-day 4), embryonic axis and neural tube formation (day 4-day 7), pharyngeal pouches and gill filament development (day 10-day 28), expansion of fins and transition from external filaments to internal gills (week 4-week 7), and epidermal pigmentation and yolk absorption (week 8-week 12). Fully formed offspring hatch after an incubation period of approximately 12 weeks (85 +/- 6 days). To examine possible mechanisms of transport and storage of sperm in the reproductive tract of females following copulation, experiments resulting in the first artificial insemination for any elasmobranch fish are described. These experiments provide evidence for functional roles of the alkaline gland, whose secretions stimulate sperm motility and may enhance migration of sperm to the oviducal glands, and the clasper gland, whose secretions may provide nutrition during storage of viable sperm in the oviducal gland.

They feature peripheral meso-3-cyanophenyl and meso-3,5-cyanophenyl groups, which have previously been shown to undergo transformation into malonates without perturbation of the porphyrin core and subsequent Bingel addition to fullerene C-60. The tetrapyrrolic metal binding sites in the diporphyrin arrays are either complexed to two Zn-II or Cu-II ions, or, in a mixed coordination, to one Cu-II and one Zn-II ion; alternatively, one or both sites remain unoccupied. The interaction between the differentially metallated porphyrin rings was systematically investigated by UV/Vis spectroscopy and electrochemistry. Cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry reveal that electronic communication in the diporphyrin arrays varies strongly with the mode of connection (meso,meso-linked or triply fused), the nature of the bound metal ion, and the number of peripheral cyano groups. The electrochemical HOMO-LUMO gap in both series of diporphyrins is strongly but differentially affected by the choice of the inserted metal ions. (C) Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Experiments were conducted for wind speeds ranging from 1.0 to 4.0 m/s to determine if and how the sigma versus q'' relationship was affected by wind speed. Consistent surfactant coverage conditions were maintained for wind speeds ranging from 1.0 to 2.6 m/s, and these are the focus of the results presented herein. For wind speeds above 2.6 m/s the surfactant was consistently pushed downstream, resulting in an inhomogeneous surface condition for the air/water interface. For wind speeds less than 2.6 m/s the relationship between sigma and q'' is approximately linear and is weakly dependent on wind speed. The surface temperature field was obtained by infrared (IR) imaging. Sample IR images are presented in addition to the sigma versus q'' data. IR images are presented for surfaces covered with insoluble surfactants (liquid phase and solid phase), a soluble surfactant, and a clean water surface.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0723-4864			WOS:000249648400004

Diploid with watermelon pollenizer cultivars differ respect to triploid watermelon yield								HORTTECHNOLOGY				17	4			518	522					OCT-DEC 2007	2007	As triploid watermelons (Citrullus lanatus) increase in popularity, production has shifted away from seeded watermelons. To achieve successful fruit set in triploid watermelons, a diploid watermelon cultivar must be planted as a pollen source. Three diploid cultivars in 2005 and seven diploid cultivars in 2006 were evaluated at one and three locations, respectively, to determine their effectiveness as pollenizers. Each cultivar was planted within plots of the triploid watermelons 'Tri-X 313' (2005) and 'Supercrisp'(2006) with buffers on all sides of the plots to contain pollen flow within individual plots. Performance of pollenizers was based on triploid watermelon yield, soluble solids concentration, and incidence of hollowheart. In 2005, there were no significant differences in total weight, fruit per acre, average weight, or soluble solids concentration among pollenizers. In 2006, significant differences in yield were observed, and plots with 'Sidekick' as a pollenizer yielded the highest but were not significantly different from 'Patron', 'SP-1', 'Jenny', or 'Mickylee'. In 2006, there were no significant differences in fruit per acre, soluble solids concentration, or incidence of hollowheart between pollenizers. The experimental design was successful in isolating pollenizers and there was minimal pollen flow outside of experimental plots as indicated by minimal fruit set in control plots.									6	0	0	6	0	6			1063-0198			WOS:000249637600016

Yield and quality of triploid miniwatermelon cultivars and experimental hybrids in diverse environments in the Southeastern United States								HORTTECHNOLOGY				17	4			608	617					OCT-DEC 2007	2007	The goal of this study was to evaluate miniwatermelon (Citrullus lanatus) cultivars/experimental hybrids (cultigens) for yield, quality, and adaptability in various growing environments. Eighteen cultigens were evaluated in field locations at southern Florida (Bradenton), northern Florida (Quincy), central South Carolina (Blackville), coastal South Carolina (Charleston), and eastern North Carolina (Kinston). Fruit at each site were harvested when watermelons in several plots were at market maturity. Fruit were categorized as marketable if they weighed between 3.0 and 9.0 lb. Fruit were categorized by size as follows: <= 3.0 lb (cull), 3.1-5.0 lb, 5.1-7.0 lb, 7.1-9.0 lb, and >= 9.1 lb (cull). Fruit were graded according to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) grading standards for all watermelon fruit. We found that eight cultigens (Meilhart, Petite Perfection, Precious Petite, Little Deuce Coupe, RWT 8162, Master, Bibo, and Vanessa) were consistently among the top yielding and four cultigens (HA 5138, HA 5117, Petite Treat, and Valdoria) were consistently among the lowest yielding. These had a consistent yield response regardless of location. Within the small marketable melon category (3.1-5.0 lb), 'Bibo', 'Precious Petite', and RWT 8162 produced a uniform fruit over the five locations. Within the medium marketable melon category (5.1-7.0 lb) 'Meilhart', 'Little Deuce Coupe', HA 5109, 'Xite', 'Mohican', SR 8101, and 'Vanessa' produced uniform fruit size over the five locations. HA 5117, HA 5109, 'Extazy', 'Mohican', 'Petite Treat', and 'Valdoria' produced more fruit in the larger category. Those cultigens that produced melons that were consistently >9.0 lb were HA 5138, HA 5117, Bobbie, and Valdoria. The larger USDA marketable class (7.1-9.0 lb) was considered too large to be in the miniwatermelon market. We found five cultigens that provided consistently high soluble solids readings at each location: Master, RWT 8162, Betsy, Bobbie, and Bibo. We sampled only five fruit at each location for internal quality, and found dark seeds in all of the cultigens in at least one of the locations. Rind thickness and fruit shape did not appear to be influenced by test site location.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1063-0198			WOS:000249637600031		
J	Simoneau, Joel B.; Pearson, L. Wilson								Multitone feedback through demodulating log detector for detection of spurious emissions in software radio								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS I-REGULAR PAPERS				54	10			2222	2228		10.1109/TCSI.2007.904674			OCT 2007	2007	This paper provides an analysis of a log detector in order to determine its response to a multitone input for detection of spurious emissions in a radio frequency transmitter. Treatment is given to the single tone response of the log detector and extended to a two-tone log detector system, where a large signal and a small signal are present. The large signal is observed to experience logarithmic processing with an output at zero frequency. The small signal produces an output at the difference frequency of the large signal frequency and small signal frequency that is approximately proportional to the ratio of the small signal voltage to the large signal voltage. The two-tone results are generalized to an m-tone input. Experimental results are presented to show the accuracy of the model. The log detector circuit analyzed is able to detect a spurious emission within 45 MHz of the main signal with +/-1 dB of accuracy.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1549-8328			WOS:000250315100012

Towards friction and adhesion from high modulus microfiber arrays								JOURNAL OF ADHESION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				21	12-13			1297	1315		10.1163/156856107782328344			OCT 2007	2007	Unlike traditional pressure sensitive adhesives, the natural setal arrays of gecko lizards achieve dry adhesion with stiff, keratinous material. This remarkable property has inspired a new class of adhesive and high friction microstructures composed of stiff materials that, like natural setae, have an elastic modulus greater than 1 GPa. In contrast to softer materials, such as rubber and low molecular weight acrylates, stiff materials have the advantage of wear and creep resistance and represent a wide range of polymers, metals, and ceramics that include materials that are also temperature resistant and biocompatible. This work presents progress in the design and fabrication of synthetic gecko adhesives with particular attention to the principles of contact mechanics and elasticity that are essential in formulating accurate design criteria.									38	0	2	4	0	40			0169-4243			WOS:000251189400009

In this study, we investigated the effects of silicon-containing materials (bentonite, diatomeaceous earth, kaolin) on the activity of the gypsy moth nucleopolyhedrovirus LdMNPV, as well as the effect of these materials on the viral enhancement activity of a fluorescent brightener Tinopal LPW. Bentonite (1%), diatomaceous earth (1%), and kaolin (1%) had little effect upon the activity of LdMNPV. Moreover, the addition of bentonite, diatomaceous earth or kaolin to LdMNPV/Tinopal had little effect upon the enhancement activity of Tinopal LPW.									0	0	0	1	0	1			1523-5475			WOS:000207495000001

Ninth- tenth- eleventh-rib composition, muscle color, and palatability								JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE				85	10			2691	2698		10.2527/jas.2006-734			OCT 2007	2007	Angus-cross steers (n = 198; 270 kg; 8 mo) were used in a 3-yr study to assess the effects of winter stocker growth rate and finishing system on 9 10-11th-rib composition, color, and palatability. During the winter months (December to April), steers were randomly allotted to 3 stocker growth rates: low (0.23 kg/d), medium (0.45 kg/d ), or high (0.68 kg/d). At the completion of the stocking phase, steers were allotted randomly within each stocker growth rate to a high concentrate (CONC) or to a pasture ( PAST) finishing system. All steers were finished to an equal time endpoint to minimize confounding due to animal age. At the end of the finishing phase, steers were transported to a commercial packing plant for slaughter and a primal rib (NAMP 107) was removed from 1 side of each carcass. The 9-10-11th-rib section was dissected into lean, fat, and bone, and LM samples were analyzed for palatability and collagen content. Hot carcass weight and 9 -10-11th-rib section weight were greater (P = 0.01) for high than low or medium. Winter stocker growth rate did not alter 9-10-11th rib composition. The percentage of fat-free lean, including the LM and other lean trim, was greater (P = 0.001) for PAST than CONC. Total fat percentage of the 9-10-11th-rib section was 42% lower (P = 0.001) for PAST than CONC due to lower percentages of s. c., intermuscular, and i. m. fat. The percentage of total bone in the 9-10-11th-rib section was greater (P = 0.001) for PAST than CONC. Finishing beef cattle on PAST increased (P = 0.001) the percentage of lean and bone and reduced (P = 0.001) the percentage of fat in the carcass based on published prediction equations from 9-10-11th rib dissection. Stocker growth rate did not influence the objective color scores of LM or s. c. fat. Longissimus muscle color of PAST was darker (lower L*; P = 0.0001) and less red (lower a*; P = 0.002) than CONC. Juiciness scores were greater (P = 0.02) for CONC than PAST. Initial and overall tenderness scores as well as Warner-Bratzler shear force values did not differ (P = 0.28) among finishing systems. Beef flavor intensity was lower (P = 0.0001) and off-flavor intensity greater (P = 0.0001) for PAST than CONC. Total collagen content was greater (P = 0.0005) for PAST than CONC; however, there were no differences in percentage soluble or insoluble collagen. Growth rate during the winter stocker period did not influence rib composition, color, or beef palatability. Finishing steers on forage reduced fat percentages in the rib and LM without altering tenderness of beef steaks.									22	0	0	19	0	22			0021-8812			WOS:000249557700035	17644782	
J	Corriher, V. A.; Hill, G. M.; Andrae, J. G.; Froetschel, M. A.; Mullinix, B. G., Jr.								Cow and calf performance on Coastal or Tifton 85 Bermudagrass pastures with aeschynomene creep-grazing paddocks								JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE				85	10			2762	2771		10.2527/jas.2007-0015			OCT 2007	2007	Cow and calf performance was determined in a 2-yr, 2 x 2 factorial, grazing experiment using Coastal or Tifton 85 (T85) replicated Bermudagrass pastures (4 pastures each; each pasture 4.86 ha), without or with aeschynomene creep-grazing paddocks (n = 4, 0.202 ha each, planted in May of each year, 13.44 kg/ha). On June 10, 2004, and June 8, 2005, 96 winter-calving beef "tester" cows and their calves were grouped by cow breed (9 Angus and 3 Polled Hereford/group), initial cowBW(592.9 +/- 70.1 kg, 2-yr mean), age of dam, calf breed (Angus, Polled Hereford, or Angus x Polled Hereford), calf sex, initial calf age (117 +/- 20.1 d, 2-yr mean), and initial calf BW (161.3 +/- 30.4 kg) and were randomly assigned to pastures. Additional cow-calf pairs and open cows were added as the forage increased during the season. Forage mass was similar for all treatment pastures (P > 0.70; 2-yr mean, 6,939 vs. 6,628 kg/ha, Coastal vs. T85; 6,664 vs. 6,896 kg/ha, no creep grazing vs. creep grazing). Main effect interactions did not occur for performance variables ( P > 0.10; 2-yr means), and year affected only the initial and final BW of the calves and cows. The 91-d tester calf ADG was greater for calves grazing T85 than Coastal (0.94 vs. 0.79 kg; P < 0.01), and for calves creep grazing aeschynomene compared with calves without creep grazing (0.90 vs. 0.82 kg; P < 0.03). Calf 205-d adjusted weaning weights were increased for calves grazing T85 compared with Coastal (252.9 vs. 240.3 kg; P < 0.01) and for calves with access to creep grazing (249.9 vs. 243.3 kg; P < 0.05). The IVDMD of esophageal masticate from pastures had a forage x creep grazing interaction (P < 0.05; Coastal, no creep grazing = 57.4%; Coastal, creep grazing = 52.1%; T85, no creep grazing = 59.1%; T85, creep grazing = 60.0%), and IVDMD was greater ( P < 0.05) for T85 than for Coastal pastures. Cows were milked in August 2004, and in June and August 2005, with variable milk yields on treatments, but increased milk protein (P < 0.05) for cows grazing T85 compared with Coastal pastures in August each year, contributing to increased calf gains on T85 pastures. These results complement previous research with T85 and indicate increased forage quality and performance of cattle grazing T85 pastures. Calf gains on T85 pastures and for calves on creep-grazed aeschynomene paddocks were high enough to influence the efficiency of cow-calf operations.									8	0	0	7	1	9			0021-8812			WOS:000249557700043	17526661

Morphometric relationship of length-weight and chelae length-width of eastern white river crayfish (Procambarus acutus acutus, Girard, 1852), under culture conditions								JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY				23	5			616	620		10.1111/j.1439-0426.2007.01015.x			OCT 2007	2007	Length-weight (TL vs WWT) and chelae length-width (ChL vs ChW) relationships were described for juveniles, males and females, and for form I and form II males of Procambarus acutus acutus. The length-weight relationships for juveniles, form I, form II males, and females could be described as: WWT = 5 x 10(-3) TL3.09, WWT = 6 x 10(-3) TL3.61, WWT = 6 x 10(-9) TL3.26, and WWT = 6 x 10(-4) TL3.5, respectively. In all forms, growth was allometric (P < 0.05). The ANCOVA test indicated that slopes and intercepts of the length-weight regressions were significantly different between sex and sexual stages. The regressions for chelae length-width relationships for form I and form II males, and females were: ChW = -0.81 + 0.27CL, ChW = -0.33 + 0.25CL, and ChW = -0.82 + 0.32CL, respectively. Although the slope and intercepts of regressions for ChL and ChW were similar for those of form I and form II males, the slopes and intercepts of regressions of females were significantly different from form I and form II males. No statistical difference was observed in mean ChL between form II males and females (P > 0.05), but a significant difference was detected in mean ChL between form I and form II males (P < 0.05) and form I and females (P < 0.05). Form I males had longer ChL than form II males and females. The same trend was observed in mean ChW for form I and form II males, but a significant difference was detected between form II males and females (P < 0.05). In addition, results indicated that chelae lengths and widths increased allometrically with total length (TL) for both sex and sexual stages.									5	0	0	6	0	6			0175-8659			WOS:000249429700014		
J	Taylor, Summer Smith								Comments on lab reports by mechanical engineering teaching assistants - Typical practices and effects of using a grading rubric								JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION				21	4			402	424		10.1177/1050651907304024			OCT 2007	2007	Many engineering undergraduates receive their first and perhaps most intensive exposure to engineering communication through writing lab reports in lab courses taught by graduate teaching assistants (TAs). Most of the TAs' teaching of writing happens through their comments on students' lab reports. Technical writing faculty need to be aware of TAs' response practices so they can build on or counteract that instruction as needed. This study examines the response practices of two TAs and the ways the practices shifted after the TAs began using a grading rubric. The analysis reveals distinct patterns in focus and mode, some reflecting best practices and some not. It also indicates encouraging changes after the TAs started using the grading rubric. The TAs' marginalia became more content focused and specific and, perhaps most important, less authoritative and more likely to reflect a coaching mode. The article concludes with implications for technical writing courses.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1050-6519			WOS:000249698400003

J	Bauerle, William L.; Bowden, Joseph D.; Wang, G. Geoff								The influence of temperature on within-canopy acclimation and variation in leaf photosynthesis: spatial acclimation to microclimate gradients among climatically divergent Acer rubrum L. genotypes								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY				58	12			3285	3298		10.1093/jxb/erm177			OCT 2007	2007	Leaf gas exchange and temperature response were measured to assess temperature acclimation within a tree canopy in climatically contrasting genotypes of Acer rubrum L. Over the course of two 50 d continuous periods, growth temperature was controlled within tree crowns and the steady-state rate of leaf gas exchange was measured. Data were then modelled to calculate the influence of genotype variation and vertical distribution of physiological activity on carbon uptake. The maximal rate of Rubisco carboxylation (V-cmax), the maximum rate of electron transport (J(max)), leaf dark respiration rate (R-d), maximum photosynthesis (A(max)), and the CO2 compensation point (Gamma) increased with temperature during both (i) a constant long-term (50 d) daytime temperature or (ii) ambient daytime temperature with short-term temperature control (25-38 degrees C). In addition, within-crown variation in the temperature response of photosynthesis and Rd was influenced by acclimation to local microclimate temperature gradients. Results indicated that carbon uptake estimates could be overestimated by 22-25% if the vertical distribution of temperature gradients is disregarded. Temperature is a major factor driving photosynthetic acclimation and within-crown gas exchange variation. Thus, this study established the importance of including spatial acclimation to temperature and provenance-, ecotype-, and/or genotype-specific parameter sets into carbon uptake models.									25	0	0	23	0	25			0022-0957			WOS:000250677300019	17804430

A field spectroradiorneter was used with the wavelength from 325 to 1075 nm. The Vis/NIR spectra were acquired from 200 samples of tea soft drink. The multivariable analysis concluding partial least squares (PLS) and multiple linear regression (MLR) were applied to build the regression models and seek the fingerprint spectra. The excellent model with high prediction correlation (0.981) was obtained by PLS model based on entire wavelengths. The loading weights of latent variables from PLS model were used to look for the sensitive wavelengths. To evaluate the virtue of these wavelengths, the MLR models were built with these wavelengths. The significance of these wavelengths was analyzed by ANOVA, and five wavelengths (490, 498, 554, 929 and 970 nm) were selected with statistical significance at 99% confidence level. The acceptable result was obtained from MLR model with high prediction correlation (0.975). The potential of Vis/NIRS to predict SSC was ascertained, and the fingerprint spectra, which were strongly related with SSC, were obtained through multivariable analysis. These individual fingerprint wavelengths could be used to exploit a simple, low-cost and efficacious instrument. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The chromatic index of a G-decomposition is the minimum number of colors required to color the parts of the decomposition so that two parts which share a node get different colors. The G-spectrum of H is the set of all chromatic indices taken on by G-decompositions of H. If both S and T are trees, then the S-spectrum of Tconsists of a single value which can be computed in polynomial time. On the other hand, for any fixed tree S, not a single edge, there is a unicyclic host whose S-spectrum has two values, and if the host is allowed to be arbitrary, the S-spectrum can take on arbitrarily many values. Moreover, deciding if an integer k is in the S-spectrum of a general bipartite graph is NP-hard. We show that if G has c > 1 components, then there is a host H whose G-spectrum contains both 3 and 2c + 1. If G is a forest, then there is a tree Twhose G-spectrum contains both 2 and 2c. Furthermore, we determine the complete spectra of both paths and cycles with respect to matchings. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0364-9024			WOS:000249503600001

The means by which these variables affect ratings of interview performance is also investigated. The altruism facet of agreeableness predicted defensive IM behaviors, the vulnerability facet of emotional stability predicted self- and other-focused behaviors, and interview format (behavior description vs. situational questions) predicted self-focused and defensive behaviors. Consistent with theory and research on situational strength, antecedent-IM relations were consistently weaker in a strong situation in which interviewees had an incentive to manage their impressions. There was also evidence that IM partially mediated the effects of personality and interview format on interview performance in the weak situation.					21st Annual Conference of the Society-for-Industrial-and-Organizational-Psychology21st Annual Conference of the Society-for-Industrial-and-Organizational-Psychology	MAY, 2006MAY, 2006	Soc Ind & Org PsycholSoc Ind & Org Psychol	Dallas, TXDallas, TX	31	0	0	0	0	31			0149-2063			WOS:000249873000004

We examine one stream of this research by conducting a meta-analysis of studies that contrast the achievement motivation of entrepreneurs and managers. The results indicate that entrepreneurs exhibit higher achievement motivation than managers and that these differences are influenced by the entrepreneur's venture goals, by the use of U.S. or foreign samples, and, to a less clear extent, by projective or objective instrumentation. Moreover, when the analysis is restricted to venture founders, the difference between entrepreneurs and managers on achievement motivation is substantially larger and the credibility intervals do not include zero.									39	1	0	0	5	45			0047-2778			WOS:000249183000001

Seedlings are difficult to distinguish morphologically, and once grafted, no above ground material is available for visual identification. To avoid misidentification and to protect plant varieties and patents, DNA fingerprinting was investigated as a robust rootstock identification tool. The objective of this study was to distinguish progeny from among seven peach seedling rootstocks: Bailey, Halford, Lovell, Nemaguard, Nemared, Guardian (R) (selection 3-17-7) and S-37. We initially screened 102 Prunus rnicrosatellite (SSR) markers on Lovell, Nemaguard, Nemared and selection 3-17-7. Seventy-five markers showed polymorphism among these rootstocks. The polymorphic markers were then used to screen Bailey, Halford and S-37. Based on the patterns of amplified DNA fragments (two seedlings from each rootstock were tested), eight SSR-markers reproducibly divided the seven rootstocks into as many as five groups. It was necessary to use a multiplex approach to uniquely identify each rootstock because no single SSR locus evaluated thus far was able to differentiate all seven genotypes. To confirm the identity of the SSR markers, we cloned the polymorphic DNA fragments amplified by one of the eight polymorphic SSR primers, which was developed for an AC-enriched sequence isolated from almond. DNA sequence analysis showed that the amplified fragments shared a common AC-enriched repeat with copy number ranging from 5 to 14. Taken together, these results demonstrate that this microsatellite-based DNA fingerprint system has great potential for peach rootstock identification.									5	0	0	4	1	5			1527-3741			WOS:000251068000001

The importance of climbing for juvenile stream gobies is well established, but adult fish in upstream island habitats also face potential downstream displacement by periodic disturbances. Thus, retention of climbing ability could be advantageous for adult stream gobies. Climbing performance might be expected to decline among adults, however, due to the tendency for mass-specific muscular power production to decrease with body size, and a lack of positively allometric growth among structures like the pelvic sucker that support body weight against gravity. To evaluate changes in waterfall-climbing ability with body size in Hawaiian stream gobies, we compared climbing performance and kinematics between adults and juveniles from three species: Awaous guamensis, Sicyopterus stimpsoni and Lentipes concolor. For species in which juveniles climbed using 'powerbursts' of axial undulation, adult performance and kinematics showed marked changes: adult A. guamensis failed to climb, and adult L. concolor used multiple pectoral fin adductions to crutch up surfaces at slow speeds, rather than rapid powerbursts. Adult S. stimpsoni, like juveniles, still used oral and pelvic suckers to 'inch' up surfaces and climbed at speeds comparable to those of juveniles. However, unlike juveniles, adult S. stimpsoni also add pectoral fin crutching to every climbing cycle. Thus, although powerburst species appear to be particularly susceptible to size-related declines in waterfall-climbing performance, the addition of compensatory mechanisms prevents the loss of this novel function in some species.									22	0	0	22	0	22			0952-8369			WOS:000249828800011

We identify three distinct types of employee linkages that must be accommodated in the design of effective incentive systems: (1) outcome linkages, whereby the outcome of one employee's task is influenced by that of another; (2) help linkages, whereby each employee can directly expend effort on helping another; and (3) knowledge linkages, whereby each employee can share job-related knowledge with another. We analytically investigate the effect of each type of employee linkage, and some combinations of these linkages, on the optimal design of incentive systems. Our analytical results demonstrate how, by optimally weighting individual-level and workgroup-level incentives, managers can balance the need to induce cooperation and coordination among employees with the need to manage employees' incentive-related risk. Counter to conventional wisdom, we also demonstrate that both group and individual incentives are necessary to facilitate cooperative behaviors such as knowledge sharing in workgroups. Further, we empirically test some of the insights developed from the analytical models; our empirical findings support these analytical results.									59	5	0	0	0	64			0025-1909			WOS:000250592800002

TBP is based on polymorphism resulting from the PCR-mediated amplification of the first intron in the coding region of the beta-tubulin gene family. Although, the method was successful in genetic assessment of some plant species and varieties, it suffered from low number of molecular markers due to limited variation in the first intron of beta-tubulin gene family. We have now rectified this limitation by introducing the second intron of the beta-tubulin genes as a valuable source of molecular markers. We show that the combined use of the two introns substantially increases the number of molecular markers and results in a reliable assessment of species/varieties relationships. After a preliminary validation on Brassica, this new combinatorial method was tested on species of Eleusine and Arachis. For both, reliable assessment of species relationships were obtained that were consistent with recently published studies resulting from more elaborated methods including DNA sequencing. Combinatorial TBP is a reliable, reproducible, simple, fast, and easy to score method that is very useful for breeding programs and species and variety assessments.									23	0	0	23	1	25			1380-3743			WOS:000248942000005

To examine how historical population size and gene flow patterns within and between loci have influenced lineage divergence in the Hawaiian silversword alliance, we have investigated the nucleotide sequence diversity and divergence patterns of four floral regulatory genes (ASAP1-A, ASAP1-B, ASAP3-A, ASAP3-B) and a structural gene (ASCAB9). Levels and patterns of molecular divergence across these five nuclear loci were estimated between two recently derived species (Dubautia ciliolata and Dubautia arborea) which are presumed to be sibling species. This multilocus analysis of genetic variation, haplotype divergence and historical demography indicates that population expansion and differential gene flow occurred subsequent to the divergence of these two lineages. Moreover, contrasting patterns of allele- sharing for regulatory loci vs. a structural locus between these two sibling species indicate alternative histories of genetic variation and partitioning among loci where alleles of the floral regulatory loci are shared primarily from D. arborea to D. ciliolata and alleles of the structural locus are shared in both directions. Taken together, these results suggest that adaptively radiating species can exhibit contrasting allele migration rates among loci such that allele movement at specific loci may supersede genetic divergence caused by drift and that lineage divergence during adaptive radiation can be associated with population expansion.									27	1	0	26	0	28			0962-1083			WOS:000249829500004	17784920

The usefulness of unit weights in creating composite scores - A literature review, application to content validity, and meta-analysis								ORGANIZATIONAL RESEARCH METHODS				10	4			689	709		10.1177/1094428106294734			OCT 2007	2007	Combining/weighting subscores into an aggregate score involves issues that apply to many fields in the organizational sciences (e.g., weighting predictors in selection, weighting multiple performance appraisal indicators, overall evaluation of organizations). The weights that are used in practice can be different (differential weights) or equal (unit weights). Relevant literature across multiple disciplines and multiple decades is reviewed. The literature indicates that unit weights have substantial predictive validity when compared with regression weights, but there is a lack of data on how other differential weighting strategies (e.g., weights generated by subject matter experts) compare to unit weights. In response, a primary and a meta-analytic study are provided here. The recent literature also contains some potential criticisms of unit weights in regard to personnel selection and content validation-and those statements are evaluated. The data and findings indicate that unit weights can be a highly appropriate approach for weighting under many circumstances.									53	0	0	4	0	53			1094-4281			WOS:000249587900008

Fast filling of these materials is achieved if one sandwiches a slightly permeable sample between highly permeable layers. We derived a useful engineering formula for the front speed as a function of the layer permeability and thickness. An asymptotic analysis of the two-dimensional liquid flow with moving front is performed assuming that the covering layers are much thinner than the sample thickness. It is shown that the front forms sawteeth with the tooth apexes moving along the highly permeable layers. If the surface layers are made of the same material, two sawteeth are mirror symmetric with respect to the sample midplane. The angle which they form drastically depends on the ratio of layer-to-sample permeabilities and on the ratio of skin-to-core thicknesses. The theory presented in this paper can be used to optimize the processes of impregnation of nanostructured materials.

To facilitate those analyses and enhance decision-making and design selection, we propose to decompose the original problem by considering only pairs of criteria at a time, thereby making trade-off evaluation the simplest possible. For the final design integration, we develop a novel coordination mechanism that guarantees that the selected design is also preferred for the original problem. The solution of an overall large-scale problem is therefore reduced to solving a family of bicriteria subproblems and allows designers to effectively use decision-making in merely two dimensions for multicriteria design optimization.									10	0	0	0	0	10			1615-147X	1615-1488		WOS:000255419500002

Batsch] caused by multiple factors; the molecular biology of its tolerance/susceptibility is unknown. The difficulty of studying PTSL is that tree survival or death is not obvious until 3 to 5 years after planting when the symptoms of PTSL first appear. Tolerance to PTSL was unknown in Prunus until the rootstock Guardiang (R) 'BY520-9' was introduced into commercial orchards in 1994. To study the genetics of the response to PTSL, a controlled F-2 cross was made between Guardiang (R) 'BY520-9' selection 3-17-7 (PTSL-tolerant) and Nemaguard (PTSL-susceptible). An F, hybrid was then selfed to generate an F2 population expected to segregate for PTSL response. One hundred fifty-one AFLPs and 21 SSRs, including anchor loci from the Prunus reference genetic map, were used to construct a molecular genetic map based on 100 F2 seedlings. This map covers a genetic distance of 737 cM with an average marker spacing of 4.7 cM and will be used as a framework to construct a highly saturated molecular genetic map. Of the 140 mapped AFLP markers, 38 were associated with PTSL response, as identified previously by bulked segregant analysis. The distribution of the markers associated with PTSL response on the newly constructed genetic map was compared with the recently published Prunus resistance map. This comparison revealed that some resistance gene analogs and several PTSL-associated AFLP markers were located in the same regions in several Prunus linkage groups: G1, G2, G4, G5, and G6. This peach rootstock map can also be viewed and compared with other Prunus maps in comparative map viewer CMap in the Genome Database for Rosaceae (GDR) at http://www. rosaceae.org									22	7	0	18	0	30			1614-2942			WOS:000249752900006

Tribological investigation of the polymer-based lubrication system using a laboratory reciprocating bench test								TRIBOLOGY TRANSACTIONS				50	4			458	465		10.1080/10402000701613203			OCT-DEC 2007	2007	Flooded oil lubrication systems are commonly utilized for many manufacturing processes. However, there is an increasing concern with the flooded lubrication systems due to their biological and environmental impact as well as their maintenance and disposal cost. Polymer-based material, a sponge-like solid lubricant allowing the oil to weep out while in use, provides a promising alternative environmentally benign lubrication solution to satisfy the lubrication requirements for some manufacturing processes. In addition, it can minimize contamination of the coolant system, reduce waste processing and disposal costs, and alleviate the in-plant safety hazard from oil leakage on floor surfaces.The goal of this study is to develop and improve the current lubrication system by applying a polymer-based near-dry lubrication system in order to replace the oil-flooded transfer line lubrication systems currently in production use. Using a laboratory reciprocating bench test based on the design of experiments, this study characterized the tribological performance of the polymer-based lubrication system under a variety of operating conditions, identified the main factor that impacts the tribological performance of the polymer-based lubrication system, and developed a model to predict the wear loss of the polymer based lubricant plate. These results provide the guidelines for possible applications of the polymer-based lubrication system used in the manufacturing process.					3rd World Tribology Congress3rd World Tribology Congress	SEP 12-16, 2005SEP 12-16, 2005	ASMEASME	Washington, DCWashington, DC	1	0	0	0	0	1			1040-2004			WOS:000250684700003

Reduced plant uptake of Cs-137 grown in illite-amended sediments								WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION				185	1-4			255	263		10.1007/s11270-007-9447-4			OCT 2007	2007	Sediments native to the US Department of Energy's Savannah River Site in Aiken, South Carolina are ineffective at binding Cs-137, allowing it to remain available for biological uptake. Unlike the native sediments, illite has inherent characteristics that increase its propensity to sorb Cs-137 in a nearly irreversible manner. The objectives of this study were to determine if the addition of illite to Cs-137-contaminated, native sediments would effectively reduce plant uptake of Cs-137, and to establish the illite concentration most effective in achieving that result. Two plant species, corn and soybean, were grown in native sediments amended with illite at concentrations ranging from 0 to 5%. The illite amendment effectively decreased plant uptake of Cs-137, as concentration ratios (CR; Cs-plant/Cs-soil) for both plants decreased with increasing illite concentration. The 5%-illite treatment induced corn CRs to decrease by 29% and soybean CRs to decrease by 42%. The greatest incremental benefit was observed with an illite amendment of approximately 0.5%.									3	0	0	2	0	3			0049-6979			WOS:000249635700022

The control of Digitaria sanguinalis and Amaranthus palmeri following cover crop incorporation into soil was characterised and fruit yields of bell pepper transplanted into cover crop-amended soil were determined. Differences in glucosinolate concentration and composition were noted between cover crop roots and shoots and among cover crops. Total biomass production by cover crops ranged from 103 g m(-2) for garden cress to 894 g m(-2) for Indian mustard (F-E75), but cover crop biomass was not correlated with D. sanguinalis and A. palmeri control. D. sanguinalis and A. palmeri control in bell pepper varied by cover crop. D. sanguinalis control by cover crops ranged from 38% to 79%, and A. palmeri control was 23% to 48% at 4 weeks after transplanting (WATP) bell pepper in 2004. D. sanguinalis control was positively correlated with total glucosinolate production, but A. palmeri control was not. D. sanguinalis control in 2005 ranged from 0% to 38% at 2 WATP. In the absence of weeds, cover crops did not negatively affect fruit yields which were often higher than in the absence of a cover crop. Glucosinolate-producing cover crops are not a stand-alone weed management strategy, but some will provide early season control of D. sanguinalis and A. palmeri without having a negative effect on transplanted bell pepper.									21	0	0	21	0	21			0043-1737			WOS:000249431000007

As in the case of the unpolarized electron system, sigma(sH) is entirely determined by states at the Fermi level, a property that persists in the presence of magnetic impurities. In the clean limit, the spin- Hall conductivity decreases monotonically with the Zeeman splitting, a result of the ordering effect on the electron spins produced by the magnetic field. In the presence of magnetic impurities, the spin- dependent scattering determines a finite renormalization of the static part of the fully dressed vertex correction of the velocity operator that leads to an enhancement of sigma(sH), an opposite behaviour to that registered in the presence of spin- independent disorder. The variation of sigma(sH) with the strength of the Rashba coupling and the Zeeman splitting is studied.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1367-2630			WOS:000250052100003

In water, the reaction is found to produce spherical nanoparticles of magnetite (Fe(3)O(4)) with a particle size distribution of < 10 to similar to 60 nm. In water with BSA, the reaction produces either nanofibers or nanoneedles, depending on the concentration of BSA. The nanofiber and nanoneedle samples are found to be mixtures of goethite, lepidocrocite, and hematite (alpha-FeOOH, gamma-FeOOH, and alpha-Fe(2)O(3), respectively). The sonochemical reaction of iron pentacarbonyl with BSA in water is thought to proceed through the thermal decomposition mechanism for iron pentacarbonyl with BSA acting as a templating agent.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0743-7463			WOS:000249560100056	17713934

We used mixed copolymer brushes to fabricate responsive nanoparticles and employed the particles to prepare responsive colloidal systems, which demonstrated drastic transformation/switching of material properties upon external stimuli. The interaction between the particles themselves and the particles and their environment can be precisely tuned by a change of solvent and pH. We show that this behavior can be used for a reversible formation of particle aggregates, stabilization and switching between w/o and o/w emulsions, and regulation of the particle transport between immiscible liquids across the interface. We demonstrate an example of the application of the responsive colloids for the fabrication of ultrahydrophobic coatings with textured surfaces from aqueous dispersion, and no surfactant application, using the switching properties of the responsive particles.									90	1	0	5	0	91			1616-301X			WOS:000250018800007

However, the presence of endosymbionts, such as Wolbachia pipientis, within some eukaryotic germlines may facilitate bacterial gene transfers to eukaryotic host genomes. We therefore examined host genomes for evidence of gene transfer events from Wolbachia bacteria to their hosts. We found and confirmed transfers into the genomes of four insect and four nematode species that range from nearly the entire Wolbachia genome (>1 megabase) to short (<500 base pairs) insertions. Potential Wolbachia-to-host transfers were also detected computationally in three additional sequenced insect genomes. We also show that some of these inserted Wolbachia genes are transcribed within eukaryotic cells lacking endosymbionts. Therefore, heritable lateral gene transfer occurs into eukaryotic hosts from their prokaryote symbionts, potentially providing a mechanism for acquisition of new genes and functions.									345	9	4	320	6	368			0036-8075			WOS:000249585900049	17761848

Strategies for improving the solubility, and therefore, the bioavailability of nanomaterials in aqueous solutions are summarized. In particular, the underlining mechanisms of attaching biomacromolecules (DNA, RNA, proteins) and lysophospholipids onto carbon nanotubes and gallic acids onto fullerenes are analyzed. The diffusion and the cellular delivery of RNA-coated carbon nanotubes are characterized using fluorescence microscopy. The translocation of fullerenes across cell membranes is simulated using molecular dynamics to offer new insight into the complex issue of nanotoxicity. To assess the fate of nanomaterials in the environment, the biomodification of lipid-coated carbon nanotubes by the aquatic organism Daphnia magna is discussed. The aim of this paper is to illuminate the need for adopting multidisciplinary approaches in the field study of nanomaterials in biological systems and in the environment.									47	0	0	13	0	47			0953-8984			WOS:000249255300002

As a novel route of chalcogenide glass film patterning, lift-off allows several benefits: leverage with Si-CMOS process compatibility; ability to fabricate single-mode waveguides with core sizes down to submicron range; and reduced sidewall roughness. High-indexcontrast Ge23Sb7S70 strip waveguides have been fabricated using lift-off with excellent uniformity of loss propagation and the lowest loss figure of reported to date. We also show that small core Ge23Sb7S70 rib waveguides can be fabricated via lift-off as well, with loss figures lower than 0.5 dB/cm. Additionally, we find through waveguide modal analysis that although overall transmission loss is low, the predominant source of this loss comes from scattering at the sidewalls.

J	Wan, Xiu-Feng; Chen, Guorong; Luo, Feng; Emch, Michael; Donis, Ruben								A quantitative genotype algorithm reflecting H5N1 Avian influenza niches								BIOINFORMATICS				23	18			2368	2375		10.1093/bioinformatics/btm354			SEP 15 2007	2007	Motivation: Computational genotyping analyses are critical for characterizing molecular evolutionary footprints, thus providing important information for designing the strategies of influenza prevention and control. Most of the current methods that are available are based on multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree construction, which are time consuming and limited by the number of taxa. Arbitrarily defining genotypes further complicates the interpretation of genotyping results. Methods: In this study, we describe a quantitative influenza genotyping algorithm based on the theory of quasispecies. First, the complete composition vector (CCV) was utilized to calculate the pairwise evolutionary distance between genotypes. Next, Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling using the Gibbs Sampling algorithm was applied to identify the segment genotype threshold, which is used to identify influenza segment genotype through a modularity calculation. The viral genotype was defined by combining eight segment genotypes based on the genetic reassortment feature of influenza A viruses. Results: We applied this method for H5N1 avian influenza viruses and identified 107 niches among 283 viruses with a complete genome set. The diversity of viral genotypes, and their correlation with geographic locations suggests that these viruses form local niches after being introduced to a new ecological environment through poultry trade or bird migration. This novel method allows us to define genotypes in a robust, quantitative as well as hierarchical manner.									15	1	0	15	0	18			1367-4803			WOS:000249818700003	17623701

In this study, nanostructures on the (10 (1) over bar4) surfaces of calcite and rhodochrosite are characterized by their surface potentials using Kelvin probe force microscopy. Water-induced nanostructures on calcite have a topographic height of 1.1 (+/- 0.6) nm and an excess surface potential of 126 (+/- 31) mV at 45% relative humidity. The corresponding values for oxygen-induced nanostructures on rhodochrosite at the same RH are 1.3 (+/- 0.7) nm and 271 (+/- 14) mV, respectively. For increasing relative humidity on calcite, the topographic height of the nanostructures increases while their excess surface potential remains unchanged. In comparison, on rhodochrosite the topographic height remains unchanged for increasing relative humidity but excess surface potential decreases. The nonzero excess surface potentials indicate that the nanostructures have compositions different from their parent substrates. The surface-potential heterogeneity associated with the distributed nanostructures has important implications for reactivity in both gaseous and aqueous environments. Taking into consideration such heterogeneities, which are not included in state-of-the-art models, should improve the accuracy of the predictions of contaminant fate and transport in natural environments.									14	1	0	2	0	14			0013-936X			WOS:000249500700034	17948799

Carboxyl modified magnetic nanoparticles were covalently bound with rabbit anti-L. monocytogenes via the amine groups. Several factors, such as the amount of immunomagnetic nanoparticles (IMNPs), reaction and collection times, and washing step, were optimized, and the nanoparticle-based IMS in combination with real-time PCR was further evaluated for detecting L. monocytogenes from artificially contaminated milk. The cell numbers calculated from the means of threshold cycles (C-T) of PCR amplification curves were compared to those from plate counts in order to determine the correspondence degree of quantitative data. The capture efficiency (CE) by plating from IMNP-based IMS was 1.4 to 26 times higher than those of Dynabead (R)-based IMS depending on the initial cell concentrations inoculated into milk samples. When combined with real-time PCR, L. monocytogenes DNA was detected in milk samples with L. monocytogenes >= 10(2) CFU/0.5 ml. In the range of 10(3) to 10(7) L. monocytogenes CFU/0.5 mil, cell numbers calculated from CT values were 1.5 to 7 times higher than those derived from plate counts. Our results demonstrated that both the use of nanoparticles and the choice of anti-L. monocytogenes in our IMNP based IMS in combination with real-time PCR has improved the sensitivity of L. monocytogenes detection from both nutrient broth and milk samples.

This can be seen from the linearization of the equations of motion, and there have also been proofs of ill-posedness for the full nonlinear equations. In the presence of surface tension, the linearized equations no longer exhibit art instability, and it has been believed that the full equations should then be well-posed. In this paper, I sketch a proof that the vortex sheet with surface tension is well-posed in the case of both two- and three-dimensional fluids. The proof in the case of three-dimensional fluids is the joint work with Nader Masmoudi. The method is to first reformulate the problem using suitable variables and parametrizations, and then to perform energy estimates. The choice of variables and parametrizations in the two-dimensional case is the same as that of Hou et al. in a prior numerical work.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1364-503X			WOS:000249100200006	17360269

Ontogenetic scaling of body proportions in waterfall-climbing gobiid fishes from Hawai'i and Dominica: Implications for locomotor function								COPEIA					3			755	764		10.1643/0045-8511(2007)2007[755:OSOBPI]2.0.CO;2			SEP 10 2007	2007	Potential effects of body size changes on locomotor performance in gobiid fishes (family Gobiidae) were studied in two sicydiine species, Sicyopterus stimpsoni from the Hawaiian Islands and Sicydium punctatum from Dominica, West Indies. These taxa both possess a pelvic sucking disc that can be used to adhere to rock surfaces during bouts of waterfall climbing. If this disc scaled isometrically as body size increased, climbing might be impaired in larger fish because body mass increases faster during growth than the area of the sucker that supports body weight. To test whether the pelvic sucker grows in a way that could help maintain climbing performance in large gobies (and that is distinctive compared to other fins), we evaluated the scaling of sucker area, caudal-fin height, and pectoral-fin length with respect to total body length in Sicyopterus and Sicydium across a range of body sizes. Sucker area scaled isometrically with body length for both species, suggesting that climbing performance might decline as these fishes grow. Although the pectoral fin scaled differently in the two species, caudal-fin height showed strong positive allometry relative to body length in both species. The differing scaling patterns of sucker area and caudal-fin height relative to body length may reflect an increase in the importance of swimming over climbing in sicydiine gobies as they grow larger. Moreover, similarities in the scaling patterns of gobies from geographically distant islands suggest that species in this lineage may be subject to common ontogenetic constraints on performance.									19	0	0	19	0	19			0045-8511			WOS:000249487000024

Over a 6 month period, 272 juveniles recruited from a short-term detention facility completed measures assessing sexually-related expectancies in relation to alcohol use and marijuana use as well as measures assessing their actual use of these substances. Repeated measures analyses of sexual risk expectancy measures indicated that the sample as a whole, and older respondents in particular, expected more sexual risk in relation to using alcohol than in relation to using marijuana. Repeated measures analyses of sexual enhancement expectancy measures indicated that Aftican-American and younger respondents expected more sexual enhancement from using marijuana than from using alcohol. Logistic regression analyses indicated that expectancies for sexual enhancement from alcohol use, and expectancies for sexual enhancement from marijuana use, were respectively associated with the use of these substances in a recent sexual incident. Limitations of the study are discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									6	0	0	3	0	6			0306-4603			WOS:000248686900018	17250971

Numerical simulation of octogen-based propellant								AIAA JOURNAL				45	9			2246	2258		10.2514/1.27852			SEP 2007	2007	In this paper, we present a set of computational simulations of the deflagration or composite propellants comprising octogen and hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene. The focus of the investigation is on the parameter calibration of simplified global kinetics models used to determine gas-phase chemical rates. The calibration is based on a collection of experimentally measured burning characteristics for pseudopropellants comprising octogen and hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene with different solid loadings and uses exclusively homogeneous, one-dimensional, steady burning information. The task of including a large set of burning characteristics is accomplished by transforming the calibration into an optimization problem that is solved by means of a genetic algorithm. Models of increasing accuracy are constructed by enlarging the set of matched performance and the parameter space. The objective is to demonstrate the influence of the calibration of such models on three-dimensional simulations in which the size of the oxidizer particles is not. neglected. A quantitative comparison of prediction and experiments is presented.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0001-1452			WOS:000249451700014

In such pathological bladders, uninhibited non-voiding contractions subject bladder cells to cyclic oscillations of intravesical pressure. We hypothesize that cyclic pressure is a potential trigger for tissue remodeling in overactive bladder. Using a custom-made setup, rat bladder smooth muscle cells (SMC) in vitro were exposed to cyclic hydrostatic pressure (40 cm H2O) at either 0.1 Hz or 0.02 Hz frequency for up to 24 h. When compared to static control and cells exposed to 0.02-Hz cyclic pressure, SMC exposed to 0.1-Hz cyclic pressure contained significantly (p < 0.05) higher amounts of DNA. We confirmed that the increase in DNA was due to increased cell proliferation, indicated by increased BrdU incorporation, but not due to decreased apoptosis rates in response to cyclic pressure. In addition, significant (p < 0.05) elevation of Akt phosphorylation in SMC following exposure to cyclic pressure and lack of pressure-induced SMC hyperplasia in the presence of PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002, indicated the involvement of the PI3K/Akt pathway in the proliferative response of SMC to cyclic pressure. We concluded that chronic exposure to intravesical pressure oscillation may be a potential trigger for bladder tissue remodeling.									16	2	0	15	0	18			0090-6964			WOS:000248823800010	17522977

J	Smith, Kelly; Wueste, Daniel; Frugoli, Julia								Using "ethics labs" to set a framework for ethical discussion in an undergraduate science course								BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY EDUCATION				35	5			332	336		10.1002/bambed.94			SEP-OCT 2007	2007	Teaching ethics across the curriculum is a strategy adopted by many universities. One of the fundamental aims of teaching ethics across the curriculum is to get students to see ethics as truly relevant to the subjects they are studying. Ideally, students will come to see that ethics is a thread woven deeply in the fabric of all knowledge and practice. The standard approach, in which students are required to take a separate ethics course, is not especially well suited to this task, but incorporating ethics into science courses presents significant challenges and is likely to meet with resistance, if only because professors in the sciences are often untrained in the teaching of ethics. In an effort to raise the standard of science education as well as comply with a university-wide curricular mandate, we as a team developed the concept of an "ethics lab." We discuss the design of the exercises done during laboratory sections, the training of the graduate students who run the exercises, and the iterations of the exercises over time. We report unanticipated rapid positive outcomes of an attempt to integrate ethics education into a sophomore/junior level science course, Introduction to Genetics.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1470-8175			WOS:000249755400005	21591119

Some studies suggest that exogenous HA likely only transiently contacts and signals cells, and may elicit different cell responses when presented on a substrate (e.g., scaffold surface). To clarify such differences, we used a carbodiimide-based chemistry to tether HA4 onto glass, and compared elastin matrix synthesis by SMCs cultured on these substrates, with those cultured with equivalent amounts of exogenous HA4. Tethered HA4-layers were first characterized for homogeneity, topography, and hydrolytic stability using SEM, XPS, AFM, and FACE. In general, mode of HA4 presentation did not influence its impact on SMC proliferation, or cell synthesis of tropoelastin and matrix elastin, relative to non-HA controls; however, surface-tethered HA4 stimulated SMCs to generate significantly greater amounts of elastin-stabilizing desmosine crosslinks, which partially accounts for the greater resistance to enzymatic breakdown of elastin derived from these cultures. Elastin derived from both sets of cultures contained peptide masses that correspond to the predominant peptides present in rat aortic elastin. SEM and TEM showed that HA4-stimulated fibrillin-mediated elastin matrix deposition, and organization into fibrils. Surface-immobilized HA4 was particularly conducive to organization of elastin into aggregating fibrils, and their networking to form closely woven sheets of elastin fibers, as seen in cardiovascular tissues. The results suggest that incorporation of elastogenic HA4 mers onto cell culture substrates or scaffolds is a better approach than exogenous supplementation for in vitro or in vivo regeneration of architecturally and compositionally faithful-, and more stable mimics of native vascular elastin matrices.

The results showed that the photocatalytic activity of brookite and anatase phase titania samples to be greater than that of Degussa P-25 and rutile phase titania sample. In addition, brookite, due to surface area considerations, appears to be the most photocatalytically active phase of titania.									15	0	0	3	1	15			1011-372X			WOS:000249402900003

In this study eggs of domestic chicken (Gallus domesticus) were dosed with PCB 126 in concentrations of 0.175-0.325 ng/g egg weight. Liver subcellular fractions were analyzed for activities of Phase 1 and Phase 2 biotransformation enzymes 2 and 5 weeks post-hatch. Ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity was increased in both the 2-week and 5-week samples. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity was increased in the 2-week samples only, but the 5-week samples showed an overall much higher GST activity, probably as a result of a still developing enzyme expression in maturing chickens. The same pattern was seen in the phenol-type UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) activity of the control animals. The week two samples showed a positive dose-response relationship for the UGT activity, but after 5 weeks this was reversed, possibly caused by inhibition of hydroxylated PCB metabolites. Phenol-type sulfotransferase (SULT) activities were not significantly correlated with time or dose. There was a strong positive regression between the Ah-receptor mediated EROD and UGT activities. The EROD activities were also positively correlated to the GST activities. Most interesting was a negative correlation between the UGT and SULT activities: an inhibited UGT activity appeared to be compensated by an increased SULT activity. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Trinexapac-ethyl application regimens influence growth, quality, and performance of Bermuda grass and creeping bentgrass putting greens								CROP SCIENCE				47	5			2138	2144		10.2135/cropsci2006.04.0256			SEP-OCT 2007	2007	Dwarf bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon x C. transvaalensis Burtt-Davy) and creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) are planted for golf greens in the U.S. transition zone, but management regimes, such as the use of a plant growth regulator (PGR), often vary for long-term culture of the two species. The objective of this experiment was to investigate application regimens of the PGR trinexapac-ethyl (TE), on growth, quality, and performance of creeping bentgrass and bermudagrass putting greens in Clemson, SC. 'L-93' creeping bentgrass and 'TifEagle' bermudagrass putting greens, established in summer 2002 and mowed at 3.2 mm, received TE over 12 wk in three regimens: 0.017 kg ha(-1) wk(-1), 0.033 kg ha(-1) 2 wk(-1) (biweekly), or 0.05 kg ha(-1) 3 wk(-1) (triweekly) from May to August 2003 and 2004. Creeping bentgrass was not discolored from TE, but unacceptable bermudagrass discoloration (>20%) occurred on one, two, and six dates for weekly, biweekly, and triweekly regimens, respectively. All TE regimens reduced bermudagrass clippings approximately 50% from nontreated bermudagrass across all dates, while creeping bentgrass clipping reductions, approximately 20 to 35% from nontreated grass, were inconsistent. The root masses of both species treated with TE regimens were similar to nontreated turf. Bermudagrass aerification recovery was reduced on two, two, and four dates after weekly, biweekly, and triweekly TE regimens, respectively. All TE regimens increased morning and evening bermudagrass golf ball roll distance approximately 25 cm from morning distances of nontreated turf.									18	0	0	16	3	20			0011-183X			WOS:000250074800043

The coef ficients are defined by sigma(rr) (r, 0) - Sigma(infinity)(n=0) k(n) (2r)(n-1/2) + T-n (2r)(n), which gives the radial stress at a distance, r, in front of the crack tip. In this asymptotic series the stress intensity factor, k(0), is the first coefficient, and the T-stress, To, is the second coefficient. For the example of an edge crack in a half space, converged values of the first 12 mode I coefficients (k(n) and T-n, n = 0,..., 5) have been determined, and for an edge crack in a finite width strip, the first six coefficients are presented. Coefficients for an internal crack in a half space are also presented. Results for an edge crack in a finite width strip are used to quantify the size of the k-dominant zone, the kT-dominant zone and the zones associated with three and four terms, taking into account the entire region around the crack tip.

Riverine water chemistry was characterized using grab samples collected annually under spring season baseflow conditions. During the 4-year time period associated with this study, climatic variations included two severe drought spring seasons (2001 and 2002), one above-normal precipitation spring season (2003), and one below-normal precipitation spring season (2004). The influence of drought and human activities on the baseflow chemistry of the river was evaluated by comparing concentrations of dissolved anions, total metals, and other important water chemistry parameters for these different years. Concentrations of copper and zinc, common non-point source contaminants related to urban activities, were not substantially elevated in the river within the urban area under baseflow conditions when compared with headwater and tributary samples. In contrast, nitrate concentrations increased from 1.2-1.6 mg/l up to 2.6-2.9 mg/l through the urban stream reach. Concentrations of other major anions (e.g., sulfate, nitrate) also increased along the reach, suggesting that the river receives continuous inputs of these species from within the urban area. The highest concentrations of major cations and anions typically were observed immediately downstream from the two WWTP effluent discharge locations. Attenuation of nitrate downstream from the WWTPs did not always track chloride changes, suggesting that nitrate concentrations were being controlled by biochemical processes in addition to physical processes. The relative trends in decreasing nitrate concentrations with downstream distance appeared to depend on drought versus non-drought conditions, with biological processes presumably serving as a more important control during non-drought spring seasons.									9	0	0	8	0	9			0167-6369			WOS:000248624700015	17171246

J	Porter, Sanford D.; Valles, Steven M.; Davis, Timothy S.; Briano, Juan A.; Calcaterra, Luis A.; Oi, David H.; Jenkins, Austin								Host specificity of the microsporidian pathogen Vairimorpha iivvictae at five field sites with infected Solenopsis invicta fire ant colonies in northern Argentina								FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST				90	3			447	452		10.1653/0015-4040(2007)90[447:HSOTMP]2.0.CO;2			SEP 2007	2007	The microsporidian pathogen Vairimorpha invictae is being evaluated for release in the United States as a potential self-sustaining biological control agent for imported fire ants. We examined the host range of this pathogen at 5 sites in northern Argentina where Solenopsis invicta Buren fire ant colonies had high levels of infection (28-83%). At 3 sites near the city of Corrientes, we examined 509 non-Solenopsis ants from 61 collections, 12 genera, and 19 species with a polymerase chain reaction-based screening procedure. No V invictae infections were detected in any of the samples. At 2 sites near San Javier in Santa Fe Province, 350 km to the south, we screened another 438 non-Solenopsis ants from 44 baits, 4 genera, and 4 species, again with no infections. At the Corrientes sites, we also examined 235 non-ant arthropods from 10 orders, 43 families, and more than 80 species. None were infected with V invictae. The results of this study indicate that, in its native South American range, V invictae is specific to Solenopsis fire ants.									5	0	0	5	0	6			0015-4040			WOS:000249909100006		
J	Lee, Andy W. C.; Liu, Yihai								Bending creep of small samples from parallel strand lumber								FOREST PRODUCTS JOURNAL				57	9			73	78					SEP 2007	2007	Parallel strand lumber (PSL) is an engineered wood product intended for a wide variety of structural applications, such as rafters, joists, and headers. Using commercially produced southern pine PSL and yellow-poplar PSL, this study was carried out to assess the bending creep of small PSL samples under different environmental conditions and to develop models for predicting their long-term creep. The major findings are summarized as follows. At a constant temperature, creep deflections in PSL increase with the increase of relative humidity levels. PSL shows greater creep deflections when exposed to the outdoor environment than to the indoor environment. Creep deflections in PSL increase with increasing load levels. In general, southern pine PSL shows lower creep deflections than yellow-poplar PSL under the same environmental condition and load level. Edgewise direction in PSL exhibits lower creep deflections than flatwise direction, due mainly to the former having higher bending stiffness than the latter. Four-element model can closely predict the creep deflections in PSL under a constant condition.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0015-7473			WOS:000249861200011

J	Bashash, Saeid; Jalili, Nader								Robust multiple frequency trajectory tracking control of piezoelectrically driven micro/nanopositioning systems								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONTROL SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY				15	5			867	878		10.1109/TCST.2007.902949			SEP 2007	2007	A novel modeling and control methodology is proposed in this paper for real-time compensation of nonlinearities along with precision trajectory control of piezoelectric actuators in various range of frequency operation. By integrating a modified Prandtl-lshlinskii hysteresis operator with a second-order linear dynamics, a nonlinear dynamic model and an inverse feedforward controller are developed and experimentally validated for a piezoelectrically driven nanopositioning stage. This modeling and control framework, however, lacks the accuracy due to the hysteresis model limitation, parametric uncertainties, and ever present unmodeled dynamics. Utilizing the sliding mode control strategy coupled with a perturbation estimation technique, a robust controller is then proposed for trajectory tracking of the actuator displacement. The controller gains are adjusted based on an intelligent comparison of the dynamic model and the control law. Eventually, the performance of the proposed controller is verified for the nanopositioning stage which is equipped with a high resolution capacitive position sensor. Experimental results demonstrate that the controller is capable of precisely tracking triangular and multiple frequency sinusoidal trajectories, which are common practices in many scanning probe microscopy systems.									96	6	0	0	0	101			1063-6536			WOS:000249161300006

Exploiting organizational knowledge in developing IS project cost and schedule estimates: An empirical study								INFORMATION & MANAGEMENT				44	6			598	612		10.1016/j.im.2007.06.002			SEP 2007	2007	Project management is vital to the effective application of organizational resources to competing demands within and across projects. The effective application of project management, however, is predicated upon accurate estimates of the project budget and schedule. This study assesses primary and supporting activities that exploit knowledge within an organization's memory to develop project schedule durations and budgets. The study further assesses the subsequent impact of predictability on project success. Two hundred and sixteen survey responses from IT professionals with project management responsibilities were analyzed. Results found use of the primary activities of using parametric estimating techniques (use of formal models), bottom-up estimating techniques (formulating estimates at the task level), and the support activities of team reliance, realistic targets, and professional experience all impact the predictability of estimates for project cost and duration. Predictability in turn was found to directly impact project success with regards to meeting cost and duration objectives. While use of analogous estimating techniques (using similar previous projects) was not found to be useful for project managers with more experience, it was used by project managers with less experience in determining predictability.

Biomaterial strategies to reduce implant-associated infections								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL ORGANS				30	9			828	841					SEP 2007	2007	Although the prophylaxis in controlling sterility within the operating room environment has been greatly improved, implant-associated infection is still one of the most serious complications in implant surgeries due to the existence of immune depression in the peri-implant area. The antibacterial ability of materials themselves logically becomes an important factor in preventing implant-associated infections. With the understanding of the pathogenesis of implant-associated infections, many approaches have been developed through providing an anti-adhesive surface, delivering antibacterial agents to disrupt cell-cell communication and preventing bacteria aggregation or biofilm formation, or killing bacteria directly (lysing the cell membrane). In this article, we review the current strategies in improving the antibacterial ability of materials to prevent implant infection and further present promising tactics in materials design and applications.									22	2	0	11	0	24			0391-3988			WOS:000250731200012	17918129

LDI was used as hard segment and polycaprolactone (PCL) and/or PEG were used as soft segments. By changing the PCL to PEG ratio during the prepolymer synthesis, polyurethanes with different soft segmental structures, hydrophilicity, and cytophilicity were obtained after tight-initiated polymerization. The chemical structures of the synthesized polymers were characterized using differential scanning calorimetry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Physical properties such as swelling, mechanical properties, and in vitro degradation were evaluated. Materials containing a higher ratio of PEG exhibit higher water absorbance, higher degradation rate in vitro, and lower mechanical strength in the hydrated state. Mouse emobryonal carcinoma-derived clonal chondrocytes were used as a model cell type to study the cytocompatibility of the synthesized polymers. Chondrocyte attachment, proliferation rates, and morphologies varied with changes in the PCL/PEG ratio. With a higher PEG ratio, lower cell attachment and proliferation were observed. To improve the cell attachment and proliferation on high PEG content hydrogels, bioactive molecules, such as peptides and proteins, were conjugated or immobilized in the gel matrix during the light-curing process. In this study, a short peptide, Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser, was used as a model biomolecule and incorporated into the gels during the light-curing process and improved cell growth was observed. In summary, the use of PCL/PEG at different ratios, as well as the introduction of HEMA into polyurethane, allows the synthesis of a series of biocompatible elastic hydrogels with tunable physical and cytophilic properties through light-initiated polymerization. This series of materials also allows for controlling cell attachment and growth by incorporating bioactive molecules during the light-curing process.

These evaluations are performed for an approximate hazard level of 2% in 50 years by performing nonlinear time history analyses on three-dimensional analytical models. The results show significant vulnerabilities in the reinforced concrete columns, the abutments, and also in unseating of the girders. In general, the longitudinal loading of the bridges results in larger demands than the transverse loading. However, the simply supported bridge sustains bearing deformations in the transverse direction which are on the same order as their longitudinal response. These results suggest that both longitudinal and transverse loading are significant and should be considered when performing seismic hazard analyses of these bridges.									10	1	0	0	0	11			1084-0702			WOS:000248817700009

The mixed formulation allows for approximation of both displacement and pressure at each time step, without the need for post-processing. Lowest-order and next-to-lowest-order Raviart-Thomas elements are used for the spatial discretization, and centered finite differences are used to advance in time. Use of these Raviart-Thomas elements results in a diagonal mass matrix for resolution of pressure, and a mass matrix for the displacement variable that is sparse with a simple structure. Convergence results for a model problem are provided, as are numerical results for a two-dimensional problem with a point source. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Twice a day for 10 d, 12 fermenters were fed a diet that consisted of 52% forage and 48% grain mixture that contained 3% (dry matter basis) FF or OF, with or without AO. The OF contained a higher concentration of peroxides (215 vs. 3.5 mEq/kg), and a lower concentration of unsaturated fatty acids than the FF. Feeding OF reduced nitrogen digestibility, microbial nitrogen yield, and efficiency (expressed as kilograms of dry matter digested) and increased the outflow of saturated fatty acids in the effluent when compared with feeding FF. Adding AO improved total carbohydrate, neutral, and acid detergent fiber digestibilities and the amount of digested feed nitrogen converted to microbial nitrogen across the types of fats. From this study, we concluded that feeding OF reduced microbial nitrogen and increased the outflow of saturated fatty acids. Feeding AO improved fiber digestibility by rumen microorganisms, regardless of the type of fat.									17	6	0	14	0	22			0022-0302			WOS:000248737400041	17699057

Monitoring flight calls of migrating birds from an oil platform in the northern Gulf of Mexico								JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY				78	3			279	289		10.1111/j.1557-9263.2007.00115.x			SEP 2007	2007	Millions of birds migrate across the Gulf of Mexico each year. However, most studies of migration in this region involve sampling onshore locations during the day, potentially underrepresenting the diversity and abundance of migrants passing the region. We evaluated a potential solution to this problem by recording the flight calls of passing migrants from an oil platform located southeast of the Alabama coast in the Gulf of Mexico. We detected 2762 calls during 30 nights from 9 September to 2 November 1999, and were able to identify 2329 calls to species. Flight calls by nine species of birds represented 23% of all identified calls. The greatest number of calls during one night (1017 calls) and during a 1-h period (257 calls) were recorded on 10 September. The greatest number of calls was recorded 8 h after sunset, with a secondary peak 2 h after sunset. The peak prior to sunrise may indicate the formation of flocks at dawn, and the peak after sunset may have been caused by the first wave of migrants reaching the platform. However, call counts varied extensively, with 98% of all calls recorded during 13 nights and 40% on a single night, possibly resulting from hourly and nightly differences in bird numbers aloft, atmospheric conditions, and artificial lighting conditions. Although recording on oil platforms can be difficult because of mechanical, wind, and wave noise, our results suggest great potential for describing the species composition of passing vocal migrants and the temporal patterns of flight-calling behavior if quiet recording locations can be found. Moreover, flight call monitoring could be a critically important tool for bird conservation in this region, given recent proposals to develop wind power and the potential bird mortality associated with such developments.									22	0	0	23	1	25			0273-8570	1557-9263		WOS:000249179900006

Nanotube-containing carbon fibers were produced from these mixtures and their mechanical and electrical properties were investigated. Mesophase pitch containing up to 0.3 wt% multi-wall carbon nanotubes could be melt spun at a temperature of 305 degrees C. The rheological data indicated that the viscosity of mesophase pitch containing 0.1 wt% multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) was not significantly different from that of the as-received mesophase pitch.. Microstructural examination revealed that the carbon fibers produced from the as-received mesophase pitch had radial cross-sectional textures. By contrast, the carbon fibers produced from mesophase pitch containing similar to 0.3 wt% MWNT had random cross-sectional textures. Although the addition of MWNTs changed to fiber texture from radial to random, neither the tensile strength or the modulus of the fibers changed significantly. However, the electrical resistivities of the carbon fibers containing MWNTs were approximately 25 % lower than those formed from the as-received mesophase.									10	0	0	0	0	10			1226-086X			WOS:000249796000013

Modeling relative importance of design criteria with a modified Pareto preference								JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN				129	9			907	914		10.1115/1.2747634			SEP 2007	2007	Engineering design problems are studied within a multicriteria optimization and decision-making framework. A methodology is developed that modifies the traditional Pareto preference to model designer's preferences reflected in the relative importance Of criteria. The intent is to reduce the number of candidate designs to facilitate the selection of a preferred design. The versatility of this preference model allows it to be incorporated into the problem solution process either a priori, a posteriori, or iteratively, each offering different advantages. In the a priori approach, all Pareto efficient designs that do not satisfy the designer's preferences are never computed. In the a posteriori approach, a set of Pareto efficient designs is computed and then easily reduced based on the designer's preferences. Finally, the iterative approach offers the ability to adjust the designer's preferences by exploring their impact on the reduction of the Pareto efficient design set. The methodology is based on the concepts of convex cones and allowable tradeoff values between criteria. The theoretical foundation of the preference model is presented in the context of engineering design and the methodology is illustrated using a bi-criteria structural design problem and a tri-criteria vehicle dynamics design problem.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1050-0472			WOS:000249451800003

The mu SGI uses a phase sensitive deformable diffraction grating to achieve interferometric axial resolution and a microfabricated lens to improve lateral resolution of the measurement. The grating is intended to be actuated to control diffraction patterns while measuring the MEMS vibration to increase measurement sensitivity. The deformable grating and the microlens are fabricated by surface micromachining techniques on separate wafers which are then precisely aligned and assembled. The fabricated deformable grating shows an actuation range of 0.54 mu m and an operating voltage of under 31 V. An assembled grating and lens chip are successfully integrated with a silicon photodiode in less than 2 cm(3). The integrated mu SGI has been demonstrated by measuring 4.4 nm, 900 kHz vibration of a MEMS device while actuating the deformable grating in the measurement.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0960-1317			WOS:000249222400029

A two-step living anionic polymerization method was used. Firstly, oligo(styryl)lithium grafted poly(divinylbenzene) cores were used as multifunctional initiators to initiate living anionic polymerization of styrene in benzene at room temperature. Secondly, vinylpyridine was polymerized at the periphery of these living (polystyrene), stars in tetrahydrofuran at -78 degrees C. The resulting copolymers were characterized using size exclusion chromatography, multiangle laser light scattering, H-1 NMR, elemental analysis, and intrinsic viscosity measurements.

However, systematic and random assay errors from multiple sources must be considered to confidently infer authentic protein-protein interactions. To address this issue, we developed a general, robust statistical method for inferring authentic interactions from protein prey-by-bait frequency tables using a binomial-based likelihood ratio test (LRT) coupled with Bayes' Odds estimation. We then applied our LRT-Bayes' algorithm experimentally using data from protein complexes isolated from Rhodopseudomonas palustris. Our algorithm, in conjunction with the experimental protocol, inferred with high confidence authentic interacting proteins from abundant, stable complexes, but few or no authentic interactions for lower-abundance complexes. The algorithm can discriminate against a background of prey proteins that are detected in association with a large number of baits as an artifact of the measurement. We conclude that the experimental protocol including the LRT-Bayes' algorithm produces results with high confidence but moderate sensitivity. We also found that Monte Carlo simulation is a feasible tool for checking modeling assumptions, estimating parameters, and evaluating the significance of results in protein association studies.									8	0	0	8	0	9			1535-3893			WOS:000249371000043	17691832

Reports of envenomation by brown recluse spiders exceed verified specimens of Loxosceles spiders in South Carolina								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN BOARD OF FAMILY MEDICINE				20	5			483	488		10.3122/jabfm.2007.05.060221			SEP-OCT 2007	2007	Purpose: To determine whether the number of brown recluse spider bites diagnosed by South Carolina physicians coincides with evidence of brown recluse spiders found in the state. Methods: Brown recluse spider bite diagnosis data were extracted from 1990 and 2004 surveys of South Carolina physicians. This was compared with the known historical evidence of brown recluse spiders collected in South Carolina and derived from various sources, including state agencies, arachnologists, and museum specimens. Results: South Carolina physicians diagnosed 478 brown recluse spider bites in 1990 and 738 in 2004. Dating to 1953, 44 brown recluse spider specimens have been verified from 6 locations in South Carolina. Discussion: The number of brown recluse bites reportedly diagnosed in South Carolina greatly outnumbers the verified brown recluse specimens that have been collected in the state. The pattern of bite diagnoses outnumbering verified brown recluse specimens has been reported in other areas outside of this spider's known endemic range.									9	0	0	4	0	9			1557-2625			WOS:000249286000008	17823466

Centrin1 is required for organelle segregation and cytokinesis in Trypanosoma brucei								MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF THE CELL				18	9			3290	3301		10.1091/mbc.E07-01-0022			SEP 2007	2007	Centrin is a calcium-binding centrosome/basal body-associated protein involved in duplication and segregation of these organelles in eukaryotes. We had shown that disruption of one of the centrin genes (centrin1) in Leishmania amastigotes resulted in failure of both basal body duplication and cytokinesis. Here, we undertook to define the role of centrin1 (TbCen1) in the duplication and segregation of basal body and its associated organelles kinetoplast and Golgi, as well as its role in cytokinesis of the procyclic form of Trypanosoma brucei by depleting its protein using RNA inhibition methodology. TbCen1-depleted cells showed significant reduction in growth compared with control cells. Morphological analysis of these cells showed they were large and pleomorphic with multiple detached flagella. Both immunofluorescence assays using organelle-specific antibodies and electron microscopic analysis showed that TbCen1-deficient cells contained multiple basal bodies, kinetoplasts, Golgi, and nuclei. These multiple organelles were, however, closely clustered together, indicating duplication without segregation in the absence of centrin. This failure in organelle segregation may be the likely cause of inhibition of cytokinesis, suggesting for the first time a new and unique role for centrin in the segregation of organelles without affecting their multiplication in the procyclic form of T. brucei.									47	0	1	45	0	48			1059-1524			WOS:000249162200006	17567955

Combined treatment of dendritoma vaccine and low-dose interleukin-2 in stage IV renal cell carcinoma patients induced clinical response: A pilot study								ONCOLOGY REPORTS				18	3			665	671					SEP 2007	2007	Vaccination using dendritic/tumor cell hybrids represents a novel and promising cancer immunotherapy. We have developed a technology that can instantly purify the hybrids (dendritomas) from the fusion mixture of dendritic cells (DCs) and tumor cells. Our animal studies and a phase I study of stage IV melanoma patients demonstrated that dendritoma vaccination could be conducted without major toxicity and induced tumor cell-specific immunological and clinical responses. In this pilot study, ten stage IV renal cell carcinoma patients were studied. Dendritomas were made from autologous DCs and tumor cells and administered by subcutaneous injection. After initial vaccination, three escalating doses of IL-2 (3, 6, and 9 million units each) were followed within five days. This treatment regimen was tolerated well without severe adverse events directly related to the dendritoma vaccine. Most adverse events were related to IL-2 administration or pre-existing disease. Patient-specific immune responses were evaluated by flow cytometric measurement of interferon-gamma-producing T-cells before and after vaccination in response to stimulation with tumor antigens. Nine out of nine patients eligible for the analysis showed an increase of IFN-gamma-expressing CD4(+) T cells after vaccination(s); while five out of eight patients eligible for the analysis showed an increase of IFN-gamma-expressing CD8(+) T cells. Clinical responses were documented in 40% of the patients, three with stabilization of disease and one with a partial response documented by a reduction in tumor size. This pilot study demonstrated that dendritoma vaccines could be administered safely to patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, while producing both clinical and immunologic evidence of response.									25	3	0	17	0	28			1021-335X	1791-2431		WOS:000248669400021	17671717

The SWNT network shows Coulomb gap variable-range hopping conduction at low temperatures. The magnetoresistance (MR) involves the interplay of two phenomena: a forward interference process leading to negative MR together with shrinkage of electronic wave function contributing to the positive MR. These two mechanisms fit the low-field data. The analysis of magnetotransport data gives an estimate for intrinsic parameters including localization length and Coulomb gap. The temperature dependence of the forward interference mechanism is shown to follow an inverse power-law dependence with an exponent close to 1, indicating the weak scattering process involved in the transport.									20	0	0	0	0	20			1098-0121			WOS:000249786400009

The main production reaction, Ca-40(alpha,gamma)Ti-44, has been studied in inverse kinematics with the recoil mass spectrometer DRAGON located at the TRIUMF-ISAC facility in Vancouver, Canada. The temperature range relevant for alpha-rich freeze-out during a core-collapse supernova has been covered entirely with a Ca-40 beam of 0.60 to 1.15 MeV/nucleon. All relevant quantities for the calculation of the astrophysical reaction rate have been measured directly. Because of many previously undiscovered resonances, the reaction rate derived from the energy dependent Ti-44 yield is higher than the one based on previous prompt gamma-ray studies commonly used in supernova models. The presented new rate results in an increased Ti-44 production in supernovae.									26	0	0	0	0	26			2469-9985	2469-9993		WOS:000249786600060

Then, utilizing expressions for the robot forward kinematics as well as the decomposition of a homography relating a reference image of the robot to the actual robot image, we obtain the three-dimensional shape information continuously. We then use this information to demonstrate the development of a kinematic controller to regulate the manipulator end-effector to a constant desired position and orientation.									19	0	0	0	0	19			0263-5747	1469-8668		WOS:000250929000008

De Quincey does not merely celebrate literature for the heightened emotional state that it supplies but also offers literature in response to the sheer number of books that wait to be read, which causes a form of madness. Literature's function in "Letters" is to counter the madness for more knowledge that reading always possibly inspires.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0039-3657			WOS:000255009200004

Tillage and soybean canopy effects on common cocklebur (Xanthium strumarium) emergence								WEED SCIENCE				55	5			474	480		10.1614/WS-07-003.1			SEP-OCT 2007	2007	Field experiments were conducted in Pendleton, SC, in 2004 and 2005, to determine the influence of tillage with or without soybean on common cocklebur emergence. Treatments included no-till/no soybean (NTNS), no-till plus soybean (NTS), tillage/no soybean (TNS), and tillage plus soybean (TS). Emergence was monitored from an artificial seed bank in 2004 and a natural seed bank in 2005. Overall, common cocklebur emerged from early May through late October and presented multiple emergence. In no-till plots with or without soybean, initial emergence was delayed 7 d in both years. In TNS plots, major emergence (daily emergence > mean emergence plus standard deviation) of common cocklebur occurred from early May to late July. In NTNS plots, major emergence occurred from late May through late August. No-till reduced total common cocklebur emergence by 59 to 69% compared with tillage. At the V5 to V6 soybean growth stage, the daily soil thermal fluctuation at 2.5 cm soil depth diminished from approximately 15 to 5 C and reduced common cocklebur emergence by 84 to 91% for the rest of the growing season. Common cocklebur emergence was higher when the mean soil temperature was > 15 C, and the daily thermal fluctuation was > 7.5 C. This study suggests that strategies that promote early crop canopy development and minimum tillage should reduce common cocklebur emergence.									4	0	0	6	1	6			0043-1745			WOS:000249169700011

The density profiles, brush interpenetration, chain inclination, normal forces, and shear forces for two flat substrates modified by doubly bound bead-necklace polymers and equivalent singly bound polymers (twice as many polymer chains of 1/2 the molecular weight of the loop chains) were determined and compared as a function of surface separation, grafting density, and shear velocity. The doubly bound polymer layers showed less interpenetration with decreasing separation than the equivalent singly bound layers. Surprisingly, this difference in interpenetration between doubly bound polymer and singly bound polymer did not result in decreased friction at high shear velocity possibly due to the decreased ability of the doubly bound chains to deform in response to the applied shear. However, at lower shear velocity, where deformation of the chains in the flow direction is less pronounced and the difference in interpenetration is greater between the doubly bound and singly bound chains, some reduction in friction was observed.									10	0	0	1	0	10			0021-9606			WOS:000249156300077	17764297

Their Z-scan measurements reveal that optical limiting under 532 nm excitation stems from a strong nonlinear scattering (NLS) subsequent to nonlinear absorption (NLA) by suspension. On the other hand, the optical limiting is entirely due to NLA when excited with 1064 nm excitation in the nanosecond regime. The occurrence of NLS at one wavelength and absence at another is unusual, especially when compared to the behavior of carbon nanotubes under similar conditions, in which NLS is dominant at both wavelengths.									35	1	0	1	0	35			0003-6951			WOS:000249156100096

After the deposition, the particles were stripped into solution and characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy as well as transmission and scanning electron microscopy. The presence of the caps shifted the plasmon resonance into the red spectral region according to the refractive index of the cap material. In the case of metals, specifically Fe, the cap damped the plasmon resonance, and to minimize this effect, a thin layer of SiO was deposited between the Ag core and Fe cap. A thin layer of SiO also was deposited on top of the Fe cap to protect the latter from oxidation in the aqueous environment. The Fe cap rendered magnetic properties to plasmonic AHNs.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0897-4756			WOS:000248692500019

The comparison of the absolute total detection efficiencies for a point, line and spherical source geometry of Co-60 and Cs-137 at different source-to-detector distance showed that the absolute detection efficiency for PVT is higher relative to the other detectors of typical dimensions for that material. However, the absolute peak detection efficiency of some of these detectors are higher relative to PVT, for example the absolute peak detection efficiency of NaI:Tl (7.62 cm diameter x 7.62 cm long), HPGe (7.62 cm diameter x 7.62 cm long), HPXe (11.43cm diameter x 60.96cm long), and LaCl3:Ce (5.08cm diameter x 5.08 cm long) are all greater than that of a 188.82 cm x 60.96 cm x 5.08 cm PVT detector for Co-60 and (CS)-C-137 for all geometries studied. The absolute total and absolute peak detection efficiencies of a right circular cylinder of NaI:Tl with various diameters and thicknesses were determined for a point source. The effect of changing the solid angle on the NaI:Tl detectors showed that with increasing solid angle and detector thickness, the absolute efficiency increases. This work establishes a common basis for differentiating detector materials for passive portal monitoring of gamma ray radiation. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This may be due to the invisibility of these cells in aqueous solution, and because sugars and salts added to the cell culture for manipulation of the osmotic conditions inhibit transformation of normal cells into tubular shaped structures.Results: We report the transformation of normal spherical mammalian cells into tubular shaped structures in response to stress. We have termed these transformed structures 'straw cells' which we have associated with a variety of human tissue types, including fresh, post mortem and frozen lung, liver, skin, and heart. We have also documented the presence of straw cells in bovine brain and prostate tissues of mice. The number of straw cells in heart, lung tissues, and collapsed straw cells in urine increases with the age of the mammal. Straw cells were also reproduced in vitro from human cancer cells ( THP1, CACO2, and MCF7) and mouse stem cells ( D1 and adipose D1) by dehydrating cultured cells. The tubular center of the straw cells is much smaller than the original cell; houses condensed organelles and have filamentous extensions that are covered with microscopic hair- like structures and circular openings. When rehydrated, the filaments uptake water rapidly. The straw cell walls, have a range of 120 nm to 200 nm and are composed of sulfated- glucose polymers and glycosylated acidic proteins. The transformation from normal cell to straw cells takes 5 to 8 hr in open- air. This process is characterized by an increase in metabolic activity. When rehydrated, the straw cells regain their normal spherical shape and begin to divide in 10 to 15 days. Like various types of microbial spores, straw cells are resistant to harsh environmental conditions such as UV- C radiation.Conclusion: Straw cells are specialized cellular structures and not artifacts from spontaneous polymerization, which are generated in response to stress conditions, like dehydration. The disintegrative, mobile, disruptive and ubiquitous nature of straw cells makes this a possible physiological process that may be involved in human health, longevity, and various types of diseases such as cancer.									3	0	0	1	0	3			1471-2121			WOS:000250057000001	17705822

UV-vis spectroscopic monitoring of the reaction as well as the kinetics lead to the conclusion that the crucial step of the process is the monomolecular decomposition of a diperoxovanadium(V) complex containing the pca ligand to afford the peroxyl radical, HOO center dot and a V(IV) derivative. The rate-limiting step in the overall process may not be this (rapid) decomposition itself but (prior to this step) the slow hydrogen transfer from a coordinated H2O2 molecule to the oxygen atom of a pca ligand at the vanadium center: "(pca)(O)V center dot center dot center dot O2H2" -> "(pca)(HO-)V-OOH". The V(IV) derivative reacts with a new hydrogen peroxide molecule to generate the hydroxyl radical ("V-IV" + H2O2 -> "V-V" + HO- + HO center dot), active in the activation of isopropanol: HO center dot + Me2CH(OH) -> H2O + Me2C center dot(OH). The reaction with an alkane, RH, in acetonitrile proceeds analogously, and in this case the hydroxyl radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from the alkane: HO center dot + RH -> H2O + R-center dot. These conclusions are in a good agreement with the results obtained by Bell and co-workers (Khaliullin, R. Z.; Bell, A. T.; Head-Gordon, M. J. Phys. Chem. B 2005, 109, 17984-17992) who recently carried out a density functional theory study of the mechanism of radical generation in the reagent under discussion in acetonitrile.									77	0	0	3	0	77			1089-5639			WOS:000248658000009	17655204

A set S subset of V is a defensive alliance if vertical bar N[x] boolean AND S vertical bar >= vertical bar N[x] - S vertical bar for every x epsilon S. Thus, each vertex of a defensive alliance can, with the aid of its neighbors in S, be defended from attack by its neighbors outside of S. An entire set S is secure if any subset X subset of S can be defended from an attack from outside of S, under an appropriate definition of what such a defense implies. Necessary and sufficient conditions for a set to be secure are determined. Published by Elsevier B.V.									17	0	0	0	0	17			0166-218X			WOS:000249236300006

Using spectral reflectance to document water stress in bermudagrass grown on water repellent sandy soils								HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES				21	17			2385	2389		10.1002/hyp.6752			AUG 15 2007	2007	To conserve natural water resources, athletic fields may be mandated to follow phase water restrictions. In order to optimize irrigation reduction, early plant responses to water stress need to be identified to avoid loss in turfgrass performance and the requirement of additional irrigation to overcome water stress. Current irrigation scheduling based on using potential evapotranspiration (ET) and water stress indices are not suitable for all growing conditions, especially in the water repellent sand soils of South Florida. This experiment was conducted to use spectral reflectance as a means to document normal and progressive water stress in 'Tifgreen' bermudagrass (Cynodon dactvIon (L.) Pers. X Cynodon transvattlensis Burn Davy) grown on a native water repellent sand soil. Three consecutive trials were conducted, in which bermuclagrass was subjected to either no irrigation until severe visual wilt (non-irrigated) or irrigated daily (irrigated) over a dry down period. Visual assessment of turf quality and localized dry spot occurrence verified that bermudagrass receiving daily irrigation was not water-limited and bermudarass receivin-no irrigation was experiencing sensor was used to monitor changes in plant architecture as a means to determine early water stress. Monitoring near-IR/red ratios determined mid-day depression when water demand is at the highest as well as overnight rehydration in both bermudagrasses. At the end of the dry down period, pooled trial morning near-IR/red ratios-afternoon near-IR/red ratios from non-irrigated bermudagrass was significantly greater than irrigated bermudagrass (P = 0.0035), documenting severe water Stress from the non-irrigated bermudagrass. Spectral reflectance allows real-time, site-specific bermudagrass water stress evaluation before it is visually identifiable. Using spectral reflectance as an early warning detection tool can be used for better irriuation decisions including pre-emptive irriuation to avoid water stress, compared to models based on predetermined ET and water stress indices.

We recently conducted a literature survey on the effective matrix diffusion coefficient, De,, a key parameter for describing matrix diffusion processes at the field scale. Forty field tracer tests at 15 fractured geologic sites were surveyed and selected for the study, based on data availability and quality. Field-scale D-m(e) values were calculated, either directly using data reported in the literature, or by reanalyzing the corresponding field tracer tests. The reanalysis was conducted for the selected tracer tests using analytic or semi-analytic solutions for tracer transport in linear, radial, or interwell flow fields. Surveyed data show that the scale factor of the effective matrix diffusion coefficient (defined as the ratio of D-m(e) to the lab-scale matrix diffusion coefficient, D-m, of the same tracer) is generally larger than one, indicating that the effective matrix diffusion coefficient in the field is comparatively larger than the matrix diffusion coefficient at the rock-core scale. This larger value can be attributed to the many mass-transfer processes at different scales in naturally heterogeneous, fractured rock systems.Furthermore, we observed a moderate, on average trend toward systematic increase in the scale factor with observation scale. This trend suggests that the effective matrix diffusion coefficient is likely to be statistically scale-dependent. The scale-factor value ranges from 0.5 to 884 for observation scales from 5 to 2000 in. At a given scale, the scale factor varies by two orders of magnitude, reflecting the influence of differing degrees of fractured rock heterogeneity at different geologic sites. In addition, the surveyed data indicate that field-scale longitudinal dispersivity generally increases with observation scale, which is consistent with previous studies. The scale-dependent field-scale matrix diffusion coefficient (and dispersivity) may have significant implications for assessing long-term, large-scale radionuclide and contaminant transport events in fractured rock, both for nuclear waste disposal and contaminant remediation.

One of the next grand challenges is to dissect the cellular networks consisting of many individual functional modules. Defining co-expression networks without ambiguity based on genome-wide microarray data is difficult and current methods are not robust and consistent with different data sets. This is particularly problematic for little understood organisms since not much existing biological knowledge can be exploited for determining the threshold to differentiate true correlation from random noise. Random matrix theory (RMT), which has been widely and successfully used in physics, is a powerful approach to distinguish system-specific, non-random properties embedded in complex systems from random noise. Here, we have hypothesized that the universal predictions of RMT are also applicable to biological systems and the correlation threshold can be determined by characterizing the correlation matrix of microarray profiles using random matrix theory.Results: Application of random matrix theory to microarray data of S. oneidensis, E. coli, yeast, A. thaliana, Drosophila, mouse and human indicates that there is a of nearest neighbour spacing distribution (NNSD) of correlation matrix after gradually removing certain elements insider the matrix. Testing on an in silico modular model has demonstrated that this transition can be used to determine the correlation threshold for revealing modular co-expression networks. The co-expression network derived from yeast cell cycling microarray data is supported by gene annotation. The topological properties of the resulting co-expression network agree well with the general properties of biological networks. Computational evaluations have showed that RMT approach is sensitive and robust. Furthermore, evaluation on sampled expression data of an in silico modular gene system has showed that under-sampled expressions do not affect the recovery of gene co-expression network. Moreover, the cellular roles of 215 functionally unknown genes from yeast, E. coli and S. oneidensis are predicted by the gene co-expression networks using guilt-by-association principle, many of which are supported by existing information or our experimental verification, further demonstrating the reliability of this approach for gene function prediction.Conclusion: Our rigorous analysis of gene expression microarray profiles using RMT has showed that the transition of NNSD of correlation matrix of microarray profile provides a profound theoretical criterion to determine the correlation threshold for identifying gene co-expression networks.									69	3	0	54	0	73			1471-2105			WOS:000252547800001	17697349

Rapid sampling of reactive Langevin trajectories via noise-space Monte Carlo								JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS				127	6					064106	10.1063/1.2756834			AUG 14 2007	2007	A noise-space Monte Carlo approach to sampling reactive Langevin trajectories is introduced and compared to a configuration based approach. The noise sampling is shown to overcome the slow relaxation of the configuration based method. Furthermore, the noise sampling is shown to sample multiple pathways with the correct probabilities without any additional work being required formally or algorithmically. The path sampling proceeds without any introduction of fictitious interactions and includes only the parameters appearing in Langevin's equation.

The arsenides Re-3(Ge,As)(7) are new examples with promising thermoelectric properties, comparable with the isostructural Mo3Sb5.4Te1.6, a competitive high-temperature material. Various doping levels may be achieved by using different Ge/As ratios. Re-3(Ge,As)(7) was prepared by heating the elements in the desired ratios in evacuated silica tubes between 600 and 800 degrees C. Re3GeAs6 crystallizes in the cubic Ir3Ge7 type, space group Im $$($) over barm, with a = 8.73202(8) A. It exhibits high Seebeck coefficient, high electrical conductivity, and reasonably low thermal conductivity. Moreover, the thermoelectric figure-of-merit ZT = TS2 sigma/kappa increases rapidly with increasing temperature, as desired for high-temperature thermoelectrics.									20	0	0	0	0	20			0897-4756			WOS:000248439400030		
J	Liu, Jun; Spraul, Bryan K.; Topping, Chris; Smith, Dennis W., Jr.; McHugh, Mark A.								Effect of hexafluoroisopropylidene on perfluorocyclobutyl aryl ether copolymer solution behavior in supercritical CO2 and propane								MACROMOLECULES				40	16			5973	5977		10.1021/ma070515b			AUG 7 2007	2007	High-pressure phase behavior data reported here demonstrate the nuanced impact fluorine exerts on polymer solubility in supercritical fluid solvents. Copolymers are used that contain a perfluorocyclobutyl ether group with varying amounts of bis-aryl isopropylidene (6H) or bis-aryl hexafluoroisopropylidene (6F). Surprisingly, it takes at least 2000 bar and 190 degrees C to dissolve the 6H homopolymer in CO2 even though every repeat group has similar to 15 mol % fluorine and two ether oxygens, both of which enhance polymer solubility in CO2. The copolymer cloud-point curves in CO2 monotonically shift significantly to lower temperatures and pressures as the 6F content is increased from 0 to 100%. This shift is ascribed to the decrease in long-range, chain-chain interactions due to poor packing of the 6F-rich chains, to the increase in solvent accessible surface area of fluorinated groups, and to the increase in the fractional free volume (FFV) of 6F-rich chains. The cloud-point curves in propane also initially shift to lower temperatures and pressures with increasing 6F content, but the 6F homopolymer and 6H homopolymer curves cross one another so that the 6H homopolymers are more soluble at low temperatures while 6F homopolymers are more soluble at high temperatures. The reversal in propane solubility behavior with increasing 6F content and temperature results from a delicate balance between repulsive fluorine-hydrocarbon interactions that do not favor copolymer solubility and reduced long-range, chain-chain interactions and increased copolymer FFV that both favor copolymer solubility. The cloud-point data also show that for both CO2 and propane the impact of 6F content is greater than the impact of weight-average molecular weight in the range 15-93 kg/mol, where molecular weight is expected to have a large impact.									7	4	0	0	0	11			0024-9297			WOS:000248439700044

These films exhibit a self-selecting or "equilibrium" thickness; once a thermodynamic equilibrium is reached, the film thickness, which corresponds to the Gibbsian surface excess of vanadia adsorbates, is independent of synthesis methods, the fraction of secondary vanadia phase, and the heat treatment history. These (multilayer) adsorbate films are largely amorphous (quasiliquid) at subeutectic temperatures, where analogies to premelting and prewetting phenomena are made. Reversible film thickness versus temperature (with a hysteresis loop) is observed and explained from a force-balance model.									24	0	0	0	0	24			0003-6951	1077-3118		WOS:000248661400036

For example, testing primitivity of an element in a finite field is a special case of this problem but notoriously hard. In this paper, it is shown that if a Cayley graph Cay(G; S) is known to be connected then its fault tolerance can be determined in polynomial time in |S|log(|G|). This is accomplished by establishing a new structural result for Cayley graphs. This result also yields a simple proof of optimal fault tolerance for an infinite class of Cayley graphs, namely exchange graphs. We also use the proof technique for our structural result to give a new proof of a known result on quasiminimal graphs.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0218-0006			WOS:000248910400004

Edge detection methods applied to the analysis of spherical raindrop images								APPLIED OPTICS				46	22			5352	5367		10.1364/AO.46.005352			AUG 1 2007	2007	Optical imaging of raindrops provides important information on the statistical distribution of raindrop size and raindrop shape. These distributions are critical for extracting rainfall rates from both dual- and single-polarization radar signals. A large number of raindrop images are required to obtain these statistics, necessitating automatic processing of the imagery. The accuracy of the measured drop size depends critically on the characteristics of the digital image processing algorithm used to identify and size the drop. Additionally, the algorithm partially determines the effective depth of field of the camera/image processing system. Because a large number of drop images are required to obtain accurate statistics, a large depth of field is needed, which tends to increase errors in drop size measurement. This trade-off between accuracy and depth of field (dof) is also affected by the algorithm used to identify the drop outline. In this paper, eight edge detection algorithms are investigated and compared to determine which is best suited for accurately extracting the drop outline and measuring the diameter of an imaged raindrop while maintaining a relatively large depth of field. The algorithm which overall gave the largest dof along with the most accurate estimate of the size of the drop was the Hueekel algorithm.									3	1	0	0	0	4			1559-128X	2155-3165		WOS:000249167100065	17676151

Nucleosynthesis in neutron-rich ejecta from quark-novae								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				471	1			227	236		10.1051/0004-6361:20066593			AUG 2007	2007	We explore heavy-element nucleosynthesis by rapid neutron capture (r-process) in the decompressing ejecta from the surface of a neutron star. The decompression is triggered by a violent phase transition to strange quark matter (quark-nova scenario). The presence of neutron-rich large Z nuclei (40, 95) < ( Z, A) < (70, 177), the large neutron-to-seed ratio, and the low electron fraction Y-e similar to 0.03 in the decompressing ejecta present favorable conditions for the r-process. We perform network calculations that are adapted to the quark-nova conditions, and which mimic usual (n - gamma) equilibrium r-process calculations during the initially cold decompression phase. They match to dynamical r-process calculations at densities below neutron drip (4 x 10(11) g cm(-3)). We present results for the final element abundance distribution with and without heating from nuclear reactions, and compare to the solar abundance pattern of r-process elements. We highlight the distinguishing features of quark-novae by contrasting it with conventional nucleosynthetic sites such as type II supernovae and neutron star mergers, especially in the context of heavy-element compositions of extremely metal-deficient stars.									35	7	0	0	1	37			0004-6361			WOS:000248394400029		
J	Hopkins, William D.; Cantalupo, Claudio; Taglialatela, Jared								Handedness is associated with asymmetries in gyrification of the cerebral cortex of chimpanzees								CEREBRAL CORTEX				17	8			1750	1756		10.1093/cercor/bhl085			AUG 2007	2007	Gyrification of the cerebral cortex reflects complexity in cortical folding during development of the brain. In this paper, we evaluated whether chimpanzees show asymmetries in gyrification and if variation in gyrification asymmetries were associated with handedness. Magnetic resonance images were obtained in a sample of 76 chimpanzees, and gyrification measures were obtained from 10 equally spaced slices of the cortex. Asymmetry quotients (AQs) in gyrification were compared for 4 measures of handedness including reaching, coordinated bimanual actions, manual gestures, and throwing. Overall, the chimpanzees showed significant differences between the right and left hemispheres that were region specific. Significant differences in AQ's were found in right- and nonright-handed chimpanzees for throwing and, to a lesser degree, for manual gestures. Increasing age was associated with increasing gyrification in the prefrontal regions, particularly in female chimpanzees. The results indicate that variation in gyrification between hemispheres is associated with functional measures of laterality in chimpanzees.									15	1	0	11	0	16			1047-3211			WOS:000248374900002	17012377

Here we report that handedness is associated with variation in the size of the CC in chimpanzees. We further report that variation in brain asymmetries in a cortical region homologous to Broca's area is associated with the size of the CC but differs for right- and left-handed individuals. Collectively, the results suggest that individual differences in functional and neuroanatomical asymmetries are associated with CC variation not just in humans but also in chimpanzees and therefore may reflect a common neural basis for laterality in these 2 species.									20	1	0	15	0	21			1047-3211			WOS:000248374900003	17012376

Tolerance of direct-seeded leafy greens to herbicides applied before or after crop emergence								CROP PROTECTION				26	8			1158	1165		10.1016/j.cropro.2006.10.010			AUG 2007	2007	Field experiments were conducted in 2005 and 2006 to determine the tolerance of direct-seeded Brassica rapa L. 'Alamo', Brassica juncea (L.) Czernj. & J. M. Coulter var. crispifolia L. H. Bailey 'Southern Curled Giant', Brassica oleracea var. acephala 'Blue Knight', and Brassica oleracea L. var. acephala DC 'Top Bunch' to selected residual herbicides applied before or after crop emergence. Ten herbicides were applied at a single dose prior to crop emergence, and eight of the same herbicides were applied post-emergence relative to the crops. To allow assessment of tolerance and prevent yield loss from weed interference, the test area was kept free of weeds by cultivation and hand-weeding. Of the herbicides applied prior to crop emergence, pendimethalin at 560 ga.i./ha, thiobencarb at 1120 ga.i./ha, quinclorac at 140 ga.i./ha, and prodiamine at 515 ga.i./ha caused less than 10% injury to all crops and did not reduce density, height, or fresh weight of any of the four crops. The crops were generally more tolerant to the herbicides when applied after crop emergence than before emergence. None of the crops were injured more than 10% by S-metolachlor at 500 ga.i./ha, pendimethalin at 560 g/ha, thiobencarb at 1120 g/ha, dimethenamid at 448 g a.i./ha, and prodiamine at 515 g/ha when applied after crop emergence.

J	Keinath, A. P.; Everts, K. L.; Langston, D. B., Jr.; Egel, D. S.; Holmes, G. J.								Multi-state evaluation of reduced-risk fungicides and Melcast against Alternaria leaf blight and gummy stem blight on muskmelon								CROP PROTECTION				26	8			1251	1258		10.1016/j.cropro.2006.10.024			AUG 2007	2007	Alternaria leaf blight and gummy stem blight are important diseases of muskmelon in the eastern United States. These diseases often are managed by weekly applications of fungicides. However, many of the fungicides currently used are limited by regulatory restrictions, such as field re-entry intervals or pre-harvest intervals. Biofungicides, reduced-risk synthetic fungicides, and a weather-based fungicide application program (Melcast) were evaluated in 12 field trials for effective management of these two diseases in Maryland, Indiana, Georgia, and North Carolina from 2002 to 2004. In the first experiment, six reduced-risk fungicide programs that incorporated reduced-risk fungicides or biofurgicides to reduce mancozeb and chlorothalonil applications were compared with schedules that used only mancozeb and chlorothalonil. Areas under the disease progress curves in the reduced-risk fungicide programs did not differ significantly from those in the standard fungicide program of mancozeb followed by chlorothalonil. In two trials in 2002, acibenzolar-S-methyl reduced fruit weights. A second experiment evaluated weekly or Melcast-scheduled applications of chlorothalonil alone or in combination with harpin, azoxystrobin, or harpin and azoxystrobin. The addition of harpin did not affect disease severities in any trial. The addition of azoxystrobin reduced control of gummy stem blight in some trials but improved control of Alternaria leaf blight compared with chlorothalonil alone. Overall, reduced risk fungicides alternated with chlorothalonil performed similarly to chlorothalonil applied alone, indicating that use of these products could reduce use of chlorothalonil. However, they rarely performed better than chlorothalonil applied alone on a biweekly schedule, indicating that most or all of the disease control resulted from the chlorothalonil component of the program. In seven of eight evaluations, scheduling fungicides with Melcast reduced the number of applications compared with a weekly schedule. In four of the eight evaluations, disease level was higher with Melcast schedules than weekly sprays, and in the other four trials disease levels did not differ. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Nielson, Bryant G.; DesRoches, Reginald				DesRoches, Reginald /F-5875-2011				Analytical seismic fragility curves for typical bridges in the central and southeastern United States								EARTHQUAKE SPECTRA				23	3			615	633		10.1193/1.2756815			AUG 2007	2007	Seismic fragility curves for classes of highway bridges are essential for risk assessment of highway transportation networks exposed to seismic hazards. This study develops seismic fragility curves for nine classes of bridges (common three-span, zero-skew bridges with non-integral abutments) common to the central and southeastern United States. The methodology adopted uses 3-D analytical models and nonlinear time-history analyses. An important aspect of the selected methodology is that it considers the contribution of multiple bridge components. The results show that multispan steel girder bridges are the most vulnerable of the considered bridge classes while single-span bridges tend to be the least vulnerable. A comparison of the proposed fragility curves with those currently found in HAZUS-MH shows a strong agreement for the multispan simply supported steel girder bridge class. However, for other simply supported bridge classes (concrete girder, slab), the proposed fragility curves suggest a lower vulnerability level than presented in HAZUS-MH.									98	9	0	1	2	105			8755-2930			WOS:000251517200006

This increased conductivity of electrolyte solution within electrical double layer has never been discussed in previous studies. The resultant intensive heat generation near the capillary wall is demonstrated using numerical simulation to produce not a locally strong temperature rise, but an additional temperature elevation in the whole solution compared to the model neglecting surface conductance. The latter effect is, however, negligible in typicall CE while it might become significant in very small channels.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0173-0835			WOS:000249743500003	17668448

The E. loftini susceptible sugarcane cultivar LCP 85-384 was 1.6-fold more attractive than HoCP 85-845 based on numbers of eggs per egg mass. Egg masses were 9.2-fold more abundant and 2.3-fold larger on sugarcane than on rice. Rice, however, was preferred to sugarcane on a plant biomass basis. Oviposition on sugarcane occurred exclusively on dry leaf material, which increased under drought stress. Egg masses per plant increased on drought stressed sugarcane and were correlated with several foliar free amino acids essential for insect growth and development. The more resistant (based on injury) but more attractive (based on oviposition) rice cultivar XL8 had higher levels of several free amino acids than the susceptible cultivar Cocodrie. The association of host plant characteristics to oviposition preference is discussed. Projected oviposition patterns relative to sugarcane and rice production areas were estimated for Texas and Louisiana based on the availability of each host in different regions of each state. These results suggest that, where sugarcane and rice co-occur, the majority of eggs would be found on sugarcane early in the season, because of this crop's substantially greater biomass compared with rice. Abundance later in the season would also favor sugarcane; however, the abundance on rice would be greater than expected solely based on host availability, largely because of the greater preference per gram of rice plant dry weight.									28	0	0	26	0	28			0046-225X			WOS:000248534900033	17716486

Within and between species variation in male mating behaviors in the mexican sailfin mollies Poecilia velifera and P-Petenensis								ETHOLOGY				113	8			802	812		10.1111/j.1439-0310.2007.01388.x			AUG 2007	2007	Polymorphism in male morphology is often correlated with the expression of alternate behavioral tactics. This relationship between behavioral and morphological polymorphisms, however, is less well understood. We characterized male mating behaviors and morphological variation within and between Poecilia velifera and P. petenensis to understand mating signal evolution in the sailfin molly lineage. In addition, we examined whether differences between these species in the size range of mature males and the strength of allometry between dorsal fin size and body length could explain the variation observed in their expression of different mating behaviors. We determined each male's mating behavior profile by observing the behavior of a single male in the presence of a receptive female. We found that P. velifera showed evidence of an alternate male mating strategy, with small males generally performing only gonopodial thrusts (forced insemination attempts) towards receptive females, while large males performed courtship displays as well as gonopodial thrusts. Males of P. petenensis performed similar rates of courtship displays and gonopodial thrusts regardless of body length. Little variation existed among populations of P. velifera in mating behaviors, while males from different populations of P. petenensis showed population-specific average rates of each mating behavior. Population differences in P. petenensis may be driven, in part, by its occurrence in more variable habitats than those occupied by P. velifera. Variation among individuals in the mating repertoire of P. velifera, but not P. petenensis, suggests that the greater range of variation in male size at maturity, as well as considerably stronger allometry between dorsal fin size and body length, may explain why males of P. velifera show the greatest degree of expression of alternate male mating behaviors when compared to other sailfin species. These results also suggest an important role of morphological polymorphisms in predicting the expression of alternate male mating behaviors.									9	0	0	9	0	9			0179-1613			WOS:000248599100008

The current review paper aims at evaluating alternative in vivo, in vitro and in sacco techniques to simulate reference in vivo results of unprotected PUFA sources, as well as strategies for overcoming or manipulating BH. In vivo rumen sampling approaches show potential but require further investigation, whereas in sacco results are inappropriate. In vitro 24-h batch incubations and continuous cultures approach in vivo BH of unprotected C-18 PUFA sources and are useful to assess the pH value at which dissociation of calcium salts of fatty acids occurs, but overestimate the degree of rumen inertness of formaldehyde-treated oil(seeds) and marine products. Batch or continuous cultures provide an accurate estimate (0.6) of the proportion of hydrogenated C-18 PUFA that are converted into their saturated end-product, except for incubations with high levels of fermentable substrate (> 1.0 g/100 mL) in combination with high amounts of C-18 PUFA(> 0.5 mg/mL) or in incubations with EPA and DHA.									44	0	0	40	1	45			1438-7697			WOS:000249057900002

A duodenal flow dataset was compiled from 25 published studies that provided up to 93 observations on fatty acid intakes and ruminal outflows across a multitude of unprotected and protected fat sources. Control diets with no added fat and diets containing unprotected fat sources had similar and predictable ruminal losses of unsaturated fatty acids (86% for linolenic and oleic acids, and 82% for linoleic acids). Rumen protection technologies that have emerged over the years involve either encapsulation of unsaturated fatty acids inside a microbial-resistant shell (such as formaldehyde-treated or lipid encapsulated), or alteration of fatty acid structure (such as calcium salts or fatty amides) to resist action of microbial enzymes. Calcium salts of fatty acids, because they are available commercially, comprised the majority of observations in the duodenal flow dataset. Meta-analysis of the duodenal dataset that included random study effects revealed only a few instances where protected fat sources gave ruminal losses of polyunsaturated fatty acids that were appreciably lower than what was seen for unprotected fats. Future challenges include enhancing protection characteristics of existing rumen-protected fat sources, and development and commercialization of novel protection strategies.									48	2	0	42	7	53			1438-7697			WOS:000249057900005

A level-2 reformulation-linearization technique bound for the quadratic assignment problem								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH				180	3			983	996		10.1016/j.ejor.2006.03.051			AUG 1 2007	2007	This paper studies polyhedral methods for the quadratic assignment problem. Bounds on the objective value are obtained using mixed 0-1 linear representations that result from a reformulation-linearization technique (rlt). The rlt provides different "levels" of representations that give increasing strength. Prior studies have shown that even the weakest level-1 form yields very tight bounds, which in turn lead to improved solution methodologies. This paper focuses on implementing level-2. We compare level-2 with level-1 and other bounding mechanisms, in terms of both overall strength and ease of computation. In so doing, we extend earlier work on level-1 by implementing a Lagrangian relaxation that exploits block-diagonal structure present in the constraints. The bounds are embedded within an enumerative algorithm to devise an exact solution strategy. Our computer results are notable, exhibiting a dramatic reduction in nodes examined in the enumerative phase, and allowing for the exact solution of large instances. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Skates (N = 80) were sacrificed 12 days after exposure to 0-75 Gy of X-radiation, and morphometrics (body mass, disc width, total length), mass of spleens and epigonal organs, and peripheral blood leucocyte (PBL) counts were compared to controls using ANOVA. Spleen and epigonal organ mass and PBL counts declined logarithmically as a function of radiation dose. To assess recovery from X-radiation, skates (N = 40) were exposed to 0, 9 or 18 Gy and sacrificed when moribund or on days 10, 20, 30 and 40 post-irradiation. Partial recovery of Leydig organ and splenic red pulp was evident after 40 days in skates exposed to 9 Gy, but no indication of recovery was apparent at higher doses. Median lethal dose by 30 days (LD50/30) was calculated to be 9-18 Gy, similar to that determined for other fishes. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Identification of resistance to peppery leaf spot among Brassica juncea and Brassica rapa plant introductions								HORTSCIENCE				42	5			1140	1143					AUG 2007	2007	Brassica leafy greens (Brassica juncea L. and Brassica rapa L.) represent one of the most economically important vegetable crop groups in the southeastern United States. In the last 10 years, numerous occurrences of a leaf-spot disease on these leafy vegetables have been reported in several states. This disease, known as peppery leaf spot, is now causing serious crop losses and has been attributed to the bacterial phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola (Psm). To date, it appears that all cultivars of the Brassica leafy greens are susceptible, and available pesticides for control of this disease appear unable to reduce the disease to acceptable levels. Thus, we undertook a search for potential resistance to this disease among accessions of B. juncea and B. rapa included in the U.S. Plant Introduction (PI) collection. In greenhouse trials, we screened commercial cultivars and 672 U.S. Pis (226 B. juncea and 446 B. rapa) for resistance to Psm with artificial inoculation. Although severity of disease symptoms was significantly different among inoculated accessions, no acceptable levels of resistance were found in any of the more than 400 B. rapa accessions tested. Only two B. juncea accessions (PI 195553 and G 30988) of 226 tested had acceptable levels of resistance that might prove economically useful.

In this framework, correspondence assigns each pixel in an image to exactly one of several non-overlapping regions, and it also computes a displacement function for each region. The framework is better able to capture the scene geometry than the more direct formulation of matching pixels in two or more images, particularly when the surfaces in the scene are not fronto-parallel. To illustrate the framework, we present a specific correspondence algorithm that minimizes an energy functional by alternating between (1) segmenting the image into a number of non-overlapping regions using the multiway-cut algorithm of Boykov, Veksler, and Zabih; and (2) finding the affine parameters describing the displacement of the pixels in each region. After convergence, a final step escapes local minima due to over-segmentation. The basic algorithm is extended in two ways: using ground control points to detect long, thin regions; and warping segmentation results to efficiently process image sequences. Experiments on real images show the algorithm's ability to find an accurate segmentation and displacement map, as well as discontinuities and creases, on a wide variety of stereo and motion imagery.

The convergence theorem uses an a posteriori stopping rule and a modified source condition, without any restriction on the nonlinearity of the operator. The theoretical results are illustrated by simulations for a one-dimensional version of the exponentially ill-posed optical tomography inverse problem for the diffusion (D) and absorption (mu) coefficient spatial distributions. The modified Tikhonov regularization performs the mapping of the minimization variables, which are the coefficients of the spline expansions for D and mu, to physical space. This incorporates the inherently differing scales of these variables in the minimization, and also suggests relative weighting of the regularization terms with respect to each parameter space. The presented modification of the IRGN allows greater flexibility for implementations of IRGN solutions of ill-posed inverse problems in which differing scales in physical space hinder standard IRGN inversions.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0266-5611			WOS:000248186100011		
J	Hong, Ying; Liu, Suibing								HAA formation during chloramination - Significance of monochloramine's direct reaction with DOM								JOURNAL AMERICAN WATER WORKS ASSOCIATION				99	8			57	+					AUG 2007	2007	Three oxidants-monochloramine (NH2Cl) and its two decomposition products, free chlorine (HOCI) and dichloramine (NHCl2)-can be present in water during chloramination, potentially reacting with dissolved organic matter (DOM) to form haloacetic acids (HAAS). This study showed that the direct reaction between NH2Cl and DOM played a major role in the formation of HAAS, accounting for approximately 80% of HAA formation. The remaining HAA formation was attributed to HOCI that resulted from NH2Cl decomposition. No HAA formation was observed from preformed NHCl2. HAA formation was strongly dependent on pH and increased with decreasing pH. This research also found thatthe use of ammonium chloride, the quenching agent recommended by the US Environmental Protection Agency method 552.3 for disinfection by-product samples, resulted in false high HAA determination at early reaction periods. This appears to be the cause of the significantly different kinetic patterns that the literature has reported for HAA formation during chloramination.									28	1	0	26	0	29			0003-150X			WOS:000248644800015

Effect of chronic oxidative/corticosterone-induced stress on ascorbic acid metabolism and total antioxidant capacity in chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus)								JOURNAL OF ANIMAL PHYSIOLOGY AND ANIMAL NUTRITION				91	7-8			355	360		10.1111/j.1439-0396.2006.00662.x			AUG 2007	2007	The consequences of chronic corticosterone-induced stress (CCIS) on ascorbic acid (AsA) metabolism in chickens, an animal that syntheses the vitamin, are not known. This study was conducted to determine whether CCIS alters AsA synthesis, as measured by (L)-gulonolactone oxidase (GLO) activity, tissue AsA, lipid peroxides and tissue total antioxidant capacity (TAC). Stress was induced by dietary administration of corticosterone from 2 to 4 weeks of age and measurements were made at 0, 7 and 14 days post-treatment. Ascorbic acid synthesis was not influenced by CCIS but hepatic, cardiac, renal, bursal and duodenal AsA concentrations were significantly decreased and plasma TAC and uric acid concentrations were significantly elevated. Stress caused significant hepatomegaly and hepatic lipidosis but hepatic peroxides were not elevated despite the slight decrease in hepatic TAC. Tissue TAC varied in different organs. It was markedly elevated in the kidney, reduced by 49% in the spleen, and changes were not detected in the heart and duodenum even though AsA concentration was significantly decreased in all tissues. We conclude that CCIS caused a significant reduction in tissue AsA concentration but did not inhibit GLO activity. The change in AsA concentration was associated with increase, decrease or no change in TAC in tissues examined. The findings suggest that CCIS may alter AsA recycling, influx or turnover in different tissues of chickens.									12	1	0	12	0	12			0931-2439			WOS:000247806900010	17615008

Animal performance and carcass characteristics								JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE				85	8			2012	2018		10.2527/jas.2006-735			AUG 2007	2007	Angus-crossbred steers (n = 216) were used in a 3-yr study to assess the effects of winter stocker growth rate and finishing system on finishing performance and carcass characteristics. During winter months (December to April) steers were randomly allotted to 3 stocker growth rates: low (0.23 kgmental unit, and year was considered a random effect. Winter stocker phase treatments resulted in differences (P < 0.001) in final BW, ADG, and ultrasound LM area between all treatments for that phase. Pasture-finished cattle had lower (P < 0.001) final BW, ADG, HCW, LM area, fat thickness, KPH, dressing percent, USDA yield grade, and USDA quality grade. Winter stocker treatment influenced (P < 0.05) final BW and HCW, with low and medium being less than high. Steers with low stocker gain had greater (P < 0.05) finishing ADG. Dressing percent was greater (P < 0.001) for high than low, and USDA quality grade was greater (P < 0.05) for high than low and medium. Carcass LM area, fat thickness, KPH, and USDA yield grade were not influenced (P > 0.05) by winter rate of gain. Cattle on low during winter exhibited compensatory gain during finishing but were unable to catch the high group regarding BW or HCW. The USDA quality grade was greater for high than low or medium.

Upon completion of the winter phase, steers were randomly allotted within each stocker treatment to a corn silage-concentrate or pasture finishing system. All steers regardless of finishing treatment were finished to an equal-time endpoint to eliminate confounding of treatments with animal age or seasonal factors. Upon completion of the finishing period, steers were slaughtered in 2 groups (one-half of pasture and one-half of feedlot cattle each time) and carcass data were collected. Winter data were analyzed as a completely randomized design, with winter treatment, pen replicate, year, and the winter x year interaction in the model. Finishing performance and carcass data were analyzed in a split-plot design with finishing system in the whole plot, and winter growth rate and winter x finish in the split-plot. Winter treatment mean within finishing replication was the experimental unit, and year was considered a random effect. Winter stocker phase treatments resulted in differences (P < 0.001) in final BW, ADG, and ultrasound LM area between all treatments for that phase. Pasture-finished cattle had lower (P < 0.001) final BW, ADG, HCW, LM area, fat thickness, KPH, dressing percent, USDA yield grade, and USDA quality grade. Winter stocker treatment influenced (P < 0.05) final BW and HCW, with low and medium being less than high. Steers with low stocker gain had greater (P < 0.05) finishing ADG.

Carcass LM area, fat thickness, KPH, and USDA yield grade were not influenced (P > 0.05) by winter rate of gain. Cattle on low during winter exhibited compensatory gain during finishing but were unable to catch the high group regarding BW or HCW. The USDA quality grade was greater for high than low or medium.Animal performance during the winter stocker period clearly impacts finishing performance, carcass quality and beef productin in both pasture- and feedlot-finishing systems, when cattle were finished to an equal-time endpoint.									18	0	0	16	0	18			0021-8812			WOS:000248043600020	17468429

While results suggested that occupational attachment had a minimal impact, the extent to which expectations of civilian work, financial, and family aspects of life were met emerged as significant predictors of satisfaction and adjustment after military retirement. These findings suggest that the characteristics of the post-retirement environment, and expectations regarding this environment, outweigh the importance of occupational attachment in determining post-retirement adjustment in this setting.									19	0	0	1	0	19			0021-9029			WOS:000248543900003		
J	Nichols, Heather L.; Zhang, Ning; Zhang, Jing; Shi, Donglu; Bhaduri, Sarit; Wen, Xuejun								Coating nanothickness degradable films on nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite particles to improve the bonding strength between nanohydroxyapatite and degradable polymer matrix								JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A				82A	2			373	382		10.1002/jbm.a.31066			AUG 2007	2007	Hydroxyapatite (HA) nanoparticles are similar to bone apatite in size, phase composition, and crystal structure. When compared with micron-size HA particles, nano-HA possesses improved mechanical properties and superior bioactivity for promoting bone growth and regeneration. However, scaffolds fabricated from nano-HA alone cannot meet the mechanical requirements for direct-loading applications. A number of studies suggest that nanostructured composites may offer surface and/or chemical properties of native bone, and therefore represent ideal substrates to support bone regeneration. However, a common problem with nanchydroxyapatite (nano-HA)-polymer composites is the weak binding strength between the nano-HA filler and the polymer matrix since they are two different categories of materials and cannot form covalent bonds between them during the mixing process. Often, the mechanical strength of the composite is compromised due to the phase separation of the HA filler from the polymer matrix during the tissue repair process. To overcome this problem, an ultrathin degradable polymer film was grafted onto the surface of nano-HA using a radio-frequency plasma polymerization technology from acrylic acid monomers. The treated nano-HA powders are expected to bind to the polymer matrix via covalent bonds, thus enhancing the mechanical properties of the resultant composites. Highresolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) experiments showed that an extremely thin polymer film (2 nm) was uniformly deposited on the surfaces of the nanoparticles. The FIRTEM results were confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (TOFSIMS). Tensile tests performed on the specimens revealed that the degradable coating had improved elastic and strength properties when compared with the nondegradable and uncoated controls. XPS and TOSIMS data revealed that more functional carboxyl groups were formed on degradable coatings than cross-linked nondegradable coatings. Cytocompatibility assay demonstrated that both the degradable and nondegradable coatings are cytocompatible.

Comparison of solvation-effect methods for the simulation of peptide interactions with a hydrophobic surface								JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY				28	11			1883	1892		10.1002/jcc.20716			AUG 2007	2007	In this study we investigated the interaction behavior between thirteen different small peptides and a hydrophobic surface using three progressively more complex methods of representing solvation effects: a united-atom implicit solvation method [CHARMM 19 force field (C19) with Analytical Continuum Electrostatics (ACE)], an all-atom implicit solvation method (C22 with GBMV), and an all-atom explicit solvation method (C22 with TIP3P). The adsorption behavior of each peptide was characterized by the calculation of the potential of mean force as a function of peptide-surface separation distance. The results from the C22/TIP3P model suggest that hydrophobic peptides exhibit relatively strong adsorption behavior, polar and positively-charged peptides exhibit negligible to relatively weak favorable interactions with the surface, and negatively-charged peptides strongly resist adsorption. Compared to the TIP3P model, the ACE and GBMV implicit solvent models predict much stronger attractions for the hydrophobic peptides as well as stronger repulsions for the negatively-charged peptides on the CH3-SAM surface. These comparisons provide a basis from which each of these implicit solvation methods may be reparameterized to provide closer agreement with explicitly represented solvation in simulations of peptide and protein adsorption to functionalized surfaces.

Threecornered alfalfa hopper (Hemiptera : Membracidae): Seasonal occurrence, girdle distribution, and response to insecticide treatment on peanut in South Carolina								JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY				100	4			1229	1240		10.1603/0022-0493(2007)100[1229:TAHHMS]2.0.CO;2			AUG 2007	2007	A survey of threecornered alfalfa hopper, Spissistilus festinus (Say) (Hemiptera: Membracidae), damage in 60 South Carolina peanut, Arachis hypogaea L., fields showed that 89 and 58% of plants had feeding girdles during 2003 and 2004, respectively. Use of a foliar insecticide for other target pests reduced hopper damage. Hopper damage was not affected by sampling distance from the field edge; therefore, injury was adequately assessed at 10 m from field borders. In-furrow insecticide choice, planting date, soil texture, previous crop, or tillage did not measurably affect girdling. Subsequent field experiments demonstrated a cultivar effect on threecornered alfalfa hopper injury, with the standard runner-type cultivar ('Georgia Green') more susceptible than the standard Virginia-type ('NC-V11'). More than 50% of stem girdling occurred on the basal quarter (first five internodes) of the plant. Most feeding occurred on secondary branches of main and lateral stems. Weekly sampling of seven grower fields showed that adult hoppers colonize peanut during June and produce two generations on peanut. Only low levels of plant girding were observed in June, but plant girdling increased gradually through late July, when girdling markedly increased contemporary with peak populations of first generation nymphs and adults. A second increase in plant girdling, observed in early September, coincided with the second generation of nymphs on peanut. Foliar treatments at 45-60 d after planting (DAP) were most effective in suppressing injury. Granular chlorpyrifos treatment also suppressed hopper injury. There was no yield response to insecticide treatments at the hopper injury levels in these tests (up to six girdles per plant). Although the economic injury level (EIL) for this pest has not been defined, our data indicate that a critical interval for monitoring hopper activity is the first 3 wk of July, before the occurrence of significant injury. Where growers have a consistent risk of economic injury, applying foliar treatment in mid-July would be most effective in suppressing damage.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0022-0493			WOS:000248583700029	17849875	
J	Yang, Hua; Qu, Liangwei; Wimbrow, Adrienne; Jiang, Xiuping; Sun, Ya-Ping				yang, Hua/K-6017-2012				Enhancing antimicrobial activity of lysozyme against Listeria monocytogenes using immunonanoparticles								JOURNAL OF FOOD PROTECTION				70	8			1844	1849					AUG 2007	2007	The antimicrobial efficacy of lysozyme may be reduced by undesirable interactions with food components and nontarget bacteria. Immunonanoparticles, i.e., nanoparticles functionalized with pathogen-specific antibodies, may serve as an antimicrobial carrier for improving the stability and activity of antimicrobials in foods. The objective of this research was to study the antimicrobial activity of lysozyme-carrying immunonanoparticles against Listeria monocytogenes. Polystyrene nanoparticles with active carboxyl groups were conjugated with anti-L. monocytogenes antibody through covalent bonding. Enhanced antimicrobial activity of lysozyme-carrying immunonanoparticles was achieved when 0.04 mu g/ml anti-L. monocytogenes antibody was used for coating nanoparticles and the resulting immunonanoparticles were then coated with lysozyme for 6 h. Lysozyme-carrying immunonanoparticles with a final concentration of 35 mu g/ml reduced L. monocytogenes Scott A populations from ca. 5 log CFU/ml to below the detection limit (< 1 log CFU/ml) within 3 h. However, when 500 mu g/ml lysozyme was used, ca. 2 log CFU/ml concentration of L. monocytogenes cells remained culturable after 5 h of treatment. The addition of lysozyme-carrying immunonanoparticles (37 mu g/ml) to an L. monocytogenes solution of ca. 7 log CFU/ml for 6 h resulted in 0.9-, 1.0-, and 2.3-log greater reductions of L monocytogenes cells than that achieved with lysozyme-carrying nanoparticles and lysozyme solutions of 500 and 50 mu g/ml, respectively. Overall, lysozyme-carrying immunonanoparticles had significantly more anti-L. monocytogenes activity (P < 0.05) than did lysozyme-carrying nanoparticles and lysozyme solutions at higher concentrations (500 and 50 mu g/ml). Our study revealed that the use of lysozyme-carrying immunonanoparticles is more effective than direct addition of lysozyme for inactivating L. monocytogenes in nutrient broth.									10	0	0	4	0	10			0362-028X			WOS:000248519000009	17803140

For both systems the measured energy losses were unusually small. In the case of the Ar measurements some of the angular distributions exhibited an anomalous shoulder feature in addition to a broad peak near the specular direction, and quantum mechanical diffraction was observed under conditions for which it was not expected. These measurements are analysed and compared to calculations with a mixed quantum-classical scattering theory. This theory uses classical mechanics to describe the translational and rotational degrees of freedom while internal molecular vibrational modes are treated quantum mechanically. Many of the unusual features observed in the measurements are explained, but only upon using an effective surface mass of 2.3 Ru atomic masses, which implies collective effects in the Ru crystal. The large effective mass, because it leads to substantially larger Debye-Waller factors, explains and confirms the observations of diffraction features. It also leads to the interesting conclusion that Ru is a metal for which molecular beam scattering measurements in the purely quantum mechanical regime, where diffraction and single-single-phonon creation are dominant, should be possible not only with He atoms, but with many other atomic and molecular species with larger masses.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0953-8984			WOS:000248185600008

This paper describes improved methods for sequence-independent synthesis of full-length cDNA copies of dsRNA genes and associated sequencing strategies. These methods include an improved version of the 'Single Primer Amplification Technique' (SPAT - [Attoui, H., Billoir, F., Cantaloube, J.F., Biagini, P., de Micco, P. and de Lamballerie, X., 2000. Strategies for the sequence determination of viral dsRNA genomes. J. Virol. Methods 89, 147-158]), which is described here as 'Full-Length Amplification of cDNAs' (FLAC). They also include the development of direct sequencing methods (without cloning) for the resulting full-length cDNAs. These techniques, which are applicable to any viruses with segmented dsRNA genomes and conserved RNA termini, make it possible to generate sequence data rapidly from multiple isolates for molecular epidemiology studies.

Four experimental units, each >14 ha, were contained within each of 3 replicate blocks at the Green River Game Land, Polk County, North Carolina, USA. Treatments were 1) prescribed burn, 2) mechanical understory reduction (chainsaw-felling of shrubs and small trees), 3) mechanical + burn, and 4) controls. We conducted mechanical treatments in winter 2001-2002 and prescribed burns in spring 2003. Tall shrub cover was substantially reduced in all treatments compared to controls. Tree mortality and canopy openness was highest in the mechanical + burn treatment after burning, likely due to higher fuel loading and hotter burns; tree mortality increased with time. Many bird species did not detectably decrease or increase in response to treatments. Species richness, total bird density, and some species, including indigo buntings (Passerina cyanea) and eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis), increased in the mechanical + burn treatment after a 1-year to 2-year delay; eastern wood-pewees (Contopus virens) increased immediately after treatment. Hooded warblers (Wilsonia citrina), black-and-white warblers (Mniotilta varia), and worm-eating warblers (Helmitheros vermivorus) declined temporarily in some or all treatments, likely in response to understory and (or) leaf litter depth reductions. Densities of most species affected by treatments varied with shrub cover, tree or snag density, or leaf litter depth. High snag availability, open conditions, and a higher density of flying insects in the mechanical + burn treatment likely contributed to increased bird density and species richness. In our study, fuel reduction treatments that left the canopy intact, such as low-intensity prescribed fire or mechanical understory removal, had few detectable effects on breeding birds compared to the mechanical + burn treatment. High-intensity burning with heavy tree-kill, as occurred in our mechanical + burn treatment, can be used as a management tool to increase densities of birds associated with open habitat while retaining many forest and generalist species, but may have short-term adverse effects on some species that are associated with the ground- or shrub-strata for nesting and foraging.									20	4	0	21	0	26			0022-541X			WOS:000248655400021

These models are eminently effective for an economy premised on physical production but are not well-suited for a more knowledge-oriented economy. Complexity science suggests a different paradigm for leadersbip-one that frames leadership as a complex interactive dynamic from which adaptive outcomes (e.g., learning, innovation, and adaptability) emerge. This article draws from complexity science to develop an overarching framework for the study of Complexity Leadership Theory, a leadership paradigm that focuses on enabling the learning, creative, and adaptive capacity of complex adaptive systems (CAS) within a context of knowledge-producing organizations. This conceptual framework includes three entangled leadership roles (i.e., adaptive leadership, administrative leadership, and enabling leadership) that reflect a dynamic relationship between the bureaucratic, administrative functions of the organization and the emergent, informal dynamics of complex adaptive systems (CAS).

Chefs' opinions of restaurant portion sizes								OBESITY				15	8			2086	2094		10.1038/oby.2007.248			AUG 2007	2007	Objectives: The objectives were to determine who establishes restaurant portion sizes and factors that influence these decisions, and to examine chefs' opinions regarding portion size, nutrition information, and weight management.Research Methods and Procedures: A survey was distributed to chefs to obtain information about who is responsible for determining restaurant portion sizes, factors influencing restaurant portion sizes, what food portion sizes are being served in restaurants, and chefs' opinions regarding nutrition information, health, and body weight. The final sample consisted of 300 chefs attending various culinary meetings.Results: Executive chefs were identified as being primarily responsible for establishing portion sizes served in restaurants. Factors reported to have a strong influence on restaurant portion sizes included presentation of foods, food cost, and customer expectations. While 76% of chefs thought that they served "regular" portions, the actual portions of steak and pasta they reported serving were 2 to 4 times larger than serving sizes recommended by the U.S government. Chefs indicated that they believe that the amount of food served influences how much patrons consume and that large portions are a problem for weight control, but their opinions were mixed regarding whether it is the customer's responsibility to eat an appropriate amount when served a large portion of food.Discussion: Portion size is a key determinant of energy intake, and the results from this study suggest that cultural norms and economic value strongly influence the determination of restaurant portion sizes. Strategies are needed to encourage chefs to provide and promote portions that are appropriate for customers' energy requirements.									23	0	0	9	0	23			1930-7381			WOS:000249001800024	17712127

Anticancer activity of limonoid from Khaya senegalensis								PHYTOTHERAPY RESEARCH				21	8			731	734		10.1002/ptr.2148			AUG 2007	2007	Two limonoids were isolated from the methanol extract of Khaya senegalensis (Meliaceae), and their structures were identified as 3 alpha,7 alpha-dideacetylkhivorin (1) and 1-O-acetylkhayanolide B (2) on the basis of MS and NMR spectral data. Complete assignments of H-1 and C-13 chemical shifts for compounds 1 and 2 were achieved by means of ID and 2D NMR including DEPT, H-1-H-1 COSY, HMQC, HMBC experiments. Compound I showed significant growth inhibitory activities against MCF-7, SiHa and Caco-2 cells with IC50 values in the range of 0.07-0.14 mu m (35-69 ppm) while compound 2 did not.

J	McDonell, James R.								Neighborhood characteristics, parenting, and children's safety								SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH				83	1			177	199		10.1007/s11205-006-9063-5			AUG 2007	2007	Recent studies highlight the importance of neighborhood context for child and family well-being. Yet challenges to research on neighborhood effects remain; research on young children is sparse, as is research on neighborhood effects on parenting. Measurement also continues to challenge researchers, particularly in devising non-invasive means of gauging neighborhood characteristics. The present study seeks to address these issues by using data from a newly developed observational measure of neighborhood characteristics to examine parent reports of the safety of neighborhood children in the home and self-reports of parenting. The results showed that neighborhood characteristics accounted for 23% of the variance in parent perceptions of children's safety in the home, with neighborhood physical appearance strongly predicting children's safety. Neighborhood effects on self-reported parenting were more modest, accounting for just 6% of the variance in parents' reports of nurturing interactions with their children; vigilance for the safety of the neighborhood was a significant predictor. The study has implications for observational measurement of neighborhood effects and for policy and program practices to improve child and family well-being through neighborhood change.									29	0	0	0	1	29			0303-8300	1573-0921		WOS:000246758800010		
J	Lee, Sungho; Kim, Tack-Rae; Ogale, Amod A.; Kim, Myung-Soo								Surface and structure modification of carbon nanofibers								SYNTHETIC METALS				157	16-17			644	650		10.1016/j.synthmet.2007.07.005			AUG 2007	2007	The micro-structure of reinforcements, including surface characteristics, plays a critical role in the properties of composite materials that are ultimately produced. The purpose of this work is to investigate the micro-structure of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) with different core structures, which are hollow (PR) and solid (MJ) fibers, as a function of two treatments: CVD and thermal. From Raman spectroscopy and XRD analyses, an increase of crystallite thickness and width was observed after a heat treatment at 2200 degrees C for both types of fibers. Further, there was a more significant enhancement of crystalline structure in PR fibers. Also, an increase in thermal oxidation stability for heat-treated CNFs was observed. BET adsorption isotherms showed a significant reduction of specific surface area of MJ fibers after the heat treatment and also after the CVD surface treatment, resulting from the decrease of pore volume. However, even after heat treatment, MJ fibers possessed rougher surface than did PR fibers. Further, significant spatial discontinuity was observed with TEM micrographs due to reorganization of graphene layers during heat treatment for the both heat-treated CNFs. These results suggest that surface and structure of CNFs are important for maximizing their role in the performances of nanocomposites. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

First, the expansion of the IR at the SSC/IRa boundary that duplicates a portion of the 5' end of ndhH is restricted to the three genera of the subfamily Pooideae (Agrostis, Hordeum and Triticum). Second, a 6 bp deletion in ndhK is shared by Agrostis, Hordeum, Oryza and Triticum, and this event supports the sister relationship between the subfamilies Erhartoideae and Pooideae. Repeat analysis identified 1937 direct and inverted repeats 30 bp or longer with a sequence identity of at least 90%. Seventeen of the 26 shared repeats are found in all the grass chloroplast genomes examined and are located in the same genes or intergenic spacer (IGS) regions. Examination of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) identified 16-21 potential polymorphic SSRs. Five IGS regions have 100% sequence identity among Zea mays, Saccharum officinarum and Sorghum bicolor, whereas no spacer regions were identical among Oryza sativa, Triticum aestivum, H. vulgare and A. stolonifera despite their close phylogenetic relationship. Alignment of EST sequences and DNA coding sequences identified six C-U conversions in both Sorghum bicolor and H. vulgare but only one in A. stolonifera. Phylogenetic trees based on DNA sequences of 61 protein-coding genes of 38 taxa using both maximum parsimony and likelihood methods provide moderate support for a sister relationship between the subfamilies Erhartoideae and Pooideae.									81	8	0	83	0	325			0040-5752			WOS:000249207100013	17534593

These phosphoprotein producing cells are concentrated along the mantle side facing the shell, in the region of the outer mantle lobe. A layer of calcium enriched immuno-reactive mucous is associated with the apical microvilli of these cells. The 48 kDa phosphoprotein forms a component of the fibrous organic matrix and appears to be involved in calcium supply thus enabling crystal growth at the mineralization front. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Under both common garden and warm greenhouse conditions (day/niaht temperature of 33 /25 degrees C), the Florida genotype exhibited more -rowth than the Minnesota genotype. To determine the physiological parameters associated with this response, plants were acclimated to ambient (27/25 degrees C) or rnoderately elevated (33/25 degrees C) temperatures for 21 days before measurement of net photosynthesis at temperatures ranging from 25 to 48 degrees C. In vivo measurements of gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence of ambient-acclirnated plants revealed that, compared with the Minnesota genotype, the Florida genotype maintained a higher photosynthetic rate, higher stomata] conductance, more open PSII reaction centers, a greater PSII quantam yield and a lower quantum requirement for photosystern II (phi(PSII)) per mole of CO2 fixed (phi (Co2)) throughout the measurement temperature range. When both genotypes were acclimated at 33/25 degrees C and measured at 33 degrees C,,enot\ pes wei analysis of the response of net photosynthesis to calculated intercellular CO, concentration indicated that the maximal rate of Rubisco carboxylation (V-cmax) decreased more in the Minnesota genotype than in the Florida genotype in response to elevated temperature. Additionally, phi(PSII),/phi(co2). at 33 degrees C was markedly hiaher for Minnesota plants under photorespiratory conditions. but similar to Florida plants under non-photorespiratory conditions. The results indicate that the higher net photosvnthetic rate at 33/25 degrees C of the Florida genotype compared with the Minnesota genotype could be a result of several mechanisms. including the maintenance of a hi-her V-cmax and a more efficient quantum requirement of PSII per mole of CO, fixed. which is likely the result of lower photorespiration.									28	1	0	26	0	29			0829-318X			WOS:000248740800002	17472935

Previous studies have indicated that effective matrix diffusion coefficient values obtained from a number of field tracer tests are enhanced in comparison with local values and may increase with test scale. In this communication, we develop analytical expressions for the effective matrix diffusion coefficient for two simple fracture-matrix systems and demonstrate that heterogeneities in the rock matrix at different scales may contribute to the scale dependence of the effective matrix diffusion coefficient.									10	1	0	1	0	10			1539-1663			WOS:000249015500024

One point pattern analysis method, O-ring statistics, was used to analyze the spatial patterns of the species in three vertical layers, i. e., overstory, midstory and understory layers, and the spatial associations of intra- and inter-species between different vertical layers were studied. The results showed that P. koraiensis and T. amurensis were clumped at smaller scales. Higher layers tended to be randomly or regularly distributed, while lower layers tended to be aggregated at smaller scales. The aggregation degree decreased with canopy height. P. koraiensis stems in overstory layer were significantly positively associated to the stems in midstory layer at scales < 11 m, and T. amurensis in overstory layer showed negatively correlation with that in midstory and understory layers. There was generally a positive correlation between the two species, but the association varied among different layers. No significant correlation was observed between P. koraiensis stems in overstory layer and T. amurensis in three layers. P. koraiensis stems in midstory layer showed slightly negative correlation with T. amurensis in the same layer at scales > 4 in, but no significant association to T.. amurensis in understroy layer. T. amurensis in overstory layer was significantly positively associated to P. koraiensis in midstory layer at scales < 100 m.									10	97	0	47	0	108			1001-9332	1001-9332		BCI:BCI200800036664

Although the origin of definitive endoderm has been mapped in the chick, arising principally from rostral streak at elongating streak stages, it is not known when this layer first becomes fully committed to its germ layer fate, an important issue to resolve in light of its critical role in subsequent patterning of the early embryo.Results: Through gene expression screening of chick gastrula, we identified molecular markers of definitive endoderm restricted to rostral ( Sox17) and caudal ( Gata5/ 6) regions, suggesting that at least two subpopulations of definitive endodermal cells exist during ingression. We show ( 1) that presumptive mesoderm cells migrate to the middle layer and remain mesenchymal when transplanted to rostral primitive streak, and prospective endoderm cells enter the lower layer and become epithelial when transplanted to caudal primitive streak; and ( 2) that presumptive endoderm cells and mesoderm cells lose normal gene expression ( Sox17 and Wnt8c, respectively) when transplanted outside of their normal position of origin. Moreover, when rostral or caudal primitive streak segments are transplanted into rostral blastoderm isolates ( RBIs), both types of transplants express Sox17 4 - 6 hours later - consistent with their new position, regardless of their presumptive germ layer origin - and prospective mesoderm transplants, which normally express Wnt8c, turn off expression, suggesting that signals within the rostral blastoderm induce endoderm gene expression, and repress mesoderm gene expression, during gastrulation.Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that germ layer identity is fixed at the time populations of endoderm and mesoderm cells ingress through the primitive streak, whereas their gene expression patterns remain labile. In addition, our results show that inductive and repressive signals are present, and that these signals regulate gene expression of both ingressed endoderm and mesoderm cells. Thus, gastrula cells display elements of both pre- patterning and plasticity, with endoderm the first germ layer becoming committed to its fate during early gastrulation stages.									12	1	0	11	0	13			1471-213X			WOS:000250056700001	17663788

Highly gas permselective polyetherketone hollow fibre membranes using aqueous sulfuric acid solution as coagulant								E-POLYMERS										076				JUL 30 2007	2007	Hollow fibre membranes with more sponge-like morphology and improved gas permeation performance were spun from 20% polyetherketone (PEK) /sulfuric acid (H2SO4) dope solution with aqueous sulfuric acid solution as coagulant using dry-jet wet spinning process. The membrane morphology, mechanical properties and gas separation performance (hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide) of as-spun PEK hollow fibres have been measured using SEM, Instron and gas test rig. Better cross section structures and mechanical properties in as-spun PEK hollow fibres were observed when aqueous sulfuric acid solution replaced water as coagulant (internal and external). The hydrogen/methane selectivity of up to 40 and hydrogen permeation rate of 3.65 GPU obtained in PEK hollow fibre membranes using 30% sulfuric acid solution as internal and external coagulant simultaneously at the bore fluid injection rate of 30 ml/h are higher than those reported in literatures. Furthermore the effects of bore fluid injection rate and various coagulants on the membrane morphology, mechanical properties and gas separation properties were investigated, as well.									0	0	1	0	0	1			1618-7229			WOS:000248561700002

Whereas recent tunneling experiments suggest a room temperature RBM lifetime as long as 10 ns , previous Raman experiments yield lifetimes shorter than 2 ps. The lifetimes obtained in this study are longer than 5 ps-a significant step in the direction of the tunneling results. We argue that the remaining discrepancy is due to the existence of phonon decay bottlenecks caused by the one-dimensional nature of nanotubes. Numerical simulations of the RBM decay show that it is possible to reconcile the short lifetimes measured spectroscopically with the long lifetimes obtained in tunneling experiments.									15	0	0	0	0	15			0031-9007			WOS:000248345800065	17678403	
J	Iacono, Scott T.; Budy, Stephen M.; Mabry, Joseph M.; Smith, Dennis W., Jr.								Synthesis, characterization, and properties of chain terminated polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane-functionalized perfluorocyclobutyl aryl ether copolymers								POLYMER				48	16			4637	4645		10.1016/j.polymer.2007.06.022			JUL 27 2007	2007	A new class of perfluorocyclobutyl (PFCB) polymers covalently functionalized with polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) is presented. Three discreetly functionalized POSS monomers possessing thermally reactive trifluorovinyl aryl ether (TFVE) were prepared in good yields. The POSS TFVE monomers were prepared by initial corner-capping of cyclopentyl (-C5H9), iso-butyl (-CH2CH(CH3)(2)), or trifluoropropyl (-CH2CH2CF3) functionalized POSS trisilanols with acetoxyethyltrichlorosilane followed by sequential acid-catalyzed deprotection and coupling with 4-(trifluorovinyloxy)benzoic acid. TFVE-functionalized POSS monomers were thermally polymerized with 4,4'-bis(4-trifluorovinyloxy)biphenyl or 2,2-bis(4-trifluorovinyloxybiphenyl)-1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoropropane monomers via a condensate-free, [2+2] step-growth polymerization. The polymerization afforded solution processable PFCB polymers with POSS macromer installed on the polymer chain ends. POSS monomers and their corresponding copolymers were characterized by H-1, C-13, F-19, and Si-29 NNIR, GPC, ATR-FTIR, and elemental combustion analysis. GPC trace analysis showed agreeable number-average molecular weight for various weight percent of cyclopentyl or iso-butyl and trifluoropropyl chain terminated POSS PFCB copolymers. DSC analysis showed the introduction of increasing POSS weight percent in the endcapped PFC13 copolyrners lowers the glass transition temperatures as high as 31 degrees C. On the other hand, the trifluoropropyl POSS endcapped PFC13 polymer glass transition temperature was unaffected when copolymerized with the more fluorinated 2,2-bis(4-trifluorovinyloxybiphenyl)-1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoropropane monomer. TGA analysis of POSS PFC13 copolymers showed step-wise decomposition of copolymers resulting from the initial degradation of the POSS cages at 297-355 degrees C in nitrogen and air which was confirmed by pyrolysis coupled with GC-NIS. This initial weight loss was proportional to the weight percent of POSS incorporated into the polymer. The balance of decomposition was observed at 450-563 degrees C in nitrogen and air which is higher than the PFCB homopolymers in most cases. Polymer surface characterization was performed on spin cast transparent, flexible films. These composite films exhibited good POSS dispersion within the matrix PFC13 polymer as was shown by TEM analysis. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

HR 4049: The winnowing flow observed?								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				664	1			501	517		10.1086/518682			JUL 20 2007	2007	High-resolution infrared spectroscopy in the 2.3Y4.6 mu m region is reported for the peculiar A supergiant, single-lined spectroscopic binary HR 4049. Lines from the CO fundamental and first overtone, OH fundamental, and several H2O vibration-rotation transitions have been observed in the near-infrared spectrum. The spectrum of HR 4049 appears principally in emission through the 3 and 4.6 mu m region and in absorption in the 2 mu m region. The 4.6 mu m spectrum shows a rich " forest'' of emission lines. All the spectral lines observed in the 2.3Y4.6 mu m spectrum are shown to be circumbinary in origin. The presence of OH and H2O lines confirm the oxygen-rich nature of the circumbinary gas, which is in contrast to the previously detected carbon-rich material. The emission and absorption line profiles show that the circumbinary gas is located in a thin, rotating layer near the dust disk. The properties of the dust and gas circumbinary disk and the spectroscopic orbit yield masses for the individual stars, M-AI similar to 0.58 M-circle dot and M-secondary similar to 0.34 M-circle dot. Gas in the disk also has an outward flow with a velocity of greater than or similar to kms-(1). The severe depletion of refractory elements but near-solar abundances of volatile elements observed in HR 4049 results from abundance winnowing. The separation of the volatiles from the grains in the disk and the subsequent accretion by the star are discussed. Contrary to prior reports, the HR 4049 carbon and oxygen isotopic abundances are typical AGB values, C-12/C-13 =6(-4)(+9) and O-16/O-17 > 200.									22	0	0	0	0	22			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000248002400045

It has been repeatedly measured in the bulk by a variety of methods, but its origin is still highly debated. Here we present first experimental evidence of the boson peak on the nu-SiO2 surface. The measurements were obtained by helium atom scattering. The boson peak appears as a dispersionless mode of approximate to 4 meV in the recorded time-of-flight spectra. It is clearly identified as an excess contribution to the low energy Debye-like region in the surface phonon spectral density which is extracted from the time-of-flight spectra using a straightforward theoretical model.									10	1	0	0	0	10			0031-9007			WOS:000248194700025	17678295

According to results from the characterization with various instrumental techniques, these soluble fractions and the final residue all have different nanotube diameter distributions from that found in the starting sample. A general conclusion is that the functionalization and solubilization are selective toward smaller diameter nanotubes, regardless of their being semiconducting or metallic. Mechanistic implications, especially with respect to the post-production separation in terms of the nanotube metallicity, are discussed.									8	0	0	1	0	8			1932-7447			WOS:000247966700023

Biswas, Pablo/B-4835-2012				An optimal batch size for an imperfect production system with quality assurance and rework								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH				45	14			3191	3214		10.1080/00207540600711853			JUL 15 2007	2007	We consider a manufacturing system which receives raw material from a Supplier, processes it, and delivers it to the customer periodically. The system considered is imperfect and produces defectives at a constant rate. The finished product can only be delivered if the whole lot is quality-certified. Hence, defectives have to be reworked, and the whole lot quality-checked within the cycle. Three different scenarios are considered, viz. (a) a single lot of raw material for multiple lot of finished product and delivery of the product in multiple instalments, (b) a single lot of raw material for a multiple lot of finished product and delivery of the product in a single instalment, and (c) lot-for-lot and delivery of finished product in single instalment. A total cost equation is developed for each model, and the optimal ordering quantities are evaluated. The results found are encouraging and quite simple to use for practical purposes.									25	1	0	0	0	25			0020-7543			WOS:000247780400006

These layers have potential applications in GaAs based tandem solar cells that utilize the near infrared region of the solar spectrum. The epilayers were grown in an elemental solid source molecular beam epitaxy system with a rf plasma nitrogen source. The Sb and N compositions of the nearly lattice-matched layers are 6.8% and 2.6%, respectively, as determined by high resolution x-ray diffraction and secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) analysis. The high crystalline quality of the layers is attested by the presence of well resolved Pendellosung fringes on a triple axis (004) x-ray scan and dynamical truncation rods observed on the corresponding (004) reciprocal space map. The effects of in situ annealing in As ambient and ex situ annealing in N ambient on the low temperature photoluminescence (PL) characteristics are discussed. Ex situ (in situ) annealed samples display an 8 K PL peak energy of 1 eV with a full width at half maximum of 18 meV (26 meV). Raman spectral analysis, the temperature dependence of the PL peak energy, and SIMS profiles indicate that outdiffusions of N and As are suppressed in the in situ annealed samples and improvement in Ga-N bonding is observed, leading to higher PL intensities in these samples. In addition, indirect evidence of atomic scale ordering has been observed. The stability of these structures appears to be dependent on the annealing conditions.

J	Chen, Wei; Wang, Tao; Lickfield, Gary C.								Molecular modeling of cellulose in amorphous state. III. An innovative elastomeric crosslink system								JOURNAL OF POLYMER SCIENCE PART B-POLYMER PHYSICS				45	14			1821	1833		10.1002/polb.21214			JUL 15 2007	2007	The flexibility of molecular structures of rubber materials was evaluated using molecular modeling techniques to develop new crosslink agents which improve deformation recovery of cellulose without significant loss of the mechanical strength. Among the studied structures Poly(propylene oxide) (PPO) pentamer appears to be the most flexible and coiled one. Our calculation results showed that, cellulose crosslinked with PPO pentamers had similar deformation recovery to that crosslinked with DMDHEU. No conformation transitions were observed in these crosslinks when cellulose models were extended to 15% strain, which is consistent with the previous result that conformation transitions in crosslinks should be avoided upon extension to achieve a good recovery on crosslinked cellulose. In addition, PPO crosslinks did not significantly affect the breaking strain of cellulose based upon the cavity volume calculations, and they helped to remove the stress concentration among cellulose chains as suggested by the results of hydrogen bonding analysis. Thus, breaking strength of cellulose might not be significantly affected by PPO crosslinks as well. The preliminary experimental results confirmed above observations. Therefore, PPO pentamer appears to be a promising elastomeric backbone structure of crosslinking agents. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.									3	0	0	1	0	3			0887-6266			WOS:000247763200008		
J	Walters, Keisha B.; Hirt, Douglas E.								Synthesis and characterization of a tertiary amine polymer series from surface-grafted poly(tert-butyl acrylate) via diamine reactions								MACROMOLECULES				40	14			4829	4838		10.1021/ma0700882			JUL 10 2007	2007	A sequence of reaction steps was used to graft poly(tert-butyl acrylate) (PtBA) to silicon (Si) wafers and to modify the pendant groups of the tethered PtBA to create chemically tailored surface modifying layers. The Si wafers were first prepared for grafting by the deposition of a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of N-aminopropyldimethylethoxysilane. The terminal primary amine groups on the SAM provided sites for reaction with carboxy-terminated PtBA. The choice of PtBA as the tethered polymer was due to the ability to substitute the tert-butyl ester groups with other functionalities. In this study, the tert-butyl esters were replaced with various diamines to create a series of polymers with tertiary amine pendant groups. The reactions and surface properties were monitored with external reflectance (ER) and transmission FTIR spectroscopies, ellipsometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and static water contact angle goniometry. Hydrolysis and novel diamine conversion reactions were successfully performed on both neat PtBA homopolymer and end-grafted PtBA (Si-g-PtBA). Changes in static water contact angle confirmed the deposition of the N-aminopropyldimethylethoxysilane SAM and grafting of the end-functionalized PtBA. Reactions of the surface-grafted PtBA with ethylenediamine and dimethylethylenediamine showed the highest conversion yields.									10	0	0	3	0	10			0024-9297			WOS:000247678300017

Particular attention is paid to the preparation of the target surfaces for varying impact projectile fluence, energy and species, to the vibrational state of D-2 projectiles, as well as to the variation in sputtering yields with target surface and impact projectile. The methane and acetylene sputtering yields per deuteron, obtained with atomic and molecular projectiles, agree quantitatively with recent experimental values. We study the distribution of sputtered species, as well as their kinetic energy and angular spectra.									32	0	0	0	0	32			1367-2630			WOS:000247953000002

Osteogenic responses in fibroblasts activated by elastin degradation products and transforming growth factor-beta 1 - Role of myofibroblasts in vascular calcification								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY				171	1			116	123		10.2353/ajpath.2007060930			JUL 2007	2007	Our objective was to establish the role of fibroblasts in medial vascular calcification, a pathological process known to be associated with elastin degradation and remodeling. Rat dermal fibroblasts were treated in vitro with elastin degradation products and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1,factors usually present in deteriorated matrix environments. Cellular changes were monitored at the gene and protein level by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunofluorescence, and von Kossa staining for calcium deposits. By 21 days, multicellular calcified nodules were formed in the presence of elastin degradation products and TGF-beta 1 separately and to a significantly greater extent when used together. Before mineralization, cells expressed alpha-smooth muscle actin and large amounts of collagen type I and matrix metalloproteinase-2, characteristic features of myofibroblasts, key elements in tissue remodeling and repair. Stimulated cells expressed increased levels of core-binding factor alpha 1, osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase, and osteoprotegerin, representative bone-regulating proteins. For most proteins analyzed, TGF-beta 1 synergistically amplified responses of fibroblasts to elastin degradation products. In conclusion, elastin degradation products and TGF-beta 1 promote myofibroblastic and osteogenic differentiation in fibroblasts. These results support the idea that elastin-related calcification involves dynamic remodeling events and suggest the possibility of a defective tissue repair process.									57	3	1	42	0	59			0002-9440			WOS:000247712700014	17591959

Economic patterns in US arboriculture								Arboriculture & Urban Forestry				33	4			292	299					JUL 2007	2007	Arboriculture is a distinct industry that provides unique services to provide for the health and care of trees. It is a developing industry and this development leads to questions on how the industry is organized and operates. We define the industry, identify its size and growth patterns, discuss its structure and organization, describe its operation in terms of pricing and competition, and analyze whether it is dominated by large or small firms. This analysis provides important information for regulation and other policies related to arboriculture. The four largest arboricultural firms account for only 4% of combined industry receipts and the industry comprises nearly 82,000 establishments, employs approximately 160,000 workers, and earns annual gross receipts of nearly $9 billion.									0	0	0	3	0	3			1935-5297			BCI:BCI200700532584

An image-space path planner is then proposed to generate a desired image trajectory based on this measurable image Jacobian-like matrix and an image-space navigation function (NF) (i.e., a special potential field function) while satisfying rigid body constraints. An adaptive, homography-based visual servo tracking controller is then developed to navigate the position and orientation of a camera held by the end-effector of a robot manipulator to a goal position and orientation along the desired image-space trajectory while ensuring the target points remain visible (i.e., the target points avoid self-occlusion and remain in the field-of-view (FOV)) under certain technical restrictions. Due to the inherent nonlinear nature of the problem and the lack of depth information from a monocular system. a Lyapunov-based analysis is used to analyze the path planner and the adaptive controller. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed approach. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									16	1	0	0	0	17			0005-1098	1873-2836		WOS:000247764400005		
J	Muth, Eric R.; Elkins, Amanda N.								High dose ondansetron for reducing motion sickness in highly susceptible subjects								AVIATION SPACE AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE				78	7			686	692					JUL 2007	2007	Background: Ondansetron is currently being explored as a treatment for motion sickness due to its proven prophylactic effect on post-operative nausea, the nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy, and its lack of side effects. This study sought to compare the effectiveness of placebo, dimenhydrinate, and ondansetron for preventing motion sickness in highly susceptible subjects. Methods: A total of 63 subjects with a history of frequent motion sickness and positive report of self-treatment of motion sickness with over-the-counter medications were divided into 3 groups of 20 (3 were disqualified). Depending on their group assignment, subjects were given placebo, dimenhydrinate, or ondansetron I h before being rotated at 20 rpm while making head movements. Symptoms of motion sickness and electrogastrogram (EGG) data were collected prior to and during rotation. Results: There were no differences between the groups in number of head movements tolerated, time rotating, or symptom questionnaire scores. All groups showed a marginally significant decrease in normal 3 cycle per minute activity [F (1,45) = 3.04, p = 0.088] and a significant increase in gastric tachyarrhythmia [F (1,45) 9.71, p = 0.003], a pattern typically associated with motion sickness development. Conclusion: Neither ondansetron or dimenhydrinate prevented motion sickness in groups of highly susceptible people. Continued development of new treatments is necessary.									13	2	0	9	0	15			0095-6562			WOS:000247776400007	17679566	
J	Boinapally, Kavitha; Jiang, Xiuping								Comparing antibiotic resistance in commensal and pathogenic bacteria isolated from wild-caught South Carolina shrimps vs. farm-raised imported shrimps								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY				53	7			919	924		10.1139/W07-019			JUL 2007	2007	The objective of this study was to assess and differentiate wild-caught South Carolina (SC) shrimps from imported shrimps on the basis of microbiological analysis. Seven wild-caught SC shrimp and 13 farrn-raised imported shrimp samples were analyzed. Total plate counts from wild-caught shrimp samples ranged from 4.3 to 7.0 log(10) CFU/g, whereas counts from imported shrimp samples ranged from 3.2 to 5.7 log(10) CFU/g. There was no difference (P > 0.05) between total bacterial Counts of wild-caught SC shrimp and farm-raised imported shrimp. However, the percentages of bacteria with reduced susceptibility towards ceftriaxone and tetracycline were higher (P < 0.05) for farm-raised shrimp than for wild-caught samples. Salmonella spp. detected only in one farm-raised sample was resistant to ampicillin, ceftriaxone, gentamicin, streptomycin, and trimethoprim. Vibrio vulnficus was detected in both wild-caught and farm-raised shrimp samples; however, only the isolate from farm-raised shrimp was resistant to nalidixic acid and trimethoprim. Escherichia coli detected in one wild-caught sample was resistant to ampicillin. Both Listeria spp. and Salmonella spp. were absent with wild-caught SC samples. Therefore, the presence of more ceftriaxone- and tetracycline-resistant bacteria and the observed antimicrobial resistance phenotypes of isolates from the imported shrimp may reflect the possible use of antibiotics in raising shrimp in those countries.									8	1	0	8	0	9			0008-4166			WOS:000249765000012	17898847	
J	An, Youn-Joo; Lee, Ji Hoon; Jeong, Seung-Woo								Partitioning of hydrogen peroxide between the gas and liquid phases in the presence of surfactant								CHEMOSPHERE				68	7			1377	1381		10.1016/j.chemosphere.2007.01.013			JUL 2007	2007	Gas-liquid phase partitioning is a key physical property that can predict the environmental fate of a compound between two phases. Several environmental factors have been known to affect the gas-liquid phase partitioning. We investigated the influence of surfactant on the gas-liquid phase partitioning of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The surfactant used was ammonium perfluorooctanoate (APFO). H2O2 solution containing the surfactant was equilibrated in a closed system and gas phase H2O2 concentration was measured by the peroxyoxalate chemiluminescence (PO-CL) method. Gas phase H2O2 concentrations remained constant below the critical micelle concentration (CMC) and increased linearly with surfactant concentration above the CMC, which indicated that surfactant micelles influenced the gas-liquid phase partitioning of H2O2. This result showed that H2O2-micelle interactions are less favorable than H2O2-H2O interactions. Surfactant monomers did not affect the gas-liquid phase partitioning of H2O2 due to the absence of micelles. Solvent (methanol) effect was also investigated and showed that gas phase H2O2 Concentrations increased with the addition of solvent. This indicated the unfavorable interaction of H2O2 with hydrophobic medium compared to hydrophilic one. lt is consistent with the result that H2O2-micelles has a weaker interaction than H2O2-water because surfactant micelles are hydrocarbon-like organic phase rather than aqueous phase.

Of 20 compounds analyzed for, only p,p'-DDE was quantified in reportable concentrations, ranging from <2.0-174.0 ng/g wet weight (ww). Concentrations of p,p'-DDE were significantly greater (P < 0.0001) in plasma of nestlings from an inland colony, Chew Mill ((-)x 16.9 ng/g, ww) than a coastal colony, Harris Neck ((-)x 1.2 ng/g, ww). Concentrations from nestlings from Chew Mill were significantly different among sampling weeks (P = 0.01), with week 8 being significantly greater than weeks 1, 2, and 5. While the Chew Mill colony had much greater concentrations of p,p'-DDE in plasma of nestlings than the Harris Neck colony, reproduction was greater there (1.8 +/- 1.0 SD fledged young per nesting attempt) than Harris Neck (1.4 +/- 1.0 SD fledged young per nesting attempt). While concentrations of p,p'-DDE determined in plasma of nestling Wood Storks are an indirect measure of adult exposure to environmental toxicants, concentrations reported would not be considered detrimental to reproduction in these colonies.

The project's goals were to a) reduce repeat pregnancies; b) increase school retention and graduation; c) reduce substance use; and d) improve well-being. Data were collected at baseline and 6-month intervals over the course of the intervention and were analyzed through mixed effects analysis of variance. The results showed that, compared to the control group, treatment group teens had fewer pregnancies; performed better academically and graduated at higher rates; reduced their marijuana use; were less impulsive; improved their problem solving beliefs; and had more social support, especially from family members. These findings hold promise for designing and implementing community interventions to support pregnant and parenting teens, particularly in rural communities. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Except for rice yield in 2002, whiteheads per square meter and rice yield were significantly affected by insecticide treatments in each year of the study. Biorational insecticides (diflubenzuron, novaluron and tebufenozide) did not significantly (P > 0.05) reduce injury and yield in 2002. Applications of diflubenzuron and novaluron at 14 days after flood were not as effective in reducing injury as lambda-cyhalothrin. In 2005, applications of methoxyfenozide at the 2.5-5 cm particle stage significantly (P< 0.05) reduced injury, but differences in yield were not detected. The greatest reduction in whiteheads (14-fold) was achieved with two applications of lambda-cyhalothrin (at the 5 cm particle and heading stages) with and without the seed treatment fipronil in 2002. Economic analyses showed outcomes ranging from a net loss of -$594/ha for lambda-cyhalothrin applied at before flood in 2005 to a net benefit of $172/ha for lambda-cyhalothrin applied twice at the 5 cm particle and late boot/heading stages in 2004. Foliar applications generally resulted in net increased benefit for all treatments. Combined with other management tactics such as the use of resistant cultivars, judicial use of insecticides can help farmers manage stem borers in rice in Texas. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Three-dimensional polymeric systems for cancer cell studies								CYTOTECHNOLOGY				54	3			135	143		10.1007/s10616-007-9065-4			JUL 2007	2007	Three-dimensional (3-D) culture of cancer cells and of normal mammalian cells in a polymeric matrix is generally a better alternate model for understanding the regulation of cancer cell proliferation and for evaluation of different anticancer drugs. A substantial amount of evidence demonstrates important differences in the behavior of cells grown in monolayer, i.e., two-dimensional (2-D), and in 3-D cultures. Cancer cells grown in 3-D culture are more resistant to cytotoxic agents than cells in 2-D culture; growth of cells in vitro in 3-D requires a suitable polymer that provides a structural scaffold for cell adhesion and growth. Many naturally derived polymers as well as synthetic polymers have been investigated as scaffolds. The aim of this review is to overview the polymeric materials of natural and synthetic origin that are of specific interest to 3-D cell cultures, and discuss the development of new polymers that should be specifically designed for 3-D culture applications.									33	3	0	24	0	36			0920-9069			WOS:000249069000001	19003005	
J	Oh, Chi-Ok; Ditton, Robert B.; Riechers, Robin								Understanding anglers' preferences for fishing tournament characteristics and policies								ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT				40	1			123	133		10.1007/s00267-006-0010-7			JUL 2007	2007	Saltwater fishing tournaments in the United States are generally not regulated nor are there different fishing regulations for tournament and nontournament anglers. Although much is known about those who participate in fishing tournaments in terms of their fishing motivations, attitudes, and characteristics, much less is known at the angler population level regarding their preferences for tournament opportunities. Using a stated preference choice model with hypothetical scenarios to simulate participation choices and understand preferences, study objectives were to identify angler preferences for various types of tournament fishing "products." Four tournament policy characteristics were investigated: promotion of catch and release, bait restrictions, whether a percentage of the tournament entrance fee should go to support fishery management activities, and whether a tournament should be a nonprofit or profit-making venture. Three expectation attributes were inserted: tournament size, trip cost per day, and whether a tournament is family friendly. We sent seven different versions of the mail questionnaire to 1,633 anglers. Of 795 returns, 648 were used for estimating conditional logit models. Analysis indicated that a scenario with no management interventions was not most preferred. Anglers most preferred a conservation-oriented option that introduced additional management measures. Overall, scenarios with management interventions were more favored than the status quo situation (with no management interventions). Although respondents showed reluctance to adopt other management-related options, results generally indicated they were increasingly concerned with sustainability of fish stocks and potential conflicts between tournament and nontournament users and preferred tournament products that reflect these concerns.									6	0	0	5	0	6			0364-152X	1432-1009		WOS:000247338100012	17546522

Spectroscopic evidence for uranium bearing precipitates in vadose zone sediments at the Hanford 300-area site								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				41	13			4633	4639		10.1021/es062196u			JUL 1 2007	2007	Uranium (U) solid-state speciation in vadose zone sediments collected beneath the former North Process Pond (NPP) in the 300 Aroa of the Hanford site (Washington) was investigated using multi-scale techniques. In 30 day batch experiments, only a small fraction of total U (similar to 7.4%) was released to artificial groundwater solutions equilibrated with 1% PCO2- Synchrotron-based micro-X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy analyses showed that U was distributed among at least two types of species: (i) U discrete grains associated with Cu and (ii) areas with intermediate U concentrations on grains and grain coatings. Metatorbernite (CU[UO2](2)[PO4](2 center dot)8H(2)O) and uranophane (Ca[UO2](2)[SiO3(OH)](2 center dot) 5H(2)O) at some U discrete grains, and muscovite at U intermediate concentration areas, were identified in synchrotron-based micro-X-ray diffraction. Scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray analyses revealed 8-10 mu m size metatorbemite particles that were embedded in C-, Al-, and Si-rich coatings on quartz and albite grains. In mu- and bulk-X-ray absorption structure (mu-XAS and XAS) spectroscopy analyses, the structure of metatorbernite with addi-ional U-C and U-U coordination environments was consistently observed at U discrete grains with high U concentrations. The consistency of the mu- and bulk-XAS analyses suggests that metatorbernite may comprise a significant fraction of the total U in the sample.

Since most patients have a disease that is not amenable to surgical resection, tumor ablation modalities are increasingly being used for treatment of liver cancer. This review describes the current status of ablative technologies used as alternatives for resection, clinical experience with these technologies, currently available devices and design rules for the development of new devices and the improvement of existing ones. It focuses on probe design for radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation and cryoablation, and compares the advantages and disadvantages of each ablation modality.									27	0	0	6	1	30			1743-4440			WOS:000248089200022	17605688	
J	Ofiteru, Augustin; Bucurenci, Nadia; Alexov, Emil; Bertrand, Thomas; Briozzo, Pierre; Munier-Lehmann, Helene; Gilles, Anne-Marie								Structural and functional consequences of single amino acid substitutions in the pyrimidine base binding pocket of Escherichia coli CMP kinase								FEBS JOURNAL				274	13			3363	3373		10.1111/j.1742-4658.2007.05870.x			JUL 2007	2007	Bacterial CMP kinases are specific for CMP and dCMP, whereas the related eukaryotic NMP kinase phosphorylates CMP and UMP with similar efficiency. To explain these differences in structural terms, we investigated the contribution of four key amino acids interacting with the pyrimidine ring of CMP (Ser36, Asp132, Arg110 and Arg188) to the stability, catalysis and substrate specificity of Escherichia coli CMP kinase. In contrast to eukaryotic UMP/CMP kinases, which interact with the nucleobase via one or two water molecules, bacterial CMP kinase has a narrower NMP-binding pocket and a hydrogen-bonding network involving the pyrimidine moiety specific for the cytosine nucleobase. The side chains of Arg110 and Ser36 cannot establish hydrogen bonds with UMP, and their substitution by hydrophobic amino acids simultaneously affects the K-m of CMP/dCMP and the k(cat) value. Substitution of Ser for Asp132 results in a moderate decrease in stability without significant changes in K-m value for CMP and dCMP. Replacement of Arg188 with Met does not affect enzyme stability but dramatically decreases the k(cat)/K-m ratio compared with wild-type enzyme. This effect might be explained by opening of the enzyme/nucleotide complex, so that the sugar no longer interacts with Asp185. The reaction rate for different modified CMP kinases with ATP as a variable substrate indicated that none of changes induced by these amino acid substitutions was 'propagated' to the ATP subsite. This 'modular' behavior of E. coli CMP kinase is unique in comparison with other NMP kinases.									12	0	0	9	0	12			1742-464X	1742-4658		WOS:000247661800015	17542990

We present theoretical arguments for the behaviour of the filling time relative to the idealised 'filling box time' [Baines WD, Turner JS. Turbulent buoyant convection from a source in a confined region. J Fluid Mech 1969;37:51-80] as a function of the room height to width aspect ratio. Initially, the rate at which the smoke layer deepens is shown to be more rapid for relatively wide rooms (large aspect ratio). However, at larger times, relatively tall rooms (small aspect ratio) fill more rapidly due to large scale overturning and engulfing of ambient fluid. A series of experiments were performed to verify these results and showed good qualitative agreement with our theoretical predictions. The experiments were also used to evaluate the extent of deviation of the actual smoke front position from the idealised filling box model as a function of the aspect ratio. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Brown, Bryan L.				Brown, Bryan/D-9726-2014				Habitat heterogeneity and disturbance influence patterns of community temporal variability in a small temperate stream								HYDROBIOLOGIA				586				93	106		10.1007/s10750-006-0531-3			JUL 2007	2007	Both habitat heterogeneity and disturbance can profoundly influence ecological systems at many levels of biological and ecological organization. However, the joint influences of heterogeneity and disturbance on temporal variability in communities have received little attention despite the intense homogenizing influence of human activity. I performed a field manipulation of substrate heterogeneity in a small New England stream, and measured changes in benthic macroinvertebrate communities for 100 days-a period that included both a severe drought and a flood. Generally, community variability decreased with increasing substrate heterogeneity. However, within sampling intervals, this relationship tended to fluctuate through time, apparently tracking changes in hydrology. At the beginning of the experiment, community temporal variability clearly decreased along a gradient of increasing substrate heterogeneity-a result consistent with an observational study performed the previous year. During the subsequent weeks, droughts and flooding created exceptionally high variability in both hydrology and benthic macroinvertebrate community structure resulting in the disappearance of this relationship. However, during the last weeks of the experiment when hydrologic conditions were relatively more stable, the negatively sloped relationship between community temporal variability and habitat heterogeneity reemerged and mimicked relationships observed both early in the experiment and in the previous year's study. High habitat heterogeneity may promote temporal stability through several mechanisms including stabilization of resources and increased refugia from minor disturbances or predation. However, the results of this experiment suggest that severe disturbance events can create large-scale environmental variability that effectively swamps the influence of habitat heterogeneity, illustrating that a thorough understanding of community temporal variability in natural systems will necessarily consider sources of environmental variability at multiple spatial and temporal scales.									24	0	0	23	3	26			0018-8158			WOS:000246612800008

These models explain phenomena like phase changes, clustering, and scaling. It is necessary to understand these phenomena when designing systems where exact node configurations cannot be known in advance. This paper presents a method for analyzing random graph models that combine discrete mathematics and probability theory. A graph connectivity matrix is constructed where each matrix element is the Bernoulli probability that an edge exists between two given nodes: We show how to construct these matrices for many graph classes, and use linear algebra to analyze the connectivity matrix. We present an application that uses this approach to analyze network cluster self-organization for sensor network security. We conclude by discussing the use of these concepts in mobile systems design.									10	2	0	0	0	12			1094-6977			WOS:000247644800025

Evaluation of alternate multimedia for web-based asynchronous learning								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ERGONOMICS				37	7			615	629		10.1016/j.ergon.2007.04.004			JUL 2007	2007	Choosing the appropriate multimedia for the learning modules or systems is critical to designing an efficient web-based asynchronous learning systems or modules. In response to this need, a study was conducted to gauge the effectiveness of different multimedia combinations, namely: text; audio and synchronized text; audio, video and synchronized text, for procedural-based tasks to support web-based learning for a senior-level Production, Planning and Control Course. Data were collected on performance, process and subjective measures. Analyses of these learning systems throw new light on the effectiveness of the different multimedia combinations to improve web-based learning of procedural tasks. The most salient finding of the study is that user performance is dependent on the type of multimedia combination and the type of learning task in terms of complexity. Interestingly, for low difficulty procedural tasks, the choice of multimedia is not critical for either performance or process efficiency. However, when the procedural tasks are complex, a combination of audio, video and synchronized text yields the best results both in terms of learning performance and process efficiency measured in terms of amount of time spent viewing the modules and the module accessing frequency. Another important finding is that an easy-to-use system does not imply an efficient learning system. The study helps recommend design guidelines for the most appropriate type of multimedia to be used in designing web-based asynchronous learning systems for different levels of procedural tasks.Relevance to industryThis paper evaluates the usefulness of various multimedia for web-based asynchronous learning for a specific Industrial Engineering course. The results of this research could be further expanded to develop distance-learning programs for both educational and industry training programs. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The majority of studies so far have been focusing on the expansion of tumor infiltrated lymphocytes (TIL) and some have shown very encouraging results. Recently, we have developed a unique tumor immune response activator, dendritomas, by fusion of dendritic cells and tumor cells. Animal studies and early clinical trials have shown that dendritomas are able to activate tumor specific immune responses. In this study, we hypothesized that naive T cells can be primed with dendritomas and expanded in vitro to develop an adoptive transfer therapy for patients who do not have solid tumors, such as leukemia. T cells were isolated and purified from lymph nodes of mice. The cells were then incubated with dendritomas made from syngeneic DCs and tumor cells and expanded in vitro using Dynabeads mouse CD3/CD28 T cell expander for approximately three weeks. The in vitro primed and expanded T cells showed tumor cell specific CTL activity and increased secretion of IFN-gamma. Tumor bearing mice receiving the in vitro expanded T cells survived significantly longer than control mice. Furthermore, the depletion of regulator T cells enhanced the survival of the mice that received the adoptive transfer therapy.									4	0	0	2	0	4			1019-6439			WOS:000247503900023	17549421

(33 degrees 22'02 '' N, 81 degrees 12'14 '' W). Five treatments were evaluated to determine the effects of insecticides on incidence of N. fresenii: acetamiprid, dicrotophos, thiamethoxam, imidacloprid, and control. Aphids were sampled by taking 24 leaves from 12 cotton plants from each plot and placed into 30-ml screw cap vials filled with 70% ethanol. Fungus infection in aphids, numbers of aphids, percentage of winged aphids, and fungus infection in winged aphids were determined from aphids for each plot.The highest fungus infection occurred on July 12 and 16. Acetamiprid treated plots had infection levels of N. fresenii lower than other treatments. Cotton aphid numbers in acetamiprid and thiamethoxam plots were significantly lower than in the dicrotophos treatment and untreated plots. None of the treatments caused reductions in percentage of winged aphids or in infection levels by N. fresenii in winged aphids.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1523-5475			WOS:000207494900001

Corn oil was supplemented (g/kg of BW) at 0 (none), 0.75 (medium), and 1.5 (high). Cottonseed hulls were used as a carrier for the corn oil and were supplemented according to pasture availability (0.7 to 1% of BW). Steers were finished on a rotationally grazed, tall fescue pasture for 116 d. Fatty acid composition of LM, s.c. adipose, and diet was determined by GLC. Total linoleic acid intake increased linearly (P < 0.01) with corn oil supplementation (90.7, 265.1, and 406.7 g in none, medium, and high, respectively). Oil supplementation linearly reduced (P < 0.05) myristic, palmitic, and linolenic acid percentage in LM and s.c. adipose. Vaccenic acid (C18:1 t11; VA) percentage was 46 and 32% greater (linear, P = 0.02; quadratic, P = 0.01) for medium and high, respectively, than none, regardless of tissue. Effect of oil supplementation on CLA cis-9, trans- 11 was affected by type of adipose tissue (P < 0.01). In the LM, CLA cis-9, trans-11 isomer was 25% greater for medium than for none and intermediate for high, whereas CLA cis-9, trans-11 CLA isomer was 48 and 33% greater in s.c. adipose tissue for medium and high than for none, respectively. Corn oil linearly increased (P <= 0.01) trans-10 octadecenoic acid and CLA trans-10, cis-12; however, values were low (<0.35 and <0.035% of total fatty acids, respectively). Oil supplementation did not change (P > 0.05) the percentage of total SFA, MUFA, or PUFA but linearly increased (P = 0.03) n-6:n-3 ratio from 2.4 to 2.9 in none and high, respectively. Among tissues, total SFA and MUFA were greater in s.c. adipose than LM, whereas total PUFA, n-6, and n-3 fatty acids and the n-6:n-3 ratio were lower. Trans-10 octadecenoic acid, VA, and CLA trans-10, cis-12 were greater (P < 0.01) in s.c. adipose than in LM. Oil supplementation did not alter (P > 0.05) stearoyl CoA desaturase activity or mRNA expression. Corn oil supplementation to grazing steers reduced the percentages of highly atherogenic fatty acids (myristic and palmitic acids) and increased the percentages of antiatherogenic and anticarcinogenic fatty acids (VA and cis-9, trans-11 CLA).									18	0	0	16	1	18			0021-8812			WOS:000247530300015	17431049

Synthesis and thermoelectric properties of "nano-engineered" CoSb3 skutterudite materials								JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS				36	7			711	715		10.1007/s11664-007-0160-2			JUL 2007	2007	Because of their good electrical transport properties, skutterudites have been widely studied as potential next-generation thermoelectric (TE) materials. One of the main obstacles to further improving their thermoelectric performance has been reducing their relatively high thermal conductivity. To some extent, this hindrance has been partially resolved by filling the voids found in the skutterudite structure with so-called "rattling" atoms. It has been predicted that reducing the dimensionality in a TE material would have a positive effect in enhancing its thermoelectric properties, for example increasing the thermopower and reducing the thermal conductivity. Introducing nanoparticles into the skutterudite materials could therefore have favorable effects on their electrical properties and should also reduce lattice thermal conductivity by introducing extra scattering centers throughout the sample. Nanoparticles may also be used in conjunction with void filling for further reduction of the thermal conductivity of skutterudites. Cobalt triantimonide (CoSb3) samples with different amounts of embedded nanoparticles have been grown, and the electrical and thermal transport properties for these composites have been measured from 10 K to 650 K. The synthetic techniques and electrical and thermal transport data are discussed in this paper.									19	0	0	0	0	19			0361-5235			WOS:000248573400003

X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning-electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) were used to analyze the powder products. Results showed that the as-prepared Bi2Te3 samples were all single-phased and consisted of irregular spherical granules with diameters of similar to 30 nm whereas the PbTe samples were mainly composed of well-crystallized cubic crystals with average size of approximately 100 nm. Some nanotubes and nanorods were found in Bi2Te3 and PbTe samples, respectively; these were identified as Bi2Te3 nanotubes and PbTe nanorods by EDS analysis. Possible reaction mechanisms for these syntheses are discussed in detail herein.									36	4	1	0	0	41			0361-5235			WOS:000248573400005

Joseph								Thermoelectric properties of half-Heusler bismuthides ZrCo1-xNixBi (x=0.0 to 0.1)								JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC MATERIALS				36	7			732	735		10.1007/s11664-007-0153-1			JUL 2007	2007	The usefulness of half-Heusler (HH) alloys as thermoelectrics has been mainly limited by their relatively large thermal conductivity, which is a key issue despite their high thermoelectric power factors. In this regard, Bi-containing half-Heusler alloys are particularly appealing, because they are, potentially, of low thermal conductivity. One such a material is ZrCoBi. We prepared pure and Ni-doped ZrCoBi by a solid-state reaction. To evaluate thermoelectric potential we measured electrical resistivity (p = 1/sigma) and thermopower (sigma) up to 1000 K and thermal conductivity (k) Up to 300 K. Our measurements indicate that for these alloys resistivity of approximately a few m Omega cm and thermopower larger than a hundred mu V K-1 are possible. Low k values are also possible. On the basis of these data we conclude that this system has a potential to be optimized further, despite the low power factors (alpha(2) sigma T) we have currently measured.									6	0	0	1	0	6			0361-5235			WOS:000248573400007

Several parameters of the growth conditions, including hot-zone temperature and starting stoichiometry, were varied in order to control the formation of ReO2 inclusions, as confirmed by the electron microscopy, resistivity, and magnetic susceptibility measurements. The Rietveld refinement of x-ray (neutron) powder diffraction was found to be consistent with a cubic structure Fd3m with lattice constant a = 10.2250 (10.2358) angstrom, and reduced coordinate of O1 = 0.3184 (0.3177) at 293 K (250 K). We also studied the oxygen stoichiometry by means of redox reactions, electron microprobe analysis (EMPA), and x-ray/neutron diffractions. Particularly, the neutron powder diffraction on the Cd-114-enriched specimens yielded an oxygen deficiency delta = 0.14 +/- 0.03 solely at the O2 site, which was consistent with the EMPA results. The EMPA indicated that the oxygen deficiency is homogeneous in the bulk and in a range of 0.01 +/- 0.18-0.23 +/- 0.19.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0361-5235			WOS:000248573400009

A dipeptide Gly(L)Phe containing a trifluoroethylated peptide bond was synthesized by removing the alpha-amino proton of N-alpha-trifluoroethyl (L)phenylalanine methyl ester followed by coupling with N-alpha-phthaloyl glycine acid fluoride. The dipeptide was further coupled with (L)leucine methyl ester under conventional carboxyl activation conditions to provide two diastereomers of the tripeptide Gly(D,L)Phe(L)Leu. The solution dynamic behavior of the tripeptide was investigated as a function of solvents, by NOESY and variable temperature (VT) F-19 NMR experiments. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Effects of inorganic selenium compounds on oxidative DNA damage								JOURNAL OF INORGANIC BIOCHEMISTRY				101	7			1028	1035		10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2007.03.016			JUL 2007	2007	Exposure of Escherichia coli or mammalian cells to H2O2 results in cell death due to iron-mediated DNA damage. Since selenium compounds have been examined for their ability to act as antioxidants to neutralize radical species, and inorganic selenium compounds are used to supplement protein mixes, infant formula, and animal feed, determining the effect of these compounds on DNA damage under conditions of oxidative stress is crucial. In the presence of Fe(II) and H2O2, the effects of Na2SeO4, Na2SeO3, SeO2 (0.5-5000 mu m), and Na2Se (0.5-200 mu M) on DNA damage were quantified using gel electrophoresis. Both Na2SeO4 and Na2Se have no effect on DNA damage, whereas SeO2 inhibits DNA damage and Na2SeO3 shows antioxidant or pro-oxidant activity depending on H2O2 concentration. Similar electrophoresis experiments with[Fe(EDTA)](2-) (400 mu M) and Na2SeO3 or SeO2 show that metal coordination by the selenium compound is required for antioxidant activity. In light of these results, Na2SeO4 may be safer than NaSeO3 for nutritional supplements. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The most common type of resistance has been called "Mode 1" and is characterized by recessive inheritance, > 500-fold resistance to and reduced binding by at least one Cry1A toxin, and negligible cross-resistance to Cry1C. In three lepidopteran species, Heliothis virescens, Pectinophora gossypiella, and Helicoverpa armigera, Mode I resistance is caused by mutations in a toxin-binding 12-cadberin-domain protein expressed in the larval midgut. These mutations all interrupt the primary sequence of the protein and prevent its normal localization in the membrane, presumably removing a major toxic binding target of the Cry1A toxins. in Plutella xylostella, however, Mode I resistance appears to be caused by a different genetic mechanism, as Cry I A resistance is unlinked to the cadherin gene. Mapping studies in H. virescens have detected an additional major Cry1A resistance gene, which on the basis of comparative linkage mapping is distinct from the one in P. xylostella. An additional resistance mechanism supported by genetic data involves a protoxin-processing protease in Plodia interpunctella, and this is likely to be different from the genes mapped in Plutella and Heliothis. Thus, resistance to Cry1A toxins in species of Lepidoptera has a complex genetic basis, with at least four distinct, major resistance genes of which three are mapped in one or more species. The connection between resistance genes and the mechanisms they encode remains a challenging task to elucidate.

Ballistic-performance optimization of a hybrid carbon-nanotube/E-glass reinforced poly-vinyl-ester-epoxy-matrix composite armor								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE				42	14			5347	5359		10.1007/s10853-006-0959-x			JUL 2007	2007	The material model for a multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) reinforced poly-vinyl-ester-epoxy matrix composite material (carbon nanotube reinforced composite mats, in the following) developed in our recent work (M. Grujicic et al. submitted), has been used in the present work within a transient non-linear dynamics analysis to carry out design optimization of a hybrid polymer-matrix composite armor for the ballistic performance with respect to the impact by a fragment simulating projectile (FSP). The armor is constructed from E-glass continuous-fiber poly-vinyl-ester-epoxy matrix composite laminas interlaced with the carbon nanotube reinforced composite mats. Different designs of the hybrid armor are obtained by varying the location and the thickness of the carbon nanotube reinforced composite mats. The results obtained indicate that at a fixed thickness of the armor, both the position and the thickness of the carbon nanotube reinforced composite mats affect the ballistic performance of the armor. Specifically, it is found that the best performance of the armor is obtained when thicker carbon nanotube reinforced composite mats are placed near the front armor face, the face which is struck by the projectile. The results obtained are rationalized using an analysis of the elastic wave reflection and transmission behavior at the lamina/met and laminate/air interfaces.									20	0	0	0	0	20			0022-2461			WOS:000247943600008

Among various strategies to address the solubility issue, the reduction of drug particle sizes to the nanoscale has been identified as a potentially effective and broadly applicable approach. Complementary to traditional methods, supercritical fluid techniques have found unique applications in the production and processing of drug particles. Here we report the application of a newly developed supercritical fluid processing technique, Rapid Expansion of a Supercritical Solution into a Liquid Solvent, to the nanosizing of potent antiparasitic drug Amphotericin B particles. A supercritical carbon dioxide-cosolvent system was used for the solubilization and processing of the drug. The process produced well-dispersed nanoscale Amphotericin B particles suspended in an aqueous solution, and the suspension was intrinsically stable or could be further stabilized in the presence of water-soluble polymers. The properties of the drug nanoparticles were found to be dependent on the type of cosolvent used. The results on the use of dimethyl sulfoxide and methanol as cosolvents and their effects on the properties of nanosized Amphotericin B particles are presented and discussed.									6	0	1	6	0	8			1533-4880			WOS:000246347700049	17663280

The laser emission was found to be dependent upon the incident angle of the excitation and exhibited linewidths of approximately 1.2 angstrom, quality factors (Q) exceeding 5000, and thresholds below 0.3 mu J pulse. Such elliptical organic micro-ring lasers offer increased tailorability in emission properties over more conventional analogues of circular cross-section. Also discussed is the potential for such low-threshold lasers to serve as integrated sources for fibre lasers and amplifiers.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1464-4258			WOS:000247925600001

Determination of the diffusivity of a hydrophilic migratory additive in iPP films								JOURNAL OF PLASTIC FILM & SHEETING				23	3			187	201		10.1177/8756087907084730			JUL 2007	2007	This article describes the measurement of the diffusivity of a commercial hydrophilic additive (CHA), Irgasurf HL560, at concentrations of 5 and 10 wt% in polypropylene films at different temperatures. The model used was a standard 1-D diffusion model, in which the film weight was expressed as a function of time as the additive concentration at the film surface was kept at zero at all times. Experimentally, two cases were compared: (1) Washing additive off the film surface with limited contact with the solvent, while PP films were stored in air and tested at 25, 40, 55, and 70 degrees C up to 20 days. (2) Immersing the film in solvent with continuous stirring at 25 degrees C for 10 days, 44 degrees C for 2 days, and 65 degrees C for 10 h. Diffusivity measured by the surface-washing method was 10(-14) to 10(-12) cm(2)/s, and 10(-12) to 10(-10) by the immersion method. TGA results showed no effect of solvent enhancement to additive diffusion at 25 degrees C but slightly enhanced at 44 and 65 degrees C. Results for both the surface-washing and immersion methods are shown for instructive purposes. It is clear that the diffusivity calculated from surface-washing is much lower than from continuous immersion, largely because the boundary condition of zero additive concentration of the film surfaces was invalid between washings as additive bloomed to the surfaces and accumulated there. The continuous immersion method more closely matched the zero boundary condition used in the model and thus gave more accurate diffusivity values than did the surface-washing method.									1	1	0	0	0	1			8756-0879			WOS:000251941100001

The spectra of noninteracting silver particles, i.e. colloidal suspension consist of two characteristic bands: dipole at 545 nm and quadrupole at 430 nm components of the surface plasmon resonance. Presence of some fraction of silver whiskers in colloids causes broadening and tailing of the dipole component. Coating of Ag particles with Si mantle shifts plasmon resonances to the longer wavelengths. The extinction spectrum of planar array of Ag sub-micron particles self-assembled on a glass substrate drastically differs from that for colloidal suspension. The effect may arise from coherent coupling of surface plasmons associated with the particles. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Real estate agents are found to receive a premium when selling their own houses in comparison to similar client-owned houses. Given the homogeneity of the condominium market in comparison to the single-family house market, we use a large sample of condominium transactions to examine if agency problems exist in the condominium market. Controlling for sample selection and endogeneity bias of the data, we find evidence for a similar price premium for agent-owned condominiums. In contrast to the results for single-family houses in the same geographic market, we find that agent-owned condominiums must stay on the market longer to receive a higher price.									13	0	0	0	0	13			0895-5638	1573-045X		WOS:000246739500003

Two-stage channel systems consist of an inset channel and small floodplain (benches) within the ditch confines. The two-stage channel sizing procedure includes nine steps: (1) project identifications (2) data collection; (3) data analysis; (4) hydrologic evaltiation: (5) conceptual channel system sizing; (6) project assessment; (7) design and/or final sizing: (8) construction; and (9) monitoring and assessment of performance. Channel width and depth dimensions are determined based on a weight-of-evidence approach that considers geomorphology measurements at the project site and throughout the watershed. The authors inhave developed spreadsheet tools to aid in evaluating the geornorphology of one and twosta stage channels. Constructing a two-stage channel requires more excavation than traditional ditch maintenance, but benefits include improved conveyance capacity, a channel geometry that will be more self-sustaining. and improvement to in-stream habitat.

The development of depositional bars, or benches, in these agricultural channel systems has been a focus of maintenance activities. Objectives of the reported study were to: (1) determine if there was a relationship between inset channel geometry, as defined by its benches, and geometry predicted by regional curves that relate bankfull geometry to drainage area; (2) evaluate the effect of channel geometry on bed material particle size distribution; and (3) determine if the particle size distribution of bench materials was related to depth from the surface and position on the bench. The study was conducted on low gradient ditches that are headwaters of the Mississippi River and Lake Erie. An analysis to determine the extent of bench and inset channel formation was undertaken using 0.15 m (0.5 ft) resolution panchromatic digital orthophotos. Geomorphology measurements were made at 13 sites, and a 61 cm (24 m) long split-spoon sampler, with a 7.6 cm (3 m) inner diameter, was used to extract cores from the benches at each site. About 59% of the assessed channels showed inset channel development and bench formation. For 12 of the 13 sites, the bankfull dimensions of the inset channel were consistent with regional curves. All benches showed fining of materials with distance away from the inset channel. It was concluded that benches evolve much like floodplains that build because of overbank accretion. The results will be helpful in determining alternative strategies for improving the drainage function of these systems while enhancing ecological habitat and water quality.

Investigation of the link between avian vacuolar myelinopathy and a novel species of cyanobacteria through laboratory feeding trials								JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES				43	3			337	344					JUL 2007	2007	Avian vacuolar myelinopathy (AVM) is a neurologic disease affecting Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), American Coots (Fulica americana), and other birds in the southeastern United States. The cause of the disease has not yet been determined, although it is generally thought to be a natural toxin. Previous studies have linked AVM to aquatic vegetation, and the current working hypothesis is that a species of cyanobacteria growing epiphytically on that vegetation is producing a toxin that causes AVM. Surveys of epiphytic communities have identified a novel species of cyanobacteria in the order Stigonematales as the most likely suspect. The purpose of this study was to further examine the relationship between the suspect Stigonematales species and induction of AVM, by using animal feeding trials. Adult Mallards and domestic chickens were fed aquatic vegetation from two study sites containing the suspect cyanobacterial epiphyte, as well as a control site that did not contain the Stigonematales species. Two trials were conducted. The first trial used vegetation collected during mid-October 2003, and the second trial used vegetation collected during November and December 2003. Neither treatment nor control birds in the first trial developed AVM lesions. Ten of 12 treatment Mallards in the second trial were diagnosed with AVM, and control birds were not affected. This study provides further evidence that the novel Stigonematales species may be involved with AVM induction, or at the least it is a good predictor of AVM toxin presence in a system. The results also demonstrate the seasonal nature of AVM events.									11	0	0	9	0	11			0090-3558	1943-3700		WOS:000248921100002	17699072

The saw-toothed chips formed in hard machining have their own unique characteristics. The saw-toothed chip morphology is of great interest since the understanding of the saw-toothed chip morphology and its evolution in machining helps unveil hard machining chip formation mechanisms as well as facilitate hard machining implementation into industry. In this study, the effect of tool wear and cutting conditions on the saw-toothed chip morphology was examined in machining 52100 hardened 52100 bearing steel. It was found that the chip dimensional values and segmentation frequency were affected by tool wear and cutting conditions while the chip segmentation angles were approximately constant under different tool wear and cutting conditions. The shear band spacing has also been predicted at the same order of magnitude as the measurement, and improved, spacing modeling accuracy is expected if the cutting process information can be better predicted first.									10	0	0	0	0	10			1091-0344			WOS:000249763000003

Due to low detector sensitivity, Up until now, only a handful of sources have been detected in that electromagnetic window. Cobalt lines from SN1987A and Ti-44 lines from the Cassiopeia A (Cas A) supernova remnant offer unique constraints on the properties of the innermost regions of core collapse supernovae. Diffuse gamma-ray lilies from the decay of radioactive Al-26 and the annihilation of positrons are bright enough for mapping the Milky Way in the MeV regime, and are both measured by recent spaceborne spectrometers with unprecedented precision. This constrains the sources of Al production and the state of interstellar gas in the vicinity of these sites: the total mass of Al-26 produced by stellar sources throughout the Galaxy is estimated to be similar to 3 M-circle dot per Myr, and the interstellar medium near those sources appears to be characterized by velocities of similar to 100 km s(-1). Positron annihilation must occur in a modestly ionized, warm phase of the interstellar medium, but at present the major positron production site(s) remain unknown. The spatial distribution of the annihilation gamma-ray emission constrains positron production sites and positron propagation in the Galaxy. Fe-60 radioactivity has been clearly detected recently; the flux ratio relative to 26 Al of about 15% is on the lower side of predictions from massive star and supernova, nucleosynthesis models. Those views at nuclear and astrophysical processes in and around cosmic sources by space-based gamma-ray telescopes offer invaluable information on cosmic nucleosynthesis.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1086-9379	1945-5100		WOS:000250472200008

All fish survived for 24 h at a salinity of 2 parts per thousand, but 73% died within 24 h of a reduction to 1 parts per thousand salinity. Plasma osmolality decreased significantly with decreasing salinity. Fish held for 7 d at 2, 5, or 8 parts per thousand after an approximately 1 parts per thousand daily reduction differed significantly in plasma osmolality; fish held at a salinity of 2 parts per thousand exhibited significantly lower plasma osmolality than fish in the other treatments. Doubling the environmental Ca concentration did not affect plasma osmolality. The results indicate that cobias have limited euryhaline abilities but not enough to sustain low-salinity culture operations.									6	0	0	6	0	6			1522-2055			WOS:000248057400013

From Ginzburg-Landau to Hilbert-Einstein via Yamabe								PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS				380				115	162		10.1016/j.physa.2007.02.053			JUL 1 2007	2007	In this paper, based on some mathematical results obtained by Yamabe, Osgood, Phillips and Sarnak, we demonstrate that in dimensions three and higher the famous Ginzburg Landau equations used in the theory of phase transitions can be obtained (without any approximations) by minimization of the Riemannian-type Hilbert-Einstein action functional for pure gravity in the presence of cosmological term. We use this observation in order to bring to completion the work by Lifshitz (done in 1941) on group-theoretical refinements of the Landau theory of phase transitions. In addition, this observation allows us to develop a systematic extension to higher dimensions of known string-theoretic path integral methods developed for calculation of observables in two-dimensional conformal field theories.

To enhance DED resistance, Agrobacterium was used to transform American elm with a transgene encoding the synthetic antimicrobial peptide ESF39A, driven by a vascular promoter from American chestnut. Four unique, single-copy transgenic lines were produced and regenerated into whole plants. These lines showed less wilting and significantly less sapwood staining than non-transformed controls after O. novo-ulmi inoculation. Preliminary observations indicated that mycorrhizal colonization was not significantly different between transgenic and wild-type trees. Although the trees tested were too young to ensure stable resistance was achieved, these results indicate that transgenes encoding antimicrobial peptides reduce DED symptoms and therefore hold promise for enhancing pathogen resistance in American elm.									33	0	0	33	0	34			0721-7714			WOS:000247971700014	17310333

Effect of ethanol rinse, Lactobacillus fermentum inoculation, and modified atmosphere on ground chicken meat quality								POULTRY SCIENCE				86	7			1424	1430					JUL 2007	2007	Ground chicken breast meat was prepared using combinations of the following treatments: ethanol rinse before grinding, inoculation with Lactobacillus fermentum after grinding, and modified atmosphere packaging in either 90% O-2 and 10% CO2 or 90% N-2 and 10% CO2. Control treatments included water rinse and noninoculation with L. fermentum. Packaged meat was refrigerated and sampled for various shelf-life quality indices on d 0, 3, and 6. The inoculation with L. fermentum had little or no effect on ground meat shelf life. The ethanol-rinsed meat had lower off-odor scores and lower microbial growth compared to nonethanol rinsed meat. The high-N-2 atmosphere maintained meat color better than the high-O-2 packaging, but there was no effect on microbial growth. The combination of ethanol rinsing and high-N2 packaging extended ground chicken quality compared with meat rinsed in water and packaged in high O-2.									3	0	0	2	0	3			0032-5791			WOS:000247429300020	17575191

J	Zhang, Dalun; Katsiyannis, Antonis; Barrett, David E.; Willson, Victor								Truancy offenders in the juvenile justice system - Examinations of first and second referrals								REMEDIAL AND SPECIAL EDUCATION				28	4			244	256					JUL-AUG 2007	2007	Truancy has been identified as one of the top 10 educational problems in the United States and is considered an important predictor of later delinquent behavior. The purpose of this study was to track youth initially referred to the juvenile justice system because of truancy. Data were provided by the South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice (SCDJJ). The sample was drawn from a cohort of 12,468 juveniles, all born in 1985. A longitudinal approach was taken to examine truancy offenders' interactions with the SCDJJ at their first and second referrals. Compared to non-truancy referrals, youth who are first referred for truancy are more likely to be European American and female and less likely to have a history of serious drug use. Furthermore, they are less likely to be referred for more serious crimes later in their youth and, if later incarcerated, experience shorter commitments. The results of the present study suggest that youth who are referred to the juvenile justice system for truancy represent a distinct group of juvenile offenders compared to youth who are referred for other offenses. Implications of these findings for policy and future research are addressed.									16	0	0	0	0	16			0741-9325			WOS:000248512400004

J	Young, Shawn P.; Isely, J. Jeffery								Diel behavior of adult striped bass using tailwater habitat as summer refuge								TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY				136	4			1104	1112		10.1577/T06-183.1			JUL 2007	2007	General patterns of summer diel distribution and movement were identified for adult striped bass Morone saxatilis using tailwater habitat influenced by the diel operation cycle of a hydroelectric dam during the summers of 2003 and 2004. Striped bass distribution within the tailwater was similar during each diel-tracking event and across both summers. The majority of fish remained within the tailwater the entire summer; however, some made periodic excursions to and from the tailwater throughout the summer. Further, most striped bass were located within 0.5 kin of Richard B. Russell Dam during all stages of operation on all occasions-probably because of the constant availability of optimal habitat during all three stages of operation on all diel-tracking events. The diel cycle of dam operation, which included pumped storage during each summer, did not degrade tailwater habitat below optimal conditions, according to summer habitat suitability index values for inland adult striped bass. Movement was significantly higher during hydroelectric generation operations than during no-generation and pumped storage periods in summer 2003; this difference was not apparent during summer 2004. Mean absolute movement peaked during hydroelectric generation on six of eight diel-tracking events. During both summers, movement was directed up-reservoir during no-generation and generation periods and down-reservoir during pumped storage. Mean total daily movement rates ranged from 0.59 to 4.04 km/d and were greater than those previously estimated from bimonthly sampling for this population. Total daily movement rate peaked during the first tracking event each summer and then declined as summer progressed. These findings suggest that hydroelectric discharges affect adult striped bass behavior, but the effects are not adverse as long as habitat is not degraded by hydroelectric facility operations.									5	0	0	5	0	5			0002-8487			WOS:000248203500021
