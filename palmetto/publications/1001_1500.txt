J	Niaki, Farbod Akhavan; Ulutan, Durul; Mears, Laine								Parameter Inference Under Uncertainty in End-Milling gamma '-Strengthened Difficult-to-Machine Alloy								JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME				138	6					061014	10.1115/1.4033041			JUN 2016	2016	Nickel-based alloys are those of materials that are maintaining their strength at high temperature. This feature makes these alloys a suitable candidate for power generation industry. However, high wear rate and tooling cost are known as the challenges in machining Ni-based alloys. The high wear rate causes a rapid failure of the tool, and therefore, fewer data will be available for model development. In addition, variations in material properties and hardness, residual stress, tool runout, and tolerances are some uncontrollable effects adding uncertainties to the currently developed models. To address these challenges, a probabilistic Bayesian approach using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method has been used in this work. The MCMC method is a powerful tool for parameter inference and quantification of embedded uncertainties of models. It is shown that by adding a prior probability to the observation probability, fewer experiments are required for inference. This is specifically useful in model development for difficult-to-machine alloys where high wear rate lowers the cardinality of the dataset. The combined Gibbs-Metropolis algorithm as a subset of MCMC method has been used in this work to quantify the uncertainty of the unknown parameters in a mechanistic tool wear model for end-milling of a difficult-to-machine Ni-based alloy. Maximum of 18% error and average error of 11% in the results show a good potential of this modeling in prediction of parameters in the presence of uncertainties when limited experiments are available.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1087-1357	1528-8935		WOS:000376591100015		
J	Zhou, Binbin; Luo, Hong; Qu, Rongda				Zhou, Man/S-4256-2016				Expression of the shrimp antimicrobial peptide penaeidin 4-1 confers resistance against brown patch disease in tall fescue								PLANT CELL TISSUE AND ORGAN CULTURE				125	3			599	603		10.1007/s11240-016-0963-z			JUN 2016	2016	Tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) is an important grass widely used in North Carolina and other transition zone states in the US for turf and as forage. Brown patch caused by subgroup AG1-AI of Rhizoctonia solani is the most severe and frequently occurring fungal disease for tall fescue plants. The objective of this research was to genetically engineer tall fescue to improve its resistance to the pathogen. The gene (Pen4-1) of a novel antimicrobial peptide-Penaeidin 4-1 from a shrimp species was introduced into tall fescue var. 'Coronado' through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Among the five transgenic plants containing the Pen4-1 transgene, four of them displayed significantly higher level of resistance against R. solani subgroup AG1-IA, with two being highly resistant (p < 0.001). Up to 75 % reduction of the lesion size was achieved. The results indicate that Pen4-1 confers resistance to various subgroups of R. solani and is a promising candidate for engineered resistance to a wide-spectrum pathogens in tall fescue.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0167-6857	1573-5044		WOS:000376603200017

The most important factors related to the likely use of ad hoc interpreters (cutting corners) included locating a qualified interpreter, having to wait for a qualified interpreter, and technical difficulties regarding phone and video technology.CONCLUSION: Health care organizations may benefit from increasing staff awareness about patient safety and legal and regulatory risks involved with the use of ad hoc interpreters.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1938-8993		MEDLINE:27257220	27257220	
J	Pitts, Brandon; Riggs, Sara L.; Sarter, Nadine								Crossmodal Matching: A Critical but Neglected Step in Multimodal Research								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON HUMAN-MACHINE SYSTEMS				46	3			445	450		10.1109/THMS.2015.2501420			JUN 2016	2016	Research on multimodal information processing has seen a surge in recent years. Most of this research suffers from a significant shortcoming: the failure to perform crossmodal matching. Crossmodal matching refers to equating perceived intensities of stimuli across two sensory modalities. This step is critical for avoiding that modality is confounded with other signal properties. Very few studies include this step, and there is no agreed-upon matching technique. An experiment comparing two different approaches shows that even minor variations can lead to significant differences in match values and intraindividual match variability. Our findings highlight the need for developing and employing a valid crossmodal matching procedure for future studies.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2168-2291	2168-2305		WOS:000376110800012

Another challenge is that advanced tumor cells often evade immunosurveillance of the immune system as well as of the Fas-mediated apoptosis by various mechanisms. We report the design and preliminary evaluation of the antitumor activity of a novel fusion protein-mIL-12/FasTI, consisting of mouse interleukin-12 and the transmembrane and intracellular domains of mouse Fas. The fusion construct (pmIL-12/FasTI) was transfected into mouse lung carcinoma cell line TC-1. Stable cell clones expressing the fusion protein were established as assayed by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. ELISA and cell proliferation analyses demonstrated that NK cells were effectively activated by the fusion protein with increased IFN-gamma production and cytotoxicity. Enhanced caspase-3 activity of the clones when co-cultured with NK cells indicated that apoptosis was induced through Fas/FasL signaling pathway. The preliminary results suggest a synergized anticancer activity of the fusion protein. It may represent a promising therapeutic agent for cancer treatment.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1019-6439	1791-2423		WOS:000375807900017	27081758

This class contains many important classes of operators, including: short time Fourier transform multipliers, Calderon-Toeplitz operators, Toeplitz operators on various functions spaces, Anti-Wick operators, some pseudodifferential operators, some Calderon-Zygmund operators, and many others. In this paper, we study the boundedness and compactness of weakly localized operators. In particular, we provide a characterization of compactness for weakly localized operators in terms of the behavior of their Berezin transforms.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1069-5869	1531-5851		WOS:000376246800003

We test whether building through the draft promotes winning in several ways. We test whether having more and higher draft picks promotes improvement and whether giving draft picks more playing time helps teams win more. We find that the draft is not necessarily the best road to success. An excellent organization and General Manager better enable teams to succeed even without high draft picks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1527-0025	1552-7794		WOS:000376290800004

The majority of works in electrodynamics were inspired by the influential paper by Ranada (Lett Math Phys 18:97-106, 1989) and its subsequent refinements. In this work and in its companion we analyze Ranada's results using methods of contact geometry and topology. Not only our analysis allows us to reproduce his major results but in addition, it provides opportunities for considerably extending the catalog of the known/obtained knot types. In addition, it allows to reinterpret both the electric and magnetic charges purely geometrically thus opening the possibility of treatment of masses and charges in Yang-Mills and gravitational fields purely geometrically.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1664-2368	1664-235X		WOS:000375673500003		
J	Kinley, Ciera M.; McQueen, Andrew D.; Rodgers, John H., Jr.								Comparative responses of freshwater organisms to exposures of a commercial naphthenic acid								CHEMOSPHERE				153				170	178		10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.03.002			JUN 2016	2016	Comparative toxicity studies using unconfounded exposures can prioritize the selection of sensitive sentinel test species and refine methods for evaluating ecological risks of complex mixtures like naphthenic acids (NAs), a group of organic acids associated with crude oils and energy-derived waters that have been a source of aquatic toxicity. The objectives of this study were to compare responses of freshwater aquatic organisms (vertebrate, invertebrates, and a macrophyte; in terms of acute toxicity) to Fluka commercial NAs and to compare measured toxicity data with peer-reviewed toxicity data for other commercial NA sources and energy-derived NA sources. Exposures were confirmed using high performance liquid chromatography. Responses (7-d LC50s/EC50) ranged from 1.9 mg L-1 for Pimephales promelas to 56.2 mg L-1 for Typha latifolia. Following P. promelas in order of decreasing sensitivity were Ceriodaphnia dubia (7-d LC50 = 2.8 mg L-1), Hyalella azteca (7-d LC50 = 4.1 mg L-1), Chironomus dilutus (7-d LC50 = 6.5 mg L-1), and T. latifolia (7-d EC50 = 56.2 mg L-1), indicating that in terms of sensitivities, fish > invertebrates > plant for Fluka NAs in this study. Factors that affect exposures and measurements of exposures differ among commercial and energy-derived NAs and constrain comparisons. Despite differences in exposures, fish and invertebrates were relatively sensitive to both commercial and energy-derived NA sources (based on laboratory measurements and peer-reviewed data) and could be appropriate sentinel species for risk evaluations.

The problem often arises in environmental series, where most time-ordered data display some type of periodic structure. This paper reviews the problem, proposing new statistics in both the time and frequency domains. Our new time domain statistic has an analysis of variance form that is based on the one-step-ahead prediction errors of the series. This statistic inherits the classic traits of the F -distribution arising in one-way analysis of variance tests, is easy to use, and is asymptotically equivalent to the likelihood ratio test. The statistics asymptotic distribution is quantified when time series parameters are estimated. In the frequency domain, a statistic modifying Fisher's classical test for a sinusoidal mean superimposed on independent and identically distributed Gaussian noise is devised. The performance and comparison of these statistics are studied via simulation. Implementation of the methods merely requires sample means, autocovariances, and periodograms of the series. Application to a data set of monthly temperatures from Tuscaloosa, Alabama, is given. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1180-4009	1099-095X		WOS:000375771000001		
J	Ash, Erin								Priming or Proteus Effect? Examining the Effects of Avatar Race on In-Game Behavior and Post-Play Aggressive Cognition and Affect in Video Games								GAMES AND CULTURE				11	4			422	440		10.1177/1555412014568870			JUN 2016	2016	This research uses a 2 x 2 factorial experiment to further investigate the Proteus effect for avatar race observed in previous research by measuring in-game behavior, the use of stereotypes to describe the avatar, and perceived embodiment of the avatar. Participants played a boxing video game as White or Black avatar against a White or Black avatar. Results revealed no main effects for avatar race, but embodiment was found to moderate the relationship between avatar race and in-game behavior. Subsequent probing of this interaction revealed that the Proteus effect was demonstrated for those who experienced greater embodiment. Avatar race was unrelated to the use of stereotypes, but main effects for aggressive cognition and affect were found. Also, same-race conditions demonstrated increased aggressive behavior compared to opposite-race conditions. Theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1555-4120	1555-4139		WOS:000375769800004

Multiple reflectors are implemented along a coaxial cable, where every two consecutive reflectors can be considered as a low finesse CCFPI, which has a relatively weak reflection coefficient and insertion loss. The interferogram in a frequency domain of each individual CCFPI could be reconstructed through the proposed signal processing method, so that the phase detection could be applied to any CCFPIs on one cable to achieve high measurement accuracy. A large capacity sensor network with a relatively high measurement accuracy can be implemented simultaneously. The concept takes advantage of the time-domain multiplexing method and the pure frequency domain measurement, which is herein called a joint-time-frequency demodulation technique. Due to its effectiveness and robustness, the device is especially attractive for structural, downhole, or underwater applications.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1530-437X	1558-1748		WOS:000375563700062

An examination of interviewers' decision-making time across applicants								JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY				89	2			223	248		10.1111/joop.12118			JUN 2016	2016	We develop and test a model of factors that may account for how quickly interviewers make decisions about job applicants. Data were collected from 166 interviewers who interviewed applicants (N=691) at a university career centre. Results revealed that interviewers who possessed more experience and higher interviewing efficacy tended to make quicker decisions, as did interviewers who engaged in more rapport building. In contrast, use of question consistency (a key element of structured interviews) tended to increase the time interviewers took to make their decisions. Consistent with cognitive load theory, interview decision time had a curvilinear relationship with applicant order. Specifically, decision time increased as interviewers progressed through the first few applicants, but after about four applicants, decision time reached an asymptote and then began to decrease as interviewers evaluated additional applicants. These findings have implications for the design of future interview research (e.g., accounting for intra-interviewer changes in decision-making time across applicants), as well as for the use of interviews in organizations (e.g., designing interviews and interview schedules that discourage quick decisions).									0	0	0	0	0	0			0963-1798	2044-8325		WOS:000375725900001

Yet, because of the narrow approach to STEM, educational leaders continue to call for a more balanced approach to teaching and learning, which includes the arts, design, and humanities. This desire created space for science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) education, a transdisciplinary approach that focuses on problem-solving. STEAM-based curricula and STEAM-themed schools are appearing all over the globe. This growing national and global attention to STEAM provides an opportunity for teacher education to explore the ways in which teachers implement STEAM practices, examining the successes and challenges, and how teachers are beginning to make sense of this innovative teaching practice. The purpose of this paper is to examine the implementation of STEAM teaching practices in science and math middle school classrooms, in hopes to provide research-based evidence on this emerging topic to guide teacher educators.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1059-0145	1573-1839		WOS:000375574100005

Thompson								Continuous synthesis of iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles via thermal decomposition								PARTICUOLOGY				26				47	53		10.1016/j.partic.2015.09.011			JUN 2016	2016	Iron oxide nanoparticles have become of great interest in the medical field for their potential uses in areas such as biomagnetic imaging and hypothermia cancer treatment. Traditionally, particles for these applications are produced through batch-based methodologies. Herein, we demonstrate an alternative continuous flow production method for the synthesis of Fe3O4 iron oxide nanoparticles. Advantages of continuous flow over the batch method include consistent formation of uniformly spherical particles, thorough mixing of reactants, and capacity for high-volume particle production. In this study, a continuous flow reaction mechanism was proposed in which stoichiometric control of reactants had the potential to control final particle size. The project was conducted under the supposition that the iron oleate/ligand ratio in the precursor was the greatest size control factor, with a higher ratio resulting in smaller particles. The resulting particles produced by this continuous method were characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and magnetometry.

Typical enforcement via nodal interpolation is not flux-preserving in general, and it can create divergence error even when divergence-free elements axe used. We show with analysis and numerical tests that by slightly (and locally) changing nodal interpolation, the enforcement recovers flux-preservation, is optimally accurate, and delivers divergence-free solutions when used with divergence-free finite elements.

Facing the challenges from reducing emissions coupled with rising raw material prices and energy costs, manufacturers are trying to balance the energy usage strategy among the total energy consumption, economy, and environment, which can be self-conflicting at times. In this paper, energy systems in manufacturing environments are reviewed, and the current status of onsite energy system and renewable energy usage are discussed. Single objective and multicriteria optimization approaches are effectively formulated for making the best use of energy delivered to the production processes. Energy supply operation suggestions based on the optimization results are obtained. Finally, an example from an automotive assembly manufacturer is described to demonstrate the energy usage in the current manufacturing plants and how the optimization approaches can be applied to satisfy the energy management objectives. According to the optimization results, in an energy oriented operation, it takes 35% more in monetary cost; while in an economy oriented operation, it takes 17% more in megawatt hour energy supply and tends to rely more on the inexpensive renewable energy.

J	Sharma, Girish; Tewari, Sumanta								Tunneling conductance for Majorana fermions in spin-orbit coupled semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures using superconducting leads								PHYSICAL REVIEW B				93	19					195161	10.1103/PhysRevB.93.195161			MAY 31 2016	2016	It has been recently pointed out that the use of a superconducting (SC) lead instead of a normal metal lead can suppress the thermal broadening effects in tunneling conductance from Majorana fermions, helping reveal the quantized conductance of 2e(2)/h. In this paper we discuss the specific case of tunneling conductance with SC leads of spin-orbit coupled semiconductor-superconductor (SM-SC) heterostructures in the presence of a Zeeman field, a system which has been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally using a metallic lead. We examine the dI/dV spectra using a SC lead for different sets of physical parameters including temperature, tunneling strength, wire length, magnetic field, and induced SC pairing potential in the SM nanowire. We conclude that in a finite wire the Majorana splitting energy Delta E, which has nontrivial dependence on these physical parameters, remains responsible for the dI/dV peak broadening, even when the temperature broadening is suppressed by the SC gap in the lead. In a finite wire the signatures of Majorana fermions with a SC lead are oscillations of quasi-Majorana peaks about bias V = +/- Delta(lead), in contrast to the case of metallic leads where such oscillations are about zero bias. Our results will be useful for analysis of future experiments on SM-SC heterostructures using SC leads.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2469-9950	2469-9969		WOS:000376920400002

Fluorescence properties of the fluorophores have been studied both in a solution state and in a solid polyvinyltoluene (PVT) resin matrix of different porosity. The synthesized fluorophores were found to be promising candidates for application in plastic scintillators for detection of ionizing radiation (alpha, beta particles, gamma rays and neutrons) and demonstrated superior efficiency in comparison to the existing commercially used fluorophores (2-(1-naphthyl)-5-phenyloxazole (aNPO), 9,10-diphenylanthracene, etc.). Moreover, the suggested synthetic route allows functionalization of the fluorophores with a vinyl group for further covalent bound to the PVT or other vinyl polymer matrices, which dramatically improves chemical stability of the system simultaneously improving the photoluminescence quantum yield. Possible mechanisms of the enhanced scintillation properties are discussed based on preliminary quantum mechanical calculations and spectroscopic characteristics of the fluorophores under study.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244			WOS:000376825800035	27163887

It enables searches for transient phenomena over timescales from milliseconds to years. Among these phenomena could be electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave (GW) sources. In this paper, we present a detailed study of the LAT observations relevant to Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) event GW150914, which is the first direct detection of gravitational waves and has been interpreted as being due to the coalescence of two stellar-mass black holes. The localization region for GW150914 was outside the LAT FoV at the time of the GW signal. However, as part of routine survey observations, the LAT observed the entire LIGO localization region within similar to 70 minutes of the trigger and thus enabled a comprehensive search for a.-ray counterpart to GW150914. The study of the LAT data presented here did not find any potential counterparts to GW150914, but it did provide limits on the presence of a transient counterpart above 100 MeV on timescales of hours to days over the entire GW150914 localization region.									9	0	0	0	0	9			2041-8205	2041-8213		WOS:000376391700002		
J	Razzaghi, Talayeh; Roderick, Oleg; Safro, Ilya; Marko, Nicholas								Multilevel Weighted Support Vector Machine for Classification on Healthcare Data with Missing Values								PLOS ONE				11	5					e0155119	10.1371/journal.pone.0155119			MAY 19 2016	2016	This work is motivated by the needs of predictive analytics on healthcare data as represented by Electronic Medical Records. Such data is invariably problematic: noisy, with missing entries, with imbalance in classes of interests, leading to serious bias in predictive modeling. Since standard data mining methods often produce poor performance measures, we argue for development of specialized techniques of data-preprocessing and classification. In this paper, we propose a new method to simultaneously classify large datasets and reduce the effects of missing values. It is based on a multilevel framework of the cost-sensitive SVM and the expected maximization imputation method for missing values, which relies on iterated regression analyses. We compare classification results of multilevel SVM-based algorithms on public benchmark datasets with imbalanced classes and missing values as well as real data in health applications, and show that our multilevel SVM-based method produces fast, and more accurate and robust classification results.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000376291100028	27195952

Large-Scale Gene Relocations following an Ancient Genome Triplication Associated with the Diversification of Core Eudicots								PLOS ONE				11	5					e0155637	10.1371/journal.pone.0155637			MAY 19 2016	2016	Different modes of gene duplication including whole-genome duplication (WGD), and tandem, proximal and dispersed duplications are widespread in angiosperm genomes. Small-scale, stochastic gene relocations and transposed gene duplications are widely accepted to be the primary mechanisms for the creation of dispersed duplicates. However, here we show that most surviving ancient dispersed duplicates in core eudicots originated from large-scale gene relocations within a narrow window of time following a genome triplication (gamma) event that occurred in the stem lineage of core eudicots. We name these surviving ancient dispersed duplicates as relocated. duplicates. In Arabidopsis thaliana, relocated., WGD and single-gene duplicates have distinct features with regard to gene functions, essentiality, and protein interactions. Relative to. duplicates, relocated. duplicates have higher non-synonymous substitution rates, but comparable levels of expression and regulation divergence. Thus, relocated. duplicates should be distinguished from WGD and single-gene duplicates for evolutionary investigations. Our results suggest large-scale gene relocations following the. event were associated with the diversification of core eudicots.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000376291100073	27195960

Fiber NA has traditionally been limited to 0.06, mostly due to the control tolerance in the fabrication process. It has been recognized recently that transverse mode instability is a major limit to average power scaling in fiber lasers. One effective method to mitigate this limit is to operate nearer to the single-mode regime. Lower fiber NA is critical in this since it allows relatively larger core diameters which is the key to mitigate the limits imposed by nonlinear effects. We have developed a fabrication process of ytterbium-doped silica glass which is capable of highly accurate refractive index control and sufficient uniformity for LMA fibers. This process is also capable of large-volume production. It is based on a significant amount of post-processing once the fiber preforms are made. We have demonstrated 30/400 and 40/400 LMA fibers with a NA of similar to 0.028 operating very close to the single-mode regime. The second-order mode cuts off at similar to 1.2 mu m and similar to 1.55 mu m respectively. We have also studied issues related to bend losses due to the low NA and further optimization of LMA fibers.

J	Johnson, Bethany A.; Barrett, Kyle; Homyack, Jessica A.; Baldwin, Robert F.								Anuran occupancy and breeding site use of aquatic systems in a managed pine landscape								FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT				368				45	54		10.1016/j.foreco.2016.03.004			MAY 15 2016	2016	Although the southeastern United States has >12 million ha of intensively managed pine forest, we have a poor understanding of how aquatic systems embedded in managed landscapes contribute to biodiversity. Further, the influence of local- and landscape-scale environmental factors on occupancy of aquatic habitat types by wetland-breeding species in managed forests is unclear. Thus, we investigated anuran occupancy across three ephemeral aquatic system types (altered sites, unaltered sites, and roadside ditches) embedded in an intensively managed pine landscape in eastern North Carolina, USA. These aquatic systems varied in management, disturbance intensity, and landscape context. Altered sites are actively managed as part of the surrounding plantation, unaltered sites are avoided by silvicultural activities (set aside), and ditches receive maintenance as part of routine forest management. We examined occupancy of anuran species at 53 aquatic sites surrounded by early-, mid-, or late-rotation aged stands. During January-July 2013-2014, we conducted repeated call surveys for anurans at aquatic sites and detected 14 species. We used single-species, multi-season occupancy models to examine associations between species occupancy and site- and landscape-scale habitat characteristics for 9 commonly encountered anurans as a function of aquatic system type and stand age class while accounting for imperfect detection. Detection probabilities by species ranged from 0.27 to 0.53 and increased seasonally through the year for most anurans. Species occupancy ranged in 2013 from 0.28 to 0.81 and in 2014 from 0.33 to 0.82. Species occupancy varied by aquatic system type, but the stand age surrounding an aquatic site had little effect on occupancy for most anurans we modeled. Our results indicate that local-scale factors commonly had a larger influence than landscape context on anuran occupancy. We detected evidence of breeding across all aquatic systems and stand age classes, suggesting at least a subset of species are calling and reproductively active. Our study highlights how novel landscape structure and reconfigured ephemeral aquatic systems embedded in intensively managed forests can support anuran occupancy across a range of disturbance intensities.

It has been applied as an agent to stabilize farmland soils containinated both by arsenic and heavy metals in the Republic of Korea. However, the efficacy of this technique has not been established yet under anoxic conditions such as in the case of submerged rice paddy fields. Under anoxic conditions, As might be dissociated easily from solid surfaces where it is adsorbed reversibly. In this study, laboratory-scale column tests were conducted to artificially manipulate anoxic conditions in submerged paddy fields and we observed the release behavior of As and heavy metals, mainly cadmium (Cd). Limestone (LS) was also applied in the test for the purpose of comparison because it is usually applied as a common additive. The leachate samples were collected and chemical changes were monitored during the test period. Results suggest that anoxic conditions were developed during submersion, and that As or heavy metal fractions bound to ferrous (Fe)/manganese (Mn) oxides were easily dissociated. However, it was also shown that SS and LS significantly decreased the dissolution of Cd and As in the pore water; their removal rates in the SS-treated soil were 87% and 32%, respectively, of those in the control soil. On the other hand it appeared that SS was more effective than LS to stabilize Cd as well as As under submerged conditions. Therefore, SS might be an optimal stabilizing agent for dealing with As and other heavy metal contaminants in rice paddy soils that are periodically exposed to reducing environments.

SAPPs of three different molecular weights (MWs) were exposed to a room temperature environment with a relative humidity of 45%, and the dynamics of water mobility and distribution were monitored by LF-NMR. Results revealed that there were four transverse relaxation time fractions in SAPPs. The major (over 90%) fraction was bound water, and the distribution of water in samples with different MWs was different. The moisture absorption capacity of SAPPs with MWs of less than 1 kDa was the strongest, and all T-2 fractions/water population contents in SAPPs with MWs of 1-3 kDa were the lowest. This study provided an effective real-time monitoring method for water mobility and distribution in SAPPs and may have applications for promoting peptides quality assurance. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Temperature-Dependence of Multiphonon Relaxation of Rare-Earth Ions in Solid-State Hosts								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				120	18			9958	9964		10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b01466			MAY 12 2016	2016	Rare-earth ions are used in a wide range of emissive devices ranging from lasers to displays where high optical efficiency and narrow line widths are important. While their radiative properties are important, nonradiative properties are also critical since they can reduce optical efficiency and generate heat. In this article, theories for multiphonon relaxation rate are reviewed for rare-earth excited states in solid-state dielectric hosts. A range of various approaches are used to simplify the mathematical form of the rate equations. The H-2(9/2) excited state of Er3+, responsible for a technologically significant green emission, is modeled to show how the various theories manifest an order-of-magnitude variation in the thermal dependence of the multiphonon relaxation rate, as well as anomalous local minima in phonon scattering for temperatures above 0 K. This work proposes a corrective term of two quanta (Delta nu = +2) of the mediating phonon energy to energy gap, so the calculated and the experimentally determined relaxation rates are equal. Radiative quantum efficiencies of both the (1)G(4) -> H-3(5) approximate to 1.3 mu m and F-3(3) -> F-3(2) approximate to 7 mu m of Pr3+ are calculated to show the importance of both proper measurement of phonon energy and application of the multiphonon relaxation rate theory.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1932-7447			WOS:000375969000045

Roman {2}-domination								DISCRETE APPLIED MATHEMATICS				204				22	28		10.1016/j.dam.2015.11.013			MAY 11 2016	2016	In this paper, we initiate the study of a variant of Roman dominating functions. For a graph G = (V, E), a Roman {2}-dominating function f : V -> {0, 1, 2} has the property that for every vertex v is an element of V with f (v) = 0, either v is adjacent to a vertex assigned 2 under f, or v is adjacent to least two vertices assigned 1 under f. The weight of a Roman {2}-dominating function is the sum Sigma(v is an element of V)f (v), and the minimum weight of a Roman {2}-dominating function f is the Roman {2}-domination number. First, we present bounds relating the Roman {2}-domination number to some other domination parameters. In particular, we show that the Roman {2}-domination number is bounded above by the 2-rainbow domination number. Moreover, we prove that equality between these two parameters holds for trees and cactus graphs with no even cycles. Finally, we show that associated decision problem for Roman {2}-domination is NP-complete, even for bipartite graphs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Large Area Telescope (LAT) of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) localized by the Swift. spacecraft, which were not detected by the LAT but which fell within the instrument's field of view at the time of trigger. We examine a total of 79 GRBs by comparing the observed counts over a range of time intervals to that expected from designated background orbits, as well as by using a joint likelihood technique to model the expected distribution of stacked counts. We find strong evidence for subthreshold emission at MeV to GeV energies using both techniques. This observed excess is detected during intervals that include and exceed the durations typically characterizing the prompt emission observed at keV energies and lasts at least 2700 s after the co-aligned burst trigger. By utilizing a novel cumulative likelihood analysis, we find that although a burst's prompt gamma-ray and afterglow X-ray flux both correlate with the strength of the subthreshold emission, the X-ray afterglow flux measured by Swift's X-ray Telescope at 11 hr post trigger correlates far more significantly. Overall, the extended nature of the subthreshold emission and its connection to the burst's afterglow brightness lend. further support to the external forward shock origin of the late-time emission detected by the LAT. These results suggest that the extended high-energy emission observed by the LAT may be a relatively common feature but remains undetected in a majority of bursts owing. to instrumental threshold effects.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000377204900011

In this work, carbon dots were evaluated for their photoinduced bactericidal functions, with the results suggesting that the dots were highly effective in bacteria-killing with visible-light illumination. In fact, the inhibition effect could be observed even simply under ambient room lighting conditions. Mechanistic implications of the results are discussed and so are opportunities in the further development of carbon dots into a new class of effective visible/natural light responsible bactericidal agents for a variety of bacteria control applications.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1944-8244			WOS:000375520700014	27064729

This act generated significant media attention and prompted discussions via Facebook and Twitter. Two notable venues on social media for these conversations were the "Boycott the St. Louis Rams" Facebook page and the Twitter hashtag #BoycottRams. A thematic analysis of 1,019 user-generated Facebook comments and 452 tweets was conducted through the lens of social identity threat management. Six primary themes emerged: (a) renouncing fandom, (b) punishment commentary, (c) racial commentary, (d) general criticism, (e) attacking other group members, and (f) presenting the "facts" of the case. The results suggest that social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter serve as forums where group members discuss and debate challenges to group values and promote action steps that can mitigate social identity threats. This form of protest holds implications for minority athletes' activism efforts and sport organization administrators.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1520-5436	1532-7825		WOS:000372118100005

Stud Rail Systems as Shear Reinforcement in Beams and One-Way Slabs								ACI STRUCTURAL JOURNAL				113	3			587	594		10.14359/51688627			MAY-JUN 2016	2016	Stud rails systems (SRSs) are prefabricated reinforcement elements with headed steel studs welded to a steel base rail. SRSs can affect construction efficiency and can be used in members that are too small for hooked bars. Provisions for using SRSs in slabs and footings were introduced in ACI 318-08; however, there are currently no provisions in ACI 318 for using SRSs as shear reinforcement in one-way members. Accordingly, an experimental program was conducted to evaluate SRSs as shear reinforcement in one-way beams and slabs. Variables in the program included specimen dimensions, shear span-depth ratio, and type and spacing of shear reinforcement. Details of the program are presented, and experimental results are compared with provisions from ACI 318 to evaluate their applicability to one-way members reinforced with SRS. Experimental results from other researchers are also included in the code comparison.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0889-3241	1944-7361		WOS:000388213500015

MOCHA Collaborative Grp						In Vitro Validation of a Multiscale Patient-Specific Norwood Palliation Model								ASAIO JOURNAL				62	3			317	324		10.1097/MAT.0000000000000336			MAY-JUN 2016	2016	In Norwood physiology, shunt size and the occurrence of coarctation can affect hemodynamics significantly. The aim of the study was to validate an in vitro model of the Norwood circulation against clinical measurements for patients presenting differing aortic morphologies. The mock circulatory system used coupled a lumped parameter network of the neonatal Norwood circulation with modified Blalock-Taussig (mBT) shunt with a three-dimensional aorta model. Five postoperative aortic arch anatomies of differing morphologies were reconstructed from imaging data, and the system was tuned to patient-specific clinical values. Experimentally measured flow rates and pressures were compared with clinical measurements. Time-based experimental and clinical pressure and flow signals within the aorta and pulmonary circulation branches agreed closely (0.72 < R-2 < 0.95) for the five patients, whereas mean values within the systemic and pulmonary branches showed no significant differences (95% confidence interval). We validated an experimental multiscale model of the Norwood circulation with mBT shunt by showing it capable of reproducing clinical pressure and flow rates at various positions of the circulation with very good fidelity across a range of patient physiologies and morphologies. The multiscale aspect of the model provides a means to study variables in isolation with their effects both locally and at the system level. The model serves as a tool to further the understanding of the complex physiology of single-ventricle circulation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1058-2916	1538-943X		WOS:000387863100019	26771396

New products and management strategies are being evaluated to find alternatives to these chemistries. Field, greenhouse, and in vitro studies were conducted to determine the efficacy of abamectin and azoxystrobin for mitigating damage to 'Empire' zoysiagrass (Zoysia japonica Steud) turf caused by a stubby-root nematode (Trichodorus obtusus Cobb, 1913). Three years of data from greenhouse trials showed differences among treatments that were not observed in field trials. Combining azoxystrobin with abamectin formulations resulted in the highest root weights of any treatment for two out of three years, increasing root weights as much as threefold relative to the control. Differences in root weights for treatments containing abamectin were seen in all 3 yr. Data from the toxicity experiments show differences among formulations of abamectin. The commercial formulation of abamectin consistently immobilized a higher percentage of T. obtusus at all concentrations and evaluation periods compared to other treatments. Results indicate abamectin and azoxystrobin are useful for managing T. obtusus on zoysiagrass.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0011-183X	1435-0653		WOS:000384754600042		
J	Bi, Jun; Zhu, Shuyong; Sun, Chen; Yao, Guang; Hu, Hongxin								Supporting Virtualized Network Functions with Stateful Data Plane Abstraction								IEEE NETWORK				30	3			40	45					MAY-JUN 2016	2016	A recent trend known as NFV attempts to replace dedicated hardware appliances with generic compute, storage, and network resources. NFV based on SDN can extend programmability and flexibility features of advanced network functions. Many of these network functions, however, need concrete state information to effectively process network flows. However, OpenFlow only provides a simple "match-action" paradigm and lacks the function of stateful processing in the SDN data plane, which limits its support of advanced network functions. Heavily relying on SDN controllers for all state maintenance incurs both scalability and performance issues. In this article, we propose a novel SDPA for the SDN data plane. A co-processing unit, the forwarding processor, is designed for SDN switches to manage state information through new instructions and state tables. We demonstrate the practicality and feasibility of our approach through a proof-of-concept implementation of VNFs, a stateful firewall based on SDPA. Experimental results show that VNFs which need to process state information can be supported well by the SDPA architecture, and the forwarding efficiency is improved.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0890-8044	1558-156X		WOS:000383679900007

Positive and negative ordinates of K indicate focal or ambient viewing, respectively, while the abscissa serves to indicate time, so that K acts as a dynamic indicator of fluctuation between ambient/focal visual behavior. The coefficient indicates the difference between fixation duration and its subsequent saccade amplitude expressed in standard deviation units, facilitating parametric statistical testing. To validate K empirically, we test its utility by capturing ambient and focal attention during serial and parallel visual search tasks (Study 1). We then show how K quantitatively depicts the difference in scanning behaviors when attention is guided by audio description during perception of art (Study 2).									0	0	0	0	0	0			1544-3558	1544-3965		WOS:000382876200001

An Engine Thermal Management System Design for Military Ground Vehicle - Simultaneous Fan, Pump and Valve Control								SAE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PASSENGER CARS-ELECTRONIC AND ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS				9	1			243	254		10.4271/2016-01-0310			MAY 2016	2016	The pursuit of greater fuel economy in internal combustion engines requires the optimization of all subsystems including thermal management. The reduction of cooling power required by the electromechanical coolant pump, radiator fan(s), and thermal valve demands real time control strategies. To maintain the engine temperature within prescribed limits for different operating conditions, the continual estimation of the heat removal needs and the synergistic operation of the cooling system components must be accomplished. The reductions in thermal management power consumption can be achieved by avoiding unnecessary overcooling efforts which are often accommodated by extreme thermostat valve positions. In this paper, an optimal nonlinear controller for a military M-ATV engine cooling system will be presented. The prescribed engine coolant temperature will be tracked while minimizing the pump, fan( s), and valve power usage. A case study investigates the proposed control strategy's performance in comparison to other methods for temperature tracking and energy conservation. The optimal nonlinear controller offered satisfactory coolant temperature tracking with an average error of 0.35 degrees C and at least 13% reduction in total cooling power.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1946-4614	1946-4622		WOS:000383183800031

Myofibril disassembly is related to many physiological and pathological processes. This study investigated, in a cultured rat adult cardiomyocyte model, the effect of force imbalance on myofibril disassembly. The imbalance of forces that were exerted on Z-discs was induced by the synergistic effect of broken intercalated discs and actin-myosin interaction. Cardiomyocytes with well-preserved intercalated discs were isolated from adult rat ventricles. The ultrastructure of cardiomyocyte was observed using a customized two-photon excitation fluorescence and second harmonic generation imaging system. The contraction of cardiomyocytes was recorded with a highspeed CCD camera, and the movement of cellular components was analyzed using a contractile imaging assay technique. The cardiomyocyte dynamic remodeling process was recorded using a time-lapse imaging system. The role of actin-myosin interaction in myofibril disassembly was investigated by incubating cardiomyocytes with blebbistatin (25 mu M). Results demonstrated that the hierarchical disassembly process of myofibrils was initiated from cardiomyocyte free ends where intercalated discs had broken, during which the desmin network near the free cell ends was destroyed to release single myofibrils. Analysis of force (based on a schematic model of cardiomyocytes connected at intercalated discs) suggests that breaking of intercalated discs caused force imbalance on both sides of the Z-discs adjacent to the cell ends due to actin-myosin interaction. The damaged intercalated discs and actin-myosin interaction induced force imbalance on both sides of the Z-discs, which played an important role in the hierarchical disassembly of myofibrils.

The BaCO3 nanoparticles were deposited into the porous electrodes through an infiltration/impregnation method with barium acetate as the precursor. Electrochemical impedance analysis indicated that BaCO3 dramatically reduced the resistance associated with the low-frequency response, which suggests that BaCO3 greatly enhances the kinetics of the surface reaction process. Electrical conductivity relaxation experiments revealed that BaCO3 particles enlarged the oxygen chemical surface exchange coefficient by a factor of up to eight. As a result, the interfacial polarization resistance of both the LSCF and LSCF-SDC electrodes was greatly reduced, from 0.28 and 0.13 to 0.12 and 0.047 Omega cm(2), respectively, at 700 degrees C. In addition, the single-cell performance was also improved and demonstrated peak power density from 0.66 and 0.71 to 0.73 and 0.81 W cm(2) for the LSCF and LSCF-SDC cathodes, respectively, at 700 degrees C. The LSCF electrode infiltrated with BaCO3 nanoparticles also exhibited higher stability than the bare LSCF electrode in tests conducted under typical SOFC conditions for over 340 h of operation.									2	0	0	0	0	2			2196-0216			WOS:000379985500020

We estimate the age and spatial extent of lowland second-growth forests in the Latin American tropics and model their potential aboveground carbon accumulation over four decades. Our model shows that, in 2008, second-growth forests (1 to 60 years old) covered 2.4 million km(2) of land (28.1% of the total study area). Over 40 years, these lands can potentially accumulate a total aboveground carbon stock of 8.48 Pg C (petagrams of carbon) in aboveground biomass via low-cost natural regeneration or assisted regeneration, corresponding to a total CO2 sequestration of 31.09 Pg CO2. This total is equivalent to carbon emissions from fossil fuel use and industrial processes in all of Latin America and the Caribbean from 1993 to 2014. Ten countries account for 95% of this carbon storage potential, led by Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela. We model future land-use scenarios to guide national carbon mitigation policies. Permitting natural regeneration on 40% of lowland pastures potentially stores an additional 2.0 Pg C over 40 years. Our study provides information and maps to guide national-level forest-based carbon mitigation plans on the basis of estimated rates of natural regeneration and pasture abandonment. Coupled with avoided deforestation and sustainable forest management, natural regeneration of second-growth forests provides a low-cost mechanism that yields a high carbon sequestration potential with multiple benefits for biodiversity and ecosystem services.									13	0	0	7	0	13			2375-2548			WOS:000380073000014	27386528

Moreover, wireless connectivity in these systems provides new opportunities in designing flexible and smarter wireless sensor networks (WSNs).

Second, we describe Ocelot, a mobile distributed grid-like computing engine for commodity palmtop platforms. The combination of Lynx and Ocelot provides sensor nodes that are capable of collecting, recording, processing, and communicating data without any central server support. Significant energy savings can be achieved. for light to medium weight tasks through the Lynx and Ocelot combined system compared to traditional server-class grid-solutions such as BOINC. We demonstrate Lynx and Ocelot in the context of life-cycle building energy usage. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0045-7906	1879-0755		WOS:000379558500012

We aim at trapping, washing, and recovering an enriched cell fraction that will facilitate downstream analysis. We used an increasingly diluted sample of yeast, 10(6) - 10(2) cells/ml, to demonstrate the isolation and enrichment of few cells at increasing flow rates. A maximum average enrichment of 154.2 +/- 23.7 times was achieved when the sample flow rate was 10 ll/min and yeast cells were suspended in low electrically conductive media that maximizes dielectrophoresis trapping. A COMSOL Multiphysics model allowed for the comparison between experimental and simulation results. Discussion is conducted on the discrepancies between such results and how the model can be further improved. Published by AIP Publishing.

Recent work has shown that in pilot-wave field theory on expanding space relaxation to the Born rule is suppressed for long-wavelength field modes, resulting in a large-scale power deficit xi(k) which for a radiation-dominated expansion is found to have an approximate inverse-tangent dependence on k (assuming that the width of the initial distribution is smaller than the width of the initial Born-rule distribution and that the initial quantum states are evenly-weighted superpositions of energy states). In this paper, we show that the functional form of xi(k) is robust under changes in the initial nonequilibrium distribution - subject to the limitation of a subquantum width - as well as under the addition of an inflationary era at the end of the radiation-dominated phase. In both cases, the predicted deficit.(k) remains an inverse-tangent function of k. Furthermore, with the inflationary phase the dependence of the fitting parameters on the number of superposed pre-inflationary energy states is comparable to that found previously. Our results indicate that, for the assumed broad class of initial conditions, an inverse-tangent power deficit is likely to be a fairly general and robust signature of quantum relaxation in the early universe.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0218-2718	1793-6594		WOS:000378640600009

The leader acts first to select a set of items, and with knowledge of the leader's action, the follower then selects another subset of items. There exists a set of clauses, where each clause is a prioritized set of items. A clause is satisfied by the selected item having the highest priority, resulting in a reward for the player that introduced the highest-priority selected item. We examine a mixed-integer bilevel programming (MIBLP) formulation for a competitive set covering problem, assuming that both players seek to maximize their profit. This class of problems arises in several fields, including non-cooperative product introduction and facility location games. We develop an MIBLP model for this problem in which binary decision variables appear in both stages of the model. Our contribution regards a cutting-plane algorithm, based on inequalities that support the convex hull of feasible solutions and induce faces of non-zero dimension in many cases. Furthermore, we investigate alternative verification problems to equip the algorithm with cutting planes that induce higher-dimensional faces, and demonstrate that the algorithm significantly improves upon existing general solution method for MIBLPs.

Method: We used two datasets: one United States sample from 300 freshmen males from Clemson University, South Carolina and a Chinese sample of 1516 freshmen students from Shanghai University of Finance and Economics. Multiple regressions were conducted to examine the association between mindfulness (measured by Mindful Attention and Awareness Scale (MAAS)) and each of the four subscales of aggression. Results: Among the Clemson sample (N = 286), the mindfulness scale had a significant negative association with each of the four subscales of aggression: Hostility: = -0.62, p < 0.001; Verbal: = -0.37, p < 0.001; Physical: = -0.29, p < 0.001; Anger: = -0.44, p < 0.001. Among the Shanghai male subsample, the mindfulness scale had a significant negative association with each of the four subscales of aggression: Hostility: = -0.57, p < 0.001; Verbal: = -0.37, p < 0.001; Physical: = -0.35, p < 0.001; Anger: = -0.58, p < 0.001. Among the Shanghai female subsample (N = 512), the mindfulness scale had a significant negative association with each of the four subscales of aggression: Hostility: = -0.62, p < 0.001; Verbal: = -0.41, p < 0.001; Physical: = -0.52, p < 0.001; and Anger: = -0.64, p < 0.001. Discussion: Our study documents the negative association between mindfulness and physical aggression in two non-clinical samples.

Electric load optimization of a nonlinear mono-stable duffing harvester excited by white noise								MECCANICA				51	5			1027	1039		10.1007/s11012-015-0289-7			MAY 2016	2016	This paper investigates the electric load optimization of a nonlinear mono-stable Duffing energy harvester under white noise excitations considering symmetric and asymmetric nonlinear restoring forces. Statistical linearization is utilized to obtain approximate analytical expressions for the statistical averages including the average output power, which is then optimized with respect to the electric load. It is shown that the optimal load is dependent on the nonlinearity unless the ratio between the period of the mechanical system and the time constant of the harvesting circuit is large. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that, under optimal electric loading, a mono-stable Duffing harvester with a symmetric nonlinear restoring force can never produce higher average power levels than an equivalent linear harvester regardless of the magnitude of the nonlinearity. On the other hand, asymmetries in the restoring force are shown to provide performance improvements over an equivalent linear harvester.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0025-6455	1572-9648		WOS:000374345100002

Based on the spatial overlap of sources detected at GeV energies with SNRs known from radio surveys, we classify 30 sources as likely GeV SNRs. We also report 14 marginal associations and 245 flux upper limits. A mock catalog in which the positions of known remnants are scrambled in Galactic longitude allows us to determine an upper limit of 22% on the number of GeV candidates falsely identified as SNRs. We have also developed a method to estimate spectral and spatial systematic errors arising from the diffuse interstellar emission model, a key component of all Galactic Fermi LAT analyses. By studying remnants uniformly in aggregate, we measure the GeV properties common to these objects and provide a crucial context for the detailed modeling of individual SNRs. Combining our GeV results with multiwavelength (MW) data, including radio, X-ray, and TeV, we demonstrate the need for improvements to previously sufficient, simple models describing the GeV and radio emission from these objects. We model the GeV and MW emission from SNRs in aggregate to constrain their maximal contribution to observed Galactic cosmic rays.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0067-0049	1538-4365		WOS:000377050200008

Each prehomodimerizes and ligand binding activates Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathways by inducing conformational changes within receptor homodimers. In humans, GHR is activated by GH, whereas PRLR is activated by both GH and PRL. We previously devised a split luciferase complementation assay, in which 1 receptor is fused to an N-terminal luciferase (Nluc) fragment, and the other receptor is fused to a C-terminal luciferase (Cluc) fragment. When receptors approximate, luciferase activity (complementation) results. Using this assay, we reported ligand-independent GHR-GHR complementation and GH-induced complementation changes characterized by acute augmentation above basal signal, consistent with induction of conformational changes that bring GHR cytoplasmic tails closer. We also demonstrated association between GHR and PRLR in T47D human breast cancer cells by coimmunoprecipitation, suggesting that, in addition to forming homodimers, these receptors form hetero-assemblages with functional consequences. We now extend these analyses to examine basal and ligand-induced complementation of coexpressed PRLR-Nluc and PRLR-Cluc chimeras and coexpressed GHR-Nluc and PRLR-Cluc chimeras. We find that PRLR-PRLR and GHR-PRLR form specifically interacting ligand-independent assemblages and that either GH or PRL augments PRLR-PRLR complementation, much like the GH-induced changes in GHR-GHR dimers. However, in contrast to the complementation patterns for GHR-GHR or PRLR-PRLR homomers, both GH and PRL caused decline in luciferase activity for GHR-PRLR heteromers. These and other data suggest that GHR and PRLR associate in complexes comprised of GHR-GHR/PRLR-PRLR heteromers consisting of GHR homodimers and PRLR homodimers, rather than GHR-PRLR heterodimers.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0888-8809			WOS:000377209900003	27003442

Several electrode level solutions have been reported including utilizing Si nanowires, thin films, and nanoparticle assemblies, where the physical diffusion distances are kept very short. For thin film based electrodes, the benefits of the simplified structure of the electrode are countered by the low surface area and low silicon loadings. In this study we have utilized electrodeposition techniques to deposit silicon films on a porous copper substrate. This greatly increases the electrode surface area and loadings while maintaining the advantages of a thin film electrode. Using 3d-silicon electrodes without a binder or conductive matrix, stable capacities of similar to 1000 mAh/g have been achieved. In general, electrodes with lower loadings of active silicon (<1 mg/cm(2)) displayed better rate capability than electrodes with higher loadings (>2.5 mg/cm(2)). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Conducting polymers, on the other hand, possess high charge capacities; however, their application in commercial devices is hindered by degradation arising from their poor chemical and physical stability. Composites of carbon nanomaterials and conducting polymers have synergistic properties beneficial to supercapacitors, such as high capacitance and stability, but the limitations in scalable synthesis and polymer aggregation prevent widespread utilization. In this work, robust freestanding carbon nanotube (CNT)/electrically conducting polymer (ECP) electrodes are prepared using a simple dispersion filtration method, which can easily be scaled up. This process eliminates the use of binder, substrate or additional inactive weight. Composite CNT/ECP electrodes showed enhanced capacitance and charge capacity, achieving values up to 448 F/g and 84 mAh/g compared to 27 F/g and 10 mAh/g for pure CNT electrodes in aqueous electrolyte. Resulting symmetric cells exhibited energy and power densities of similar to 5 Wh/kg and similar to 283 W/kg, respectively, in aqueous electrolytes; and 12 Wh/kg and 744 W/kg, respectively, in organic electrolytes when using PEDOT/CNT electrodes. Given the process simplicity, relatively low cost and high throughput, the present composites have great potential for large-scale manufacturing of CP/CNTs supercapacitor electrodes.

Here, we use bacteria absorption of metallic Mn2+ ions to in situ synthesize natural micro-yolk shell-structure Mn2P2O7 carbon, followed by the use of vacuum filtration to obtain Mn2P2O7 carbon@reduced graphene oxides (RGO) papers for LIBs anodes. The Mn2P2O7 particles are completely encapsulated within the carbon film, which was obtained by carbonizing the bacterial wall. The resulting carbon microstructure reduces the electrode electrolyte contact area, yielding high Coulombic efficiency. In addition, the yolk shell structure with its internal void spaces is ideal for sustaining volume expansion of Mn2P2O7 during charge/discharge processes, and the carbon shells act as an ideal barrier, limiting most solid electrolyte interphase formation on the surface of the carbon films (instead of forming on individual particles). Notably, the RGO films have high conductivity and robust mechanical flexibility. As a result of our combined strategies delineated in this article, our binder-free flexible anodes exhibit high capacities, long cycle-life, and excellent rate performance.									8	0	0	0	0	8			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000376825100070	27139149

J	Zhu, Guoli; Tang, Wenqiao; Wang, Liangjiang; Wang, Cong; Wang, Xiaomei								Identification of a uniquely expanded V1R (ORA) gene family in the Japanese grenadier anchovy (Coilia nasus)								MARINE BIOLOGY				163	5					126	10.1007/s00227-016-2896-9			MAY 2016	2016	A number of studies have suggested that olfaction plays an important role in fish migration. Fish use several distinct families of olfactory receptors to detect environmental odorants, including MORs (main olfactory receptors), V1Rs (vomeronasal type-1 receptors), V2Rs (vomeronasal type-2 receptors), TAARs (trace amine-associated receptors), and FPRs (formyl peptide receptors). The V1Rs have been reported to detect pheromones, and a pheromone hypothesis for the spawning migration of anadromous fish has been proposed. Examining whether Coilia nasus relies on V1R-mediated olfaction for spawning migration is important for understanding the molecular basis of spawning migration behavior. Here, we explored the V1R gene family in anadromous C. nasus. Six V1R genes previously reported in other teleost fish were successfully identified. Interestingly, we detected the largest V1R repertoire in teleost fish from C. nasus and identified a species-specific expansion event of V1R3 gene that has previously been detected as single-copy genes in other teleost fish. The V1R loci were found to be populated with repetitive sequences, especially in the expanded V1R3 genes. Additionally, the divergence of V1R3 genetic structures in different populations of C. nasus indicates the copy number variation (CNV) in V1R3 gene among individuals of C. nasus. Most of the putative C. nasus V1R genes were expressed primarily in the olfactory epithelium, consistent with the role of the gene products as functional olfactory receptors. Significant differences in the expression levels of V1R genes were detected between the anadromous and non-anadromous C. nasus. This study represents a first step in the elucidation of the olfactory communication system of C. nasus at the molecular level. Our results indicate that some V1R genes may be involved in the spawning migration of C. nasus, and the study provides new insights into the spawning migration and genome evolution of C. nasus.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0025-3162	1432-1793		WOS:000375330500033

A Review of State Licensing Regulations to Determine Alignment with Best Practices to Prevent Human Norovirus Infections in Child-Care Centers								PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTS				131	3			449	460					MAY-JUN 2016	2016	Objectives. Close, frequent contact between children and care providers in child-care centers presents many opportunities to spread human noroviruses. We compared state licensing regulations for child-care centers with national guidelines written to prevent human noroviruses.Methods. We reviewed child-care licensing regulations for all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia in effect in June 2015 to determine if these regulations fully, partially, or did not address 14 prevention practices in four topic areas: (1) hand hygiene, (2) exclusion of ill people, (3) environmental sanitation, and (4) diapering.Results. Approximately two-thirds (8.9) of the 14 practices across all state regulations were partially or fully addressed, with few (2.6) fully addressed. Practices related to exclusion of ill people and diapering were fully addressed most often, while practices related to hand hygiene and environmental sanitation were fully addressed least often.Conclusion. Regulations based on guidelines for best practices are one way to prevent the spread of human noroviruses in child-care facilities, if the regulations are enforced. Our findings show that, in mid-2015, many state child-care regulations did not fully address these guidelines, suggesting the need to review these regulations to be sure they are based on best practices									0	0	0	0	0	0			0033-3549			WOS:000376219000011	27252565

However, the role of sulfides (as AVS) as a toxicant has been largely ignored. The aim of this research was to measure relationships of AVS (as sodium sulfide [Na2S]-amended sediment) and toxicity to a sensitive benthic amphipod Hyalella azteca to evaluate the exposure-response relationships among a series of sulfide exposures. The specific objectives were to (1) measure SEM/AVS ratios in a series of sodium sulfide (Na2S center dot 9H(2)O)-amended sediments producing a range of sulfide concentrations and (2) measure responses of H. azteca (as mortality) in 96-h static sediment toxicity tests to exposures of Na2S-amended sediments. Amended sediments had a predictable increase in AVS concentrations and a concomitant decrease in Sigma SEM/AVS ratios. Increasing concentrations of AVS resulted in a range of Sigma SEM/AVS ratios that varied over more than an order of magnitude from 0.185 to 0.006. H. azteca survival decreased with increasing concentrations of "excess" AVS, with 96-h no observable effect concentration (NOEC) and LC50 of 0.041 and 0.019 Sigma SEM/AVS, respectively. Clearly, the SEM/AVS model provides a useful tool for evaluating potential bioavailability of divalent metals and predicting ecological risk; however, this study demonstrates the need to consider sulfide (as AVS) as a potential source of toxicity in situations with low [<<1] Sigma SEM/AVS ratios.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0049-6979	1573-2932		WOS:000376276100029

Photocatalysis of a Commercial Naphthenic Acid in Water Using Fixed-Film TiO2								WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION				227	5					132	10.1007/s11270-016-2835-x			MAY 2016	2016	Photolysis or photocatalysis may provide a process for mitigating ecological risks of naphthenic acids (NAs) contained in energy-derived waters such as refinery effluents and process waters. If effective, fixed-film TiO2 photocatalysis of NAs could decrease operational expenses as well as capital costs for water treatment. The overall objective of this study was to measure rates and extents of photolysis and photocatalytic degradation of commercial NAs using bench-scale fixed-film TiO2 and confirm changes in NA concentrations using sensitive vertebrate (fish = Pimephales promelas) and invertebrate (Daphnia magna) species. Specific objectives were to (1) measure rates and extents of degradation of commercial (Fluka) NAs throughout an 8-h duration of natural sunlight ("photolysis") and natural sunlight in the presence of fixed-film TiO2 ("photocatalysis") and (2) measure changes in toxicity in terms of mortality with sentinel fish and microinvertebrate species. Bench-scale chambers using thin-film TiO2 irradiated with natural sunlight were used to measure photocatalysis, and HPLC was used to quantify NAs. After 4 h in photocatalysis treatments, > 92 % decline was observed with an average removal rate of 15.5 mg/L/h and half-life of 2 h. After 5 h of photocatalysis, there was no measurable NA toxicity for fish (P. promelas) or microinvertebrates (D. magna). Photocatalytic degradation achieved efficacious rates and extents of removal of Fluka NAs and eliminated acute toxicity to sentinel aquatic organisms, indicating the potential for application of this technology for mitigating ecological risks. Coupled with existing treatment processes (i.e., aerobic biodegradation), photocatalysis can augment rates and extents of NA removal from impacted waters.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0049-6979	1573-2932		WOS:000376276100003

Moreover, demand side management as an effective strategy can relieve the energy security and environmental issues. Thus, the residential customers as one of the major groups of the customers, should be incorporated in the UC and generation scheduling problems. In this study, implementation of demand response (DR) programs in the UC problem are modeled. Herein, the implemented DR programs are entitled nonlinear DR (NDR) programs because nonlinear behavioral models for the residential customers are considered. In addition, the value of cost correlated with the implementation of the NDR programs in the UC problem (UC-NDR) are modeled. It is demonstrated that cooperation of the residential customers in the UC-NDR problem can be beneficial in decreasing cost and greenhouse gas emissions of the thermal power plants. In addition, it is concluded that comprehensive studies are needed to realistically model the residential customers behavior, since the different behavioral models result in different solutions and outcomes for the UC-NDR problem.

Based on work within the Ecotoxicology Community of Research (2012-2015) the present Focus article provides an overview of the state of the art of nanomaterials (NMs) in the aquatic environment by addressing different research questions, with a focus on ecotoxicological test systems and the challenges faced when assessing NM hazards (e.g., uptake routes, bioaccumulation, toxicity, test protocols, and model organisms). The authors' recommendation is to place particular importance on studying the ecological effects of aged/weathered NMs, as-manufactured NMs, and NMs released from consumer products in addressing the following overarching research topics: 1) NM characterization and quantification in environmental and biological matrices; 2) NM transformation in the environment and consequences for bioavailability and toxicity; 3) alternative methods to assess exposure; 4) influence of exposure scenarios on bioavailability and toxicity; 5) development of more environmentally realistic bioassays; and 6) uptake, internal distribution, and depuration of NMs. Research addressing these key topics will reduce uncertainty in ecological risk assessment and support the sustainable development of nanotechnology.

Treatments were formulated to be isocaloric and provide 100% (REQ) or 129% (HP) of CP requirement. Treatments were limit-fed 78 +/- 12 d prepartum to calving. All cows were fed a common diet postpartum. Cow BW and BCS were recorded at initiation of treatments and within 48 h post-calving. Milk production was estimated via the weigh-suckle-weigh technique 69 +/- 11 d postpartum. Calf BW was measured at birth and at weaning (121 +/- 11 d of age). Progeny (n = 42) were weaned as a group and placed into a feedlot and fed a common finishing diet. Glucose and insulin concentrations were analyzed on a subset of progeny (12 per treatment) 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, and 240 min post-feeding, 2 d before slaughter (342 +/- 11 d of age). Treatment had no effect (P >= 0.22) on cow BW, BCS, milk production, and subsequent reproduction or progeny preweaning growth. Progeny finishing growth and marbling scores were not affected (P >= 0.24) by treatment, yet 12th rib fat thickness (P < 0.01), KPH (P <= 0.04), and YG (P = 0.01) were greater for progeny born to HP dams. Progeny born to HP dams had decreased (P. 0.01) glucose and insulin concentrations, and insulin to glucose ratios, indicating greater insulin sensitivity. Although feeding cows 129% of CP requirement during late gestation did not affect cow performance or progeny preweaning or finishing period growth; carcass adiposity was increased by maternal treatment.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0021-8812	1525-3163		WOS:000375783300027	27285701

Material Constitutive Models for Creep and Rupture of SiC/SiC Ceramic-Matrix Composites (CMCs) Under Multiaxial Loading								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				25	5			1697	1708		10.1007/s11665-016-2036-1			MAY 2016	2016	Material constitutive models for creep deformation and creep rupture of the SiC/SiC ceramic-matrix composites (CMCs) under general three-dimensional stress states have been developed and parameterized using one set of available experimental data for the effect of stress magnitude and temperature on the time-dependent creep deformation and rupture. To validate the models developed, another set of available experimental data was utilized for each model. The models were subsequently implemented in a user-material subroutine and coupled with a commercial finite element package in order to enable computational analysis of the performance and durability of CMC components used in high-temperature high-stress applications, such as those encountered in gas-turbine engines. In the last portion of the work, the problem of creep-controlled contact of a gas-turbine engine blade with the shroud is investigated computationally. It is assumed that the blade is made of the SiC/SiC CMC, and that the creep behavior of this material can be accounted for using the material constitutive models developed in the present work. The results clearly show that the blade-tip/shroud clearance decreases and ultimately becomes zero (the condition which must be avoided) as a function of time. In addition, the analysis revealed that if the blade is trimmed at its tip to enable additional creep deformation before blade-tip/shroud contact, creep-rupture conditions can develop in the region of the blade adjacent to its attachment to the high-rotational-speed hub.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1059-9495	1544-1024		WOS:000374577300002

Methods and Results We recruited 248 racially diverse, low-income, pregnant women receiving CenteringPregnancy (TM) group prenatal care (N = 124) or individual prenatal care (N = 124) to complete surveys in early pregnancy, late pregnancy, and early postpartum, with 84 % completing three surveys. Twenty-six percent of group and 31 % of individual care participants reported food insecurity in early pregnancy (p = 0.493). In multiple logistic regression models, women choosing group versus individual care were more likely to report food security in late pregnancy (0.85 vs. 0.66 average predicted probability, p < 0.001) and postpartum (0.89 vs. 0.78 average predicted probability, p = 0.049). Among initially food-insecure women, group participants were more likely to become food-secure in late pregnancy (0.67 vs. 0.35 individual care average predicted probability, p < 0.001) and postpartum (0.76 vs. 0.57 individual care average predicted probability, p = 0.052) in intention-to-treat models. Group participants were more likely to change perceptions on affording healthy foods and stretching food resources. Group compared to individual care participants with early pregnancy food insecurity demonstrated higher maternal-infant attachment scale scores (89.8 vs. 86.2 points for individual care, p = 0.032). Conclusions Group prenatal care provides health education and the opportunity for women to share experiences and knowledge, which may improve food security through increasing confidence and skills in managing household food resources. Health sector interventions can complement food assistance programs in addressing food insecurity during pregnancy.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1092-7875	1573-6628		WOS:000374593800011	26662280

Further, we compared responses of girls in all-girls classes to girls in coeducational classes and responses of boys in all-boys classes to boys in coeducational classes. Using the Mathematics Attitude Scale and the What Is Happening in This Class? questionnaire, we found no significant differences in student responses on any of the subscales or domains for any of the subgroups, except for Math as a Male Domain.

Religion and Non-traditional Families in the United States								SOCIOLOGY COMPASS				10	5			391	403		10.1111/soc4.12370			MAY 2016	2016	Family forms that have historically been considered nontraditional and even transgressive are becoming increasingly accepted in the United States, bringing the United States into greater conformity with other western nations. The United States is still unique, however, in that religion continues to play an exceptionally powerful role in shaping Americans' perceptions of and engagement in non-traditional families. Focusing our attention on same-sex and interracial families specifically, we consider the recent work on how religion serves to stimulate and justify opposition or (in a minority of instances) support for such families. We contend that studies typically limit their focus to the cognitive aspects (beliefs, ideologies, identities, schemas, salience, etc.) of religion, while often ignoring the influence of religion's more structural aspects in shaping Americans' relationship to non-traditional families. Given that religion impacts Americans' approaches to family formation at the micro, meso, and macro levels, we propose a more Durkheimian perspective on the topic, one that synthesizes social psychological and structural frameworks in future studies, thus allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of religion's evolving role in American family formation. We also call for more attention to how religion shapes the functioning of non-traditional families.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1751-9020			WOS:000375765500005

Gender Inequality Across the Academic Life Course								SOCIOLOGY COMPASS				10	5			404	416		10.1111/soc4.12372			MAY 2016	2016	Recent decades have witnessed increasing scholarly and public attention to the status of women in academia. Although women are now the majority of degree recipients and their share of initial academic appointments approximates their representation among degree recipients, substantial gender inequality persists. In this article, we review existing research on this topic, focusing on how gender inequality manifests and unfolds throughout the academic career life course, from graduate school experiences, through initial academic appointments, into the associate professor years, and, finally, to women's experiences as full professors and administrators. Throughout, we emphasize how institutionalized policies and subtle biases, rather than overt discrimination, perpetuate gender inequality. We conclude with suggested areas for future research.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1751-9020			WOS:000375765500006

Analysis of expression data of the family of DUF1644-containing genes indicated that they may regulate responses to abiotic stress in rice. Here we present our discovery of the role of OsSIDP366, a member of the DUF1644 gene family, in response to drought and salinity stresses in rice. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing OsSIDP366 showed enhanced drought and salinity tolerance and reduced water loss as compared to that in the control, whereas plants with downregulated OsSIDP366 expression levels using RNA interference (RNAi) were more sensitive to salinity and drought treatments. The sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA) treatment was not changed in OsSIDP366-overexpressing plants, and OsSIDP366 expression was not affected in ABA-deficient mutants. Subcellular localization analysis revealed that OsSIDP366 is presented in the cytoplasmic foci that colocalized with protein markers for both processing bodies (PBs) and stress granules (SGs) in rice protoplasts. Digital gene expression (DGE) profile analysis indicated that stress-related genes such as SNAC1, OsHAK5 and PRs were upregulated in OsSIDP366-overexpressing plants. These results suggest that OsSIDP366 may function as a regulator of the PBs/SGs and positively regulate salt and drought resistance in rice.									0	2	0	0	0	2			1672-9072	1744-7909		WOS:000375146800005	26172270

The fibers were electrospun from an aqueous solution containing sol-gel mullite precursor and nickel nitrate. These fibers were then heat treated in the reducing atmosphere between 550 degrees C and 750 degrees C to achieve fine-dis persed metallic Ni nanoparticles (NPs). After the Ni2+ was reduced to Ni NPs at 750 degrees C for 10 h, the fibers were then directly transformed to the mullite fibers at 1000 degrees C without the undesirable intermediate spinel phase. In many high-temperature applications, mullite is the desired phase than spinel. If not fully reduced, the Ni2+ cations induce early precipitation of spinel phase before mullite can be formed. This spinel phase was a solid solution between Al2NiO4 and Al-Si spinels, which later reacted with the residual silica and formed a mixture of mullite and spinel at 1400 degrees C. The formation of spinel phase was suppressed or fully eliminated with chemically reducing Ni2+ to metal NPs. The average size of nickel NPs within the fibers was similar to 20 nm, insensitive of the Ni concentration and reducing temperature. However, the Ni NPs on the fiber surface grew as large as similar to 80 nm due to fast surface diffusion. The magnetic nanocomposites exhibited ferromagnetism with saturation magnetization (M-s) close to pure nickel of the same nominal weight, but coercivity (H-c) much smaller than the bulk nickel, indicating the nature of bimodal magnetic nanoparticle distributions. The majority of small Ni NPs (similar to 20 nm) within the fibers exhibited superparamagnetism, while the minor portion of relatively large NPs (50-80 nm) showed ferromagnetism.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000374858500005

Unlike most continuum robots, the sections of these arms do not have (central) supporting flexible backbone, and are actuated by multiple variable length actuators. Because of the constraining nature of actuators, the continuum sections can bend and/or elongate (compress) depending on the elongation/contraction characteristics of the actuators being used. Continuum arms have a number of distinctive differences with respect to traditional rigid arms namely: smooth bending, high inherent compliance, and adaptive whole arm grasping. However, due to numerical instability and the complexity of curve parametric models, there are no spatial dynamic models for multisection continuum arms. This paper introduces novel spatial dynamics and applies these to variable length multisection continuum arms with any number of sections. An efficient recursive computational scheme for deriving the equations of motion is presented. This is applied in a general form based on structurally accurate and numerically well-posed modal kinematics that assumes circular arc deformation of continuum sections without torsion. It is shown that the proposed modal dynamics are highly scalable, producing efficient and accurate numerical results. The spatial dynamic simulation results are experimentally validated using a pneumatic muscle actuated multisection prototype continuum arm. For the first time this enables investigation of spatial dynamic effects in this class of continuum arms.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0278-3649	1741-3176		WOS:000374656500005

Progressive studies imply that abnormality in PHD2 function may be due to misfolding. Therefore, study of the PHD2 unfolding pathway paves the way for a better understanding of the influence of PHD2 mutations and cancer cell metabolites on the protein folding pathway. We study the unfolding of the PHD2 catalytic domain using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), fluorescence spectroscopy, and discrete molecular dynamics simulations (DMD). Using computational and experimental techniques, we find that PHD2 undergoes four transitions along the thermal unfolding pathway. To illustrate PHD2 unfolding events in atomic detail, we utilize DMD simulations. Analysis of computational results indicates an intermediate species in the PHD2 unfolding pathway that may enhance aggregation propensity, explaining mutation-independent PHD2 malfunction.

NTa was purified to homogeneity. By size exclusion chromatography and SDS-PAGE analysis, the enzyme was determined to be a homodimer with monomeric molecular mass of 89.0 kDa. The optimal temperature and pH of strain NTa agarase were 40 degrees C and 10.0, respectively. It exhibited striking stability across a wide pH range of 5.0-11.0. Agarase from Stenotrophomonas sp. NTa had a relatively good resistance against the detected inhibitors, detergents and urea denaturant. The K-m and V-max for agar were 11.3 mg/ml and 25.4 U/mg, respectively. Thin layer chromatography analysis, mass spectrometry, and enzyme assay using p-nitrophenyl-alpha/beta-D-galactopyranoside revealed that strain NTa agarase was a beta-agarase that degraded agarose into neoagarobiose, neoagarotetraose and neoagarohexaose as the predominant products, as well as a small amount of 3,6-anhydro-alpha-L-galactose. This is the first to present evidence of agarolytic activity in strain from genus Stenotrophomonas.

Each of these countermeasures relates to a different cognitive step involved in successful change detection.Background: To date, change blindness has been studied primarily in vision, but there is limited empirical evidence that the tactile modality may also be subject to this phenomenon. Change blindness raises concerns regarding the robustness of tactile and multimodal interfaces.Method: Three countermeasures to tactile change blindness were evaluated in the context of a highly demanding monitoring task. One countermeasure was proactive (alerting the participant to a possible change before it occurred) whereas the other two were adaptive (triggered after the change upon an observed miss). Performance and subjective data were collected.Results: Compared to the baseline condition, all countermeasures improved intramodal tactile change detection. Adaptive measures resulted in the highest detection rates, specifically when signal gradation was employed (i.e., when the intensity of the tactile signal was increased after a miss was observed).Conclusion: Adaptive displays can be used to counter the effects of change blindness and ensure that tactile information is reliably detected. Increasing the tactile intensity after a missed change appears most promising and was the preferred countermeasure.Application: The findings from this study can inform the design of interfaces employing the tactile modality to support monitoring and attention management in data-rich domains.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0018-7208	1547-8181		WOS:000373954900009	26826063

Though tides are sometimes regarded as low-frequency gravity waves, their polarization relations are hardly considered. We derive the polarization relationships of tides from the primitive equations for perturbations of a dissipation-less atmosphere. The vertical wind tide is found to relate directly to temperature tide, independent of tidal structure and geometric location. On the other hand, the relation between meridional wind tide and zonal wind tide is found to depend on the horizontal derivatives of the associated geopotential perturbation, thus depending on tidal structure and geometric location. Lidar observed tides at a local station (tidal period perturbations) in the midlatitude mesopause region (80-105 km) and the Climatological Tidal Model of the Thermosphere (CTMT) based on Hough Mode Extension (HME) technique at the lidar site, both of which include the effect of dissipation, are then compared. These tidal amplitudes and phases are employed to discuss the results and implications of the derived tidal wave polarization relations. The dominance of the migrating tide follows from the phase relationship between zonal and meridional wind tides. By comparing the observed and derived vertical wind tides, we reveal qualitatively the altitude dependence of tidal wave dissipation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In total, 2,570 B. cinerea isolates were collected from strawberry fields in the eastern United States across three seasons and their sensitivity to the SDHI materials boscalid, fluopyram, fluxapyroxad, and penthiopyrad was assessed. Assays were based on visual assessment of presence or absence of mycelial growth on media amended with discriminatory fungicide doses to distinguish sensitive from resistant isolates, respectively. Overall frequencies of isolates resistant to boscalid, fluopyram, fluxapyroxad, and penthiopyrad increased over the 3 years to 30.0, 1.0, 5.5, and 7.4%, respectively. Four resistance patterns, designated A, B, C, or D, were found. Pattern A isolates were resistant to boscalid with the allele H272R at locus sdhB; pattern B isolates were resistant to boscalid and penthiopyrad with the allele H272R or H272Y at locus sdhB; pattern C isolates were resistant to boscalid, fluxapyroxad, and penthiopyrad with the allele H272Y at locus sdhB; and pattern D isolates were resistant to boscalid, fluopyram, fluxapyroxad, and penthiopyrad with alleles P225F or N230I at locus sdhB. Isolates with alleles H272Y, N230I, or P225F were sensitive to a new SDHI, benzovindiflupyr, with mean effective dose that inhibits 50% of mycelial growth values of less than 0.5 mu.g/ml for each genotype, suggesting that this fungicide may be useful for resistance management. Our data show an increase of B. cinerea isolates resistant to SDHI fungicides over three consecutive production seasons. Resistance management practices must be implemented for the sustained efficacy of SDHI fungicides against gray mold of strawberry.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0191-2917	1943-7692		WOS:000373966100012

Hsein								Probabilistic analysis of responses of cantilever wall-supported excavations in sands considering vertical spatial variability								COMPUTERS AND GEOTECHNICS				75				182	191		10.1016/j.compgeo.2016.02.004			MAY 2016	2016	The influence of vertical spatial variability of sands on the excavation-induced lateral wall deflection and bending moment of excavations supported by cantilever retaining walls is investigated in this paper. Herein, the random finite element method (RFEM) is adopted to explicitly study the effect of one-dimensional spatial variability of internal friction angle of sands on the predicted wall and ground responses. The RFEM analysis consists of three components: (1) finite element method for analyzing lateral wall deflection and bending moment, (2) random field theory implemented with Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), and (3) statistical interpretation of MCS results through confidence intervals. This study reveals the importance of random field modeling in coping with the spatial variability of sands in the problem of supported excavations: (1) neglecting spatial variability of soil property will cause an overestimation of the variation in the predicted wall deflection and bending moment; (2) the estimated probability of failure based on a well-established serviceability limit state may be overestimated or underestimated depending on the chosen limiting lateral wall deflection. This study further investigates the effect of the number of MCS on the confidence intervals of the predicted statistics of the maximum lateral wall deflection and the maximum bending moment. The results also demonstrate that the confidence interval analysis of the predicted statistics of the maximum lateral wall deflection and the maximum bending moment provides a rational tool for interpreting the statistical data from RFEM.

Using the incidence of first-born twins as an instrument for fertility outcomes, I find that Chinese senior parents with more children receive more financial transfers and are more likely to co-reside with an adult child. They are also less likely to work past retirement age. The estimated effects are large, despite the evidence that adult children from larger families are less educated and earn significantly less. Interestingly, the effect of an increase in the number of children on old-age support does not depend on the child's gender. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we report a laboratory-scale aqueous process that demonstrates nanoscale control for the recovery of uranium from simulated used nuclear fuel (SIMFUEL). The selective, hydrogen peroxide induced oxidative dissolution of SIMFUEL material results in the rapid assembly of persistent uranyl peroxide nanocluster species that can be separated and recovered at moderate to high yield from other process-soluble constituents using sequestration-assisted ultrafiltration. Implementation of size-selective physical processes like filtration could results in an overall simplification of nuclear fuel cycle technology, improving the environmental consequences of nuclear energy and reducing costs of processing.

The material was subjected to highly saline and constant vapor pressure environments individually to understand the influence of chemistry in propagating the subcritical cracks. The failure behavior in chloride environment was compared against humid environment using the data extracted from Raman spectroscopy, the thermodynamic characteristics of the environment and the micro-sized pore concentrations. The implications of the subcritical crack growth were derived by plotting nu-K-I graphs for each of the samples to clearly distinguish between the effects of the surrounding mediums. The impulse to crack propagation was found to be resistive with variations in degree of crack growth alternating directly with the changes in porosity, surrounding atmosphere and defect density. The rate of energy dissipation and its hindrance at the crack tip were found to be a major player, among others, in reducing the crack propagation rate.

J	He, Wei; Chen, Meilian; Schlautman, Mark A.; Hur, Jin					Chen, Meilian/0000-0002-7876-353X			Dynamic exchanges between DOM and POM pools in coastal and inland aquatic ecosystems: A review								SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT				551				415	428		10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.02.031			MAY 1 2016	2016	Dynamic exchanges between dissolved organic matter (DOM) and particulate organic matter (POM) plays a critical role in organic carbon cycling in coastal and inland aquatic ecosystems, interactions with aquatic organisms, mobility and bioavailability of pollutants, among many other ecological and geochemical phenomena. Although DOM-POM exchange processes have been widely studied from different aspects, little to no effort has been made to date to provide a comprehensive, mechanistic, and micro-spatial schema for understanding various exchange processes occurring in different aquatic ecosystems in a unified way. The phenomena occurring between DOM and POM were explained here with the homogeneous and heterogeneous mechanisms. In the homogeneous mechanism, the participating components are only organic matter (OM) constituents themselves with aggregation and dissolution involved, whereas OM is associated with other components such as minerals and particulate colloids in the heterogeneous counterpart. Besides the generally concerned processes of aggregation/dissolution and adsorption/desorption, other ecological factors such as sunlight and organisms can also participate in DOM-POM exchanges through altering the chemical nature of OM. Despite the limitation of current analytical technologies, many unknown and/or unquantified processes need to be identified to unravel the complicated exchanges of OM between its dissolved and particulate states. Based on the review of several previous mathematical models, we proposed a unified conceptual model to describe all major dynamic exchange mechanisms on the basis of exergy theory. More knowledge of dynamic DOM-POM exchanges is warranted to overcome the potential problems arising from a simple division of OM into dissolved versus particulate states and to further develop more sophisticated mathematic models.

Knowledge of transmission hotspots is essential for targeted malaria control and elimination in this region. This study aimed to determine the dynamics of malaria transmission and possible existence of transmission hotspots on a microgeographical scale along the China-Myanmar border. Microscopically confirmed clinical malaria cases were recorded in five border villages through a recently established surveillance system between January 2011 and December 2014. A total of 424 clinical cases with confirmed spatial and temporal information were analyzed, of which 330 (77.8%) were Plasmodium vivax and 88 (20.8%) were Plasmodium falciparum, respectively. The P. vivax and P. falciparum case ratio increased dramatically from 2.2 in 2011 to 4.7 in 2014, demonstrating that P. vivax malaria has become the predominant parasite species. Clinical infections showed a strong bimodal seasonality. There were significant differences in monthly average incidence rates among the study villages with rates in a village in China being 3-8 folds lower than those in nearby villages in Myanmar. Spatial analysis revealed the presence of clinical malaria hotspots in four villages. This information on malaria seasonal dynamics and transmission hotspots should be harnessed for planning targeted control. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

J	Tang, Ke; Venayagamoorthy, Ganesh K.								Adaptive inter-area oscillation damping controller for multi-machine power systems								ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH				134				105	113		10.1016/j.epsr.2016.01.005			MAY 2016	2016	The interconnection of multiple generation units in a power system can lead to inter-area oscillations that generally occur under critical operating conditions. To damp these oscillations, supplementary control can be provided by a wide area control (WAC) system using remote measurements from the power system. Wide area controllers designed with traditional approaches are non-adaptive and thus their control policy may not be optimal to nonlinear operation conditions and disturbances. In this paper, the concept of an artificial immune system (AIS) is applied in the development of an innate and adaptive controller to handle known, unknown and random disturbances in a power system. Furthermore, with synchronous generator. coherency grouping, remote virtual generator measurements are used to generate supplementary control signals to a synchronous generator that is identified to have maximum controllability on a power system. Real-time simulation and frequency analysis results show the superior performance of AIS-based controller in damping inter-area oscillations for different power system conditions and disturbances.

J	Saraf, Parimal; Balasubramaniam, Karthikeyan; Hadidi, Ramtin; Makram, Elham								Design of a wide area damping controller based on partial right eigenstructure assignment								ELECTRIC POWER SYSTEMS RESEARCH				134				134	144		10.1016/j.epsr.2015.12.012			MAY 2016	2016	The paper demonstrates the application of partial right eigenstructure assignment for designing an output-feedback based wide area damping controller in a power system. The unique feature of the controller is that it utilizes the additional design freedom provided by right eigenvectors along with eigenvalue placement to improve the dynamic behaviour of the system. The fact that multi-input-multi output (MIMO) systems provide more design freedom than just manipulating the eigenvalues of the system has been exploited for controller design. Supplementary loops on two static VAR compensators (SVC) have been used utilized to achieve the damping of oscillations. The first part of the paper uses a quadratic optimization based formulation to design a controller for a nominal operating point of the system. The second part demonstrates the incorporation of time delay of feedback signals in controller design. This methodology makes the designed controller robust to uncertainty in communication latency of feedback signals. The feedback signal selection for the controller is based on an input/output controllability metric specific to output feedback. An algorithm explaining the framework and the results of its implementation on the IEEE 68 bus test system has been provided. The results show the effectiveness of the controller to damp oscillations and robustification of the damping of these oscillations to time delay uncertainties. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	El-Hawaz, Rabia; Tharayil, Nishanth; Bridges, William; Adelberg, Jeffrey								Mineral nutrition of Curcuma longa L. in bioreactors affects subsequent development of curcuminoids following transfer to the greenhouse								INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS				83				186	193		10.1016/j.indcrop.2015.11.063			MAY 2016	2016	This work examined the concentrations of the curcuminoids in Curcuma longa L. from an experimental array (response surface method using D-optimal selection of treatments) of greenhouse plants repeated in both high and low-input fertilizer treatments. Curcuminoids concentrations in dry rhizomes were analyzed by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. In vitro mineral concentrations (PO43-, Ca2+, Mg2+, and KNO3) and plant density significantly influenced the subsequent growth of turmeric plants in the greenhouse during a six-month growing season. In the high fertilizer treatments, the in vitro interaction of PO43- with Ca2+ and Mg2+ concentrations maximized curcumin and demethoxycurcumin concentrations in the rhizomes. The highest concentrations of curcumin and demethoxycurcumin were 154.7 +/- 4.1 mu g/g and 1258.9 +/- 58.8 mu g/g with 1.25 mM PO43-, 3 mM Ca2+, 1.5 mM Mg2+, and 60 mM KNO3 and with 18 or 11 buds/vessel respectively. Reducing KNO3 concentration to 20 mM at 1.5 mM Mg2+ and 9 mM Ca2+ maximized bisdemethoxycurcumin concentration to 25.0 +/- 2.6 mu g/g with 9 buds/vessel. The best induction media under the low-input fertilizer treatments had similar optimal set points for all three curcuminoids; curcumin, demethoxycurcumin, and bisdemethoxycurcumin concentrations were maximized to 201 +/- 26.8 mu g/g, 813 +/- 138 mu g/g, and 23.5 +/- 4.6 mu g/g respectively with 6 buds/vessel, 6.25 mM PO43-, 3 mM Ca2+, 1.5 mM Mg2+, and 60 mM KNO3. High plant density with moderate mineral concentrations in vitro increased curcumin/bisdemethoxycurcumin ratio to 17.5 +/- 1.7 under low-input fertilizer. In the high fertilizer treatments, maximum concentrations of each curcuminoid had distinct mineral requirements, but in the nutrient limited treatments, all curcuminoids had similar optima for mineral concentrations and plant density requirements. With low-fertilizer input, the low in vitro plant density was the primary factor to maximize the concentration of curcuminoids in the rhizomes. The multi-factor design sufficiently identified the interactive effects among varied minerals on curcuminoids concentrations. This approach allows a propagation laboratory to develop propagation stock best suited to secondary metabolite production in the end-user facility. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

These singularities fall into the category of the so-called exceptional points (EP's) studied in the context of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians describing open quantum systems. We also propose a generic formula in terms of the properties of the EP's to quantify the exact number of Majorana zero modes in a particular chiral topological superconducting phase, given the values of the parameters appearing in the Hamiltonian. This formula serves as an alternative to the familiar integer (Z) winding number invariant characterizing topological superconductor/superfluid phases in the chiral BDI class. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The method is based on the pyrolysis (1000 degrees C under a mixture of 95% Ar/5% H-2 for 1 h) of paper strips modified with a saturated solution of CuSO4 and yields to the formation of abundant CuNPs on the surface of carbonized cellulose fibers. The resulting substrates were characterized by a combination of scanning electron microscopy, EDX, Raman spectroscopy as well as electrical and electrochemical techniques. Their potential application, as working electrodes for non-enzymatic amperometric determination of glucose, was then demonstrated (linear response up to 3 mM and a sensitivity of 460 +/- 8 mu A cm(-2) mM(-1)). Besides being a simple and inexpensive process for the development of electrochemically-active substrates, this approach opens new possibilities for the in-situ synthesis of metallic nanoparticles without the traditional requirements of solutions and adjuvants.

J	Meena, Amanda H.; Arai, Yuji								Effects of common groundwater ions on chromate removal by magnetite: importance of chromate adsorption								GEOCHEMICAL TRANSACTIONS				17						1	10.1186/s12932-016-0033-9			APR 29 2016	2016	Background: Reductive precipitation of hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) with magnetite is a well-known Cr(VI) remediation method to improve water quality. The rapid (< a few hr) reduction of soluble Cr(VI) to insoluble Cr(III) species by Fe(II) in magnetite has been the primary focus of the Cr(VI) removal process in the past. However, the contribution of simultaneous Cr(VI) adsorption processes in aged magnetite has been largely ignored, leaving uncertainties in evaluating the application of in situ Cr remediation technologies for aqueous systems. In this study, effects of common groundwater ions (i.e., nitrate and sulfate) on Cr(VI) sorption to magnetite were investigated using batch geochemical experiments in conjunction with X-ray absorption spectroscopy.Results: In both nitrate and sulfate electrolytes, batch sorption experiments showed that Cr(VI) sorption decreases with increasing pH from 4 to 8. In this pH range, Cr(VI) sorption decreased with increasing ionic strength of sulfate from 0.01 to 0.1 M whereas nitrate concentrations did not alter the Cr(VI) sorption behavior. This indicates the background electrolyte specific Cr(VI) sorption process in magnetite. Under the same ionic strength, Cr(VI) removal in sulfate containing solutions was greater than that in nitrate solutions. This is because the oxidation of Fe(II) by nitrate is more thermodynamically favorable than by sulfate, leaving less reduction capacity of magnetite to reduce Cr(VI) in the nitrate media. X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis supports the macroscopic evidence that more than 75 % of total Cr on the magnetite surfaces was adsorbed Cr(VI) species after 48 h.Conclusion: This experimental geochemical study showed that the adsorption process of Cr(VI) anions was as important as the reductive precipitation of Cr(III) in describing the removal of Cr(VI) by magnetite, and these interfacial adsorption processes could be impacted by common groundwater ions like sulfate and nitrate. The results of this study highlight new information about the large quantity of adsorbed Cr(VI) surface complexes at the magnetite-water interface. It has implications for predicting the long-term stability of Cr at the magnetite-water interface.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1467-4866			WOS:000378472300001	27134569

The phase and morphological properties of the coatings were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) respectively. The SEM images showed that increasing the percentage of Ag dopant reduces the size of droplets formed during the deposition process. The corrosion protection behavior of the coated samples was evaluated using potentiodynamic polarization (PD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The corrosion test was performed in Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution and 0.9 wt% saline solution using three electrode electrochemical cell. The results showed that TCP coated magnesium exhibits a much superior stability and lower corrosion rate compared to bare Mg. It was observed that increasing the mass of the Ag dopant increases the corrosion protection, but 10% Ag doping in TCP reduces the corrosion protection behavior. In conclusion, we have developed TCP and TCP doped with 1%, 5% and 10% Ag coating with tunable corrosion protection efficiency. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Journal of interpersonal violence														2016-Apr-22	2016	This study examines differences in psychological adjustment in a sample of rural adolescents who have been exposed to family violence. Self-report questionnaires were administered to 580 adolescents and their primary caregivers. The results revealed that over two thirds of the study participants (68.8%) had been exposed to violence in their families. As hypothesized, cluster analysis identified several profiles among adolescents, distinguished by their psychological and emotional functioning: well adjusted (46.2%), moderately adjusted (44.3%), and struggling (9.5%). Discriminant function analysis confirmed the groupings and revealed that family functioning was among the most influential factors explaining adjustment differences. Multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs) further showed that adolescents from each of the three adjustment profiles reported significantly different levels of family social support, parental involvement, and perceived neighborhood safety. Overall, the results confirm heterogeneity of adolescent adaptation in the aftermath of family violence and provide insights into family and neighborhood factors that account for variability in adolescents' reactions to violence. Implications for future research and practical interventions are discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1552-6518		MEDLINE:27106255	27106255	
J	Huang, Jiayan; Shi, Lu								The effectiveness of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) for survivors of breast cancer: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial								TRIALS				17						209	10.1186/s13063-016-1335-z			APR 22 2016	2016	Background: After treatment completion, breast cancer (BC) survivors frequently experience residual symptoms of pain, fatigue, high levels of psychological stress, anxiety, depression, fear of recurrence, and metastasis. Post-treatment stress, in particular, can adversely affect health-related quality of life, which, in turn, induces onset or recurrence of chronic diseases. Effective interventions that target these psychological symptoms and their physiological consequences are needed, especially for economically disadvantaged patients. However, in China, few evidence-based intervention strategies have been established among BC survivors. This study will formally adapt, develop, and evaluate an intensive mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) intervention protocol to improve mental health, quality of life, and compliance with medication among Chinese BC survivors.Methods: A randomized, waitlist-controlled clinical trial will be conducted. Based on our power calculation, 418 BC survivors will be recruited from 10 low-income communities in Shanghai. All subjects will be randomly assigned either to the MBSR program or to a waitlisted usual care regimen that will offer the MBSR program after the completion of the other trial arm (after 6 months follow-up). Our 8-week MBSR intervention program will provide systematic training to promote stress reduction by self-regulating arousal to stress. Assessments will be made at baseline, 4 weeks (in the middle of the first MBSR intervention), 8 weeks (at the end of the first MBSR intervention), 6 months, and 12 months, and will include measures of psychological symptoms (depression, anxiety, and perceived stress), quality of life, and medication adherence. The expected outcome will be the improvement in psychological symptoms, quality of life, and medication compliance in the MBSR intervention group.Discussion: This study will help develop an affordable, self-care psychological intervention protocol to help Chinese BC survivors improve their quality of life, and could be helpful in further developing affordable disease management plans for patients of other chronic diseases.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1745-6215			WOS:000374516600001	27101823

Using 6 years of Fermi Large Area Telescope data, we find no evidence for ALPs and exclude couplings above 5 x 10(-12) GeV-1 for ALP masses 0.5 less than or similar to m(a) less than or similar to 5 neV at 95% confidence. The limits are competitive with the sensitivity of planned laboratory experiments, and, together with other bounds, strongly constrain the possibility that ALPs can reduce the gamma-ray opacity of the Universe.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0031-9007	1079-7114		WOS:000374559300002	27152783	
J	Chaudhary, Shima; Kusakabe, Ayako; Melgar, Juan Carlos								Phytophthora infection in flooded citrus trees reduces root hydraulic conductance more than under non-flooded condition								SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE				202				107	110		10.1016/j.scienta.2016.02.031			APR 20 2016	2016	Phythophthora infections in citrus trees may result in poor tree health. Infections are very common under wet conditions. However, the interaction of Phytophthora and flooding conditions has yet to be studied in citrus. In this study, Phytophthora was inoculated into the soil of potted grapefruit trees, and trees were either well-watered or flooded for six weeks; then, these trees were compared with trees without Phytophthora inoculation under the same irrigation regimes. Phytophthora reduced root hydraulic conductance in citrus even though the propagule count was very low when root hydraulic conductance was measured (at the end of the experiment). In the presence of flooding, Phytophthora significantly reduced root hydraulic conductance compared to non-flooded citrus trees inoculated with Phytophthora alone. Flooding reduced stomatal conductance and increased tree mortality more than Phytophthora, but Phytophthora decreased the number of leaves per tree and tended to decrease tree growth more than flooding.

Ozone gas generated by an inexpensive unit designed for household-use was used to oxidize a 2 X 10(-8) M Pu(IV) solution to predominantly Pu(VI) with some Pu(V) present. Over several days, the Pu(VI) in the solution reduced to Pu(V) without further reducing to Pu(IV). The reduction from Pu(VI) to Pu(V) could be accelerated by raising the pH of the solution, which led to an immediate conversion without substantial conversion to Pu(IV). The aqueous Pu was found to be stable as predominately Pu(V) for greater than one month from pH 3-7; however, at circumneutral pH, a sizable fraction of Pu was lost from solution by either precipitation or sorption to the vial walls. This method provides a fast means of preparing Pu(V) solutions for tracer concentration studies without numerous extraction or cleanup steps.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0003-2700	1520-6882		WOS:000374706000007	26976236

Nucleic acid-based therapy is a promising strategy to deliver bioactive molecules capable of promoting axonal regeneration. Branched polyethylenimine (bPEI: 25 kDa) is one of the most widely studied nonviral vectors, but its clinical application has been limited due to its cytotoxicity and low transfection efficiency in the presence of serum proteins. In this study, we synthesized cationic amphiphilic copolymers, poly (lactide-co-glycolide)-graft-polyethylenimine (PgP), by grafting low molecular weight PLGA (4 kDa) to bPEI (25 kDa) at approximately a 3:1 ratio as an efficient nonviral vector. We show that PgP micelle is capable of efficiently transfecting plasmid DNA (pDNA) and siRNA in the presence of 10% serum in neuroglioma (C6) cells, neuroblastoma (B35) cells, and primary E8 chick forebrain neurons (CFN) with pDNA transfection efficiencies of 58.8%, 75.1%, and 8.1%, respectively. We also show that PgP provides high-level transgene expression in the rat spinal cord in vivo that is substantially greater than that attained with bPEI. The combination of improved transfection and reduced cytotoxicity in vitro in the presence of serum and in vivo transfection of neural cells relative to conventional bPEI suggests that PgP may be a promising nonviral vector for therapeutic nucleic acid delivery for neural regeneration.Statement of SignificanceGene therapy is a promising strategy to overcome barriers to axonal regeneration in the injured central nervous system. Branched polyethylenimine (bPEI: 25 kDa) is one of the most widely studied nonviral vectors, but its clinical application has been limited due to cytotoxicity and low transfection efficiency in the presence of serum proteins. Here, we report cationic amphiphilic copolymers, poly (lactide-co-gly colide)-graft-polyethylenimine (PgP) that are capable of efficiently transfecting reporter genes and siRNA both in the presence of 10% serum in vitro and in the rat spinal cord in vivo. The combination of improved transfection and reduced cytotoxicity in the presence of serum as well as transfection of neural cells in vivo suggests PgP may be a promising nucleic acid carrier for CNS gene delivery.

This catalog was obtained using 80 months of data re-processed with Pass 8, the newest event-level analysis, which significantly improves the acceptance and angular resolution of the instrument. Most of the 2FHL sources at high Galactic latitude are blazars. Using detailed Monte Carlo simulations, we measure, for the first time, the source count distribution, dN= dS, of extragalactic.-ray sources at E > 50 GeV and find that it is compatible with a Euclidean distribution down to the lowest measured source flux in the 2FHL (8 x 10(-12) ph cm(-2) s(-1)). We employ a one-point photon fluctuation analysis to constrain the behavior of dN= dS below the source detection threshold. Overall, the source count distribution is constrained over three decades in flux and found compatible with a broken power law with a break flux, Sb, in the range [8 x 10-12; 1.5 x 10-11] ph cm(-2) s(-1) and power-law indices below and above the break of a 2. [1.60; 1.75] and a 1 +/- 2.49 +/- 0.12, respectively. Integration of dN= dS shows that point sources account for at least 86_16 -14 % of the total extragalactic gamma-ray background. The simple form of the derived source count distribution is consistent with a single population (i. e., blazars) dominating the source counts to the minimum flux explored by this analysis. We estimate the density of sources detectable in blind surveys that will be performed in the coming years by the Cherenkov Telescope Array.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0031-9007	1079-7114		WOS:000373984100003	27127954

Cambarus (Hiaticambarus) lentiginosus differs from C. longirostris, C. (Hiaticambarus) andersoni, and C. (Hiaticambarus) diupalma in aspects of carapace and chela morphology and pigmentation pattern. Cambarus (H.) lentiginosus possesses a median carina on the dorsal surface of the acumen of the rostrum, a distinctly enlarged tubercle near the base of the opposable surface of the dactyl, and a speckled pigmentation pattern over a light base color; these characters are lacking in other known Hiaticambarus species. The known range of the species is restricted to the Flint River watershed. Cambarus (H.) lentiginosus is considered Endangered using American Fisheries Society conservation categorization.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1175-5326	1175-5334		WOS:000375270200004	27394612

The cluster structure in melts of sulfonated polystyrene with Na+ and Mg2+ counterions are resolved and correlated with the dynamics on multiple length and time scales extracted from measurements of the dynamic structure factor and shear rheology. We find that as the morphology of the ionic clusters changes from ladderlike for Na+ to disordered structures for Mg2+, the dynamic structure factor is affected on the length scale corresponding to the ionic clusters. Rheology studies show that the viscosity for Mg2+ melts is higher than for Na+ ones for all shear rates, which is well correlated with the larger ionic clusters' size for the Mg2+ melts.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0031-9007	1079-7114		WOS:000373773200007	27127986

We have also studied the time evolution of the flux, finding a correlation with the solar activity. We have developed a full Monte Carlo simulation describing the interactions of cosmic rays with the lunar surface. The results of the present analysis can be explained in the framework of this model, where the production of gamma rays is due to the interactions of cosmic-ray proton and helium nuclei with the surface of the Moon. Finally, we have used our simulation to derive the cosmic-ray proton and helium spectra near Earth from the Moon gamma-ray data.									2	0	0	0	0	2			2470-0010	2470-0029		WOS:000373584900002		
J	Larson, Lincoln R.; Jennings, Viniece; Cloutier, Scott A.								Public Parks and Wellbeing in Urban Areas of the United States								PLOS ONE				11	4					e0153211	10.1371/journal.pone.0153211			APR 7 2016	2016	Sustainable development efforts in urban areas often focus on understanding and managing factors that influence all aspects of health and wellbeing. Research has shown that public parks and green space provide a variety of physical, psychological, and social benefits to urban residents, but few studies have examined the influence of parks on comprehensive measures of subjective wellbeing at the city level. Using 2014 data from 44 U.S. cities, we evaluated the relationship between urban park quantity, quality, and accessibility and aggregate self-reported scores on the Gallup-Healthways Wellbeing Index (WBI), which considers five different domains of wellbeing (e.g., physical, community, social, financial, and purpose). In addition to park-related variables, our best-fitting OLS regression models selected using an information theory approach controlled for a variety of other typical geographic and socio-demographic correlates of wellbeing. Park quantity (measured as the percentage of city area covered by public parks) was among the strongest predictors of overall wellbeing, and the strength of this relationship appeared to be driven by parks' contributions to physical and community wellbeing. Park quality (measured as per capita spending on parks) and accessibility (measured as the overall percentage of a city's population within 1/2 mile of parks) were also positively associated with wellbeing, though these relationships were not significant. Results suggest that expansive park networks are linked to multiple aspects of health and wellbeing in cities and positively impact urban quality of life.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1932-6203			WOS:000373608000102	27054887

Here, we report on the percolation mechanism and electro-capacitive transport pathways of mixed-platelet network of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO), two isostructural and isoelectronic 2DNs. The transport mechanism is explained in terms of electron hopping through isolated hBN defect traps between rGO (possibly via electron tunneling/hopping through "funneling" points). With optical bandgaps of 4.57 and 4.08 eV for the hBN-domains and 2.18 eV for the rGO domains, the network of hBN with rGO exhibits Poole-Frenkel emission-based transport with mean hopping gap of 1.12 nm (similar to hBN trilayer) and an activation barrier of similar to 5 +/- 0.7 meV. Further, hBN (1.7 pF) has a 6-fold lower capacitance than 1:1 hBN:rGO, which has a resistance 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of rGO (1.46 M Omega).

Unprecedented mechanical property improvement, by replacing graphene oxide with pristine graphene, is demonstrated in this work. Polyvinylpyrrolidone-stabilized graphene platelets are alternately deposited with poly(acrylic acid) using hydrogen bonding assisted LbL assembly. Transmission electron microscopy imaging and the Halpin-Tsai model are used to demonstrate, for the first time, that intact graphene can be processed from water to generate polymer nanocomposite thin films with simultaneous parallel-alignment, high packing density, and exfoliation. A multilayer thin film with only 3.9 vol% of highly exfoliated, and structurally intact graphene, increases the elastic modulus (E) of a polymer multilayer thin film by 322% (from 1.41 to 4.81 GPa), while maintaining visible light transmittance of approximate to 90%. This is one of the greatest improvements in elastic modulus ever reported for a graphene-filled polymer nanocomposite with a glassy (E > 1 GPa) matrix. The technique described here provides a powerful new tool to improve nanocomposite properties (mechanical, gas transport, etc.) that can be universally applied to a variety of polymer matrices and 2D nanoplatelets.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1616-301X	1616-3028		WOS:000373738000010

Suwanee River Humic Acid (SRHA) was also used to determine the effect of natural macromolecules on nHOF aggregation. An increase in electrolyte concentration resulted in electrical double-layer compression of the negatively charged fullerene clusters, and the nC(60)s and nHOFs alike displayed classical Derjaguin Landau Verwey Overbeek (DLVO) type interaction. The critical coagulation concentration (CCC) displayed a strong negative correlation with the carbon number in fullerenes and was estimated as 220, 150, 100, and 70 mM NaCl and 10, 12, 6, and 7.5 mM CaCl2 for nC(60), nC(70), nC(76), and nC(84), respectively. The aggregation mechanisiin. (i.e., van der Waals interaction domination) was enumerated via molecular dynamics simulation and modified DLVO model. The presence of SRHA. (2.5 mg TOC/L) profoundly influenced the aggregation behavior by stabilizing all fullerene clusters, even at a 100 mM NaCl concentration. The results from this study can be utilized to predict aggregation kinetics of nHOF clusters other than the ones studied here. The scaling factor for van der Waals interaction can also be used to model nHOF duster interaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000373655800032	26928084

Co-Targeting of JNK and HUNK in Resistant HER2-Positive Breast Cancer								PLOS ONE				11	4					e0153025	10.1371/journal.pone.0153025			APR 5 2016	2016	Strategies for successful primary treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer include use of the HER2 inhibitors trastuzumab or lapatinib in combination with standard chemotherapy. While successful, many patients develop resistance to these HER2 inhibitors indicating an unmet need. Consequently, current research efforts are geared toward understanding mechanisms of resistance and the signaling modalities that regulate these mechanisms. We have undertaken a study to examine whether signaling molecules downstream of epidermal growth factor receptor, which often act as compensatory signaling outlets to circumvent HER2 inhibition, can be co-targeted to overcome resistance. We identified JNK signaling as a potential area of intervention and now show that inhibiting JNK using the pan-JNK inhibitor, SP600125, is effective in the HER2-positive, resistant JIMT-1 xenograft mammary tumor model. We also investigate potential combination strategies to bolster the effects of JNK inhibition and find that co-targeting of JNK and the protein kinase HUNK can prohibit tumor growth of resistant HER2-positive mammary tumors in vivo.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1932-6203			WOS:000373599600061	27045589

The National Hurricane Center displays hurricane forecasts using a track forecast cone, depicting the expected track of the storm and the uncertainty in the forecast. Our goal was to test whether different graphical displays of a hurricane forecast containing uncertainty would influence a decision about storm characteristics. Participants viewed one of five different visualization types. Three varied the currently used forecast cone, one presented a track with no uncertainty, and one presented an ensemble of multiple possible hurricane tracks. Results show that individuals make different decisions using uncertainty visualizations with different visual properties, demonstrating that basic visual properties must be considered in visualization design and communication.					8th International Conference on Geographic Information Science (GIScience)8th International Conference on Geographic Information Science (GIScience)	SEP 24-26, 2014SEP 24-26, 2014		Vienna, AUSTRIAVienna, AUSTRIA	1	0	0	0	0	1			1387-5868	1542-7633		WOS:000372891100004

The fuzzy inference system is used to detect the level of overseer/understeer at the high level and a speed-adaptive activation module determines whether an active front steering, active rear steering, or active 4 wheel steering is suited to improve vehicle handling stability. The resulting model-free system is capable of minimizing the amount of model calibration during the vehicle stability control development process as well as improving vehicle performance and stability over a wide range of vehicle and road conditions. A simulation study will be presented that evaluates the proposed scheme and compares the effectiveness of active front steer (AFS) and active rear steer (ARS) in enhancing the vehicle performance. Both time and frequency domain results are presented.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1946-3995	1946-4002		WOS:000383619500043

The Next Ten Years: Strategic Vision of Water Resources for Nursery Producers								HORTTECHNOLOGY				26	2			121	132					APR 2016	2016	Nursery and greenhouse producers, research and extension faculty, and representatives from allied fields collaborated to formulate a renewed vision to address water issues affecting growers over the next 10 years. The authors maintained the original container irrigation perspective published in "Strategic vision of container nursery irrigation in the next ten years,'' yet broadened the perspective to include additional challenges that face nursery crop producers today and in the future. Water availability, quality, and related issues continue to garner widespread attention. Irrigation practices remain largely unchanged due to existing irrigation system infrastructure and minimal changes in state and federal regulations. Recent concerns over urbanization and population growth, increased climate variability, and advancements in state and federal regulations, including new groundwater withdrawal limitations, have provided an inducement for growers to adopt efficient and innovative practices. Information in support of the overarching issues and projected outcomes are discussed within.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1063-0198	1943-7714		WOS:000384983400002

Flow within a wedge occurs when a Carbopol solution is pulled horizontally by a moving conveyer belt through the wedge apex opening at different speeds. The upper side of the wedge is fixed at the exit by a pivot joint about which it could rotate. At the wedge entrance, a force gauge is placed so that it is pushing at the upper side of the wedge to keep it at a predetermined position (and thus at a predetermined inclination angle). The gauge measures the restraining force required to counteract the pressure buildup on the flowing Carbopol solution side and to keep the upper side of the wedge at its position. Visualization through the transparent vertical sides of the wedge was used to track seeding particles inside the solution to reconstruct the velocity profile and in particular to reveal plug flow regions characteristic of the yield stress liquids.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0035-4511	1435-1528		WOS:000373160800002

The atmospheric reanalysis is based on implementation of data assimilation in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) using the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) ensemble Kalman filter. The tidal variability in the WACCM+ DART reanalysis is compared to the observed variability in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) based on the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics Dynamics satellite Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (TIMED/SABER) observations, in the ionosphere based on Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) observations, and in the upper thermosphere (similar to 475 km) based on Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) neutral density observations. To obtain the short-term DE3 variability in the MLT and upper thermosphere, we apply the method of tidal deconvolution to the TIMED/SABER observations and consider the difference in the ascending and descending longitudinal wave number 4 structure in the GRACE observations. The results reveal that tidal amplitude changes of 5-10 K regularly occur on short timescales (similar to 10-20 days) in the MLT. Similar variability occurs in the WACCM+ DART reanalysis and TIMED/SABER observations, demonstrating that the short-term variability can be captured in whole atmosphere models that employ data assimilation and in observations by the technique of tidal deconvolution. The impact of the short-term DE3 variability in the MLT on the ionosphere and thermosphere is also clearly evident in the COSMIC and GRACE observations. Analysis of the troposphere forcing in WACCM+ DART and simulations of the Global Scale Wave Model (GSWM) show that the short-term DE3 variability in the MLT is not related to a single source; rather, it is due to a combination of changes in troposphere forcing, zonal mean atmosphere, and wave-wave interactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2169-9380	2169-9402		WOS:000379960300056

The Discrete Element Method (DEM) is well suited for this task. It allows the macroscopic behavior of an assembly of particles to be calculated from the contact forces generated between each particle. Particle rearrangement, a significant signature of powder materials, is explicitly taken into account. We show that DEM has demonstrated use and significant potential for understanding the link between defect formation and initial microstructure.

One or three p-i-n junctions filled the region between the front window and back reflector; semiconductor layers were made from mixtures of two different alloys of hydrogenated amorphous silicon; empirical relationships between the complex-valued relative optical permittivity and the bandgap were used; a transparent-conducting-oxide layer was attached to the front surface of the solar cell; and a metallic reflector, either flat or periodically corrugated, was attached to the back surface. First, frequency-domain Maxwell postulates were solved to determine the spatial absorption of photons and thus the generation of electron-hole pairs. The AM1.5G solar spectrum was taken to represent the incident solar flux. Second, drift-diffusion equations were solved for the steady-state electron and hole densities. Numerical results indicate that increasing the number of p-i-n junctions from one to three may increase the solar-cell efficiency by up to 14%. In the case of single p-i-n junction solar cells, our simulations indicate that efficiency may be increased by up to 17% by incorporating a periodically corrugated back reflector (as opposed to a flat back reflector) and by tailoring the bandgap profile in the i layer.

J	Stanescu, Tudor D.; Tewari, Sumanta								Spin Polarization of Majorana Zero Modes and Topological Quantum Phase Transition in Semiconductor Majorana Nanowires								JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN INSTITUTE OF SCIENCE				96	2			107	119					APR-JUN 2016	2016	A number of recent works have discussed the issue of spin polarization of a Majorana zero mode in condensed matter systems. Here we show that the spin polarization density of a Majorana zero mode, computed as an average of the spin operator over its wave function, is identically zero. A single non-degenerate Majorana zero mode, therefore, does not couple to an applied magnetic field, except via hybridization with higher energy excited states (if present), which may perturb its wave function. If spin is defined by considering only the particle components of the wave function, as has been done in some recent works, Majorana zero modes do have a non-zero spatial profile of this quantity, which is measurable in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments. However, if such a quantity is measured in spin-resolved tunneling experiments (without spatial resolution), we show that it cannot be used as a unique signature of Majorana zero modes in the topologically non-trivial phase. As a byproduct, we show that in spatially inhomogeneous systems (specifically, in systems with a soft boundary), accidental zero energy modes (which for all practical purposes behave as Majorana zero modes) can appear with increasing magnetic field even in the absence of a topological quantum phase transition (TQPT). But only after gap closing and the associated TQPT, the modes are localized near the system edges, resulting in the maximum topological protection. In light of these considerations, demonstrating the nonlocal character of the topologically protected Majorana pair and its emergence after the systems undergo a TQPT, become critical tasks for the ongoing experimental search for Majorana bound states in condensed matter systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0970-4140			WOS:000378888500004

Job Satisfaction in Agile Development Teams: Agile Development as Work Redesign								JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS				17	4			267	307					APR 2016	2016	Agile software-development advocates claim that an important value proposition of agile methods is that they make people more motivated and satisfied with their jobs. While several studies present anecdotal evidence that agile methods increase motivation and satisfaction, research has not theoretically explained or empirically examined how agile development practices relate to team members' feelings about their work. Drawing on the management and software-development literature, we articulate a model of job design that connects agile development practices to perceptions of job characteristics and, thereby, improve agile team members' job satisfaction. Using data collected from 252 software-development professionals, we tested the model and found a positive relationship between agile project-management and software-development practices and employees' perceptions of job characteristics. Further, we found direct effects between agile development-practice use and job satisfaction. Finally, we found interaction effects between the use of agile project-management and software-development approaches and the perception of job autonomy. With this study, we contribute to the literature by theoretically explaining and directly evaluating agile development practices' impact on individuals' perceptions about their job characteristics and on their job satisfaction.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1536-9323	1558-3457		WOS:000378143100002

The other half of the melamine molecule is generated by a twofold axis. 5FC molecules A and B are linked through two different homosynthons [R-2(2) (8) ring motif]; one is formed via a pair of N-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonds and the second via a pair of N-H center dot center dot center dot N hydrogen bonds. In addition to this pairing, the O atoms of 5FC molecules A and B interact with the N2 amino group on both sides of the melamine molecule, forming a DDAA array of quadruple hydrogen bonds and generating a supramolecular pattern.

Frameworks for organising design performance metrics								JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING DESIGN				27	4-6			175	204		10.1080/09544828.2015.1135235			APR-JUN 2016	2016	Computational tools for aiding design-by-analogy have focused on function-flow and keyword-based retrieval of analogues. Because of the critical role of performance and benchmarking in design, the need for performance metrics-driven analogy retrieval is currently unmet. Towards meeting this need, a study has been done to investigate and propose a combined framework for organising the myriad of technical performance metrics used in engineering design (e.g. efficiency, cost, weight, etc.). Such organisational frameworks are needed for the implementation of a computational tool which can retrieve relevant analogies using performance metrics. The study, which takes a deductive approach, defines a hierarchical taxonomy of performance metrics akin to the Functional Basis vocabulary of function and flow terms. To support this approach, an empirical study was conducted to verify the identification of criticality with use in analogy designs.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0954-4828	1466-1837		WOS:000377633500001

In distributed design-manufacturing enterprises, there exists a need to: (1) establish and use "best practice" assembly process descriptions to ensure process design consistency across manufacturing locations and (2) leverage and adapt existing process design knowledge across product lines. In this research, the need for better communication is addressed by design knowledge reuse. Specifically, previously-authored assembly processes are retrieved from a centralized repository with a text-based similarity and retrieval algorithm. The similarity of forty-five text-based assembly work instruction pairs (obtained from ten work instruction sets) is computed using four text mining algorithms: (1) Word Overlap, (2) Jaccard Score, (3) TF-IDF and (4) Latent Semantic Analysis. The similarity scores are used to compare and retrieve similar work instructions from a repository of existing assembly processes descriptions. A survey is conducted to develop a baseline quantification of assembly work instruction similarity. The scores from each text comparison method are compared to the scores from the survey. A statistical hypothesis test shows the Jaccard method mimics human interpretation of assembly work instruction similarity better than the three other text comparison methods. However, the Jaccard method is insensitive to synonymy and polysemy of words. The Latent Semantic Analysis method is relatively insensitive to synonymy and polysemy of words; and was found to have a difference of 0.1 with respect to survey data.

J	Lazar, Kelly B.; Polyak, Leonid; Dipre, Geoffrey R.								RE-EXAMINATION OF THE USE OF CASSIDULINA NEOTERETIS AS A PLEISTOCENE BIOSTRATIGRAPHIC MARKER IN THE ARCTIC OCEAN								JOURNAL OF FORAMINIFERAL RESEARCH				46	2			115	123					APR 2016	2016	Foraminiferal tests from two sediment cores from the western Arctic Ocean were investigated for evidence of an evolutionary transition from Cassidulina teretis Tappan to Cassidulina neoteretis Seidenkrantz during the Pleistocene. Previous results based on core material from the North Atlantic and the Nordic Seas suggested minute differences between these test types and resulted in the emendation of C. neoteretis, as well as its designation as a Pleistocene biostratigraphic marker. This study identifies both species throughout most of the western Arctic foraminiferal record, without a clear pattern of evolution from one to another, except for the uppermost part of the stratigraphy (late Pleistocene). These results indicate that the C. teretisIC. neoteretis transition was more time-transgressive than previously believed and that these foraminifers may be ecophenotypes rather than different species. The stratigraphic use of C. neoteretis is likely to be site-specific and caution should be taken in its application across the entire Polar region.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0096-1191			WOS:000375175700003		
J	Roser, Philipp								An extension of cosmological dynamics with York time								GENERAL RELATIVITY AND GRAVITATION				48	4					42	10.1007/s10714-016-2037-2			APR 2016	2016	It has been suggested that the York parameter T (effectively the scalar extrinsic curvature of a spatial hypersurface) may play the role of a fundamental time parameter. In a flat, forever expanding cosmology the York parameter remains always negative, taking values T = -infinity at the big bang and approaching some finite nonpositive value as t ->infinity, t being the usual cosmological time coordinate. Based on previous results concerning a simple, spatially flat cosmological model with a scalar field, we provide a temporal extension of this model to include 'times' T > 0, an epoch not covered by the cosmological time coordinate t, and discuss the dynamics of this 'other side' and its significance. We argue that the extension is necessary if a consistent quantisation scheme is to exist. Furthermore, we investigate which types of potentials lead to smooth transitions, paying particular attention to currently favoured inflaton potentials.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0001-7701	1572-9532		WOS:000372305200006

Pareto-based negotiation in distributed multidisciplinary design								STRUCTURAL AND MULTIDISCIPLINARY OPTIMIZATION				53	4			657	671		10.1007/s00158-015-1348-3			APR 2016	2016	The process of distributed engineering design calls for a methodology making use of the most recent advances in optimization-based design including multidisciplinary and multiobjective optimization. In distributed design, the participating teams do not have access to the design problems of other teams but may exchange limited information about their own current designs, making negotiation among themselves a key mechanism to reach a desired compromise which, nevertheless, is also a Pareto design to the original problem. A mathematical model of this distributed but decomposable design process is posed and solved using Lagrangian relaxation, while Pareto optimality is equivalently converted to single-objective optimality by means of multicriteria decision making strategies. The proposed coordination algorithm allows negotiation among the teams (subproblems) by sharing only limited information that is restricted to values of optimization quantities. The proposed modeling and solution scheme is applied to a numerical example representing the design of vehicle subsystems and components.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1615-147X	1615-1488		WOS:000373023800002

We address this limitation by adapting the CRISPR-Cas9 system from Streptococcus pyogenes for markerless gene disruption and integration in Y. lipolytica. Single gene disruption efficiencies of 92% and higher were achieved when single guide RNAs (sgRNA) were transcribed with synthetic hybrid promoters that combine native RNA polymerase 111 (Pol III) promoters with tRNA. The Pol III-tRNA hybrid promoters exploit endogenous tRNA processing to produce mature sgRNA for Cas9 targeting. The highest efficiencies were achieved with a SCR1'-tRNA(GIY) promoter and Y. lipolytica codon-optimized Cas9 expressed from a UAS1B8-TEF promoter. Cotransformation of the Cas9 and sgRNA expressing plasmid with a homologous recombination donor plasmid resulted in markerless homologous recombination efficiency of over 64%. Homologous recombination was observed in 100% of transformants when nonhomologous end joining was disrupted. The end result of these studies was the development of pCRISPRyl, a modular tool for markerless gene disruption and integration in Y. lipolytica.									4	0	0	3	0	4			2161-5063			WOS:000374436400009	26714206

The concept of embodiment (the dynamic coupling between sensory-motor control, anatomy, materials and environment that allows for the animal to achieve adaptive behaviours) is used as a starting point for the design process but tempered by current engineering technologies and approaches. In this article, the embodied design requirements are first discussed from a robotic viewpoint by taking into account real-life engineering limitations; then, the motor control schemes inspired by octopus nervous system are investigated. Finally, the mechanical and control design of a prototype is presented that appropriately blends bio-inspiration and engineering limitations. Simulated and experimental results show that the developed continuum robotic arm is able to reproduce octopus-like motions for bending, reaching and grasping.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1687-8132	1687-8140		WOS:000375583100029

Silvicultural treatments for converting loblolly pine to longleaf pine dominance: effects on ground layer and midstorey vegetation								APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE				19	2			280	290		10.1111/avsc.12217			APR 2016	2016	Questions: How do management practices used to enhance longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) seedling survival and growth under a loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) canopy alter the structure of midstorey and ground layer vegetation? Do management treatments achieve general restoration targets for longleaf pine ecosystem structure?Location: Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, NC, USA within the Middle Atlantic Coastal Plain Ecoregion.Methods: Four levels of timber harvest were applied to loblolly pine stands: Control (uncut, basal area similar to 16.2 m(2).ha(-1)), MedBA (residual basal area similar to 9.0 m(2).ha(-1)), LowBA (residual basal area similar to 6.4 m(2).ha(-1)) and Clearcut (residual basal area of 0 m(2).ha(-1)). Within each canopy treatment, we applied three cultural treatments selected to facilitate longleaf pine seedling success: NT (untreated), H (chemical control of woody vegetation) and H + F (chemical control plus fertilization). Vegetation responses, including the abundance (cover) of ground layer vegetation and midstorey stem densities, were reported for three growing seasons (2008-2010) following canopy removal.Results: The ground layer was dominated by woody vegetation, and total vegetation cover generally increased with increasing canopy removal. Canopy treatment effects varied through time. Clearcut plots had higher total herbaceous and graminoid cover than MedBA and Control plots in 2008, while woody cover was significantly lower on Control plots than on LowBA and Clearcut plots in 2009. Clearcut plots had higher densities of loblolly pines than Control plots in 2009 and 2010. The herbicide treatment reduced hardwood densities, but increased loblolly pine densities, especially in 2010.Conclusions: Successful restoration prescriptions are often site-specific because of different land-use history, climate, site characteristics and starting conditions. To achieve the restoration objective of creating an open midstorey with an herbaceous-dominated ground layer when converting loblolly pine stands to longleaf pine dominance on relatively productive sites with abundant hard woods and aggressive loblolly pine natural regeneration, canopy retention can slow the rate of development of loblolly pine regeneration and herbicides reduce hardwood stem densities. Frequent, repeated burning would likely be required to further reduce woody vegetation and increase the relative abundance of herbaceous vegetation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1402-2001	1654-109X		WOS:000374545600012

X7R and NP0 MLC capacitors with a 50 V voltage rating and 0603 package size were tested. X7R capacitors often failed during a spike in the voltage, but exhibited no obvious degradation in the measured insulation resistance at low voltages immediately after the failure. NP0 capacitors usually failed by suddenly shorting and maintaining the short after the failure. With the application of additional voltage spikes, some X7R capacitors exhibited a full recovery in terms of the measured resistance, returning to their initial state. The resistance of an X7R capacitor damaged by an EFT event is a function of the applied voltage. The terminal impedance can be modeled as two diodes in parallel.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2156-3950	2156-3985		WOS:000374551500007		
J	Getov, Ivan; Petukh, Marharyta; Alexov, Emil								SAAFEC: Predicting the Effect of Single Point Mutations on Protein Folding Free Energy Using a Knowledge-Modified MM/PBSA Approach								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES				17	4					512	10.3390/ijms17040512			APR 2016	2016	Folding free energy is an important biophysical characteristic of proteins that reflects the overall stability of the 3D structure of macromolecules. Changes in the amino acid sequence, naturally occurring or made in vitro, may affect the stability of the corresponding protein and thus could be associated with disease. Several approaches that predict the changes of the folding free energy caused by mutations have been proposed, but there is no method that is clearly superior to the others. The optimal goal is not only to accurately predict the folding free energy changes, but also to characterize the structural changes induced by mutations and the physical nature of the predicted folding free energy changes. Here we report a new method to predict the Single Amino Acid Folding free Energy Changes (SAAFEC) based on a knowledge-modified Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann (MM/PBSA) approach. The method is comprised of two main components: a MM/PBSA component and a set of knowledge based terms delivered from a statistical study of the biophysical characteristics of proteins. The predictor utilizes a multiple linear regression model with weighted coefficients of various terms optimized against a set of experimental data. The aforementioned approach yields a correlation coefficient of 0.65 when benchmarked against 983 cases from 42 proteins in the ProTherm database.

J	Petukh, Marharyta; Dai, Luogeng; Alexov, Emil								SAAMBE: Webserver to Predict the Charge of Binding Free Energy Caused by Amino Acids Mutations								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES				17	4					547	10.3390/ijms17040547			APR 2016	2016	Predicting the effect of amino acid substitutions on protein-protein affinity (typically evaluated via the change of protein binding free energy) is important for both understanding the disease-causing mechanism of missense mutations and guiding protein engineering. In addition, researchers are also interested in understanding which energy components are mostly affected by the mutation and how the mutation affects the overall structure of the corresponding protein. Here we report a webserver, the Single Amino Acid Mutation based change in Binding free Energy (SAAMBE) webserver, which addresses the demand for tools for predicting the change of protein binding free energy. SAAMBE is an easy to use webserver, which only requires that a coordinate file be inputted and the user is provided with various, but easy to navigate, options. The user specifies the mutation position, wild type residue and type of mutation to be made. The server predicts the binding free energy change, the changes of the corresponding energy components and provides the energy minimized 3D structure of the wild type and mutant proteins for download. The SAAMBE protocol performance was tested by benchmarking the predictions against over 1300 experimentally determined changes of binding free energy and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.62 was obtained. How the predictions can be used for discriminating disease-causing from harmless mutations is discussed.

J	Greene, Daniel								The wealth of private firm owners following reverse mergers								JOURNAL OF CORPORATE FINANCE				37				56	75		10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2015.12.002			APR 2016	2016	I compare the wealth of private firm owners that exit their firms through reverse mergers (RMs) to the wealth that could have been obtained in initial public offerings (IPOs), sellouts, or by remaining private. Private firm owners that use the RM exit mechanism have significantly less post-exit wealth than the wealth that could have been obtained in an IPO. This result is driven by differences in the pre-exit characteristics of firms that choose a RM compared to an IPO (a selection effect), not by use of the RM exit mechanism itself (a treatment effect). The gap between post-exit wealth and the wealth that could have been obtained in an IPO disappears for owners of RM firms whose pre-exit characteristics are sufficiently similar to propensity-score matched IPO firms. The post-exit wealth of RM firm owners is approximately the same as the wealth that could have been obtained in a sellout. The median change in private firm owner wealth as a result of the RM is positive when pre-exit private firm values are inferred from valuations in private private takeovers. However, the median change in wealth is negative when pre-exit private firm values are obtained from valuations provided in fairness opinions. These conflicting findings appear to be driven by upwardly biased fairness opinion valuations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Measuring Undergraduate Students' Engineering Self-Efficacy: A Validation Study								JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION				105	2			366	395		10.1002/jee.20121			APR 2016	2016	Background Self-efficacy has been shown to be positively related to undergraduate engineering students' achievement. Designing self-efficacy measures to assess the multifaceted skills required of engineers could improve the predictive relationship between efficacy beliefs and performance.Purpose This study evaluates the factor structure, validity, and reliability of general and skill-specific engineering self-efficacy measures created for use with undergraduate engineering students.Design/Method Self-efficacy items used for the measures were created and adapted from those used previously. Survey responses were collected from engineering students attending two southeastern universities. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used to determine factor structure. Multiple regression analyses examined the relationship between engineering self-efficacy and academic achievement and intent to persist in engineering, both uniquely and when considering other motivation variables.Results Factor analysis results suggested two self-efficacy scales. The General Engineering Self-Efficacy Scale is unidimensional; the Engineering Skills Self-Efficacy Scale is multidimensional with three factors representing experimental skills, tinkering skills, and design. General engineering self-efficacy predicted academic achievement, even when prior achievement was controlled. Students' intrinsic value in engineering predicted their intentions to persist in the engineering profession.Conclusions We found evidence for the reliability, validity, and predictive utility of the engineering self-efficacy scales. These scales can be used to assess undergraduate students' beliefs in their capabilities to perform tasks in their coursework and future roles as engineers and to investigate the association between self-efficacy and academic outcomes of interest.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1069-4730	2168-9830		WOS:000374644700007

It tests this proposal with agent network measures rather than with more traditional variables. We examine three such network dynamics that, according to the collective perspectives of complexity theory, influence a network's capacity to perform: informal leadership, interaction among agents, and clique engagement. Data were collected at an elementary school in the southeastern United States; the methodologies include qualitative interviews, network analysis, and response surface methods. Results revealed that informal leadership and engagement in cliques positively affect the productive capacity of organizations, and that cliques can absorb large amounts of information flow (volatility) thus promoting stable productivity levels. That is, collective, information-processing adaptability fosters stable productivity plateaus that absorb unpredictable demands. Suggestions for practitioners are provided. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

J	Clayton, Donald D.; Meyer, Bradley S.								The secondary supernova machine: Gravitational compression, stored Coulomb energy, and SNII displays								NEW ASTRONOMY REVIEWS				71				1	8		10.1016/j.newar.2016.03.002			APR 2016	2016	Radioactive power for several delayed optical displays of core-collapse supernovae is commonly described as having been provided by decays of Ni-56 nuclei. This review analyses the provenance of that energy more deeply: the form in which that energy is stored; what mechanical work causes its storage; what conservation laws demand that it be stored; and why its release is fortuitously delayed for about 10(6) s into a greatly expanded supernova envelope. We call the unifying picture of those energy transfers the secondary supernova machine owing to its machine-like properties; namely, mechanical work forces storage of large increases of nuclear Coulomb energy, a positive energy component within new nuclei synthesized by the secondary machine. That positive-energy increase occurs despite the fusion decreasing negative total energy within nuclei. The excess of the Coulomb energy can later be radiated, accounting for the intense radioactivity in supernovae. Detailed familiarity with this machine is the focus of this review. The stored positive-energy component created by the machine will not be reduced until roughly 10(6) s later by radioactive emissions (EC and beta+) owing to the slowness of weak decays. The delayed energy provided by the secondary supernova machine is a few x 10(49) erg, much smaller than the one percent of the 10(53) erg collapse that causes the prompt ejection of matter; however, that relatively small stored energy is vital for activation of the late displays. The conceptual basis of the secondary supernova machine provides a new framework for understanding the energy source for late SNII displays. We demonstrate the nuclear dynamics with nuclear network abundance calculations, with a model of sudden compression and reexpansion of the nuclear gas, and with nuclear energy decompositions of a nuclear mass law. These tools identify excess Coulomb energy, a positive-energy component of the total negative nuclear energy, as the late activation energy. If the value of fundamental charge e were smaller, SNII would not be so profoundly radioactive. Excess Coulomb energy has been carried within nuclei radially for roughly 10(9) km before being radiated into greatly expanded supernova remnants. The Coulomb force claims heretofore unacknowledged significance for supernova physics. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1387-6473	1872-9630		WOS:000375822400001		
J	Chandrasekharan, N.; Thompson, L. L.								Increased power to weight ratio of piezoelectric energy harvesters through integration of cellular honeycomb structures								SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES				25	4					045019	10.1088/0964-1726/25/4/045019			APR 2016	2016	The limitations posed by batteries have compelled the need to investigate energy harvesting methods to power small electronic devices that require very low operational power. Vibration based energy harvesting methods with piezoelectric transduction in particular has been shown to possess potential towards energy harvesters replacing batteries. Current piezoelectric energy harvesters exhibit considerably lower power to weight ratio or specific power when compared to batteries the harvesters seek to replace. To attain the goal of battery-less self-sustainable device operation the power to weight ratio gap between piezoelectric energy harvesters and batteries need to be bridged. In this paper the potential of integrating lightweight honeycomb structures with existing piezoelectric device configurations (bimorph) towards achieving higher specific power is investigated. It is shown in this study that at low excitation frequency ranges, replacing the solid continuous substrate of conventional bimorph with honeycomb structures of the same material results in a significant increase in power to weight ratio of the piezoelectric harvester. At higher driving frequency ranges it is shown that unlike the traditional piezoelectric bimorph with solid continuous substrate, the honeycomb substrate bimorph can preserve optimum global design parameters through manipulation of honeycomb unit cell parameters. Increased operating lifetime and design flexibility of the honeycomb core piezoelectric bimorph is demonstrated as unit cell parameters of the honeycomb structures can be manipulated to alter mass and stiffness properties of the substrate, resulting in unit cell parameter significantly influencing power generation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0964-1726	1361-665X		WOS:000375575400021

During the past decade, significant progress has been made in developing soluble factors (e.g., small molecules and growth factors) to direct stem cells into a desired phenotype. However, the current lack of suitable synthetic materials to regulate stem cell activity has limited the realization of the enormous potential of stem cells. This can be attributed to a large number of materials properties (e.g., chemical structures and physical properties of materials) that can affect stem cell fate. This makes it challenging to design biomaterials to direct stem cell behavior. To address this, polymer microarray technology has been developed to rapidly identify materials for a variety of stem cell applications. In this article, we summarize recent developments in polymer array technology and their applications in stem cell engineering.Statement of significanceStem cells hold remarkable promise for applications in tissue engineering and disease modeling.

LOWER BOUNDS ON THE ROMAN AND INDEPENDENT ROMAN DOMINATION NUMBERS								APPLICABLE ANALYSIS AND DISCRETE MATHEMATICS				10	1			65	72		10.2298/AADM151112023C			APR 2016	2016	A Roman dominating function (RDF) on a graph G is a function f : V(G) -> {0, 1, 2} satisfying the condition that every vertex u with f(u) = 0 is adjacent to at least one vertex v of G for which f(v) = 2. The weight of a Roman dominating function is the sum f(V) = Sigma(v is an element of V) f(v), and the minimum weight of a Roman dominating function f is the Roman domination number gamma(R)(G). An RDF f is called an independent Roman dominating function (IRDF) if the set of vertices assigned positive values under f is independent. The independent Roman domination number i(R)(G) is the minimum weight of an IRDF on G. We show that for every nontrivial connected graph G with maximum degree Delta, gamma(R)(G) >= Delta + 1/Delta gamma(G) and i(R)(G) >= i(G) + gamma(G)/Delta, where gamma(G) and i(G) are, respectively, the domination and independent domination numbers of G.

Conventional point-source and extended-source studies rely on the modeling of this diffuse emission for accurate characterization. Here, we describe the development of the Galactic Interstellar Emission Model (GIEM), which is the standard adopted by the LAT Collaboration and is publicly available. This model is based on a linear combination of maps for interstellar gas column density in Galactocentric annuli and for the inverse-Compton emission produced in the Galaxy. In the GIEM, we also include large-scale structures like Loop. I and the Fermi bubbles. The measured gas emissivity spectra confirm that the cosmic-ray proton density decreases with Galactocentric distance beyond 5 kpc from the Galactic Center. The measurements also suggest a softening of the proton spectrum with Galactocentric distance. We observe that the Fermi bubbles have boundaries with a shape similar to a catenary at latitudes below 20 degrees and we observe an enhanced emission toward their base extending in the north and south Galactic directions and located within similar to 4 degrees of the Galactic Center.									18	0	0	0	0	18			0067-0049	1538-4365		WOS:000375304600008

Extracellular vesicles that shuttle RNA, proteins, and lipids from donor cells to recipient cells are candidates for mediating connectivity in the brain. Despite the abundance of extracellular vesicles during brain development, evidence for their physiological functions is only beginning to materialize.

A DIETARY STUDY OF THE ROUGH-FOOTED MUD TURTLE (KINOSTERNON HIRTIPES) IN TEXAS, USA								HERPETOLOGICAL CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY				11	1			142	+					APR 2016	2016	We conducted a dietary study of the Rough-footed Mud Turtle (Kinosternon hirtipes) at Plata Wetland Complex (PWC) in Presidio County, Texas, USA, from 2007-2008. We collected feces from 88 turtles, including 42 males, 14 females, and 32 juveniles. Items recovered from fecal samples included filamentous algae, vegetation, seeds and fruits, aquatic, terrestrial, and flying arthropods, and aquatic gastropods. Based on percent occurrence (number of samples in which a particular dietary item occurs divided by the sample size), vegetation and insects were the principal foods consumed. Lesser amounts of filamentous algae, seeds and fruits, and aquatic gastropods were recovered from feces. Kinosternon hirtipes at PWC appear to be generalist omnivores. The remains of terrestrial arthropods in feces suggest some foraging activity occurs terrestrially or at the land-water interface. Kinosternon hirtipes undergoes an ontogenetic dietary shift from insects to vegetation as body size increases, which presumably facilitates rapid growth and minimizes the time an individual remains at a size vulnerable to predators. Although males are the larger sex at PWC, we found nothing to suggest that larger body size provided access to an expanded resource base. Instead we found high dietary overlap between sexes indicating that male and female K. hirtipes consume similar foods.									2	0	0	1	0	2			2151-0733	1931-7603		WOS:000375251800015

LOCATING SUITABLE HABITAT FOR A RARE SPECIES: EVALUATION OF A SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODEL FOR BOG TURTLES (GLYPTEMYS MUHLENBERGII) IN THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES								HERPETOLOGICAL CONSERVATION AND BIOLOGY				11	1			199	213					APR 2016	2016	Because rare and cryptic species can be difficult to locate, distribution maps for such species are often inaccurate or incomplete. Bog Turtles (Glyptemys muhlenbergii) are emblematic of this challenge. Conducting surveys of known, historical, and potential Bog Turtle habitat is a specific need stated in the Bog Turtle Northern Population Recovery Plan and in most Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategies of states in the southern population. To address this need, we constructed a species distribution model for the southern population of Bog Turtles and ground-validated the model to assess its ability to locate suitable Bog Turtle habitat. Our final model identified 998,325 ha of potentially suitable habitat. On-the-ground evaluation of habitat identified as potentially suitable was carried out at 113 wetlands in Georgia and 83 in South Carolina. Of these, only nine wetlands met criteria for suitable Bog Turtle habitat in Georgia and 13 in South Carolina. Trapping efforts at the nine Georgia sites and eight of the South Carolina sites showed Bog Turtles to be present at two of the Georgia sites. This ground-validation effort demonstrates that the species distribution model greatly over-predicts the amount of suitable habitat for Bog Turtles. Nonetheless, this manner of searching for rare and cryptic species does avoid the typical biases of haphazard searches and helps identify habitat on private property. Given these findings, the model is most useful when the area of interest is small, such as a county within the range of a species that currently has no known occurrence records.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2151-0733	1931-7603		WOS:000375251800022

The technology has been referred to by different names, including compact-disc microfluidics, lab-on-a-disk, lab-on-a-CD and bio-disk. This paper critically reviews the state-of-the-art in CD-based centrifugal microfluidics devices and attempts to identify the challenges that, if solved, would enable their use in the extreme point of care. Sample actuation, manufacturing, reagent storage and implementation, target multiplexing, bio-particle detection, required hardware and system disposal, and sustainability are the topics of focus.									2	0	0	1	0	2			2072-666X			WOS:000375209100001

The identification of genes and alleles that modify element content in the grains of cereals, including sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), is fundamental to developing breeding and selection methods aimed at increasing bioavailable element content and improving crop growth. We have developed a high-throughput work flow for the simultaneous measurement of multiple elements in sorghum seeds. We measured seed element levels in the genotyped Sorghum Association Panel, representing all major cultivated sorghum races from diverse geographic and climatic regions, and mapped alleles contributing to seed element variation across three environments by genome-wide association. We observed significant phenotypic and genetic correlation between several elements across multiple years and diverse environments. The power of combining high-precision measurements with genome-wide association was demonstrated by implementing rank transformation and a multilocus mixed model to map alleles controlling 20 element traits, identifying 255 loci affecting the sorghum seed ionome. Sequence similarity to genes characterized in previous studies identified likely causative genes for the accumulation of zinc, manganese, nickel, calcium, and cadmium in sorghum seeds. In addition to strong candidates for these five elements, we provide a list of candidate loci for several other elements. Our approach enabled the identification of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in strong linkage disequilibrium with causative polymorphisms that can be evaluated in targeted selection strategies for plant breeding and improvement.									5	0	0	3	0	5			0032-0889	1532-2548		WOS:000375424200009	26896393

However, surveys conducted in the Colombian highlands revealed a great diversity of these parasites infecting resident birds. To further investigate the relationship between Leucocytozoon diversity, the potential vectors, and altitudinal distribution, birds from 41 families were sampled at low and high elevations in Colombia. Blood samples were screened by microscopy, and a fragment of cytochrome b was amplified from Leucocytozoon-positive samples. The complete mitochondria! genome was also obtained for each morphospecies of Leucocytozoon. Leucocytozoon species were detected in resident birds, with various degrees of host specificity, at elevations from 2,400 to 3,950 meters above sea level, where five new host-parasite associations were discovered. Phylogenetic analysis based on the cytochrome b fragment suggested that two nominal taxa, L. fringillinarum and L. majoris, are species complexes. Blood sources of Simuliidae revealed generalist-feeding habits that included avian and mammalian hosts. Molecular analysis of parasites in black flies indicated a close relationship with the parasites found in birds. Our investigation provides further evidence that the distribution and transmission of Leucocytozoon species in the Neotropics are influenced by elevation, with the highest prevalence between 2,400 and 3,200 m asl.

The optical light curve of Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) is powered by thermalized gamma-rays produced by the decay of Ni-56 and Co-56, the main radioactive isotopes synthesized by the thermonuclear explosion of a C/O white dwarf.Aims. Gamma-rays escaping the ejecta can be used as a diagnostic tool for studying the characteristics of the explosion. In particular, it is expected that the analysis of the early gamma emission, near the maximum of the optical light curve, could provide information about the distribution of the radioactive elements in the debris.Methods. The gamma data obtained from SN2014J in M82 by the instruments on board INTEGRAL were analysed paying special attention to the effect that the detailed spectral response has on the measurements of the intensity of the lines.Results. The 158 keV emission of Ni-56 has been detected in SN2014J at similar to 5 sigma at low energy with both ISGRI and SPI around the maximum of the optical light curve. After correcting the spectral response of the detector, the fluxes in the lines suggest that, in addition to the bulk of radioactive elements buried in the central layers of the debris, there is a plume of Ni-56, with a significance of similar to 3 sigma, moving at high velocity and receding from the observer. The mass of the plume is in the range of similar to 0.03-0.08 M-circle dot.Conclusions. No SNIa explosion model has ever predicted the mass and geometrical distribution of Ni-56 suggested here. According to its optical properties, SN2014J looks like a normal SNIa, so it is extremely important to discern whether it is also representative in the gamma-ray band.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1432-0746			WOS:000373207800079

However, aspects in PFS systems compared with self-filled syringes (SFS) systems have never been explored. The aim of this study is to compare system vulnerabilities (SVs) in the two systems and understand the impact of PFS on medication safety and efficiency in the context of anesthesiology medication delivery in operating rooms.Methods: This study is primarily qualitative research, with a quantitative portion. A work system analysis was conducted to analyze the complicated anesthesia work system using human factors principles and identify SVs. Anesthesia providers were shadowed: (1) during general surgery cases (n = 8) exclusively using SFS and (2) during general surgery cases (n = 9) using all commercially available PFS. A proactive risk assessment focus group was followed to understand the risk of each identified SV.Results: PFS are superior to SFS in terms of the simplified work processes and the reduced number and associated risk of SVs. Eight SVs were found in the PFS system versus 21 in the SFS system. An SV example with high risk in the SFS system was a medication might need to be drawn-up during surgery while completing other requests simultaneously. This SV added cognitive complexity during anesthesiology medication delivery. However, it did not exist in the PFS system.Conclusions: The inclusion of PFS into anesthesiology medication delivery has the potential to improve system safety and work efficiency. However, there were still opportunities for further improvement by addressing the remaining SVs and newly introduced complexity.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0003-3022	1528-1175		WOS:000373352000013	26845139	
J	Jennings, Elaina; Ziaei, Ershad; Pang, Weichiang; van de Lindt, John W.; Shao, Xiaoyun; Bahmani, Pouria								Full-Scale Experimental Investigation of Second-Story Collapse Behavior in a Woodframe Building with an Over-Retrofitted First Story								JOURNAL OF PERFORMANCE OF CONSTRUCTED FACILITIES				30	2					04015004	10.1061/(ASCE)CF.1943-5509.0000736			APR 2016	2016	Soft-story woodframe buildings have been identified as a disaster preparedness problem throughout California and are present in many other states of the United States. These buildings can be readily identified by their large openings at the ground floor, often for parking, which results in a soft and weak first story that is prone to collapse in moderate to severe earthquakes. This paper presents the hybrid test results of a full-scale collapse test program that was carried out on a 3-story soft-story woodframe building with an overretrofitted first story. The overretrofitted design was constrained to the soft story only, essentially representing a retrofit that would likely drive the soft-story failure mechanism into the upper stories. The objectives of the collapse testing were to (1)quantify the collapse shift into the upper stories when the first story is overstrengthened, (2)investigate the collapse mechanisms of a woodframe building constructed with archaic building materials and style in the upper level, and (3)investigate the collapse capacity of the unretrofitted structurally deficient upper stories composed of archaic building materials. The overretrofitted design and collapse testing with results are presented in this paper. Even when overstrengthened, a very high-intensity earthquake, approximately 125-150% of the maximum considered earthquake, is required to collapse the archaic assemblies found in the upper stories of soft-story woodframe buildings. This high-intensity earthquake caused a 6.7% residual drift in the upper two stories which resulted in multiple fastener push-outs and dramatic softening (as indicated by the change in fundamental period). The collapse capacity of the archaic and unretrofitted upper two stories was approximately 20-kN lateral strength and 8% lateral drift.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0887-3828	1943-5509		WOS:000372805300013

Highly sensitive and broadband RF sensors are promising candidates for such a technique. In this work, we present a highly sensitive and tunable RF sensor, which is based on interference processes and built with a 100-nm slotline structure. The highly concentrated RF fields, up to similar to 1.76 x 10(7) V/m, enable strong interactions between giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) and fields for high-sensitivity operations. We also provide two modeling approaches to extract cell dielectric properties from measured scattering parameters. GUVs of different molecular compositions are synthesized and analyzed with the RF sensor at similar to 2, similar to 2.5, and similar to 2.8 GHz with an initial vertical bar S-21 vertical bar(min) of similar to -100 dB. Corresponding GUV dielectric properties are obtained. A one-dimensional scanning of single GUV is also demonstrated.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0018-9480	1557-9670		WOS:000374166700032	27713585

Instantaneous Directional Growth of Block Copolymer Nanowires During Heterogeneous Radical Polymerization (HRP)								NANO LETTERS				16	4			2873	2877		10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b00794			APR 2016	2016	Polymeric nano wires that consist of ultrahigh molecular weight block copolymers were instantaneously prepared via one-step surfactant-free heterogeneous radical polymerization (HRP). Under heterogeneous reaction and initiator-starvation conditions, the sequential copolymerization of hydrophilic and hydrophobic monomers facilitates the formation of amphiphilic ultrahigh molecular weight block copolymers, which instantaneously assemble to polymeric nanowires. As polymerization progresses, initially formed nanoparticles exhibit the directional growth due to localized repulsive forces of hydrophilic blocks and confinement of the hydrophobic blocks that adopt favorable high aspect ratio nanowire morphologies. Using one-step synthetic approach that requires only four ingredients (water as a solvent, two polymerizable monomers (one hydrophilic and one hydrophobic), and water-soluble initiator), block copolymer nanowires similar to 70 nm in diameter and hundreds of microns in length are instantaneously grown. For example, when 2-(N,N-dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) and styrene (St) were copolymerized, high aspect ratio nanowires consist of ultrahigh (>10(6) g/mol) molecular weight pDMAEMA-b-St block copolymers and the presence of temperature responsive pDMAEMA blocks facilitates nanowire diameter changes as a function of temperature. These morphologies may serve as structural components of the higher order biological constructs at micro and larger length scales, ranging from single strand nano wires to engineered biomolecular networks capable of responding to diverse and transient environmental signals, and capable of dimensional changes triggered by external stimuli.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1530-6984	1530-6992		WOS:000374274600112	27002238

First, we present new relationships relating the ve-domination to some other domination parameters, answering in the affirmative four open questions posed in the 2007 PhD thesis by Lewis. Then we provide an upper bound for the independent ve-domination number in terms of the ve-domination number for every nontrivial connected K (1,k) -free graph, with k a parts per thousand yen 3, and we show that the independent ve-domination number is bounded above by the domination number for every nontrivial tree. Finally, we establish an upper bound on the ve-domination number for connected C (5)-free graphs, improving a recent bound given for trees.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0001-9054	1420-8903		WOS:000374110300008

Here. we study the initial evolution of both electron-proton (e(-) - p(+)) and electron-positron (e(+/-)) relativistic jets, focusing on their lateral interaction with ambient plasma. We follow the evolution of toroidal magnetic fields generated by both the kinetic Kelvin-Helmholtz and Mushroom instabilities. For an e(-) - p(+) jet, the induced magnetic field collimates the jet and electrons are perpendicularly accelerated. As the instabilities saturate and subsequently weaken, the magnetic polarity switches from clockwise to counterclockwise in the middle of the jet. For an e(+/-) jet, we find strong mixing of electrons and positrons with the ambient plasma, resulting in the creation of a bow shock. The merging of current filaments generates density inhomogeneities that. initiate a forward shock. Strong jet-ambient plasma mixing prevents a full development of the jet (on the scale studied), revealing evidence for both jet collimation and particle acceleration in the forming bow shock. Differences in the magnetic field structure generated by e(-) - p(+) and e(+/-) jets may contribute to the polarization properties of the observed emission in AGN jets and gamma-ray bursts.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000373741300013

At lower energies, AGNs and Seyfert galaxies can explain the background, but not above similar or equal to 0.3 MeV. Beyond similar to 10 MeV blazars appear to account for the flux observed. That leaves an unexplained gap for which different candidates have been proposed, including annihilations of WIMPS. One candidate is. Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Early studies concluded that they were able to account for the gamma-ray background in the gap, while later work attributed a significantly lower contribution to them. All those estimates were based on SN Ia explosion models that. did not reflect the full 3D hydrodynamics of SN Ia explosions. In addition, new measurements obtained since 2010 have provided new, direct estimates of high-z SN Ia rates beyond z similar to 2. We take into account these new advances to see the predicted contribution to the gamma-ray background. We use here a wide variety of explosion models and a plethora of new measurements of SN Ia rates. SNe Ia still fall short of the observed background. Only for a fit, which would imply similar to 150% systematic error in detecting SN Ia events, do the theoretical predictions approach the observed fluxes. This fit is, however, at odds at the highest redshifts with recent SN Ia rate. estimates. Other astrophysical sources such as flat-spectrum radio quasars do match the observed flux levels in the MeV regime, while SNe Ia make up to 30%-50% of the observed flux.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000373741300061

A phase I/IIa clinical trial in stage IV melanoma of an autologous tumor-dendritic cell fusion (dendritoma) vaccine with low dose interleukin-2								CANCER IMMUNOLOGY IMMUNOTHERAPY				65	4			383	392		10.1007/s00262-016-1809-6			APR 2016	2016	Stage IV melanoma has high mortality, largely unaffected by traditional therapies. Immunotherapy including cytokine therapies and checkpoint inhibitors improves outcomes, but has significant toxicities. In this phase I/IIa trial, we investigated safety and efficacy of a dendritoma vaccine, an active, specific immunotherapy, in stage IV melanoma patients.Autologous tumor lysate and dendritic cells were fused creating dendritoma vaccines for each patient. Phase I patients were vaccinated every 3 months with IL-2 given for 5 days after initial inoculation. Phase IIa patients were vaccinated every 6 weeks with IL-2 given on days 1, 3 and 5 after initial inoculation. Toxicity and clinical outcomes were assessed.Twenty-five patients were enrolled and inoculated. All dendritoma and IL-2 toxicities were < grade 3. Median overall survival (OS) was 16.1 months with projected 5-year survival = 29 %. Significant OS improvement for patients receiving a parts per thousand yen3 versus < 3 inoculations (43.1 vs. 16.7 %, p = 0.02) was observed. Patients with no evidence of disease (NED) showed improved OS (80 vs. 14 %, p = 0.005). No clinicopathologic differences were present between phase I (n = 10) and IIa (n = 15) patients; phase IIa patients received more frequent dosing and higher mean number of inoculations. Phase IIa median OS was significantly higher (23.8 vs. 8.7 months, p = 0.004).The dendritoma vaccine has minimal toxicity profile with potential clinical benefit. There was OS advantage for NED stage IV patients, those receiving higher number of doses and increased frequency. Based on these results, we initiated a phase IIb trial utilizing improved dendritoma technology in the adjuvant setting for NED stage III/IV melanoma patients.									5	0	0	3	0	5			0340-7004	1432-0851		WOS:000373952700003	26894495

Experts at the summit outlined the potential public health impact of organ banking, discussed the major remaining scientific challenges that need to be overcome in order to bank organs, and identified key opportunities to accelerate progress toward this goal. Many areas of public health could be revolutionized by the banking of organs and other complex tissues, including transplantation, oncofertility, tissue engineering, trauma medicine and emergency preparedness, basic biomedical research and drug discovery - and even space travel. Key remaining scientific sub-challenges were discussed including ice nucleation and growth, cryoprotectant and osmotic toxicities, chilling injury, thermo-mechanical stress, the need for rapid and uniform rewarming, and ischemia/reperfusion injury. A variety of opportunities to overcome these challenge areas were discussed, i.e. preconditioning for enhanced stress tolerance, nanoparticle rewarming, cyroprotectant screening strategies, and the use of cryoprotectant cocktails including ice binding agents.									3	0	0	2	0	3			0011-2240	1090-2392		WOS:000374078600016	26687388

Ceramic bodies were prepared from calcined powders by sintering from 1400 degrees C to 1700 degrees C for 20 h. Density was determined by the Archimedes method and showed pellets reached about 99% of Y2O3 density for temperatures 1450 degrees C, and reached 98% for sintering at 1700 degrees C for Lu2O3. The content of open-volume defects was followed by positron annihilation lifetime (PAL) measurements. For both materials, two lifetimes were obtained. The faster lifetime, 211 ps for Y2O3 and 204 ps for Lu2O3, was assigned to bulk annihilation with possible contribution of grain boundaries. The longer lifetime was assigned to positronium annihilation in open-volume defects with radii of 2-4 angstrom. Doppler broadening analysis revealed the same type of defect in Lu2O3 ceramics for all sintering temperatures. PAL analysis results showed that densification was achieved through the elimination and agglomeration of open-volume defects. Thermoluminescence (TL) measurements of Y2O3 showed that sintering is beneficial in eliminating traps and/or recombination centers, and that higher sintering temperatures increase TL signal.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000373931900051

Here, we characterize a novel Streptococcus strain, designated strain A12, isolated from supragingival dental plaque of a caries-free individual. A12 not only expressed the ADS pathway at high levels under a variety of conditions but also effectively inhibited growth and two intercellular signaling pathways of the dental caries pathogen Streptococcus mutans. A12 produced copious amounts of H2O2 via the pyruvate oxidase enzyme that were sufficient to arrest the growth of S. mutans. A12 also produced a protease similar to challisin (Sgc) of Streptococcus gordonii that was able to block the competence-stimulating peptide (CSP)-ComDE signaling system, which is essential for bacteriocin production by S. mutans. Wild-type A12, but not an sgc mutant derivative, could protect the sensitive indicator strain Streptococcus sanguinis SK150 from killing by the bacteriocins of S. mutans. A12, but not S. gordonii, could also block the XIP (comX-inducing peptide) signaling pathway, which is the proximal regulator of genetic competence in S. mutans, but Sgc was not required for this activity. The complete genome sequence of A12 was determined, and phylogenomic analyses compared A12 to streptococcal reference genomes. A12 was most similar to Streptococcus australis and Streptococcus parasanguinis but sufficiently different that it may represent a new species. A12-like organisms may play crucial roles in the promotion of stable, health-associated oral biofilm communities by moderating plaque pH and interfering with the growth and virulence of caries pathogens.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0099-2240	1098-5336		WOS:000373342400022	26826230

Understanding these truncated probability density functions is paramount to the overall manufacturing industry, as more accurate evaluations of a process output will lead to a greater understanding of the process itself and associated costs. Furthermore, convolutions of truncated random variables play an important role in a multistage manufacturing system, where a screening inspection is performed at each stage. While the convolutions of normal distributions have been well established, the convolutions of truncated normal distributions have neither been understood clearly, nor have theoretical foundations been thoroughly explored in the literature, despite their practical importance. The mathematical framework and approximations using the error function for the convolutions of truncated normal random variables with three different types of quality characteristics are presented here. The convolutions established in this paper should enhance the accuracy and precision of real-world production processes particularly where components are required for assembling into the final, product.

An explicit approach to capture diffusive effects in finite water-content method for solving vadose zone flow								JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY				535				270	281		10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.01.078			APR 2016	2016	Vadose zone flow problems are usually solved from the Richards equation. Solution to the Richards equation is generally challenging because the hydraulic conductivity and diffusivity in the equation are strongly non-linear functions of water content. The finite water-content method was proposed as an alternative general solution method of the vadose zone flow problem for infiltration, falling slugs, and vadose zone response to water table dynamics based on discretizing the water content domain into numerous bins instead of the traditional spatial discretization. In this study, we develop an improved approach to the original finite water-content method (referred to as TO method hereinafter) that better simulates diffusive effects but retains the robustness of the TO method. The approach treats advection and diffusion separately and considers diffusion on a bin by bin basis. After discretizing into water content bins, we treat the conductivity and diffusivity in individual bins as water content dependent constant evaluated at given water content corresponding to each bin. For each bin, we can solve the flow equations analytically since the hydraulic conductivity and diffusivity can be treated as a constant. We then develop solutions for each bin to determine the diffusive water amounts at each time step. The water amount ahead of the convective front for each bin is redistributed among water content bins to account for diffusive effects. The application of developed solution is straightforward only involving algebraic manipulations at each time step. The method can mainly improve water content profiles, but has no significant difference for the total infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration compared to the TO method. Although the method separately deals with advection and diffusion, it can account for the coupling effects of advection and diffusion reasonably well. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The fibers were fabricated via a conventional drawing tower method and, subsequently, tapered down to achieve silicon core diameters of similar to 1 mu m, the smallest optical cores for this class of fiber to date. Characterization of the material properties have shown that the taper process helps to improve the local crystallinity of the silicon core, resulting in a significant reduction in the material loss. By exploiting the combination of small cores and low losses, these tapered fibers have enabled the first observation of nonlinear transmission within a polycrystalline silicon waveguide of any type. As the fiber drawing method is highly scalable, it opens a route for the development of low-cost and flexible nonlinear silicon photonic systems.

Highly buoyant bent-over plumes in a boundary layer								ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT				131				97	114		10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.01.046			APR 2016	2016	Highly buoyant plumes, such as wildfire plumes, in low to moderate wind speeds have initial trajectories that are steeper than many industrial waste plumes. They will rise further into the atmosphere before bending significantly. In such cases the plume's trajectory will be influenced by the vertical variation in horizontal velocity of the atmospheric boundary layer. This paper examined the behavior of a plume in an unstratified environment with a power-law ambient velocity profile. Examination of previously published experimental measurements of plume trajectory show that inclusion of the boundary layer velocity profile in the plume model often provides better predictions of the plume trajectory compared to algebraic expressions developed for uniform flow plumes. However, there are many cases in which uniform velocity profile algebraic expressions are as good as boundary layer models. It is shown that it is only important to model the role of the atmospheric boundary layer velocity profile in cases where either the momentum length (square root of source momentum flux divided by the reference wind speed) or buoyancy length (buoyancy flux divided by the reference wind speed cubed) is significantly greater than the plume release height within the boundary layer. This criteria is rarely met with industrial waste plumes, but it is important in modeling wildfire plumes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We empirically evaluated the effects of near visually realistic vs. non-realistic stylized appearance of virtual humans on the emotional response of participants in a medical virtual reality system that was designed to educate users in recognizing the signs and symptoms of patient deterioration. In a between subjects experiment protocol, participants interacted with one of three different appearances of a virtual patient, namely visually realistic, cartoon-shaded and charcoal-sketch like conditions in a mixed reality simulation. Emotional impact were measured via a combination of quantitative objective measures were gathered using skin Electrodermal Activity (EDA) sensors, and quantitative subjective measures such as the Differential Emotion Survey (DES IV), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and Social Presence questionnaire. The emotional states of the participants were analyzed across four distinct time steps during which the medical condition of the virtual patient deteriorated (an emotionally stressful interaction), and were contrasted to a baseline affective state. Objective EDA results showed that in all three conditions, male participants exhibited greater levels of arousal as compared to female participants. We found that negative affect levels were significantly lower in the visually realistic condition, as compared to the stylized appearance conditions. Furthermore, in emotional dimensions of interest-excitement, surprise, anger, fear and guilt participants in all conditions responded similarly. However, in social emotional constructs of shyness, presence, perceived personality, and enjoyment-joy, we found that participants responded differently in the visually realistic condition as compared to the cartoon and sketch conditions. Our study suggests that virtual human appearance can affect not only critical emotional reactions in affective inter-personal training scenarios, but also users' perceptions of personality and social characteristic of the virtual interlocutors.

In this paper, we explore whether one group member's agency (e.g. if they are real or virtual) can indirectly affect behavior with other group members. We also consider whether variations in the agency of a group member directly affects behavior with that group member. To do so. we examined gaze behavior during a team training exercise. in which sixty-nine nurses worked with a surgeon and an anesthesiologist to prepare a simulated patient for surgery. The agency of the surgeon and the anesthesiologist were varied between conditions. Nurses' gaze behavior was coded using videos of their interactions. Agency was observed to directly affect behavior, such that participants spent more time gazing at virtual teammates than human teammates. However, participants continued to obey polite gaze norms with virtual teammates. In contrast, agency was not observed to indirectly affect gaze behavior. The presence of a second human did not affect participants' gaze behavior with virtual teammates.

However, contradiction of the drained instability in loose granular material exists in the reported test results, which is considered because of the condition of constant deviatoric stress (q) not strictly satisfied in the literature. Because the variation of q during the CSD test has significant effects on the test results, more data from tests under a true constant q condition are needed to clarify this subject. In this paper, CSD and conventional undrained triaxial tests in both compressive and extensive loading were performed to investigate the instability behavior of loose sand. All the CSD tests were conducted by advanced variable confining pressure triaxial apparatus, in which a true constant q was maintained during the test; thus, more reliable results were obtained. It is observed experimentally that when a specimen is sheared along a fully drained stress path with a constant q but decreasing effective mean normal stress, instability occurs before the effective stress path reaches the failure line. It is also found that the onset of instability for both undrained and CSD tests are initiated at almost the same stress ratio for a given void ratio of specimens. Hill's stability conditions in terms of the sign of the second work increment are used to interpret the experimental results of instability. The high-quality test results obtained in this study may help to explain the contradiction reported in the literature and clarify the controversy in drained instability.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1532-3641	1943-5622		WOS:000372800600011

Coupling with this new sampling method, two practical procedures are developed for estimating the failure probability: one is a coarse procedure for the analysis of ordinary problems and the other is a refined procedure for the analysis of critical problems. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed sampling method and procedures for estimating the failure probability are demonstrated through a series of examples. The results show that the proposed approach is valid for general applications and can yield an accurate estimate of the failure probability. The accuracy and efficiency are not influenced by the distribution type of uncertain variables, correlation among uncertain variables, nonlinearity of the performance function, and dimension of uncertain variables.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0733-9399	1943-7889		WOS:000372801900011

Religion and Support for Adoption by Same-Sex Couples: The Relative Effects of Religious Tradition, Practices, and Beliefs								JOURNAL OF FAMILY ISSUES				37	6			789	813		10.1177/0192513X14536564			APR 2016	2016	This article examines the relative impact of religious factors on Americans' attitudes toward adoption by same-sex couples. Drawing upon national survey data, we fit logistic regression models and compute standardized logistic regression coefficients to estimate the relative net effects of religious tradition, practices, and beliefs about the Bible on support for same-sex adoption. Findings reveal that religious factors are among the strongest predictors of opposition to same-sex adoption, but that religious tradition has no significant effect on support for same-sex adoption once frequency of religious practice and beliefs about the Bible are held constant. Americans who more frequently engage in practices such as religious service attendance and sacred text reading are less supportive of same-sex adoption, and compared to biblical literalists, those who believe the Bible requires interpretation, contains human error, or is a book of history/legends are all more likely to support same-sex adoption. Findings suggest that religious affiliations matter less for predicting same-sex adoption attitudes than how Americans practice and hold their faith.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0192-513X	1552-5481		WOS:000372813100003

Effective and Ineffective Coping Strategies in a Low-Autonomy Work Environment								JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY				21	2			154	168		10.1037/a0039898			APR 2016	2016	The authors examined the effectiveness of different coping strategies in buffering the negative effects of uncontrollable stressors and predicting mental health symptoms in a low-autonomy work environment using a longitudinal design. Soldiers in training indicated the extent to which they engaged in various coping strategies to deal with stressors related to the training environment at 4 different points in time. Factor analyses of soldiers in 2 different countries (i.e., United States and Australia) yielded 5 coping dimensions: active coping, acceptance of demands, seeking social support, humor, and denial/selfcriticism. Among U.S. soldiers in basic training, acceptance of demands and denial/self-criticism interacted with the magnitude of basic-training stressors to predict mental health symptoms (depression and anxiety) at 3 different points during training while controlling for symptoms at the immediate prior time period. Acceptance buffered soldiers from the negative effects of the stressors, whereas denial/self-criticism exacerbated the effects of the stressors. The results of LGC models also indicated that the slopes of acceptance and active coping were negatively related to the slope of mental health symptoms across training, whereas the slope for denial/self-criticism was positively related to the slope of symptoms. Active coping was less predictive of functioning in the face of stressors and in the prediction of symptoms over time. The results demonstrated that in a low-autonomy occupational setting, acceptance coping was more effective in facilitating good mental health outcomes compared with other coping strategies considered important in prior research (e.g., active coping).									1	0	0	0	0	1			1076-8998	1939-1307		WOS:000373220600003	26641486

The compounds all had the general formula A(2)AEM(VO4)(2) (A=K, Na, Li; AE=Ba, Sr; M=Co, Fe, Mn). They are all variations of the glaserite structural type and range in symmetry from P-3m1 to P-3 to P2(1)/c. Most of the derivatives contain a planar threefold rotation operation, making them possible spin frustration candidates. Single crystal structural analyses were performed on many of the derivatives to obtain a detailed understanding of the distortions of the tetrahedral building blocks that accommodate the symmetry distortions. A hydrothermal growth method was developed to grow high quality single crystals of sizes up to 2-3 mm/edge. This method can be generalized for large crystal growth to enable magnetic and neutron diffraction studies that require relatively large single crystals. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

A performance-based retrofit option focusing on stiffening/strengthening only the soft ground story, as regulated by FEMA guidelines, was proposed in an attempt to achieve collapse prevention of the ground story while at the same time ensuring damage control of the upper stories. This paper focuses on an alternative retrofit approach that focuses on energy dissipation, in order to achieve a performance that is essentially comparable to the inherent performance target defined in FEMA guidelines. A viscous damper retrofit is designed based on conclusions drawn from parametric studies. Then, the proposed retrofit is validated via slow pseudodynamic hybrid testing of a full-scale three-story building. The test data are presented, interpreted, and compared against both pretest numerical predictions and posttest simulation results after model calibration. It is demonstrated that a damping retrofit, as compared to a stiffening/strengthening retrofit, better complies with the FEMA retrofit standards due to its effectiveness in reducing ground-story peak deformations while being less likely to propagate damage to the upper stories.

High day and night temperatures result in major lipid alterations								PLANT CELL AND ENVIRONMENT				39	4			787	803		10.1111/pce.12649			APR 2016	2016	Understanding how wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plants under high temperature (HT) regulate lipid composition is critical to developing climate-resilient varieties. We measured 165 glycerolipids and sterol derivatives under optimum and high day and night temperatures in wheat leaves using electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Levels of polar lipid fatty acyl chain unsaturation were lower in both heat-tolerant genotype Ventnor and susceptible genotype Karl 92 under HT, compared with optimum temperature. The lower unsaturation was predominantly because of lower levels of 18:3 acyl chains and higher levels of 18:1 and 16:0 acyl chains. Levels of 18:3-containing triacylglycerols increased threefold/more under HT, consistent with their possible role in sequestering fatty acids during membrane lipid remodelling. Phospholipids containing odd-numbered or oxidized acyl chains accumulated in leaves under HT. Sterol glycosides (SG) and 16:0-acylated sterol glycosides (ASG) were higher under HT than optimum temperatures. Ventnor had lower amounts of phospholipids with oxidized acyl chains under HT and higher amounts of SG and 16:0-ASG than Karl 92. Taken together, the data demonstrate that wheat leaf lipid composition is altered by HT, in which some lipids are particularly responsive to HT, and that two wheat genotypes, chosen for their differing physiological responses to HT, differ in lipid profile under HT.Understanding how wheat plants under high temperature regulate lipid composition is critical to developing climate-resilient varieties. Lipid remodeling under high-temperature stress in heat-tolerant and susceptible genotypes resulted in decreases in the amounts of more unsaturated lipid species and increases in the amounts of less unsaturated lipid species, sterol glycosides, 16:0-acylated sterol glycosides, 18:3-acyl-containing triacylglycerols, and phospholipids containing odd-numbered or oxidized acyl chains. The two analyzed wheat genotypes, chosen for their differing physiological responses to high temperature, differed in lipid profiles under high temperature.									4	0	0	4	0	4			0140-7791	1365-3040		WOS:000373458800006	26436679

The comparative effects of group prenatal care on psychosocial outcomes								ARCHIVES OF WOMENS MENTAL HEALTH				19	2			259	269		10.1007/s00737-015-0564-6			APR 2016	2016	To compare the psychosocial outcomes of the CenteringPregnancy (CP) model of group prenatal care to individual prenatal care, we conducted a prospective cohort study of women who chose CP group (N = 124) or individual prenatal care (N = 124). Study participants completed the first survey at study recruitment (mean gestational age 12.5 weeks), with 89 % completing the second survey (mean gestational age 32.7 weeks) and 84 % completing the third survey (6 weeks' postpartum). Multiple linear regression models compared changes by prenatal care model in pregnancy-specific distress, prenatal planning-preparation and avoidance coping, perceived stress, affect and depressive symptoms, pregnancy-related empowerment, and postpartum maternal-infant attachment and maternal functioning. Using intention-to-treat models, group prenatal care participants demonstrated a 3.2 point greater increase (p < 0.05) in their use of prenatal planning-preparation coping strategies. While group participants did not demonstrate significantly greater positive outcomes in other measures, women who were at greater psychosocial risk benefitted from participation in group prenatal care. Among women reporting inadequate social support in early pregnancy, group participants demonstrated a 2.9 point greater decrease (p = 0.03) in pregnancy-specific distress in late pregnancy and 5.6 point higher mean maternal functioning scores postpartum (p = 0.03). Among women with high pregnancy-specific distress in early pregnancy, group participants had an 8.3 point greater increase (p < 0.01) in prenatal planning-preparation coping strategies in late pregnancy and a 4.9 point greater decrease (p = 0.02) in postpartum depressive symptom scores. This study provides further evidence that group prenatal care positively impacts the psychosocial well-being of women with greater stress or lower personal coping resources. Large randomized studies are needed to establish conclusively the biological and psychosocial benefits of group prenatal care for all women.									5	0	0	3	0	5			1434-1816	1435-1102		WOS:000372601800006	26260037

EFFECTS OF AN ANTIDEPRESSANT MIXTURE ON THE BRAIN SEROTONIN AND PREDATION BEHAVIOR OF HYBRID STRIPED BASS								ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY				35	4			938	945		10.1002/etc.3114			APR 2016	2016	Antidepressants have been found in measurable concentrations in final treated wastewater effluent and receiving waters throughout the world. Studies have shown that these concentrations are typically not overtly toxic, but the psychotropic mode of action of these chemicals warrants examination of their behavioral effects. Exposure of hybrid striped bass to the antidepressants fluoxetine or venlafaxine alone has been shown to cause decreased brain serotonin levels and increased time to capture prey at concentrations typically 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than environmentally relevant concentrations. In the present study, equally effective doses of fluoxetine and venlafaxine were used to perform a mixture study, using a toxic unit approach to determine whether these antidepressants may act in an additive manner at lower concentrations. The results indicated that mixtures of these antidepressants caused decreased brain serotonin and increased time to capture prey at concentrations lower than reported in previous studies. Low concentration mixtures caused an additive effect on brain serotonin levels and time to capture prey, whereas higher concentrations were less than additive. The results were consistent with the dose addition concept, with higher concentration mixtures potentially saturating the effects on serotonin in the brain. Results from the present study indicate that antidepressants have the potential to be additive on the biochemical and individual scale, which necessitates more robust analysis of antidepressant mixtures and their potential to act together in low concentration scenarios.

J	Wan, Nianfeng; Vahidi, Ardalan; Luckow, Andre								Reconstructing maximum likelihood trajectory of probe vehicles between sparse updates								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES				65				16	30		10.1016/j.trc.2016.01.010			APR 2016	2016	Data from connected probe vehicles can be critical in estimating road traffic conditions. Unfortunately, current available data is usually sparse due to the low reporting frequency and the low penetration rate of probe vehicles. To help fill the gaps in data, this paper presents an approach for estimating the maximum likelihood trajectory (MLT) of a probe vehicle in between two data updates on arterial roads. A public data feed from transit buses in the city of San Francisco is used as an example data source. Low frequency updates (at every 200 m or 90 s) leaves much to be inferred. We first estimate travel time statistics along the road and queue patterns at intersections from historical probe data. The path is divided into short segments, and an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is proposed for allocating travel time statistics to each segment. Then the trajectory with the maximum likelihood is generated based on segment travel time statistics. The results are compared with high frequency ground truth data in multiple scenarios, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, in estimating both the trajectory while moving and the stop positions and durations at intersections.

A multi-period optimization model for the deployment of public electric vehicle charging stations on network								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES				65				128	143		10.1016/j.trc.2016.01.008			APR 2016	2016	A multi-period multipath refueling location model is developed to expand public electric vehicle (EV) charging network to dynamically satisfy origin-destination (O-D) trips with the growth of EV market. The model captures the dynamics in the topological structure of network and determines the cost-effective station rollout scheme on both spatial and temporal dimensions. The multi-period location problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear program and solved by a heuristic based on genetic algorithm. The model and heuristic are justified using the benchmark Sioux Falls road network and implemented in a case study of South Carolina. The results indicate that the charging station rollout scheme is subject to a number of major factors, including geographic distributions of cities, vehicle range, and deviation choice, and is sensitive to the types of charging station sites.

Batsch) challenges efforts to accurately dissect the genetic architecture of complex traits. Standardized phenotypic assessment of pedigree-linked breeding germplasm and new molecular strategies and analytical approaches developed and conducted during the RosBREED project for enabling marker-assisted breeding (MAB) in Rosaceae crops has overcome several aspects of this challenge. The genetic underpinnings of fruit size (fruit equatorial diameter (FD)) and weight (fresh weight (FW)), two most important components of yield, were investigated using the pedigree-based analysis (PBA) approach under a Bayesian framework which has emerged as an alternative strategy to study the genetics of quantitative traits within diverse breeding germplasm across breeding programs. In this study, a complex pedigree with the common founder "Orange Cling" was identified and FD and FW data from 2011 and 2012 analyzed. A genetic model including genetic additive and dominance effects was considered, and its robustness was evaluated by using various prior and initial values in the Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure. Five QTLs were identified which accounted for up to 29 and 17% of the phenotypic variation for FD and FW, respectively. Additionally, genomic breeding values were obtained for both traits, with accuracies >85 %. This approach serves as a model study for performing PBA across diverse pedigrees. By incorporating multiple breeding programs, the method and results presented support and highlight the ability of this strategy to identify genomic resources as targets for DNA marker development and subsequent MAB within each program.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1614-2942	1614-2950		WOS:000372272300011

Journal of primary care & community health				7	2			107	12		10.1177/2150131915626562			2016-Apr	2016	This article describes the impact of an 8-week community program implemented by trained volunteers on the hypertension self-management of 185 patients who were batch randomized to intervention or wait-list control groups. Compared with control group participants, a higher proportion of treatment group participants moved from the cognitive to behavioral stages of motivational readiness for being physically active (P < .001), practicing healthy eating habits (P = .001), handling stress well (P = .001), and living an overall healthy lifestyle (P = .003). They also demonstrated a greater average increase in perceived competence for self-management, F(1.134) = 4.957, P = .028, eta2 = .036, and a greater increase in mean hypertension-related knowledge, F(1.160) = 16.571, P < .0005, eta(2) = .094. Enduring lifestyle changes necessary for chronic disease self-management require that psychosocial determinants of health behavior are instilled, which is typically beyond standard medical practice. We recommend peer-led, community-based programs as a complement to clinical care and support the increasing health system interest in promoting population health beyond clinical walls.									0	0	0	0	0	0				2150-1327		MEDLINE:26792906	26792906	
J	Liu, Huaie; Feng, Guohua; Zeng, Weilin; Li, Xiaomei; Bai, Yao; Deng, Shuang; Ruan, Yonghua; Morris, James; Li, Siman; Yang, Zhaoqing; Cui, Liwang								A more appropriate white blood cell count for estimating malaria parasite density in Plasmodium vivax patients in northeastern Myanmar								ACTA TROPICA				156				152	156		10.1016/j.actatropica.2016.01.018			APR 2016	2016	The conventional method of estimating parasite densities employ an assumption of 8000 white blood cells (WBCs)/mu l. However, due to leucopenia in malaria patients, this number appears to overestimate parasite densities. In this study, we assessed the accuracy of parasite density estimated using this assumed WBC count in eastern Myanmar, where Plasmodium vivax has become increasingly prevalent. From 256 patients with uncomplicated P. vivax malaria, we estimated parasite density and counted WBCs by using an automated blood cell counter. It was found that WBC counts were not significantly different between patients of different gender, axillary temperature, and body mass index levels, whereas they were significantly different between age groups of patients and the time points of measurement. The median parasite densities calculated with the actual WBC counts (1903/mu l) and the assumed WBC count of 8000/mu l (2570/mu l) were significantly different. We demonstrated that using the assumed WBC count of 8000 cells/mu l to estimate parasite densities of P. vivax malaria patients in this area would lead to an overestimation. For P. vivax patients aged five years and older, an assumed WBC count of 5500/mu l best estimated parasite densities. This study provides more realistic assumed WBC counts for estimating parasite densities in P. vivax patients from low-endemicity areas of Southeast Asia. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, even with LRFD, the need to reduce the variation in the predicted performance of a geotechnical system (or a geotechnical structure), referred to herein as the system response under applied loads, is still apparent. This paper presents a novel approach for applying existing LRFD codes, with explicit consideration of design robustness, safety, and cost efficiency. The recently developed reliability-based robust geotechnical design (RGD) approach is modified such that it can be integrated with the standard LRFD approach. This modified RGD approach is termed R-LRFD, which stands for Robust Load and Resistance Factor Design. In R-LRFD, the robustness of the system response against the variation in uncertain parameters is explicitly considered. Unlike the reliability-based design (RBD), the user is not required to conduct a full statistical characterization of uncertain parameters. With R-LRFD, the gain in the robustness, as reflected by the reduction in the sensitivity of the system response to the recognized but unquantified uncertainty of input parameters, is accompanied by an increase in cost. Thus, the concepts of Pareto front and knee point are introduced to aid in making an informed design decision. Further, a simplified procedure is developed to identify the most preferred design (knee point) in the design space, which is generally solved with multi objective optimization algorithms. The effectiveness and significance of the proposed R-LRFD approach are demonstrated with two examples: one is the design of drilled shaft in sand (illustrated with a discrete design space) and the other is the design of drilled shaft in clay (illustrated with a continuous design space).

We also examined characteristics of juvenile offenders who committed only a single misdemeanor offense, compared to non-juvenile offenders. Finally, we examined the variables that accounted for group differences in persistence of juvenile offending. Early adverse experiences including family-related adversities, mental health problems, identification as having school-related disabilities and juvenile recidivism accounted for more than 20 % of the variance in adult offending. Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed several time-dependent covariates including gender, age at first offense and repeat versus one time offending. Contrary to the view that the one time, misdemeanor level juvenile offending represents only minor departure from normative adolescent behavior, we found that this group of offenders differed significantly from non-delinquents on every category of risk for adult offending and also were more likely than non-delinquents to commit felonies as adults. Finally, in comparing adolescence-limited offenders with life-course persistent offenders, we accounted for more than 50 % of the variance in criminal outcomes on the basis of measures of background, early adversity, psychological characteristics and age of first juvenile arrest or referral.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1062-1024	1573-2843		WOS:000371807000005

Their remarkable properties result from ultrahigh density and ultrafine size of Y-Ti-O nanoclusters within the ferritic matrix. In this work, we applied a high-energy synchrotron radiation X-ray to study the deformation process of three advanced ODS materials including 14YWT, MA957, and 9-Cr ODS steel. Only the relatively large nanoparticles in the 9-Cr ODS were observed in the synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The nanoclusters in both 14YWT and MA957 were invisible in the measurement due to their non-stoichiometric nature. Due to the different sizes of nanoparticles and nanoclusters in the materials, the Orowan looping was considered to be the major strengthening mechanism in the 9-Cr ODS, while the dispersed-barrier-hardening is dominant strengthening mechanism in both 14YWT and MA957, This analysis was inferred from the different build-up rates of dislocation density when plastic deformation was initiated. Finally, the dislocation densities interpreted from the X-ray measurements were successfully modeled using the Bergstrom's dislocation models. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

First signs of resistance in the field are reported at low frequency. In this study, four resistant isolate/mutants were used to explore still unknown mechanisms leading to dimethachlone resistance.RESULTSThe resistant isolate/mutants had significantly higher EC50 values compared with the sensitive control isolates. Cross-resistance was confirmed between dimethachlone and procymidone, iprodione and fludioxonil. The resistant isolate/mutants revealed a decreased mycelial growth rate, were less pathogenic on leaves of oilseed rape, were more sensitive to osmotic pressure and oxidative stress and released more electrolytes compared with the sensitive isolates. Only in one lab mutant did we find a point mutation (V238A) in the SsOs1 gene of the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) signalling pathway. The expression of this gene was lost in the field resistant isolate HN456-1-JBJ and decreased in mycelium that was subjected to either high osmotic pressure or dimethachlone; however, another key gene in the HOG pathway, SsHog1, could be induced in the resistant isolate and mutants with NaCl treatment.CONCLUSIONThis study demonstrates that resistance to dicarboximide fungicide dimethachlone in S. sclerotiorum is emerging in China. Several fitness parameters, including mycelial growth rate, sclerotia formed in vitro, aggressiveness on leaves and osmotic and H2O2 sensitivity, indicate that the resistant strains may not effectively compete with sensitive isolates in the field in the absence of selection pressure. Lost expression or the V238A point mutation in the SsOs1 gene may confer resistance to dicarboximide fungicide dimethachlone in S. sclerotiorum, but this study illustrates that other, yet unknown mechanisms also exist.

This is the first report presenting that alpha-l-rhamnosidase showed activity on four kinds of glucosidic linkages. Compared with other previously characterized alpha-l-rhamnosidases, r-Rha1 showed a good thermostability and wide range of pH -stability with the optimum pH of 5.0 and temperature of 60 degrees C. r-Rha1 activity was not greatly affected by representative metal ions and other detected effectors and showed excellent tolerance abilities against glucose and ethanol. These beneficial characteristics of r-Rha1 suggest that r-Rha1 should be considered a potential new biocatalyst for food and drug industrial applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, the majority of this research has focused on children in middle school and on neurotypical youth, to the omission of people with disabilities. The current study, however, examines cyberbullying as it occurs among college students with and without disabilities. Two hundred five students completed a survey examining their experiences with cyberbullying, along with measures of predictor and outcome variables theorized to be related to cyberbullying. The results revealed that, as with traditional bullying, students with disabilities are at particular risk for cyberbullying victimization. Predictors of victimization included traditional bullying victimization, Internet use, and the noticeability of the disability. Outcomes of cyberbullying victimization (e.g., low self-esteem, high depression) appear to be particularly pronounced for individuals with disabilities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

For the validity of Bayesian analysis, it is essential to use priors that could lead to proper posterior distributions. Specifically, reference priors with partial information have been considered. A sufficient and necessary condition is established to guarantee the propriety of the posterior distribution under a general class of priors. The performance of the proposed approach is illustrated through extensive simulation studies and real data analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The performance of discriminating the irradiated shrimp samples at various irradiation doses using Multispectral Imaging (MSI) system (405-970 nm) and the effects on the textural properties were investigated in this study. Principal component analysis (PCA), least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM), and back propagation neural network (BPNN) methods were all applied to discriminate the irradiated shrimps at different irradiation doses. The classification accuracies from 76% to 100% were achieved by using LS-SVM and BPNN models. Comparatively, the LS-SVM model was proved to demonstrate the better performance with 100% prediction accuracy when using 10 kGy doses or above.

J	Grujicic, M.; Snipes, J. S.; Ramaswami, S.								The effect of fused-silica pre-shocking on its devitrification propensity and ballistic resistance: an all-atom molecular-level analysis								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE				51	7			3500	3512		10.1007/s10853-015-9670-0			APR 2016	2016	Recent studies have suggested that impact-induced devitrification of fused silica, or more specifically formation of high-density stishovite, can significantly improve ballistic-penetration resistance of fused silica, the material which is used in transparent armor. The studies have also shown that in order for stishovite to form during a ballistic-impact event, very high projectile kinetic energy normalized by the projectile/fused-silica target-plate contact area must accompany such an event. Otherwise fused-silica devitrification, if taking place, does not substantially improve the material ballistic-penetration resistance. In the present work, all-atom molecular-level computations are carried out in order to establish if pre-shocking of fused-silica target-plates (to form stishovite) and subsequent unloading (to revert stishovite to the material amorphous structure) can increase fused silica's propensity for stishovite formation during a ballistic impact. Towards that end, molecular-level computational procedures are developed to simulate both the pre-shocking treatment of the fused-silica target-plate and its subsequent impact by a solid right-circular cylindrical projectile. The results obtained clearly revealed that when strong-enough shockwaves are used in the fused-silica target-plate pre-shocking procedure, the propensity of fused silica for stishovite formation during the subsequent ballistic impact is increased, as is the associated ballistic-penetration resistance. To rationalize these findings, a detailed post-processing microstructural analysis of the pre-shocked material is employed. The results obtained suggest that fused silica pre-shocked with shockwaves of sufficient strength retain some memory/embryos of stishovite, and these embryos facilitate stishovite formation during the subsequent ballistic impact.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000368054100022

Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra revealed chemical shifts in H-3 and H-5 protons of beta CD, indicating EG inclusion into the lipophilic cavity of beta CD. In vitro assays showed beta CD-EG significantly inhibited P. litchii colony growth in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (MIC100 = 0.2 g). In vivo assays showed beta CD-EG significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the decay index of treated fresh litchi fruits. After exposure to beta CD-EG, the surface of P. litchii hyphae and/or sporangiophores became wrinkled, with folds and breakage observed by scanning electron microscopy. Damage to hyphal and/or sporangiophore cell walls and membrane structures post-treatment with beta CD-EG was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Therefore, beta CD-EG shows great potential as a controlled-release agent against P. litchii. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Effect of Postsynthesis Purifications on Gold and Silver Nanoparticle Ligand Coverage								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				120	12			6842	6850		10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b12423			MAR 31 2016	2016	Wet chemical nanoparticle synthesis is commonly employed because of the ability to tailor and control nanoparticle size, shape, polydispersity, and surface chemistry; however, excess ligands or free surfactants in the colloidal dispersion can be detrimental for many nanoparticle applications. Postsynthesis purification using antisolvent precipitation is a widely employed method to remove the excess ligands or precursors; however, there has been little in-depth fundamental investigation of the dynamics between the nanoparticle, ligand, and dispersing media as well as the morphology and fate of the nanoparticle and ligands during nanoparticle processing. In this paper, we investigate the changes in ligand surface coverage for dodecanethiol-stabilized gold and silver nanoparticles in response to repetitive antisolvent precipitation and redispersion using gas chromatography, thermogravimetric analysis, and small-angle neutron scattering. These techniques were each used to determine percent surface coverage and equilibrium ligand partitioning between the nanoparticle surface and bulk solution, which was then modeled with the Langmuir isotherm to determine the binding free energy. The binding free energy for dodecanethiol on 4.2 nm diameter gold nanoparticles was found to be -23 kJ/mol by gas chromatography (GC) and 34 kJ/mol by small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). The binding free energy for dodecanethiol on 7.7 nm diameter silver nanoparticles was found to be -21 kJ/mol by TGA and -29 kJ/mol by SANS. While these numbers demonstrate variability based on the method, they are comparable to literature values. Other notable results from this work demonstrate the optimization of the purification process and avoidance of using excess antisolvent which can lead to coprecipitation of the excess ligand with the nanoparticles, hindering the purification. Finally, multiple techniques for determining ligand binding free energy are demonstrated as well as evaluation of the pros and cons of each method.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1932-7447			WOS:000373416500063

Seeing the Forest through the Trees: Considering Roost-Site Selection at Multiple Spatial Scales								PLOS ONE				11	3					e0150011	10.1371/journal.pone.0150011			MAR 30 2016	2016	Conservation of bat species is one of the most daunting wildlife conservation challenges in North America, requiring detailed knowledge about their ecology to guide conservation efforts. Outside of the hibernating season, bats in temperate forest environments spend their diurnal time in day-roosts. In addition to simple shelter, summer roost availability is as critical as maternity sites and maintaining social group contact. To date, a major focus of bat conservation has concentrated on conserving individual roost sites, with comparatively less focus on the role that broader habitat conditions contribute towards roost-site selection. We evaluated roost-site selection by a northern population of federally-endangered Indiana bats (Myotis sodalis) at Fort Drum Military Installation in New York, USA at three different spatial scales: landscape, forest stand, and individual tree level. During 2007-2011, we radiotracked 33 Indiana bats (10 males, 23 females) and located 348 roosting events in 116 unique roost trees. At the landscape scale, bat roost-site selection was positively associated with northern mixed forest, increased slope, and greater distance from human development. At the stand scale, we observed subtle differences in roost site selection based on sex and season, but roost selection was generally positively associated with larger stands with a higher basal area, larger tree diameter, and a greater sugar maple (Acer saccharum) component. We observed no distinct trends of roosts being near high-quality foraging areas of water and forest edges. At the tree scale, roosts were typically in American elm (Ulmus americana) or sugar maple of large diameter (>30 cm) of moderate decay with loose bark. Collectively, our results highlight the importance of considering day roost needs simultaneously across multiple spatial scales. Size and decay class of individual roosts are key ecological attributes for the Indiana bat, however, larger-scale stand structural components that are products of past and current land use interacting with environmental aspects such as landform also are important factors influencing roost-tree selection patterns.									1	0	0	2	0	2			1932-6203			WOS:000373116500001	27028116

Consequently, it is important to properly calibrate this uncertainty prior to its application in the geotechnical analysis to ensure the integrity of the final design. The conventional probabilistic model calibration approaches, such as maximum likelihood estimate and Bayesian method, focus only on model fidelity (measured through, for example, likelihood). These approaches often yield models with a large model uncertainty, especially when the observed data are scattered. A large model uncertainty leads to a large variation in the model prediction, which poses a significant challenge in a geotechnical design. In this paper, we propose a new model calibration approach that can consider both model fidelity and model robustness. The new model calibration approach offers a way to balance the objectives of model fidelity and model robustness. Because model fidelity and model robustness are two conflicting objectives, the new approach involves a multi-objective optimization that leads to a Pareto front, which defines a tradeoff relationship between model fidelity and model robustness. By enforcing a certain level of robustness, the variation in the model prediction can be reduced, which overcomes the major weakness of the traditional probabilistic approaches that focus solely on model fidelity. The new approach is demonstrated through applications to the problems of liquefaction-induced settlement prediction. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The accuracy of a semi-empirical model developed in such a way may vary from one region to another, which has been seldom studied previously. Thus, in this paper, a probabilistic method is suggested to characterize the inter-region variability of the model bias factor of a semi-empirical model for liquefaction potential evaluation. As an illustration, the proposed approach is used to characterize the inter-region variability of the model bias factor of the Robertson and Wride model (called RW model for short herein). It is found that substantial inter-region variability exists in the model bias factor of the RW model. For a region not in the calibration database, the uncertainty associated with the model bias factor is significantly larger than that of a region in the calibration database. For regions in the calibration database, the uncertainty associated with the model bias factor in a region also changes with the amount and the type of the calibration data available in that region. It is thus important to collect region-specific performance data for model calibration to achieve accurate liquefaction potential evaluation. For ease of practical application, equations are provided for estimating the liquefaction probability based on the factor of safety (FOS) computed with the RW model for different regions. The suggested method can also be used to characterize the inter-region variability of other semi-empirical models and to derive region-specific relationships between FOS and liquefaction probability for these models.

The headpiece of the lac-repressor (LacI) protein is an ideal system for investigation of nonspecific binding of the whole LacI protein to DNA. The hinge region of the headpiece has been known to play a key role in the specific binding of LacI to DNA, whereas its role in nonspecific binding process has not been elucidated. Here, we report the results of explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulation and continuum electrostatic calculations suggesting that the hinge region strengthens the nonspecific interaction, accounting for up to 50% of the micro-dissociation free energy of LacI from DNA. Consequently, the rate of microscopic dissociation of LacI from DNA is reduced by 2 similar to 3 orders of magnitude in the absence of the hinge region. We find the hinge region makes an important contribution to the electrostatic energy, the salt dependence of electrostatic energy, and the number of salt ions excluded from binding of the LacI-DNA complex.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000372701200086

Accordingly, strategies against hIAPP aggregation are essential for the prevention and eventual treatment of the disease. Here, it is shown that generation-3 OH-terminated poly(amidoamine) dendrimer, a polymeric nanoparticle, can effectively halt the aggregation of hIAPP and shut down hIAPP toxicity in pancreatic MIN6 and NIT-1 cells as well as in mouse islets. This finding is supported by high-throughput dynamic light scattering experiment and thioflavin T assay, where the rapid evolution of hIAPP nucleation and elongation processes is halted by the addition of the dendrimer up to 8 h. Discrete molecular dynamics simulations further reveal that hIAPP residues bound strongly with the dendrimer near the c-terminal portion of the peptide, where the amyloidogenic sequence (residues 22-29) locates. Furthermore, simulations of hIAPP dimerization reveal that binding with the dendrimer significantly reduces formation of interpeptide contacts and hydrogen bonds, thereby prohibiting peptide self-association and amyloidosis. This study points to a promising nanomedicinal strategy for combating type-2 diabetes and may have broader implications for targeting neurological disorders whose distinct hallmark is also amyloid fibrillation.									3	0	0	1	0	3			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000373123100006	26808649

Controlling the conformation and dynamics of confined polymers is essential for realization of the full potential of polydots in nanomedicine and biotechnology. Specifically, the shape and internal dynamics of polydots that consist of highly rigid dialkyl p-phenylene ethynylene (PPE) are probed as a function of temperature. At room temperature, the polydots are spherical without any correlations between the aromatic rings on the PPE backbone. With increasing temperature, they expand and become slightly aspherical; however, the polymers remain confined. The coherent dynamic structure factor reveals that the internal motion of the polymer backbone is arrested, and the side chains dominate the internal dynamics of the polydots. These new soft nanoparticles retain their overall shape and dynamics over an extended temperature range, and their conformation is tunable via their degree of expansion.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0024-9297	1520-5835		WOS:000372856300046

Factors associated with Anaplasma spp. seroprevalence among dogs in the United States								PARASITES & VECTORS				9						169	10.1186/s13071-016-1431-7			MAR 22 2016	2016	Background: Dogs in the United States are hosts to a diverse range of ticks and tick-borne pathogens, including A. phagocytophilum, an important emerging canine and human pathogen. Previously, a Companion Animal Parasite Council (CAPC)-sponsored workshop proposed factors purported to be associated with the infection risk for tick-transmitted pathogens in dogs in the United States, including climate conditions, socioeconomic characteristics, local topography, and vector distribution.Methods: Approximately four million test results from routine veterinary diagnostic tests from 2011-2013, which were collected on a county level across the contiguous United States, are statistically analyzed with the proposed factors via logistic regression and generalized estimating equations. Spatial prevalence maps of baseline Anaplasma spp. prevalence are constructed from Kriging and head-banging smoothing methods.Results: All of the examined factors, with the exception of surface water coverage, were significantly associated with Anaplasma spp. prevalence. Overall, Anaplasma spp. prevalence increases with increasing precipitation and forestation coverage and decreases with increasing temperature, population density, relative humidity, and elevation. Interestingly, socioeconomic status and deer/vehicle collisions were positively and negatively correlated with canine Anaplasma seroprevalence, respectively. A spatial map of the canine Anaplasma hazard is an auxiliary product of the analysis. Anaplasma spp. prevalence is highest in New England and the Upper Midwest.Conclusions: The results from the two posited statistical models (one that contains an endemic areas assumption and one that does not) are in general agreement, with the major difference being that the endemic areas model estimates a larger prevalence in Western Texas, New Mexico, and Colorado. As A. phagocytophilum is zoonotic, the results of this analysis could also help predict areas of high risk for human exposure to this pathogen.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1756-3305			WOS:000372578600003	27004557

Massive physiological changes occur that lead to the shut down of photosynthesis and a cessation of growth. Leaf senescence involves the selective destruction of the chloroplast as the site of photosynthesis. Here, we show that 13-lipoxygenase (13-LOX) accomplishes a key role in the destruction of chloroplasts in senescing plants and propose a critical role of its NH2-terminal chloroplast transit peptide. The 13-LOX enzyme identified here accumulated in the plastid envelope and catalyzed the dioxygenation of unsaturated membrane fatty acids, leading to a selective destruction of the chloroplast and the release of stromal constituents. Because 13-LOX pathway products comprise compounds involved in insect deterrence and pathogen defense (volatile aldehydes and oxylipins), a mechanism of unmolested nitrogen and carbon relocation is suggested that occurs from leaves to seeds and roots during fall.									4	0	0	2	0	4			0027-8424			WOS:000372488200071	26969728

By observing simultaneously in the near-infrared to hard X-ray band, we can well characterize the high end of the synchrotron component of the SED. Thus, fitting the SEDs to synchro-Compton models of the dominant emission from the relativistic jet, we can constrain the underlying particle properties and predict the shape of the gigaelectronvolt Compton component. Standard extragalactic background light (EBL) models explain the high-energy absorption well, with poorer fits for high-ultraviolet models. The fits show clear evidence for EBL absorption in the Fermi spectrum of our highest-redshift source 3FGL J0630.9-2406. While synchrotron self-Compton models adequately describe the SEDs, the situation may be complicated by possible external Compton components. For 3FGL J0811.2-7529, we also discover a nearby serendipitous source in the X-ray data, which is almost certainly another lower synchrotron peak frequency (nu(sy)(pk)) BL Lac, that may contribute flux in the Fermi band. Since our sources are unusual high-luminosity, moderate nu(sy)(pk) BL Lacs, we compare these quantities and the Compton dominance, the ratio of peak inverse Compton to peak synchrotron luminosities (L-pk(IC)/L-pk(sy)), with those of the full Fermi BL Lac population.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000372787000071

ACS synthetic biology				5	3			213	23		10.1021/acssynbio.5b00100			2016-Mar-18	2016	Eukaryotic promoters have a complex architecture to control both the strength and timing of gene transcription spanning up to thousands of bases from the initiation site. This complexity makes rational fine-tuning of promoters in fungi difficult to predict; however, this very same complexity enables multiple possible strategies for engineering promoter strength. Here, we studied promoter architecture in the oleaginous yeast, Yarrowia lipolytica. While recent studies have focused on upstream activating sequences, we systematically examined various components common in fungal promoters. Here, we examine several promoter components including upstream activating sequences, proximal promoter sequences, core promoters, and the TATA box in autonomously replicating expression plasmids and integrated into the genome. Our findings show that promoter strength can be fine-tuned through the engineering of the TATA box sequence, core promoter, and upstream activating sequences. Additionally, we identified a previously unreported oleic acid responsive transcription enhancement in the XPR2 upstream activating sequences, which illustrates the complexity of fungal promoters. The promoters engineered here provide new genetic tools for metabolic engineering in Y. lipolytica and provide promoter engineering strategies that may be useful in engineering other non-model fungal systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0				2161-5063		MEDLINE:26635071	26635071

Because the electrostatic forces that guide binding act over large distances, truncating the size of the system to facilitate computational modeling frequently yields inaccurate results. Our multiscale approach implements a computational focusing method that permits computation of large systems without truncating the electrostatic potential and achieves the high resolution required for modeling macromolecular interactions, all while keeping the computational time reasonable. We tested our approach on the motility of various kinesin motor domains. We found that electrostatics help guide kinesins as they walk: N-kinesins towards the plus-end, and C-kinesins towards the minus-end of microtubules. Our methodology enables computation in similar, large systems including protein binding to DNA, viruses, and membranes.									1	0	0	1	0	1			2045-2322			WOS:000372468400001	26988596

The comparison between the values of lambda extracted from existing data on the Debye-Waller factor for various metal surfaces and the lambda values known from literature indicates a substantial agreement, which opens the possibility of directly extracting the electron-phonon coupling strength in quasi-2D conducting systems from the temperature or incident energy dependence of the elastic helium atom scattering intensities.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1948-7185			WOS:000372561900012	26927966	
J	Roser, Philipp								Quantum mechanics on York slices								CLASSICAL AND QUANTUM GRAVITY				33	6					065001	10.1088/0264-9381/33/6/065001			MAR 17 2016	2016	For some time the York time parameter has been identified as a candidate for a physically meaningful time in cosmology. An associated Hamiltonian may be found by solving the Hamiltonian constraint for the momentum conjugate to the York time variable, although an explicit solution can only be found in highly symmetric cases. The Poisson structure of the remaining variables is not canonical. Here we quantise this dynamics in an anisotropic minisuperspace model via a natural extension of canonical quantisation. The resulting quantum theory has no momentum representation. Instead the position basis takes a fundamental role. We illustrate how the quantum theory and the modified representation of its momentum operators lead to a consistent theory in the presence of the constraints that arose during the Hamiltonian reduction. The quantised reduced Hamiltonian is Hermitian, although the momentum operators are not, the causes and implications of which we discuss. We are able to solve for the eigenspectrum of the Hamiltonian. Finally we discuss how far the results of this model extend to the general non-homogeneous case, in particular perturbation theory with York time.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0264-9381	1361-6382		WOS:000370601100002

Here, we elucidated water dynamics in Asp-His-Thr-Lys-Glu (DHTKE), an antioxidant peptide derived from egg white ovalbumin, using water dynamic vapor sorption (DVS) and low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR). The DVS results indicated that parallel exponential kinetics model fitted well to the data of sorption kinetics behavior of DHTKE. Four different proton fractions with different mobilities were identified based on the degree of interaction between peptide and water. The water could significantly change the proton distribution and structure of the sample. The different phases of moisture absorption were reflected in the T-2 parameters. In addition, the combined water content was dominant in the hygroscopicity of DHTKE. This study provides an effective real-time monitoring method for water mobility and distribution in synthetic peptides, and this method may have applications in promoting peptide quality assurance.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0021-8561	1520-5118		WOS:000372478300015	26915514

The resistivity of the pyrolyzed papers was initially used as screening parameters to select the best three paper samples (imaging card paper, multipurpose printing paper, and 3MM chromatography paper) and assemble working electrodes that were further characterized by a combination of microscopy, electrochemistry, and spectroscopy. Although slight differences in performance were observed, all carbon substrates fabricated from pyrolysis of paper allowed the development of competitive biosensors for uric acid. The presented results demonstrate the potential of these electrodes for sensing applications and highlight the potential advantages of 3MM chromatography paper as a substrate to fabricate electrodes by pyrolysis.

The Brillouin gain coefficient was found to be 0.11 x 10(-11) m/W, which is about 20 x lower than conventional silica glass optical fibers. The SrAlSi core fiber also has a near-zero temperature coefficient of Brillouin frequency shift (-0.064 MHz/K) and can be considered athermal for all intents and purposes. Additional physical and Brillouin properties of the individual glass components are deduced through the use of an additive model. As a highlight, strontia (SrO) is found to have a large negative Pockels photoelastic coefficient of p(12) = - 0.245. Various other bulk properties, such as the acoustic velocity, refractive index, mass density, thermo-optic, and thermo-acoustic, as well as strain-optic and strain-acoustic coefficients are provided.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0733-8724	1558-2213		WOS:000374018500001

The dynamic adsorption data was fit to various isotherm models to assess the possible mode of rSPA-PP fiber adsorption. Among them, the Langmuir-linear model fit the experimental data best, suggesting a two-stage mechanism of adsorption. The first stage involves the formation of a monolayer coverage, which follows the Langmuir isotherm. When the adsorbate concentration increases, solute starts to adsorb onto the already adsorbed layer, following a linear adsorption response. The relationship between the rSPA loading and flow rate and column length was also investigated. These two parameters are related through the residence time of rSPA in the column. It was determined that loading at the flow rate of 0.5 mL min(-1) (similar to 28 mm s(-1)) with a 1 x 10(-5) M (0.5 mg mL(-1)) rSPA feed concentration on a 30-cm (0.762 mm i.d.) column could conveniently produce a reasonable binding capacity of rSPA on PP surface within only 6 min. Under those conditions, the rSPA binding at 50% breakthrough was found to be similar to 2.1 mg g(-1) fiber. Operation of the rSPA-modified columns across ten complete processing cycles using clean-in-place conditions (including urea, guanidine HCl, and NaOH) commonly used in the bioprocessing industry allows assessment of the robustness of the rSPA capture layers. In all cases, the robustness was quite good, with the relative responses providing insights to the rSPA/PP surface structure. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In order to better understand potential genetic divergence underlying this variable risk, we studied genes responsible for monogenic IDs, grouped according to their autism and epilepsy comorbidities.Methods: Utilizing 465 different forms of ID with known molecular origins, we accessed available genetic databases in conjunction with gene ontology (GO) to determine whether the genetics underlying ID diverge according to its comorbidities with autism and epilepsy and if genes highly penetrant for autism or epilepsy share distinctive features that set them apart from genes that confer comparatively variable or no apparent risk.Results: The genetics of ID with autism are relatively enriched in terms associated with nervous system-specific processes and structural morphogenesis. In contrast, we find that ID with highly comorbid epilepsy (HCE) is modestly associated with lipid metabolic processes while ID without autism or epilepsy comorbidity (ID only) is enriched at the Golgi membrane. Highly comorbid autism (HCA) genes, on the other hand, are strongly enriched within the nucleus, are typically involved in regulation of gene expression, and, along with IDs with more variable autism, share strong ties with a core protein-protein interaction (PPI) network integral to basic patterning of the CNS.Conclusions: According to GO terminology, autism-related gene products are integral to neural development. While it is difficult to draw firm conclusions regarding IDs unassociated with autism, it is clear that the majority of HCA genes are tightly linked with general dysregulation of gene expression, suggesting that disturbances to the chronology of neural maturation and patterning may be key in conferring susceptibility to autism spectrum conditions.									1	0	0	1	0	1			2040-2392			WOS:000372794600001	26985359

Potential for Integrating Diffusion of Innovation Principles into Life Cycle Assessment of Emerging Technologies								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				50	6			2771	2781		10.1021/acs.est.5b03239			MAR 15 2016	2016	Life cycle assessment (LCA) measures cradle to-grave environmental impacts of a product. To assess impacts of an emerging technology, LCA should be coupled with additional methods that estimate how that technology might be deployed. The extent and manner that an emerging technology diffuses throughout a region shapes the magnitude and type of environmental impacts. Diffusion of innovation is an established field of research that analyzes the adoption of new innovations, and its principles can be used to construct scenario models that enhance LCA of emerging technologies. Integrating diffusion modeling techniques with an LCA of emerging technology can provide estimates for the extent of market penetration, the displacement of existing systems, and the rate of adoption. Two general perspectives of application are macro-level diffusion models that use a function of time to represent adoption, and microlevel diffusion models that simulate adoption through interactions of individuals. Incorporating diffusion of innovation concepts complement existing methods within LCA to inform proactive environmental management of emerging technologies.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000372392100006	26820700

Triggered self-assembly of magnetic nanoparticles								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				6						23145	10.1038/srep23145			MAR 15 2016	2016	Colloidal magnetic nanoparticles are candidates for application in biology, medicine and nanomanufacturing. Understanding how these particles interact collectively in fluids, especially how they assemble and aggregate under external magnetic fields, is critical for high quality, safe, and reliable deployment of these particles. Here, by applying magnetic forces that vary strongly over the same length scale as the colloidal stabilizing force and then varying this colloidal repulsion, we can trigger self-assembly of these nanoparticles into parallel line patterns on the surface of a disk drive medium. Localized within nanometers of the medium surface, this effect is strongly dependent on the ionic properties of the colloidal fluid but at a level too small to cause bulk colloidal aggregation. We use real-time optical diffraction to monitor the dynamics of self-assembly, detecting local colloidal changes with greatly enhanced sensitivity compared with conventional light scattering. Simulations predict the triggering but not the dynamics, especially at short measurement times. Beyond using spatially-varying magnetic forces to balance interactions and drive assembly in magnetic nanoparticles, future measurements leveraging the sensitivity of this approach could identify novel colloidal effects that impact real-world applications of these nanoparticles.									2	0	0	0	0	2			2045-2322			WOS:000372054900001	26975332

We describe the convex hull of this n-dimensional set with O(n) facets. We also establish a distributive property by proving that the convex hull of <=- and >=-type superincreasing knapsacks can be obtained by intersecting the convex hulls of <=- and >=-sets taken individually.

Our analysis of the region reveals low-significance residual structures within the virial radius of the cluster that are too faint for a detailed investigation with the current data. Using a likelihood approach that is free of assumptions on the spectral shape we derive upper limits on the gamma-ray flux that is expected from energetic particle interactions in the cluster. We also consider a benchmark spatial and spectral template motivated by models in which the observed radio halo is mostly emission by secondary electrons. In this case, the median expected and observed upper limits for the flux above 100MeV are 1.7 x 10(-9) ph cm(-2) s(-1) and 5.2 x 10(-9) ph cm(-2) s(-1) respectively (the latter corresponds to residual emission at the level of 1.8 sigma). These bounds are comparable to or higher than predicted levels of hadronic gamma-ray emission in cosmic-ray (CR) models with or without reacceleration of secondary electrons, although direct comparisons are sensitive to assumptions regarding the origin and propagation mode of CRs and magnetic field properties. The minimal expected.-ray flux from radio and star-forming galaxies within the Coma cluster is roughly an order of magnitude below the median sensitivity of our analysis.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000372305700061

Earlier Fermi Large Area Telescope results reported the detection of.-ray emission coincident with the position of RCW 86 but its origin (leptonic or hadronic) remained unclear due to the poor statistics. Thanks to 6.5 years of data acquired by the Fermi-LAT and the new event reconstruction Pass 8, we report the significant detection of spatially extended emission coming from RCW 86. The spectrum is described by a power-law function with a very hard photon index (Gamma= 1.42 +/- 0.1(stat) +/- 0.06(syst)) in the 0.1-500 GeV range and an energy flux above 100 MeV of (2.91. 0.8(stat). 0.12(syst)) 10-11 erg cm(-2) s(-1). Gathering all the available multiwavelength (MWL) data, we perform a broadband modeling of the nonthermal emission of RCW 86 to constrain parameters of the nearby medium and bring new hints about the origin of the gamma-ray emission. For the whole SNR, the modeling favors a leptonic scenario in the framework of a two-zone model with an average magnetic field of 10.2 +/- 0.7 mu G and a limit on the maximum energy injected into protons of 2. x. 10(49) erg for a density of 1 cm(-3). In addition, parameter values are derived for the north-east and south-west (SW) regions of RCW 86, providing the first indication of a higher magnetic field in the SW region.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000372305700010

(VHE).-ray bands. NuSTAR yielded previously unattainable sensitivity in the 3-79. keV range, revealing that the spectrum softens when the source is dimmer until the X-ray spectral shape saturates into a steep Gamma approximate to 3 power law, with no evidence for an exponential cutoff or additional hard components up to similar to 80. keV. For the first time, we observed both the synchrotron and the inverse-Compton peaks of the spectral energy distribution (SED) simultaneously shifted to frequencies below the typical quiescent state by an order of magnitude. The fractional variability as a function of photon energy shows a double-bump structure that relates to the two bumps of the broadband SED. In each bump, the variability increases with energy, which, in the framework of the synchrotron self-Compton model, implies that the electrons with higher energies are more variable. The measured multi band variability, the significant X-ray-to-VHE correlation down to some of the lowest fluxes ever observed in both bands, the lack of correlation between optical/UV and X-ray flux, the low degree of polarization and its significant (random) variations, the short estimated electron cooling time, and the significantly longer variability timescale observed in the NuSTAR light curves point toward in situ electron acceleration and suggest that there are multiple compact regions contributing to the broadband emission of Mrk 421 during low-activity states.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000372305700068		
J	Baeza, J. Antonio					Baeza, Juan Antonio/0000-0002-2573-6773			Molecular phylogeny of porcelain crabs (Porcellanidae: Petrolisthes and allies) from the south eastern Pacific: the genera Allopetrolisthes and Liopetrolisthes are not natural entities								PEERJ				4						e1805	10.7717/peerj.1805			MAR 10 2016	2016	Porcelain crabs from the closely related genera Petrolisthes, Liopetrolisthes, and Allopetrolisthes are known for their diversity of lifestyles, habitats, and coloration. The evolutionary relationships among the species belonging to these three genera is not fully resolved. A molecular phylogeny of the group may help to resolve the long-standing taxonomic question about the validity of the genera Allopetrohsthes and Liopetrolisthes. Using both 'total evidence' and single-marker analyses based on a 362-bp alignment of the 16S rRNA mitochondrial DNA and a 328-bp alignment of the Histone 3 nuclear DNA, the phylogenetic relationships among 11 species from Petrolisthes (6 species), Liopetrolisthes (2 species), and Allopetrolisthes (3 species), all native to the south eastern Pacific, were examined. The analyses supported three pairs of sister species: L. mitra + L. patagonicus, P. tuberculatus + P. tuberculosus, and A. angulosus + A. punctatus. No complete segregation of species, according to genera, was evident from tree topologies. Bayesian-factor analyses revealed strong support for the unconstrained tree instead of an alternative tree in which monophyly of the three genera was forced. Thus, the present molecular phylogeny does not support the separation of the species within this complex into the genera Petrohsthes, Liopetrolisthes, and Allopetrolisthes. Taking into account the above and other recent molecular phylogenetic analyses focused on other representatives from the family Porcellanidae, it is tentatively proposed to eliminate the genera Liopetrolisthes and Allopetrohsthes, and to transfer their members to the genus Petrolisthes.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2167-8359			WOS:000372142200015	26989636

Several studies using taurine breeds showed the existence of genetic variability and thus the possibility of genetic improvement of the fatty acid profile in beef. This study identified the regions of the genome associated with saturated, mono-and polyunsaturated fatty acids, and n-6 to n-3 ratios in the Longissimus thoracis of Nellore finished in feedlot, using the single-step method.Results: The results showed that 115 windows explain more than 1 % of the additive genetic variance for the 22 studied fatty acids. Thirty-one genomic regions that explain more than 1 % of the additive genetic variance were observed for total saturated fatty acids, C12:0, C14:0, C16:0 and C18:0. Nineteen genomic regions, distributed in sixteen different chromosomes accounted for more than 1 % of the additive genetic variance for the monounsaturated fatty acids, such as the sum of monounsaturated fatty acids, C14:1 cis-9, C18:1 trans-11, C18:1 cis-9, and C18:1 trans-9. Forty genomic regions explained more than 1 % of the additive variance for the polyunsaturated fatty acids group, which are related to the total polyunsaturated fatty acids, C20:4 n-6, C18:2 cis-9 cis12 n-6, C18:3 n-3, C18:3 n-6, C22:6 n-3 and C20:3 n-6 cis-8 cis-11 cis-14. Twenty-one genomic regions accounted for more than 1 % of the genetic variance for the group of omega-3, omega-6 and the n-6:n-3 ratio.Conclusions: The identification of such regions and the respective candidate genes, such as ELOVL5, ESSRG, PCYT1A and genes of the ABC group (ABC5, ABC6 and ABC10), should contribute to form a genetic basis of the fatty acid profile of Nellore (Bos indicus) beef, contributing to better selection of the traits associated with improving human health.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1471-2164			WOS:000371595800008	26960694

Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) were used to determine the pattern of invasion and to quantify landscape metrics. Sericea lespedeza was distributed on both sides of the lake in Pacolet and Madison soil map units (Fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kanhapludults) on average slopes of 17.5%. It was common along roads and trails with a preferred mean canopy cover of <50%. Plant tissue analysis revealed statistically higher concentrations of macronutrients nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca) and sulfur (S) and selected micronutrients in leaves compared to stems and roots. Micronutrients copper (Cu), manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) were significantly higher in stems and roots. Soil analysis results showed no statistical difference between control and invaded plots for measured soil chemistry parameters.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0010-3624	1532-2416		WOS:000372909300009

Magnonics: Selective heat production in nanocomposites with different magnetic nanoparticles								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS				119	9					095106	10.1063/1.4943067			MAR 7 2016	2016	We theoretically study Ferromagnetic Resonance (FMR) in nanocomposites focusing on the analysis of heat production. It is demonstrated that at the FMR frequency, the temperature of nanoparticles can be raised at the rate of a few degrees per second at the electromagnetic (EM) irradiation power equivalent to the sunlight power. Thus, using FMR, one can initiate either surface or bulk reaction in the vicinity of a particular magnetic inclusion by purposely delivering heat to the nanoscale at a sufficiently fast rate. We examined the FMR features in (a) the film with a mixture of nanoparticles made of different materials; (b) the laminated films where each layer is filled with a particular type of magnetic nanoparticles. It is shown that different nanoparticles can be selectively heated at the different bands of EM spectrum. This effect opens up new exciting opportunities to control the microwave assisted chemical reactions depending on the heating rate.

Engaging youth of color in applied science education and public health promotion								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION				38	4			688	699		10.1080/09500693.2015.1134850			MAR 3 2016	2016	Participation in inquiry-based science education, which focuses on student-constructed learning, has been linked to academic success. Whereas the benefits of this type of science education are evident, access to such high-quality science curriculum and programming is not equitable. Black and Latino students in particular have less access to supplementary science programming, and fewer opportunities to engage in inquiry-based education. This paper describes outcomes associated with an inquiry-based out-of-school time science education program, Nuestro Futuro: Applied Science Education to Engage Black and Latino Youth (NFASE), which sought to build the capacity of middle school students of color to 'think' like health scientists from diverse disciplinary perspectives. The program was designed with the intent of (1) improving student attitudes toward and motivation for science and (2) increasing active and engaged citizenship (AEC). NFASE students explored health inequity and the social determinants of health locally and engaged in developing health promotion, outreach and education efforts targeted to their peers, parents/families, and community. Interest in the program was high overall, but implementation was not without challenges. Although evaluation outcomes indicate that there were no statistically significant changes in science-related attitudes or motivation, students reported significant increases in neighborhood social connection, as well as overall AEC.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0950-0693	1464-5289		WOS:000373292900007

PLoS ONE				11	3			e0149797	e0149797					Mar 2 2016	2016	Theory predicts that monogamy is adaptive in resource-specialist symbiotic crustaceans inhabiting relatively small and morphologically simple hosts in tropical environments where predation risk away from hosts is high. We tested this prediction in Pontonia manningi, a hyper-symbiotic shrimp that dwells in the mantle cavity of the Atlantic winged oyster Pteria colymbus that, in turn, infects gorgonians from the genus Pseudopterogorgia in the Caribbean Sea. In agreement with theory, P. manningi were found dwelling as heterosexual pairs in oysters more frequently than expected by chance alone. Males and females also inhabited the same host individual independent of the female gravid condition or of the developmental stage of brooded embryos. While the observations above argue in favor of monogamy in P. manningi, there is evidence to suggest that males of the studied species are moderately promiscuous. That females found living solitary in oysters most often brooded embryos, and that males allocated more to weaponry (major claw size) than females at any given size suggest that males might be roaming among host individuals in search of and, fighting for, receptive females. All available information depicts a rather complex mating system in P. manningi: primarily monogamous but with moderately promiscuous males.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			ZOOREC:ZOOR15206035202

Relative Contributions of Prenylation and Postprenylation Processing in Cryptococcus neoformans Pathogenesis								MSPHERE				1	2					UNSP e00084-15	10.1128/mSphere.00084-15			MAR-APR 2016	2016	Prenyltransferase enzymes promote the membrane localization of their target proteins by directing the attachment of a hydrophobic lipid group at a conserved C-terminal CAAX motif. Subsequently, the prenylated protein is further modified by postprenylation processing enzymes that cleave the terminal 3 amino acids and carboxymethylate the prenylated cysteine residue. Many prenylated proteins, including Ras1 and Ras-like proteins, require this multistep membrane localization process in order to function properly. In the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, previous studies have demonstrated that two distinct forms of protein prenylation, farnesylation and geranylgeranylation, are both required for cellular adaptation to stress, as well as full virulence in animal infection models. Here, we establish that the C. neoformans RAM1 gene encoding the farnesyltransferase beta-subunit, though not strictly essential for growth under permissive in vitro conditions, is absolutely required for cryptococcal pathogenesis. We also identify and characterize postprenylation protease and carboxyl methyltransferase enzymes in C. neoformans. In contrast to the prenyltransferases, deletion of the genes encoding the Rce1 protease and Ste14 carboxyl methyltransferase results in subtle defects in stress response and only partial reductions in virulence. These postprenylation modifications, as well as the prenylation events themselves, do play important roles in mating and hyphal transitions, likely due to their regulation of peptide pheromones and other proteins involved in development.IMPORTANCE Cryptococcus neoformans is an important human fungal pathogen that causes disease and death in immunocompromised individuals. The growth and morphogenesis of this fungus are controlled by conserved Ras-like GTPases, which are also important for its pathogenicity. Many of these proteins require proper subcellular localization for full function, and they are directed to cellular membranes through a posttranslational modification process known as prenylation. These studies investigate the roles of one of the prenylation enzymes, farnesyltransferase, as well as the postprenylation processing enzymes in C. neoformans. We demonstrate that the postprenylation processing steps are dispensable for the localization of certain substrate proteins. However, both protein farnesylation and the subsequent postprenylation processing steps are required for full pathogenesis of this fungus.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2379-5042			WOS:000392584700024

Hybrid Dynamic-Empirical Building Energy Modeling Approach for an Existing Campus Building								JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL ENGINEERING				22	1					04015010	10.1061/(ASCE)AE.1943-5568.0000183			MAR 2016	2016	A hybrid modeling framework was constructed to investigate the uncertainty in modeling the energy consumption of an existing campus building with minimal instrumentation. The hybrid framework consisted of a dynamic model of the building's conditioned spaces, coupled with an empirical model of the building's HVAC system. The empirical model was calibrated using linear regression of available HVAC system temperature and flow measurements from a building automation system to develop estimates of internal loads and relationships between envelope heat gains/losses and indoor/outdoor temperatures. Crabtree Hall, a 40-year-old building at the University of Pittsburgh, was used as an illustrative case study for this approach. A separate data collection time frame was used for empirical model verification in addition to the initial model development time frame. Comparative results from the model showed a 20% normalized RMS deviation for hourly net heating and cooling for the average day in a given month. This close agreement highlights the possibilities of this approach for rapid assessment of energy consumption and retrofit potential in existing buildings. Future work will include additional refinement of the components of energy consumption using mobile equipment to collect targeted measurements at additional locations, as well as cross-checking existing measurement locations. Additional future work should include extending this method to buildings with more complex HVAC systems, such as variable-air-volume systems and multiple thermal zones, to further verify and improve its robustness.

Conformation of ionizable poly Para phenylene ethynylene in dilute solutions								JOURNAL OF POLYMER SCIENCE PART B-POLYMER PHYSICS				54	5			582	588		10.1002/polb.23949			MAR 1 2016	2016	The conformation of dinonyl poly para phenylene ethynylenes (PPEs) with carboxylate side chains, equilibrated in solvents of different quality have been studied using molecular dynamics simulations. PPEs are of interest because of their tunable electro-optical properties, chemical diversity, and functionality which are essential in wide range of applications. The polymer conformation determines the conjugation length and their assembly mode and affects electro-optical properties which are critical in current and potential uses. This study investigates the effect of carboxylate fraction on PPEs side chains on the conformation of chains in the dilute limit, in solvents of different quality. The dinonyl PPE chains are modeled atomistically, where the solvents are modeled both implicitly and explicitly. Dinonyl PPEs maintained a stretched out conformation up to a carboxylate fraction f of 0.7 in all solvents studied. The nonyl side chains are extended and oriented away from the PPE backbone in toluene and in implicit good solvent, whereas in water and implicit poor solvent, the nonyl side chains are collapsed toward the PPE backbone. Rotation around the aromatic ring is fast and no long range correlations are seen within the backbone. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part B: Polym.

BLACK AND WHITE FERTILITY, DIFFERENTIAL BABY BOOMS: THE VALUE OF EQUAL EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY								JOURNAL OF DEMOGRAPHIC ECONOMICS				82	1			27	109		10.1017/dem.2015.17			MAR 2016	2016	This paper produces new estimates for white and black mortality and fertility at the state level from 1800(20)-2000. It produces new estimates of black and white schooling for this same period. Using a calibrated model of black and white parents, we fit the time series of black and white fertility and schooling. We then produce estimates of the benefits of equal education opportunity for blacks over the period 1820-2000. For the better part of US history, blacks have suffered from less access to schooling for their children than whites. This paper quantifies the magnitude of this discrimination. Our estimates of the welfare cost of this discrimination prior to the Civil War range between 0.5 and 20 times black wealth, and between 0.5 and 10 times black wealth prior to 1960. Further we find that the Civil Rights era was valued by blacks in the South by between 1% to 2% of wealth. Outside of the South, we find significant costs of discrimination prior to 1960, ranging from 6% to 150% of black wealth. For these divisions from 1960-2000, blacks have attained rough parity in schooling access. The welfare magnitudes are similar to the hypothetical gains to blacks if they had white mortality rates. We show that the model's black and white human capital series are strongly, positively correlated with state output measures, black and white permanent incomes and black and white earnings.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2054-0892	2054-0906		WOS:000378172800002

We have enhanced our previously published microarray-based gene atlas of maize (Zea mays L.) inbred B73 to now include 79 distinct replicated samples that have been interrogated using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The current version of the atlas includes 50 original array-based gene atlas samples, a time-course of 12 stalk and leaf samples postflowering, and an additional set of 17 samples from the maize seedling and adult root system. The entire dataset contains 4.6 billion mapped reads, with an average of 20.5 million mapped reads per biological replicate, allowing for detection of genes with lower transcript abundance. As the new root samples represent key additions to the previously examined tissues, we highlight insights into the root transcriptome, which is represented by 28,894 (73.2%) annotated genes in maize. Additionally, we observed remarkable expression differences across both the longitudinal (four zones) and radial gradients (cortical parenchyma and stele) of the primary root supported by fourfold differential expression of 9353 and 4728 genes, respectively. Among the latter were 1110 genes that encode transcription factors, some of which are orthologs of previously characterized transcription factors known to regulate root development in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh., while most are novel, and represent attractive targets for reverse genetics approaches to determine their roles in this important organ. This comprehensive transcriptome dataset is a powerful tool toward understanding maize development, physiology, and phenotypic diversity.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1940-3372			WOS:000378146900004

Wild watermelon relatives (Citrullus lanatus var. citroides) have been shown in greenhouse studies to possess varying degrees of resistance to RKN species. Experiments were conducted over 2 yr to assess resistance of southern RKN in C. lanatus var. citroides accessions from the U.S. Watermelon Plant Introduction Collection in an artificially infested field site at the U.S. Vegetable Laboratory in Charleston, SC. In the first study (2006), 19 accessions of C. lanatus var. citroides were compared with reference entries of Citrullus colocynthis and C. lanatus var. lanatus. Of the wild watermelon accessions, two entries exhibited significantly less galling than all other entries. Five of the best performing C. lanatus var. citroides accessions were evaluated with and without nematicide at the same field site in 2007. Citrullus lanatus var. citroides accessions performed better than C. lanatus var. lanatus and C. colocynthis. Overall, most entries of C. lanatus var. citroides performed similarly with and without nematicide treatment in regard to root galling, visible egg masses, vine vigor, and root mass. In both years of field evaluations, most C. lanatus var. citroides accessions showed lesser degrees of nematode reproduction and higher vigor and root mass than C. colocynthis and C. lanatus var. lanatus. The results of these two field evaluations suggest that wild watermelon populations may be useful sources of resistance to southern RKN.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-300X			WOS:000376117100004	27168648	
J	Lankton, Nancy K.; McKnight, D. Harrison; Wright, Ryan T.; Thatcher, Jason Bennett								Using Expectation Disconfirmation Theory and Polynomial Modeling to Understand Trust in Technology								INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH				27	1			197	213		10.1287/isre.2015.0611			MAR 2016	2016	Trust in technology is an emerging research domain that examines trust in the technology artifact instead of trust in people. Although previous research finds that trust in technology can predict important outcomes, little research has examined the effect of unmet trust in technology expectations on trusting intentions. Furthermore, both trust and expectation disconfirmation theories suggest that trust disconfirmation effects may be more complex than the linear expectation disconfirmation model depicts. However, this complexity may only exist under certain contextual conditions. The current study contributes to this literature by introducing a nonlinear expectation disconfirmation theory model that extends understanding of trust-in-technology expectations and disconfirmation. Not only does the model include both technology trust expectations and technology trusting intention, it also introduces the concept of expectation maturity as a contextual factor. We collected data from three technology usage contexts that differ in expectation maturity, which we operationalize as length of the introductory period. We find that the situation, in terms of expectation maturity, consistently matters. Using polynomial regression and response surface analyses, we find that in contexts with a longer introductory period (i.e., higher expectation maturity), disconfirmation has a nonlinear relationship with trusting intention. When the introductory period is shorter (i.e., expectation maturity is lower), disconfirmation has a linear relationship with trusting intention. This unique set of empirical findings shows when it is valuable to use nonlinear modeling for understanding technology trust disconfirmation. We conclude with implications for future research.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1047-7047	1526-5536		WOS:000375600200012		
J	Baye, Michael R.; De los Santos, Babur; Wildenbeest, Matthijs R.								SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION: WHAT DRIVES ORGANIC TRAFFIC TO RETAIL SITES?								JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS & MANAGEMENT STRATEGY				25	1			6	31					SPR 2016	2016	The lion's share of retail traffic through search engines originates from organic (natural) rather than sponsored (paid) links. We use a dataset constructed from over 12,000 search terms and 2million users to identify drivers of the organic clicks that the top 759 retailers received from search engines in August 2012. Our results are potentially important for search engine optimization (SEO). We find that a retailer's investments in factors such as the quality and brand awareness of its site increases organic clicks through both a direct and an indirect effect. The direct effect stems purely from consumer behavior: The higher the quality of an online retailer, the greater the number of consumers who click its link rather than a competitor in the list of organic results. The indirect effect stems from our finding that search engines tend to place higher quality sites in better positions, which results in additional clicks because consumers tend to click links in more favorable positions. We also find that consumers who are older, wealthier, conduct searches from work, use fewer words, or include a brand name product in their search are more likely to click a retailer's organic link following a product search. Finally, the quality of a retailer's site appears to be especially important in attracting organic traffic from individuals with higher incomes. The beneficial direct and indirect effects of an online retailer's brand equity on organic clicks, coupled with the spillover effects on traffic through other online and traditional channels, leads us to conclude that investments in the quality and brand awareness of a site should be included as part of an SEO strategy.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1058-6407	1530-9134		WOS:000374500800002

Polishing Step Purification of High-Strength Wastewaters by Nanofiltration and Reverse Osmosis								MEMBRANES				6	1						10.3390/membranes6010019			MAR 2016	2016	This article reports findings on the use of nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) for secondary treatment of high-strength rendering facility wastewaters following an ultrafiltration step. These wastewaters present significant challenges to classical treatment technologies. Constant-pressure, direct-flow membrane filtration experiments were done to screen for flux and effluent water permeate quality of ten commercial NF and RO membranes. All membranes tested were effective in reducing total dissolved salts (TDS) and chemical oxygen demand (COD); however, only two membranes (Koch MPF-34 and Toray 70UB) gave sufficiently stable flux values to warrant longer term cross-flow filtration studies. Cross-flow flux measurements, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and attenuated total reflectance-Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) indicated that both membranes were eventually fouled by organic and inorganic foulants; however, the Toray 70UB RO membrane yielded a capacity of 1600 L/m(2) prior to cleaning. A preliminary economic analysis compared the estimated costs of energy and consumables for a dual-stage UF/RO membrane process and dissolved air floatation (DAF) and found membrane process costs could be less than about 40% of the current DAF process.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2077-0375			WOS:000373724900012		
J	Zhang, Xiao-Hua; Morad, Martin								Calcium signaling in human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes: Evidence from normal subjects and CPVT afflicted patients								CELL CALCIUM				59	2-3	SI		98	107		10.1016/j.ceca.2015.12.002			MAR 2016	2016	Derivation of cardiomyocyte cell lines from human fibroblasts (induced pluripotent stem cells, iPSCs) has made it possible not only to investigate the electrophysiological and Ca2+ signaling properties of these cells, but also to determine the altered electrophysiological and Ca2+-signaling profiles of such cells lines derived from patients expressing mutation-inducing pathologies. This approach has the potential of generating in vitro human models of cardiovascular diseases where cellular pathology can be investigated in detail and possibly specific pharmacotherapy developed. Although this approach has been applied to a number of mutations in channel proteins that cause arrhythmias, there are only few detailed reports addressing Ca2+ signaling pathologies beyond measurements of Ca2+ transients in intact non-voltage clamped cells. Unfortunately, full understanding of Ca2+ signaling pathologies remains elusive, not only because of the plethora of Ca2+ signaling proteins defects that cause arrhythmias and cardiomyopathies, but also because detailed functional properties of Ca2+ signaling proteins are difficult to obtain. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT1) is a malignant inherited arrhythmogenic disorder predominantly caused by mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2). Thus far over 150 mutations in RyR2 have been identified that appear to cause this arrhythmia, a number of which have been expressed and studied in transgenic mice or cell-line models. The development of human iPSC-technology makes it possible to create human heart cell-lines carrying these mutations, making detailed identification of Ca2+ signaling defects and its specific pharmacotherapy possible.In this review we shall first briefly summarize the essential characteristics of the mammalian cardiac Ca2+ signaling, then compare them to Ca2+ signaling phenotypes of human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) and to those of rat neonatal cardiomyocytes, and categorize the possible variance in Ca2+ signaling defects, caused by different CPVT-inducing mutations as expressed in hiPSC-CMs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

O'Bryan, Christopher/0000-0002-6472-6957			Novel habitat use supports population maintenance in a reconfigured landscape								ECOSPHERE				7	3					e01228	10.1002/ecs2.1228			MAR 2016	2016	Given the limited scope of unaltered, protected areas in most regions, understanding the contributions to imperiled species conservation by landscapes in which habitat elements have been reconfigured is critical. Commercial forestry has been a driver of altered structure and composition of forests and of distribution and character of aquatic systems. In eastern North America, extensive historical wetland drainage reconfigured hydrologic environments from low-gradient wet flats and isolated wetlands to connected networks of linear ditches. Landscapes where both uplands and aquatic environments differ from historic conditions may affect most ecological aspects of semi-aquatic species, including reptiles. Our objective was to determine if habitat selection and use decisions by spotted turtles (Clemmys guttata), a rare semi-aquatic species, supported population maintenance in a reconfigured forest landscape in eastern North Carolina, USA. We captured 280 individuals and radiomarked 31 adults to examine habitat selection at multiple spatial scales with paired logistic regression, movements and home ranges with location data and utilization distributions (UDs), survival with a known-fate model, and abundance with N-mixture modeling. Across local and landscape scales, turtles selected features associated with ditches despite abundant, more natural aquatic depressions across the study area. Habitat metrics describing understory closure and substrate characteristics were important at local scales, and closed canopy forest and habitat heterogeneity was positively associated with activity areas at landscape-scale spatial grains. Both movements and home ranges were centered on ditches, and turtles exploited ditches to access mates, nest sites, or uplands for estivation. In this highly reconfigured landscape, this species appeared to have sufficient behavioral plasticity to acquire key resources contributing to high survival and an abundant population. Isolation from road traffic and collection, both which negatively affect turtles elsewhere, was facilitated by limited public access. Our results suggest that conservation and management of rare species should not rely solely on habitat information gained from studies in more pristine areas because such results may not demonstrate the range in variation in behavior that might allow persistence in novel environments, absent key threats.									2	0	0	1	0	2			2150-8925			WOS:000374896800007

A comparative performance analysis of electrically optimized nonlinear energy harvesters								JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MATERIAL SYSTEMS AND STRUCTURES				27	4			537	548		10.1177/1045389X15573344			MAR 2016	2016	Depending on the shape of their potential energy function, nonlinear vibratory energy harvesters (VEHs) can be classified either as mono- or bi-stable. The complex dynamic responses of such harvesters make it difficult to accurately analyze their performance relative to one another. In this paper, we aim to tackle this issue by comparing the performance of these two classes in response to harmonic fixed-frequency excitations under optimal electric loading conditions. To achieve this goal, the mathematical model of a generic nonlinear VEH capable of operating in both of the mono-and bi-stable configurations is considered. Using perturbation methods, analytical expressions for the steady-state output power are obtained. The output power is then optimized with respect to the time constant ratio which represents a direct measure of the electric load. We study the variation of the optimal output power with the excitation frequency in both configurations for different potential shapes and excitation levels. It is shown that, tuning the optimal time constant ratio close to the excitation frequency results in maximum power transduction in both configurations. Results also illustrate that bi-stable VEHs produce higher power levels than mono-stable ones under optimal electric loading conditions regardless of the shape of the potential function.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1045-389X	1530-8138		WOS:000370432200009

High-molecular-weight poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) was used as the polymeric host. SPE characterization was accomplished using modulated differential scanning calorimetry (MDSC), H-1 and F-19 NMR spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Ionic conductivities for SPEs made using the new salts, and also using lithium triflate (LiTf) and lithium bis[(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]imide (LiTFSI) as controls, were measured over a temperature range between 120 degrees C and room temperature for materials with an ethylene oxide to lithium (EO/Li) ratio of 30-1. Conductivities varied depending upon the structure of the alcohol or diol used to make the salt, and were generally higher for alcohols/diols having more perfluorinated methylene groups.

A Flexible, Computationally Efficient Method for Fitting the Proportional Hazards Model to Interval-Censored Data								BIOMETRICS				72	1			222	231		10.1111/biom.12389			MAR 2016	2016	The proportional hazards model (PH) is currently the most popular regression model for analyzing time-to-event data. Despite its popularity, the analysis of interval-censored data under the PH model can be challenging using many available techniques. This article presents a new method for analyzing interval-censored data under the PH model. The proposed approach uses a monotone spline representation to approximate the unknown nondecreasing cumulative baseline hazard function. Formulating the PH model in this fashion results in a finite number of parameters to estimate while maintaining substantial modeling flexibility. A novel expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is developed for finding the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters. The derivation of the EM algorithm relies on a two-stage data augmentation involving latent Poisson random variables. The resulting algorithm is easy to implement, robust to initialization, enjoys quick convergence, and provides closed-form variance estimates. The performance of the proposed regression methodology is evaluated through a simulation study, and is further illustrated using data from a large population-based randomized trial designed and sponsored by the United States National Cancer Institute.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0006-341X	1541-0420		WOS:000373914700023	26393917

Chicken fats were respectively heated at 7 temperatures with an interval increment of 20 degrees C within 60-180 degrees C, while non-heated chicken fat was as a control. Thirteen kinds of fatty acids were identified by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). These fatty acids were divided into 3 categories including 7 saturated fatty acids (SFA), 3 monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), and 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Fifty-two kinds of aroma compounds were detected from lipid-Mallard reaction products (MRPs). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical analysis indicated the significant difference (p < 0.001) in six sensory attributes (fatty, meaty, roasty, off-flavor, fresh and overall odor) of MRPs. Partial least square regression (PLSR) was used to detect positive correlation among fatty acids, volatile compounds and sensory attributes. The result showed that 100 degrees C sample (S-100) was correlated with overall flavor and MUFA.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1344-6606			WOS:000373752800011

Qualitative Comparison of Women's Perspectives on the Functions and Benefits of Group and Individual Prenatal Care								JOURNAL OF MIDWIFERY & WOMENS HEALTH				61	2			224	234		10.1111/jmwh.12379			MAR-APR 2016	2016	IntroductionWomen's definitions and experiences of the functions and benefits of their routine prenatal care are largely absent from research and public discourse on prenatal care outcomes. This qualitative study aimed to develop a framework of women's prenatal care experiences by comparing the experiences of women in individual and group prenatal care.MethodsWe conducted serial qualitative interviews with racially diverse low-income women receiving individual prenatal care (n = 14) or group prenatal care (n = 15) through pregnancy and the early postpartum period. We completed 42 second-trimester, 48 third-trimester, and 44 postpartum interviews. Using grounded theory, the semistructured interviews were coded for themes, and the themes were integrated into an explanatory framework of prenatal care functions and benefits.ResultsIndividual and group participants described similar benefits in 3 prenatal care functions: confirming health, preventing and monitoring medical complications, and building supportive provider relationships. For the fourth function, educating and preparing, group care participants experienced more benefits and different benefits. The benefits for group participants were enhanced by the supportive group environment. Group participants described greater positive influences on stress, confidence, knowledge, motivation, informed decision making, and health care engagement.DiscussionWhereas pregnant women want to maximize their probability of having a healthy newborn, other prenatal care outcomes are also important: reducing pregnancy-related stress; developing confidence and knowledge for improving health; preparing for labor, birth, and newborn care; and having supportive relationships. Group prenatal care may be more effective in attaining these outcomes. Achieving these outcomes is increasingly relevant in health care systems prioritizing woman-centered care and improved birth outcomes. How to achieve them should be part of policy development and research.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1526-9523	1542-2011		WOS:000373808100010	26878599

Engineering Promoter Architecture in Oleaginous Yeast Yarrowia lipolytica								ACS SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY				5	3			213	223		10.1021/acssynbio.5b00100			MAR 2016	2016	Eukaryotic promoters have a complex architecture to control both the strength and timing of gene transcription spanning up to thousands of bases from the initiation site. This complexity makes rational fine-tuning of promoters in fungi difficult to predict; however, this very same complexity enables multiple possible strategies for engineering promoter strength. Here, we studied promoter architecture in the oleaginous yeast, Yarrowia lipolytica. While recent studies have focused on upstream activating sequences, we systematically examined various components common in fungal promoters. Here, we examine several promoter components including upstream activating sequences, proximal promoter sequences, core promoters, and the TATA box in autonomously replicating expression plasmids and integrated into the genome. Our findings show that promoter strength can be fine-tuned through the engineering of the TATA box sequence, core promoter, and upstream activating sequences. Additionally, we identified a previously unreported oleic acid responsive transcription enhancement in the XPR2 upstream activating sequences, which illustrates the complexity of fungal promoters. The promoters engineered here provide new genetic tools for metabolic engineering in Y. lipolytica and provide promoter engineering strategies that may be useful in engineering other non-model fungal systems.									2	0	0	1	0	2			2161-5063			WOS:000372672500004

An Experimental Study of the Collection of Fog Droplets Using a Mesh Fabric: Possible Application to Cooling Towers								JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESOURCES TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME				138	2					024501	10.1115/1.4031969			MAR 2016	2016	An experimental study is presented of the ability of fine meshes to remove fog drops from an air flow. Specifically, the collection efficiency (CE) was measured for fog drops passing through mesh fabrics. Meshes composed of cotton, nylon, and Teflon were investigated, and the effect of the material as well as mesh porosity was determined. Collection efficiencies ranging from 5% to 50% were obtained. The ultimate goal of this work is to employ such meshes in a parachute configuration above power plant cooling towers, so that condensed fog may be collected and returned to the cooling loop. It is shown that the drop diameters and velocities investigated here are similar to those observed above cooling towers.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0195-0738			WOS:000373707300015

Transfer of subcellular organelles through TNTs was observed in vitro and in vivo, but the formation and significance of these structures is not well understood. A polydimethylsiloxane biochip-based coculture model was devised to constrain TNT orientation and explore both TNT-formation and TNT-mediated mitochondrial transfer. Two parallel microfluidic channels connected by an array of smaller microchannels enabled localization of stem cell and cardiomyocyte populations while allowing connections to form between them. Stem cells and cardiomyocytes were deposited in their respective microfluidic channels, and stem cell-cardiomyocyte pairs were formed via the microchannels. Formation of TNTs and transfer of stained mitochondria through TNTs was observed by 24 h real-time video recording. The data show that stem cells are 7.7 times more likely to initiate contact by initial extension of filopodia. By 24 h, 67% of nanotube connections through the microchannels are composed of cardiomyocyte membrane. Filopodial extension and retraction by stemcells draws an extension of TNTs from cardiomyocytes. MitoTracker staining shows that unidirectional transfer of mitochondria between stem cell-cardiomyocyte pairs invariably originates from stem cells. Control experiments with cardiac fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes show little nanotube formation between homotypic or mixed cell pairs and no mitochondrial transfer. These data identify a novel biological process, unidirectional mitochondrial transfer, mediated by heterotypic TNT connections. This suggests that the enhancement of cardiomyocyte function seen after stem-cell injection may be due to a bioenergetic stimulus provided by mitochondrial transfer.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1758-5082	1758-5090		WOS:000373289000016	26844857

Morphological characteristics of stearic acid-grafted starch-compatibilized linear low density polyethylene/thermoplastic starch blown film								EUROPEAN POLYMER JOURNAL				76				266	277		10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2016.02.001			MAR 2016	2016	The objective of the present work is to verify the possibility of using stearic acid-grafted starch (ST-SA) as a novel compatibilizer for a blend system consisting of linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) and thermoplastic starch (TPS). ST-SA was successfully synthesized, as confirmed by FTIR and H-1 NMR techniques. The obtained ST-SA was compounded with LLDPE and TPS in a twin-screw extruder. A weight ratio of LLDPE:TPS was fixed at 60:40, while ST-SA concentrations were varied from 1% to 5%. The blends were further converted into films by blown film extrusion. Incorporation of ST-SA improved the extrusion process ability and melt flowability of the LLDPE/TPS blends. In addition, the blends became compatible and homogeneous when ST-SA was loaded due to the increased interfacial adhesion between LLDPE and TPS phases. The results suggest that ST-SA, particularly at a content of 1%, could serve as an effective compatibilizer for the immiscible LLDPE/TPS blend system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Consequently, it is often assumed that a retailer's organic traffic is driven by the prominence of its position in the list of search results. We propose a novel measure of the prominence of a retailer's name, and show that it is also an important predictor of the organic traffic retailers enjoy from product searches through Google and Bing. We also show that failure to account for the prominence of retailers' names-as well as the endogeneity of retailers' positions in the list of search results-significantly inflates the estimated impact of screen position on organic clicks.

Evidence for maternal control of seed size in maize from phenotypic and transcriptional analysis								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY				67	6			1907	1917		10.1093/jxb/erw006			MAR 2016	2016	Seed size is an important component of grain yield and a key determinant trait for crop domestication. The Krug Yellow Dent long-term selection experiment for large and small seed provides a valuable resource to dissect genetic and phenotypic changes affecting seed size within a common genetic background. In this study, inbred lines derived from Krug Large Seed (KLS) and Krug Small Seed (KSS) populations and reciprocal F-1 crosses were used to investigate developmental and molecular mechanisms governing seed size. Seed morphological characteristics showed striking differences between KLS and KSS inbred lines, and the reciprocal cross experiment revealed a strong maternal influence on both seed weight and seed size. Quantification of endosperm area, starchy endosperm cell size, and kernel dry mass accumulation indicated a positive correlation between seed size, endosperm cell number, and grain filling rate, and patterns of grain filling in reciprocal crosses mirrored that of the maternal parent. Consistent with the maternal contribution to seed weight, transcriptome profiling of reciprocal F-1 hybrids showed substantial similarities to the maternal parent. A set of differentially expressed genes between KLS and KSS inbreds were found, which fell into a broad number of functional categories including DNA methylation, nucleosome assembly, and heat stress response. In addition, gene co-expression network analysis of parental inbreds and reciprocal F-1 hybrids identified co-expression modules enriched in ovule development and DNA methylation, implicating these two processes in seed size determination. These results expand our understanding of seed size regulation and help to uncover the developmental and molecular basis underlying maternal control of seed size in maize.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-0957	1460-2431		WOS:000372981800027	26826570

This paper describes the analysis of data taken during the first 62 months of the mission in the energy range 1-100 GeV from a 15 degrees x 15 degrees region about the direction of the GC. Specialized interstellar emission models (IEMs) are constructed to enable the separation of the.-ray emissions produced by cosmic ray particles interacting with the interstellar gas and radiation fields in the Milky Way into that from the inner similar to 1 kpc surrounding the GC, and that from the rest of the Galaxy. A catalog of point sources for the 15 degrees x 15 degrees region is self-consistently constructed using these IEMs: the First Fermi-LAT Inner Galaxy Point Source Catalog (1FIG). The spatial locations, fluxes, and spectral properties of the 1FIG sources are presented, and compared with gamma-ray point sources over the same region taken from existing catalogs. After subtracting the interstellar emission and point-source contributions a residual is found. If templates that peak toward the GC are used to model the positive residual the agreement with the data improves, but none of the additional templates tried account for all of its spatial structure. The spectrum of the positive residual modeled with these templates has a strong dependence on the choice of IEM.									45	0	0	0	0	45			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000372303400044		
J	Wang, Min; Sun, Xiaoqian; Park, Chanseok								Bayesian analysis of Birnbaum-Saunders distribution via the generalized ratio-of-uniforms method								COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS				31	1			207	225		10.1007/s00180-015-0629-z			MAR 2016	2016	This paper deals with the Bayesian inference for the parameters of the Birnbaum-Saunders distribution. We adopt the inverse-gamma priors for the shape and scale parameters because the continuous conjugate joint prior distribution does not exist and the reference prior (or independent Jeffreys' prior) results in an improper posterior distribution. We propose an efficient sampling algorithm via the generalized ratio-of-uniforms method to compute the Bayesian estimates and the credible intervals. One appealing advantage of the proposed procedure over other sampling techniques is that it efficiently generates independent samples from the required posterior distribution. Simulation studies are conducted to investigate the behavior of the proposed method, and two real-data applications are analyzed for illustrative purposes.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0943-4062	1613-9658		WOS:000372430200009

For some languages, it is not uncommon for international students from Asia to constitute more than 50% of current enrollments in a language class. This new reality poses a number of questions, including how to meet students' diverse needs and goals for language study and how to mobilize increasing student diversity to enhance the development of global competence among all students, regardless of country of origin. Using semi-structured exploratory interviews conducted with domestic and international students of Japanese as a foreign language at an American university, this study investigated the challenges and opportunities presented in the globalized language classroom.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0015-718X	1944-9720		WOS:000372505800011

The collaborative inquiry exposed the disciplinary knowledge gap of the literacy coach (a former language arts teacher) and the science teacher's limited knowledge of literacy instruction. These shared disciplinary knowledge gaps necessitated the co-construction of collaborative practices to ameliorate the tension and improve disciplinary literacy instruction. Through a recognition of individual knowledge and the use of responsive disciplinary teaching, the participants created collaborative symbiosis. To improve disciplinary literacy teaching, schools should recognize teacher disciplinary knowledge and expand participation in discipline-specific collaborative inquiry.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1081-3004	1936-2706		WOS:000372285200008

Ballistic Impact Behavior of Nacre-Like Laminated Composites Consisting of B4C Tablets and Polyurea Matrix								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				25	3			977	994		10.1007/s11665-016-1926-6			MAR 2016	2016	A nacre-like composite armor consisting of B4C tablets and polyurea matrix is modeled, and its ballistic impact behavior and penetration resistance (under a normal and a 15A degrees-oblique impact by a solid right circular cylindrical projectile) were analyzed using a series of transient, nonlinear dynamic, finite-element analyses. Nacre is a biological material constituting the innermost layer of the shells of gastropods and bivalves. It consists of polygonal tablets of aragonite, tessellated to form individual layers and having the adjacent layers as well as the tablets within a layer bonded by a biopolymer. Due to its highly complex hierarchical microstructure, nacre possesses an outstanding combination of mechanical properties, the properties which are far superior to the ones that are predicted using the homogenization techniques such as the rule of mixtures. The results of the transient nonlinear dynamic analysis pertaining to the ballistic impact response and the penetration resistance of the modeled nacre-like armor are compared with their counterparts for the B4C single-block armor having an identical areal density. Furthermore, the effect of various nacre microstructural features (e.g., surface profiling, micron-scale asperities, mineral bridges between the overlapping tablets lying in adjacent layers) on the ballistic penetration resistance of the nacre-like composite armor is investigated in order to identify an optimal nacre-like composite-armor architecture having the largest penetration resistance. The results obtained clearly show that a nacre-like armor possesses a superior penetration resistance relative to its monolithic counterpart, and that the nacre microstructural features considered play a critical role in the armor penetration resistance.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1059-9495	1544-1024		WOS:000372309100029		
J	Grujicic, M.; Snipes, J. S.; Ramaswami, S.								Multi-Length Scale Analysis of the Effect of Fused-Silica Pre-shocking on its Tendency for Devitrification								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				25	3			995	1009		10.1007/s11665-016-1940-8			MAR 2016	2016	Recent studies have suggested that impact-induced devitrification of fused silica, or more specifically formation of high-density stishovite, can significantly improve ballistic-penetration resistance of fused silica, the material which is used in transparent armor. The studies have also shown that in order for stishovite to form during a ballistic impact event, very high projectile kinetic energy normalized by the projectile/fused-silica target-plate contact area must accompany such an event. Otherwise fused-silica devitrification, if taking place, does not substantially improve the material ballistic-penetration resistance. In the present work, all-atom molecular-level computations are carried out in order to establish if pre-shocking of fused-silica target-plates (to form stishovite) and subsequent unloading (to revert stishovite to the material amorphous structure) can increase fused silica's propensity for stishovite formation during a ballistic impact. Towards that end, molecular-level computational procedures are developed to simulate both the pre-shocking treatment of the fused-silica target-plate and its subsequent impact by a solid right-circular cylindrical projectile. The results obtained clearly revealed that when strong-enough shockwaves are used in the fused-silica target-plate pre-shocking procedure, the propensity of fused silica for stishovite formation during the subsequent ballistic impact is increased, as is the associated ballistic-penetration resistance. To rationalize these findings, a detailed post-processing microstructural analysis of the pre-shocked material is employed. The results obtained suggest that fused silica pre-shocked with shockwaves of sufficient strength retain some memory/embryos of stishovite, and these embryos facilitate stishovite formation during the subsequent ballistic impact.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1059-9495	1544-1024		WOS:000372309100030

Effect of Macropore Anisotropy on the Mechanical Response of Hierarchically Porous Ceramics								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CERAMIC SOCIETY				99	3			979	987		10.1111/jace.14004			MAR 2016	2016	Porous ceramics are commonly used in electrochemical, catalytic, biological, and filtration processes, but in many cases, improvements to their designed performance come at the expense of their mechanical properties. By controlling the pore morphology and orientation, it is possible to mitigate some mechanical losses while maintaining adequately porous microstructures. Hierarchically, porous ceramics with similar porosities but differing macropore arrangements were synthesized using both freeze casting and slip casting, and then tested in compression to study the effects of macropore morphology and orientation on mechanical behavior. The mechanical properties of the anisotropic structures were a strong function of the orientation of the macropores relative to the applied stress. The properties of the isotropic hierarchical porous structures were in between the two orthotropic directions of the anisotropic porous ceramics. For the freeze-cast samples, the compressive strength was a function of the macropore size. The experimental results are rationalized using detailed microstructural analysis.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000372189300036

The sensor is fabricated using a femto-second (fs) laser. The fs-laser-based fabrication makes the sensor thermally stable to sustain operating temperatures as high as 800 degrees C. The sensor has low sensitivity toward the temperature as compared to its response toward the applied strain. The performance of the EFPI sensor is tested in an embedded application. The host material is carbon fiber/bismaleimide (BMI) composite laminate that offer thermally stable characteristics at high ambient temperatures. The sensor exhibits highly linear response toward the temperature and strain. Analytical work done with embedded optical-fiber sensors using the out-of-autoclave BMI laminate was limited until now. The work presented in this paper offers an insight into the strain and temperature interactions of the embedded sensors with the BMI composites.

The collection of cells is accomplished by using enzymatic digestion witch suffer from the need to remove the enzymes after digestion. In addition, enzymatic methods are not applicable for all cells, cell aggregates, cell sheets or 3D structures. The objective of this study was to investigate the release of cultured cells from silicon based Photovoltaic (PV) surfaces using a light source as external stimulation. C2C12 myoblasts were cultured on the negative surface of a PV device and upon confluence they were exposed to light. The amount of released cells was quantified as a function light exposure. It was found that light exposure at 25?000 lux for one hour caused equivalent cell release from the PV surface than trypsination. The released cells are viable and can be re-cultured if needed. This mechanism may offer an alternative method to release excitable cells without using an enzymatic agent. This may be important for cell therapy if larger cell structures such as sheets need to be collected.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1860-6768	1860-7314		WOS:000372141400012	26710125

In particular, batteries with composite electrodes have become popular for automotive applications due to their ability to balance energy density, power density, and cost by adjusting the amount of each material within the electrode. SOH algorithms that do not use electrochemical-based models may have more difficulty maintaining an accurate battery model as the cell ages under varying degradation modes, such as lithium consumption at the solid-electrolyte interface or active material dissolution. Furthermore, efforts to validate electrochemical model-based state estimation algorithms with experimental aging data are limited, particularly for composite electrode cells. In this paper, we first present a reduced-order electrochemical model for a composite LiMn2O4-LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 electrode battery that predicts the surface and bulk lithium concentration of each material in the composite electrode, as well as the current split between each material. The model is then used in dual-nonlinear observers to estimate the cell SOC and loss of cyclable lithium over time. Three different observer types are compared: 1) the extended Kalman filter; 2) fixed interval Kalman smoother; and 3) particle filter. Finally, an experimental aging campaign is used to compare the estimated capacities for five different cells with the measured capacities over time.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1063-6536	1558-0865		WOS:000372002500002

The input crowd is a real-time feed of sparse and low-frequency probe vehicle data, and the output is an estimated collection of Signal Phase and Timing (SPaT) information. The estimations could be ultimately fed into a connected vehicle's driver assistant application. Different from the authors' previous work, the approach described in this paper ensures the accuracy of the SPaT estimations even in the presence of queues. This was achieved by investigating the probe data influenced by the heavy traffic and the delay in queues. This paper is also a sequel to the authors' previous work as it provides an in-depth overview of the crowdsourcing algorithms and their back-end implementation. The accuracy of the crowdsourcing algorithm is also experimentally evaluated for a selection of pre-timed traffic lights in San Francisco, CA, USA, by utilizing a real-time data feed of San Francisco's public buses as an example data source.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1524-9050	1558-0016		WOS:000371982600023		
J	Dragic, Peter D.; Martin, Steve W.; Ballato, Arthur; Ballato, John								On the Anomalously Strong Dependence of the Acoustic Velocity of Alumina on Temperature in Aluminosilicate Glass Optical FibersPart I: Material Modeling and Experimental Validation								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED GLASS SCIENCE				7	1	SI		3	10		10.1111/ijag.12137			MAR 2016	2016	The thermo-acoustic coefficient (TAC, or the change of acoustic velocity with a change in temperature) of the alumina (Al2O3) component in aluminosilicate core silica clad glass optical fibers is anomalously large. It has been speculated previously that this anomaly is not due to a large alumina TAC, but instead due to the thermal expansion mismatch between the aluminosilicate core glass and the pure silica cladding glass. In this new work, it is shown that the acoustic velocity of the aluminosilicate core glass changes much differently than that for a bulk aluminosilicate glass. In the high alumina content compositional range, it is found that the larger core-region thermal expansion results in a net positive pressure imparted on the silica component in the core. As the acoustic velocity of silica has a strong negative dependence on any applied pressure, this offsets the bulk positive-valued thermal response of silica. Utilizing a modified form of the Winkelmann-Schott additivity model, the effect of the thermal expansion mismatch between the core and clad glasses is incorporated, and the resultant TAC determined for alumina is fully consistent with data found in the literature for bulk alumina. The consideration and incorporation of the thermal expansion of the core and clad glasses adds another degree of freedom to the design of specialty optical fibers for distributed sensor applications. Complementary to this article, Part II describes an efficient computational route for determining selected physical properties of an amorphous analog to a given crystalline form whose physical properties are known.									4	0	0	0	0	4			2041-1286	2041-1294		WOS:000372012700001

Batch uptake studies were performed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, liquid scintillation counting, and alpha spectroscopy. The thin film yielded rapid Pu uptake kinetics and an equilibrium constant (K (d)) of approximately 9060 L kg(-1). The anion-exchange capacity of the films was determined to be 1.3 x 10(-4) +/- A 1.1 x 10(-5) eq g(-1) using Cl-36 uptake studies.

The test results showed that, compared with the use of pure cement, the binary use of silica fume and cement or the binary use of fly ash and cement resulted in an increase in the drying shrinkage of paste, and the binary use of meta-kaolin and cement resulted in a decrease in the drying shrinkage of paste. The ternary use of meta-kaolin, fly ash and cement could produce paste with lower drying shrinkage than the binary use of silica fume and cement at the same supplementary cementitious materials content. Modified Gardner model and modified Bazant-Baweja B3 model were developed to predict the drying shrinkage development of the paste fraction of ultra-high performance concrete. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

A Contemporary Analysis of Accounting Professionals' Work-Life Balance								ACCOUNTING HORIZONS				30	1			41	62		10.2308/acch-51262			MAR 2016	2016	In recent years, work-life balance surpassed compensation as the most important job satisfaction factor among AICPA members (American Institute of Certified Public Accountants [AICPA] 2004). Despite the continued importance of this issue in the accounting profession (AICPA 2011), prior research has not examined work-life balance perceptions across different segments of the profession. We survey 1,063 practicing CPAs in order to assess the comparative work-life balance perceptions across (1) Big 4 versus smaller public accounting firms, (2) audit versus tax functions, and (3) public accounting versus industry work contexts. Consistent with predictions based on institutional logics theory, we find that work-family conflict and job burnout perceptions (our proxies for work-life balance) are highest in the Big 4. We are the first study to measure both support-for and viability-of traditional alternative work arrangements (AWAs), and we report an important distinction between these two constructs. Specifically, while CPAs across all public accounting firms (i.e., Big 4, national, regional, and local firms) report similar levels of organizational support-for AWAs, Big 4 professionals report significantly lower perceived viability-of AWAs (i.e., the ability to use AWAs and remain effective at one's job) compared to accounting professionals at smaller public accounting firms. Further, we find no differences between audit and tax professionals' perceptions across any of our work-life balance measures. We also document nuanced differences regarding work life balance perceptions in public accounting versus industry. For example, contrary to conventional wisdom, work life balance is not uniformly "better" in industry (e.g., burnout is actually lower in smaller public accounting firms compared to industry). Finally, we use open-ended responses from a follow-up survey to provide several recommendations for firms to improve their work-life balance efforts.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0888-7993	1558-7975		WOS:000371752100003		
J	Huang, Yu Chih; Backman, Kenneth Frank; Backman, Sheila J.; Chang, Lan Lan								Exploring the Implications of Virtual Reality Technology in Tourism Marketing: An Integrated Research Framework								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TOURISM RESEARCH				18	2			116	128		10.1002/jtr.2038			MAR-APR 2016	2016	The proliferation of the Internet and other technological innovations has transformed the structure of the tourism industry as well as affected how tourism destinations are perceived and consumed. The 3D virtual world provides opportunities for destination marketing organizations to communicate with targeted markets by offering a rich environment for potential visitors to explore tourism destinations. However, as of yet, there is little understanding about how to effectively market tourism destinations to virtual world participants who are technology users as well as potential consumers. The purpose of the present study is to develop a research framework that integrates the technology acceptance model (TAM) and self-determination theory to understand how tourists use a 3D virtual world. Primary data were obtained for this study through self-administered Web questionnaires. The data were conducted in a laboratory setting with 186 participants. This study contributes to the empirical TAM literature by applying the model to a 3D virtual tourism site. Additionally, this study provides a research framework to capture the entertainment nature of a 3D virtual world by extending the TAM to incorporate psychological elements of self-determination theory to understand consumer experience. From the perspective of tourism professionals, this study contributes to an understanding of how best to construct informative and interactive tourist destinations in 3D virtual worlds to attract potential online and real-world tourists.

J	Wang, Hongye; Chen, Zhao; Jiang, Xiuping								Improving the Enrichment and Plating Methods for Rapid Detection of Non-O157 Shiga Toxin-Producing Escherichia coli in Dairy Compost								JOURNAL OF FOOD PROTECTION				79	3			413	420		10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-15-249			MAR 2016	2016	A culture method to detect non-O157 Shiga toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC) was optimized in this study. The finished dairy compost with 30% moisture content was inoculated with a cocktail of six non-O157 STEC serovars at initial concentrations of 1 to 100 CFU/g. Afterward, non-O157 STEC cells in the inoculated dairy compost were enriched by four methods, followed by plating onto cefixime-tellurite sorbitol MacConkey agar supplemented with 5 mg/liter novobiocin (CTN-SMAC) and modified Rainbow agar containing 5 mg/liter novobiocin, 0.05 mg/liter cefixime trihydrate, and 0.15 mg/liter potassium tellurite (mRBA). Immunomagnetic bead separation (IMS) was used to compare the cell concentration of individual non-O157 STEC serotypes after enrichment. There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) between CTN-SMAC and mRBA for non-O157 STEC enumeration. The single-step selective enrichment recovered ca.0.54 log CFU/g more cells (ca. 0.41 log CFU/g for compost-adapted cells) (P < 0.05) compared with the two-step enrichment. Furthermore, the duration of the process to detect non-O157 STEC from dairy compost by selective enrichment, followed by IMS, was optimized. Among six non-O157 STEC serotypes, serotypes 0111, 045, and 0145 reached the highest cell density after enrichment in dairy compost, and the cell populations reached 7.3, 7.4, and 7.8 log CFU/g within 16 h of incubation, respectively. In contrast, without an enrichment step, the IMS detection limit of individual non-O157 STEC serovars ranged from 3.15 to 4.15 log CFU/g in dairy compost. These results demonstrate that low levels of non-O157 STEC can be detected within 2 days from dairy compost by using a culture method with an optimized enrichment procedure followed by IMS.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0362-028X	1944-9097		WOS:000371557200008	26939651

A screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) was modified with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and then functionalized with recombinant shed acute phase antigen (SAPA). The AuNPs/SPCE was characterized by scanning electron microscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and X-ray diffraction. The AuNPs provide an increased active surface area, high conductivity, and improved electrocatalytic characteristics, this resulting in a significant improvement of the detection limit. Following interaction between immobilized SAPA and the target antibodies in the serum sample, secondary antibody (an anti-human IgM-HRP conjugate) and solutions of H2O2 and 4-tert-butylcatechol were added and the enzymatic product was detected at -100 mV (vs. Ag/SPCE). The resulting current was proportional to the anti-T. cruzi IgM antibodies present in the sample and showed a linear trend from 10 to 200 ng mL(-1) (R = 0.998). The detection limit was 3.03 ng mL(-1). These values demonstrate that this electrochemical immunosensor can be used as an alternative serological method for diagnosis of congenital Chagas disease.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0026-3672	1436-5073		WOS:000371645200032

Using consensual qualitative research (Hill et al., 1997, 2005), we interviewed eight Division I female student-athletes who participated in an empowerment program about their experiences. Five domains were revealed: (a) perception of psychological empowerment, (b) perception of social empowerment, (c) perception of physical empowerment, (d) perception of biggest "takeaways," and (e) experience of program. Findings illustrated the importance of empowering female student-athletes to believe in themselves, to act upon those beliefs, and to build community around those beliefs.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0888-4781	1543-2793		WOS:000371848600005		
J	Terry, William C.								Solving seasonality in tourism? Labour shortages and guest worker programmes in the USA								AREA				48	1			111	118		10.1111/area.12242			MAR 2016	2016	The purpose of this paper is to examine the use of guest workers in tourism and hospitality in the USA. Despite the fact that many jobs in tourism require few hard skills and should therefore be open to a wide labour market, human resource managers report a dearth of qualified applicants. In order to meet seasonal shortfalls of workers, many have turned to the H-2B and J-1 programmes as a means of accessing foreign guest workers. Each comes with a particular set of rules and regulations that produce a different sort of worker, the H-2B workers with more experience but higher costs, and the J-1 workers with less experience, but more flexibility and lower costs. The study is based on qualitative interviews and analysis of hiring managers and recruiters in the Carolinas in the USA. Results provide a voice for operators to express the challenges they face in recruiting in a seasonal industry, and suggest that neither programme is adequate to fully meet the hiring needs of the industry.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0004-0894	1475-4762		WOS:000371255300015

The study aim was to examine if use of AHS is influenced by visitor characteristics and the location of AHS within the lobby of a large hospital.Methods: An observational study was conducted with AHS placed in 3 different locations. The data included visitor characteristics and if AHS were used.Results: The results suggest that visitors are 5.28 times (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.68-7.82) more likely to use AHS when dispensers are located in the middle of the lobby with limited landmarks or barriers, 1.35 times more likely to use the AHS in the afternoon compared with the morning, or when they are younger visitors (adjusted odds ratio, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.09-1.97). Individuals in a group are more likely (adjusted odds ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.06-1.84) to use AHS.Discussion: In addition to location, time of day, and age, there is a group effect that results in visitors being more likely to use AHS when in a group. The increased use related to groups may serve as a mechanism to encourage visitor HH.Conclusions: The results suggest future research opportunities to investigate the effect of group dynamics and social pressure on visitor AHS use and to identify strategies for improving visitor HH.

Novel binary deep eutectic electrolytes for rechargeable Li-ion batteries based on mixtures of alkyl sulfonamides and lithium perfluoroalkylsulfonimide salts								JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES				307				519	525		10.1016/j.jpowsour.2015.11.072			MAR 1 2016	2016	Ionic liquids (IL's) were proposed for use in Li-ion batteries (LIBs), in order to mitigate some of the well-known drawbacks of LiPF6/mixed organic carbonates solutions. However, their large cations seriously decrease lithium transference numbers and block lithium insertion sites at electrode-electrolyte interfaces, leading to poor LIB rate performance. Deep eutectic electrolytes (DEEs) (which share some of the advantages of ILs but possess only one cation, Li+), were then proposed, in order to overcome the difficulties associated with ILs. We report herein on the preparation, thermal properties (melting, crystallization, and glass transition temperatures), transport properties (specific conductivity and viscosity) and thermal stability of binary DEEs based on mixtures of lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide or lithium bis(fluoro)sulfonimide salts with an alkyl sulfonamide solvent. Promise for LIB applications is demonstrated by chronoamperometry on Al current collectors, and cycling behavior of negative and positive electrodes. Residual current densities of 12 and 45 nA cm(-2) were observed at 5 V vs. Li/Li+ on aluminum, 1.5 and 16 nA cm(-2) at 4.5 V vs. Li/Li+, respectively for LiFSI and LiTFSI based DEEs. Capacities of 220, 130, and 175 mAh. g(-1) were observed at low (C/13 or C/10) rates, respectively for petroleum coke, LiMn1/3Ni1/3Co1/3O2 (a.k.a. NMC 111) and LiAl0.05Co0.15Ni0.8O2 (a.k.a. NCA).

Structure of Rigid Polymers Confined to Nanoparticles: Molecular Dynamics Simulations Insight								LANGMUIR				32	8			2102	2109		10.1021/acs.langmuir.5b04568			MAR 1 2016	2016	Nanoparticles (NPs) grafted with organic layers form hybrids able to retain their unique properties through integration into the mesoscopic scale. The organic layer structure and response often determine the functionality of the hybrids on the mesoscopic length scale. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we probe the conformation of luminescent rigid polymers, dialkyl poly(p-phenylene ethynylene)s (PPE), end grafted onto a silica nanoparticle in different solvents as the molecular weights and polymer coverages are varied. We find that, in contrast to NP-grafted flexible polymers, the chains are fully extended independent of the solvent. In toluene and decane, which are good solvents, the grafted PPEs chains assume a similar conformation to that observed in dilute solutions. In water, which is a poor solvent for the PPEs, the polymer chains form one large duster but remain extended. The radial distribution of the chains around the core of the nanoparticle is homogeneous in good solvents, whereas in poor solvents clusters are formed independent of molecular weights and coverages. The clustering is distinctively different from the response of grafted flexible and semiflexible polymers.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0743-7463			WOS:000371371600021	26844821

Identifying Deformation and Strain Hardening Behaviors of Nanoscale Metallic Multilayers Through Nano-wear Testing								METALLURGICAL AND MATERIALS TRANSACTIONS A-PHYSICAL METALLURGY AND MATERIALS SCIENCE				47A	3			1083	1095		10.1007/s11661-015-3284-7			MAR 2016	2016	In complex loading conditions (e.g., sliding contact), mechanical properties, such as strain hardening and initial hardness, will dictate the long-term performance of materials systems. With this in mind, the strain hardening behaviors of Cu/Nb nanoscale metallic multilayer systems were examined by performing nanoindentation tests within nanoscratch wear boxes and undeformed regions (as-deposited). Both the architecture and substrate influence were examined by utilizing three different individual layer thicknesses (2, 20, and 100 nm) and two total film thicknesses (1 and 10 mu m). After nano-wear deformation, multilayer systems with thinner layers showed less volume loss as measured by laser scanning microscopy. Additionally, the hardness of the deformed regions significantly rose with respect to the as-deposited measurements, which further increased with greater wear loads. Strain hardening exponents for multilayers with thinner layers (2 and 20 nm, n approximate to 0.018 and n approximate to 0.022, respectively) were less than that determined for 100 nm systems (n approximate to 0.041). These results suggest that single-dislocation-based deformation mechanisms observed for the thinner systems limit the extent of achievable strain hardening. This conclusion indicates that impacts of both architecture strengthening and strain hardening must be considered to accurately predict multilayer performance during sliding contact across varying length scales.

A thematic analysis of 1214 tweets revealed that the hashtag was hijacked through audience members mocking and criticizing both FSU and Jameis Winston. The results suggest that PR professionals must account for the anticipated "pulse" of the audience before launching campaigns on social media. Underestimating the capabilities of the active social media audience can further exacerbate crisis situations, suggesting that at times, not using social media is a more effective public relations practice.

However, there are concerns regarding potential adverse effects to benthic macroinvertebrates following longterm, repeated applications. Multiple lines-of-evidence are useful for evaluating potential ecological risks. These lines-of-evidence are encompassed in the sediment quality triad (SQT) and include sediment copper concentrations, in situ benthic invertebrate abundance, and sediment toxicity testing. The objective of this study was to measure potential ecological risks associated with long-term applications of copper algaecides in coves in Lay Lake, Alabama. Sediments from three coves treated for 7, 10, and 20 years were compared to sediments from three untreated coves in terms of copper concentrations, in situ benthic macroinvertebrate total abundance, and survival of Hyalella azteca and Chironomus dilutus in laboratory sediment toxicity tests. Sediment copper concentrations were not different between treated and untreated coves, with the exception of one treated cove (PC-1S) that contained elevated sediment copper concentrations compared to all other coves. However, the copper was not bioavailable to organisms based on in situ macroinvertebrate abundance and laboratory toxicity tests. In situ benthic invertebrate abundance was not different between treated and untreated coves. In all sediments tested, there were no measurable adverse effects to H. azteca and there were no significant differences in survival of C. dilutus between treated and untreated coves. Based on the weight-of-evidence approach utilized in this study, long-term copper use in three Lay Lake coves has not resulted in adverse effects to benthic invertebrates compared to untreated coves.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0049-6979	1573-2932		WOS:000371427300019		
J	Thomas, Lindsay								Forms of Duration: Preparedness, the Mars Trilogy, and the Management of Climate Change								AMERICAN LITERATURE				88	1			159	184		10.1215/00029831-3453696			MAR 2016	2016	This essay examines two kinds of speculative fiction focused on the management of climate change: preparedness documents on climate change as a threat to national security, and Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy (1993-96), a science fiction trilogy about the terraformation and colonization of Mars. Focusing on narrative scenarios and exercises that train officials to respond to natural disasters, this essay positions these preparedness documents as part of a system of affective management. They teach participants to cultivate a feeling of neutral detachment to stay calm and cool so that they can react automatically and repeatedly when disaster strikes. This emphasis on detachment and repetition reveals the political stakes of preparedness as a national security paradigm: to maintain the status quo by extending the always catastrophic present into the future. The essay's second half turns to the Mars trilogy to argue that by emphasizing duration, or the heterogeneous lasting of time, the trilogy invites its readers to experience climate change as the intersection of various scales and compositions of time, both human and nonhuman. Demonstrating that the management of climate change is inseparable from an experience of it, the Mars books challenge preparedness by emphasizing ongoing change rather than the containment of a never-ending series of disasters.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0002-9831	1527-2117		WOS:000370908100006

Accurate data regarding relationships between copper-algaecide exposures and responses of microcystin-producing algae are needed to make informed management decisions. Responses of Microcystis aeruginosa were measured in terms of cellular microcystin-LR (MC-LR), aqueous MC-LR, and chlorophyll-a following exposure to CuSO4 and copper-ethanolamine. Comparisons were made between treated and untreated samples, and copper formulations. EC(50)s and slopes for M. aeruginosa responses to copper exposures were calculated. Algal responses followed a sigmoidal exposure-response relationship, and cellular MC-LR and chlorophyll-a were negatively related to copper concentrations. Aqueous MC-LR increased with copper concentrations, although the increase in aqueous MC-LR was not proportional to decreases in cellular MC-LR and chlorophyll-a. Cellular MC-LR and chlorophyll a declined at a greater rate than aqueous MC-LR increased. Total MC-LR was less than untreated controls following copper exposure. Differences were measured between copper formulations in terms of aqueous and total MC-LR concentrations at concentrations of 0.5 and 1.0 mg Cu L-1. Aqueous and total MC-LR were greater (10-20%) following exposure to CuSO4 compared to copper-ethanolamine one day following exposure. The positive relationship between copper concentration and aqueous MC-LR at 0.07-1.0 mg Cu L-1 demonstrates that lower copper concentrations were as effective as higher concentrations in controlling M. aeruginosa while decreasing the total amount of MC-LR, and minimizing the proportion of MC-LR released to the aqueous-phase. Results serve to support more accurate risk evaluations of MC-LR concentrations when M. aeruginosa is exposed to copper-algaecides and when it is untreated.

Analysis of the mediating effect indicated that 42.1% (P = 0.0007) of the association was mediated through prepregnancy BMI.CONCLUSIONSThese findings suggested that earlier menarche was significantly associated with an increased risk of GDM. This association was largely mediated through prepregnancy excessive body adiposity.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0149-5992	1935-5548		WOS:000371091500033	26813668

This paper presents a validated lumped and computationally efficient electrical and thermal model for a cylindrical supercapacitor cell. The electrical model is a two-state equivalent electric circuit model with three parameters that are identified using temporal experiments. The dependence of the parameters on the state of charge, current direction and magnitude (20-200 A), and temperatures ranging from -40 degrees C to 60 degrees C is incorporated in the model. The thermal model is a linear 1-D model with two states. The reversible heat generation which is significant in double-layer capacitors is included in the thermal model. The coupling of the two models enables tuning of the temperature-dependent parameters of the electrical model in real time. The coupled electrothermal model is validated using real-world duty cycles at subzero and room temperatures with root-mean-square errors of (82 mV-87 mV) and (0.17 degrees C-0.21 degrees C) for terminal voltage and temperature, respectively. This accurate model is implementable in real-time power applications and also thermal management studies of supercapacitor packs.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0278-0046	1557-9948		WOS:000370875300024

Herein, the feeder's failure rate is modeled respective to active component of the current flowing through the feeder applying several mathematical functions. In addition, the customers' load type is modeled and load-model-based power flow is applied instead of conventional power flow. Moreover, in order to achieve realistic results, economic factors such as inflation and interest rates and technical factors including yearly load growth and hourly and daily variations of the load are considered in the planning problem. Furthermore, several analyses are done to calculate amounts of the detriment and error due to unreal modeling of the customers' load type and the feeder's failure rate in the DG placement planning problem. It is proved that the unreal modelings can markedly affect the results of the problem and even the optimal locations of the DGs.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0278-0046	1557-9948		WOS:000370875300026

While supply chain performance can have a dramatic impact on the automotive industry, there are multiple, often conflicting objectives that typically are used to optimize performance. We model the trade-off between cost and service level, and present a bi-criteria heuristic optimization methodology for a two-stage, integrated automotive supply chain. Our problem contains sequence-dependent setups on parallel machines and auxiliary resource assignments. We minimize the total cost of setups, inventory holding, and transportation costs, and the maximum percentage of outsourced parts per customer, simultaneously.

However, there is still a need for passive optical switches and limiters with a low limiting threshold (<0.5 J/cm(2)) and higher damage limits. The electronic structure of fullerenes can be modified either through doping or by the encapsulation of endohedral clusters to achieve exotic quantum states of matter such as superconductivity. Building on this ability, we show that the encapsulation of Sc3N, Lu3N or Y3N in Cgo alters the HOMO-LUMO gap and leads to passive optical switches with a significantly low limiting threshold (0.3 J/cm(2)) and a wider operation window (average pulse energy >0.3 mJ in the ns regime).

In this work, we present a novel and highly efficient approach to enhance enzymatic disruption of Chlorella protothecoides cell walls to recover the lipid contents and cell wall compositional sugars. When thermoresponsive polymers, such as poly-(N-isopropylacrylimide-co-allylamine), were mixed with microalgal cell suspensions, cell disruption was increased from 22 to 68%, with equivalent increases in lipid recovery. The use of thermoresponsive polymers allows for simple and efficient separation of polymers after product recovery for reuse in subsequent batches. The highest cell disruption and associated lipid yield reached about 68% and 59%, respectively, which was achieved using 10 mol-% amine copolymers with a loading of 0.05 g/g algal biomass dry weight (BDW). During this process, about 50% of dry algal cell wall was converted to reducing sugars. Furthermore, we found that copolymers were able to disrupt algal cells in the absence of enzyme. Polymer loadings of 0.1 g/g BDW led to the highest cell disruption and lipid recovery for 6 h contact time reaching 32% and 30%, respectively. A quantitative andmorphological analysis on polymer-enhanced microalgal cell disruption is presented, indicating that the polymer may function by stressing and breaking the cell wall and/or protecting enzyme from denaturation.

This study aims to assess tourism-related community quality of life (TCQOL). The study applied Sirgy and Cornell's community QOL model (2001) and modified the measuring approach incorporating resident perceptions of satisfaction, importance, and tourism effects (Andereck and Nyaupane 2010) to evaluate resident perceptions of community quality of life in the context of tourism development. The assessment incorporating the community quality of life model and the modified measuring approach that could be a useful tool for tourism practitioners and scholars to understand resident perceptions of community QOL, assess changes of resident perceived community QOL in a host community, and compare the community QOL experiences to other areas.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1871-2584	1871-2576		WOS:000370462000009

Lipids experiencing coordinated metabolism are detected by analysis of lipid co-occurrence								PLANT CELL AND ENVIRONMENT				39	3			608	617		10.1111/pce.12648			MAR 2016	2016	Identifying lipids that experience coordinated metabolism during heat stress would provide information regarding lipid dynamics under stress conditions and assist in developing heat-tolerant wheat varieties. We hypothesized that co-occurring lipids, which are up-regulated or down-regulated together through time during heat stress, represent groups that can be explained by coordinated metabolism. Wheat plants (Triticum aestivum L.) were subjected to 12days of high day and/or night temperature stress, followed by a 4-day recovery period. Leaves were sampled at four time points, and 165 lipids were measured by electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Correlation analysis of lipid levels in 160 leaf samples from each of two wheat genotypes revealed 13 groups of lipids. Lipids within each group co-occurred through the high day and night temperature stress treatments. The lipid groups can be broadly classified as groups containing extraplastidic phospholipids, plastidic glycerolipids, oxidized glycerolipids, triacylglycerols, acylated sterol glycosides and sterol glycosides. Current knowledge of lipid metabolism suggests that the lipids in each group co-occur because they are regulated by the same enzyme(s). The results suggest that increases in activities of desaturating, oxidizing, glycosylating and acylating enzymes lead to simultaneous changes in levels of multiple lipid species during high day and night temperature stress in wheat.Identifying lipids that experience coordinated metabolism during heat stress would provide information regarding lipid dynamics under stress conditions and assist in developing heat-tolerant wheat varieties.

The main challenges are to obtain well-dispersed CNFs in the polymer matrix and to establish compatible linkages between the CNFs and PP. Manufacturing of CNF reinforced PP nanocomposites was conducted using a twin-screw co-rotating extruder with the masterbatch concept. Modifications of CNFs using maleic anhydride polypropylene were performed. The best mechanical properties of the nanocomposites are 1.94 GPa (tensile modulus), 32.8 MPa (tensile strength), 1.63 GPa (flexural modulus), 50.1 MPa (flexural strength), and 3.8 kJ m(-2) (impact strength), which represents about 36, 11, 21, 7, and 23% improvement, respectively, compared to those of pure PP (1.43 GPa, 29.5 MPa, 1.35 GPa, 46.9 MPa, and 3.1 kJ m(-2)). Fracture morphology examination indicated good dispersion of CNFs in the PP matrix was achieved through this specific manufacturing process. MAPP treatments enhanced the interfacial adhesion between the CNFs and PP. POLYM. COMPOS., 37:782-793, 2016.

To determine stress-strain diagrams and evolution of martensitic microstructure during external loading, a micromechanics based thermo-mechanical material model is used. The results reveal the significant difference between the local and global material behavior when defects are present. It is shown that defects act as nucleation sites and result in transformation localization, which in turn causes a sudden drop in the stress-strain diagram followed by a stress plateau. Moreover, it is found that some regions undergo reverse transformation although the elastic moduli of the phases are equal and the loading is monotonic. Increase in athermal friction, which is the resistance to interface propagation, is found to delay the phase transformation and different magnitudes of hysteresis are obtained at different friction values. The model predicts the tension-compression asymmetry observed in shape memory alloys. The simulation results are in qualitative agreement with several experimental studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Due to the economic and social aspects, the responsive load behavioural models (RLBMs) might be different in every power market. In this study, linear and nonlinear modellings for the incentive based DR (IBDR) programs and the price-based DR (PBDR) programs are presented and implemented on several real power markets. Herein, results of the implementation of DR programs on the power markets for different participation levels of the responsive load in the DR programs are studied. In addition, value of the possible errors in the defined indices due to unpractical modeling of the responsive load behaviour are probed, and also optimal schemes of the IBDR and PBDR programs are investigated in every power market from different viewpoints.

These processes are normally described by a coupled system of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). To begin with, a desired solid-liquid (S/L) interface geometry is first approximated from a few practical process target parameters that define the desired process properties. Then, the control problem is formulated as one of seeking the optimal combination of process inputs that achieves close tracking of the desired S/L interface in quasi-steady state. The paper details the derivation of the adjoint-based solution for this PDE-constrained multivariable control input optimization problem. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated via a case study on a laser cladding process.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1087-1357	1528-8935		WOS:000369666000001

However, much less attention has been paid to the question of how religion shapes Americans' attitudes toward income inequality and redistributive policies. Using data drawn from the 2013 Economic Values Survey conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI), we explore the role that religion-including religious affiliation, the degree and nature of religiosity, the nexus of politics and religion, and interpretations of biblical text-plays in structuring individuals' attitudes toward government redistribution policies. We find that religious affiliation and participation do not meaningfully shape attitudes toward redistributive policies; however, identification with the "religious right" and specific interpretations of scripture do influence how Americans think about redistribution. These findings provide evidence that standard treatments of religion focusing primarily on affiliation and religiosity may have somewhat limited explanatory power with regard to attitudes about issues that fall outside of the standard "culture wars" framework, at least relative to the explanatory power of more specific expressions of religious belief.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1065-9129	1938-274X		WOS:000369361500011

A variable-volume, high-pressure view cell was used to observe both liquid liquid cloud points as well as bubble points along the liquid liquid vapor (LLV) three-phase line for this system. CO2 + guaiacol was found to exhibit Type III phase behavior according to the classification system of Scott and Van Konynenburg, indicating that even at high pressures the mutual solubility of the two components is relatively low. However, the system does exhibit a pressure minimum in the liquid liquid critical curve at 15 degrees C and pressures just under 500 bar. The upper critical end point U for the CO2-rich liquid phase extends to temperatures and pressures 2.1 degrees C and 2.2 bar above the critical point of CO2. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

We model the integrated production and transportation planning problem of a Tier-1 automotive supplier while taking into account realistic conditions such as sequence-dependent setups on multiple injection molding machines operating in parallel, auxiliary resource assignments of overhead cranes, and multiple types of costs. Finished parts go to the integrated supply chain's second stage, transportation, for subsequent delivery by capacitated vehicles to multiple distribution centers for meeting predefined due date requirements. We develop a mixed-integer, linear programming model of the problem, and then present a hybrid simulated annealing algorithm (HSAA), including a constructive heuristic. Our proposed HSAA employs an effective encoding-decoding strategy to solve the NP-hard problem to near optimality in a timely manner. Computational results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed solution approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Magnetic properties of sulfur-doped graphene								JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS				401				70	76		10.1016/j.jmmm.2015.10.012			MAR 1 2016	2016	While studying magnetism of d- and f-electron systems has been consistently an active research area in physics, chemistry, and biology, there is an increasing interest in the novel magnetism of p-electron systems, especially in graphene and graphene-derived nanostructures. Bulk graphite is diamagnetic in nature, however, graphene is known to exhibit either a paramagnetic response or weak ferromagnetic ordering. Although many groups have attributed this magnetism in graphene to defects or unintentional magnetic impurities, there is a lack of compelling evidence to pinpoint its origin. To resolve this issue, we systematically studied the influence of entropically necessary intrinsic defects (e.g., vacancies, edges) and extrinsic dopants (e.g., S-dopants) on the magnetic properties of graphene. We found that the saturation magnetization of graphene decreased upon sulfur doping suggesting that S-dopants demagnetize vacancies and edges. Our density functional theory calculations provide evidence for: (i) intrinsic defect demagnetization by the formation of covalent bonds between S-dopant and edges/vacancies concurring with the experimental results, and (ii) a net magnetization from only zig-zag edges, suggesting that the possible contradictory results on graphene magnetism in the literature could stem from different defect-types. Interestingly, we observed peculiar local maxima in the temperature dependent magnetizations that suggest the coexistence of different magnetic phases within the same graphene samples.

In this study, the effect of catalytically active Pd nanoparticle (NP) functionalization and subsequent hydrogenation on the hall mobility and carrier density of chemical vapor deposition synthesized graphene has been investigated as a function of temperature. Prior to functionalization, the mobility decreased monotonically as the temperature was reduced from 298 to 10 K, indicating coulomb scattering as the dominant scattering mechanism as expected for bilayer graphene. Similar decreasing trend with temperature was also observed after 2 nm Pd deposition, however, hydrogenation of the Pd NP led to significant enhancement in mobility from similar to 2250 to 3840 cm(2)/V s at room temperature, which further monotonically increased to 5280 cm(2)/V s at 10K. We attribute this contrasting trend in temperature dependent mobility to a switch in the dominant scattering mechanism from coulomb to surface optical (SO) phonon scattering due to higher dielectric constant and polar nature of PdHx formed upon hydrogenation of the Pd NPs.

The mechanism does not break global time-reversal symmetry, as in an antiferromagnet, and results in zero Faraday effect. It is best understood in a phenomenological model of bilayer cuprates, such as YBa2Cu3O6+delta, in which intrabilayer tunneling nucleates a chiral d-density wave such that the individual layers have opposite chirality. Although specific to the chiral d-density wave, the mechanism may be more general to any quasi-two-dimensional orbital antiferromagnet in which time-reversal symmetry is broken in each plane, but not when averaged macroscopically.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2469-9950	2469-9969		WOS:000371398000004

The proportion of patients being bedridden, the average days of being bedridden and the average off-work days were calculated to measure the severity of two-week illness. Rao-Scott-adjusted chi-square test was performed to examine the significance of two-week illness severity differences from demographic variables. Multiple logistic regression and linear regression were used to control for sex, age and household income.Results: The two-week illness prevalence was 22.8 % in Hunan province. Despite similar two-week ill prevalence rates between urban areas and rural areas (23.0 % vs. 22.8 %), rural residents had higher proportions of being bedridden and of being off work than urban residents after controlling for sex, age and household income, with adjusted odds ratios of 3.4 and 6.9, respectively. Similarly, the average days of being bedridden and of being off work in rural residents were 0.45 days and 1.61 days longer than in urban residents after controlling for demographic variables, respectively.Conclusion: The recent data shows that two-week illness in rural residents is more serious than urban residents in Hunan Province, China in spite of very similar two-week prevalence rates. The neglected urban-rural disparities in the severity of two-week illness deserve the attention of health policy-makers and researchers.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1475-9276			WOS:000370925900002	26926446

However, the lack of an efficient, reactive large-area substrate has been one of the major limitations in the development of these materials as advanced functional platforms. Herein, we demonstrate the utility of electrospun poly(glycidyl methacrylate) films as a highly versatile platform for the development of functional nanostructured materials anchored to a surface. The utility of this platform as a reactive substrate is demonstrated by grafting poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) to incorporate stimuli responsive properties. Additionally, we demonstrate that functional nanocomposites can be fabricated using this platform with properties for sensing, fluorescence imaging, and magneto-responsiveness.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1944-8244			WOS:000371105800077	26780245

We tested this prediction with Tunicotheres moseri, an endosymbiotic crab dwelling in the atrial chamber of the morphologically simple, small, and relatively scarce ascidian Styela plicata. As predicted, natural populations of T. moseri inhabit ascidian hosts solitarily with greater frequency than expected by chance alone. Furthermore, laboratory experiments demonstrated that intruder crabs take significantly longer to colonize previously infected compared to uninfected hosts, indicating as expected, that resident crabs exhibit monopolization behaviors. While territoriality does occur, agonistic behaviors employed by T. moseri do not mirror the overt behaviors commonly reported for other territorial crustaceans. Documented double and triple cohabitations in the field coupled with laboratory observations demonstrating the almost invariable success of intruder crabs colonizing occupied hosts, suggest that territoriality is ineffective in completely explaining the solitary social habit of this species. Additional experiments showed that T. moseri juveniles and adults, when searching for ascidians use chemical cues to avoid hosts occupied by conspecifics. This conspecific avoidance behavior reported herein is a novel strategy most likely employed to preemptively resolve costly territorial conflicts. In general, this study supports predictions central to host monopolization theory, but also implies that alternative behavioral strategies (i.e., conflict avoidance) may be more important than originally thought in explaining the host use pattern of symbiotic organisms.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1932-6203			WOS:000371164700007	26910474

Product and carbanion reagent studies suggest that the 3(2H)-furanone is formed in a cascade of reactions involving nucleophilic acyl substitution, enolate formation; trifluoromethyl transfer, iminium or sulfenium ion formation, and subsequent ring closure to form the 3(2H)-furanone. The use of 2-lithio-1,3-dithiane affords a cyclic alpha-keto-S,S,O-orthoester in which the functionality can be selectively manipulated for synthetic applications.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0022-3263			WOS:000370768000007	26756271

This study aimed to determine the role of genotype (G), environments (E), and the interrelationship of genotype and environment (GxE) on soybean seed protein. Three sets of nine soybean genotypes were grown in replicated trials at Maryland, South Carolina, and South Dakota. At each location, the nine genotypes were grown with two planting/sowing dates. We applied two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry to study the variability of soybean storage and allergen proteins. Statistical analysis of 47 storage and 8 allergen proteins, in terms of differentially expressed protein spots significant at the p<0.005 level, was performed. We found more spots that showed statistically significant differences in expression among E compared to G and GXE interaction.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0021-8561	1520-5118		WOS:000370583900026	26807503

Surface Complexation Modeling of Eu(III) and U(VI) Interactions with Graphene Oxide								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				50	4			1821	1827		10.1021/acs.est.5b05307			FEB 16 2016	2016	Graphene oxide (GO) has great potential for actinide removal due to its extremely high sorption capacity, but the mechanism of sorption remains unclear. In this study, the carboxylic functional group and an unexpected sulfonate functional group on GO were characterized as the reactive surface sites and quantified via diffuse layer modeling of the GO acid/base titrations. The presence of sulfonate functional group on GO was confirmed using elemental analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Batch experiments of Eu(III) and U(VI) sorption to GO as the function of pH (1-8) and as the function of analyte concentration (10-100, 000 ppb) at a constant pH approximate to 5 were conducted; the batch sorption results were modeled simultaneously using surface complexation modeling (SCM). The SCM indicated that Eu(III) and U(VI) complexation to carboxylate functional group is the main mechanism for their sorption to GO; their complexation to the sulfonate site occurred at the lower pH range and the complexation of Eu(III) to sulfonate site are more significant than that of U(VI). Eu(III) and U(VI) facilitated GO aggregation was observed with high Eu(III) and U(VI) concentration and may be caused by surface charge neutralization of GO after sorption.									7	1	0	4	0	7			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000370454200022	26752242

Reduction to tetravalent neptunium (Np-IV) effectively immobilizes the actinide in many instances due to its low solubility and strong interactions with natural minerals. One such mineral that may facilitate the reduction of neptunium is magnetite (Fe2+Fe23+O4). Natural magnetites often contain titanium impurities which have been shown to enhance radionuclide sorption via titanium's influence on the Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio (R) in the absence of oxidation. Here, we provide evidence that Ti-substituted magnetite reduces neptunyl species to Np-IV. Titanium substituted magnetite nanoparticles were synthesized and reacted with NpO2+ under reducing conditions. Batch sorption experiments indicate that increasing Ti concentration results in higher Np sorption/reduction values at low pH. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy of the Ti-magnetite particles provides no evidence of NpO2 nanoparticle precipitation. Additionally, X-ray absorption spectroscopy confirms the nearly exclusive presence of Np-IV on the titanomagnetite surface and provides supporting data indicating preferential binding of Np to terminal Ti-O sites as opposed to Fe-O sites.									3	0	0	2	0	3			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000370454200026	26756748

Phonon dispersion relation is calculated based on the lattice dynamics theory. Chirality effect is trivial to the Young's modulus at zero strain but significant to the ultimate strength and Poisson's ratio, regardless of the defects. A phonon band gap of 49 cm(-1) exists in the perfect MoS2 lattice, and reduces to 30.6 cm(-1) in the MoS2 lattice with two sulfur missing vacancy. The phonon band gap reduces with the increasing of tensile strain, regardless of chirality. The failure mode is investigated near the ultimate tensile strength of both the perfect MoS2 lattice and the MoS2 lattice with two sulfur missing vacancy. Regardless of the defect, elastic instability and structural instability are identified for the MoS2 in zigzag direction tension test and armchair direction tension test, respectively. Based on the weakly linear component in the flextural acoustic mode of phonon dispersion, we evaluate the intrinsic critical compressive strain of buckling to be epsilon(c) = 2.0%+/- 0.5% for the perfect MoS2 lattice and demonstrate it numerically from first principles theory calculation.

In this work, a laser-sintering technique is employed to produce persistent luminescent SrAl2O4:Eu2+Dy3+ ceramics that has enhanced translucency in the visible spectral range. In this technique, a CO2 laser was used as the main heating source for sintering with no atmosphere control employed. The ceramics sintered at a power density of 3.1 W/mm(2) yielded homogeneous grain size distributions and transmittance up to 40% in the range of 600-800 nm. Upon sintering in air, the ceramics exhibited the characteristic green emission from the Eu2+ ion, corresponding to the 5d : 4f transition (514 nm) and a weak emission from the Eu3+ ion at 614 nm, corresponding to the D-3(0) -> 7F(2) transition. The valence of europium ions was further studied by the X-ray absorption spectroscopy in the XANES region and those details are reported herein. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

Switching on mTORC1 induces neurogenesis but not proliferation in neural stem cells of young mice								NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS				614				112	118		10.1016/j.neulet.2015.12.042			FEB 12 2016	2016	Recent evidence reported that activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) induces terminal differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) in the neonatal subventricular zone (SVZ), but did not affect their proliferation. Here, we investigated whether such an effect of hyperactive mTORC1 would be recapitulated in young adults following removal of the negative mTORC1 regulator TSC1 as seen in the neurological disorder tuberous sclerosis complex, TSC. Conditional mTORC1 activation in NSCs of 3-4 weeks old mice resulted in the generation of proliferative (Ki67+) cells and newborn neuroblasts. However, hyperactive mTORC1 did not induce NSCs to proliferate, consistent with the findings that mTORC1 induces symmetric division and differentiation of slow-cycling NSCs into proliferative daughter cells. Taken together these data suggest that hyperactivity of mTORC1 could lead to the progressive loss of NSCs over time. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

However, considerable uncertainty remains about the rate of biomass recovery in secondary forests, and how these rates are influenced by climate, landscape, and prior land use(2-4). Here we analyse aboveground biomass recovery during secondary succession in 45 forest sites and about 1,500 forest plots covering the major environmental gradients in the Neotropics. The studied secondary forests are highly productive and resilient. Aboveground biomass recovery after 20 years was on average 122 megagrams per hectare (Mg ha(-1)), corresponding to a net carbon uptake of 3.05 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), 11 times the uptake rate of old-growth forests. Aboveground biomass stocks took a median time of 66 years to recover to 90% of old-growth values. Aboveground biomass recovery after 20 years varied 11.3-fold ( from 20 to 225 Mg ha(-1)) across sites, and this recovery increased with water availability (higher local rainfall and lower climatic water deficit). We present a biomass recovery map of Latin America, which illustrates geographical and climatic variation in carbon sequestration potential during forest regrowth. The map will support policies to minimize forest loss in areas where biomass resilience is naturally low (such as seasonally dry forest regions) and promote forest regeneration and restoration in humid tropical lowland areas with high biomass resilience.									40	0	0	25	0	40			0028-0836	1476-4687		WOS:000369916700037	26840632

First, rms and average currents of insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) and anti-parallel diodes are analytically calculated by considering the associated duty cycle of each IGBT/diode in terms of the converter modulation index, load current, and load power factor. Numerical results of derived closed-form equations to calculate rms and average currents of IGBTs/diodes are compared with simulation results and experimental measurements. All simulation, analytic, and experimental results agree well with each other which validate derived closed-form equations. Afterwards, derived equations for rms and average current computations are utilised to calculate the conduction power losses in a 12.4 MVA, 3.3 kV, nine-level (line-to-line) MFCM converter. A 2.5 kV, 1.5 kA IGBT module from ABB is considered as a power switch in the performed case study for MFCM converter. In addition, switching power loss investigation is performed using numeric approach and curve-fitting method for aforementioned MFCM converter. Comparative analysis and evaluation of conduction and switching losses are presented.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1755-4535	1755-4543		WOS:000371334200005

Understanding cardiac hypertrophy is critical to comprehending the mechanisms of heart development and treatment of heart disease. However, the major molecular event that occurs during physiological or pathological hypertrophy is the dynamic process of sarcomeric addition, and it has not been observed. In this study, a custom-built second harmonic generation (SHG) confocal microscope was used to study dynamic sarcomeric addition in single neonatal CMs in a 3D culture system under acute, uniaxial, static, sustained stretch. Here we report, for the first time, live-cell observations of various modes of dynamic sarcomeric addition (and how these real-time images compare to static images from hypertrophic hearts reported in the literature): 1) Insertion in the mid-region or addition at the end of a myofibril; 2) Sequential addition with an existing myofibril as a template; and 3) Longitudinal splitting of an existing myofibril. The 3D cell culture system developed on a deformable substrate affixed to a stretcher and the SHG live-cell imaging technique are unique tools for real-time analysis of cultured models of hypertrophy.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000369743600002	26861590

The key component in these simulations is the solution of a single load step of a time iteration. From a mathematical perspective, the problems to be solved in each time step are characterized by the difficulties of variational inequalities for both the plastic behavior and the contact problem. Computationally, they also often lead to very large problems. In this paper, we present and evaluate a complete set of methods that are (1) designed to work well together and (2) allow for the efficient solution of such problems. In particular, we use adaptive finite element meshes with linear and quadratic elements, a Newton linearization of the plasticity, active set methods for the contact problem, and multigrid-preconditioned linear solvers. Through a sequence of numerical experiments, we show the performance of these methods. This includes highly accurate solutions of a three-dimensional benchmark problem and scaling our methods in parallel to 1024 cores and more than a billion unknowns.

J	Khanoonkon, Nattaporn; Yoksan, Rangrong; Ogale, Amod A.								Effect of stearic acid-grafted starch compatibilizer on properties of linear low density polyethylene/thermoplastic starch blown film								CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS				137				165	173		10.1016/j.carbpol.2015.10.038			FEB 10 2016	2016	The present work aims to investigate the effect of stearic acid-grafted starch (ST-SA) on the rheological, thermal, optical, dynamic mechanical thermal, and tensile properties of linear low density polyethylene/thermoplastic starch (LLDPE/TPS) blends, as well as on their water vapor and oxygen barrier properties. Blends consisting of LLDPE and TPS in a weight ratio of 60:40 and ST-SA at different concentrations, i.e. 1,3 and 5%, were prepared using a twin-screw extruder. The obtained resins were subsequently converted into films via blown film extrusion. Incorporation of ST-SA resulted in a decreased degree of shear thinning, reduced ambient temperature elasticity, and improved tensile strength, secant modulus, extensibility, and UV absorption, as well as diminished water vapor and oxygen permeabilities of the LLDPE/TPS blend. These effects are attributed to the enhanced interfacial adhesion between LLDPE and TPS phases through the compatibilizing effect induced by ST-SA, and the good dispersion of the TPS phase in the LLDPE matrix. The results confirmed that ST-SA could potentially be used as a compatibilizer for the LLDPE/TPS blend system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This theory is based on the establishment of an itinerant antiferromagnetic state, a low total-energy configuration realized in the presence of the Coulomb interaction enabled by the k = 0 degeneracy of the opposite-spin single-particle energy spectra. Transport in this state is modeled by using the solutions of a Boltzmann equation obtained within the relaxation time approximation. Numerical estimates performed for realistic GaAs samples indicate that at low temperatures, the amplitude of the spin Seebeck coefficient can be increased by scattering on magnetic impurities.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2469-9950	2469-9969		WOS:000369728500005

Measurements were made of the charging potential of the electrical double layer (EDL) capacitance as charge-carrying small molecules translocated the nanopore. Signals in the charging potential were found to be correlated to the physical properties of analyte molecules. From the measured signals, we were able to distinguish molecules with different valence charge or similar valence charge but different size. The relative magnitude of the signals from different analytes was consistent over a wide range of experimental conditions, suggesting that the detected signals are likely due to single molecules. Computational modeling of the nanopore system indicated that the double layer potential signal may be described in terms of disruption of the EDL structure due to the size and charge of the analyte molecule, in agreement with Huckel and Debye's analysis of the electrical atmosphere of electrolyte solutions.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000368935000019	26789241

The lack of internal characters and soft -tissue preservation in many arthropod fossils, however, impedes comprehensive phylogenetic analyses and species descriptions according to taxonomic standards for Recent organisms. We found well-preserved three-dimensional anatomy in mineralized arthropods from Paleogene fissure fillings and demonstrate the value of these fossils by utilizing digitally reconstructed anatomical structure of a hister beetle. The new anatomical data facilitate a refinement of the species diagnosis and allowed us to reject a previous hypothesis of close phylogenetic relationship to an extant congeneric species. Our findings suggest that mineralized fossils, even those of macroscopically poor preservation, constitute a rich but yet largely unexploited source of anatomical data for fossil arthropods.									2	0	0	1	0	2			2050-084X			WOS:000369794900001

Resolving Dynamic Properties of Polymers through Coarse-Grained Computational Studies								PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS				116	5					058302	10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.058302			FEB 5 2016	2016	Coupled length and time scales determine the dynamic behavior of polymers and underlie their unique viscoelastic properties. To resolve the long-time dynamics it is imperative to determine which time and length scales must be correctly modeled. Here we probe the degree of coarse graining required to simultaneously retain significant atomistic details and access large length and time scales. The degree of coarse graining in turn sets the minimum length scale instrumental in defining polymer properties and dynamics. Using linear polyethylene as a model system, we probe how the coarse-graining scale affects the measured dynamics. Iterative Boltzmann inversion is used to derive coarse-grained potentials with 2-6 methylene groups per coarse-grained bead from a fully atomistic melt simulation. We show that atomistic detail is critical to capturing large-scale dynamics. Using these models we simulate polyethylene melts for times over 500 mu s to study the viscoelastic properties of well-entangled polymer melts.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0031-9007	1079-7114		WOS:000369495000020	26894738

Simulium tani Takaoka & Davies is the largest and perhaps the most taxonomically challenging species complex of black flies in the Oriental Region. We use a DNA sequence-based method to delineate currently recognized chromosomal and morphological taxa in the S. tani complex on the Southeast Asian mainland and Taiwan, while elucidating their phylogenetic relationships. A molecular approach using multiple genes, coupled with morphological and chromosomal data, supported recognition of cytoform K and morphoform 'b' as valid species; indicated that S. xuandei, cytoform L, and morphoform 'a' contain possible cryptic species; and suggested that cytoform B is in the early stages of reproductive isolation whereas lineage sorting is incomplete in cytoforms A, C, and G.									3	0	0	3	0	3			2045-2322			WOS:000369796100001	26839292

The effect of supplementing rumen undegradable unsaturated fatty acids on marbling in early-weaned steers								JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE				94	2			833	844		10.2527/jas2015-9809			FEB 2016	2016	The objective of this study was to determine if supplementation with a rumen undegradable unsaturated fatty acids (FA) source improved marbling deposition in early-weaned steers. All steers (Angus, n = 23; Angus x Hereford, n = 24) were weaned at 150 +/- 5 d of age. Steers were blocked by BW and breed and then randomly assigned to either control (CON; average 1.5 kg of corn gluten feed [CGF], n = 23) or isocaloric supplementation containing a rumen undegradable fat source (RUF; 200 g of Megalac-R added to an average of 1.06 kg of CGF, n = 24) offered 5 d/wk for 110 d. All steers had ad libitum access to pastures throughout treatment and received supplements individually. Steer BW and blood samples were collected at 0, 55, and 110 d of supplementation, and real-time ultrasound measurements were collected at d 110. Following treatment, steers were transported to Oklahoma State University for finishing and subsequent harvesting at a commercial plant. All data were analyzed using the PROC MIXED procedure of SAS either as repeated measures or ANOVA depending on parameters. There were no significant changes in BW from the beginning of treatment to harvest due to treatment. Ultrasound data showed that RUF steers tended (P = 0.08) to have more i.m. fat than CON at d 110. Serum concentrations of FA showed a treatment x day interaction (P < 0.02) for 16:0, 18:0, 18:1c-9, 18:2, 20: 4, and total FA. These specific FA concentrations slightly increased in CON steers, but there was a more pronounced increase in the concentration of these FA across the supplementation period in RUF steers. Serum triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations were increased (P < 0.01) on d 55 and 110 in RUF steers compared with those in CON steers. Serum leptin concentration in RUF steers was greater (P < 0.01) than CON steers at d 110. After harvest, RUF carcasses had greater (P = 0.01) marbling scores than those of CON carcasses. All other carcass measures were similar between treatments. The percentage of total lipids was increased (P = 0.011) in steaks from RUF compared to CON. There was a decrease (P < 0.05) in adipocyte diameter in i.m. fat depot of RUF steers compared to CON. There was also a tendency (P = 0.06) for RUF steers to have a greater percentage of 20 to 30 mu m adipocytes in their i.m. depot than CON steers. This study indicates that supplementation of unsaturated FA can positively impact marbling deposition in early-weaned steers without impacting other carcass measures.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-8812	1525-3163		WOS:000374689900039	27065154	
J	Volpi-Lagreca, Gabriela; Duckett, Susan K.								Supplementation of glycerol or fructose via drinking water to enhance marbling deposition and meat quality of finishing cattle								JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE				94	2			858	868		10.2527/jas2015-9872			FEB 2016	2016	Thirty-six Angus-cross steers (667 +/- 34.4 kg initial BW, 24.5 mo) were used to assess the impact of short-term glycerin or high-fructose corn syrup administration via drinking water on meat quality and marbling deposition. Steers blocked by BW (3 blocks) were assigned randomly to 1 of 3 drinking water treatments: 1) control (CON), 2) 4.3% crude glycerin (GLYC), or 3) 4.3% high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) for the final 25 d before slaughter. Average daily gain was lower (P = 0.01) and final live weight was lower (P < 0.01) with HFCS administration compared with CON. Dry matter intake and water intake did not differ among treatments. Fat thickness, muscle depth, and intramuscular fat measured by ultrasound did not differ among treatments. Crude glycerin or HFCS via water supplementation did not alter HCW, dressing percentage, rib eye area, fat thickness, KPH, skeletal maturity, or marbling score. Longissimus muscle and subcutaneous fat color (L*, a*, and b*) were not affected by drinking water treatment. Total lipid content, total fatty acid content, and fatty acid composition of the LM did not differ among drinking water treatments. Supplementation of drinking water with GLYC or HFCS did not alter Warner-Bratzler shear force values or water-holding capacity (drip loss, cook shrink). Intramuscular mean adipocyte diameter was greater (P = 0.02) for steers offered HFCS compared with steers offered GLYC, with CON steers being intermediate. These differences in mean adipocyte size were related to changes in the adipocyte size distribution. There were greater proportions of small (20 to 30 mu m) adipocytes in GLYC compared with HFCS and CON. In contrast, HFCS and CON had greater proportions of medium (40 to 50 mu m) adipocytes than GLYC. The relative mRNA expression of lipogenic genes (acetyl Co-A carboxylase [ACC], fatty acid binding protein 4 [FABP4], fatty acid synthase [FASN], glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase [GPAT], retinol-binding protein 4 [RBP4], and stearoyl-CoA desaturase [SCD]), adipocyte differentiation genes (delta-like 1 homolog [DLK1]), and transcription factors (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha [C/EBP alpha], and PPAR gamma) was similar for GLYC and HFCS compared with CON. Longissimus glycogen and lactate concentrations and glycolytic potential were not affected by drinking water treatments. Overall, HFCS or GLYC supplementation via drinking water did not alter carcass or meat quality variables but did alter the size and distribution of intramuscular adipocytes. These results indicate that a longer supplementation time or a higher substrate level may be needed to obtain differences in meat quality.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-8812	1525-3163		WOS:000374689900041	27065156

This study assessed the presence of these risk factors in limited-resource, community-dwelling older adults to inform the development of a nutrition education interventions. Design: Quantitative descriptive study. Setting: A total of 24 randomly selected congregate nutrition sites (where limited-resource older adults can receive one hot meal/day, five days/week) in the rural state of South Carolina, USA. Participants: Data were collected from 477 older adults (of the 407 who reported race, 219 were African American and 171 were White). Measurements: Extension Educators who work for the Cooperative Extension Service (a formalized educational outreach system associated with some U.S. universities) read aloud a 27-item instrument designed to assess risk factors for malnutrition. Response frequencies were tabulated and chi-square tests were performed using SAS 9.3. Results: More African Americans reported having a chronic illness or condition (81.2 vs. 68.3%; p= 0.003), eating alone (66.2 vs. 53.6%; p= 0.012), having a refrigerator that sometimes did not keep food cold (31.8 vs. 8.4%; p< 0.0001), and sometimes not having enough money to buy food (38.9 vs. 18.5%; p< 0.0001) compared to White older adults. Conclusion: Rural older adults who attend congregate nutrition sites, especially African Americans, could be at risk for malnutrition due to health status and food preparation-related factors. Evidence-based, tailored programs are needed to minimize malnutrition among limited-resource older adults living in rural areas in the U.S..									0	0	0	0	0	0			1279-7707	1760-4788		WOS:000374701200005	26812507

Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped, salivary cortisol samples were collected, and neighborhood SES was calculated using 2010 Census data.Results The sample was mostly female (65 %), with weight classified as overweight or obese (M-BMI=32.74, SD=8.88) and a mean age of 55.64 (SD=15.21). The gene-by-neighborhood SES interaction predicted cortisol (B=0.235, p=.001, r(2)=.036), but not BP. For adults with high genetic, sensitivity waking cortisol was lower with lower SES but higher with higher SES (B=0.87). Lower neighborhood SES was also related to higher systolic BP (B=-0.794, p=.028).Conclusions Findings demonstrated an interaction whereby African-American adults with high genetic sensitivity had high levels of waking cortisol with higher neighborhood SES, and low levels with lower neighborhood SES. This moderation effect is consistent with a differential susceptibility gene-environment pattern, rather than a dual-risk pattern. These findings contribute to a growing body of evidence that demonstrates the importance of investigating complex gene-environment relations in order to better understand stress-related health disparities.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0883-6612	1532-4796		WOS:000373639100010	26685668	
J	Peng, Yunhui; Alexov, Emil								Investigating the linkage between disease-causing amino acid variants and their effect on protein stability and binding								PROTEINS-STRUCTURE FUNCTION AND BIOINFORMATICS				84	2			232	239		10.1002/prot.24968			FEB 2016	2016	Single amino acid variations (SAV) occurring in human population result in natural differences between individuals or cause diseases. It is well understood that the molecular effect of SAV can be manifested as changes of the wild type characteristics of the corresponding protein, among which are the protein stability and protein interactions. Typically the effect of SAV on protein stability and interactions was assessed via the changes of the wild type folding and binding free energies. However, in terms of SAV affecting protein functionally and disease susceptibility, one wants to know to what extend the wild type function is perturbed by the SAV. Here it is demonstrated that relative, rather than the absolute, change of the folding and binding free energy serves as a good indicator for SAV association with disease. Using HumVar as a source for disease-causing SAV and experimentally determined free energy changes from ProTherm and SKEMPI databases, correlation coefficients (CC) between the disease index (P-d) and relative folding (P-p(r,f)) and binding (P-p(r,b)) probability indexes, respectively, was achieved. The obtained CCs demonstrated the applicability of the proposed approach and it served as good indicator for SAV association with disease.

In this study, we isolated and characterized SIDP361, which encodes a DUF1644 family protein. This gene was expressed in various rice tissues and was induced by high salt (200 mM NaCl), dehydration, and abscisic acid (100 A mu M ABA) treatments. Stable expression of SIDP361-GFP in rice cells suggested that SIDP361 is a cytoplasmic protein. When compared with the untransformed wild-type (WT) control, transgenic plants over-expressing SIDP361 exhibited significantly improved tolerance to salt stress at both the seedling and heading stages. Under salinity conditions, the transgenics also had elevated amounts of free proline. Moreover, transcript levels for genes encoding proline synthetase enzymes were significantly higher in transformants than in the WT. The transgenic lines were also hypersensitive to exogenous ABA. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that transcription of several stressrelated genes was greater in SIDP361-overexpressing plants than in the WT under both normal and salt-stressed conditions. These results demonstrate that SIDP361 has high potential as a tool for genetically improving salt tolerance in rice.									0	1	0	0	0	1			1226-9239	1867-0725		WOS:000369278700007

Sensor measurements were compared to the soil color chart by converting the Nix Pro values to Munsell soil color codes using BabelColor conversion software. Thirty-one Cecil (Fine, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kanhapludults) soil samples were collected and tested for color. Munsell color codes were converted into cyan, magenta, yellow, and black (CMYK) color values, and the Nix sensor's scan results were tested against predetermined Munsell color values and colorimeter CMYK color values using correlation analysis for all treatments. Nix Pro Color Sensor was precise in soil color determination and it was more accurate than the Munsell Color Chart and comparable to the Konica Minolta CR-400 for both dry and moist soil. The Munsell Color Chart was accurate compared to the Konica Minolta CR-400 in dry soil, but it was less accurate in moist soil. The Nix Pro Color Sensor can be a successful tool to measure soil color in the standard Munsell color codes and this study presents a step-by-step method for converting sensor measurements to the standard Munsell color codes.

Core self-evaluations and subjective well-being in the US and the Philippines: The moderating role of self-construal								SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY				57	1			50	56		10.1111/sjop.12265			FEB 2016	2016	Extant literature has shown that the compound personality variable core self-evaluations (CSE) is associated with various psychological outcomes. However, there is a dearth of research on CSE across cultures. Consistent with self-construal theory, because there can be differences in self-construals within and between cultures, the present study examined the moderating role of culture on the relation between CSE and subjective well-being while also allowing for individual differences in self-construal in the US and the Philippines. In both countries, CSE positively predicted subjective well-being. Notably, the association between CSE and subjective well-being was stronger in the US than in the Philippines. In addition, independent self-construal strengthened the positive impact of CSE on subjective well-being especially in the US. Overall, CSE positively predicts subjective well-being; however, the relationship depends on not only the cultural context, but also on individual differences in self-construal.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0036-5564	1467-9450		WOS:000372356400007

Rapid wood decay and nutrient mineralization in an old-growth bottomland hardwood forest								BIOGEOCHEMISTRY				127	2-3			323	338		10.1007/s10533-016-0183-y			FEB 2016	2016	Downed woody debris is an important component of the forest floor, responsible for long-term storage of nutrients in many ecosystems. In large floodplain forests of the southeastern United States, wood loads are relatively low, suggesting these landscapes may promote rapid decomposition and nutrient turnover rates. The goals of this study were to identify the major factors responsible for wood decomposition and associated nutrient dynamics in an old-growth floodplain forest at Congaree National Park, South Carolina (USA). In situ decomposition and nutrient dynamics were quantified for 700 days (April 2011-March 2013) using wood from a common overstory species, red maple (Acer rubrum L.). During the study period, regional drought conditions allowed red imported fire ant (RIFA, Solenopsis invicta Buren) colonization and infestation of the study wood after 183 days in the field. Carbon (C) content decreased throughout the study, indicating net mineralization was occurring year-round. Invertebrate activity contributed to extremely fast decomposition rates (mean k 0.650 +/- A 0.02 year(-1)) and wood turnover times (mean 4.79 +/- A 0.15 years). In contrast to C, wood nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) content increased following RIFA infestation, displaying net nutrient immobilization. The rapid turnover rates measured at CONG indicate that the C storage function of woody debris may be diminished, but availability of mineralized N and P may also have increased the importance of wood stocks to support forest net primary productivity.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0168-2563	1573-515X		WOS:000371606000011

Winter survival of female American Black Ducks in Tennessee, USA								CONDOR				118	1			33	45		10.1650/CONDOR-15-74.1			FEB 2016	2016	Many migratory bird species, including the American Black Duck (Anas rubripes; hereafter black duck), face challenges to their survival during winter due to potentially limited resources and high energetic demands. These winter processes can be especially important for the population dynamics of migratory species. Despite stabilization of the overall black duck breeding population, historical declines continue for black ducks wintering in the Mississippi Flyway. It remains unclear if declining abundance in this region reflects high winter mortality. We radio-tagged 111 females in the Tennessee National Wildlife Refuge (TNWR), a major wintering area for mid-continent Mississippi Flyway black ducks, from December to February of 2010-2012 to estimate winter survival and investigate factors that may influence survival rates, including body mass, age, hunting period, and weather. Winter survival (0.83-0.85) was greater than or comparable with previous estimates for black duck populations in North America. Generally, birds with greater body mass had higher survival than birds of lesser body mass; a bird 100 g heavier than one of average body mass had 18% greater interval survival. We also found that body mass had a greater influence on survival during late (nonhunting) periods and a more severe winter, when resources potentially were limited. For example, a bird with a body mass 100 g above average had 9% greater interval survival than one of average body mass during the winter of 2010-2011, but in the subsequent milder winter, the heavier bird had similar survival to the bird of average body mass. Our results suggest that winter mortality is not a primary factor contributing to declining abundance of black ducks in the TNWR. If this reflects the general pattern in the Mississippi Flyway, declining regional abundance may be driven by movement patterns or cross-seasonal effects rather than winter mortality.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0010-5422	1938-5129		WOS:000371609400004

Its improved ORR and HER activities in 0.1 M KOH were confirmed using a thin-film rotating ring-disk electrode (TF-RRDE) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The exchange current density and Tafel slope obtained from EIS data for HER are 1.6 x 10 (2) mAcm (2). and similar to 43 mV dec (1) respectively, suggesting Volmer-Heyrovsky mechanism for HER. In addition to its good durability for both cathodic processes, catalyst shows a 4-electron transfer process for ORR, excellent tolerance towards methanol oxidation, and low H2O2 formation (similar to 3.0%). At half-wave potential of 0.8 V, no significant degradation was observed after 10,000 (0.65 - 1.0V) potential cycles in oxygen saturated medium. A catalyst of such benign properties is highly indispensable for energy conversion systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Of 59 taxa surveyed, freshly harvested terminal cuttings of Begonia hybrid 'Snowcap', Lantana camara L. 'Patriot Sunbeam', and Portulaca oleracea L. 'Fairytales Sleeping Beauty' were sensitive to exogenous application of 1 mu L.L-1 ethylene, as demonstrated by leaf abscission within 24 hours of treatment. Exposure to 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) at 700 mu L.L-1 for 4 hours before ethylene treatment prevented ethylene injury in these species/cultivars. Exposing unrooted cuttings to 700 mu L.L-1 1-MCP induced significant endogenous ethylene biosynthesis in terminal cuttings of the five taxa tested: Euphorbia pulcherrima Willd. ex Klotzsch 'Visions of Grandeur', Impatiens hawkeri W. Bull 'Sonic Red', Pelargonium peltatum (L.) L'Herit. 'Mandarin', Pelargonium x hortorum Bailey (pro sp.) [inquinans x zonale] 'Rocky Mountain White', and Petunia xhybrida Vilm. 'Suncatcher Coral Prism'. Exogenous 1 mu L.L-1 ethylene improved adventitious rooting in two cultivars: Begonia hybrid Anita Louise and Fuchsia triphylla L. Honeysuckle. Other trials showed that 1-MCP exposure reduced root number and length of P. xhortorum 'Kardino' and delayed adventitious rooting in all six cultivars tested: Angelonia angustifolia Benth. 'Carita Lavender', Calibrachoa xhybrida Llave & Lex. 'Terra Cotta', L hawkeri 'Sonic Red', P. oleracea 'Fairytales Sleeping Beauty', Sutera cordata Kuntze 'Abunda Blue Improved', and Verbena xhybrida Groenl. & Ruempl. 'Aztec Wild Rose'. Subsequent exposure to 1 mu L.L-1 ethylene partially mitigated the negative effects on rooting from exposing cuttings to 1-MCP.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0018-5345	2327-9834		WOS:000371750300008

CSR MOTIVATIONS AND ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE								STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL				37	2			262	279		10.1002/smj.2348			FEB 2016	2016	This study builds on insights from both upper echelons and agency perspectives to examine the effects on corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices of CEO's narcissism. Drawing on prior theory about CEO narcissism, we argue that CSR can be a response to leaders' personal needs for attention and image reinforcement and hypothesize that CEO narcissism has positive effects on levels and profile of organizational CSR; additionally, CEO narcissism will reduce the effect of CSR on performance. We find support for our ideas with a sample of Fortune 500 CEOs, operationalizing CEO narcissism with a novel media-based measurement technique that uses third-party ratings of CEO characteristics with validated psychometric scales.

J	Alsallaiy, Ibtehal; Dawson, Paul; Han, Inyee; Martinez-Dawson, Rose								Recovery, Survival and Transfer of Bacteria on Restaurant Menus								JOURNAL OF FOOD SAFETY				36	1			52	61		10.1111/jfs.12212			FEB 2016	2016	The objectives of this study were to detect bacteria on restaurant menus, to determine the bacterial transfer from menus to consumers' hands and to determine the survival of bacteria on menu surfaces. Local restaurant menus were sampled at different periods of operation. The average total plate count (TPC) was 28 (0-210) cfu/15cm(2) menu sampling area during busy periods and 15 (0-85) cfu/15cm(2) menu sampling area during less busy periods. The staphylococcal count averaged 6 (0-83) cfu/15cm(2) during busy periods and 2 (0-25) cfu/15cm(2) menu sampling area during less busy periods. Escherichia coli was transferred to menus at 11.17% of the hand population with a high variability between subjects (10.45% standard deviation). Survival of bacteria in menus was 1.40% after 24h and 1.34% after 48h, respectively. Bacterial populations found on randomly sampled menus were low; however, bacteria survived and were transferred from menus to a consumer's hands.Practical ApplicationsWhile many food-contact surfaces are routinely cleaned and sanitized to minimize the presence of contamination, some surfaces such as restaurant menus are not and thus may be a potential contamination risk. The current study revealed that in the relatively small sample size of menus examined, there were some that were contaminated. Furthermore, there was measurable transfer of bacteria present on menus to consumer's hands and bacteria survived on menus at least 2 days. Therefore, to reduce the chance of illness from menus that are touched by many different people, especially food service workers, menus may be considered to be included as part of a standard sanitation operating procedure.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0149-6085	1745-4565		WOS:000369340100006

Indirect evidence of its presence in vivo exists, but few functional studies have been published. This review describes the current knowledge of fibroblast-myocyte electrical signaling in the heart. Further research is needed to understand the frequency and extent of heterocellular interactions in vivo in order to gain a better understanding of their relevance in healthy and diseased myocardium. It is hoped that associated insight into myocyte-fibroblast coupling in the heart may lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic targets and the development of agents for improving outcomes of myocardial scarring and fibrosis.

Three sensing grating structures were inscribed along a single-mode optical fiber using a femtosecond laser, bound together into a sensing array using thermoformed plastic, and fixed to a two-axis rotational stage. Inclination tests were performed in which the fiber was deflected from 0 to 1.7 deg. These tests were repeated at eight azimuthal angles in increments of 45 deg (from 0 to 315 deg). The standard deviation of the largest inclination angle error was 0.048 deg and the stability of the inclination angle was 0.030 deg.

Results indicated that the hardness of low-fat sausages with no tomato powder (LFN) was significantly higher (P<0.05) than that of the other groups, and springiness decreased slightly at a higher powder level. During storage, the polyunsaturated/saturated fatty acid ratio of high-fat samples with no powder (HFN) and low-fat samples with no powder (LFN) decreased significantly relative to that of the other sausage samples (P<0.05). Furthermore, a slight increase in yellowness was detected in most samples. Low-fat sausage with powder prepared by airflow ultra-micro crushing had lightness and redness values of 54.26 and 11.36, respectively. Thus, these values can be increased effectively by adding a small amount of tomato peel powder treated by the airflow ultra-microcrushing method. Practical applications: Tomato peel, an undervalued agro-industrial waste of the tomato juice industry, contains non-digestible fiber content that offers several physiological effects and therapeutic applications. To the best of our knowledge no studies have reported on the application of tomato powder as a fat analog in sausage and its contribution to the fatty acid and textural quality of sausage. The study reported here investigates the interactions between particles of tomato powder and fat levels on the overall quality of sausages. Comparison of two different crushing systems show that TBARS of sausage containing airflow ultra-micro crushing-prepared tomato peel powder is higher than that of the sausages with conventional mechanical crushing-prepared powder. Low-fat sausage with powder prepared by airflow ultra-micro crushing had lightness and redness. Overall, incorporation of tomato peel powder in the formulation successfully reduced the animal fat and improved the color and TBARS values of the final product.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1438-7697	1438-9312		WOS:000369845000007

The aging model is then used to construct the severity factor map, used to characterize relative aging of the battery under different operating conditions. This is used as a battery degradation criterion within a multi-objective optimization problem where battery aging minimization is to be achieved along with fuel consumption minimization. The method proposed is general and can be applied to other battery chemistry as well as different vehicular applications. Finally, simulations conducted using a hybrid electric vehicle simulator show how the two modeling tools developed in this paper, i.e., the severity factor map and the aging model, can be effectively used in a multi-objective optimization problem to predict and control battery degradation.

We assume that the user devices are multimodal, which makes it possible for each device to use any available access point (AP)/base station (BS) of a RAT at any given time. Through detailed protocol level simulations performed in ns-2, we show an increase in spectral efficiency of up to 99 percent and an increase in short-term fairness of up to 28.5 percent for two greedy sort-based user device-to-AP/BS association algorithms implemented at the GRC compared to a distributed solution used in practice today where each user makes his/her own association decision. While the increase in overhead due to re-associations for a centralized solution grows only slightly (by up to 4.1 percent) compared to a distributed solution, we find the performance increase in spectral efficiency and short-term fairness attributes come at the cost of an order of magnitude increase (of up to 794 percent) in energy consumption.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1536-1233	1558-0660		WOS:000370758000003

JOURNAL OF CORPORATE FINANCE				36				255	277		10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2015.12.003			FEB 2016	2016	Building on recent theory, we find strong and robust evidence that external labor market incentives motivate CEOs to adopt more aggressive tax policies in order to improve firm performance and their own labor market value. In addition, we find that the tax aggressiveness labor market incentives relation varies in the cross-section consistently with theory. We find that the relation is attenuated in industries for which the CEO has fewer outside employment options, and we find it to be amplified in industries for which competition for CEO talent is likely greatest, and also among CEOs estimated to have greater ability. Overall, our results suggest that the market for CEOs - an incentive device external to the firm - has a meaningful impact on corporate tax policy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

CACC systems have been attracting significant attention from both academia and industry since connectivity between vehicles will become mandatory for new vehicles in the USA in the near future. In this paper, we review three basic and important aspects of CACC systems: communications, driver characteristics, and controls to identify the most challenging issues for their real-world deployment. Different routing protocols that support the data communication requirements between vehicles in the CACC platoon are reviewed. Promising and suitable protocols are identified. Driver characteristics related issues, such as how to keep drivers engaged in driving tasks during CACC operations, are discussed. To achieve mass acceptance, the control design needs to depict real-world traffic variability such as communication effects, driver behavior, and traffic composition. Thus, this paper also discusses the issues that existing CACC control modules face when considering close to ideal driving conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1524-9050	1558-0016		WOS:000370531000018

Structure of the Lepidopteran Proboscis in Relation to Feeding Guild								JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY				277	2			167	182		10.1002/jmor.20487			FEB 2016	2016	Most butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera) use modified mouthparts, the proboscis, to acquire fluids. We quantified the proboscis architecture of five butterfly species in three families to test the hypothesis that proboscis structure relates to feeding guild. We used scanning electron microscopy to elucidate the fine structure of the proboscis of both sexes and to quantify dimensions, cuticular patterns, and the shapes and sizes of sensilla and dorsal legulae. Sexual dimorphism was not detected in the proboscis structure of any species. A hierarchical clustering analysis of overall proboscis architecture reflected lepidopteran phylogeny, but did not produce a distinct group of flower visitors or of puddle visitors within the flower visitors. Specific characters of the proboscis, nonetheless, can indicate flower and nonflower visitors, such as the configuration of sensilla styloconica, width of the lower branches of dorsal legulae, presence or absence of dorsal legulae at the extreme apex, and degree of proboscis tapering. We suggest that the overall proboscis architecture of Lepidoptera reflects a universal structural organization that promotes fluid uptake from droplets and films. On top of this fundamental structural organization, we suggest that the diversity of floral structure has selected for structural adaptations that facilitate entry of the proboscis into floral tubes.

It is based on the use of paper spots loaded with colloidal CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (Q-dots) and the enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx). Circular paper sheets were uniformly loaded with Q-dots and then displayed strong fluorescence under a UV lamp (365 nm exCitation). The action of GOx causes the production of H2O2 which, after a typical exposure time of 20 min, causes fluorescence intensity to be quenched. To obtain a reading, the paper sheets were photographed under 365 nm excitation using a digital camera. Several parameters, including the amount of Q-dots, sample pH, and amount of GOx were optimized to maximize the response to glucose. The paper-based assay showed a sigmoidal-shaped response with respect to the glucose concentration in the 5-200 mg center dot dL(-1) range (limit of detection of 5 mu g center dot dL(-1)), demonstrating their potential use for biomedical applications.									4	0	0	1	0	4			0026-3672	1436-5073		WOS:000370176500012	27057067

Utility of a Cucumber Plant Bioassay to Assess Fungicide Efficacy Against Pseudoperonospora cubensis								PLANT DISEASE				100	2			490	499		10.1094/PDIS-05-15-0499-RE			FEB 2016	2016	Over a dozen fungicides are registered in the United States to manage cucurbit downy mildew caused by Pseudoperonospora cubensis. Efficacy varies greatly among them, due, in part, to reduced sensitivity to some fungicides in some pathogen populations. The objective of this study was to determine whether fungicide efficacy could be assessed using fungicide-treated cucumber (Cucumis sativus) exposed to natural inoculum for a brief period. Potted cucumber plants were treated with water or 1 of 13 fungicides registered to control cucurbit downy mildew. One day later, they were placed in a field among cucumber plants that had symptoms and signs of downy mildew. After a 48-h exposure to P. cubensis, potted plants were moved to a growth chamber held at day and night temperatures of 21 and 18 degrees C, respectively, and 50% relative humidity. Severity (leaf area with symptoms) of downy mildew was rated 5 and 7 days later. The assay was done eight times, twice each in July and October 2013 and 2014. Year, season, trial, and interactions among these factors affected downy mildew development. Severity at 7 days on plants treated with mandipropamid, azoxystrobin, dimethomorph, cymoxanil, fluopicolide, and propamocarb was not significantly different from the water control treatment in eight, five, three, three, two, and two of eight bioassays, respectively. Severity on plants treated with cyazofamid, fluazinam, mancozeb + zoxamide, mancozeb, chlorothalonil, and ametoctradin + dimethomorph was less than on plants treated with water in all bioassays. These six fungicides should be effective when applied early in the season to prevent initial infections. Cyazofamid and mancozeb + zoxamide prevented an increase in severity between rating times. In conclusion, the assay consistently detected resistance to mandipropamid and azoxystrobin and demonstrated the efficacy of six other fungicides.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0191-2917	1943-7692		WOS:000370305300032		
J	Simpson, Amber; Quigley, Cassie F.								Member Checking Process with Adolescent Students: Not Just Reading a Transcript								QUALITATIVE REPORT				21	2			377	392					FEB 2016	2016	This paper explores the way in which educational researchers created a member checking process with adolescent students during a study to uncover and understand female and male's dynamic mathematics identity in single-sex and coeducational mathematics classes within a public coeducational middle school in the United States. The authors developed a member checking process that included I-poems and Word Trees, which provided the youth with opportunities for self-reflection, enhancement of findings, examination of the students' learning, and as a way to shift some of the power from the researcher to the participants. This paper serves as an example for other researchers to begin thinking about the important process of member checking and participants' roles in the research.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2160-3715			WOS:000370595500012

Simplified Finite-Element Model for Site Response Analysis of Unsaturated Soil Profiles								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMECHANICS				16	1					04015036	10.1061/(ASCE)GM.1943-5622.0000489			FEB 2016	2016	A numerically stable and computationally efficient finite-element model for analyzing the dynamic response of unsaturated soil profiles in terms of total stresses is presented in this paper. The highly nonlinear, fully coupled governing differential equations are simplified by neglecting the relative accelerations and velocities of the pore fluids, and the simplified formulation is improved by incorporating an external viscous damping formulation for unsaturated soil. The surface spectral accelerations computed using the proposed model are qualitatively compared with that of DEEPSOIL and PLAXIS following a comparison of surface spectral accelerations computed using the underdamped and the damped simplified formulations. A detailed parametric study of the effect of viscous damping parameters and both elastoplastic and elastic constitutive models is also presented. A simplified soil-pile interaction study is presented to show the effect of soil-pile interaction on the computed responses. Analysis reveals that the proposed model is applicable to the seismic site response analysis of unsaturated soil profiles.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1532-3641	1943-5622		WOS:000370074100019

Uniform Gradient Element Formulation with Hourglass Control Scheme for Solving Fully Coupled Finite-Element Equations for Saturated Soils								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMECHANICS				16	1					04015019	10.1061/(ASCE)GM.1943-5622.0000490			FEB 2016	2016	A uniform gradient (UG) element formulation for a four-node quadrilateral element is derived and implemented for solving the fully coupled governing equations for the dynamics of a saturated porous medium. An hourglass control scheme is also derived for eliminating the hourglass modes that arise when using the UG element formulation. The effectiveness of the new formulations is investigated by simulating the quasi-static and dynamics response of a footing and the dynamic response of an earth dam. The results show that the level of excitation of hourglass modes is problem-dependent and mesh-dependent. The proposed method for controlling the hourglass modes is shown to be effective with minimal effect on the computed response.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1532-3641	1943-5622		WOS:000370074100020

Their importance in biology and engineering has motivated numerous studies aiming to understand the basic synchronization properties of a network of PCOs. In this work, we study synchronization of PCOs subject to a global pacemaker (or global cue) and local interactions between slave oscillators. We characterize solutions and give synchronization conditions using the phase response curve (PRC) as the design element, which is restricted to be of the delay type in the first half of the cycle, interval (0, pi), and of the advance type in the second half of the cycle, interval (pi, 2 pi). It is shown that global synchronization is feasible when using an advance-delay PRC if the influence of the global cue is strong enough. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the analytical findings. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0167-6911	1872-7956		WOS:000370101400010

The indirect effect of children's gender on early childhood educators' mathematical talk								TEACHING AND TEACHER EDUCATION				54				44	53		10.1016/j.tate.2015.11.011			FEB 2016	2016	The purpose of this study is to examine how teachers might engage in mathematical talk differently with boys and girls within an early childhood classroom setting; therefore, possibly building and maintaining the stereotype of mathematics as a male domain. Utilizing a multi-model approach, results suggests minimal differences in the extent in which teachers in this study engaged in mathematical talk with girls and boys in class. However, any noted differences in mathematical talk and questions seem dependent upon the classroom contexts (i.e., whole-class, small group, and center time).

Existing systems, however, can be criticized for their limited applicability and scope. First, card-based systems have not been successful in the production environments that are arguably most in need of their help: complex job shops that produce low-volume, high-variety products. Second, while most existing systems simplify shop floor control, other planning tasks - such as the estimation of short, feasible due dates during customer enquiry management - are not supported. To overcome these limitations, a card-based version of Workload Control - known as COBACABANA (COntrol of BAlance by CArd-BAsed Navigation) - was recently proposed that uses cards for both due date estimation and order release control. This unique combination makes COBACABANA a potentially important means of controlling production, particularly for small job shops with limited resources. However, the original approach had several shortcomings. This paper refines the due date estimation procedure of COBACABANA to make it more practical and consistent with the order release method applied. It then uses simulation to demonstrate - for the first time - the potential of COBACABANA as an integrated concept that combines customer enquiry management and order release control to improve job shop performance. Results also suggest that the need for processing time estimations can be simplified, further facilitating the implementation of COBACABANA in practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The military uses jamming attacks as a tool to attack and disrupt terrorist's communications, because the open nature of wireless networks makes them vulnerable to various attacks. Many studies and a few survey papers are available in the literature, but none of these papers classify the attacks or the defense strategies by the type of wireless network affected, the attacker or defender's perspective, the type of game used to model the problem, such as Bayesian game, Stackelberg game, or the type of solution methodology, such as mathematical programming model and algorithm. This paper provides a comprehensive survey and a taxonomic classification to help interested researchers find the gaps in the literature and guide them to research areas that need to be explored.

The combination of regular and surge demand can be observed in many areas, such as healthcare inventory and humanitarian supply chain management. The arrival rate of regular demand is typically higher than the arrival rate of surge demand, whereas the volume of regular demand is typically lower than the volume of surge demand. This paper proposes an inventory management model that considers both emergency and regular replenishments corresponding to both demand patterns. The equilibrium equations developed for this model are based on the level crossing theory. These equations are used to develop a search-based heuristics to identify near optimal inventory management policies. Numerical results show that the proposed hybrid inventory policy with split delivery outperforms similar hybrid inventory policy without split delivery when holding and shortage costs are relatively low.

Comparative limb bone loading in the humerus and femur of the tiger salamander: testing the 'mixed-chain' hypothesis for skeletal safety factors								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY				219	3			341	353		10.1242/jeb.125799			FEB 1 2016	2016	Locomotion imposes some of the highest loads upon the skeleton, and diverse bone designs have evolved to withstand these demands. Excessive loads can fatally injure organisms; however, bones have a margin of extra protection, called a 'safety factor' (SF), to accommodate loads that are higher than normal. The extent to which SFs might vary amongst an animal's limb bones is unclear. If the limbs are likened to a chain composed of bones as 'links', then similar SFs might be expected for all limb bones because failure of the system would be determined by the weakest link, and extra protection in other links could waste energetic resources. However, Alexander proposed that a 'mixed-chain' of SFs might be found amongst bones if: (1) their energetic costs differ, (2) some elements face variable demands, or (3) SFs are generally high. To test whether such conditions contribute to diversity in limb bone SFs, we compared the biomechanical properties and locomotor loading of the humerus and femur in the tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum). Despite high SFs in salamanders and similar sizes of the humerus and femur that would suggest similar energetic costs, the humerus had lower bone stresses, higher mechanical hardness and larger SFs. SFs were greatest in the anatomical regions where yield stresses were highest in the humerus and lowest in the femur. Such intraspecific variation between and within bones may relate to their different biomechanical functions, providing insight into the emergence of novel locomotor capabilities during the invasion of land by tetrapods.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000369537800014	26596535

We have recently described the modification of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) C-CP fibers to affect amine-rich phases for the weak anion-exchange (WAX) separation of proteins. Polyethylenimine (PEI) is covalently coupled to the PET surface, with subsequent cross-linking imparted by treatment with 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BUDGE). These modifications yield vastly improved dynamic binding capacities over the unmodified fibers. We have also previously employed native (unmodified) nylon 6 C-CP fibers as weak anion/cation-exchange (mixed-mode) and hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) phases for protein separations. Polyamide, nylon 6, consists of amide groups along the polymer backbone, with primary amines and carboxylic acid end groups. The analytical separation characteristics of these three amine-based C-CP fiber phases are compared here. Each of the C-CP fiber columns in this study was shown to be able to separate a bovine serum albumin/hemoglobin/lysozyme mixture at high mobile phase linear velocity (similar to 70 mm s(-1)) but with different elution characteristics. These differences reflect the types of protein-surface interactions that are occurring, based on the active group composition of the fiber surfaces. This study provides important fundamental understanding for the development of surface-modified C-CP fiber columns for protein separation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1618-2642	1618-2650		WOS:000368815200009	26345444

FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT				361				339	345		10.1016/j.foreco.2015.11.030			FEB 1 2016	2016	Unlike most plants that increase size with age, species in bamboo subfamily have a unique growth pattern and their vegetative sprouts reach adult size during the first growing season. However, the adult size of bamboo varies greatly among species, and the range of sizes among different bamboo species may be an analog to the range of size of a non-bamboo tree species due to its growth with age. Therefore, we hypothesize that the self-thinning rule developed for individual plant species can be applied to describe the size density relationship among different bamboo species. To test this hypothesis, we quantified the size density relationship using data collected from 50 bamboo species in fully stocked stands and compared this relationship with the self-thinning rule. The 50 bamboo species included 10 dwarf bamboo species, 20 shrubby bamboo species, and 20 woody bamboo species, with their size covered almost the entire size range within the bamboo subfamily. In addition to biomass, ground diameter (GD) was also used as a measure of size in our study because of its close relationship with biomass. Our results indicate that the self -thinning rule described the size density relationship very well, with a slope of 1.184 that is slightly lower than 3/2. We conclude that size differences among bamboo species, instead of the conventional size differences due to growth with age within a single species, can be used to develop the self -thinning rule for bamboo subfamily. Compared to the biomass, the ground diameter resulted in a better fit with density, suggesting that ground diameter should be used as the measure of size when studying size density relationship for bamboos.

Although prevalent in the Atlantic Coastal Plain, roadside ditches adjacent to pine plantations have had few surveys of vertebrate diversity and little is known about local and landscape level effects of silvicultural activities on species assemblages. Our goal was to investigate richness and occupancy of amphibians and reptiles in an intensively managed forest landscape with a history of silvicultural alterations of aquatic habitat types, including ditching, draining, and periodic maintenance of ditches for optimizing loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) growth. We selected 15 roadside ditches that were maintained 3-17 years earlier and were embedded in a matrix of pine plantations in eastern North Carolina, USA. We conducted repeated, visual encounter surveys of roadside ditches during 2012-2013 and detected 25 species of amphibians and reptiles 447 times including five species of statewide conservation concern. We used a Bayesian, hierarchical, community occupancy model with group-specific hyper-parameters to estimate occupancy probabilities and species richness while accounting for imperfect detection. With our model, we examined effects of time since ditch maintenance, amount of nearby mature forest, and amount of adjacent wet-lands on species richness and occupancy. We predicted species would respond positively to an intermediate period of time since ditch maintenance and positively to landscape covariates related to mature forest and wetlands. Our model estimated species richness of anurans from 0.9 to 7.4 species/ditch segment, snakes and lizards from 0.8 to 9.0 species/ditch segment, and turtles from 0.9 to 5.1 species/ditch segment. Contrary to our predictions, occupancy of herpetofauna showed no evidence of a relationship to time since ditch maintenance, and landscape metrics only influenced occupancy of one turtle species. Detection probabilities were influenced by season for several anurans, snakes, and lizards, but not turtles. Our results indicate that aquatic habitat types embedded in managed forests that were hydrologically and structurally altered for silviculture can support local occupancy of a relatively diverse herpetofaunal community and that temporal proximity to ditch maintenance had little effect on occupancy or richness.

AUTOMOTIVE STEERING SYSTEM PREFERENCES EVALUATED USING A DRIVING SIMULATOR								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY				17	1			71	81		10.1007/s12239-016-0006-0			FEB 2016	2016	The automotive steering system is the primary channel through which road and vehicle behavior feedback is transmitted to the driver. While the driver provides directional platform control through the steering wheel, perceptions of the vehicle's handling responsiveness are simultaneously transmitted back to the driver allowing for correction of any instabilities the vehicle may encounter. Based on these factors, drivers often pay special attention to the steering system when deciding what vehicle to purchase. Therefore, a significant amount of effort and time is invested in attempting to determine the optimal design of steering system components and configurations. In this study, the determination of an optimal steering configuration was attempted based on responses obtained from questionnaires that subjects answered. The questions were designed to evaluate the degree of satisfaction regarding the "control", "ease of operation", and "fun" participants experienced after each driving run. During the study, human subjects drove a driving simulator for 15 combinations of 3 different roadway environments and 5 different steering configurations, filling out a questionnaire after each scenario. The subjects were also classified as a type of driver ("utility", "enthusiast", and/or "performance"). The study attempted to determine if the mean values of questionnaire responses for "control", "ease", and "fun" type of questions changed as the scenario and/or driver type changed. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to determine if the mean values of the three types of questions were statistically different. The overall results suggest that the average responses for vehicle "control", "ease", and the "fun" type of questions were dependent on the type of roadway environment; however, only the responses for "fun" type of questions were influenced by the given steering configurations. Indeed, the steering system can impact the driver's perceptions of the vehicle's operational experience.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1229-9138	1976-3832		WOS:000368961600006

In this work, a cone penetration test (CPT)-based approach for the evaluation of liquefaction potential is presented where the soil spatial variability is explicitly considered through internally-consistent probabilistic models developed at multiple scales. The novelty of the proposed work comes from the integration of the classical empirically-developed liquefaction criteria with tools in geostatistics and novel multiscale random-field models. A unique feature of the proposed work is its ability to refine and obtain higher resolution random fields for soil properties in critical areas, such as those adjacent to important infrastructure or in areas with detailed small-scale field data. An illustrative example assessing the liquefaction potential at various shaking levels in the Marina District of San Francisco is used to demonstrate the capability of the proposed method.

Hydrologic Characterization of an Underdrained Porous Pavement								JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING				21	2						10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0001303			FEB 2016	2016	The hydrologic behavior of an underdrained porous pavement system was characterized using an effective curve number (ECN), which is synonymous to the common runoff curve number (RCN). A model previously developed for porous pavements without an underdrain, which generates the rainfall-runoff data for the system, was modified to include an underdrain. However, the addition of an underdrain adds three new parameters (drain size, drain placement height, and drain spacing) that both influence the ECN and fundamentally change the design procedure. A sensitivity analysis was completed to quantify the impacts of different rainfall depths and distributions on this modified model. The RCN equations were then fit to the rainfall-runoff data to find the ECN value. ECN values for a wide range of pavement and underdrain configurations were summarized in figures that can be used as preliminary design aids for designers and regulators. These figures can be used to estimate the ECN value for a pavement design using only the basic pavement system, soil, and drain properties. A new design procedure was also proposed that uses these figures as a tool to estimate the required size and location of the underdrains for a pavement system to have a specified design ECN.

Surface Flow and Spread Calculations for the Preliminary Design of Porous Pavement Bike Lanes								JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING				142	2					04015046	10.1061/(ASCE)IR.1943-4774.0000964			FEB 2016	2016	This study investigated methods for predicting and managing surface water spread and depth on porous pavement bike lanes adjacent to impervious traffic lanes. Results are presented from a theoretical and experimental study into the hydraulic performance of porous pavement bike lanes. Analysis of the Saint-Venant equations was used to show that the distance required for water running onto a porous pavement to fully infiltrate into the pavement is linearly proportional to the width of the adjacent impervious traffic lanes and the rainfall intensity. It is inversely proportional to the sum of the rainfall intensity and pavement hydraulic conductivity. This result was validated by a series of large-scale laboratory experiments. A second model is presented for calculating the spacing of curb opening inlets along the side of a porous pavement that is relatively flat in the longitudinal direction. A graphical analysis of the runoff hydrograph that flows into the porous pavement was used to predict the peak discharge per unit length of pavement that must be handled by a curb opening inlet. This peak flow, combined with a local regulatory limit on the spread, leads to a simple algebraic expression for the required length of curb opening inlet per unit length of bike lane. Examples of how both these results can be used in preliminary design calculations are presented.

A multiscale approach to modeling formability of dual-phase steels								MODELLING AND SIMULATION IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING				24	2					025011	10.1088/0965-0393/24/2/025011			FEB 2016	2016	A multiscale modeling approach is used to predict how the formability of dual-phase (DP) steels depend on the properties of their constituent phases and microstructure. First, the flow behavior of the steels is predicted using microstructure-based finite element simulations of their 3D representative volume elements, wherein the two phases (ferrite and martensite) are discretely modeled using crystal plasticity constitutive models. These results are then used to calibrate homogenized constitutive models which are then used in large-scale finite element simulations to compute the forming limit diagrams (FLDs). The multiscale approach is validated by predicting the FLDs of two commercial DP steels and comparing the predictions with experimental measurements. Subsequently, the approach is used to compute flow behavior and FLDs of a series of 'virtual' DP steels, constructed by varying the microstructural parameters in the commercial DP steels. The results of these computations suggest that combining the ferrite from one of the two commercial steels with the martensite of the other and optimizing the phase volume fractions can yield 'virtual' steels with substantially improved properties. These include a material with an FLD0 (plane strain) that exceeds those of the commercial steels by 75% without a degradation in strength; and a material with a flow strength (0.2% offset) that exceeds those of the commercial steels by similar to 30% without degradation of formability.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0965-0393	1361-651X		WOS:000368861200011

Since this dysregulation could contribute to weight dynamics, this study aimed to compare autonomic regulation in children with obesity and normal-weight peers and to track autonomic status during weight reduction.MethodsSixty children with obesity and 27 age- and sex-matched normal-weight healthy participants were included. Heart rate variability (HRV) was assessed at baseline and during a mental stress test and a subsequent recovery period. Children with obesity were investigated both upon admission and discharge.ResultsUpon admission, no significant differences in HRV parameters were found for normal-weight participants and those with obesity. Inpatient treatment led to significant changes in HRV with increase in general variability (standard deviation of the normal-to-normal interval (SDNN), P<0.001) as well as of parasympathetic regulation (root mean square successive difference (RMSSD) and high frequency power (logHF), P<0.01). Children with obesity had sympathetic activation similar to normal-weight controls during mental stress with subsequent return to baseline values, and weight loss did not affect this profile.ConclusionsA weight reduction program induced a change in autonomic activity in children with obesity toward parasympathetic dominance but had no influence on autonomic nervous system reactivity during stress conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1930-7381	1930-739X		WOS:000369139500024	26704529

Mandeville against Luxury								POLITICAL THEORY				44	1			26	52		10.1177/0090591715584827			FEB 2016	2016	For three hundred years, Bernard Mandeville was considered the first great apologist for luxury and the unsavory dimensions of commercial society, a reputation that remains largely intact even as scholars reconsider the depth and influence of his thought. Here, I argue that Mandeville's attitude toward luxury and material excess is far more ambivalentindeed, highly criticalthan previously thought. As societies became wealthier and more literate, Mandeville saw both individuals and societies growing increasingly susceptible to discontentto grumbling, as the original title of The Fable of the Bees has it. This focus on grumbling is particularly worthy of close study because Mandeville's chief profession was medicine, and, more specifically, the treatment of hypochondria. Identifying the bourgeois lifestyle as the cause of hypochondria in both the body and the body politic led him to caution his patients against the very things with which his name is synonymous: luxury and excess.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0090-5917	1552-7476		WOS:000368799200003

A considerable amount of heat is generated by the battery cells owing to their internal resistance during charging and discharging, especially for peak vehicle loads. This study focuses on developing a smart controlled thermal management solution in which a vapor compression system is integrated. A lumped-parameter cylindrical battery thermal model is developed with a Kalman observer to estimate the transient changes in the temperatures of the battery surface, the battery core, and the cooling air flowing around the cells. For the first time, the optimal cooling air temperature of the battery is investigated using optimal control theory. A model predictive controller is then introduced to regulate the refrigerant compressor and to track the ideal cooling air temperature. In a case study, the power consumption of the thermal management system and the behavior of the internal temperature of the battery are investigated under an urban assault cycle. For various operation configurations and conditions, the numerical results demonstrate that the peak error of the core temperature of the battery can be tracked within 0.25 degrees C of the target value and the energy consumption of the cooling system can be reduced by up to 58%.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0954-4070	2041-2991		WOS:000368824300004

Multiphysics computational analysis of white-etch cracking failure mode in wind turbine gearbox bearings								PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART L-JOURNAL OF MATERIALS-DESIGN AND APPLICATIONS				230	1			43	63		10.1177/1464420714544803			FEB 2016	2016	Wind energy is currently one of the most promising and the fastest-growing installed alternative-energy production technologies. It is anticipated that by 2030, at least 20% of the US energy needs will be provided by this form of energy. The economics of wind energy require that wind turbines (convertors of wind energy into electrical energy) be able to operate for at least 20 years, with only regular maintenance. Unfortunately, many wind turbines require major repairs after only 3-5 years in service, mainly due to the failure of their gear boxes. It is this lack of gear box reliability which is currently compromising wind energy economics. In the present work, a multiphysics computational methodology has been developed and used to analyze the problem of white-etch cracking, one of the key processes responsible for the premature failure of gearbox roller bearings. The multiphysics methodology includes: (a) quantum-mechanical calculations of the hydrogen dissolution and the accompanying grain boundary embrittlement phenomena; (b) atomistic-level kinetic Monte Carlo analysis of hydrogen diffusion from the crack wake into the adjacent unfractured material; (c) cohesive zone type modeling of the intergranular fracture processes; and (d) a conventional displacement-based finite element analysis of the kinematic and structural response of the bearing under service loading conditions. The results obtained clearly revealed the operation of the white-etch cracking phenomena and their possible interaction with the conventional rolling-contact fatigue damage processes.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1464-4207	2041-3076		WOS:000368810400004

Ladner, David/0000-0002-9214-783X			Effect of bead milling on chemical and physical characteristics of activated carbons pulverized to superfine sizes								WATER RESEARCH				89				161	170		10.1016/j.watres.2015.11.041			FEB 1 2016	2016	Superfine powdered activated carbon (S-PAC) is an adsorbent material with particle size between roughly 0.1-1 gm. This is about an order of magnitude smaller than conventional powdered activated carbon (PAC), typically 10-50 pm. S-PAC has been shown to outperform PAC for adsorption of various drinking water contaminants. However, variation in S-PAC production methods and limited material characterization in prior studies lead to questions of how S-PAC characteristics deviate from that of its parent PAC. In this study, a wet mill filled with 03-0.5 mm yttrium-stabilized zirconium oxide grinding beads was used to produce S-PAC from seven commercially available activated carbons of various source materials, including two coal types, coconut shell, and wood. Particle sizes were varied by changing the milling time, keeping mill power, batch volume, and recirculation rate constant. As expected, mean particle size decreased with longer milling. A lignite coal-based carbon had the smallest mean particle diameter at 169 nm, while the wood-based carbon had the largest at 440 nm. The wood and coconut shell based carbons had the highest resistance to milling. Specific surface area and pore volume distributions were generally unchanged with increased milling time. Changes in the point of zero charge (pHpzc) and oxygen content of the milled carbons were found to correlate with an increasing specific external surface area. However, the isoelectric point (pHIEp), which measures only external surfaces, was unchanged with milling and also much lower in value than pHpzc. It is likely that the outer surface is easily oxidized while internal surfaces remain largely unchanged, which results in a lower average pH as measured by pHpzc. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Clusters corresponding to large metropolitan areas - including Miami, Atlanta, and Baltimore - had HIV prevalence rates higher (p<.001) than the regional rate. Regression analysis within the counties included in these clusters determined that race was a significant indicator for PLWH. These results provide a general picture of the distribution of PLWH in the southern United States at the county level and provide insights for identifying local geographic areas with a high number of PLWH, as well as subpopulations that may have an increased risk of infection.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0954-0121	1360-0451		WOS:000368608200019	26332197

Carbohydrate and nutrient composition of corn stover from three southeastern USA locations								BIOMASS & BIOENERGY				85				153	158		10.1016/j.biombioe.2015.11.031			FEB 2016	2016	Corn (Zea mays L.) stover has been identified as an important feedstock for bioenergy and bio-product production. Our objective was to quantify nutrient removal, carbohydrate composition, theoretical ethanol yield (TEY) for various stover fractions. In 2009, 2010, and 2011, whole-plant samples were collected from one field study in South Carolina (SC) and two in Alabama (AL). Soils at the SC site were classified as a Coxville/Rains-Goldboro-Lynchburg association, while those in AL were either Compass or Decatur. Plants were collected from two 1-m row segments, ears were removed and shelled. A portion of the remaining stalks were dried and ground to represent whole-plant stover. The remaining stalks were fractionated into stalk and leaf biomass from below the ear (bottom), stalk and leaf biomass from above the ear (top), cobs, and grain. A fifth sample representing "above-ear" biomass that might be collected mechanically was calculated using the weight ratios of the top and cob fractions. Carbohydrate and nutrient concentrations were estimated using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and TEY was calculated. The distribution of carbohydrates, nutrients, and TEY varied significantly among the corn stover fraction and research locations. This indicates that site-specific sampling and analysis should be used to optimize bioenergy and bio-product utilization of corn stover. However, at every location, the above-ear stover fractions were most desirable for cellulosic ethanol production. Furthermore, harvesting only above-ear stover fractions would reduce nutrient removal by 24-61% when compared to harvesting all stover biomass. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Triphasic waves (TWs), a subtype of GPDs, have been described in relation to metabolic encephalopathy and not felt to be associated with seizures. We sought to establish the consistency of use of this descriptive term and its association with seizures.Methods: 11 experts in continuous EEG monitoring scored 20 cEEG samples containing GPDs using Standardized Critical Care EEG Terminology. In the absence of patient information, the inter-rater agreement (IRA) for EEG descriptors including TWs was assessed along with raters' clinical EEG interpretation and compared with actual patient information.Results: The IRA for 'generalized' and 'periodic' was near-perfect (kappa = 0.81), but fair for 'triphasic' (kappa = 0.33). Patients with TWs were as likely to develop seizures as those without (25% vs 26%, N. S.) and surprisingly, patients with TWs were less likely to have toxic-metabolic encephalopathy than those without TWs (55% vs 79%, p < 0.01).Conclusions: While IRA for the terms 'generalized" and 'periodic" is high, it is only fair for TWs. EEG interpreted as TWs presents similar risk for seizures as GPDs without triphasic appearance. GPDs are commonly associated with metabolic encephalopathy, but 'triphasic' appearance is not predictive.Significance: Conventional association of 'triphasic waves' with specific clinical conditions may lead to inaccurate EEG interpretation.

Leaching potential of nano-scale titanium dioxide in fresh municipal solid waste								CHEMOSPHERE				144				1567	1572		10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.10.037			FEB 2016	2016	With the rapid development in nanotechnology in recent years, the number of commercially available products containing engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) has increased significantly. It is expected that large fractions of these ENMs will end up in landfills for final disposal. Despite the wide use of ENMs, little data is available on their fate within landfills. This study examined the leaching behavior of nanoscale titanium dioxide (nano-TiO2), one of the mostly used ENMs, in fresh municipal solid wastes (MSWs). Batch reactors containing municipal waste samples were spiked with a range of nano-TiO2 concentrations at different pH and ionic strength conditions. The Ti concentrations in leachate decreased rapidly and reached steady state after about 12-24 h. Results suggest that, for the environmental conditions considered, approximately 3-19% of the added nano-TiO(2)remained in leachate. Batch tests conducted with individual synthetically-prepared solid waste components also showed low leaching potential (5.2% for organic waste, 3.3% for glass, 1.7% for both textile and paper and 0.6% for metal), indicating that all components of MSW contributed to the retention of the nano-TiO2 mass within the solid matrix.

Perturbations in polar lipids, starvation survival and reproduction following exposure to unsaturated fatty acids or environmental toxicants in Daphnia magna								CHEMOSPHERE				144				2302	2311		10.1016/j.chemosphere.2015.11.015			FEB 2016	2016	Acclimating to toxicant stress is energy expensive. In laboratory toxicology tests dietary conditions are ideal, but not in natural environments where nutrient resources vary in quality and quantity. We compared the effects of additional lipid resources, docosahexaenoic acid (n-3; DHA) or linoleic acid (n-6; LA), or the effects of the toxicants, atrazine or triclosan on post-treatment starvation survival, reproduction, and lipid profiles. Chemical exposure prior to starvation had chemical-specific effects as DHA showed moderately beneficial effects on starvation survival and all of the other chemicals showed adverse effects on either survival or reproduction. Surprisingly, pre-exposure to triclosan inhibits adult maturation and in turn completely blocks reproduction during the starvation phase. The two HR96 activators tested, atrazine and LA adversely reduce post-reproduction survival 70% during starvation and in turn show poor fecundity. DHA and LA show distinctly different lipid profiles as DHA primarily increases the percentage of large (>37 carbon) phosphatidylcholine (PC) species and LA primarily increases the percentage of smaller (<37 carbon) PC species. The toxicants atrazine and triclosan moderately perturb a large number of different phospholipids including several phosphatidylethanolamine species. Some of these polar lipid species may be biomarkers for diets rich in specific fatty acids or toxicant classes. Overall our data demonstrates that toxicants can perturb lipid utilization and storage in daphnids in a chemical specific manner, and different chemicals can produce distinct polar lipid profiles. In summary, biological effects caused by fatty acids and toxicants are associated with changes in the production and use of lipids. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Four new axially disubstituted, non-aggregated silicon phthalocyanines (SiPcs), containing azide or alkyne functional groups have been synthesized and characterized. The method of synthesis is based on the reaction of silicon phthalocyanine dichloride with variable length poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains in the presence of NaH. All synthesized dyes are highly soluble in alcohols, THF, CH2 Cl-2, acetone, DMF and other common polar organic solvents, with the PEGylated silicon phthalocyanines (SiPcs) also being soluble in water. Photophysical and electrochemical properties of the dyes have been investigated. The presence of alkyne or azide groups in the phthalocyanine dyes, coupled with their high aqueous solubility, make these compounds useful as building blocks in copper catalyzed Huigsen azide-alkyne cycloaddition reactions (i.e. click chemistry).

Then, Monte Carlo method with nucleation in every MC step is used for the simulation of the grain growth in FSW. In addition, the process of dynamic recrystallization which results in the nucleation of new grains has been modeled. The model is validated by comparison of both experiments and numerical results from the literature. The width of the stirring zone has been estimated by monitoring the movements of the traced material particles and by identifying the region containing dynamically recrystallized fine grains. The inner border of the heat-affected zone has been determined by monitoring the material flow, while the outer border has been identified by monitoring the average grain size as a function of the lateral distance from the weld. The effect of two FSW process parameters, tool rotational speed and tool shoulder diameter, is investigated. An increase in either of these two parameters has been found to increase the overall grain size as well as the width of the welding zones.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000367647100022

The cost terms of the objective function include risk cost of load not supplied of the customers, cost of energy loss of the system, investment costs for purchasing the DGs and capacitor banks, and maintenance costs of the installed DGs and capacitor banks. Herein, the customers' load types including residential, commercial, and industrial are modeled in the planning problem and load model-based power flow is applied instead of the conventional power flow. In addition, the failure rate of the distribution feeder is modeled respect with magnitude of the current flowing through the feeder applying several mathematical functions such as linear, power, exponential, and logarithmic. Moreover, in order to achieve realistic results, economic factors such as inflation and interest rates and technical factors including yearly load growth, hourly variations of the load, and daily variations of the load are taken into consideration in the planning problem.

The biocrude was produced using hydrothermal liquefaction of microalgae (Scenedesmus-dominated polyculture) grown in municipal wastewater. Four metal catalysts (platinum, ruthenium, nickel and cobalt) were tested at 350 degrees C under the presence of high pressure hydrogen, and all the experiments were conducted at a weight hourly space velocity of 0.51 g/g(cat).h. Hydrotreating with all the catalysts increased higher heating value, while reducing viscosity and total acid number (TAN) of the biocrude. For example, biocrude upgraded using platinum catalyst increased the heating value from 45.9 to 47.0 MJ/Icg and reduced the TAN from 11.56 to 0.1 mg KOH/g. In addition, the liquid produced was colorless. Furthermore, the use of ruthenium and platinum catalysts greatly enhanced the yield of hexadecane and octadecane in the hydrogen-treated liquids whereas heptadecane was less favored. Overall, hydrogen treatment of biocrude was effective in improving the quality of biocrude produced from algae grown in wastewater. The BET surface area was reduced for all the spent catalysts. An SEM-EDS analysis revealed that some liquid products and sulfur were deposited in the spent catalysts. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

These biological materials, although formed from simple biopolymer and biomineral constituents, take on many intricate and effective designs. The specific environmental conditions that shape all marine organisms have helped modify these materials into their current forms: complete hydration, and variation in hydrostatic pressure, temperature, salinity, as well as motion from currents and swells. These conditions vary throughout the ocean, being more consistent in the pelagic and deep benthic zones while experiencing more variability in the nearshore and shallows (e.g. intertidal zones, shallow bays and lagoons, salt marshes and mangrove forests). Of note, many marine organisms are capable of migrating between these zones. In this review, the basic building blocks of these structural biological materials and a variety of protective strategies in marine organisms are discussed with a focus on their structure and mechanical properties. Finally, the bioinspired potential of these biological materials is discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									4	0	0	1	0	4			0928-4931	1873-0191		WOS:000367107400131	26652472

Participants classified 95 real-world causal factors (five causal factors for each of the 19 HFACS categories) extracted from a variety of industrial accidents. Inter-rater reliability of the HFACS coding process was evaluated by comparing performance across participants immediately following training and intra-rater reliability was evaluated by having the same participants repeat the coding process following a two-week delay.Results: Krippendorffs Alpha was used to evaluate the reliability of the coding process across the various HFACS levels and categories. Results revealed the HFACS taxonomy to be reliable in terms of inter- and intra-rater reliability, with the latter producing slightly higher Alpha values.Conclusion: Results support the inter- and intra-rater reliability of the HFACS framework but also reveal additional opportunities for improving HFACS training and implementation.

J	Chowdhury, M. Nasimul; Testik, Firat Y.; Hornack, Mathew C.; Khan, Abdul A.								Free fall of water drops in laboratory rainfall simulations								ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH				168				158	168		10.1016/j.atmosres.2015.08.024			FEB 1 2016	2016	Motivated by various hydrological and meteorological applications, this paper investigates the free fall of water drops to provide guidance in laboratory simulations of natural rainfall and to elucidate drop morphodynamics. Drop fall velocity and shape parameters such as axis ratio (ratio of the maximum vertical and horizontal chords of the drop), chord ratio [ratio of the two orthogonal chords where one chord (ci) is the longest chord in the drop and the other one (c(s)) is the longest chord that is orthogonal to c(l), canting angle (angle between the longest chord of the drop and the horizontal axis), and relative fluctuation of chords (difference between vertical and horizontal chord fluctuations) were investigated for three selected water drop sizes (2.6, 3.7, and 5.1 mm spherical volume equivalent diameter) using high speed imaging. Based upon experimental observations, three distinct fall zones were identified: Zone I, in which source-induced oscillations and shape adjustment take place; Zone II, in which equilibrium-shaped drops accelerate to achieve terminal velocity; and Zone III, in which equilibrium-shaped drops fall at terminal velocity. Our results revealed that the fall distance values of approximately 6 m and 12 m can be used as conservative reference values for rainfall experiments with oscillation-free fall of drops (i.e. end of Zone land onset of Zone II) and with equilibrium-shaped drops falling at terminal velocities (i.e. end of Zone II and onset of Zone III), respectively, for the entire raindrop size spectrum in natural rainfall. These required fall distance values are smaller than the distances discussed in the literature. Methodology and results presented here will facilitate optimum experimental laboratory simulations of natural rainfall. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Ngaosuwan, Kanokwan; Goodwin, James G., Jr.; Prasertdham, Piyasan								A green sulfonated carbon-based catalyst derived from coffee residue for esterification								RENEWABLE ENERGY				86				262	269		10.1016/j.renene.2015.08.010			FEB 2016	2016	A green sulfonated carbon-based catalyst was successfully synthesized through sulfonation of incompletely carbonized coffee residue (SCAC catalyst). The sulfonation temperature was investigated and the catalytic activity was tested via esterification of caprylic acid. SCAC-200, the highest caprylic acid conversion at 4 h (71.5%) and initial TOF based on SO3H acid sites, was synthesized under a carbonization temperature of 600 degrees C for 4 h and sulfonation temperature of 200 degrees C for 18 h. Sulfonation temperature plays a dominant role in determining the SO3H site density of SCAC catalysts because side reactions (condensation/oxidation/dehydrogenation) take place at high sulfonation temperature as indicated by oxygen-to-carbon surface ratio. The activities of the SCAC catalysts were also substantially greater than that of Amberlyst-15. A high catalytic activity and catalyst stability for esterification of HCp were achieved in the SCAC catalysts with high surface area and by balancing strong (SO3H) and weak (carboxylic and phenolic) acid site densities. Additionally, this catalyst could be regenerated to obtain essentially its initial catalytic activity by MeOH washing. Therefore, the sulfonated coffee residue derived catalyst is promising, economic eco-friendly and potentially substituted for homogeneous H2SO4 catalyst for esterification in industries in the near future.

J	Gwak, So-Jung; Yun, Yeomin; Yoon, Do Heum; Kim, Keung Nyun; Ha, Yoon								Therapeutic Use of 3 beta-[N-(N ',N '-Dimethylaminoethane) Carbamoyl] Cholesterol-Modified PLGA Nanospheres as Gene Delivery Vehicles for Spinal Cord Injury								PLOS ONE				11	1					e0147389	10.1371/journal.pone.0147389			JAN 29 2016	2016	Gene delivery holds therapeutic promise for the treatment of neurological diseases and spinal cord injury. Although several studies have investigated the use of non-viral vectors, such as polyethylenimine (PEI), their clinical value is limited by their cytotoxicity. Recently, biodegradable poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanospheres have been explored as non-viral vectors. Here, we show that modification of PLGA nanospheres with 3 beta-[N-(N',N'-dimethylaminoethane) carbamoyl] cholesterol (DC-Chol) enhances gene transfection efficiency. PLGA/DC-Chol nanospheres encapsulating DNA were prepared using a double emulsion-solvent evaporation method. PLGA/DC-Chol nanospheres were less cytotoxic than PEI both in vitro and in vivo. DC-Chol modification improved the uptake of nanospheres, thereby increasing their transfection efficiency in mouse neural stem cells in vitro and rat spinal cord in vivo. Also, transgene expression induced by PLGA nanospheres was higher and longer-lasting than that induced by PEI. In a rat model of spinal cord injury, PLGA/DC-Chol nanospheres loaded with vascular endothelial growth factor gene increased angiogenesis at the injury site, improved tissue regeneration, and resulted in better recovery of locomotor function. These results suggest that DC-Chol-modified PLGA nanospheres could serve as therapeutic gene delivery vehicles for spinal cord injury.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1932-6203			WOS:000369528600031	26824765

Herein, we report foundational evidence that catalysts bearing redox-active moieties may be used to synthesize high molecular weight polyethylene with tailored microstructure. The ability to modulate branching density and identity is facilitated by ligand-based redox chemistry, and is realized via the addition of chemical reductants into the polymerization reactor. Detailed GPC and NMR analyses demonstrate that branching density may be altered by up to similar to 30% as a function of in situ added reductant.									4	0	0	1	0	4			0002-7863			WOS:000369044400016	26722675	
J	Adler, Peter H.; Kudelova, Tatiana; Kudela, Matus; Seitz, Gunther; Ignjatovic-Cupina, Aleksandra								Cryptic Biodiversity and the Origins of Pest Status Revealed in the Macrogenome of Simulium colombaschense (Diptera: Simuliidae), History's Most Destructive Black Fly								PLOS ONE				11	1					e0147673	10.1371/journal.pone.0147673			JAN 25 2016	2016	The European black fly Simulium (Simulium) colombaschense (Scopoli), once responsible for as many as 22,000 livestock deaths per year, is chromosomally mapped, permitting its evolutionary relationships and pest drivers to be inferred. The species is 12 fixed inversions removed from the standard sequence of the subgenus Simulium. Three of these fixed inversions, 38 autosomal polymorphisms, and a complex set of 12 X and 6 Y chromosomes in 29 zygotic combinations uniquely characterize S. colombaschense and reveal 5 cytoforms: 'A' in the Danube watershed, 'B' in Italy's Adige River, 'C' in the Aliakmonas River of Greece, 'D' in the Aoos drainage in Greece, and 'E' in the Bela River of Slovakia. 'C' and 'D' are reproductively isolated from one another, and 'B' is considered a cytotype of 'A,' the probable name bearer of colombaschense. The species status of 'E' cannot be determined without additional collections. Three derived polytene sequences, based on outgroup comparisons, place S. colombaschense in a clade of species composed of the S. jenningsi, S. malyschevi, and S. reptans species groups. Only cytoforms 'A' and 'B' are pests. Within the Simuliidae, pest status is reached through one of two principal pathways, both of which promote the production of large populations of blood-seeking flies: (1) colonization of the world's largest rivers (habitat specialization) or (2) colonization of multiple habitat types (habitat generalization). Evolutionary acquisition of the ability to colonize large rivers by an ancestor of the S. jenningsi-malyschevi-reptans clade set the scene for the pest status of S. colombaschense and other big-river members of the clade. In an ironic twist, the macrogenome of S. colombaschense reveals that the name associated with history's worst simuliid pest represents a complex of species, two or more of which are nonpests potentially vulnerable to loss of their limited habitat.									5	0	0	5	0	5			1932-6203			WOS:000369527800174	26808274

The stress-induced birefringence was estimated to be 2.4 x 10(-4) at the wavelength of 1550 nm. By adding the desired numbers of stressed rods, an in-fiber quarter waveplate was fabricated with a insertion loss of 0.19 dB. The stress-induced birefringence was further explored to fabricate in-fiber polarizers based on the polarization-dependent long-period fiber grating (LPFG) structure. A polarization extinction ratio of more than 20 dB was observed at the resonant wavelength of 1523.9 nm. The in-fiber polarization devices may be useful in optical communications and fiber optic sensing applications.

It was found that europium ions could be readily incorporated into a number of crystals using a variety of simple glass-based feedstocks. The hydrothermal growth reactions were performed at nearly 600 degrees C in 1-5 M NaOH mineralizer fluids, and this was found to be a versatile route to both europium ion oxidation states with Eu acting as either a fundamental structural building block or a dopant ion. Several new single crystals were identified including two new apatites as well as a new europium borosilicate. The apatites crystallize in space group P6(3)/m with a = 9.4619(13) angstrom and c = 7.0054(14) angstrom for Eu-10(SiO4)(6)O-2, and a = 9.4413(13) A and c = 6.9087(14) angstrom for NaEu9(SiO4)(6)O-2. The new borosilicate, Eu2SiB2O8, crystallizes in space group Pbcn with a = 13.310(3) angstrom, b = 4.4247(9) angstrom and c = 9.2394(18) angstrom. The investigation of Eu-doped borosilicates demonstrated the strong blue emission generated from 370 nm excitation that was expected for the Eu2+ doped materials, as well as the less intense orange-red emission expected for the Eu3+ dopants. The hydrothermal reactions naturally facilitated a degree of europium reduction in Eu:Ba3Si2B6O16. It was found that the oxidation states of europium in the final product could be further controlled by using hydrazine as a reducing reagent.

Nanoparticles with active targeting capabilities attempt to further enhance specific delivery of drugs to the tumors via interaction with overexpressed cellular receptors. Consequently, it is widely accepted that drug delivery using actively targeted nanoparticles maximizes the therapeutic benefit and minimizes the off-target effects. However, the process of nanoparticle mediated active targeting initially relies on their passive accumulation in tumors. In this article, it is demonstrated that these two tumor-targeted drug delivery mechanisms are interrelated and dosage dependent. It is reported that at lower doses, actively targeted nanoparticles have distinctly higher efficacy in tumor inhibition than their passively targeted counterparts. However, the enhanced permeability and retention effect of the tumor tissue becomes the dominant factor influencing the efficacy of both passively and actively targeted nanoparticles when they are administered at higher doses. Importantly, it is demonstrated that dosage is a pivotal parameter that needs to be taken into account in the assessment of nanoparticle mediated targeted drug delivery.									4	0	0	2	0	4			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000368707800008	26619362

Two processing sequences were used for preparing PE/TPS/ZSM5 composites at a weight ratio of PE to TPS of 70:30 and ZSM5 concentrations of 1-5 wt%: (i) melt compounding of PE with ZSM5 prior to melt blending with TPS (SI); and (ii) TPS was compounded with ZSM5 prior to blending with PE (SID. Distributive mixing and mechanical properties of PE/TPS blend were greatly enhanced when ZSM5 was incorporated via SII. These were caused by both the higher affinity between PE and ZSM5, compared to that of TPS and ZSM5, and the reduction of TPS viscosity after compounding with ZSM5, leading to migration of ZSM5 from TPS dispersed phase toward PE matrix and increase in breakup of TPS droplets during SII sequence.

In this study, we have investigated the photosensitization, optical, and surface properties of pSi as a function of time in aqueous systems. Samples were prepared via an anodic electrochemical etching procedure, resulting in pSi particles with diameters of ca. 500 nm, composed of a porous network of Si nanocrystallites of 2-4 nm. Initially, pSi particles generated significant amounts of O-1(2), yet they rapidly lost much of this ability due to the formation of an oxide layer on the surface, as determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, which likely prevented further photosensitization events. Addition of natural organic matter (NOM) did not significantly impact pSis photosensitization abilities. The pSi lacked any intrinsic bactericidal properties on Escherichia coli and did not produce enough O-1(2) to considerably affect populations of a model virus, PR772, highlighting its relatively benign nature toward microbial communities. Results from this study suggest that the photoactivity of pSi is unlikely to persist in aqueous systems and that it may instead behave more similarly to silica particles from an environmental perspective.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000368563400026	26741883	
J	Li, Zhengqi; Afshinnia, Kaveh; Rangaraju, Prasada Rao								Effect of alkali content of cement on properties of high performance cementitious mortar								CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS				102				631	639		10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2015.10.110			JAN 15 2016	2016	The use of very low water-to-binder ratio (w/b) in high-performance cementitious mixtures (HPCM) such as ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) is gaining popularity. Typically these mixtures consist of Portland cement, pozzolans, water, aggregate, chemical admixtures and steel fiber. The properties of such mixtures including workability, strength, dimensional stability and durability are sensitive to the quality and the proportions of the materials used. In particular, due to high cementitious materials content and low w/b ratio of these mixtures, the alkali content of Portland cement can have a significant effect on the fresh and hardened properties. However, there is limited information available in the literature on the influence of cement alkalinity on the properties of these mixtures. In order to have a closer examination of the influence of alkali content of cement on the properties of such mixtures, a series of Portland cement mortars having a w/c ratio of 0.20 and a range of cement alkali contents were evaluated in this study. The workability, setting time, compressive strength, drying shrinkage, rapid chloride ion penetration, volume of permeable voids and alkali-silica reaction potential of HPCM using reactive aggregate were studied as a function of the alkali content of cement ranging from 0.49% to 0.88% Na2Oeq. The test results showed that when the alkali content of cement was higher than 0.70%, the workability of HPCMs decreased significantly as the alkali content increased. An increase in the alkali content of cement delayed the time of final setting, reduced the compressive strength, and increased the rapid chloride ion permeability, drying shrinkage and volume of permeable voids of HPCM. As the alkali content of cement increased, rapid and significant expansion due to ASR was observed in HPCM, along with significant loss in flexural strength of test specimens, even though the w/c was maintained at 0.20. Identical set of tests were conducted on parallel HPCM specimens containing Class F fly ash as a cement replacement material, and significant differences in results were observed when compared with pure Portland cement mixtures.

Responses of two genetically superior loblolly pine clonal ideotypes to a severe ice storm								FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT				360				213	220		10.1016/j.foreco.2015.10.044			JAN 15 2016	2016	An increase in the frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events, such as major ice storms, can have severe impacts on southern forests. We investigated the damage inflicted by a severe ice storm that occurred in February 2014 on two loblolly pine (Pins taeda L.) ideotypes in Cross, South Carolina located in the southeastern coastal plain. The "narrow crown" ideotype allocates more resources to stem growth while the "broad crown" ideotype allocates more of its resources to leaf area. We sampled each clone in August of 2014 and assessed damage based on four mutually exclusive damage categories: crown damage (visual estimation of percent damage); bent bole (bending shape and angle); snapped bole (distance from ground to snapped height); and uprooted. Damage category was statistically different between clones (chi(2) = 120.36; p = 0.001); 67% of the individuals of the narrow crown ideotype suffered crown damage compared to 94% of the broad crown ideotype; 27% of the individuals of narrow crown ideotype suffered immediate mortality after the bole snapped, compared to only 3% for the broad crown. Of the individuals that incurred crown damage, the degree of damage sustained was statistically different by clonal type (F = 8.73; p < 0.01). The broad crown ideotype incurred greater crown damage than the narrow crown (38.0 +/- 1.34 and 31.8 +/- 1.6, respectively). Damage that resulted in a bent bole was minimal, with 4% for the narrow crown ideotype and 3% for the broad crown. The observed clonal differences in response to damage that incurred from an extreme ice storm may be attributed to differences in morphology and carbon allocation strategies between the two ideotypes. These differences are important to carbon sequestration projects and ideotype development in regions that are prone to extreme glazing events. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Two phases of PANI-DBSA with different properties, such as a shell-wrapping carbon nanotube and separate neat PANI-DBSA domains, are revealed for the first time in the nanocomposites with a high or medium PANI-DBSA content. In the nanocomposites with lower PANI-DBSA contents (<40 wt %), only a core-shell morphology with similar to 3 nm or lower thickness PANI shell on the nanotubes is observed. Under this condition, the degree of crystallinity of the PANI-DBSA shell increases almost 2-fold, and thermal stability of the nanocomposite grows sharply. As compared with the neat PANI-DBSA, this special PANI shell phase has more perfect molecular structure and is characterized by a reduced amount of DBSA. It is found that the latter is caused by a competition between the processes of doping of the formed PANI in the shell by the protonic acid and p-doping caused by the MWCNT surface.

BDPA-Doped Polystyrene Beads as Polarization Agents for DNP-NMR								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B				120	1			18	24		10.1021/acs.jpcb.5b08741			JAN 14 2016	2016	The aromatic free radical BDPA (alpha,gamma-bisdiphenylene-beta-phenylallyl), which has been widely used as a polarizing agent for Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) of hydrophobic analytes, has been incorporated into nanometer-scale polystyrene latex beads. We have shown that the resulting BDPA-doped beads can be used to hyperpolarize C-13 and Li-7 nuclei in aqueous environments, without the need for a glassing cosolvent. DNP enhancement factors of between 20 and 100 were achieved with overall BDPA concentrations of 2 mM or less. These Highly-Effective Polymer/Radical Beads (HYPR-beads) have potential use as an inexpensive polarizing agent for water-soluble analytes, and also have applications as model nanoparticles in DNP studies.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1520-6106			WOS:000368561900003	26717243

Here, we use discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) simulations and high-throughput dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments to study the anti-aggregation effects of two polyphenols, curcumin and resveratrol, on the aggregation of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP or amylin). Our DMD simulations suggest that the aggregation inhibition is caused by stabilization of small molecular weight IAPP off-pathway oligomers by the polyphenols. Our analysis indicates that IAPP-polyphenol hydrogen bonds and pi-pi stacking combined with hydrophobic interactions are responsible for the stabilization of oligomers. The presence of small oligomers is confirmed with DLS measurements in which nanometer-sized oligomers are found to be stable for up to 7.5 hours, the time frame within which IAPP aggregates in the absence of polyphenols. Our study offers a general anti-aggregation mechanism for polyphenols, and further provides a computational framework for the future design of anti-amyloid aggregation therapeutics.									4	0	0	3	0	4			2045-2322			WOS:000368149200002	26763863

Using semiclassical Boltzmann dynamics in the relaxation time approximation for a lattice model of time-reversal (TR) symmetry broken WSMs, we compute both magnetic field dependent and anomalous contributions to the Nernst coefficient. In addition to the magnetic field dependent Nernst response, which is present in both Dirac and Weyl semimetals, we show that, contrary to previous reports, the TR-broken WSM also has an anomalous Nernst response due to a nonvanishing Berry curvature. We also compute the thermal conductivities of a WSM in the Nernst (del T perpendicular to B) and the longitudinal (del T parallel to B) setup and confirm from our lattice model that in the parallel setup, the Wiedemann-Franz law is violated between the longitudinal thermal and electrical conductivities due to the chiral anomaly.									3	0	0	1	0	3			1098-0121	1550-235X		WOS:000368295000003

J	Peng, Yunhui; Norris, Joy; Schwartz, Charles; Alexov, Emil								Revealing the Effects of Missense Mutations Causing Snyder-Robinson Syndrome on the Stability and Dimerization of Spermine Synthase.								International journal of molecular sciences				17	1						10.3390/ijms17010077			2016 Jan 08	2016	Missense mutations in spermine synthase (SpmSyn) protein have been shown to cause the Snyder-Robinson syndrome (SRS). Depending on the location within the structure of SpmSyn and type of amino acid substitution, different mechanisms resulting in SRS were proposed. Here we focus on naturally occurring amino acid substitutions causing SRS, which are situated away from the active center of SpmSyn and thus are not directly involved in the catalysis. Two of the mutations, M35R and P112L, are reported for the first time in this study. It is demonstrated, both experimentally and computationally, that for such mutations the major effect resulting in dysfunctional SpmSyn is the destabilization of the protein. In vitro experiments indicated either no presence or very little amount of the mutant SpmSyn in patient cells. In silico modeling predicted that all studied mutations in this work destabilize SpmSyn and some of them abolish homo-dimer formation. Since dimerization and structural stability are equally important for the wild type function of SpmSyn, it is proposed that the SRS caused by mutations occurring in the N-domain of SpmSyn is a result of dysfunctional mutant proteins being partially unfolded and degraded by the proteomic machinery of the cell or being unable to form a homo-dimer.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1422-0067		MEDLINE:26761001	26761001

Since no cure is currently available for T2D, it is of great benefit to devise new anti aggregation molecules, which protect beta-cells against hIAPP aggregation-induced toxicity. Engineered nanoparticles have been recently exploited as anti-aggregation nanomedicines. In this work, we studied graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets for their potential for hIAPP aggregation inhibition by combining computational modeling, biophysical characterization and cell toxicity measurements. Using discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) simulations and in vitro studies, we showed that GO exhibited an inhibitory effect on hIAPP aggregation. DMD simulations indicated that the strong binding of hIAPP to GO nanosheets was driven by hydrogen bonding and aromatic stacking and that the strong peptide-GO binding efficiently inhibited hIAPP self-association and aggregation on the nanosheet surface. Secondary structural changes of hIAPP upon GO binding derived from DMD simulations were consistent with circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy measurements. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images confirmed the reduction of hIAPP aggregation in the presence of GO. Furthermore, we carried out a cell toxicity assay and found that these nanosheets protected insulin-secreting NIT-1 pancreatic beta-cells against hIAPP-induced toxicity. Our multidisciplinary study suggests that GO nanosheets have the potential to be utilized as an anti-aggregation nanomedicine itself in addition to a biosensor or delivery vehicle for the mitigation of T2D progression.									3	0	0	1	0	3			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000368755500009	26625841	
J	Liu, Chao; Croue, Jean-Philippe								Formation of Bromate and Halogenated Disinfection Byproducts during Chlorination of Bromide-Containing Waters in the Presence of Dissolved Organic Matter and CuO								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				50	1			135	144		10.1021/acs.est.5b03266			JAN 5 2016	2016	Previous studies showed that significant bromate (BrO3-) can be formed via the CuO-catalyzed disproportiona-tion of hypobromous acid (HOBO pathway. In this study, the influence of CuO on the formation of BrO3- and halogenated disinfection byproducts (DBPs) (e.g., trihalomethanes, THMs and haloacetic acids, HAAs) during chlorination of six dissolved organic matter (DOM) isolates was investigated. Only in the presence of slow reacting DOM (from treated Colorado River water, i.e., CRW-BF-HPO), significant BrO3- formation is observed, which competes with bromination of DOM (i.e., THM and HAA formation). Reactions between HOBr and 12 model compounds in the presence of CuO indicates that CuO-catalyzed HOBr disproportionation is completely inhibited by fast reacting phenols, while it predominates in the presence of practically unreactive compounds (acetone, butanol, propionic, and butyric acids). In the presence of slow reacting di- and tricarboxylic acids (oxalic, malonic, succinic, and citric acids), BrO3- formation varies, depending on its competition with bromoform and dibromoacetic acid formation (i.e., brornination pathway). The latter pathway can be enhanced by CuO due to the activation of HOBr. Therefore, increasing CuO dose (0-0.2 g L-1) in a reaction system containing chlorine, bromide, and CRW-BF-HPO enhances the formation of BrO3-, total THMs and HAAs. Factors including pH and initial reactant concentrations influence the DBP formation. These novel findings have implications for elevated DBP formation during transportation of chlorinated waters in copper-containing distribution systems.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000367866300016	26630351	
J	Haddadi, Farid; Abu-Farha, Fadi					Haddadi, Farid/0000-0003-2186-3406			The effect of interface reaction on vibration evolution and performance of aluminium to steel high power ultrasonic spot joints								MATERIALS & DESIGN				89				50	57		10.1016/j.matdes.2015.09.121			JAN 5 2016	2016	High power ultrasonic spot welding is an energy efficient technique with great potentials for joining dissimilar metals in automotive applications. Efforts were carried out to find out the effect of interface reaction on ultrasonic vibration behaviour during the welding process. Rapid coarse scale drift was observed as the tips settled on the work-piece when the power was initially applied. A small periodic displacement (0.1 mu m) took place at the earliest stage of welding which built up to 2.5 mu m in a short time. It gradually approached a steady state of similar to 4-6.5 mu m for the majority of the weld, adopting a bimodal amplitude when the peak height alternated every second cycle. Finally, the vibration rapidly decayed when the power was turned off. The vibration amplitude was measured as the highest point during joining bare steel to aluminium and decreased with zinc coated steels as a result of the coating hardness behaviour. This took place when zinc was melting at the interface due to Al-Zn eutectic reaction, thus causing the vibration to be in sliding condition with low power delivery. The sliding condition accompanied by less deformation was found to delay heat generation and therefore, dynamic recrystallization. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Using linear prediction techniques for stationary time series, a new test statistic that assesses a null hypothesis of equal means is proposed and investigated. Our test statistic mimics the classical F-type ratio form used with independent data, but substitutes estimated prediction residuals in for the errors. This simple tactic departs from past studies that adjust the quadratic forms in the numerator and denominator in the F ratio for autocorrelation. One of the advantages is that our statistic retains the classical null hypothesis F distribution (now as a limit) with the customary degrees of freedom. The statistic is shown to perform well in simulations. Asymptotic proofs are given in the case of autoregressive random errors; a sports application is supplied.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0003-1305	1537-2731		WOS:000373801000008

To determine the effects of these requirements in the wake of the 2010 Gulf Coast oil spill, we estimate willingness to pay (WTP) for various credence characteristics (geographic origin and production process) and physical attributes using a Becker DeGroot Marschak experimental auction. Although the results are obtained from a small convenience sample, and hence cannot be generalized, we find that participants are willing to pay premiums of $0.90-$1.23 per half-pound for domestic shrimp (regardless of production method) and $0.60-$1.03 per half-pound for wild-caught shrimp. We also find evidence that Gulf Coast shrimp are stigmatized; controlling for other characteristics, participants are willing to pay $1.03-$1.34 less per half-pound for Gulf Coast shrimp. Overall, credence attributes influence WTP more than physical attributes.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1365-7305	1551-8663		WOS:000371183600003

We present a multiple objective, integrated network optimisation model for making strategic decisions in the supply distribution and network restoration phases of humanitarian logistics operations. Our model provides an equity-based solution for constrained capacity, budget and resource problems in post-disaster logistics management. We conduct designed experiments for this NP-hard problem to analyse important aspects of the integrated problem for both small- and large-sized networks: full vs. partial restoration and pooled vs. separate budgeting approach. Finally, we apply the model to a Hazus-generated regional case study based on an earthquake scenario and generate efficient Pareto frontiers to understand the trade-off between the objectives of interest.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0020-7543	1366-588X		WOS:000368039100004

One study shows that when consumers do not know a product's original size and price, attitudes are more favorable toward a bonus pack than an economically equivalent product enlargement. This difference disappears when consumers know the original product size and price. A second study shows that, less intuitively, a product enlargement associated with a small (but not a large) price increase is evaluated as positively as a comparable bonus pack. The result for a small price increase and corroborating evidence support an account in which the product enlargement's economic inferiority is offset by consumer's use of the quantity discount heuristic. Implications for product manufacturers and consumer researchers are discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1069-6679	1944-7175		WOS:000366365600004

The new fully aromatic highly fluorinated poly(azomethine ether)s (PAMEs) were prepared by polycondensation of core-fluorinated azomethine-containing compounds. The structure of the monomers and polymers were confirmed by FTIR, H-1, C-13, and F-19 NMR spectroscopic analysis. The influence of synthesis condition on the properties of PAME compounds was investigated. Application of polarization microscopy with a temperature control thermal stage revealed thermotropic liquid crystalline (LC) behavior in the synthesized materials. Transition temperatures and a range of the existence of the LC phase were studied by a combination of the optical microscopy and DSC analysis. According to the TGA analysis, all the synthesized PAMEs show high thermal stability and thus offer a wide range of thermal processibility (up to 410-477 degrees C), which makes them prospective materials for many modern applications.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1385-772X	1568-5551		WOS:000365615500001

In addition, there remains a need to examine the process through which leadership and work-family conflict influence well-being outcomes. Using a sample of 312 workers, a mediated process model grounded in social exchange theory is tested wherein the authors seek to explain how leaders shape employee perceptions, which, in turn, impact organizational fulfillment of expectations (i.e., psychological contract breach), work-family conflict, and well-being. A fully latent structural equation model was used to test study hypotheses, all of which were supported. Building on existing theory, findings suggest that the supervisor plays a critical role as a frontline representative for the organization and that work-family conflict is reduced and well-being enhanced through a process of social exchange between the supervisor and worker.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0022-3980	1940-1019		WOS:000365576800009	25802949

The novelty of science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics (STEAM) instruction in K-12 classrooms means few cases of STEAM teaching are documented in depth.Design/methodology/approach - As part of a larger multi-year study researching STEAM teaching practices in 14 middle school classrooms in the southeastern USA, the article first summarizes prior research findings and then presents ideas for higher education and K-12 researchers to consider when incorporating STEAM teaching in pre-service education, professional development and in classrooms. Then, the authors use a second-order narrative approach to describe three cases of teachers enacting STEAM practices in classrooms.Findings - Drawing on the notion of " remixing" education in the context of STEAM, the authors show how each teacher alters existing practices, instead of offering entirely new instruction, as they implement STEAM teaching.Originality/value - With few cases of STEAM teaching detailed in the depth, this paper advances the understanding of STEAM teaching practices in K-12 classrooms.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1074-8121	2054-1708		WOS:000394391500002

Many techniques exist for both topology optimization and optimal placement of functionally gradient material within a single object, but combining the two is challenging. In addition, gradient materials allow customization of individual regions of a single part in order to achieve conflicting objectives or constraints. This paper shows a technique for concurrent topology and material gradient optimization within a single part while considering two conflicting objectives. The algorithm is applied to a standard topology optimization problem. The resulting gradient material designs have regions with distinct functionality and the material in these regions is chosen based on the regions function. In addition, a comparison of the gradient material design and a corresponding homogenous material design shows a significant improvement in the objective value for the gradient material design.

ASME					PRESSURIZED ORIGAMI STRUCTURE FOR PROGRAMMABLE NEGATIVE AND QUASI-ZERO STIFFNESS								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, 2016, VOL 5B										V05BT07A007				2016	2016	This research investigates the nonlinear pressure-induced stiffness characteristics of an origami structure associated to its large amplitude folding. Such structure consists of origami tubes that are formed by stacking and connecting Miura-Ori sheets along their crease lines, so that one can apply pressure to achieve autonomous folding and generate stiffness. We show that the stacked origami can exhibit two unique stiffness characteristics due to the nonlinear relationships between the internal pressure and folding deformation, as well as the interactions between pressurized tubes. One characteristic is negative stiffness, and the other is quasi-zero stiffness (QZS). Both of these stiffness characteristics are programmable by tailoring the Miura-Ori crease design, and controllable by adjusting the pressurization. This research would uncover the physical principles behind these stiffness characteristics, provide design guidelines, and discuss the potentials of developing the stacked origami into an adaptive structure with multiple and embedded dynamic functionalities.

S	Wen, Xiaoyan; Shuai, Huang; Wang, Hanzheng; Xiao, Hai; Min, Li			IEEE					A Novel SERS Substrate Based on Silver Nanoparticles-capsulated Single Porous Glass Microsphere								2016 6TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MANIPULATION, MANUFACTURING AND MEASUREMENT ON THE NANOSCALE (IEEE 3M-NANO)		International Conference on Manipulation Manufacturing and Measurement on the Nanoscale						231	235					2016	2016	A novel surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate based on silver nanoparticles-capsulated porous glass microsphere (PGM) has been investigated. Ag+ ions were introduced into PGM interior as precursors, during which compressed CO2 gas with 150 psi pressure was employed to increase Ag+ loading capacity. After that Ag+ ions were in situ reduced to form Ag nanoparticles. The synthesized sample was characterized by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectrometer. As a result Ag nanoparticles encapsulation has been identified. SERS performance was evaluated by Rhodamine 6G and benzoic acid solutions, and obvious Raman enhancement was obtained. The enhancement effect was revealed to be superior to similar substrates, Ag-coated porous and nonporous microsphere prepared via silver mirror reaction. Response of Ag-capsulated PGM and large Ag-coated NPGM to Hg2+ were demonstrated. With the advantages of Raman enhancement, small size, fabrication convenience and operation flexibility, Ag-capsulated PGM is believed to have considerable application prospect in chemical and biological micro-sensor area.					6th IEEE International Conference on Manipulation, Manufacturing and Measurement on the Nanoscale (IEEE 3M-NANO)6th IEEE International Conference on Manipulation, Manufacturing and Measurement on the Nanoscale (IEEE 3M-NANO)	JUL 18-22, 2016JUL 18-22, 2016	IEEE; CIGIT; Changchun Univ Sci & TechnolIEEE; CIGIT; Changchun Univ Sci & Technol	Chongqing, PEOPLES R CHINAChongqing, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0			2373-5422		978-1-5090-2945-7	WOS:000393187700048
