Assembly of NGS reads still face great challenges due to the short reads and enormous high volume. In this paper, we presented a new assembler, called GAMR, which is based on bi-directed de Bruijn graph and implemented using MapReduce framework. We designed distributed algorithm for each step in GAMR, making it scalable in assembling large-scale genomes. We evaluated GAMR using GAGE's data and compared it against other NGS assemblers. The results showed GAMR assembled contigs and scaffolds with better accuracy and longer N50 values.

Despite progress in symbolic motion planning, many challenges remain, including addressing scalability for multi-robot systems and improving solutions by incorporating human intelligence in an adaptive fashion. In this paper, we use local communication, observation, control protocols, and compositional reasoning approaches to decompose the planning problem to address scalability. To address solution quality and adaptability, we use a dynamic and computational trust model to aid this decomposition and to implement real-time switching between automated and human motion planning. A simulation is provided demonstrating the successful implementation of these methods.

This situation could be advantageous to commercial vehicle operators if they are able to cost-effectively modify their fleets to replace a portion of their diesel fuel usage with natural gas. Dual-fuel retrofit kits are an attractive option since they can use existing vehicles and offer relatively low conversion cost as compared to engine replacement. These systems convert dedicated diesel engines to operate on dual-fuel with the addition of intake fumigated natural gas. Fumigated dual-fuel systems replace a significant portion of diesel fuel energy with natural gas (generally 50% or more by energy content), and produce lower operating costs than diesel-only operation. This research describes a methodology, which can be used to predict the return on investment for a dual fuel vehicle and specify the $/mile gain if the vehicle is fitted with dual fuel technology. As a case study, a generic class 8 vehicle is chosen to evaluate the benefit of dual fuel system integration considering overall return of investment.

Heat released during combustion elevates TBC surface temperatures, directly impacting gas-wall heat transfer. Determining the magnitude and phasing of the associated TBC surface temperature swing is critical for correlating coating properties with the measured impact on combustion and efficiency. Although fast-response thermocouples provide a direct measurement of combustion chamber surface temperature in a metal engine, the temperature and heat flux profiles at the TBC-treated gas-wall boundary are difficult to measure directly. Thus, a technique is needed to process the signal measured at the sub-TBC sensor location and infer the corresponding TBC surface temperature profile. This task can be described as an Inverse Heat Conduction Problem (IHCP), and it cannot be solved using the conventional analytic/numeric techniques developed for 'direct' heat flux measurements.This paper proposes using an Inverse Heat Conduction solver based on the Sequential Function Specification Method (SFSM) to estimate heat flux and temperature profiles at the wall-gas boundary from measured sub-TBC temperature. The inverse solver is validated ex situ under HCCI like thermal conditions in a custom fabricated radiation chamber where fast response thermocouples are exposed to a known heat pulse in a controlled environment. The analysis is extended in situ, to evaluate surface conditions in a single-cylinder, gasoline-fueled, HCCI engine. The resulting SFSM-based inverse analysis provides crank angle resolved TBC surface temperature profiles over a host of operational conditions.Such metrics may be correlated with TBC thermophysical properties to determine the impact(s) of material selection on engine performance, emissions, heat transfer, and efficiencies. These efforts will also guide next-generation TBC design.

Thermal Barrier Coatings (TBCs) enable selective manipulation of combustion chamber surface temperature profiles throughout a fired cycle. In this way, TBCs enable a dynamic surface temperature swing, which prevents charge heating during intake while minimizing heat rejection during combustion. This preserves volumetric efficiency while fostering more complete combustion and reducing emissions.This study investigates the effect of a Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) coating on Low Temperature Combustion (LTC) engine combustion, efficiency, and emissions. This is an initial step in a systematic effort to engineer coatings best suited for LTC concepts. A YSZ coating was applied to the top of the aluminum piston using a powder Air Plasma Spray process, Final thickness of the coatings was approximately 150 microns. The coated piston was subsequently evaluated in the single cylinder HCCI engine with exhaust re-induction.Engine tests indicated significant advancement of the autoignition point and reduced combustion durations with the YSZ coating. Hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions were reduced, thereby increasing combustion efficiency. The combination of higher combustion efficiency and decreased heat loss during combustion produced tangible improvements in thermal efficiency. When the effects of combustion advance were removed, the overall improvements in emissions and efficiency were lower, but still significant. Overall, the results encourage continued efforts to devise novel coatings for LTC.

Current cylinder air charge estimation methodologies generally depend upon either a mass air flow (MAF) sensor or a manifold absolute pressure (MAP) sensor individually. Methods based on either sensor have their own advantages and disadvantages. Some production vehicles are equipped with both MAF and MAP sensors to offer air charge estimation and other benefits. This research proposes several observer based cylinder air charge estimation methods that take advantage of both MAF and MAP sensors to potentially reduce calibration work while providing acceptable transient and steady-state accuracy with low computational load. This research also compares several common air estimation methods with the proposed observer based algorithms using steady-state and transient dynamometer tests and a rapid-prototype engine controller. With appropriate tuning the proposed observer based methods are able to estimate cylinder air charge mass under different engine operating conditions based on the manifold model and available sensors. Methods are validated and compared based on a continuous tip-in tip-out operating condition.

Both recirculated and tail pipe exhaust gas streams are utilized as heat sources via a parallel evaporator configuration. A dynamic, physics-based ORC model is utilized to determine optimized net power production. The optimization variables include: working fluid pump speed, mass flow distribution ratio for the parallel evaporators, turbine speed, and the pump speed of condenser cooling fluid. A sensitivity analysis is conducted for all optimization variables. Working fluid pump speed and expansion turbine speed are demonstrated as the most sensitive variables. Sensitivity results indicate increasing system power production as the working fluid mass flow rate increases. A map is developed to identify optimal and safe ORC operating regions for a given engine cycle. Based on the sensitivity analysis working fluid pump speed is selected as the variable of interest in the steady state optimization and results indicate that system power generation could be improved by as much as 25%.Analysis of two quasi steady operational cycles, a multi mode and a constant speed variable load are conducted. ORC power results indicate that a speed-constrained, mechanically coupled turbine expander operates in its peak efficiency zone to produce maximum power output for the steady-state cycles tested. These steady state power optimization results can be used for future power optimization during engine transients.

B	Xu, Shuonan; Yamakawa, Hirotaka; Nishida, Keiya; Filipi, Zoran			ASME					QUASI-D DIESEL ENGINE COMBUSTION MODELING WITH IMPROVED DIESEL SPRAY TIP PENETRATION, IGNITION DELAY AND HEAT RELEASE SUB-MODELS								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE FALL TECHNICAL CONFERENCE, 2016										V001T06A015				2016	2016	Increasingly stringent fuel economy and CO2 emission regulations provide a strong impetus for development of high efficiency engine technologies. Diesel engines dominate the heavy duty market and significant segments of the global light duty market due to their intrinsically higher thermal efficiency compared to spark ignited (SI) engine counterparts. Predictive simulation tools can significantly reduce the time and cost associated with optimization of engine injection strategies, and enable investigation over a broad operating space unconstrained by availability of prototype hardware. In comparison with 0-D/1-D and 3-D simulations, Quasi-D models offer a balance between predictiveness and computational effort, thus making them very suitable for enhancing the fidelity of engine system simulation tools. A most widely used approach for diesel engine applications is a multi-zone spray and combustion model pioneered by Hiroyasu and his group. It divides diesel spray into packets and tracks fuel evaporation, air entrainment, gas properties and ignition delay (induction time) individually during the injection and combustion event. However, original sub-models are not well suited for modern diesel engines, and the main objective of this work is to develop a multi-zonal simulation capable of capturing the impact of high-injection pressures and Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR). In particular, a new spray tip penetration sub-model is developed based on measurements obtained in a high-pressure, high-temperature constant volume combustion vessel for pressures as high as 1450 bar. Next, ignition delay correlation is modified to capture the effect of reduced oxygen concentration in engines with EGR, and an algorithm considering the chemical reaction rate of hydrocarbon-oxygen mixture improves prediction of the heat release rates. Spray and combustion predictions were validated with experiments on a single-cylinder diesel engine with common rail fuel injection, charge boosting, and EGR.

Thus, accurate prediction of the intake charge mass flow rate is paramount. Current speed-density air mass-flow prediction techniques require extensive calibration for predicting volumetric efficiency, while mass air flow (MAF) meter based approaches suffer from a loss of accuracy during transients. This work aims to provide an alternative, i.e. a Model based air charge estimation algorithm that can reduce calibration effort and provide a universal solution across engine platforms. An additional objective is to minimize the number of required sensors and associated cost. The foundation is established with a 0-D physics-based air charge model, where air flow through intake and exhaust valves is modeled on a crank-angle basis, without the need to measure in-cylinder pressure. The proposed algorithm solves differential equations for cylinder pressure and mass flow rate in/out of the cylinder to simultaneously obtain instantaneous pressure and mass-flow estimations, hence eliminating the need to install cylinder pressure transducers. An additional benefit is the robustness of the new model, due to its ability to self-compensate for an error in the intake runner pressure or initial estimation of the cylinder pressure. The model has been validated with GT-Power simulations and steady-state engine tests with multiple actuator sweeps. Transient tests and real-time implementations were performed as well.

Incorporation of interlocking dog clutches in these transmissions decreases package space and increases efficiency, as compared to conventional dry or wet clutches. Unlike friction based clutches, interlocking dog clutches require very precise rotational speed matching prior to engagement. Precise engine speed control is therefore critical to maintaining high shift quality. This research focuses on controlling the engine speed during a gearshift period by manipulating throttle position and combustion phasing. Model predictive control (MPC) is advantageous in this application since the speed profile of a future prediction horizon is known with relatively high confidence. The MPC can find the optimal control actions to achieve the designated speed target without invoking unnecessary actuator manipulation and violating hardware and combustion constraints. This research utilizes linear parameter varying (LPV) MPC to control the engine speed during the gearshift period. Combustion stability constraints are considered with a control oriented covariance of indicated mean effective pressure model (COV of IMEP). The proposed MPC engine speed controller is validated with a high-fidelity 0-dimensional engine model with crank angle resolution. Four case studies, based on simulation, investigate the impact of different MPC design parameters. They also demonstrate that the proposed MPC engine controller successfully achieves the speed reference tracking objective while considering combustion variation constraints.

B	Zhu, Qilun; Prucka, Robert; Wang, Shu; Prucka, Michael; Dourra, Hussein			ASME					CONTROL ORIENTED MODELLING OF ENGINE IMEP VARIATION								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE FALL TECHNICAL CONFERENCE, 2016										V001T05A001				2016	2016	Engine cycle-by-cycle combustion variation is a potential source of emissions and drivability issues in automobiles, and has become an important concern for engine control engineers. The nature of turbulent combustion in IC engines means that combustion variations cannot be eliminated completely. Furthermore, it is inevitable for the engine to run at conditions with high combustion variations in most vehicle applications. For example, during gear shifts spark timing can be changed dramatically to help track the fast transitions of torque demand, often resulting in high Coefficient of Variation in Indicated Mean Effective Pressure (COV of IMEP). Under these circumstances, the control engineers have to weigh between combustion variation and other performance demands (i.e. fast torque tracking). An accurate online estimation of COV of IMEP can be beneficial to this process. A calibrated map of COV of IMEP versus engine operating conditions can be an option for engines with few control actuators. As the number of control actuators increases, combustion variation modelling using inputs with physical representations becomes favorable due to the potential for reduced calibration effort. However, since COV of IMEP is a stochastic variable describing the distribution of IMEP output, it can only be modelled empirically. This research proposes a control-oriented real-time COV of IMEP model based on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and inputs from turbulent combustion research. The effects of premixed turbulent combustion variation are analyzed with flame regime analysis in this research after a brief introduction of the experimental setup and engine information. In-cylinder thermodynamics are then evaluated to reveal how the changes of heat release transform into the variation of cylinder pressure, producing COV of IMEP. A range of model input parameters are assessed to determine the set that produces the most accurate prediction of IMEP variation with minimal computational requirements. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is applied to capture the nonlinear coupled correlations between COV of IMEP and model inputs. The ANN is combined with a regression pretreatment to reduce network size and improve extrapolation stability. This computationally efficient single-layer three-neuron ANN COV of IMEP model achieved 0.29% normalized Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Dynamometer tests show that the model performs well outside the training region.

This is done by classifying the previously developed functional composition rules into vocabulary, grammatical, and topological classes and applying them to function structures available in an external design repository. The pruned function structures of electromechanical devices are then evaluated for how accurately market values can be predicted using graph complexity connectivity method. The accuracy is inversely with amount of information and level of detail. Applying the topological rule does not significantly impact the predictive power of the models, while applying the vocabulary rules and the grammar rules reduce the accuracy of the predictions. Finally, the least predictive model set is that which had all rules applied. In this manner, the value of a representation to predict or answer questions is quantified through this research approach.

The current methods to design topology of unit cells has experienced limitations including numerical modeling challenges and trial-and-error associated with topology optimization and intuitive methods, respectively. To address this limitation this paper aims to develop guidelines for redesign of unit cell topology and shape under in-plane shear loading. The guidelines are intended to use design knowledge for helping engineers by providing recommendations at any stage of the design process. In this paper, the guidelines are developed by changing topology characteristics to achieve a desired effective property of a MPCM structure. The effect of individual members such as side connection and transverse connection of MPCM structure when subjected to in-plane shear loading are investigated through conducting a set of numerical simulation on UCs with similar topology and shape characteristics.

To date, the use of solar energy as an auxiliary energy source of on-board fuel has not been extensively investigated, however. The authors investigated the design parameters and techno-economic impacts within a solar photovoltaic (PV) system for use as an on-board auxiliary power source for the internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and plug-in electric vehicles (EVs). The objective is to optimize, by hybridizing, the conventional energy propulsion systems via solar energy based electric propulsion system by means of the on-board PVs system.This study is novel in that the authors investigated the design parameters of the on-board PV system for optimum well-to-tank energy efficiency. The following design parameters were analyzed: the PV device, the geographical solar location, thermal and electrical performances, energy storage, angling on the vehicle surface, mounting configuration and the effect on aerodynamics. A general well-to-tank form was derived for use in any other PV type, PV efficiency value, or installation location. The authors also analyzed the techno-economic value of adding the on-board PVs for ICE vehicles and for plug-in EVs considering the entire Powertrain component lifetime of the current and the projected price scenarios per vehicle lifetime, and driving by solar energy cost ($ per mile). Different driving scenarios were used to represent the driving conditions in all the U.S states at any time, with different vehicles analyzed using different cost scenarios to derive a greater understanding of the usefulness and the challenges inherent in using on-board PV solar technologies.The addition of on-board PVs to cover only 1.0 m2 of vehicle surfaces was found to extend the daily driving range to up to 2 miles for typical 2016 model vehicles, depending upon on vehicle specifications and destination, however over 7.0 miles with the use of extremely lightweight and aerodynamically efficient vehicles in a sunny location. The authors also estimated the maximum possible PV installation area via a unique relationship between the vehicle footprint and the projected horizontal vehicle surface area for different vehicles of varying sizes. It was determined that up to 50% of total daily miles traveled by an average U.S. person could be driven by solar energy, with the simple addition of on-board PVs to cover less than 50% (3.25 m2) of the projected horizontal surface area of a typical mid-size vehicle (e.g., Nissan Leaf or Mitsubishi i-MiEV). Specifically, the addition of the proposed PV module to a 2016 Tesla Model S AWD-70D vehicle in San Diego, CA extended the average daily range to 5.2 miles in that city. Similarly, for the 2016 BMW i3 BEV in Texas, Phoenix, and North Carolina, the range was extended to more than 7.0 miles in those states.The cost of hybridizing a solar technology into a vehicle was also estimated for current and projected prices. The results show for current price scenario, the expense of powering an ICE vehicle within a certain range with only solar energy was between 4 to 23 cents per mile depending upon the vehicle specification and driving location. Future price scenarios determined the driving cost is an optimum of 17 cents per mile. However, the addition of a PV system to an EV improved the economics of the system because of the presence of the standard battery and electric motor components. For any vehicle in any assumed location, the driving cost was found to be less than 6.0 cents per mile even in the current price scenario.The results of this dynamic model are applicable for determining the on-board PV contribution for any vehicle size with different powertrain configurations. Specifically, the proposed work provides a method that designers may use during the conceptual design stage to facilitate the deployment of an alternative energy propulsion system toward future mobility.

A SCALE-UP (Student-Centered Activities for Large-Enrollment Undergraduate Programs) environment is utilized to provide a highly collaborative, hands-on classroom format with a primary emphasis on learning by guided inquiry and live demonstrations rather than by traditional lecturing. One of the goals of using this format is real-time assistance and rapid feedback.In the spring term, each class day, 400 student submit a solid model file. This presents a challenge to returning feedback before the next class period. The current grading method consists of students submitting solid model files to a course management system and awarding credit for submissions matching the mass of the presented design. However, this method does not allow students to earn partial credit based on the relative accuracy of their model. To date, instructors have been unable to reward partial credit in an automated or timely manner.The objective of this research is to evaluate the use of shape similarity algorithms to provide decision making support while grading solid models for this engineering graphics course. The proposed method of automated grading is to use a solid model similarity algorithm and the mass properties to assess the relative similarity of each submission to a correct solid model. The distribution of grades using the proposed method is compared to the existing method's distribution. Use of the proposed method ensures that the results from this research can be applied to other engineering graphics courses, regardless of the solid modeling software used.

This is possible by exploiting the redundancy of the drive system to generate additional yaw moment and to maximize the utilization of individual tire-road contacts without significant extra power consumption by the drive motors. This paper aims at improving the efficiency of torque allocation with the addition of active steering while enhancing the dynamic performance of the independent hub motor driven multi-axle vehicles. The control algorithm outlined here employs a two level scheme. The higher level computes the desired global control efforts that are needed to track the reference yaw rate and slip angle state responses generated by a reference vehicle model, and the lower level executes optimal control allocation with a cost function that simultaneously takes into account I) maximization of the tire utilization on all axles considering dominant tire nonlinearities, and 2) minimization of the actuation efforts of the active steering system and the distributed motor torques. The validity of the proposed algorithm is verified via comparison of the simulations of the control allocation scheme applied to a high fidelity multi-axle vehicle under several aggressive test maneuvers with different actuation configurations. The results suggest that the addition of active steering provides lower actuator power consumption and tire usage while ensuring enhanced lateral and longitudinal dynamic performance for the vehicle.

Single point incremental forming is a production process for forming sheet materials without the use of dedicated tooling (dies/molds). The process is an alternative to thermoforming for low volume forming of sheets. It involves forming the final shape through a series of localized incremental deformations. It has been observed that heat assisted techniques have shown an improvement in the formability limits for sheet metals. In this research, this concept has been tested for improving the formability of polymer sheets. Hot air us used to increase the temperature within a localized region in front of the tool. A single point incremental forming device is modified through the development of a specialized tool holder and nozzle which heats the polymer sheet to temperatures higher than the room temperature but below the glass transition temperature of the polymer and applies the forming loads.The results from the experiments are summarized as: i) the formability angle increases of polystyrene from 27 degrees to 46 degrees when comparing room temperature forming to forming at an elevated temperature (170 degrees F-180 degrees F), ii) a reduction in the forces needed for forming is observed qualitatively, and iii) the surface finish on the formed parts do not show visible change. This demonstrates promise of manufacturing complex shapes from thermoplastic polymer sheets using heat assisted incremental forming. Future research includes 1) simulating the localized deformation of the material to enable process planning, 2) quantifying the forming forces and heat control of the system, and 3) exploring the manufacturing technique to other materials.

This was done by converting the assembly models into bipartite graphs and extracting 29 graph complexity metrics which were used to train the ANN prediction models. This paper presents the use of sub-assembly models instead of the entire assembly model to predict assembly quality defects at an automotive OEM. The size of the training set, order of the bipartite graph, selection of training set, and defect type were experimentally studied. With a training size of 28 parts, an interpolation focused training set selection, and second order graph seeding, over 70% of the predictions were within 100% of the target value. The study shows that with an increase in training size and careful selection of training sets, assembly defects can be predicted reliably from sub-assemblies complexity data.

To that end, a harvester consisting of a piezoelectric cantilever beam augmented with a square-sectioned bluff body at the free end is considered. Two repulsive magnets located at the tip of the beam are used to introduce the bi-stable restoring force. Unsteadiness is generated in a wind tunnel using static grid structures located in the upstream of the bluff body. Three different mesh screens with square bars are designed with different bar and mesh widths to control the Reynolds numbers and associated unsteadiness. A series of wind tunnel tests are then used to experimentally investigate the response of the harvester with and without the tip magnets. Results demonstrate that the bi-stable restoring force can be used to improve the output power of the harvester under unsteady flow conditions.

In specific, the paper addresses the influence of surface tension represented by a coefficient, 0, and the ratio between the fluid height and the container's width, represented by h/L, on the nonlinear normal sloshing modes. To achieve this objective, we first study the influence of 13, and, h/L, on the modal frequencies and generate a map in the (h/L, beta) parameters' space to highlight regions of possible nonlinear internal resonances up to the fifth mode. The map is used to characterize the regions where a single uncoupled nonlinear mode is sufficient to capture the response of surface waves. For these regions, we study the influence of surface tension on the effective nonlinearity of the first four modes and illustrate its considerable influence on the softening/hardening behavior of the uncoupled nonlinear modes. Subsequently, we investigate the response of the sloshing waves near internal resonance of the two-to-one type. We show that, in the vicinity of these internal resonances, the steady-state sloshing response can either contain a contribution from the two interacting modes (coupled-mode response) or only the higher frequency mode (uncoupled high frequencymode response). We show that the regions where the coupled-mode uniquely exists has a clear dependence on the surface tension.

ASME					EXPLOITING A TAIL FIN TO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF GALLOPING FLOW ENERGY HARVESTERS								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, 2016, VOL 6										UNSP V006T09A046				2016	2016	Flow energy harvesters (FhHs) have recently emerged as a major player in the field of micro-power generation. Such devices are designed to harness energy from a dynamic flow field, typically wind, in order to power remote, sub-milliwatt consumption sensors that are hard to access or maintain. Previous research efforts have focused on harnessing flow energy under nearly steady conditions where measurable variations in the flow speed occur at a much longer time scale than the time constant of the harvester itself. Under such conditions, the nature of the harvester's transient response is irrelevant and does not constitute a critical performance criterion. However, since gusts of wind also contain a significant amount of energy, designing FLHs to have a fast transient response is essential to capture the maximum possible energy from the flow. To address this critical issue, we propose a galloping piezoelectric energy harvester consisting of piezoelectric cantilever beam with a modified bluff body mounted at its tip. Square, trapezoid, and triangle bluff bodies were tested, each augmented with a tail fin to enhance the transient response of the harvester. It is shown experimentally that the settling time of the response and the steady state output power can be improved substantially when the fin is added.

To achieve this goal, the method of multiple scales is utilized to construct analytical solutions describing the amplitude and stability of the intra- and inter-well dynamics of the harvester. Using these solutions, critical bifurcations in the parameter's space are identified and used to define an effective frequency bandwidth of the harvester. A piezoelectric tri-stable energy harvester consisting of a uni-morph cantilever beam is considered. Stiffness nonlinearities are introduced into the harvesters design by applying a static magnetic field near the tip of the beam. Experimental studies performed on the harvester are presented to validate some of the theoretical findings.

Design problems form an essential component of experiments in creativity research. However, the formulation of a design problem for an experiment is still a challenging task. An opportunity for the design community is leverage existing design problems to reduce a source of difference between experiments and increase the validity of new method and tools. To answer this question, fifty-five design problems, published over the past fifteen years, were collected and analyzed using two approaches. First, the information content of the design problems was assessed based on five structural elements. A protocol study was developed with four independent evaluators, who were asked to identify the five elements in a set of design problems. A high correlation was observed for the characteristics: goal of a problem, functional requirements, non-functional requirement and reference to an existing product. A low correlation was observed for the characteristics information about end user. The results suggest that this approach could serve as a useful tool in comparing and selecting problems with a desired number of elements. In the second approach, latent semantic analysis was used to compare the design problems. Latent semantic analysis enables design problem similarity to be computed prior to solving the problem. However, this method cannot identify the nuances in problem representations, which could potentially affect solution development. The paper concludes with an appeal to research community of using similar or benchmarked design problems, and postulate other means to enable comparison or development of problems in creativity research.

Unlike many other engineering design tools that are collaborative allowing many designers to contribute to the design task, function modeling has not been historically presented as a collaborative tool. This paper presents a controlled experimental study that explores the how different initial function models are completed by novice engineers influence the number of functions added to the model. Eighty-eight senior mechanical engineering students were given partial function models to two similarly complex engineering design problems. Each student was asked to complete the function model to best address the problem presented. The number of added functions was compared considering two variables: percent completed of initial seed model (10%, 40%, and 80%), initial chaining of functions (forward, backward, and nucleation). It was found that models for Backward Chaining and Nucleation at 10% initial seed resulted in the greatest addition of functions by the students. Further, Backward Chaining and Nucleation yielded more added functions than Forward Chaining in all seed configurations. Recognizing that there is a difference between Forward Chaining and Backward Chaining or Nucleation, further study is warranted to understand how individuals create function models and which approach yields more useful models to either understand the problem presented or to explore solution options.

As a result, several wind turbine nacelle test benches have been built to perform such testing with the intent of loading the integrated components as they are in the field. However when mounted on a test bench the nacelle is not on the top of a tower and does not have blades attached to it this is a form of abstraction. This paper aims to quantify the influence of such an abstraction on the dynamic response of the nacelle through a series of simulation case studies. The responses of several nacelle components are studied including the main bearing, main shaft, gearbox supports, generator, and yaw bearing interface. Results are presented to highlight the differences in the dynamic response of the nacelle caused by the abstraction. Additionally, the authors provide recommendations for mitigating the effects of the abstraction.

A comprehensive scalable WPT ecosystem will comprise of not only vehicles and charging controllers but will also include multiple value chain providers such as charge station operators, power generation and grid management companies and vehicle manufacturers etc. So a communication system should not only address the immediate first-hop communication between the vehicle and charging controller but also provide a robust end-to-end communication solution that addresses scalability, real-time response characteristics, in a cyber-secure manner.This paper summarizes the combined efforts of Clemson University and Cisco Systems related to the development of a communication system for stationary, quasi-dynamic and dynamic WPT under DOE FOA 0000667 that addresses these aspects. The implementation used Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) technology as the wireless technology and applied the Fog computing framework as the base for the overall architecture. This approach provided 1) ultralow latency communication between the vehicle and the infrastructure required by WPT real-time control loop, and 2) edge analytics for vehicles and grid components and interaction with WPT cloud.

J	Bodde, David L.; Sun, Jianan			IEEE					Emergent Entrepreneurial Networks for the Transition to Automated Urban Mobility								2016 IEEE TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION CONFERENCE AND EXPO (ITEC)														2016	2016	Simulation models show significant benefits can accrue to cities from integrating shared, automated, electric vehicles into an optimized mobility system. Gains include reduced air pollution, lower carbon emissions, reduced traffic congestion, and more green space. Yet the current enthusiasm for such visionary systems ignores the transition period, the time during which AV must share limited road space with human-driven vehicles. Such social-technical transitions are marked by great uncertainty regarding technology performance, legal/regulatory acceptance, and customer preference. This, in turn, creates a high-risk business environment for entrepreneurs and corporate innovators. Emergent entrepreneurial networks are uniquely suited to managing the risk and accelerating the transition to fully optimized urban mobility systems. These combine the skills of entrepreneurs and corporate innovators into highly adaptable, learning-based networks. We can observe 4 distinct models for these networks emerging into the urban mobility market. A better understanding of the competition among these models can inform national policies promoting shared, automated electric mobility service. We propose a case-learning process through which the needed understanding can be achieved.

J	Wang, Lei; Pierson, Marissa A.; Marcus, R. Kenneth								Coupling of capillary-channeled polymer (C-CP) fibers for reversed phase liquid chromatography and ESI-MS for the determination of proteins in a urine matrix								Analytical Methods				8	48			8410	8419		10.1039/c6ay02737g			2016	2016	Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis provides a great deal of analytical information as a detection mode when coupled with liquid chromatography (LC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE) separations of proteins. However, limitations to low flow rates (<0.5 mL min(-1)) for optimal spectral clarity and greatest sensitivity for conventional ESI generally imply low linear velocities (similar to 4 mm s(-1) for packed bed formats) and slow LC separations. Capillary-channeled polymer (C-CP) fibers have been employed for fast protein separations, explicitly for the capability to operate at high linear velocities, without van Deemter C-term penalties. In order to maintain the preferred high linear velocities (>50 mm s(-1)), while also using volume flow rates compatible with standard ESI-MS, smaller column diameters are evaluated with the intension to match the high chromatographic throughput demonstrated through UV-Vis absorbance detection with the high information fidelity of the MS detection. Mixtures of ribonuclease A, cytochrome c, myoglobin and lysozyme were prepared in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and urine matrices. The efficiency of the matrix removal is reflected in the near-identical qualitative and quantitative responses in both cases. It is felt that C-CP microbore columns can provide the high throughput and solute recoveries desired in top-down proteomics applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1759-9660	1759-9679		WOS:000393101400003		
J	Capocasa, Marco; McCuen, Virginia; Venier, Beatrice; Rufo, Fabrizio								Between universal and local: Towards an evolutionary anthropology of emotions								ANTHROPOLOGICAL NOTEBOOKS				22	2			31	42					2016	2016	Since the days of Darwin, emotion has widely been regarded as a fundamental contribution to natural selection for its benefit toward survival. The evolutionary approach drove Paul Ekman's ground-breaking yet controversial research on the Fore tribe of New Guinea. Eckman concluded that there are six emotions that are expressed by all human beings. His universalist view contrasts with those of many anthropologists, such as Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson, who regard emotion as foremost socially-learned and ascribable almost exclusively to the realm of culture. A marriage between universalism and culturalism has been proposed, giving rise to the new field of study known as neuroanthropology, suggesting the importance of the emotions in the embodiment of socio-cultural factors.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1408-032X			WOS:000392662400002		
J	Watson, M. K.; Drapcho, C. M.								KINETICS OF INORGANIC CARBON-LIMITED FRESHWATER ALGAL GROWTH AT HIGH PH								Transactions of the ASABE				59	6			1633	1643		10.13031/trans.59.11520			2016	2016	Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations necessitate exploration of carbon management strategies to combat high CO2 emissions. Carbon sequestration, which includes capture and storage of inorganic carbon, is one potential component of a carbon management plan. In particular, utilization of atmospheric CO2 by algae has been proposed for carbon capture, particularly at high pH since CO2 absorption rates increase with increasing pH. The goal of this study was to quantify the growth and inorganic carbon utilization of a mixed freshwater green algal culture at high pH. Algal cultures were supplied with different initial media inorganic carbon concentrations (11 to 32 mg C L-1 as Na2CO3), maintained in a controlled environment, and adjusted to an initial pH of 10.3. Samples were taken daily to measure pH, alkalinity, inorganic carbon, and total suspended solids. Results indicated that the culture was dominated by Scenedesmus at all inorganic carbon concentrations. Peak biomass, specific growth rate, and biomass carbon content generally increased with increasing initial inorganic carbon concentration. Nonlinear regression was used to estimate a maximum specific growth rate of 0.0727 h(-1) and half-saturation constants of 5.36 x 10(-4), 6.84, 10.4, and 17.5 mg C L-1 for CO2, HCO3-, CO32, and total inorganic carbon, respectively. Comparison of changes in the concentrations of inorganic carbon species due to pH increase and utilization by algae suggest that CO2, HCO3-, and CO32- (i.e., total inorganic carbon) contributed to biomass production. Overall, the determined stoichiometric and kinetic parameters can be used to facilitate modeling and optimization of algal-based carbon capture strategies.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2151-0032	2151-0040		WOS:000392932500015

IEEE					Understanding Undergraduate Engineering Researchers and How They Learn								2016 IEEE FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE (FIE)		Frontiers in Education Conference												2016	2016	As the need for qualified science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) graduates increases, there is an accompanying need for improved undergraduate STEM education. Undergraduate Research Experiences (UREs) have been shown to enhance an undergraduate student's academic experience; however, not all students can participate in or have access to UREs due to schedule constraints during the school year or other commitments in the summer. Our current research project seeks to determine how students develop a researcher identity and transform their epistemic beliefs through UREs. Elements identified to contribute to students' researcher identities and epistemic beliefs will then be translated into strategies that can be incorporated into traditional learning environments. This paper will overview the progress made in the first part of this multi-phase, multi-institution project and preliminary results from the initial surveys.

IEEE					Exploring the Intersection of Veteran Status, Age, and Engineering Study								2016 IEEE FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE (FIE)		Frontiers in Education Conference												2016	2016	Student veterans have become an increasing presence in higher education. We seek to understand the role of the military as a pathway into engineering for student veteran engineers as well as investigate the character and content of their educational experiences. The results of seven focus groups with 29 student veterans indicate that the decision to major in engineering is often, but not always, related to their service. Veteran students are often open with faculty about their veteran status, however they are less likely to reveal it to other students. Veterans believe that their status as a veteran is a significant asset in engineering studies but that their age is less so.

In addition to responding to the items on an anchored scale, the students were asked to provide short written explanations of their responses in a textbox below each item. Students' open-ended responses were analyzed using qualitative content analysis to gather content validity evidence and gain a general understanding of students' engineering epistemic beliefs. This analysis revealed inconsistencies with how students interpret the items and ambiguous terms used in the items.

IEEE					Understanding the role of knowledge related to financial resources on decisions to attend graduate school								2016 IEEE FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE (FIE)		Frontiers in Education Conference												2016	2016	Although many factors exist as to why students choose not to pursue graduate study, one significant barrier is the lack of knowledge regarding financial resources available to pursue such study. To explore this, we developed and launched a pilot survey that probed student career plans, current and perceived financial resources, perceptions about the application process for graduate school and the role of finances in their decision to pursue an advanced degree. We also interviewed three undergraduate respondents to further elucidate their views of the utility of graduate degrees in their field and how they went about gathering knowledge about the financial support available for graduate studies. The findings confirmed that most undergraduate students begin to consider graduate school as juniors and seniors. While the participants most often selected financial factors as influencing their graduate school decisions, interviews showed that students amassed financial knowledge from their acquaintances within industry or from graduate students in other disciplines.

IEEE					Combining MeSH Thesaurus with UMLS in Pseudo Relevance Feedback to Improve Biomedical Information Retrieval								2016 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING AND APPLICATIONS (ICKEA 2016)								67	71					2016	2016	With the rapid increase in the volume of biomedical publications, developing an efficient search strategy to retrieve relevant biomedical documents that match the user search intention is a tremendous challenge. This paper proposes a novel pseudo relevance feedback technique which combines MeSH terms and UMLS concepts to improve the performance of retrieving biomedical documents from MEDLINE. The MeSH terms that annotate the feedback documents and the UMLS concepts derived from the feedback documents are used to help retrieve publications relevant to the user query. Extensive performance studies using the OHSUMED collection show that the proposed pseudo relevance feedback scheme using both MeSH terms and UMLS concepts improves the retrieval performance by 43.3% over the approach based on unexpanded query in terms of mean average precision.

A signal value can correspond to a purely real or purely imaginary value, while a complex signal consists of 2 signal values. For an N-point RFFT, each stage need not compute more than N signal values, since the degrees of freedom of the input data is N. Any more than N signal values computed at any stage is inherently redundant. Canonic RFFT algorithms are defined as those RFFT algorithms that have the least number of signals at each FFT stage. In order to reduce the redundant samples, a sample removal lemma, and two types of twiddle factor transformations are proposed: pushing and modulation. We consider 4 different cases. Canonic RFFT for any composite length can be computed by applying the proposed algorithm recursively. Performances of different RFFTs are also discussed in this paper. The major advantages of the canonic RFFTs are that they require the least butterfly operations, lead to more regular sub-blocks in the data-flow, and only involve real datapath when mapped to architectures.

Assuming that organizations periodically face various supply chain risks, the authors intend to show that managers can develop these antecedent competencies in ways that bolster their supply chain risk management (SCRM) capabilities.Design/methodology/approach - To understand the relationships between the antecedents and SCRM capabilities, the authors used Q-sorts and confirmatory factor analysis to develop new warning and recovery measures. The authors then collected survey data from 231 hospital supply managers and analyzed these records using structural equation modeling.Findings - The results indicate that internal integration and training positively affect organizations' warning and recovery capabilities, in both a direct and indirect manner. The authors also illustrate how managers can leverage their SCRM capabilities to affect operational performance.Research limitations/implications -These results suggest that by developing antecedent competencies like internal integration and training, firms may bolster their warning and recovery capabilities, and ultimately operational performance of the organization.Originality/value - The findings provide hospital supply organizations and other inventory management teams with a novel approach to managing an evolving array of supply chain risks. Rather than investing in costly risk management techniques, like inventory stocks, organizations can use internal integration and training to improve their SCRM capabilities.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0960-0035	1758-664X		WOS:000392179200004

GPUs have now become a mainstream parallel computation device in HPC, and optimizing power usage on GPUs is critical to achieving future goals. GPU memory is seldom studied, especially for power usage. Nevertheless, memory accesses draw significant power and are critical to understanding and optimizing GPU power usage. In this work we investigate the power and performance characteristics of various GPU memory accesses. We take an empirical approach and experimentally examine and evaluate how GPU power and performance vary with data access patterns and software parameters including GPU thread block size. In addition, we take into account the advanced power saving technology dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) on GPU processing units and global memory. We analyze power and performance and provide some suggestions for the optimal parameters for applications that heavily use specific memory operations.					4th International Workshop on Energy Efficient Supercomputing (E2SC)4th International Workshop on Energy Efficient Supercomputing (E2SC)	NOV 13-18, 2016NOV 13-18, 2016	Assoc Comp Machinery; IEEE Comp Soc; SIGHPCAssoc Comp Machinery; IEEE Comp Soc; SIGHPC	Salt Lake, UTSalt Lake, UT	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-5090-3856-5	WOS:000392312700007

However, developing applications for these intermittently-powered, batteryless devices is notoriously demanding.

In this paper we present an instruction level simulator based off of MSPsim for intermittently-powered devices that can accurately emulate real-world energy harvesting conditions, taking into account power models of common hardware peripherals like a radio, and accelerometer. These harvester conditions are represented by IV surfaces recorded by the Ekho hardware emulator We have provided this simulator as an open source tool for the benefit of the community.					4th International Workshop on Energy Harvesting and Energy Neutral Systems (ENSsys)4th International Workshop on Energy Harvesting and Energy Neutral Systems (ENSsys)	NOV 16, 2016NOV 16, 2016	Assoc Comp MachineryAssoc Comp Machinery	Stanford, CAStanford, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4503-4532-3	WOS:000392303700005

The identification procedure is outlined and numerically implemented on a Duffing-type system with unknown quadratic and cubic nonlinearities. The proposed technique is then implemented to identify the nonlinear parameters of three different experimental systems. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach predicts the nonlinear parameters with good accuracy.

While controlling acoustic wave propagation has large impact on many engineering applications, studies on broadband acoustic bandgap (ABG) adaptation is still outstanding. One of the important properties of periodic structure in ABG design is the lattice-type. It is possible that by reconfiguring the periodic architectures between different lattice-types with fundamentally distinct dispersion relations, we may achieve broadband wave propagation tuning. In this spirit, this research pioneers a new class of reconfigurable periodic structures called origami metastructures (OM) that can achieve ABG adaption via topology reconfiguration by rigid folding. It is found that origami folding, which can enable significant and precise topology reconfigurations between distinct Bravais lattice-types in underlying periodic architecture, can bring about drastic changes in wave propagation behavior. Such versatile wave transmission control is demonstrated via numerical studies that couple wave propagation theory with origami folding kinematics. Further, we also exploit the novel ABG adaptation feature of OM to design structures that can exhibit unique tunable non reciprocal behavior.

In this survey we will focus on kernels of Toeplitz operators. This raises two questions. First, how can one decide whether such a kernel is non trivial? We will discuss in some details the results starting with Makarov and Poltoratski in 2005 and their succeeding authors concerning this topic. In connection with these results we will also mention some intimately related applications to completeness problems, spectral gap problems and Polya sequences. Second, if the kernel is non-trivial, what can be said about the structure of the kernel, and what kind of information on the Toeplitz operator can be deduced from its kernel? In this connection we will review a certain number of results starting with work by Hayashi, Hitt and Sarason in the late 80's on the extremal function.

J	Lamb, Juliet S; O'Reilly, Kathleen M; Jodice, Patrick G R								Physical condition and stress levels during early development reflect feeding rates and predict pre- and post-fledging survival in a nearshore seabird.								Conservation physiology				4	1			cow060	cow060					2016	2016	The effects of acute environmental stressors on reproduction in wildlife are often difficult to measure because of the labour and disturbance involved in collecting accurate reproductive data. Stress hormones represent a promising option for assessing the effects of environmental perturbations on altricial young; however, it is necessary first to establish how stress levels are affected by environmental conditions during development and whether elevated stress results in reduced survival and recruitment rates. In birds, the stress hormone corticosterone is deposited in feathers during the entire period of feather growth, making it an integrated measure of background stress levels during development. We tested the utility of feather corticosterone levels in 3- to 4-week-old nestling brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis) for predicting survival rates at both the individual and colony levels. We also assessed the relationship of feather corticosterone to nestling body condition and rates of energy delivery to nestlings. Chicks with higher body condition and lower corticosterone levels were more likely to fledge and to be resighted after fledging, whereas those with lower body condition and higher corticosterone levels were less likely to fledge or be resighted after fledging. Feather corticosterone was also associated with intracolony differences in survival between ground and elevated nest sites. Colony-wide, mean feather corticosterone predicted nest productivity, chick survival and post-fledging dispersal more effectively than did body condition, although these relationships were strongest before fledglings dispersed away from the colony. Both reproductive success and nestling corticosterone were strongly related to nutritional conditions, particularly meal delivery rates. We conclude that feather corticosterone is a powerful predictor of reproductive success and could provide a useful metric for rapidly assessing the effects of changes in environmental conditions, provided pre-existing baseline variation is monitored and understood.									0	0	0	0	0	0						MEDLINE:27957336	27957336

Owing to the nature of CVT applications, security flaws can result not only in loss of data or network function but also in fatal accidents. Security mechanisms that can account for privacy, authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation while having an acceptable communication overhead are imperative to the functioning of CVT applications. While this field of study is rapidly evolving with a wide range of studies and security solutions being proposed for different areas of CVT security, literature documenting the comprehensive picture of current security protocols and practices is missing. This paper attempts to remedy this by documenting recent advances in CVT security with the goal of providing an efficient jumping off point for future research in CVT security development.

REPEATED APPLICATION OF FUEL REDUCTION TREATMENTS IN THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS, USA: IMPLICATIONS FOR ACHIEVING MANAGEMENT GOALS								FIRE ECOLOGY				12	2			28	47		10.4996/fireecology.1202028			2016	2016	Fire and resource managers of the southern Appalachian Mountains, USA, have many questions about the use of prescribed fire and mechanical treatments to meet various land management objectives. Three common objectives include restoration to an open woodland, oak regeneration, and fuel reduction. This paper provides information about reaching each of these three management objectives by using prescribed burning (B), mechanical fuel reduction (M), and a combination of both fire and mechanical treatment (MB). The southern Appalachian site of the National Fire and Fire Surrogate study has been burned three times and a mechanical treatment has been conducted twice since 2002. Stand structure was changed by each active treatment but restoration to an open woodland was not achieved by any. The MB treatment units developed the desired overstory structure but heavy sprouting of woody species in the understory prevented the establishment of a diverse herbaceous forest floor. Oak reproduction was increased by all active treatments, largely by sprouting of top-killed stems. The degree of fuel reduction differed by treatment. All treatments reduced the shrub layer, thus reducing the vertical fuel component. The B and MB treatments reduced most fuels and likely reduced the severity of a subsequent wildfire. We conclude that additional burning is required to meet each management objective, and that fires should be conducted more frequently, in different seasons, or in combination with other treatments.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1933-9747			WOS:000391959200004

Many scheduling-based MAC protocols have been proposed that provide contention free transmissions and can guarantee certain levels of performance. One of the major drawbacks of these protocols is that once slots are assigned to a particular node, if the node does not have a packet to transmit, then these slots are not utilized. In our proposed protocol these un-utilized assigned slots are recovered by other nodes, which results in an increase in the capacity of the network.					35th IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)35th IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)	NOV 01-03, 2016NOV 01-03, 2016	IEEE; AFCEA; IEEE Commun SocIEEE; AFCEA; IEEE Commun Soc	Baltimore, MDBaltimore, MD	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-7578		978-1-5090-3781-0	WOS:000391433600012

Our technique allows a receiver to exploit the broadcast nature of the wireless medium by overhearing packets sent by a node that is not necessarily one of the receiver's designated relays. Delivery of the file to the remote destinations is expedited by making efficient utilization of nodes that obtain the file from the source before the relay nodes obtain it. Nodes are not required to transmit multiple packets simultaneously or receive packets from multiple senders simultaneously. An adaptive modulation and channel coding protocol is used to mitigate the effects of fading and shadowing. Performance results are provided for two forms of network coding, fountain coding and random linear network coding.					35th IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)35th IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)	NOV 01-03, 2016NOV 01-03, 2016	IEEE; AFCEA; IEEE Commun SocIEEE; AFCEA; IEEE Commun Soc	Baltimore, MDBaltimore, MD	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-7578		978-1-5090-3781-0	WOS:000391433600072

Recovery of Native Brook Trout Populations Following the Eradication of Nonnative Rainbow Trout in Southern Appalachian Mountains Streams								NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT				36	6			1325	1335		10.1080/02755947.2016.1221004			2016	2016	Nonnative Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss have displaced native Brook Trout Salvelinus fontinalis in many southern Appalachian Mountains streams. We monitored the population recovery of Brook Trout following Rainbow Trout eradication at 10 sites in seven allopatric Rainbow Trout streams located in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, USA. Rainbow Trout were successfully eradicated by electrofishing or Fintrol (also known as antimycin-A), and Brook Trout were reintroduced at low densities (39-156 fish/km) from streams located within the park. Within 2 years after reintroduction, the density and bio-mass of adult Brook Trout recovered to levels comparable to the prerestoration density and biomass of Rainbow Trout. Spawning in the first autumn after reintroduction was assumed by the presence of young-of-the-year fish in seven out of nine sites surveyed during the following summer. Brook Trout density and biomass 3-5 years after restoration did not significantly differ from those in natural allopatric populations within the park in young-of-the-year fish but were significantly lower in adults. Individual body size of adult and young-of-the-year fish were density dependent after restoration, indicating that Brook Trout populations had recovered to a point that habitat saturation triggered intraspecific competition. We conclude that Rainbow Trout removal has been a viable management technique to restore Brook Trout populations in the park.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0275-5947	1548-8675		WOS:000391851900010

Single grid-connected power generators and electronic loads like LED lamps can be easily characterized in terms of harmonics in a given range of frequency. This subject is relatively well understood, and specific standards for measuring and restricting emissions are already established to ensure a low probability of interference. However, when connected together, source and load exhibit behavior that requires further study and understanding. This work presents a discussion serving as a guide for future work on analysis of losses and other impacts of the disturbances regarding this specific load and source interaction. The following are taken into account: the nonlinearity of LED loads and PV converters; the technologies and methods used in control; and the changes in power flow caused by load and power production variations.					17th International Conference on Harmonics and Quality of Power (ICHQP)17th International Conference on Harmonics and Quality of Power (ICHQP)	OCT 16-19, 2016OCT 16-19, 2016	IEEE Power & Energy Soc; CEMIG; Eletrobras Eletronorte; GE; COPEL; CNPq; CAPES; FAPEMIG; Ministerio Minas Energia; Brasil Governo Fed; Ministerio Educacao; Sistema FIEMG; fupai; PARANA Governo Estado; MINAS GERAIS Governo TodosIEEE Power & Energy Soc; CEMIG; Eletrobras Eletronorte; GE; COPEL; CNPq; CAPES; FAPEMIG; Ministerio Minas Energia; Brasil Governo Fed; Ministerio Educacao; Sistema FIEMG; fupai; PARANA Governo Estado; MINAS GERAIS Governo Todos	Belo Horizonte, BRAZILBelo Horizonte, BRAZIL	0	0	0	0	0	0			2164-0610		978-1-5090-3792-6	WOS:000391424200034

Factors Affecting Hospital Length of Stay for Drivers with Traumatic Brain Injuries from Motor Vehicle Crashes South Carolina Case Study								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD					2601			84	89		10.3141/2601-10			2016	2016	Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are a major cause of disability and mortality, and many TBIs are caused by motor vehicle crashes. Hospital length of stay (LOS) is often regarded as a representation of consumption of hospital resources and may also represent injury severity. This study investigated the effects of crash factors and driver characteristics on hospital LOS for drivers sustaining a TBI in traffic crashes. The South Carolina Crash Outcome Data Evaluation System for 2005 to 2007 was used to build a zero-inflated negative binomial regression to predict hospital LOS for drivers experiencing a TBI as a result of a crash. Not wearing a seat belt, ejection from the vehicle, and a crash on a roadway with a high speed limit were factors associated with a greater likelihood of being admitted to the hospital and having longer hospital LOS for drivers sustaining TBIs in crashes. Intoxicated drivers were more likely to be admitted to the hospital but tended to have shorter LOS when they sustained a TBI in a crash. Hospital LOS may be a surrogate measurement of injury severity as well as a representation of health care resource consumption. Understanding the effects of crash factors on hospital LOS for drivers sustaining a TBI in crashes can help policy makers, roadway designers, and health care providers develop specific interventions for understanding traffic crash related health care resource consumption.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0361-1981	2169-4052		WOS:000391903700010

While its ongoing all-sky survey counts thousands of sources, essential issues related to the nature of unassociated sources call for more sensitive all-sky surveys at hard X-ray energies that allow for their identification. This latter energy band encodes the hard-tail of the thermal emission and the soft-tail of non-thermal emission thereby bridging the non-thermal and thermal emission mechanisms of gamma-ray sources. All-sky surveys at hard X-rays are best performed by current coded-mask telescopes Swift/BAT and INTEGRAL/IBIS. To boost the hard X-ray all-sky sensitivity, we have developed an ad hoc technique by combining photons from independent observations of BAT and IBIS. The resulting Swift-INTEGRAL X-ray (SIX) survey has an improved source-number density. This improvement is essential to enhance the positive hard X-ray - gamma-ray source matches. We present the results from the scientific link between the neighboring gamma-ray and hard X-ray bands in the context of galactic and extragalactic source classes of the second catalog Fermi Gamma-ray LAT (2FGL).					14th International Conference on Topics in Astroparticle and Underground Physics (TAUP)14th International Conference on Topics in Astroparticle and Underground Physics (TAUP)	SEP 07-11, 2015SEP 07-11, 2015	Univ Torino; Ist Nazl Fisica Nucl; Ist Nazl Astrofisica; Agenzia Spaziale Italiana; Accademia Scienze Torino, Consorzio Interuniversitario Fis Spaziale; Int Union Pure & Appl PhysUniv Torino; Ist Nazl Fisica Nucl; Ist Nazl Astrofisica; Agenzia Spaziale Italiana; Accademia Scienze Torino, Consorzio Interuniversitario Fis Spaziale; Int Union Pure & Appl Phys	Torino, ITALYTorino, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0	0			1742-6588		*****************	WOS:000391490200100

These algorithms are in sharp contrast to complex network algorithms that necessitate all measurements to be sent to powerful central servers. In this work, at individual sensors, we employ Wald-statistic based detection algorithms which are computationally very fast, and are implemented as one of three Z-tests and four chi-square tests. At fusion center, we apply the K-out-of-N fusion to combine the sensors' hard decisions. We characterize the performance of detection methods by deriving analytical expressions for the distributions of underlying test statistics, and by analyzing the fusion performances in terms of K,N, and the false-alarm rates of individual detectors. We experimentally validate our methods using measurements from indoor and outdoor characterization tests of the Intelligence Radiation Sensors Systems (IRSS) program. In particular, utilizing the outdoor measurements, we construct two important real-life scenarios, boundary surveillance and portal monitoring, and present the results of our algorithms.					19th International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION)19th International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION)	JUL 05-08, 2016JUL 05-08, 2016	Robert Bosch GmbH; ATLAS ELEKTRONIK; RANDOM SETS LLC; Syst & Technol Res; Metron; Continental; AIRBUS; BECKHOFF; Springer; Int Soc Informat Fus; Intelligent Sensor Actuator Syst; Karlsruhe Inst Technol; Fraunhofer; VDE; COMO; Conf Catalysts LLC; IEEE, AESS SocRobert Bosch GmbH; ATLAS ELEKTRONIK; RANDOM SETS LLC; Syst & Technol Res; Metron; Continental; AIRBUS; BECKHOFF; Springer; Int Soc Informat Fus; Intelligent Sensor Actuator Syst; Karlsruhe Inst Technol; Fraunhofer; VDE; COMO; Conf Catalysts LLC; IEEE, AESS Soc	Heidelberg, GERMANYHeidelberg, GERMANY	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-9964-5274-8	WOS:000391273400110

The new paradigm is significantly different from the settings of traditional distributed algorithms [2], [3], [4], [5]: nodes are anonymous, the nodes do not need any knowledge of its neighbors, they receive binary message(s) from the neighbor(s), there is no need to decipher the message, only receipt or non-receipt of message(s) at any step of the algorithm. In this paper, we develop two new simple distributed algorithms to compute the minimal dominated set (MDS) and minimal total dominating set (MTDS) in a graph using this new paradigm. We show that the two algorithms for computing the MDS and MTDS respectively converge with probability (1 - 1/n(2)) using O(D log n) expected number of steps, where n is the number of nodes in the system and D is the maximum degree of a node. Preliminary experimental simulation results show that the algorithms converge in substantially less number of steps to converge than estimated by the analysis for a large number of graph families.					30th IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS)30th IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS)	MAY 23-27, 2016MAY 23-27, 2016	IEEE; IEEE Comp Soc, Tech Comm Parallel Proc; ACM SIGARCH; IEEE Comp Soc Tech Comm Comp Architecture; IEEE Comp Soc Tech Comm Distributed ProcIEEE; IEEE Comp Soc, Tech Comm Parallel Proc; ACM SIGARCH; IEEE Comp Soc Tech Comm Comp Architecture; IEEE Comp Soc Tech Comm Distributed Proc	Illinois Inst Technol, Chicago, ILIllinois Inst Technol, Chicago, IL	0	0	0	0	0	0			2164-7062		978-1-5090-3682-0	WOS:000391253600063

Consequently, they have been architected as net producers and not consumers of data. The Apache Hadoop ecosystem has evolved to meet the requirements of data processing applications and has addressed many of the traditional limitations of HPC platforms. There exist a class of scientific applications however, that need the collective capabilities of traditional high-performance computing environments and the Apache Hadoop ecosystem. For example, the scientific domains of bio-molecular dynamics, genomics and network science need to couple traditional computing with Hadoop/Spark based analysis. We investigate the critical question of how to present the capabilities of both computing environments to such scientific applications. Whereas this questions needs answers at multiple levels, we focus on the design of resource management middleware that might support the needs of both. We propose extensions to the Pilot-Abstraction so as to provide a unifying resource management layer. This is an important step towards interoperable use of HPC and Hadoop/Spark. It also allows applications to integrate HPC stages (e.g. simulations) to data analytics. Many supercomputing centers have started to officially support Hadoop environments, either in a dedicated environment or in hybrid deployments using tools such as myHadoop. This typically involves many intrinsic, environment-specific details that need to be mastered, and often swamp conceptual issues like: How best to couple HPC and Hadoop application stages? How to explore runtime trade-offs (data localities vs. data movement)? This paper provides both conceptual understanding and practical solutions to the integrated use of HPC and Hadoop environments. Our experiments are performed on state-of-the-art production HPC environments and provide middleware for multiple domain sciences.					30th IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS)30th IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS)	MAY 23-27, 2016MAY 23-27, 2016	IEEE; IEEE Comp Soc, Tech Comm Parallel Proc; ACM SIGARCH; IEEE Comp Soc Tech Comm Comp Architecture; IEEE Comp Soc Tech Comm Distributed ProcIEEE; IEEE Comp Soc, Tech Comm Parallel Proc; ACM SIGARCH; IEEE Comp Soc Tech Comm Comp Architecture; IEEE Comp Soc Tech Comm Distributed Proc	Illinois Inst Technol, Chicago, ILIllinois Inst Technol, Chicago, IL	0	0	0	0	0	0			2164-7062		978-1-5090-3682-0	WOS:000391253600198		
S	Liu, Jinwei; Shen, Haiying; Chen, Liuhua			IEEE					CORP: Cooperative Opportunistic Resource Provisioning for Short-Lived Jobs in Cloud Systems								2016 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CLUSTER COMPUTING (CLUSTER)		IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing						90	99					2016	2016	In cloud systems, achieving high resource utilization and low Service Level Objective (SLO) violation rate are important to the cloud provider for high profit. For this purpose, recently, some methods have been proposed to predict allocated but unused resources and reallocate them to long-running service jobs. However, the accuracy of their prediction method relies on the existence of patterns in jobs' resource utilization. Therefore, these methods cannot be used for short-lived jobs, which usually do not have certain patterns but exhibit frequent fluctuations in resource requirements. Also, these methods may result in resource fragmentation and lead to low resource utilization because they neglect job resource intensity in multi-resource allocation and may allocate much more resources to jobs. To handle this problem, we propose a Cooperative Opportunistic Resource Provisioning scheme (CORP) for short-lived jobs. CORP uses the deep learning method to predict the amount of temporarily-unused resource of each short-lived job. It also predicts the fluctuations of the amount of unused resource using Hidden Markov Model, and adjusts the predicted amount for the peak and valley of unused resource, and dynamically allocates the corrected amount of resource to jobs. Further, CORP uses a job packing strategy by leveraging complementary jobs' requirements on different resource types and allocates such jobs to the same VM to fully utilize unused resources, which increases resource utilization. Extensive experimental results based on a real cluster and Amazon EC2 show that CORP achieves high resource utilization and low SLO violation rate compared to previous resource provisioning schemes.

Many existing works on MapReduce scheduling decide the placement of map and reduce tasks on a coarse granularity of locations measured by located machines and racks. They do not explicitly consider the network topology and data transmission cost, which may cause task straggling and degrade the job performance. In order to improve MapReduce job performance, in this paper, we consider the task placement with the goal of minimizing the overall data transmission cost for a job execution while balancing the transmission cost reduction and resource utilization. We propose a probabilistic network-aware scheduling algorithm that selects a task (map task or reduce task) to be scheduled on a given available task slot that leads to the minimum transmission cost among the task candidates, and then schedule the selected task on the slot with a probability determined by its transmission cost; a lower expected transmission cost leads to a higher probability and vice versa. We also propose a method to more accurately estimate the intermediate data size based on the progress of map tasks, which is needed to calculate the transmission cost of reduce tasks but is unknown at the time of reduce task scheduling. We implement our probabilistic network-aware scheduling algorithm on Apache Hadoop and conduct experiments on a high-performance computing platform. The experimental results show that our scheduling algorithm outperforms the previous approaches in terms of job completion time and cluster resource utilization.

Previously, we worked with nurse educators in a participatory design process to create a scenario builder tool for SIDNIE [paper in submission].

Existing technology and non-technology based intervention programs do not provide assistance at the onset of abuse. The goal of our project is to create a mobile phone application that can detect digital dating abuse. To create the user-interface of this application, we are using a participatory design process. This paper describes the first two phases of this process. Focus group sessions were conducted to understand user requirements and generate hand drawn images to get users' visions of the application. Themes generated using thematic analysis concluded that the users wanted an application with an educational component, supported by a detection tool and a resource locator. A digital mockup of the phone app, with the themes generated and images drawn out by the participants, was then created.

Tandem pumping using 1018nm fiber lasers are used to enable both high brightness and low quantum defect. It is, however, difficult to realize efficient 1018nm YDFL. The best demonstration to date is limited by the use of both conventional aluminosilicate host and smaller core diameters. In these cases, higher inversion is required due to the aluminosilicate host and higher pump brightness is required due to the smaller core, which results in high signal brightness for the same output power. These factors lead to large pump power to exit fiber, resulting in poor efficiency. Phosphosilicate host, on the other hand, requires much lower inversions to reach the gain threshold at 1018nm. The combination of phosphosilicate host and large-core leakage channel fibers (LCF) is a perfect candidate for efficient 1018nm fiber laser.We report a highly efficient Yb-doped phosphosilicate LCF laser with a quantum defect of 4.1% using a similar to 50 mu m-core diameter and similar to 420 mu m cladding diameter. The slope efficiency with respect to the launched pump power at 1018nm is 70%. The ASE suppression is >60dB. The large cladding of 420 mu m demonstrates a combination of high efficiency, similar to 4% quantum defect and high-power low-brightness diode pumping. We have also studied the limits of operating ytterbium fiber lasers at shorter wavelengths and found the efficiency to fall off at shorter wavelengths due to the much higher inversions required.

We focus on proving the existence of an elliptic curve E/K with aliquot cycle (p(1),..., p(n)) where the pi are primes of K satisfying mild conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0035-7596	1945-3795		WOS:000392131800004

Resistance to FRAC codes 1, 2, 7, 9, 11, 12, and 17 are now common in strawberry fields of the east coast. Resistance is mostly due to an accumulation of point mutations in target genes over time, but other mechanisms, including the activity of drug efflux pumps exist. We discovered an increase of multifungicide resistance over three years of sampling that indicates more difficult control success in the future. An integrated approach is required to manage resistance.					11th International Rubus and Ribes Symposium11th International Rubus and Ribes Symposium	JUN 21-24, 2015JUN 21-24, 2015	Int Soc Hort SciInt Soc Hort Sci	Asheville, NCAsheville, NC	1	0	0	1	0	1			0567-7572		978-94-62611-15-3	WOS:000391239400077

LOCAL AND GLOBAL BERRY RESEARCH AND INNOVATION		Acta Horticulturae		117				1	5		10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1117.1			2016	2016	The complete genome sequences of apple, peach, and diploid strawberry - one member of each of the three main fruit-producing branches of the Rosaceae tree - were available in 2010. Despite this achievement, virtually none of this genomics knowledge was being used to assist breeding efforts of these crops. Four years later, this gap has been bridged, with genetic information routinely used in many US apple, peach, and cherry breeding programs. For example, DNA tests predict apple crispness, peach maturity date, and cherry fruit size, enabling breeders to determine the best parents to combine and the best seedlings to advance. This application significantly reduces the wasted effort to eliminate entirely poor families and reduces the costs to grow and evaluate thousands of seedlings genetically destined to have unacceptable fruit quality or maturity date. This achievement was enabled by international community efforts, including the RosBREED project, funded by the USDA-National Institute of Food and Agriculture Specialty Crop Research Initiative (SCRI). DNA tests are now applied for high-value attributes where the targeted loci explain a large proportion of the trait variation. However, limitations to widespread adoption of these predictive tests still exist. Some limitations are due to lack of knowledge, such as an understanding of genotype by environment (GxE) interactions and loci associated with variation for other valuable attributes. Technical limitations include streamlined phasing of alleles from multiple families of pedigree-connected breeding germplasm and access to suitable commercial service providers.					29th International Horticultural Congress on Horticulture - Sustaining Lives, Livelihoods and Landscapes (IHC) / 2nd International Berry Fruit Symposium - Interactions!

Field isolates have emerged and are now widespread in the eastern part of the United States being resistant to fungicides of multiple FRAC codes. They include FRAC 1, 2, 7, 9, 11, 12, and 17. In some cases isolates are resistant to compounds from up to 6 different FRAC codes and there are reports of emergence of 'superstrains', isolates that are resistant to compounds from all seven, single-site action FRAC codes registered for gray mold control. Resistance is mostly due to an accumulation of point mutations in target genes over time, but other mechanisms, such as those causing the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotypes MDR1 and MDR1h, exist. Management of these isolates under field conditions is challenging and will require an integrated approach.					29th International Horticultural Congress on Horticulture - Sustaining Lives, Livelihoods and Landscapes (IHC) / 2nd International Berry Fruit Symposium - Interactions!

Aerating shoots is necessary to prevent hyperhydricity and anoxia. Choosing a mechanical system for aeration involves increased cost, mechanical complexity and ergonomic problems, balanced against the anticipated improvements in growth responses. Larger vessels are used with these machines to increase the growth area serviced by the more complex mechanized devices. A wide variety of horticultural crops and mechanical devices will be shown to illustrate these points. Simple systems, such as stationary thin films and support matrices often yield quality growth without the complexities and costs of mechanized agitated liquids if interfacial transport properties of media and tissue are correctly incorporated. Mechanical rockers and pumped intermittent immersion systems increase the interfacial transfer surface that may further benefit growth. Two simple systems are demonstrated in this paper. A thin film system for Miscanthus x giganteus was shown to confer the advantages of both TIS and Rocker bioreactors. A novel vessel systems based on Oasis foam and a flexible film vessel was shown to combine stage III and acclimatization of Hydrangea, resulting in faster growing greenhouse plants. As better materials become available, simpler systems will also be more readily available.					29th International Horticultural Congress on Horticulture - Sustaining Lives, Livelihoods and Landscapes (IHC) / International Symposium on Micropropagation and In Vitro Techniques29th International Horticultural Congress on Horticulture - Sustaining Lives, Livelihoods and Landscapes (IHC) / International Symposium on Micropropagation and In Vitro Techniques	AUG 17-22, 2014AUG 17-22, 2014	Int Soc Hort SciInt Soc Hort Sci	Brisbane, AUSTRALIABrisbane, AUSTRALIA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-94-62611-07-8	WOS:000391238600005

After four weeks of culture, plantlets in flexible bags spent 1 week in a greenhouse mist bed to acclimatize the in vitro material to sunlight while rigid box treatments remained in the laboratory. After 5 weeks plants were potted in soilless mix and hand-watered as necessary. The plants from agar in box had the lowest survival compared to plants from the OASIS foam treatments (84 vs. 90-97%, respectively). Plants from the vented vessels had greater growth in the greenhouse than plants from non-vented vessels, with agar or OASIS foam (rigid boxes or sealed flexible bags). In vitro plantlets with larger crown diameter grew more quickly in the greenhouse, and when taken from vented vessels had the best greenhouse growth. Larger plants with crowns >30 mm produced in non-vented vessels did not demonstrate the faster growth observed in the vented treatments. After 6 weeks in the greenhouse, the largest plants originated from the vented vessels, and the smallest plants were from agar-cultured vessels. The Tissue Culture System that used OASIS foam in a vented flexible vessel, produced superior quality rooted plantlets because the root system was not disturbed during transfer. A second important benefit was that the acclimatization took place in the vented vessels on mist bed before transplant.					29th International Horticultural Congress on Horticulture - Sustaining Lives, Livelihoods and Landscapes (IHC) / International Symposium on Micropropagation and In Vitro Techniques29th International Horticultural Congress on Horticulture - Sustaining Lives, Livelihoods and Landscapes (IHC) / International Symposium on Micropropagation and In Vitro Techniques	AUG 17-22, 2014AUG 17-22, 2014	Int Soc Hort SciInt Soc Hort Sci	Brisbane, AUSTRALIABrisbane, AUSTRALIA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-94-62611-07-8	WOS:000391238600007

In vitro plants of turmeric were propagated in 35 different treatments of nutrient elements P (1.25-6.25 mM), Ca (3-9 mM), Mg (1.5-4.5 mM), KNO3 (20-60 mM) and plant density factors (6-18 buds per vessel), selected by D-optimal criteria and cultured over 5 months in intermittent-immersion rocker bioreactors, using mineral nutrients plus sucrose fed batch technique. Plants were transferred to greenhouse and grown for 6 months. Plants grown in high density (18 buds vessel(-1)) in vitro culture produced more new plants, had the highest relative fresh growth and the largest rhizome dry mass compared to low density (6 buds vessel(-1)) with similar concentrations of mineral in vitro. The plants grown in vitro with moderate KNO3 (37.7 mM) produced 8 0.9 new plants stock plant(-1) in greenhouse. Moderate P (3.5-4 mM) and Ca (5.7-6 mM), lowest Mg (1.5 mM), and highest KNO3 (60 mM) showed greatest mass increase (26.6 +/- 2.3 fold stock plant(-1)) and greatest rhizome production (50.7 +/- 2.8 g dry mass stock plant(-1)) in greenhouse. Secondary rhizomes were observed in all treatments. A multifactor design in vitro resolved combined effects of plant density and several elements during subsequent growth in one greenhouse experiment. High in vitro plant density combined with proper mineral nutrition yielded more plants that continue to grow better during a season of greenhouse growth. Optimization for propagation stock has a different nutrient mixture than optimization for biomass and rhizomes.					29th International Horticultural Congress on Horticulture - Sustaining Lives, Livelihoods and Landscapes (IHC) / International Symposium on Micropropagation and In Vitro Techniques29th International Horticultural Congress on Horticulture - Sustaining Lives, Livelihoods and Landscapes (IHC) / International Symposium on Micropropagation and In Vitro Techniques	AUG 17-22, 2014AUG 17-22, 2014	Int Soc Hort SciInt Soc Hort Sci	Brisbane, AUSTRALIABrisbane, AUSTRALIA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-94-62611-07-8	WOS:000391238600008

Therefore, breeding for resistance to both pathogens is essential for the chestnut sustainability in Europe and the United States of America. Several genomic approaches have been implemented in order to map the resistance first to ink disease and then to blight chestnut using a hybrid population: C. sativa crossed with resistant Asian species (C. crenata and C. mollissima). The transcriptome of C. sativa and C. crenata inoculated and not with P. cinnamomi was recently sequenced and allowed the identification of genes putatively involved in ink disease resistance. Taking advantage of molecular markers (microsatellite and SNPs), developed from the referred tanscriptomes and from C. mollissima transcriptome, the first C. sativa x C. crenata genetic map was constructed. Additionally, a reliable phenotyping method was established to evaluate the level of P. cinnamomi resistance of each hybrid allowing the identification of two Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs). These results are the first step for understanding the resistance to ink disease in chestnut.		A tinta e o cancro do castanheiro, causadas respetivamente pelo oomiceta Phytophthora cinnamomi e pelo fungo Cryphonectria parasitica, são as doenças que mais severamente afetam o castanheiro europeu (Castanea sativa) e americano (C. dentata). Assim, o melhoramento para resistência a estes dois agentes patogénicos é essencial para a sustentabilidade do castanheiro na Europa e nos Estados Unidos da América. Diversas abordagens genómicas foram implementadas com o objetivo de mapear a resistência à tinta, e posteriormente ao cancro, usando uma população híbrida: C. sativa cruzada com espécies asiáticas resistentes (C. crenata e C. mollissima). Foi recentemente sequenciado o transcritoma de C. sativa e C. crenata com ou sem inoculação com P. cinnamomi, permitindo a identificação de genes potencialmente envolvidos na resistência à tinta. O primeiro mapa genético de C. sativa x C. crenata foi construído a partir de marcadores moleculares (microsatélites e SNPs) desenvolvidos a partir daqueles transcritomas bem como do transcritoma de C. mollissima.

Penetration resistance and ballistic-impact behavior of Ti/TiAl3 metal/intermetallic laminated composites (MILCs): A computational investigation								AIMS MATERIALS SCIENCE				3	3			686	721		10.3934/matersci.2016.3.686			2016	2016	A comprehensive computational engineering analysis is carried out in order to assess suitability of the Ti/TiAl3 metal/intermetallic laminated composites (MILCs) for use in both structural and add-on armor applications. This class of composite materials consists of alternating sub-millimeter thick layers of Ti (the ductile and tough constituent) and TiAl3 (the stiff and hard constituent). In recent years, this class of materials has been investigated for potential use in light-armor applications as a replacement for the traditional metallic or polymer-matrix composite materials. Within the computational analysis, an account is given to differing functional requirements for candidate materials when used in structural and add-on ballistic armor. The analysis employed is of a transient, nonlinear-dynamics, finite-element character, and the problem investigated involves normal impact (i.e. under zero obliquity angle) of a Ti/TiAl3 MILC target plate, over a range of incident velocities, by a fragment simulating projectile (FSP). This type of analysis can provide more direct information regarding the ballistic limit of the subject armor material, as well as help with the identification of the nature and the efficacy of various FSP material-deformation/erosion and kineticenergy absorption/dissipation phenomena and processes. The results obtained clearly revealed that Ti/TiAl3 MILCs are more suitable for use in add-on ballistic, than in structural armor applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2372-0468	2372-0484		WOS:000390882300001		
J	Grujicic, Mica; Ramaswami, S.; Snipes, Jennifer S.								Use of the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) approach in the design of improved-performance fiber-reinforced SiC/SiC ceramic-matrix composites (CMCs)								AIMS MATERIALS SCIENCE				3	3			989	1021		10.3934/matersci.2016.3.989			2016	2016	New materials are traditionally developed using costly and time-consuming trial-and-error experimental efforts. This is followed by an even lengthier material-certification process. Consequently, it takes 10 to 20 years before a newly-discovered material is commercially employed. An alternative approach to the development of new materials is the so-called materials-by-design approach within which a material is treated as a complex hierarchical system, and its design and optimization is carried out by employing computer-aided engineering analyses, predictive tools and available material databases. In the present work, the materials-by-design approach is utilized to design a grade of fiber-reinforced (FR) SiC/SiC ceramic matrix composites (CMCs), the type of materials which are currently being used in stationary components, and are considered for use in rotating components, of the hot sections of gas-turbine engines. Towards that end, a number of mathematical functions and numerical models are developed which relate CMC constituents' (fibers, fiber coating and matrix) microstructure and their properties to the properties and performance of the CMC as a whole. To validate the newly-developed materials-by-design approach, comparisons are made between experimentally measured and computationally predicted selected CMC mechanical properties. Then an optimization procedure is employed to determine the chemical makeup and processing routes for the CMC constituents so that the selected mechanical properties of the CMCs are increased to a preset target level.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2372-0468	2372-0484		WOS:000390882300018

Confirmatory factor analysis of the Parental Academic Support Scale (PASS) revealed a close model fit and replicated prior confirmatory factor analysis tests, and ultimately provided additional evidence for content validity. Correlations between parental academic support and the Teacher-Parent Contact Scale provided concurrent validity evidence. More importantly, associations between parental academic support and a child's success in school suggest that the PASS construct is related to other theoretically similar constructs, providing initial evidence for construct validity. Implications and recommendations for future research are discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0363-4523	1479-5795		WOS:000391033400006

Parametric vehicle mass estimation for optimisation								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF VEHICLE DESIGN				72	1			1	16		10.1504/IJVD.2016.079202			2016	2016	In order to perform optimisation of parametric vehicle designs in the conceptual design phase of vehicle development, before detailed design information and styling are defined, it is necessary to estimate the mass of significant vehicle subsystems and the resulting total vehicle curb mass as accurately as possible. This work develops estimation relationships for a number of subsystems and assesses the resulting correlations to actual vehicle subsystem and curb mass data. The mass estimation relationships have been intentionally developed using a minimal set of vehicle parameters (overall length, width, height, wheelbase and engine power) to simplify the process and increase the speed of optimisation iterations. Several of the subsystem estimations can also be used in determining vehicle centre of gravity location. Separate mass relationships for steel and aluminium have been developed for Body in White and closure mass estimation. Additional mass relationships for hybrid vehicles will be included in future work.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0143-3369	1741-5314		WOS:000391087600001

As a result, older, treated rootstocks contain enough stored energy to allow improved grafting success in a shorter period of time. An overview of three experiments will be presented to describe this novel approach to cucurbit grafting. First, a rate trial was conducted to determine the optimal concentration of fatty alcohol for rootstock treatment. Nine rates (0.00, 3.75, 5.00, 6.25, 7.50, 8.75, 10.00, 12.50, and 15.00%) of two commercial fatty alcohol products ( Fair 85 and Off-Shoot T) were applied to interspecific hybrid and Lagenaria rootstock types. Damage and regrowth incidences were recorded, and 6.25% was found to be the optimal treatment concentration. The second experiment analyzed rootstock hypocotyl carbohydrate content at 1, 7, 14, and 21 days after fatty alcohol treatment. In interspecific hybrid rootstock hypocotyls, total soluble sugar increased significantly over 14 days after treatment, and starch levels significantly increased over 21 days after treatment. In Lagenaria rootstock hypocotyls, total soluble sugars increased significantly over 14 days after treatment. In the final experiment, the two rootstocks were grafted at 1, 7, 14, and 21 days after fatty alcohol treatment to determine the effect of fatty alcohol treatment on rootstock grafting success and the optimal grafting time after fatty alcohol treatment. Interspecific hybrid squash and Lagenaria type rootstocks showed increased graft survival at 7 and 14 days, respectively, after grafting with the onecotyledon graft method. At 7 and 14 days after treatment, grafting with the new hypocotyl only method was successful in interspecific hybrid squash and Lagenaria rootstocks, respectively.					29th International Horticultural Congress on Horticulture - Sustaining Lives, Livelihoods and Landscapes (IHC) / International Symposium on High Value Vegetables, Root and Tuber Crops, and Edible Fungi Production, Supply and Demands29th International Horticultural Congress on Horticulture - Sustaining Lives, Livelihoods and Landscapes (IHC) / International Symposium on High Value Vegetables, Root and Tuber Crops, and Edible Fungi Production, Supply and Demands	AUG 17-22, 2014AUG 17-22, 2014	Int Soc Hort SciInt Soc Hort Sci	Brisbane, AUSTRALIABrisbane, AUSTRALIA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-94-62611-27-6	WOS:000391239300004

S	Chen, Kang; Shen, Haiying			IEEE					RoadAware: Learning Personalized Road Information on Daily Routes with Smartphones								2016 25TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKS (ICCCN)		IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks												2016	2016	In this paper, we introduce RoadAware, an infrastructure-less system that leverages a smartphone to collect road information on people's daily routes to and from work. Unlike previous research that utilizes moving vehicles equipped with sensors to collect road information, RoadAware does not need the support from infrastructure, road-side facilities or other users and focuses on serving individuals during his/her daily commute to and back from work. RoadAware can provide road information including 1) travel distance and time between traffic lights; 2) duration of red and green signals of each traffic light; and 3) traffic volume on the road between traffic lights. RoadAware builds a model that can deduce the road information based on the wait time and the length of the waiting queue in front of the car when it stops at a traffic light. The road information not only benefits individuals in their daily commutes (e.g., predict waiting at red lights and remind whether there is a delay on daily route) but can also be collected for traffic optimization that otherwise requires costly sensor deployment. We developed RoadAware on Windows smartphones, and our extensive real-world test shows that RoadAware can provide road information with acceptable accuracy.					25th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)25th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)	AUG 01-04, 2016AUG 01-04, 2016	IEEE; IEEE Commun SocIEEE; IEEE Commun Soc	Waikoloa, HIWaikoloa, HI	0	0	0	0	0	0			1095-2055		978-1-5090-2279-3	WOS:000389589500083

We give an algorithm based on minimal hitting set to learn the exact underlying graph structure and provide sufficient condition on number of cascades required (i.e. sample complexity) for reliable recovery, which is shown to be O(logn), where n is the number of nodes in the graph. We then analytically evaluate performance of minimal hitting set approach in learning the degree distribution and detecting leaf nodes of a graph and provide a sufficient condition for its sample complexity which is shown to be lower than that of learning the whole graph. We also generalize the exact graph estimation problem to the problem of estimating the graph within a certain distortion, measured by edit distance. We show that this edit distance based graph estimator has a lower sample complexity. Our experimental results based on both synthetic network topologies and a real-world network trace show that our algorithm achieves superior performance than a previously proposed algorithm based on maximum likelihood.					25th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)25th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)	AUG 01-04, 2016AUG 01-04, 2016	IEEE; IEEE Commun SocIEEE; IEEE Commun Soc	Waikoloa, HIWaikoloa, HI	0	0	0	0	0	0			1095-2055		978-1-5090-2279-3	WOS:000389589500059		
S	Liu, Jinwei; Shen, Haiying; Zhang, Xiang			IEEE					A Survey of Mobile Crowdsensing Techniques: A Critical Component for The Internet of Things								2016 25TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKS (ICCCN)		IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks												2016	2016	Mobile crowdsensing serves as a critical building block for the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, the sensing devices continuously generate a large amount of data, which consumes much resources (e.g., bandwidth, energy and storage), and may sacrifice the quality-of-service (QoS) of applications. Prior work has demonstrated that there is significant redundancy in the content of the sensed data. By judiciously reducing the redundant data, the data size and the load can be significantly reduced, thereby reducing resource cost, facilitating the timely delivery of unique, probably critical information and enhancing QoS. This paper presents a survey of existing works for the mobile crowdsensing strategies with emphasis on reducing the resource cost and achieving high QoS. We start by introducing the motivation for this survey, and present the necessary background of crowdsensing and IoT. We then present various mobile crowdsensing strategies and discuss their strengths and limitations. Finally, we discuss the future research directions for mobile crowdsensing. The survey addresses a broad range of techniques, methods, models, systems and applications related to mobile crowdsensing and IoT. Our goal is not only to analyze and compare the strategies proposed in the prior works but also to discuss their applicability towards the IoT, and provide the guidance on the future research direction of mobile crowdsensing.					25th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)25th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)	AUG 01-04, 2016AUG 01-04, 2016	IEEE; IEEE Commun SocIEEE; IEEE Commun Soc	Waikoloa, HIWaikoloa, HI	0	0	0	0	0	0			1095-2055		978-1-5090-2279-3	WOS:000389589500012

In this paper, we study the link scheduling problem in wireless cooperative communication networks, in which receivers are allowed to combine copies of a message to combat fading. We formulate two problems named cooperative link scheduling problem (CLS) and one-shot cooperative link scheduling problem (OCLS). The first problem aims to find a schedule of links that uses the minimum number of time slots to inform all the receivers. The second problem aims to find a set of links that can inform the maximum number of receivers in one time slot. As a solution, we propose an algorithm for both CLS and OCLS with g(K) approximation ratio, where g(K) is so called diversity of key links. In addition, we propose a greedy algorithm with O(1) approximation ratio for OCLS when the number of links for each receiver is upper bounded by a constant. Simulation results indicate that our cooperative link scheduling approaches outperform non-cooperative ones.					25th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)25th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)	AUG 01-04, 2016AUG 01-04, 2016	IEEE; IEEE Commun SocIEEE; IEEE Commun Soc	Waikoloa, HIWaikoloa, HI	0	0	0	0	0	0			1095-2055		978-1-5090-2279-3	WOS:000389589500062

In addition, a SH is able to transact power with the local distribution company (DISCO) through the grid. This study intends to investigate the energy scheduling problem of a SH so that the daily electricity consumption cost of the SH is minimized. Herein, the challenges include modeling the economic and technical constraints of the DG and the battery of the PEV, and also dealing with the variability and uncertainties concerned with the power of the PV panels that make the problem a nonlinear, dynamic (time-varying), and stochastic optimization problem. In order to handle the variability and uncertainties of the power of the PV panels, a stochastic model predictive control (MPC) is applied. Herein, a combination of genetic algorithm (GA) and linear programming (GA-LP) approach is applied as the optimization tool. The numerical study demonstrates the competence of the proposed approach for decreasing the operation cost.					25th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)25th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)	AUG 01-04, 2016AUG 01-04, 2016	IEEE; IEEE Commun SocIEEE; IEEE Commun Soc	Waikoloa, HIWaikoloa, HI	0	0	0	0	0	0			1095-2055		978-1-5090-2279-3	WOS:000389589500039

It is dedicated to the observation of the Universe with unprecedented sensitivity in the energy range 0.2 - 100 MeV, extending up to GeV energies, together with a groundbreaking polarization capability. It is designed to substantially improve the COMPTEL and Fermi sensitivities in the MeV-GeV energy range and to open new windows of opportunity for astrophysical and fundamental physics space research. e-ASTROGAM will operate as an open astronomical observatory, with a core science focused on (1) the activity from extreme particle accelerators, including gamma-ray bursts and active galactic nuclei and the link of jet astrophysics to the new astronomy of gravitational waves, neutrinos, ultra-high energy cosmic rays, (2) the high-energy mysteries of the Galactic center and inner Galaxy, including the activity of the supermassive black hole, the Fermi Bubbles, the origin of the Galactic positrons, and the search for dark matter signatures in a new energy window; (3) nucleosynthesis and chemical evolution, including the life cycle of elements produced by supernovae in the Milky Way and the Local Group of galaxies. e-ASTROGAM will be ideal for the study of high-energy sources in general, including pulsars and pulsar wind nebulae, accreting neutron stars and black holes, novae, supernova remnants, and magnetars. And it will also provide important contributions to solar and terrestrial physics. The e-ASTROGAM telescope is optimized for the simultaneous detection of Compton and pair-producing gamma-ray events over a large spectral band. It is based on a very high technology readiness level for all subsystems and includes many innovative features for the detectors and associated electronics.

Thanks to the unprecedented combination of effective area and spectral resolution of its main instrument and the uniquely large field of view of its wide field monitor, LOFT will be able to study the behaviour of matter in extreme conditions such as the strong gravitational field in the innermost regions close to black holes and neutron stars and the supra-nuclear densities in the interiors of neutron stars. The science payload is based on a Large Area Detector (LAD, > 8m(2) effective area, 2-30 keV, 240 eV spectral resolution, 1 degree collimated field of view) and a Wide Field Monitor (WFM, 2-50 keV, 4 steradian field of view, 1 arcmin source location accuracy, 300 eV spectral resolution). The WFM is equipped with an on-board system for bright events (e. g., GRB) localization. The trigger time and position of these events are broadcast to the ground within 30 s from discovery. In this paper we present the current technical and programmatic status of the mission.

At the time of writing XIPE is in a competitive phase A as fourth medium size mission of ESA (M4). It promises to reopen the polarimetry window in high energy Astrophysics after more than 4 decades thanks to a detector that efficiently exploits the photoelectric effect and to X-ray optics with large effective area. XIPE uniqueness is time-spectrally-spatially- resolved X-ray polarimetry as a breakthrough in high energy astrophysics and fundamental physics. Indeed the payload consists of three Gas Pixel Detectors at the focus of three X-ray optics with a total effective area larger than one XMM mirror but with a low weight. The payload is compatible with the fairing of the Vega launcher. XIPE is designed as an observatory for X- ray astronomers with 75% of the time dedicated to a Guest Observer competitive program and it is organized as a consortium across Europe with main contributions from Italy, Germany, Spain, United Kingdom, Poland, Sweden.

J	Chen, Kang; Izard, Ryan; Hu, Hongxin; Wang, Kuang-Ching; Martin, James; Deng, Juan			IEEE					HetSDN: Exploiting SDN for Intelligent Network Usage in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks								2016 IEEE/ACM 24TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON QUALITY OF SERVICE (IWQOS)														2016	2016	Mobile devices nowadays can find multiple wireless networks, such as WiFi, 4G/LTE and relay through devices. These networks have different characteristics in terms of coverage, data rate, and price. Meanwhile, mobile applications (and even different TCP/UDP connections) often have diverse and time-variant network needs. Thus, to better use all wireless network resources, it would be ideal to enable a TCP/UDP connection to 1) select the most appropriate network dynamically and 2) migrate between networks transparently. However, existing methods fail to provide both functions in a systematic and efficient way at the TCP/UDP connection level. In this paper, we adopt Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to realize such a feature. We use the features of SDN to realize intelligent network selection that is adaptive to time-variant application needs, network availability, and scheduling commands. To support transparent migration, an intelligent home agent (HA) is designed with the SDN to anchor packets from the mobile device. It can intelligently determine which wireless network a TCP/UDP connection is running over. Finally, our implementation demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed system.					24th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Quality of Service (IWQoS)24th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Quality of Service (IWQoS)	JUN 20-21, 2016JUN 20-21, 2016	IEEE; ACMIEEE; ACM	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINABeijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0					*****************	WOS:000389832500037

In contrast to previous approaches restricted to three Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) joysticks, a six degree-of-freedom rigid-link manipulator is used as the input device. Mappings from the rigid-link arm to the continuum robot are synthesized and analyzed, focusing on their potential for creating a more intuitive operational interface. The approach was implemented using a six degree-of-freedom rigid-link manipulator as input device for teleoperation of a three section, nine degree-of-freedom continuum robot. Tests were conducted across a range of planar and spatial tasks, using fifteen participant operators. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, and suggest that it can be effective independent of the prior robotics, gaming, or teleoperative experience of the operator.

In this paper, a new method based on the principle of virtual work and a geometry deformation approach is presented for the inverse kinematics model of the STIFF-FLOP arm which is a pneumatically actuated continuum manipulator. We propose a novel simplified and computationally efficient yet accurate analytical solution to analyse the static behaviour of a compound soft manipulator in the presence of external and body forces which is verified against experimental data, showing promising agreement with 10% mean error for planar movements. In the process, we present a new modelling approach for braided soft extensor actuators with no braid-surface relative slip constraint. For the first time, our model predicts a simple analytical solution for the cross section deformation which is essential to control soft manipulators with regional tunable stiffness structure.

This case study investigates the specific challenges that a large educational institution in the United States is having in terms of determining facility information for use during facility operations and management. The current process is tedious, time consuming, and error-prone, leading to information that is often inconsistent or incomplete. Process improvements utilizing industry standards and BIM are being examined and evaluated to determine which may be the best options for the University with the end goal being developed BIM guidelines and a Facility Information Management Guide that best fits the University's needs. The paper summarizes BIM-FM requirements of other large owners and how some experienced contractors have helped to overcome common challenges. The specific challenges related to the University and potential methods for overcoming those challenges are also presented. Lastly, a strategy to pilot test the process improvements is discussed with future strategies for successful adoption.

J	Liu, Guoxin; Shen, Haiying			IEEE					An Economical and SLO-Guaranteed Cloud Storage Service across Multiple Cloud Service Providers								IEEE INFOCOM 2016 - THE 35TH ANNUAL IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS														2016	2016	It is important for cloud service brokers to provide a multi-cloud storage service to minimize their payment cost to cloud service providers (CSPs) while providing service level objective (SLO) guarantee to their customers. Many multi-cloud storage services have been proposed or payment cost minimization or SLO guarantee. However, no previous works fully leverage the current cloud pricing policies (such as resource reservation pricing) to reduce the payment cost. Also, few works achieve both cost minimization and SLO guarantee. In this paper, we propose a multi-cloud Economical and SLO-guaranteed Storage Service (ES3), which determines data allocation and resource reservation schedules with payment cost minimization and SLO guarantee. ES3 incorporates (1) a coordinated data allocation and resource reservation method, which allocates each data item to a datacenter and determines the resource reservation amount on datacenters by leveraging all the pricing policies; (2) a genetic algorithm based data allocation adjustment method, which reduce data Get/Put rate variance in each datacenter to maximize the reservation benefit; and (3) a dynamic request redirection method, which dynamically redirects a data request from a reservation-overutilized datacenter to a reservation-underutilized datacenter to further reduce the payment. Our trace-driven experiments on a supercomputing cluster and on real clouds (i.e., Amazon S3, Windows Azure Storage and Google Cloud Storage) show the superior performance of ES3 in payment cost minimization and SLO guarantee in comparison with previous methods.					35th IEEE Annual International Conference on Computer Communications (IEEE INFOCOM)35th IEEE Annual International Conference on Computer Communications (IEEE INFOCOM)	APR 10-14, 2016APR 10-14, 2016	IEEEIEEE	San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4673-9953-1	WOS:000390154400300		
J	Qiu, Chenxi; Shen, Haiying; Chen, Liuhua			IEEE					Probabilistic Demand Allocation for Cloud Service Brokerage								IEEE INFOCOM 2016 - THE 35TH ANNUAL IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS														2016	2016	Functioning as an intermediary between cloud tenants and providers, cloud service brokerages (CSBs) bring about great benefits to the cloud market. To maximize its own profit, a CSB is faced with a challenge: how to reserve servers and distribute tenant demands to the reserved servers such that the total reservation cost is minimized while the reserved servers can satisfy the tenant service level agreement (SLA)? Demand prediction and demand allocation are two steps to solve this problem. However, previous demand prediction methods cannot accurately predict tenant demands since they cannot accurately estimate prediction errors and also assume the existence of seasonal periods of demands. Previous demand allocation methods only aim to minimize the number of reserved servers rather than the server reservation cost, which is more challenging. To solve this challenge, we propose a Probabilistic Demand Allocation system (PDA). It predicts demands and more accurate prediction errors without the assumption of the existence of seasonal periods. It then formulates a nonlinear programming problem and has a decentralized method to find the problem solution. In addition to overcoming the shortcomings in previous methods, PDA is novel in that rather than separately conducting the prediction and demand allocation, it considers prediction errors in demand allocation in order to allocate demands with offsetting prediction errors (e.g., -1 and +1) to the same server, which helps find the problem solution. Both simulation and real-world experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our system in reducing servers' reservation cost.					35th IEEE Annual International Conference on Computer Communications (IEEE INFOCOM)35th IEEE Annual International Conference on Computer Communications (IEEE INFOCOM)	APR 10-14, 2016APR 10-14, 2016	IEEEIEEE	San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4673-9953-1	WOS:000390154400282

Yet organizations require temporary leaders during leadership gaps but there is limited information on serving in an acting role or for a short period of time. Serving as an interim leader has unique challenges and opportunities but several considerations should be made to make this a positive experience providing smooth transitions for an organization.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0193-0826	1540-3564		WOS:000389926900007

The use of MPTCP has been recently explored to support heterogeneous wireless networks (HetNets) involving hosts that have multiple network interfaces. However, current solutions generally involve many simplifying assumptions. In this paper, we propose a new framework to collect scheduling information from various scheduling network entities and conduct optimization from a global view. The framework uses the existing or readily accessible MPTCP parameters. Under this framework, we introduce a centralized optimization algorithm to realize general proportional fairness of user throughput. Based on results from NS3 simulations, we provide evidence that the approach provides a low cost solution for improved performance from the perspectives of both applications and network operators.					14th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks (WiOpt)14th International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks (WiOpt)	MAY 09-13, 2016MAY 09-13, 2016		Tempe, AZTempe, AZ	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-5090-1311-1	WOS:000389647700034

While much has been learned in the development of the large mode area (LMA) designs, these fibers are highly complex and very difficult to manufacture; factors that conspire to make it difficult to achieve its system bandwidth and power goals. All of these parasitic effects fundamentally originate from the light's interaction with the material from which the fibers are made. Accordingly, a materials-related approach directly attacks the underlying physical origins of these nonlinearities. This paper will discuss simple core/clad optical fibers made from novel glasses that mitigate these performance limiting nonlinearities.					18th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)18th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)	JUL 10-14, 2016JUL 10-14, 2016	IEEE Photon SocIEEE Photon Soc	Univ Trento, Fac Letters & Philosophy, Trento, ITALYUniv Trento, Fac Letters & Philosophy, Trento, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0	0			2162-7339		978-1-5090-1467-5	WOS:000389537400456

In this study, in order to minimize charging cost of the plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), conventional grid-supplied PEVs parking lots are proposed to be canopied with PV panels, since parking lots occupy a considerable surface of a city. Also, the solar parking lots can cool down PEVs, charge their batteries, and even deliver excess energy to the grid. In this paper, value of the net benefit due to equipping a solar parking lot with PV panels are investigated over the life time of the PV panels with and without presence an energy storage. Herein, the cost and income terms include investment cost for purchasing the PV panels, investment cost for purchasing a battery, and benefit due to charging the PEVs with free energy generated by the PV panels. Moreover, the problem is simulated from different staring years considering the real prices of the PV panels and battery. In addition, the cost-to-benefit transition year is determined in every simulation.					21th Electrical Power Distribution Network Conference (EPDC)21th Electrical Power Distribution Network Conference (EPDC)	APR 26-28, 2016APR 26-28, 2016		Karaj, IRANKaraj, IRAN	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4673-9066-8	WOS:000389511900001

As a result of growing dependence, the availability of these systems has become a concern. This concern increases exponentially when considering systems such as smart power grids and public utility services. Therefore, research should be conducted to develop effective ways of detecting system anomalies. Denial of Service attacks are an important problem for the communication systems. Researchers proposed many DDoS detection approaches. In this study, we propose a novel DDoS detection approach: Cusum - Entropy. Our approach performs additional signal processing on the entropy of the packet header field to improve detection efficiency. We tested our approach using operational network traffic and performing DDoS attacks without jeopardizing the operation network. Our results showed that our approach gives high detection and low false positive rates and outperforms the detection approach using the entropy of packet header field.					4th International Istanbul Smart Grid Congress and Fair (ICSG)4th International Istanbul Smart Grid Congress and Fair (ICSG)	APR 20-21, 2016APR 20-21, 2016	Republ Turkey, Minist EU Affairs; Turkiye Cumhuriyeti Kultur Turizm Bakanligi; KOSGEB; TEDAS; TEIAS; Istanbul Buyuksehir Belediyesi; Turkish Electro Technol; Energy Business Council, Foreign Econ Relat Board; Istanbul Kanalizasyon Idaresi; BOTAS; IGDAS Gokyuzuyle Arkadas; Istanbul Ticaret Odasi; Istabul Sanayi Odasi; UHE; UFI; Elder; GAZBIR; TENVA; Turk Sanayici Isadamlari VAKFI; Organize Sanayi Bolgeleri Dernegi; Teknoloji Ar Ge Bilim Inouasyon Dernegi; TURKCELL; Vodafone; LUNA; STATUEAZ; SABAH; HITACHI; KOHLER; ORACLE; aselsan; ERICSSON; NETAS; SIEMENS; Microsoft; best; HHB EXPO; Republ Turkey, Minist Sci Ind & Technol; Republ Turkey, Minist Environm & Urbanisat; Republ Turkey, Minist Energy & Nat Resources; EPDK, Republ Turkey; Istanbul Metropolitan Municipal; Ugetam; IEEE SMARTGRID; IEEE Power & Energy SocRepubl Turkey, Minist EU Affairs; Turkiye Cumhuriyeti Kultur Turizm Bakanligi; KOSGEB; TEDAS; TEIAS; Istanbul Buyuksehir Belediyesi; Turkish Electro Technol; Energy Business Council, Foreign Econ Relat Board; Istanbul Kanalizasyon Idaresi; BOTAS; IGDAS Gokyuzuyle Arkadas; Istanbul Ticaret Odasi; Istabul Sanayi Odasi; UHE; UFI; Elder; GAZBIR; TENVA; Turk Sanayici Isadamlari VAKFI; Organize Sanayi Bolgeleri Dernegi; Teknoloji Ar Ge Bilim Inouasyon Dernegi; TURKCELL; Vodafone; LUNA; STATUEAZ; SABAH; HITACHI; KOHLER; ORACLE; aselsan; ERICSSON; NETAS; SIEMENS; Microsoft; best; HHB EXPO; Republ Turkey, Minist Sci Ind & Technol; Republ Turkey, Minist Environm & Urbanisat; Republ Turkey, Minist Energy & Nat Resources; EPDK, Republ Turkey; Istanbul Metropolitan Municipal; Ugetam; IEEE SMARTGRID; IEEE Power & Energy Soc	Istanbul, TURKEYIstanbul, TURKEY	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-5090-0866-7	WOS:000389660400016

Interface design promotes equal distance between PIN numerals, leading to a circular layout resulting in the choice of a rotary telephone dial metaphor. The rotary's speed advantage over the traditional grid-based (e.g., keypad) design is derived from its elimination of dwell time for gaze-based numeral selection, relying instead on a weighted voting scheme of numerals whose boundaries are crossed by the streaming (smoothed) gaze points. Screen center-bias is exploited by requiring users to transition to and from the center to the rotary numerals, in order to enter in the PIN code sequence. Compared with the keypad layout, empirical results show that PIN digit entry errors do not differ significantly between interfaces, although the rotary incurs fewer errors overall. Expressing preference for the rotary, users appeared to quickly grasp its operation.					9th Biennial ACM Symposium on Eye Tracking Research and Applications (ETRA)9th Biennial ACM Symposium on Eye Tracking Research and Applications (ETRA)	MAR 14-17, 2016MAR 14-17, 2016	ACM; ACM SIGGRAPH; ACM SIGCHIACM; ACM SIGGRAPH; ACM SIGCHI	Charleston, SCCharleston, SC	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4503-4125-7	WOS:000389809700009

Hidden Markov models (HMMs) were developed to capture variations in motion patterns of subgroups of participants. Specifically, we examined if foreknowledge of the gender, age, and utensil used for eating could improve recognition accuracy. Improvement in accuracy was measured by comparing to a baseline HMM that was trained on all participants. Data was collected for 276 participants eating a single meal within a cafeteria setting. A total of 44,873 gestures were manually labeled using video synchronized with the wrist motion tracking device. Results show that gender HMMs performed slightly better than the baseline, indicating that there is not much difference in wrist motion patterns during eating between females and males. Age HMMs provided a 4.3% increase in accuracy and utensil HMMs provided a 6.2% increase in accuracy. The results suggest that contextual variables can be used for improving gesture recognition.					1st IEEE International Conference on Connected Health - Applications, Systems and Engineering Technologies (CHASE)1st IEEE International Conference on Connected Health - Applications, Systems and Engineering Technologies (CHASE)	JUN 27-29, 2016JUN 27-29, 2016	IEEE; IEEE Comp SocIEEE; IEEE Comp Soc	Washington, DCWashington, DC	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-5090-0943-5	WOS:000389604100036

Why has collaboration between IS academics increased? While prior research on the incidence of co-authorship provides several reasons for why academics collaborate, little is known about whether these rationales are equally adept at explaining the growing extent of co-authorship. To answer this question, we delve into extant research on collaboration and delineate four rationales for why papers have more co-authors. These include information processing, access to social resources, convenience, and the opportunity cost of time. We formulate several variables and propose several hypotheses based on these rationales. We collected data by coding 641 papers from six major U.S. and European journals. The results generally support the proposed hypotheses. We discuss the implications of the results in terms of how they inform the field and policy makers.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1529-3181			WOS:000389639400003		
J	Grover, Varun; London, Jackie; Craig, Kevin								A Historical Observation of the Intellectual and Institutional Structures of the Field								COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS				38				432	476	25				2016	2016	In this paper, we examine the evolution of the institutional and intellectual structures of the IS field. We argue that, though the field's institutional structures-academic programs, journals, conferences, and professional associations-have developed admirably, the state of the field's intellectual structure is less clear. We employ a co-citation lens to analyze the development and evolution of subfields across three periods. We rely on Culnan's (1987) second co-citation study as a point of departure for our analysis. We then extend her work through two additional studies that individually assess the state of subfield development at distinct periods during the field's history. Over the three periods, we note that the field has experienced change in subfield diversity and cohesion. Culnan's study exhibits low levels of cohesion and diversity among topics. Our first study shows continued isolation but growth in subfield diversity. This period is indicative of a fragmented adhocracy. Our second study suggests increasing levels of integration despite only a slight reduction in subfield diversity. While we largely only describe the field's evolution, any assessment of whether this evolution represents a positive or negative trajectory for the field will be subject to interpretation and debate.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1529-3181			WOS:000389639400025

An Examination of the Differential Effects of the Modern Epidemiological Transition on Cranial Morphology in the United States and Portugal								HUMAN BIOLOGY				88	1			30	37					JAN 2016	2016	This research examines the pattern of secular change in the cranial morphology of two populations experiencing the epidemiological transition associated with decreased mortality rates in children, followed by declines in infant mortality and subsequent increases in adult longevity. The two samples examined in this study come from US and Portuguese individuals. The epidemiological transition occurred at different times in the United States and Portugal, with Portugal entering into the transition later than the United States. The results of the study show that the US and Portuguese samples experienced significant changes in cranial morphology during the approximately 150 years under study. In all of the samples the cranial base morphology changes significantly over time. However, the pattern of change in the US and Portuguese samples varies in the other regions of the crania. The US samples exhibit significant changes associated with the posterior cranial fossa, which experiences the greatest growth during the fetal period and the first year of life. Conversely, in the Portuguese samples the region of the cranium that shows the greatest change is in the face and lateral cranial base, which experiences the greatest growth from three to nine years. This differential pattern may reflect differences in changing mortality patterns in the two countries. During the period under study the United States had already proceeded through the early stages of the epidemiological transition, and improvements in the juvenile mortality and juvenile growth had occurred previously. Subsequently, the United States experienced significant declines in infant mortality, and the regions of the crania that exhibit the greatest changes occur in area with maximum growth velocity under one year. However, Portugal entered into the epidemiological transition later than the United States and therefore the greatest changes in growth occurred during the juvenile period, which is reflected in the adult morphology in this group. This study demonstrates the utility of variation in growth patterns in different cranial regions to document changes in the demographic parameters in two different populations.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0018-7143	1534-6617		WOS:000389637400003	27737574

While academia explores use cases in various contexts, industry has focused on data centre networks' limited but intense needs. There is a significant range of complex and application-specific network services that can potentially benefit from SDN, but introduction and adoption of such solutions remains slow in production networks. One impeding factor is the lack of a simple yet expressive enough framework applicable to all SDN services across production network domains. Without a uniform framework, SDN developers create disjoint solutions, resulting in untenable management and maintenance overhead. In this paper, we propose an agent-based framework, which enabled the development of three distinct SDN services addressing the needs of network operators, application providers, and application users. The architecture facilitates application-oriented SDN design with an abstraction composed of software agents on top of the underlying network.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1754-3916	1754-3924		WOS:000389803900004

Improved characterization of this new system for performing precise and accurate isotope ratio (IR) determinations is demonstrated. The instrumental parameters evaluated include the number of microscans and scans making up a data acquisition set, uranium concentration/signal level, sample make-up, and Fourier transform digitization window. A limiting precision of 0.41% relative standard deviation (RSD) can be achieved for a single determination with natural uranium, with a variability of 1.63% RSD over 10 separate analytical measurements, reflective of instrument drift. A study of matrix effects on IR measurements of U is also presented, highlighting the importance of pre-mass selection before injection into the Orbitrap MS. Dynamic range is demonstrated with response curves covering 4 orders of magnitude of concentration (similar to 1-1000 ng mL(-1)) and having an R-2 value of >0.99. These results demonstrate the very promising pairing of the LS-APGD ionization source and the Orbitrap MS, pointing as well to definitive paths forward to better utilize both components in high quality isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS).									0	0	0	0	0	0			0267-9477	1364-5544		WOS:000389341000001

This general capability is often referred to as system resilience. While there have been some efforts devoted to incorporating resilience in the design of new water pipeline systems, limited attention has been given to resilience in rehabilitation planning of existing water systems, except in regions that are prone to natural hazards such as earthquakes. This paper presents a rehabilitation planning framework that considers system resilience as one of the principal objectives. Resilience is defined as the ability of the system to withstand stresses and cope with failures. While past performance data is leveraged to estimate the integrity (or robustness) of the system, various rehabilitation planning alternatives are evaluated based on the redundancy that they add to the system. The proposed framework is demonstrated using asset data and past performance data of 10-years obtained from a coastal water utility. This paper provides general guidance to utility managers and design engineers in embedding resilience in the rehabilitation planning and design of water pipeline systems.

As data sizes become increasingly large, often combined with their locations being far from the applications, the well known impact of lower TCP throughput over large delay-bandwidth product paths becomes more significant to these applications. While myriads of solutions exist to alleviate the problem, they require specialized software at both the application host and the remote data server, making it hard to scale up to a large range of applications and execution environments. A software defined networking based solution called Steroid OpenFlow Service (SOS) has been proposed as a network service that transparently increases the throughput of data transfers across large networks. In this paper, the SOS architecture is refined to support data transfer at scale. In an OpenFlow-based cloud environment such as GENI, SOS can leverage the use of multiple agents to provide increased network throughput for many applications simultaneously. A cloud-based approach is particularly beneficial to applications in environments without access to high performance networks. This paper introduces the scalable SOS architecture and demonstrates its viability and scalability in GENI's distributed testbed.

S	Thapa, Anup; Corzine, Keith; Venayagamoorthy, Ganesh Kumar						Gao, DW; Muljadi, E; Zhang, J; Khodaei, A		Grid-Tied Power Converter with GPS Capability for Smart Grid Applications								2016 North American Power Symposium (NAPS)		North American Power Symposium												2016	2016	This paper proposes a bi-directional grid-tied converter with GPS capability for smart-grid applications. The novelty of this converter is that time-stamped grid voltage angle received via network communication channels has been used to synchronize the converter to the grid. Therefore, all grid-tied converters in a microgrid with this development will not require line voltage sensing and phase-locked loops. The power section and modulation was built on a CompactRIO 9064 that also had a GPS timesource. In a larger power system, a nearby PMU can be used for the time source. A PMU capable controller is placed at the point of common coupling to measure the electrical angle of the microgrid. The electrical angle is time stamped with GPS time and communicated to the power converter which is then used for grid synchronization. This paper presents the results obtained during operation of the PMU capable converter in both rectifying mode and inversion mode.					48th North American Power Symposium (NAPS)48th North American Power Symposium (NAPS)	SEP 18-20, 2016SEP 18-20, 2016	IEEE; IEEE Power & Energy Soc, NAPS student Program; U S Natl Sci Fdn; Xcel Energy; Natl Renewable Energy Lab; ABB; Burns & McDonnell; Nayak Corp PSCAD RTDS; Western Area Power Adm; Tri-State Generat & Transmission Assoc; Ulteig; IEEE PES Young Professionals; Colorado Springs UtilitiesIEEE; IEEE Power & Energy Soc, NAPS student Program; U S Natl Sci Fdn; Xcel Energy; Natl Renewable Energy Lab; ABB; Burns & McDonnell; Nayak Corp PSCAD RTDS; Western Area Power Adm; Tri-State Generat & Transmission Assoc; Ulteig; IEEE PES Young Professionals; Colorado Springs Utilities	Univ Denver, Denver, COUniv Denver, Denver, CO	0	0	0	0	0	0			2163-4939		978-1-5090-3270-9	WOS:000389280900163

A cellular computational network (CCN) is used as the SI algorithm. CCN is a framework for distributed multi-timescale frequency prediction by utilizing the local and neighboring phasor measurement units (PMUs). The predicted frequency values are utilized for coherency analysis. The advantages of the CCN are scalability and distributedness which caters for on-line predicted coherency analysis for large power systems. The multi-time scale frequency predictions mitigates or minimizes delays in power system measurements and provides an insight to the power system coherent behavior apriori. The simulation studies on the New York-New England IEEE benchmark power system are presented to demonstrate that CCN based SI can be utilized in online coherency analysis. Predicted measurements can enhance resiliency to bad data. Furthermore, it is possible to utilize this approach for adaptive control of wide area power systems.					48th North American Power Symposium (NAPS)48th North American Power Symposium (NAPS)	SEP 18-20, 2016SEP 18-20, 2016	IEEE; IEEE Power & Energy Soc, NAPS student Program; U S Natl Sci Fdn; Xcel Energy; Natl Renewable Energy Lab; ABB; Burns & McDonnell; Nayak Corp PSCAD RTDS; Western Area Power Adm; Tri-State Generat & Transmission Assoc; Ulteig; IEEE PES Young Professionals; Colorado Springs UtilitiesIEEE; IEEE Power & Energy Soc, NAPS student Program; U S Natl Sci Fdn; Xcel Energy; Natl Renewable Energy Lab; ABB; Burns & McDonnell; Nayak Corp PSCAD RTDS; Western Area Power Adm; Tri-State Generat & Transmission Assoc; Ulteig; IEEE PES Young Professionals; Colorado Springs Utilities	Univ Denver, Denver, COUniv Denver, Denver, CO	0	0	0	0	0	0			2163-4939		978-1-5090-3270-9	WOS:000389280900047

Specifically, we review the process of circumnutation, which is used by numerous plants, and particularly climbing vines, to explore and contact their environments. We show how circumnutation can be adapted to generate practical algorithms for motion planning for continuum tendril robots. The analysis and discussion is supported by experimental results using a robot tendril. Using circumnutation, performance of the robot is enhanced by efficiently enabling environmental contact, which helps guide and stabilize the robot.					14th International Conference on the Simulation of Adaptive Behavior (SAB)14th International Conference on the Simulation of Adaptive Behavior (SAB)	AUG 23-26, 2016AUG 23-26, 2016	Aberystwyth Univ, Dept Comp Sci; Int Soc Adapt Behavior; WebotsAberystwyth Univ, Dept Comp Sci; Int Soc Adapt Behavior; Webots	Aberystwyth Univ, Aberystwyth, WALESAberystwyth Univ, Aberystwyth, WALES	0	0	0	0	0	0			0302-9743		978-3-319-43488-9; 978-3-319-43487-2	WOS:000389342300001

Two eye tracking data sets were collected for different basemaps (37 participants and 1,328 trials in total). We found significant differences in mean pupil diameter between tasks, indicating low cognitive load for free exploration, medium cognitive load for search, polygon comparison, line following, and high cognitive load for route planning and focused search. Pupil diameter also changed over time within trials which can be interpreted as an increase in cognitive load for search and focused search, and a decrease for line following. Such results can be used for the adaptation of maps and geovisualizations based on their users' cognitive load.					9th International Conference on Geographic Information Science (GIScience)9th International Conference on Geographic Information Science (GIScience)	SEP 27-30, 2016SEP 27-30, 2016	ESRI; McGill; Geothink; Univ Laval; Convergence; Univ Saskatchewan; Social Sci Res LabESRI; McGill; Geothink; Univ Laval; Convergence; Univ Saskatchewan; Social Sci Res Lab	Montreal, CANADAMontreal, CANADA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0302-9743		978-3-319-45737-6; 978-3-319-45738-3	WOS:000389231900021

This paper focuses on how cybercrimes impact undergraduate students, a group particularly vulnerable to cybercrimes due to their extensive use of technology and their recently gained financial responsibility and social independence. We present a mixed methods study to understand students' knowledge, perceptions, and behaviors regarding cybercrimes. 10 semi-structured interviews provided the groundwork for a theoretical model, which was subsequently tested on a sample of 222 survey responses. We found that roughly half of the undergraduate students in our studies have experienced one or more cybercrimes while in college, with malware, hacking, and phishing being the most prominently experienced cybercrimes. Furthermore, we found that students acquire their knowledge of cybercrimes predominantly through people they personally know who have been victimized by a cybercrime and the media. Our model shows how students' knowledge of cybercrimes and their self-control in using the Internet influences their perceived cybercrime self-efficacy and their fear of cybercrimes. Self-efficacy and fear, in turn, influence their tendency to take preventative measures to avoid enabling behaviors and to report cybercrimes to the appropriate entities. We also find that despite the reported importance of adequate cybercrime reporting and access to comprehensive cybercrime statistics, the majority of students do not know how to officially report a cybercrime.

For many imperative programming languages, however, the modular verification of this independence is often frustrated by (i) the possibility of aliasing between variables mentioned in different threads, and (ii) the lack of abstraction in the description of read/write effects of operations on shared data structures. We describe a specification and verification framework in which abstract specifications of functional behavior are augmented with abstract interference effects that permit verification of client code with concurrent calls to operations of a data abstraction. To illustrate the approach, we present a classic concurrent data abstraction: the bounded queue. Three different implementations are described, each with different degrees of entanglement and hence different degrees of possible synchronization-free concurrency.					8th International Conference on Verified Software - Theories, Tool and Experiments (VSTTE)8th International Conference on Verified Software - Theories, Tool and Experiments (VSTTE)	JUL 17-18, 2016JUL 17-18, 2016		Toronto, CANADAToronto, CANADA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0302-9743		978-3-319-48869-1; 978-3-319-48868-4	WOS:000389506400009

As its spatial resolution is gained by phase modulation of the light field, the aberrations produced by optical systems and specimens may have negative impact on the focusing properties of two beams, especially the STED beam, resulting in reduced spatial resolution. In thick samples, the aberration effect may play an even more critical role in affecting spatial resolution. Here, we report our recent effort in correcting the aberration in STED microscopy by using coherent optical adaptive technique (COAT) so that the resolution can be improved.

Since conduction loss investigation is advantageous in design phase of converters, this paper presents an analytical approach to calculate and investigate conduction power loss in ANPC converter. First, rms and average currents of IGBTs and anti-parallel diodes are analytically calculated by considering the associated duty cycle of each IGBT and diode, converter modulation index, load current, and load power factor. Numerical results of the derived analytical equations to calculate rms and average current of IGBT/diode are compared against simulation results and experimental measurements. All simulation, analytic, and experimental results agree well with each other which substantiate derived closed-form equations. Afterwards, obtained equations for rms and average current computations are utilized to calculate conduction power losses in a 12.4MVA 3.3kV 9-level (line-to-line) ANPC converter analytically. For this purpose, a 2.5kV 1.5kA IGBT module from ABB is considered as a power switch.					31st Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition (APEC)31st Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition (APEC)	MAR 20-24, 2016MAR 20-24, 2016	IEEEIEEE	Long Beach, CALong Beach, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0			1048-2334		978-1-4673-9550-2	WOS:000388127300108

Output voltage of the stacked multicell converter controlled with proposed active voltage balancing method can be modulated with any pulse-width-modulation techniques such as phase-shiftedcarrier or level-shifted-carrier pulse-width-modulation.

This paper proposes a new flying-capacitor-based multilevel converter to minimize the number of flying capacitors (FCs) and power switches. The advantage of the proposed FC-based multilevel converter in comparison with the conventional flying capacitor multicell converter is the fewer number of FCs. In comparison with the stacked multicell converter, the proposed multilevel converter requires less number of the semiconductor switches. In order to balance the voltage of the FCs in proposed multilevel converter, a new active voltage balancing method which is fully implemented utilizing logic-form equations is presented. The proposed voltage balancing method, measures output current and FC voltages to generate switching states to produce the required output voltage level as well as balance FC voltages at their reference values. The output voltage of the proposed multilevel converter controlled with suggested active voltage balancing method can be modulated with any pulse-width-modulation (PWM) method such as phase-shifted-carrier PWM (PSC-PWM) or level-shifted-carrier PWM (LSC-PWM).

Dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) is well-known and reliable solution to mitigate this phenomenon and protect the sensitive loads. This paper proposes new configuration of DVR for medium voltage applications. The proposed configuration contains diode rectifier to converter power grid voltage to medium voltage dc link which is split between capacitors working at low-voltage level. Next stage is couple of full bridge (FB) dc-dc converters which are stacked together and each is fed with low voltage. Each FB dc-dc converter contains high frequency (HF) transformer to make isolated dc link for each phase since DVR needs to inject isolated voltage in each phase individually. Last stage of proposed configuration is the cascaded multicell inverter (CMI) which works as series converter of DVR to inject required voltage. The output of each FB dc-dc converters are fed to one cell of CMI. CMI is controlled with phase shifted sinusoidal pulse width modulation to absorb the same power from each cell causing to split the voltage of main dc link equally between low-voltage capacitors. Simulation results of the proposed configuration are presented to show the performance and effectiveness of the circuit.					31st Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition (APEC)31st Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition (APEC)	MAR 20-24, 2016MAR 20-24, 2016	IEEEIEEE	Long Beach, CALong Beach, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0			1048-2334		978-1-4673-9550-2	WOS:000388127302053

By detailing examples from a university in the Southeastern USA and the communities it serves, we suggest game-based research and learning be approached as a unifying influence adaptable across contexts.Design/methodology/approach - We use a working example methodology where someone with expertise "works through" a well-known issue while making the thinking overt. In this manner, we reveal processes, successes and challenges infusing game-based learning in higher education to deepen understanding between fields and encourage research and practice with games across disciplines.Findings - The working example demonstrates that games served as a unifying influence in three primary ways, which included redesigning courses and implementing programmatic changes; using existing programs to promote interdisciplinary teaching and research; and increasing outreach and partnerships. In each example, games served to strengthen or support the initiatives.Originality/value - This paper extends literature on the value of games to promote research and learning. Significantly, it provides an example for others in game-based learning fields to consider when building similar programs in higher education.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1074-8121	2054-1708		WOS:000389343600002

The authors provide important aspects of their findings as usable knowledge in the form of implications for potential use in new contexts.Design/methodology/approach - This is a case study of one instance of a course-based structured learning opportunity. The authors chose to interview each other about various aspects of the course structure and its affordances and constraints for creating an effective and supportive learning environment.Findings - The paper provides findings as implications for potential transfer to new contexts. As considerations for engendering the type of learning the authors promote, they share much of the interview responses in an effort to not only contextualize their perspectives but also identify important aspects for similar projects.Research limitations/implications - As a single case, the authors focus on areas of transferability rather than generalizability. With more cases, they could build the list of important aspects, but with this individual case, they can simply share the ideas they find most salient from their work.Practical implications - The paper includes implications for those interested in creating similar opportunities that combine undergraduate research projects and coursework to enhance students' ability to pursue individual interests typically not found in traditional course models.Originality/value - This paper provides an example of a non-traditional opportunity for learning as a potential model for others.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1074-8121	2054-1708		WOS:000389343600013

In the first stage, we exploit Constraint Programing (CP) techniques to contract the variable bounds. In the second stage we partition the variables domains using a dynamic multivariate partitioning scheme. Instead of equally partitioning the domains of variables appearing in multi-linear terms, we construct sparser partitions yet tighter relaxations by iteratively partitioning the variable domains in regions of interest. This approach decouples the number of partitions from the size of the variable domains, leads to a significant reduction in computation time, and limits the number of binary variables that are introduced by the partitioning. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on well-known benchmark problems from MINLPLIB and discuss the computational benefits of CP-based bound tightening procedures.					22nd International Conference on the Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming (CP)22nd International Conference on the Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming (CP)	SEP 05-09, 2016SEP 05-09, 2016	IJCAI, Artificial Intelligence Journal Div; French Natl Inst Agronom Res; Microsoft Res; French Natl Ctr Sci Res; IBM; Cadence; Siemens; CSIRO, Data 61; Toulouse Univ; Springer; Mol Bioinformat GdR; Toulouse Comp Sci Inst; French Natl Off Aeros Res & Studies; Inst Computat Sustainabil; European Assoc Artificial Intelligence; Swedish Inst Comp Sci; French Soc Operat Res & Assisted Decis Making; N Side; Cosling; Cosytec & LocalSolverIJCAI, Artificial Intelligence Journal Div; French Natl Inst Agronom Res; Microsoft Res; French Natl Ctr Sci Res; IBM; Cadence; Siemens; CSIRO, Data 61; Toulouse Univ; Springer; Mol Bioinformat GdR; Toulouse Comp Sci Inst; French Natl Off Aeros Res & Studies; Inst Computat Sustainabil; European Assoc Artificial Intelligence; Swedish Inst Comp Sci; French Soc Operat Res & Assisted Decis Making; N Side; Cosling; Cosytec & LocalSolver	Toulouse Business Sch, Toulouse, FRANCEToulouse Business Sch, Toulouse, FRANCE	0	0	0	0	0	0			0302-9743		978-3-319-44953-1; 978-3-319-44952-4	WOS:000389019700025

ASME					PERFORMANCE CHARACTERIZATION OF BI-DIRECTIONAL TURBINES FOR USE IN THERMOACOUSTIC GENERATOR APPLICATIONS								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME 10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY, 2016, VOL 1										UNSP V001T09A001				2016	2016	Bi-directional turbines convert oscillating axial fluid flow into uniform radial rotation and have proven effective in wave energy harvesting applications, like ocean wave generators. Two of the most widely studied designs for these scenarios are the Wells and axial turbines. This study characterizes the effectiveness of these turbines for use with a thermoacoustic generator; which is a relatively new technology that uses an induced temperature gradient to propagate acoustic waves within an enclosed, looped chamber. These generators are widely applied to refrigeration cycle systems; yet when paired with a bi-directional turbine, the resulting sound wave can be harnessed to generate electricity.This paper begins with a discussion of the thermoacoustic application covering relevant issues for the turbine. Next, the Wells, axial, and a combined hybrid turbine are presented in thorough detail including governing design features that were explored. Fabrication of a test fixture and turbine prototypes and experimental results from a broad ranging study of the performance of the turbine designs is shown. Finally, conclusions from the obtained results are discussed.					10th ASME International Conference on Energy Sustainability10th ASME International Conference on Energy Sustainability	JUN 26-30, 2016JUN 26-30, 2016	ASME, Adv Energy Syst Div; ASME, Solar Energy DivASME, Adv Energy Syst Div; ASME, Solar Energy Div	Charlotte, NCCharlotte, NC	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-5022-0	WOS:000389094800070

Embedding flexible fibers into responsive gels to create composites with controllable dexterity								SOFT MATTER				12	45			9170	9184		10.1039/c6sm02006b			2016	2016	Using computational modeling, we design a composite that encompasses a thermo-responsive gel and photo-responsive fibers that extend from the surface of the gel. By simulating the effect of light and heat on the sample, we isolate scenarios where cooperative interactions within the system allow the gel to actuate the "finger-like'' motion of the embedded fibers. To achieve this distinctive behavior, we consider a gel formed from poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm), which shrinks when heated above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST). The fibers are functionalized with spirobenzopyran (SP) chromophores that extend a finite region into the polymer network. The application of heat causes the entire gel to shrink, while the application of light causes the regions around the functionalized fibers to collapse. With the fibers arranged in a square or circular pattern in the center of the gel, heating the non-illuminated samples drives the fibers to move apart as they bend outward (away from the center). With the application of light, the tips of fibers come together as the fibers bend inward. In this configuration, the fibers could act as grippers that bind objects in the presence of light. With the illumination turned off, the grippers could controllably release the objects. By placing the fibers closer to the edge of the sample, the combination of heat and light could be harnessed to bind and release larger objects. We also show that by illuminating the fibers separately, we can manipulate the motion of the individual finger-like objects, and thus, potentially expand the utility of the system. Overall, our findings provide guidelines for controllably reconfiguring the shape of soft materials and thus, tailoring the material to display different functionalities in different environments.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1744-683X	1744-6848		WOS:000388928100005	27759145

We find that sample size for manuscripts published at CHI ranges from 1 - 916,000 and the most common sample size is 12. We also find that sample size differs based on factors such as study setting and type of methodology employed. The outcome of this paper is an overview of the various ways sample size may be determined and an analysis of local standards for sample size within the CHI community These contributions may be useful to researchers planning studies and reviewers evaluating the validity of results.					34th Annual CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI4GOOD)34th Annual CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI4GOOD)	MAY 07-12, 2016MAY 07-12, 2016	Assoc Comp Machinery; SIG CHIAssoc Comp Machinery; SIG CHI	San Jose, CASan Jose, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4503-3362-7	WOS:000380532901002

ACM					A Model Relating Pupil Diameter to Mental Workload and Lighting Conditions								34TH ANNUAL CHI CONFERENCE ON HUMAN FACTORS IN COMPUTING SYSTEMS, CHI 2016								5776	5788		10.1145/2858036.2858117			2016	2016	In this paper, we present a proof-of-concept approach to estimating mental workload by measuring the user's pupil diameter under various controlled lighting conditions. Knowing the user's mental workload is desirable for many application scenarios, ranging from driving a car, to adaptive workplace setups. Typically, physiological sensors allow inferring mental workload, but these sensors might be rather uncomfortable to wear.Measuring pupil diameter through remote eye-tracking instead is an unobtrusive method. However, a practical eye-tracking-based system must also account for pupil changes due to variable lighting conditions. Based on the results of a study with tasks of varying mental demand and six different lighting conditions, we built a simple model that is able to infer the workload independently of the lighting condition in 75 % of the tested conditions.					34th Annual CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI4GOOD)34th Annual CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI4GOOD)	MAY 07-12, 2016MAY 07-12, 2016	Assoc Comp Machinery; SIG CHIAssoc Comp Machinery; SIG CHI	San Jose, CASan Jose, CA	1	0	0	0	0	1					978-1-4503-3362-7	WOS:000380532905068

Adult females tunnel into the stems and branches of host plants to create galleries with brood chambers. Hosts are infected with symbiotic Ambrosiella spp. fungi that serve as food for the larvae and adults. Plants can also become infected with secondary opportunistic pathogens, including Fusarium spp. Both X. germanus and X. crassiusculus have broad host ranges, and infestations can result in "toothpicks" of extruded chewed wood and sap flow associated with gallery entrances, canopy dieback, stem and trunk cankers, and plant death. Beetles efficiently locate and preferentially attack living, weakened plants, especially those physiologically stressed by flooding, inadequate drainage, frost injury, or winter injury and low temperature. Maintaining plant health is the foundation of a management plan. Vulnerable hosts can be partially protected with preventive pyrethroid applications in the spring before peak flight and attack, which are monitored using ethanol-based trapping tactics.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-7470			WOS:000388297800009		
J	Song, Yang; Hua, Liwei; Lei, Jincheng; Zhang, Qi; Liu, Jie; Ye, Lingyun; Xiao, Hai								An IFPI Temperature Sensor Fabricated in an Unstriped Optical Fiber with Self-Strain-Compensation Function								JOURNAL OF SENSORS										6419623	10.1155/2016/6419623			2016	2016	This paper describes an intrinsic Fabry-Perot interferometer (IFPI) temperature sensor with self-strain-compensation function. The sensor was fabricated on a buffer-intact optical fiber using a femtosecond (fs) laser system. The use of fs laser allows the sensor to be fabricated in an optical fiber without the necessity of removing the polymer buffer coating, thus not compromising its mechanical property. The sensor is composed of two cascaded IFPIs in different cavity length of 100 mu m and 500 mu m, respectively. The shorter IFPI serves as the temperature sensor, while the second IFPI serves as a compensation sensor, which is used to decouple the strain from the raw signal collected by the shorter FPI. The reflection spectrum of sensor, containing both sensory information and compensation information, is collected in wavelength domain and demultiplexed in the Fourier domain of reflection spectrum. An algorithm was developed and successfully implemented to compensate the strain influence on the proposed temperature sensor. The results showed that the proposed sensor structure holds a constant temperature sensitivity of 11.33 pm/degrees C when strained differently.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1687-725X	1687-7268		WOS:000388407700001

Humans remain a cost effective solution to adapt to the requirements of increasing product complexity and variety present in today's flexible manufacturing systems. The human element present in the manufacturing system necessitates a better understanding of the human role in manufacturing complexity. Presented herein is a framework for enumerating assembly variables correlated with the potential for quality defect, presented in the design, process, and human factors domain.

Without these materials the industries would fail to achieve new heights of efficiency as the strength and operating temperature requirements continue to climb. Nickel-based superalloys thrive in these elevated temperature applications, where their great resistance to creep and corrosion is coupled with remarkably high strength values. These same characteristics that are invaluable to the final operating environment severely degrade their machinability with high cutting forces and aggressive rate of tool wear.Although the field of machining research is very well established, when it comes to nickel-based superalloys there is a large amount of that is yet to be understood. Trochoidal milling has been identified to extend tool life and reduce machining time in the milling of aluminums, however in nickel-based superalloys it remains largely unexplored. This work aims to understand the cutting force behavior of milling nickel-based superalloys using this alternative milling technique.					44th North American Manufacturing Research Conference (NAMRC)44th North American Manufacturing Research Conference (NAMRC)	JUN 27-JUL 01, 2016JUN 27-JUL 01, 2016		Blacksburg, VABlacksburg, VA	0	0	0	0	0	0			2351-9789		*****************	WOS:000387592400101

Finite Element Modeling of Chloride Diffusion in Concrete Using Image Processing for Characterizing Real Shape and Distribution of Different Phases								ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING MATERIALS				5	1			167	178		10.1520/ACEM20150032			2016	2016	The objective of this work was to establish an approach to create a finite element based model using the actual image of the surface of the concrete. An image from the polished surface of a concrete specimen was prepared and used to develop the model. The model considered the actual shape of both fine and coarse aggregates and the interfacial transition zone (ITZ) around aggregates. To validate the model, concrete cylinders were exposed to chloride solution and the chloride penetration in concrete cylinders was measured at different times. Results showed that the model could precisely predict the chloride diffusion time, depth, and pattern through concrete. In addition, results indicated that it is imperative to consider all phases including the ITZ around both coarse and fine aggregate, when modeling concrete. The advantages and benefits of the image processing approach for model preparation, including incorporating all concrete phases with their real shapes, were discussed in this paper.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2165-3984			WOS:000387925100002

It is an implicit, unstructured grid finite element code that hosts a set of advanced features that are readily combined within a single analysis run. Albany uses template-based generic programming methods to provide extensibility and flexibility; it employs a generic residual evaluation interface to support the easy addition and modification of physics. This interface is coupled to powerful automatic differentiation utilities that are used to implement efficient nonlinear solvers and preconditioners, and also to enable sensitivity analysis and embedded uncertainty quantification capabilities as part of the forward solve. The flexible application programming interfaces in Albany couple to two different adaptive mesh libraries; it internally employs generic integration machinery that supports tetrahedral, hexahedral, and hybrid meshes of user specified order. We present the overall design of Albany, and focus on the specifics of the integration of many of its advanced features. As Albany and the components that form it are openly available on the internet, it is our goal that the reader might find some of the design concepts useful in their own work. Albany results in a code that enables the rapid development of parallel, numerically efficient multiphysics software tools. In discussing the features and details of the integration of many of the components involved, we show the reader the wide variety of solution components that are available and what is possible when they are combined within a simulation capability.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1543-1649	1940-4352		WOS:000388092400006

Many existing scheduling approaches in cloud datacenters try to consolidate virtual machines (VMs) to the minimum number of physical machines (PMs) and hence minimize the energy consumption. VM live migration technique is used to dynamically consolidate VMs to as few PMs as possible; however, it introduces high migration overhead. Furthermore, the cost factor is usually not taken into account by existing approaches, which will lead to high payment cost for cloud users. In this paper, we aim to achieve energy reduction for cloud providers and payment saving for cloud users, and at the same time, without introducing VM migration overhead and without compromising deadline guarantees for user tasks. Motivated by the fact that some of the tasks have relatively loose deadlines, we can further reduce energy consumption by proactively postponing the tasks without waking up new PMs. In this paper, we propose a heuristic task scheduling algorithm called Energy and Deadline Aware with Non-Migration Scheduling (EDA-NMS) algorithm. EDA-NMS exploits the looseness of task deadlines and tries to postpone the execution of the tasks that have loose deadlines in order to avoid waking up new PMs. When determining the VM instant types, EDA-NMS selects the instant types that are just sufficient to guarantee task deadline to reduce user payment cost. The results of extensive experiments show that our algorithm performs better than other existing algorithms on achieving energy efficiency without introducing VM migration overhead and without compromising deadline guarantees.					10th International Conference on Network and System Security (NSS)10th International Conference on Network and System Security (NSS)	SEP 28-30, 2016SEP 28-30, 2016	Chinese Cryptol & Informat Secur AssocChinese Cryptol & Informat Secur Assoc	Taipei, TAIWANTaipei, TAIWAN	0	0	0	0	0	0			0302-9743		978-3-319-46298-1; 978-3-319-46297-4	WOS:000388133600006

One of the biggest limiting factors in the large scale use of carbon fiber (CF) in manufacturing is its high cost. The costs involved in manufacturing the carbon fiber have been formalized into a cost model in order to facilitate the understanding of these factors. This can play a key role in manufacturing CF in a cost effective method. This cost model accounts for the fixed and variable costs involved in all stages of manufacturing, in addition to accounting for price elasticity.					11th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC 2016)11th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC 2016)	JUN 27-JUL 01, 2016JUN 27-JUL 01, 2016	ASME, Mfg Engn DivASME, Mfg Engn Div	Blacksburg, VABlacksburg, VA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-4989-7	WOS:000388159100044		
B	Khal, Abdelrahim; Ruszkiewicz, Brandt J.; Mears, Laine			ASME					SPRINGBACK EVALUATION OF 304 STAINLESS STEEL IN AN ELECTRICALLY ASSISTED AIR BENDING OPERATION								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME 11TH INTERNATIONAL MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, 2016, VOL 1										UNSP V001T02A020				2016	2016	Driven by the automotive industry's drive towards lightweighting, electrically assisted forming (EAF) is one of the most rapidly growing research fields in bulk deformation, and is classified under the general term "Electrically-Assisted Manufacturing (EAM)". In EAF electric current (continuous or intermittent) is applied to a metallic sheet during the forming process, leading to numerous advantageous effects that have been studied and proven by several research groups and for different structural metals, such as reduced forming load and flow stress, increased formability, and reduction (or even elimination) of springback. Electrically-assisted bending (EAB) is a recent evolution of EAF technique, with the aim of capitalizing on the aforementioned advantages of EAF technique. In this work the effects of the EAB process on the final springback in an air bending test are identified, with the metal sheet being bent under different electrical field conditions. In addition, a comparison between the effects of applying the current during forming versus post forming are investigated. It was found that in general, higher current density (amount of current through cross sectional area of specimen (A/mm(2)), more frequent pulse period, and longer pulse duration all resulted in a greater degree of springback reduction. A microstructural evaluation showed no change in grain size in the presence of electric current.					11th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC 2016)11th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC 2016)	JUN 27-JUL 01, 2016JUN 27-JUL 01, 2016	ASME, Mfg Engn DivASME, Mfg Engn Div	Blacksburg, VABlacksburg, VA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-4989-7	WOS:000388159100020

ASME					RESIDUAL STRESSES IN FLOW DRILL SCREWDRIVING OF ALUMINUM ALLOY SHEETS								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME 11TH INTERNATIONAL MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, 2016, VOL 1										UNSP V001T02A012				2016	2016	With an increase in fuel economy standards and the need for reducing emissions set for the automotive sector, has resulted in the increased demand for lightweight vehicles. It is well know that the single heaviest component of a passenger vehicle is the body structure, thus has the greatest potential for significantly reducing the vehicles mass. Therefore, transitioning from steel based bodies to ones composed of lightweight materials, such as: aluminum, magnesium and advanced high strength steels are of great interest. However, with the introduction of these new materials comes with a new means of joining, where conventional methods do not work. Therefore, this work examines a novel joining technique, flow drill screwdriving which is a thermo-mechanical process for joining aluminum and dissimilar materials. The focus of this work is to examine the residual stress distribution in a joint, because mechanical behavior and joint quality are greatly affected by the residual stress. Neutron diffraction was used for the determination of the residual stress in two samples processed with low and high fastener force. The high penetration depth of neutron radiation allows for the determination of triaxial residual stress states inside the material without destruction of the sample. It was found that the stress field around the joint location is primarily in tension, which is problematic if external forces are applied near the joint. Therefore, additional stress measurements were conducted under applied load through a lap shear test. Two load levels were applied to determine the effects on stress concentrations around the proximity of the joint.					11th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC 2016)11th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC 2016)	JUN 27-JUL 01, 2016JUN 27-JUL 01, 2016	ASME, Mfg Engn DivASME, Mfg Engn Div	Blacksburg, VABlacksburg, VA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-4989-7	WOS:000388159100012		
B	Ruszkiewicz, Brandt J.; Mears, Laine			ASME					TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED FORMING OF 7075-T6 ALUMINUM USING LINEARLY DECAYING DIRECT ELECTRIC CURRENT								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME 11TH INTERNATIONAL MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, 2016, VOL 1										UNSP V001T02A014				2016	2016	The push in the automotive industry towards lightweighting to meet new stricter fuel efficiency standards has driven the need to research lightweight material forming. This requires research into forming high strength materials, as well as lower strength lightweight materials that may typically have poor formability characteristics. 7075-T6 aluminum suffers from limited elongation during tensile forming; electrically assisted forming, which uses direct current to improve formability, is a viable candidate process to improve formability. In past electrical tension testing by various authors, two types of wave forms have been examined: continuous current and square waveforms. For tension it was shown that applying current using square waveforms was able to extend formability beyond what continuous current could produce, due to reducing the overheating in the necking region. This paper examines the effect of a non-decaying and linearly globally decaying saw tooth wave on the formability and flow stress of 7075-T6 aluminum in tension. It is shown that EAM using a sawtooth waveform can result in further elongation than cold forming, with similar elongation to previously-investigated square waves. An existing temperature model is adapted to the saw tooth waveform and used to calculate the change in material properties to find the flow stress using a theoretical strength equation.					11th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC 2016)11th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC 2016)	JUN 27-JUL 01, 2016JUN 27-JUL 01, 2016	ASME, Mfg Engn DivASME, Mfg Engn Div	Blacksburg, VABlacksburg, VA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-4989-7	WOS:000388159100014		
B	Ruszkiewicz, Brandt J.; Mears, Laine			ASME					ELECTRICALLY ASSISTED COMPRESSION OF TUNGSTEN CARBIDE AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR ELECTRICALLY ASSISTED MACHINING								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME 11TH INTERNATIONAL MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, 2016, VOL 1										UNSP V001T02A013				2016	2016	It has been shown that electrically assisted machining has the ability to reduce cutting force, change chip type, and improve surface finish. However, the effect of electricity on tungsten carbide has not been examined, a material often used to create cutting tools used in electrically assisted machining. During machining processes, depending on the type of cut, a small amount of the tool may be in contact with the workpiece. This will lead to an increased current density at that point on the tool which could lead to undesired effects with respect to tool wear and life. This paper conducts electrically assisted compression tests on uncoated tungsten carbide rod to examine the effect of electricity on the material and determine if there are any current densities that cause large magnitude weakening of the tungsten carbide. It is concluded that there is a maximum current density that can be passed through tungsten carbide before thermal softening becomes a problem. At a current density lower than this threshold, electricity has little effect on the strength of the carbide. This work is related to past electrically assisted turning experimentation.					11th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC 2016)11th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC 2016)	JUN 27-JUL 01, 2016JUN 27-JUL 01, 2016	ASME, Mfg Engn DivASME, Mfg Engn Div	Blacksburg, VABlacksburg, VA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-4989-7	WOS:000388159100013

One joining technology particularly suited for one-sided multi-material joining is Flow Drill Screwdriving (FDS), a process by which a fastener friction drills, penetrates the joint, thread-forms, and then torques to apply clamping pressure to the joint. The frictional nature of FDS induces thermal softening of the material but requires time for the heat to build. Prior work with thermal assistance has shown that increasing pre-process temperature leads directly to reducing penetration time, but may add to overall cycle time. A more efficient augmentation approach through Electrical Augmentation (EA) is investigated to reduce cycle time. An experimental investigation of the EA-FDS process is presented, with the joint metrics quantified through installation torque, process time, and breakloose torque. EA-FDS is shown to reduce cycle time, and have the ability to join thicker cross-sections.					11th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC 2016)11th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC 2016)	JUN 27-JUL 01, 2016JUN 27-JUL 01, 2016	ASME, Mfg Engn DivASME, Mfg Engn Div	Blacksburg, VABlacksburg, VA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-4989-7	WOS:000388159100010

Response of driven sessile drops with contact-line dissipation								SOFT MATTER				12	43			8919	8926		10.1039/c6sm01928e			2016	2016	A partially-wetting sessile drop is driven by a sinusoidal pressure field that produces capillary waves on the liquid/gas interface. Response diagrams and phase shifts for the droplet, whose contact-line moves with contact-angle that is a smooth function of the contact line speed, are reported. Contact-line dissipation originating from the contact-line speed condition leads to damping for drops with finite contact-line mobility, even for inviscid fluids. The critical mobility and associated driving frequency to generate the largest contact-line dissipation is computed. Viscous dissipation is approximated using the irrotational flow and the critical Ohnesorge number bounding regions beyond which a given mode becomes over-damped is computed. Regions of modal coexistence where two modes can be simultaneously excited by a single forcing frequency are identified. Predictions compare favorably to related experiments on vibrated drops.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1744-683X	1744-6848		WOS:000387988400013	27722622	
J	Popp, Collin J; Tisch, Jocelyn J; Sakarcan, Kenan E; Bridges, William C; Jesch, Elliot D								Approximate Time to Steady-state Resting Energy Expenditure Using Indirect Calorimetry in Young, Healthy Adults.								Frontiers in nutrition				3				49	49					2016	2016	Indirect calorimetry (IC) measurements to estimate resting energy expenditure (REE) necessitate a stable measurement period or steady state (SS). There is limited evidence when assessing the time to reach SS in young, healthy adults. The aims of this prospective study are to determine the approximate time to necessary reach SS using open-circuit IC and to establish the appropriate duration of SS needed to estimate REE. One hundred young, healthy participants (54 males and 46 females; age=20.6±2.1years; body weight=73.6±16.3kg; height 172.5±9.3cm; BMI=24.5±3.8kg/m(2)) completed IC measurement for approximately 30min while the volume of oxygen (VO2) and volume of carbon dioxide (VCO2) were collected. SS was defined by variations in the VO2 and VCO2 of ≤10% coefficient of variation (%CV) over a period of five consecutive minutes. The 30-min IC measurement was divided into six 5-min segments, such as S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, and S6. The results show that SS was achieved during S2 (%CV=6.81±3.2%), and the %CV continued to met the SS criteria for the duration of the IC measurement (S3=8.07±4.4%, S4=7.93±3.7%, S5=7.75±4.1%, and S6=8.60±4.6%). The current study found that in a population of young, healthy adults the duration of the IC measurement period could be a minimum of 10min. The first 5-min segment was discarded, while SS occurred by the second 5-min segment.									0	0	0	0	0	0						MEDLINE:27857943	27857943

Many of these facilities, such as offshore wind farms, are located in high moisture environment. For these facilities, high impedance fault such as water tree becomes a potential hazard in cable maintenance, particular in long distance cables. In this paper, a method is proposed for real time monitoring of potential water tree appearance in the long distance cable. The early warning system assesses the possibility of water tree presence using naturally occurring high frequency waves in the system. The response of the high frequency wave is subjected to an extrapolation-comparison method. The early warning system determines if the pulse response contains deviations indicating potential water tree presence. The system process is demonstrated through a 3 kHz pulse. The response for the proposed system is observed.

IEEE					PMU Deployment Approach for Maximum Observability Considering its Potential Loss								2016 IEEE/PES TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION CONFERENCE AND EXPOSITION (T&D)														2016	2016	Deploying a limited number of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) into the system to get full buses observability considering disturbance like communication failure, line outages is quite a challenging task. This paper proposes a possible problem solving approach by optimizing PMU location for obtaining maximum buses observability even when considering the potential loss of PMUs. With the knowledge of optimal PMU placement for topological observability under normal operating condition, the proposed method requires the number of PMUs to be one greater than the minimal requirement. The implemented model further considers conventional measurements for economic solution. The proposed approach is applied in four IEEE test systems including 2383 western polish to testify its effectiveness. The optimized deployment scheme also verifies the ability of approach to maximize the observable buses by installed PMUs.

An excellent technique evolution uses to handle this tension is the creation of "stealth diversity," which does not affect the population until and unless it is adaptively useful. Colonies are a uniquely powerful way to do this, since they simultaneously eliminate the conservative influence of gene flow while posing new challenges that redirect selection. Turner's classic analysis of the interplay between the East coast and frontier cultures of the American west echoes these themes within the context of cultural evolution. As any colonial culture evolves, the mother culture attempts to exert a conservative influence, creating tension and reinforcing divergence. Nevertheless, if the colony survives, it can generate adaptive diversity that is as valuable to the mother culture as it was inaccessible to her on her own. Thus, American style democracy blossomed on the frontier, but eventually cross-pollinated with the mother culture and beyond, greatly enriching world culture. Since the conditions on an extraterrestrial colony will be fundamentally different from those shaping terrestrial ones, we can't predict their evolutionary trajectory in detail. However, the development of extraterrestrial colonies will certainly create additional adaptive diversity that could be critical to our long-term success as a species. Colonies should therefore be pursued, not as a means to particular cultural ends, but as experiments in cultural adaptation. Moreover, we must be open-minded about the fruits of these experiments, since our pretensions to universality are often little more than an instinctive conservatism that does not reflect the realities of colonial circumstances. Indeed, most arguments against the establishment of extraterrestrial colonies partake of either extremely short-term thinking or an unfounded degree of confidence in the capacity of terrestrial culture to adapt unaided. Therefore, any truly rational, long-term, strategic plan for humanity must include an aggressive program of extraterrestrial colonization.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2199-3882		978-3-319-29349-3; 978-3-319-29347-9	WOS:000386454600014

This paper identifies eleven design-based "enablers" (strategies) for creating adaptable buildings that are resistant to obsolescence. The perceived effectiveness of the enablers was studied through a survey of design professionals. Statistical analyses of the survey results were conducted to compare responses between different groups of design professionals. While the results are considered preliminary, they do suggest that some of the enablers are viewed as being significantly more effective than the others. Further work in quantitative modeling of building adaptability is to follow, as we hope to promote sustainability by empowering designers with tools that can best enable the adaptive reuse of buildings.

Recently the visibility of pipe failures has increased with social media and 24-hour news coverage. In response, many utilities have adapted pipe asset management strategies to reduce failures. Also, many technologies have emerged that allow for a more proactive pipe asset management. As sustainability has become a focus for many organizations including utilities, the question becomes which pipe asset management strategy is most sustainable. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate three pipe asset management strategies for sustainability using Envision (R). The strategies include: a reactive run-to-failure and then replace; a preemptive replacement prior to failure based on assumed condition; and a balanced approach of active condition assessment and action based on the known condition. Envision (R) will be used to evaluate each approach to determine its sustainability rating. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

By identifying and manipulating the mathematical functions that govern the resulting natural form, this research explores how built structures can best capture the fundamental functions of an organism. Studying an organism's form, processes, and habitat can lead to the development of structures that are able to adapt to changing trends and standards over time. An example is provided from the authors' current project, which involves structurally modeling the Turritella terebra seashell and conducting parametric studies to determine which of its characteristics allow for its adaptability.

A combined finite-element/discrete-particle analysis of a side-vent-channel-based concept for improved blast-survivability of light tactical vehicles								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY				7	1			106	141		10.1108/IJSI-12-2014-0068			2016	2016	Purpose - The recently proposed concept solution for improving blast-survivability of the light tactical military vehicles is critically assessed using combined finite-element/discrete-particle computational methods and tools. The purpose of this paper is to propose a concept that involves the use of side-vent-channels attached to the V-shaped vehicle underbody. Since the solution does not connect the bottom and the roof or pass through the cabin of a light tactical vehicle, this solution is not expected to: first, reduce the available cabin space; second, interfere with the vehicle occupants' ability to scout the surroundings; and third, compromise the vehicle's off-road structural durability/reliability. Furthermore, the concept solution attempts to exploit ideas and principles of operation of the so-called "pulse detonation" rocket engines in order to create a downward thrust on the targeted vehicle.Design/methodology/approach - To maximize the downward thrust effects and minimize the extent of vehicle upward movement, standard engineering-optimization methods and tools are employed for the design of side-vent-channels.Findings - The results obtained confirmed the beneficial effects of the side-vent-channels in reducing the blast momentum, although the extent of these effects is relatively small (3-4 percent).Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, the present work is the first public-domain report of the side-vent-channel blast-mitigation concept.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1757-9864	1757-9872		WOS:000387148800006

This approach is generally quite costly and time-consuming and, hence, new (faster and more economical) approaches are needed for the development of high-performance armor-grade composite materials. One of these new approaches is the so-called materials-by-design approach. Within this approach, extensive use is made of the computer-aided engineering (CAE) analyses and of the empirically/theoretically established functional relationships between an armor-grade composite-protected structure, the properties of the composite materials, material microstructure (as characterized at different length-scales) and the material/structure synthesis and fabrication processes. The paper aims to discuss these issues.Design/methodology/approach - In the present work, a first step is made toward applying the materials-by-design approach to the development of the armor-grade composite materials and protective structures with superior ballistic-penetration resistance. Specifically, CAE analyses are utilized to establish functional relationships between the attributes/properties of the composite material and the penetration resistance of the associated protective structure, and to identify the combination of these properties which maximize the penetration resistance. In a follow-up paper, the materials-by-design approach will be extended to answer the questions such as what microstructural features the material must possess in order for the penetration resistance to be maximized and how such materials should be synthesized/processed.Findings - The results obtained show that proper adjustment of the material properties results in significant improvements in the protective structure penetration resistance.Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, the present work is the first reported attempt to apply the materials-by-design approach to armor-grade composite materials in order to help improve their ballistic-penetration resistance.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1757-9864	1757-9872		WOS:000387148800007

Process and product-performance modeling for mechanical fastening by flow drilling screws								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY				7	3			370	396		10.1108/IJSI-03-2015-0011			2016	2016	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a computational approach to establish the effect of various flow drilling screw (FS) process and material parameters on the quality and the mechanical performance of the resulting FS joints.Design/methodology/approach - Toward that end, a sequence of three distinct computational analyses is developed. These analyses include: (a) finite-element modeling and simulations of the FS process; (b) determination of the mechanical properties of the resulting FS joints through the use of three-dimensional, continuum finite-element-based numerical simulations of various mechanical tests performed on the FS joints; and (c) determination, parameterization and validation of the constitutive relations for the simplified FS connectors, using the results obtained in (b) and the available experimental results. The availability of such connectors is mandatory in large-scale computational analyses of whole-vehicle crash or even in simulations of vehicle component manufacturing, e.g. car-body electro-coat paint-baking process. In such simulations, explicit three-dimensional representation of all FS joints is associated with a prohibitive computational cost.Findings - Virtual testing of the shell components fastened using the joint connectors validated the ability of these line elements to realistically account for the strength, ductility and toughness of the three-dimensional FS joints.Originality/value - The approach developed in the present work can be used, within an engineering-optimization procedure, to adjust the FS process and material parameters (design variables) in order to obtain a desired combination of the FS-joint mechanical properties (objective function).									0	0	0	0	0	0			1757-9864	1757-9872		WOS:000387149300003

The purpose of this paper is to carry out combined experimental and numerical investigations of the mechanical properties of materials residing in different weld zones of FSW joints of thick AA2139-T8 plates.Design/methodology/approach - Within the experimental investigation, the following has been conducted: first, optical-microscopy characterization of the transverse sections of the FSW joints, in order to help identify and delineate weld zones; second, micro hardness field generation over the same transverse section in order to reconfirm the location and the extent of various weld zones; third, extraction of miniature tensile specimens from different weld zones and their experimental testing; and finally, extraction of a larger size tensile specimen spanning transversely the FSW weld and its testing. Within the computational investigation, an effort was made to: first, validate the mechanical properties obtained using the miniature tensile specimens; and second, demonstrate the need for the use of the miniature tensile specimens.Findings - It is argued that the availability of weld-zone material mechanical properties is critical since: first, these properties are often inferior relative to their base-metal counterparts; second, the width of the weld in thick metallic-armor is often comparable to the armor thickness, and therefore may represent a significant portion of the armor exposed-surface area; and finally, modeling of the weld-material structural response under loading requires the availability of high-fidelity/validated material constitutive models, and the development of such models requires knowledge of the weld-material mechanical properties.Originality/value - The importance of determining the mechanical properties of the material in different parts of the weld zone with sufficient accuracy is demonstrated.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1757-9864	1757-9872		WOS:000387149300006

However, various experimental investigations have shown that armor-grade composites based on 2D-reinforcement architectures tend to display inferior through-the-thickness mechanical properties, compromising their ballistic performance. To overcome this problem, armor-grade composites based on three-dimensional (3D) fiber-reinforcement architectures have recently been investigated experimentally. The paper aims to discuss these issues.Design/methodology/approach - In the present work, continuum-level material models are derived, parameterized and validated for armor-grade composite materials, having four (two 2D and two 3D) prototypical reinforcement architectures based on oriented ultra-high molecular-weight polyethylene fibers. To properly and accurately account for the effect of the reinforcement architecture, the appropriate unit cells (within which the constituent materials and their morphologies are represented explicitly) are constructed and subjected to a series of virtual mechanical tests (VMTs). The results obtained are used within a post-processing analysis to derive and parameterize the corresponding homogenized-material models. One of these models (specifically, the one for 0 degrees/90 degrees cross-collimated fiber architecture) was directly validated by comparing its predictions with the experimental counterparts. The other models are validated by examining their physical soundness and details of their predictions. Lastly, the models are integrated as user-material subroutines, and linked with a commercial finite-element package, in order to carry out a transient non-linear dynamics analysis of ballistic transverse impact of armor-grade composite-material panels with different reinforcement architectures.Findings - The results obtained clearly revealed the role the reinforcement architecture plays in the overall ballistic limit of the armor panel, as well as in its structural and damage/failure response.Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, the present work is the first reported attempt to assess, computationally, the utility and effectiveness of 3D fiber-reinforcement architectures for ballistic-impact applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1757-9864	1757-9872		WOS:000387149500001

Since traumatic brain injury experienced by a significant fraction of the soldiers returning from the recent conflicts is associated with their exposure to blast, the ACH should be redesigned in order to provide the necessary level of protection against blast loads. In the present work, augmentations of the ACH for improved blast protections are considered. These augmentations include the use of a polyurea (a nano-segregated elastomeric copolymer)-based ACH external coating/internal lining.Design/methodology/approach - To demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, instrumented (unprotected, standard-ACH-protected, and augmented-ACH-protected) head-mannequin blast experiments are carried out. These experimental efforts are complemented with the appropriate combined Eulerian/Lagrangian transient non-linear dynamics computational fluid/solid interaction analysis.Findings - The results obtained indicated that: when the extent of peak over-pressure reduction is used as a measure of the blast-mitigation effectiveness, polyurea-based augmentations do not noticeably improve, and sometimes slightly worsen, the performance of the standard ACH; when the extent of specific impulse reduction is used as a measure of the blast-mitigation effectiveness, application of the polyurea external coating to the standard ACH improves the blast-mitigation effectiveness of the helmet, particularly at shorter values of the charge-detonation standoff distance (SOD). At longer SODs, the effects of the polyurea-based ACH augmentations on the blast-mitigation efficacy of the standard ACH are inconclusive; and the use of the standard ACH significantly lowers the accelerations experienced by the skull and the intracranial matter. As far as the polyurea-based augmentations are concerned, only the internal lining at shorter SODs appears to yield additional reductions in the head accelerations.Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, the present work contains the first report of a combined experimental/computational study addressing the problem of blast-mitigation by polyurea-based augmentation of ACH.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1757-9864	1757-9872		WOS:000387149500003

Identifying the perceived value of statistical consulting in a university setting								JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL THEORY AND PRACTICE				10	1			216	225		10.1080/15598608.2015.1108254			2016	2016	The aim of this study was to examine the perceived value of statistical consulting among statisticians within a university setting. Surveys were administered to statisticians at land-grant institutions, at known universities with consulting centers, and from the American Statistical Association Section on Statistical Consulting, to identify their perceptions on how statistical consulting is and should be valued within the university setting. Comparisons between consulting statisticians within and not within established consulting centers were examined. The results of the study provide evidence of the value of statistical consulting services to help inform university administrators and faculty review committees. Awareness of the value of consulting activities encourages collaborative efforts in the scientific community.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1559-8608	1559-8616		WOS:000386797800014

Perceptions of tourism revenue sharing impacts on Volcanoes National Park, Rwanda: a Sustainable Livelihoods framework								JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM				24	12			1709	1726		10.1080/09669582.2016.1145228			2016	2016	Tourism revenue sharing (TRS) has become a popular strategy for integrated wildlife conservation and rural development in Africa. In Rwanda, 5% of tourism revenue is invested annually in communities adjacent to protected areas. However, the conservation impact of the TRS strategy has been challenged. Previous studies have revealed structural constraints of TRS, which partially explain TRS shortfalls. The TRS application is complex and needs deeper understanding of both conceptual and structural constraints. In this paper, we examine local perceptions of TRS, and use the Sustainable Livelihoods framework to conceptually understand the livelihood capability, equity and sustainability constraints of TRS at Volcanoes National Park (VNP). Results suggest that TRS has had minimal conservation impact due to acute food insecurity and limited livelihood capabilities among the poorest residents in proximity to VNP. This is exacerbated by several TRS structural constraints, such as the association membership fee requirement for TRS benefits, political influence, poor conservation linkages, and limited participation of the most socially and economically disadvantaged residents in proximity to VNP. This paper recommends restructuring of the TRS decision-making process to ensure consideration of both short-term and long-term conservation goals, wildlife conservation linkages and participation of the most economically disadvantaged residents in proximity to the park boundary.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0966-9582	1747-7646		WOS:000387293300008

IEEE					An Efficient Wireless Power Transfer System To Balance the State of Charge of Electric Vehicles								PROCEEDINGS 45TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PARALLEL PROCESSING - ICPP 2016		Proceedings of the International Conference on Parallel Processing						324	333		10.1109/ICPP.2016.44			2016	2016	As an alternate form in the road transportation system, electric vehicle (EV) can help reduce the fossil-fuel consumption. However, the usage of EVs is constrained by the limited capacity of battery. Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) can increase the driving range of EVs by charging EVs in-motion when they drive through a wireless charging lane embedded in a road. The amount of power that can be supplied by a charging lane at a time is limited. A problem here is when a large number of EVs pass a charging lane, how to efficiently distribute the power among different penetrations levels of EVs? However, there has been no previous research devoted to tackling this challenge. To handle this challenge, we propose a system to balance the State of Charge (called BSoC) among the EVs. It consists of three components: i) fog-based power distribution architecture, ii) power scheduling model, and iii) efficient vehicle-to-fog communication protocol. The fog computing center collects information from EVs and schedules the power distribution. We use fog closer to vehicles rather than cloud in order to reduce the communication latency. The power scheduling model schedules the power allocated to each EV. In order to avoid network congestion between EVs and the fog, we let vehicles choose their own communication channel to communicate with local controllers. Finally, we evaluate our system using extensive simulation studies in Network Simulator-3, MatLab, and Simulation for Urban MObility tools, and the experimental results confirm the efficiency of our system.					45th International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP)45th International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP)	AUG 16-19, 2016AUG 16-19, 2016	Int Assoc Comp & Commun; IEEE Comp SocInt Assoc Comp & Commun; IEEE Comp Soc	Philadelphia, PAPhiladelphia, PA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0190-3918		978-1-5090-2823-8	WOS:000387089600037		
S	Chen, Kang; Shen, Haiying			IEEE					MobiSensing: Exploiting Human Mobility for Multi-Application Mobile Data Sensing with Low User Intervention								PROCEEDINGS 45TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PARALLEL PROCESSING - ICPP 2016		Proceedings of the International Conference on Parallel Processing						490	495		10.1109/ICPP.2016.63			2016	2016	The explosive growth of personal mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and pads) has brought about significant potential distributed sensing resources. However, such resources have not been fully utilized due to two problems: i) mobile device mobility usually is not dedicated to data sensing, and ii) users may not be willing to participate in the data sensing proactively, i.e., move to or wait in a specific area. To address these problems, we propose a sensing system, namely MobiSensing, with a low intervention to device owners. It uses the semi-Markov process to model node mobility for future mobility prediction. While moving around, mobile devices connect to the central task assignment server opportunistically through their owners' daily usage. In each connection, the server predicts the connected device's next connection and its mobility between current and the next connection. Then, the server assigns sensing tasks in this period of time that the node is likely to complete to the node. As a result, no proactive operations or movements are required for device owners, and sensing tasks can be completed passively and efficiently. Trace-driven experiments demonstrate the high successful rate of MobiSensing.					45th International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP)45th International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP)	AUG 16-19, 2016AUG 16-19, 2016	Int Assoc Comp & Commun; IEEE Comp SocInt Assoc Comp & Commun; IEEE Comp Soc	Philadelphia, PAPhiladelphia, PA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0190-3918		978-1-5090-2823-8	WOS:000387089600056

To cope with this reality, it is necessary to understand how power bounds impact the design and performance of emergent computer systems.In this paper, we study the problem of coordinated power allocation between processors and memory modules on power-bounded systems. We experimentally and analytically investigate the dynamics between cross-component power allocation and application performance, identify the patterns of power allocation scenarios, and develop optimal power allocation methods.In our study, we discover that (1) different applications share categorical patterns with regard to how power allocations among individual components impact application performance and actual power; (2) the per-node power budget must exceed a certain threshold in order to achieve desirable performance and efficiency; (3) there exist workload-specific optimal power allocations under a given power budget and such optimal power coordination can be pinpointed using the heuristics derived from the categorical patterns and a light-weight power-performance profiling. Results from this study demonstrate the importance and feasibility of cross-component coordination to the implementation of power-bound high performance computing technology.					45th International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP)45th International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP)	AUG 16-19, 2016AUG 16-19, 2016	Int Assoc Comp & Commun; IEEE Comp SocInt Assoc Comp & Commun; IEEE Comp Soc	Philadelphia, PAPhiladelphia, PA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0190-3918		978-1-5090-2823-8	WOS:000387089600059

Cooperative control is directly affected by the communication strategy adopted for exchanging information, which makes the overall system analysis and design complicated. We build a swarm robotic platform that is simple enough for undergraduate students to study cooperative control, yet flexible enough to incorporate complicated control and communication strategies. The robotic platform is a seamless integration of Arduino Uno microcontrollers, iRobot Create 2 which is capable to emulate various holonomous and nonholonomous vehicles, and RF communication modules which are capable of exchanging information with extreme simplicity and low latency.

Current state of the art in AWS estimates wavenumber based on the maximum data fit of the wavenumber dispersion curve and derives thickness deterministically through the Lamb wave equations. Successful determination of thickness from the measurements through inverse analysis is dependent upon two aspects: uncertainties regarding material properties of the system (parametric uncertainty) and uncertainties regarding data collected in the field under less than ideal conditions (experimental uncertainty). Thus, the deterministic approach may lead to large false positives in the presence of parametric and experimental uncertainties. The focus of this paper is to develop a stochastic approach for inferring thickness from the measurements in which both parametric and experimental uncertainties are accounted for. Herein, parametric uncertainty is managed by calibrating material-dependent properties using wavenumber measurements. Experimental uncertainty is controlled through incorporation of expert judgment by means of an elicited prior uncertainty of thickness. The technological advancement produced in this study is demonstrated on a case study application of an aluminum plate with imposed thinning.					34th IMAC Conference and Exposition on Structural Dynamics34th IMAC Conference and Exposition on Structural Dynamics	JAN 25-28, 2016JAN 25-28, 2016	Soc Experimental MechSoc Experimental Mech	Orlando, FLOrlando, FL	0	0	0	0	0	0			2191-5644		978-3-319-30084-9; 978-3-319-30083-2	WOS:000387431500010

To describe original samples' surface physical and chemical characteristics, X-ray fluorescence (XRF), Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (FAAS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscope and Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (SEM-EDS) and TG-DTA were used. Then, used XRD and SEM-EDS to describe the system features and characterization of the anode slime performed by Washing-Roasting. Through application of XRF and FAAS, element content in anode slime and the source of each element were analyzed. The results show that the original samples of anode slime mainly contains Mn, Pb, Ca, Se and Sr and averagely the contents of manganese and lead are 47% and 7.46%, respectively. XRD analysis shows that main phases of the anode slime are KxMn(8)O(16), MnO2, PbMn8O16 and Pb2Mn8O16, and MnO2 in the slime has a mixed crystal structure of alpha-MnO2, beta-MnO2, gamma-MnO2, delta-MnO2. SEM-EDS analysis indicates that the anode slime has dense "mineral" phase. TG-DTA/DTG analysis shows that at the temperature of 0 similar to 573 degrees C, water in delta -MnO2 lattice is desorbed; 573 similar to 655 degrees C, MnO2 starts to lose oxygen and turn into Mn2O3; 900 similar to 1000 degrees C Mn2O3 loses oxygen and turn into Mn3O4. Anode slime under different roasting temperature were characterized by XRD and SEM-EDS. The result shows that when roasting temperature reaches higher than 700 degrees C, bond energy of Pb-O is broken; when higher than 800 degrees C, the crystallinity of anode slime further increases and the dense structure of anode slime is broken, which provides an effective way to remove lead from the slime; when higher than 900 degrees C, Mn2O3 turns into Mn3O4 and the channels in the anode slime become much looser and wider for better leaching of impurity ions.

J	Bain, Lisa J; Liu, Jui-Tung; League, Ryan E								Arsenic inhibits stem cell differentiation by altering the interplay between the Wnt3a and Notch signaling pathways.								Toxicology reports				3				405	413					2016	2016	Millions of people are exposed to arsenic through their drinking water and food, but the mechanisms by which it impacts embryonic development are not well understood. Arsenic exposure during embryogenesis is associated with neurodevelopmental effects, reduced weight gain, and altered locomotor activity, and in vitro data indicates that arsenic exposure inhibits stem cell differentiation. This study investigated whether arsenic disrupted the Wnt3a signaling pathway, critical in the formation of myotubes and neurons, during the differentiation in P19 mouse embryonic stem cells. Cells were exposed to 0, 0.1, or 0.5 muM arsenite, with or without exogenous Wnt3a, for up to 9 days of differentiation. Arsenic exposure alone inhibits the differentiation of stem cells into neurons and skeletal myotubes, and reduces the expression of both beta-catenin and GSK3beta mRNA to ~55% of control levels. Co-culture of the arsenic-exposed cells with exogenous Wnt3a rescues the morphological phenotype, but does not alter transcript, protein, or phosphorylation status of GSK3beta or beta-catenin. However, arsenic exposure maintains high levels of Hes5 and decreases the expression of MASH1 by 2.2-fold, which are anti- and pro-myogenic and neurogenic genes, respectively, in the Notch signaling pathway. While rescue with exogenous Wnt3a reduced Hes5 levels, MASH1 levels stay repressed. Thus, while Wnt3a can partially rescue the inhibition of differentiation from arsenic, it does so by also modulating Notch target genes rather than only working through the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. These results indicate that arsenic alters the interplay between multiple signaling pathways, leading to reduced stem cell differentiation.									0	0	0	0	0	0						MEDLINE:27158593	27158593

Consequently, demand for high power quality and voltage stability becomes a pressing issue. Dynamic voltage restorer (DVR), as a custom power device, is one of the most effective solutions for "restoring" the quality of voltage at its load-side terminals when the quality of voltage at its source-side terminals is disturbed. In this paper, a new DVR topology based on double flying capacitor multicell (DFCM) converter for medium-voltage application has been proposed. The advantage of the proposed DVR is that it does not need any line-frequency step-up isolation transformer, which is bulky and costly, to be connected to medium-voltage power grid. The proposed DVR topology obtains the required active power from the energy storage feeding the dc link of the DFCM converter. The pre-sag compensation method, which is explained in detail, is used to restore amplitude and angle of the sensitive load voltage. Moreover, an approach based on d-q synchronous reference frame to determine DVR reference voltages is utilized The proposed DVR topology is simulated and results to illustrate its performance under various conditions of voltage sag compensation are provided.

Increasing penetration of intermittent sources of alternative generation compromises reliability and introduces significant price volatility. As a solution, demand response strategies have been studied to provide the necessary demand-side flexibility for utility to absorb some volatility. In this paper, a demand-response management (DRM) system is proposed, where a service provider finds a mutual optimal solution for the utility and the customers in a microgrid setting. This could be used by a service provider interacting with the respective customers and utility under the existence of some DRM agreements. In this study, a micro grid consisting of a smart neighbourhood of twelve customers is taken as experimental case study and an advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) is implemented. Based on the formulation of an optimization problem which exploits price-responsive demand flexibility and the AMI infrastructure, a win-win-win strategy is presented. By shaping load patterns according to market pricing, the proposed method led to higher cost savings for the flexible customers and the utility, with consistent profit margins achieved by the service provider. Results for a range of typical scenarios are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed demand-response management framework.

IEEE					Low-Voltage Dc Testbed Design for a Z-Source breaker based protection Scheme								2016 CLEMSON UNIVERSITY POWER SYSTEMS CONFERENCE (PSC)		Clemson University Power Systems Conference												2016	2016	The need to develop a protection scheme has been one of the main focus points of recent research in dc grid technology. Z-source breakers are a relatively new invention in this field. Considerable research on the z-source breaker has been focused on its optimum design rather than control. In a single load / single source system these breakers do not need a complicated control. Recently a control scheme has been proposed for z-source breakers in an MVDC ring architecture with multiple loads and sources. This paper discusses design of a low-voltage dc system that can be used as a testbed for that z-source breaker protection scheme. For ease of implementation, the construction of this system has been broken down into three stages. During each stage a different aspect of the system and the breaker's performance will be observed and tested. Also, a prototype enclosure for z-source breaker is designed and initial testing results are presented. The breaker box has been assembled in a very generic way so it can be installed into any test bed with similar power levels. The control scheme requires all the breakers to communicate with a central control. This paper discusses some processing and communication solutions for the small range lab environment and proposes a scheme for setting up that network.

Ashfaqur; Venayagamoorthy, Ganesh Kumar			IEEE					Dishonest Gauss Newton Method Based Power System State Estimation on a GPU								2016 CLEMSON UNIVERSITY POWER SYSTEMS CONFERENCE (PSC)		Clemson University Power Systems Conference												2016	2016	To control a fast changing power system in real time, it is important to accelerate the computation processes related to it. Being one of the most time-consuming processes, state estimation needs to be made fast and scalable. Different methods were introduced in the literature over time to serve the purpose. It is high time to make the best out of them to find the fastest estimator with current parallel computation technology. In this study, the dishonest Gauss Newton method is implemented in a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). As the method is not well explored in the literature, the performance of it is investigated first. Then different aspects of the parallel implementation is explained. It runs in hundreds of microseconds for IEEE 118-bus systems which is the fastest according to the authors findings. For very large systems, the required configuration of a GPU and the corresponding time are also estimated.

There are several modified configurations of SMCs presented in literatures. Reduced SMC is the most advanced one whose pros are reduced amount of flying capacitor causing to reduce the size and cost of SMC. This paper proposes a reduced SMC based dual function DVR which works in two modes of voltage compensator (VC) as well as fault current limiter (FCL). In the mode of VC, DVR injects required amount of voltage to restore the quality of voltage at the sensitive load side while it injects such amount of voltage to act as like as controllable inductor to increase series impedance of grid virtually. The control strategy of dual-function DVR as VC and FCL is explained and new short-circuit fault detection method is presented. Moreover, the simulation results of dual-function DVR based on the 4 cell 9-level reduced SMC are presented.

IEEE					Benders' Decomposition Applied to Energy Resource Management in Smart Distribution Networks								2016 CLEMSON UNIVERSITY POWER SYSTEMS CONFERENCE (PSC)		Clemson University Power Systems Conference												2016	2016	This paper proposes a Benders' decomposition approach for the large-scale Energy Resource Management (ERM). The problem considers large amount of Distributed Energy Resources (DER) including Electric Vehicles (EVs) with gridable capacity. The proposed model is designed for Virtual Power Players/Plants (VPPs) managing a smart distribution network with the aim to maximize profits considering the day ahead time horizon. Previous literature has shown difficulties in solving similar problems using classical techniques in a centralized scheme, namely considering nonlinear network constrains. The proposed approach reduces computational burden of the original Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem. The Benders' cuts are introduced for the ERM formulation in order to allow the communication between the slave and the master problem. Analysis of two large-scale instances have been carried out for smart distribution networks, namely a 33-bus and a real Portuguese 180-bus network assuming high penetration of DERs and EVs.

IEEE					Virtual Generators based Damping Controller for a Multi-machine Power System Using mu-Synthesis								2016 CLEMSON UNIVERSITY POWER SYSTEMS CONFERENCE (PSC)		Clemson University Power Systems Conference												2016	2016	Inter-area oscillations are frequently observed in a multi-area power system; these oscillations are impacted by different contingencies and operating conditions, and occur with multiple modes. As a result, the consideration of robustness is essential during the design of damping controllers. In order to simultaneously satisfy the requirement of Robust Stability (RS) and Robust Performance (RP) for damping. A mu-synthesis based damping controller that uses Virtual Generator (VG) speeds to characterize oscillation patterns and to implement excitation control is developed in this study. The mu-controller ensures robust performance to power system modeling inaccuracy and to a wide range of operating conditions. Real-time simulation is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the mu-controller.

The switches considered here were designed to evaluate fault ride-through capabilities for megawatt scale wind turbine generators and other generators with grid-connected stators. It is shown in the paper that, if left unchecked, high-frequency harmonics inherent in the output of inverter-based voltage sources can produce failures in the snubber circuits of AC switches. A case study is presented to analyze this issue, and different solutions are analyzed and implemented to tackle the problem.

IEEE					Dynamic Performance Enhancement of a Utility-Scale Solar PV Plant								2016 IEEE PES POWERAFRICA CONFERENCE								26	30					2016	2016	Recent studies on Power Electronic Interfaces (PEI) demonstrate that enhanced performance of a PEI can be achieved through optimal tuning of its controller parameters. As an example nowadays, voltage source converters (VSC) are extensively utilized as the interface between DC energy sources and the power system. Photovoltaic (PV) inverters have emerged as one of the most indispensable and widely utilized components in smart grid operations. Considering the complexity, costliness, and possible ineffectuality of PEI conventional manual tuning processes, an automated controller self-tuning approach has been proposed through harnessing the capabilities of particle swarm optimization (PSO), a heuristic optimization method. The multi-megawatt solar PV-plant has been connected to a benchmark two-area four-machine power system. The entire system is simulated using a real-time digital simulator (RTDS). The solar PV plant enhanced performance in conjunction to both improved steady-state and dynamic operation of each of its voltage source inverters (PV-VSI) concludes the effectiveness and benefits of the proposed tuning approach. This enables smoother renewable energy integration, reliable delivery of energy at a lower cost, and further reduced carbon footprints worldwide.

IEEE					Optimal Tuning of Governors on Synchronous Generators in a Multi-Area Power System with a Large Photovoltaic Plant								2016 IEEE PES POWERAFRICA CONFERENCE								246	250					2016	2016	The integration of renewables, such as solar and wind power, introduces new challenges for existing multi-area power system operations. These variable generation sources are transforming the grid into a more dynamic system which significantly affects real-time operation. With dynamic generation, supply and demand will deviate frequently over time causing severe frequency fluctuations. The generators on the grid must respond rapidly to these fluctuations in order to stabilize the system and ultimately return to nominal frequency. In this paper, a 210 MW photovoltaic (PV) plant is integrated into a two-area four-machine power system. Due to the output variations of the PV plant, especially during cloudy conditions, the system frequency will significantly fluctuate. The objective of this paper is the optimal tuning of governors on synchronous generators in order to damp and mitigate frequency deviations as fast as possible. The governor parameters are tuned using a heuristic optimization method to provide the least number of frequency events and minimum frequency deviation with varying penetration levels of PV power. With optimally tuned governor parameters, a multi-area power system can operate reliably while maximizing the utilization of clean power generation sources.

It emerges as an effective way to solve traffic congestion, parking space tension and air pollution resulting from vehicle emissions. One of the challenges that restrict widespread adoption of carpool commuting lies in matching carpoolers. Existing carpooler matching methods include building carpool lanes in main airports and bus stops, using centralized servers to identify carpoolers based on historical travel data or real time travel requests. However, these methods cannot be applied to large scale adoption or incur long matching latency. To overcome drawbacks of existing methods, we propose VShare, a dynamic carpool system that leverages the wireless social network characteristic and hierarchical cloud server architecture. VShare incorporates two design components: matching through the wireless social network and a hierarchical cloud server structure. Upon receiving a user travel request, VShare first identifies possible carpoolers from neighbors in nearby locations, which reduces latency of sending travel requests to remote servers. If no carpool is found within nearby locations, a hierarchical cloud server architecture is used to match the travel requests. We have implemented the design of VShare and conducted trace-driven experiments. Experimental results show the effectiveness of VShare in substantially reducing matching latency while providing high success rate in matching carpollers.

Current routing methods either have limited routing efficiency or need the help of centralized infrastructures to improve the routing performance, which is deviated from the goal of building VDTNs without centralized infrastructures. In this paper, we propose a DIstributed Adaptive-Learning routing method for VDTNs, namely DIAL, by taking advantage of the human beings' communication feature, that is, most interactions are generated by pairs of people who interacted often previously. DIAL consists of two components: the information fusion based routing method and the adaptive-learning framework. The information fusion based routing method enables DIAL to improve the routing performance by sharing and fusing multiple kinds of routing information without centralized infrastructures. Furthermore, based on the information shared by information fusion based routing method, the adaptive-learning framework enables DIAL to design personalized routing strategies for different vehicle pairs without centralized infrastructures. Therefore, DIAL can not only share and fuse multiple kinds of routing information of each vehicle without centralized infrastructures, but also design a personalized routing strategy for each vehicle pair. Extensive trace-driven simulation demonstrates that DIAL has better routing success rate and shorter average delay in comparison with state-of-the-art routing methods, which need the help of centralized infrastructures in VDTNs.

Almost every modern system for automated verification demands that programmers annotate their code with assertions, such as invariants to facilitate automation. But many learners struggle to grasp how to arrive at an assertion that remains an invariant and is sufficiently strong to prove subsequent assertions reliant on the outcome of the loop. The objective of this research is to present a method to help understand the difficulties students face in developing suitable loop invariants, and assist them in the process. We describe results from an experimentation in a software engineering classroom where students were charged with developing verified component-based code using a web-based front end for a verifying compiler. We collected data in the background as students attempted to produce verified code with loop invariants in in-class activities and take-home projects. Initial results show what kinds of information we can expect to see and what kinds of feedback might be useful.					29th IEEE Conference on Software Engineering Education and Training (CSEE&T)29th IEEE Conference on Software Engineering Education and Training (CSEE&T)	APR 05-06, 2016APR 05-06, 2016	IEEE; IEEE Comp Soc; Reliabil SocIEEE; IEEE Comp Soc; Reliabil Soc	Dallas, TXDallas, TX	0	0	0	0	0	0			1093-0175		978-1-5090-0765-3	WOS:000386327400008

VEnvI is an application in which students learn computer science concepts through the process of choreographing movement for a virtual character using a fun and intuitive interface. In this exploratory study, 54 participants as part of a summer camp geared towards promoting participation of women in science and engineering programmatically crafted a dance performance for a virtual human. A subset of those students (16) participated in an immersive embodied interaction metaphor in VEnvI. In creating this metaphor that provides first-person, embodied experiences using self-avatars, we seek to facilitate engagement, excitement and interest in computational thinking. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated the extent to which the activities of the summer camp, programming the dance moves, and the embodied interaction within VEnvI facilitated students' edutainment, presence, interest, excitement, and engagement in computing, and the potential to alter their perceptions of computing and computer scientists. Results indicate that students enjoyed the experience and successfully engaged the virtual character in the immersive embodied interaction, thus exhibiting high telepresence and social presence. Students also showed increased interest and excitement regarding the computing field at the end of their summer camp experience using VEnvI.

An experiment compared responses to three versions of a bullying scenario in which users (N = 78) were placed in the perspective of a bystander: customized VR, non-customized VR, and video. Measures included empathy, attitudes toward bullying victims and bullying, anticipated future behavior, presence, and other perceptions of bullying. The only significant effects observed were on feelings of empathy, with scores in the video condition higher than in the other two conditions, and on perceptions of bullying as a problem in participants' schools, again with scores highest in the video condition. These results were further explored in a follow-up qualitative focus group study (N = 10). Findings from both studies suggest that to elicit empathy-related responses, VR simulations should use photorealistic graphics, employ interactive features, and make customization prominent and carefully tailored. Lessons learned could inform the use of virtual reality in future campaigns.

While these social gatherings provide an opportunity for interaction and new relationships, the environment is often constructed in a manner that reinforces traditional gender roles and increases the overall risk of sexual assaults. For some females, the attainment of status and social acceptance appears to be more important than the risk involved with attendance. The descriptive model presented focuses on the categories of relationships and the risk associated with assimilating into the fraternity party culture.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0163-9625	1521-0456		WOS:000385557500002		
J	Hechavarria, Diana M.; Ingram, Amy E.								The entrepreneurial gender divide Hegemonic masculinity, emphasized femininity and organizational forms								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENDER AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP				8	3			242	281		10.1108/IJGE-09-2014-0029			2016	2016	Purpose - This paper aims to examine the interplay among forms of entrepreneurship and the gendered entrepreneurial divide. Using data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) and the World Values Survey (WVS), the authors investigate the likelihood that females will venture in the commercial entrepreneurial ventures versus social entrepreneurial ventures. The authors draw on the theoretical concept of hegemonic masculinity and emphasized femininity to explain gender variance in the organizational forms of commercial and social entrepreneurship. Specifically, the authors investigate whether pursuing an opportunity in a society that highly values ideologies of hegemonic masculinity and emphasized femininity impacts the probability of venturing in either of these kinds of organizations.Design/methodology/approach - To test the hypotheses, the authors use GEM data from 2009 (n = 14,399) for nascent entrepreneurs and baby businesses owners in 55 counties. They also use the WVS to measure the ideologies of hegemonic masculinity and emphasized femininity at the country level. The authors estimate a logistic multilevel model to identify the drivers of social venturing over commercial venturing. Data are nested by countries, and the authors allow random intercepts by countries with a variance components covariance structure.Findings - The findings demonstrate that there is a divide in entrepreneurial activity, as women entrepreneurs are more likely to start social ventures than commercial ventures. They also find that hegemonic masculinity decreases the incidence of social entrepreneurship, whereas emphasized femininity increases the incidence of social entrepreneurship. Moreover, the authors find evidence that women in societies with a strong view on hegemonic masculinity are less likely to pursue social organizational forms than male entrepreneurs are. Furthermore, in societies with strong views of emphasized femininity, the probability increases that female founders will pursue social organizational forms. The findings highlight the considerable impact of the gender ideologies on entrepreneurship.Research limitations/implications - Although the authors use the terms "gender" and "sex" in this paper interchangeably, they recognize that these two terms are not equivalent. For the purposes of this manuscript, the authors use a gender analysis approach activity based on biological sex to investigate empirical differences in entrepreneurial. The findings suggest that women ultimately, and unintentionally, are consenting to the practices and norms that reiterate the masculinity of entrepreneurship. In this way, the patriarchal ideologies of hegemonic masculinity and masculinization of entrepreneurship ultimately leave women unable to fully take up the identity of "woman" alongside that of "entrepreneur". Future research can build upon our findings by applying a more nuanced view of gender via constructivist approaches.Originality/value - The findings empirically demonstrate the gendered nature of entrepreneurial activity, leading to specific stereotypical female social organizational forms and male commercial organizational forms. Furthermore, the authors are able to provide theoretical explanations based on hegemonic masculinity and emphasized femininity to understand why social entrepreneurship appeals to women.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1756-6266	1756-6274		WOS:000386047700003

Energy efficiency is taken as central property in the design process and it represents a new requirement/property to be defined in the phase of design problem/task definition. In contradiction with established methodologies, the approach includes an initial analysis of existing technical systems and the individuation and classification of their prior and relevant energy consumers (sub-systems and processes). The identified major consumers and processes are afterwards systematically addressed to reduce their energy consumption: interaction of the relay nozzle flow field with the profiled reed. A following analysis step consists in the verification of the system design, predicting and evaluating the system behavior using several tools (e.g. finite element analysis, computational fluid dynamics simulations, experimental analyses, etc.). Since nowadays products become more and more multi-disciplinary by the constantly increasing integration of added functionality and product intelligence and since energy is a global design attribute which is influenced by all disciplines, the development of energy analysis methodologies, both numerical and experimental, able to decrease the environmental impact and to keep constant the machine performance requires an integrated research strategy. Therefore in next air jet weaving machine generations, the design process should move from a purely performance and capacity driven approach to an approach that includes energy efficiency as a key parameter.					3rd International Conference on Sustainable Design and Manufacturing (SDM)3rd International Conference on Sustainable Design and Manufacturing (SDM)	APR 04-06, 2016APR 04-06, 2016	KES Int; Cardiff Univ; Tech Univ CreteKES Int; Cardiff Univ; Tech Univ Crete	Chania, GREECEChania, GREECE	0	0	0	0	0	0			2190-3018		978-3-319-32098-4; 978-3-319-32096-0	WOS:000386325700010

Three maturity classes were defined by an Index of Absorbance Difference (IAD) values (< 0.6, 0.6-0.8, > 0.8). Fruit firmness was positively correlated with maturity class (r=0.308), while soluble solids (SSC) and acidity (TA) showed no difference between fruit of different maturities. SSC/TA ratio, however, showed a negative relationship with the fruit maturity suggesting better taste of more mature fruit. In addition, more mature fruit accumulated higher amounts of bioactive compounds, providing healthier food to the consumers.					29th International Horticultural Congress on Horticulture - Sustaining Lives, Livelihoods and Landscapes (IHC) / International Symposia on Abscission Processes in Horticulture and Non-Destructive Assessment of Fruit Attributes29th International Horticultural Congress on Horticulture - Sustaining Lives, Livelihoods and Landscapes (IHC) / International Symposia on Abscission Processes in Horticulture and Non-Destructive Assessment of Fruit Attributes	AUG 17, 2014AUG 17, 2014	Int Soc Hort SciInt Soc Hort Sci	Brisbane, AUSTRALIABrisbane, AUSTRALIA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-94-62611-17-7	WOS:000386327500027

In the first experiment, five treatments with the following tree evapotranspiration (ETc) requirements and allowable soil water depletion (AD) levels were applied: 1) optimum_PRD_10%_AD (no water on one side, 100% ETc applied on the other side when 10% of the available soil water was depleted), 2) optimum_PRD_30%_AD (no water on one side, 100% ETc applied on the other side at 30% AD), 3) deficit_PRD_10%_AD (no water on one side, 70% ETc applied on the other side at 10% AD), 4) deficit_PRD_30%_AD (no water on one side, 70% ETc applied on the other side at 30% AD), and 5) control (50% ETc on both pots). The irrigated side of the PRD-treated trees was alternated every month. All PRD-treated trees saved between 16 and 36% water compared to control trees. Leaf function and root hydraulic function were similar across treatments. Deficit_PRD_30%_AD trees reduced stem dry weight, but total tree growth and root length in all PRD-treated trees remained unchanged. Whole tree water use efficiency was increased in trees under deficit_PRD_30%_AD, respect to control trees. A second experiment was established to assess water movement between the wet and dry sides of the roots under PRD. Trees were grown under the treatments that maintained stem water potentials above -1.7 MPa in the previous experiment (control, optimum_PRD_10%_AD, deficit_PRD_10%_AD), and their roots in the wet side were immersed in a color dye solution. When available soil water in the wet side was high and root pressure conditions were met, color dye was detected in the roots in the dry side of optimum_PRD_10%_AD, which denotes water movement between the root sides under root pressure conditions.					3rd International Symposium on Citrus Biotechnology3rd International Symposium on Citrus Biotechnology	NOV 11, 2014NOV 11, 2014	Int Soc Horticultural SciInt Soc Horticultural Sci	Shizuoka, JAPANShizuoka, JAPAN	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-94-62611-20-7	WOS:000385237900015

Transparency is often linked with communication in an effort to create an organization that is more informed about decisions and processes creating a sense of employee engagement. But leaders are not able to operate in a completely open manner due to a variety of factors. What leadership activities can be conducted in a transparent manner and how is transparency balanced with confidentiality? Transparency is not just a leader responsibility but other managers and employees contribute to organizational transparency.

Librarianship has strong core values that are the foundation of our services but librarians also create an environment that supports diversity of opinions. How does a library leader balance social justice while serving the broad needs of a community? Is there an inherent conflict between personal perspectives and the encompassing multiple viewpoints? Library leaders may face difficult decisions in determining social justice issues within their libraries considering personal beliefs, institutional responsibilities, and community impacts. Every library leader has opportunities to address social justice issues within libraries and in so doing, will advance community goals of inclusiveness of all members.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0193-0826	1540-3564		WOS:000385619200004

Using the microwave-photonic technique, many fiber interferometers with the same or different optical path differences were interrogated and their locations could be unambiguously determined. The distributed sensing capability was demonstrated using cascaded low-finesse Fabry-Perot interferometers fabricated by fs laser micromachining. Spatially continuous, fully distributed temperature and strain measurements were used as examples to demonstrate the capability of the proposed concept.

S	Wang, Yongqiang; Maxwell, Teddy; Bear, Edward; Anglea, Timothy			IEEE					A Unified Communication and Control Approach for Decentralized Heading Alignment in Robot Networks								PROCEEDINGS OF THE 28TH CHINESE CONTROL AND DECISION CONFERENCE (2016 CCDC)		Chinese Control and Decision Conference						2548	2553					2016	2016	As a critical component of collective motion coordination, decentralized heading alignment is fundamental in systems as diverse as vehicle platoons, mobile sensor networks, swarm robotics, and animal groups. Due to the intertwined interaction between nonlinear continuous-time robot/vehicle dynamics and (possibly) aperiodic discrete-time communication characteristics, a unified design of communication and control for heading alignment is extremely challenging. Existing approaches addressing decentralized heading alignment usually first perform analysis and design in the continuous-time domain and then conduct discretization-based implementation to deal with discontinuous information exchange that only happen at discrete-time instants. This two-stage strategy cannot guarantee the original designed control performance in final implementation since discretization can harm or even destabilize the heading controller designed in the continuous-time domain. Inspired by pulse based interaction in flashing fireflies and firing neurons, we propose a unified communication and control approach for collective heading alignment which addresses communication and control simultaneously and hence can retain design performance in final implementation. This approach only exchanges extremely simple and identical messages, which not only reduces processing complexity, transmission time and communication latency, but also implicitly ensures high scalability and robustness to interference in wireless communication. Experimental results on an actual swarm robotics platform are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed approach.					28th Chinese Control and Decision Conference28th Chinese Control and Decision Conference	MAY 28-30, 2016MAY 28-30, 2016	NE Univ, State Key Lab Synthet Automat Proc Ind; IEEE Ind Elect Chapter; Beifang Univ Nationalities; IEEE Control Syst Soc; Syst Engn Soc China; Chinese Assoc Artificial Intelligence; Chinese Assoc Artificial Intelligence, Tech Comm Control TheoryNE Univ, State Key Lab Synthet Automat Proc Ind; IEEE Ind Elect Chapter; Beifang Univ Nationalities; IEEE Control Syst Soc; Syst Engn Soc China; Chinese Assoc Artificial Intelligence; Chinese Assoc Artificial Intelligence, Tech Comm Control Theory	Yinchuan, PEOPLES R CHINAYinchuan, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0			1948-9439		978-1-4673-9714-8	WOS:000383222302148

Most conventional methods for specifying mechanical shock environments provide no mathematically defensible correlation between their parameters and the damage-causing potential of the environment, thus warranting the study of new methods to specify shock environments. In this paper, a variety of parameters that correlate to the damage-causing potential of a shock environment are identified. The parameters investigated are restricted to those that can be constrained during a real-time laboratory test. An analytical study using a sensitivity analysis determined the effect of each parameter on the damage-causing potential of a shock environment. These parameters are used to create shock specifications and investigate the simulated response of a structure. The parameters generated in this study improve mechanical shock testing by providing a strong correlation between the shock environment and the damage-causing potential of a mechanical shock.					34th IMAC Conference and Exposition on Structural Dynamics34th IMAC Conference and Exposition on Structural Dynamics	JAN 25-28, 2016JAN 25-28, 2016	Soc Experimental MechSoc Experimental Mech	Orlando, FLOrlando, FL	0	0	0	0	0	0			2191-5644		978-3-319-30087-0; 978-3-319-30086-3	WOS:000385281400005

COTTON WATER PRODUCTIVITY AND GROWTH PARAMETERS IN THE HUMID SOUTHEAST: EXPERIMENTATION AND MODELING								TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE				59	3			949	962		10.13031/trans.59.11601			2016	2016	A global challenge for the coming decades will be increasing food and fiber production with less water. This can be partially achieved by increasing water productivity (WP) or crop water use efficiency (WUE), i.e., yield or biomass produced per unit water used. Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is a major rainfed and irrigated crop in the U.S. and worldwide. While there is abundant information on cotton water use and yield relationships in drier regions, relevant field data and modeling in humid regions is not well developed. Robust crop models help complement field experimentation and predict the impact of irrigation management on production. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations has developed a crop model (AquaCrop) that has been parameterized for a number of crops including cotton, but not in a humid region. The objective of this study was twofold: (1) to quantify cotton water use and in-season biomass and growth parameters, and (2) to parameterize and validate AquaCrop to simulate cotton water use and productivity in the humid Southeast U.S., where water conservation and sustainability are emerging issues. Irrigation experiments were conducted from 2009 to 2011 under field conditions as well as under a newly installed automated rainout shelter at a Clemson University research site near Blackville, South Carolina. Extensive season-long soil, crop, and climate data were collected under irrigation regimes ranging from rainfed (i.e., no irrigation) to fully irrigated (i.e., meeting 100% of crop water needs). Season-long data collected in 2009 and 2011 under different irrigation regimes were used to parameterize the model. Cotton seasonal water use ranged from 320 mm at 33% irrigation to 718 mm at full irrigation, corresponding to average seed cotton yields of 2134 to 3682 kg ha(-1). Water use efficiency in the three years ranged from 0.48 to 0.71 kg of seed cotton per m(3) of water applied (irrigation and rainfall). Normalized water productivity for the local climate was nearly the same during the three years, averaging 12.5 g m(-2). Model parameterization was less demanding than expected, requiring adjustments of a few model parameters. Using the parameterized model with independent field data from 2010, the model simulated canopy cover, soil water content, aboveground dry biomass, and yield values that were highly correlated with measured values, with coefficients of determination (R-2) greater than 0.66. Seasonal crop water use was predicted within 5% for most treatments but underpredicted by as much as 18% for the 100% treatment at the shelter and for all irrigation treatments in 2010. The underprediction of crop water use corresponded to values of deep percolation simulated by AquaCrop. Field measurements were inadequate to verify deep percolation, but such measurements are suggested for future model investigations. Results of this study suggest that a properly parameterized AquaCrop model provides a useful tool to study yield response to water stress and evaluate the effects of drought and alternate management practices on productivity.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2151-0032	2151-0040		WOS:000385866800021		
J	Jing, Yiming; Ahn, Gail-Joon; Hu, Hongxin; Cho, Haehyun; Zhao, Ziming								TRIPLEMON: A multi-layer security framework for mediating inter-process communication on Android								JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SECURITY				24	4			405	426		10.3233/JCS-160552			2016	2016	As smartphones have become an indispensable part of daily life, mobile users are increasingly relying on them to process personal information with feature-rich applications. This situation requires robust security mechanisms for protecting sensitive applications and data on mobile devices. Android, as one the most popular smartphone operating systems, provides two core security mechanisms, application sandboxing and a permission system. However, recent studies show that these mechanisms are vulnerable to be passed by a variety of attacks. In this paper, we argue for the need of designing and implementing more comprehensive security mechanisms for Android. We realize that mediating Inter-Process Communication (IPC) channels used by Android applications can mitigate prominent attacks effectively and efficiently. Based on this observation, we propose a practical multi-layer security framework called TRIPLEMON to support policy-based mediation on Android IPC. We also discuss and evaluate a proof-of-concept prototype of TRIPLEMON along with the experimental results derived from real malware samples and synthetic attacks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0926-227X	1875-8924		WOS:000383803600001

Because literary works can reflect the lives, motivations and ideals of real cultures, the same adaptive forces governing the actions of actual persons may drive the interactions depicted in these stories. Based on this reasoning, we analysed the interactions in the Old-English poem Beowulf, asking whether the beneficent behaviour exhibited by the characters functions as costly signalling or as exchange-based interactions. We found that both mechanisms play a role but costly signalling provides benefits beyond those from relationships based on exchange. Specifically, gift exchange promoted comrade allegiance but costly signalling additionally provided status increase to the signaller. Furthermore, boasting about oneself forged alliances whereas telling tales about the exploits of others increased speaker status. We show that hypotheses derived from evolutionary theory can be explored through quantitative text analyses of period-specific literature.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0005-7959	1568-539X		WOS:000385053400013

Changes in methylation of genomic DNA from chicken immune organs in response to H5N1 influenza virus infection								GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH				15	3					UNSP 15037382	10.4238/gmr.15037382			2016	2016	DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification in eukaryotes, which plays a significant role in regulating gene expression. When the host is invaded by the influenza virus, gene expression is regulated via changes in DNA methylation levels or patterns, leading to the activation or suppression of relevant signaling pathways or networks, triggering a series of immune responses against viral invasion. Here, we investigated the changes in genomic DNA methylation in the immune organs of chicken infected with H5N1 influenza virus. Genome-wide DNA methylation levels in the spleen, thymus, and bursa of Fabricius of specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicken infected with the Guangdong (G-H5N1) and Anhui (A-H5N1) H5N1 strains, and water (control) were analyzed by fluorescence-labeled methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism (F-MSAP). The results indicated that total DNA methylation levels did not differ between spleen genomic DNA in chicken treated with different viral strains and the control (P > 0.05). However, the total DNA methylation levels were significantly upregulated in the thymus (P < 0.01) and bursa (P < 0.05) of chicken in the A-H5N1 group compared to those in the G-H5N1 and control groups. These results provide a basis for the screening of avian influenza-resistance genes or methylation markers, analyzing the epigenetic regulation mechanisms of avian influenza, and performing selective breeding for disease resistance.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1676-5680			WOS:000384881100016

The present paper illustrates the thermoelectric study of CoSb3-yWTe(2) meso-composites between 300 K and 575 K, where y denotes the weight percentage of WTe2 (y = 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12). Micro-sized WTe2 grains were randomly embedded in the nano-sized unfilled CoSb3 host matrix. We found that the electrical conductivity of CoSb3-yWTe(2) composites was markedly increased in a systematic trend with increasing WTe2 content. The enhancement of the electrical conductivity has been attributed to the locally percolated highly conductive WTe2 pellets along with better electrical connections between grains as a result of increased packing density. Meanwhile, the pronounced bipolar peak of pristine CoSb3 was quickly suppressed upon the addition of WTe2. The n-type thermopower of CoSb3-yWTe(2) composites became nearly linear between 300 K and 575 K, and the magnitude of thermopower decreased with increasing WTe2 content. The power factor is markedly enhanced up to 59 times that of the pristine CoSb3 upon compositing. The dimensionless thermoelectric figure-of-merit zT value of 0.78 is attained at 575 K, which promises practical applications for the unfilled CoSb3 composites.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000384238900023

Synthesis, characterization, and electrochemical properties of new highly processable, hole-transporting fluorocyclic aryl amine polymers								POLYMER CHEMISTRY				7	37			5799	5804		10.1039/c6py00966b			2016	2016	Superior hole-transporting mobility and excellent photoconductive properties of aryl amine-containing polymers place them among the most studied materials for optoelectronic applications. Solution process-ability, however, is a significant limitation to highly arylated polymers particularly for multi-layer organic light emitting devices prepared via spin coating. In this work, the preparation of perfluorocyclopentene aryl ether amine polymers demonstrated improved solubility, but has showed increased thermal stability. Octafluorocyclopentene was used as a coupling agent to prepare a new class of aryl ether amine-containing monomers ultimately yielding high molecular weight, optically transparent step-growth polymers. Herein, this work will present strategic routes for monomer/polymer synthesis, characterization, and viability as a new class of processable coatings or bulk components for the broad area of organic electronics applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1759-9954	1759-9962		WOS:000384405800006

However, this growth has mainly been process-driven. The evolution of engineering design to take advantage of the possibilities afforded by AM and to manage the constraints associated with the technology has lagged behind. This paper presents the major opportunities, constraints, and economic considerations for Design for Additive Manufacturing. It explores issues related to design and redesign for direct and indirect AM production. It also highlights key industrial applications, outlines future challenges, and identifies promising directions for research and the exploitation of AM's full potential in industry.

J	Eksioglu, Sandra Duni; Karimi, Hadi; Eksioglu, Burak								Optimization models to integrate production and transportation planning for biomass co-firing in coal-fired power plants								IIE TRANSACTIONS				48	10	SI		901	920		10.1080/0740817X.2015.1126004			2016	2016	Co-firing biomass is a strategy that leads to reduced greenhouse gas emissions in coal-fired power plants. Incentives such as the Production Tax Credit (PTC) are designed to help power plants overcome the financial challenges faced during the implementation phase. Decision makers at power plants face two big challenges. The first challenge is identifying whether the benefits from incentives such as PTC can overcome the costs associated with co-firing. The second challenge is identifying the extent to which a plant should co-fire in order to maximize profits. We present a novel mathematical model that integrates production and transportation decisions at power plants. Such a model enables decision makers to evaluate the impacts of co-firing on the system performance and the cost of generating renewable electricity. The model presented is a nonlinear mixed integer program that captures the loss in process efficiencies due to using biomass, a product that has lower heating value as compared with coal; the additional investment costs necessary to support biomass co-firing as well as savings due to PTC. In order to solve efficiently real-life instances of this problem we present a Lagrangean relaxation model that provides upper bounds and two linear approximations that provide lower bounds for the problem in hand. We use numerical analysis to evaluate the quality of these bounds. We develop a case study using data from nine states located in the southeast region of the United States. Via numerical experiments we observe that (i) incentives such as PTC do facilitate renewable energy production; (ii) the PTC should not be "one size fits all"; instead, tax credits could be a function of plant capacity or the amount of renewable electricity produced; (iii) there is a need for comprehensive tax credit schemes to encourage renewable electricity production and reduce GHG emissions.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0740-817X	1545-8830		WOS:000384021200002

Pertinent findings from our mailed survey of landowners in Brown County, Indiana, include that (1) individuals already engaged in land conservation or environmental activities are most likely to consider a conservation easement (CE), (2) hunters and anglers are less likely to have interest in CEs, and (3) few differences exist between seasonal and permanent residents. Among other things, this research highlights the significance for landowner willingness to grant a CE of involving landowners in conservation activities and environmental organizations.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0033-0124	1467-9272		WOS:000383877500008

The influence of the degree of surface roughness prepared by sandblasting on the bond between UHPC and the precast concrete was also studied. The test results showed that the third-point flexural bond test was a convenient and a more realistic test of the bond. The increase in the duration of sandblasting increased the roughness of the precast concrete surface, which was quantified by the sand-spread test. A duration of sandblasting of as short as 10 s was enough to achieve an adequate bond between UHPC and precast concrete at 7 days of age after casting of the UHPC, which was indicated by a failure in the precast concrete part. The ultimate flexural load of those specimens was about the same as the ultimate flexural load of a monolithic precast concrete specimen. Specimens that did not receive any surface roughening (i.e., specimens that were not sandblasted) failed at the bond between UHPC and precast concrete, regardless of the type of precast concrete surface: a sawed surface or a molded surface. The ultimate load carried by these specimens was lower than that carried by monolithic precast concrete specimens. Moreover, the strength of the bond between UHPC and precast concrete cast on an unroughened sawed surface was higher than that between UHPC and precast concrete cast on an unroughened molded surface.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0361-1981	2169-4052		WOS:000384158200012

A total of 48 rearrangements was discovered, relative to the standard banding sequence for the subgenus Simulium Latreille, 1802. One rearrangement, an inversion (IIS-C) in the short arm of the second chromosome, was fixed. Six (12.5%) of the rearrangements were autosomal polymorphisms, and the remaining 41 (85.4%) were sex linked. More than 40 X- and Y-linked rearrangements, predominantly inversions, were clustered in the long arm of the second chromosome (IIL), representing about 15% of the total complement. The pattern conforms to a nonrandom model of chromosome breakage, perhaps associated with an underlying molecular mechanism.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1993-0771	1993-078X		WOS:000383895600008	27551350

While many tourism destinations have strong cultural or heritage assets, not all destinations have primary attractions that can bring visitors to the region. Rather than developing special interest themes, rural areas that do not have enough of any one type of tourism resource to act as a primary draw may consider bundling different attraction types to increase visitation. The purpose of this study is to investigate the preferences of visitors to secondary heritage sites and explore the relationship between heritage tourism and alternative, non-heritage activities in rural areas. Findings revealed that motivation to visit small-scale heritage sites consisted of two dimensions: learning and recreation. The two motivational dimensions influenced visitors' interest in different heritage attractions and likelihood of visiting heritage tourism scenarios. As for alternative activities, there was a cluster of popular activities that were enjoyed by both learning-oriented and recreation-oriented respondents, but recreation-oriented visitors were more interested in nature-based activities and sport-related activities than learning-oriented visitors. Findings can help rural communities improve secondary attractions and diversify their tourism product by bundling heritage attractions with non-heritage activities.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0966-9582	1747-7646		WOS:000383903200002

The need for reliable, high-speed, secure underwater communication has turned increasingly to blue-light optical solutions. The blue-green visible wavelength window provides an attractive solution to the problem of underwater data transmission thanks to its low attenuation, where traditional RF solutions used in free-space communications collapse. Beginning with GaN laser diodes as the optical source, this work explores the encoding and transmission of digital data across underwater environments of varying turbidities. Given the challenges present in an underwater environment, such as the mechanical and optical turbulences that make proper alignment difficult to maintain, it is desirable to achieve extremely high data rates in order to allow the time window of alignment between the transmitter and receiver to be as small as possible. In this paper, work is done to increase underwater data rates through the use of orbital angular momentum. Results are shown for a range of data rates across a variety of channel types ranging in turbidity from that of a clear ocean to a dirty harbor.

An OAM mode of l=+2 is interfered with OAM mode l=-1 from a lambda = 540 nm laser source. These OAM modes are superimposed using a Mach-Zehnder (MZ) interferometer combined with diffractive optical elements. By manipulating the optical path length of one of the MZ legs, the interference of these beams can be temporally controlled. The spatial profile is maintained in a turbid environment up through 4.9 attenuation lengths for both cases.

These datacenters provide different Get/Put latencies and unit prices for resource utilization and reservation. Thus, when selecting different CSPs' datacenters, cloud customers of globally distributed applications (e.g., online social networks) face two challenges: i) how to allocate data to worldwide datacenters to satisfy application SLO (service level objective) requirements including both data retrieval latency and availability, and ii) how to allocate data and reserve resources in datacenters belonging to different CSPs to minimize the payment cost. To handle these challenges, we first model the cost minimization problem under SLO constraints using integer programming. Due to its NP-hardness, we then introduce our heuristic solution, including a dominant-cost based data allocation algorithm and an optimal resource reservation algorithm. We finally introduce an infrastructure to enable the conduction of the algorithms. Our trace-driven experiments on a supercomputing cluster and on real clouds (i.e., Amazon S3, Windows Azure Storage and Google Cloud Storage) show the effectiveness of our algorithms for SLO guaranteed services and customer cost minimization.

CyberPLAYce finds inspiration in the concept of child-computer interaction, where meaning is constructed through spatially reconfiguring the physical environment. The novel aspect of CyberPLAYce is its extension of cyber-learning to the dimension of space where children construct meaning at a larger physical scale. This paper outlines the motivations for CyberPLAYce, focuses on the full arc of design and evaluation activities concerning computational thinking (CT) practices that engaged 8-12-year-old storytellers, and concludes with a consideration of future work focusing on spatial thinking with CyberPLAYce. Results from our empirical study suggest that cyber-physical play afforded by CyberPLAYce scaffolds computational thinking, creating, and sharing in children. Particularly for IDC researchers in the educational domain, CyberPLAYce represents a Research-through-design exemplar supporting children's enjoyment of learning and meaning-construction.					15th International ACM Conference on Interaction Design and Children (IDC)15th International ACM Conference on Interaction Design and Children (IDC)	JUN 21-24, 2016JUN 21-24, 2016	British Broadcasting Corp, Res & Dev Grp; ACMBritish Broadcasting Corp, Res & Dev Grp; ACM	Univ Cent Lancashire, Child Comp Interact, Media City, ENGLANDUniv Cent Lancashire, Child Comp Interact, Media City, ENGLAND	0	0	0	0	0	0					*****************	WOS:000383741700015

We tested whether dual therapy with targeted nanoparticles (NPs) can remove mineral deposits (by delivery of a chelating agent, ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA)) and restore elastic lamina (by delivery of a polyphenol, pentagalloyl glucose (PGG)) to reverse moderate aneurysm development. EDTA followed by PGG NP delivery led to reduction in macrophage recruitment, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity, elastin degradation and calcification in the aorta as compared to delivery of control blank NPs. Such dual therapy restored vascular elastic lamina and improved vascular function as observed by improvement in circumferential strain. Therefore, dual targeted therapy may be an attractive option to remove mineral deposits and restore healthy arterial structures in moderately developed aneurysms.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1838-7640			WOS:000384108900017	27698934

Biomechanical evaluation of polymethyl methacrylate with the addition of various doses of cefazolin, vancomycin, gentamicin, and silver microparticles								VETERINARY AND COMPARATIVE ORTHOPAEDICS AND TRAUMATOLOGY				29	5			394	401		10.3415/VCOT-16-01-0005			2016	2016	Objectives: Numerous studies have examined the biomechanics of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) with added antibiotics, but direct comparison between studies is difficult. Our purpose was to evaluate the effects of the addition of antibiotic drugs and silver on compressive and bending strength of PMMA. Our null hypothesis was that there would be no significant difference in the compressive strength or bending strength of PMMA with the addition of silver or varying amounts of antibiotic drugs.Methods: Polymethyl methacrylate was mixed with cefazolin, gentamicin, vancomycin, or silver; the control was PMMA alone. Antibiotic groups contained 20 g PMMA and 0.5 g, 1 g, 2 g, or 3 g of antibiotic. Silver groups had 0.25 g silver powder alone added to 20 g PMMA or silver with PMMA and 0, 0.5 g or 1 g of antibiotic. Samples underwent four-point bending and compression testing in air at room temperature and prevailing humidity. Pairwise comparisons between groups and to the ASTM and ISO standards were performed.Results: Compression: All antibiotic and silver groups were weaker than the control. Samples with cefazolin tended to be stronger than other antibiotic groups with equivalent doses of antibiotic. All groups were above the ASTM standard, except 3 g vancomycin. Four-point bending: The addition of antibiotics did not significantly affect bending strength in groups with lower doses of antibiotics. The silver + PMMA group was weaker than the control. No groups were significantly below the ISO standard except the 3 g vancomycin group.Clinical significance: The addition of antibiotic or silver decreased the biomechanical strength in all samples, but not below the ASTM or ISO standard for most groups. The addition of cefazolin appears to affect strength the least, while high doses of vancomycin alter strength the most.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0932-0814			WOS:000383729300007	27468765

A three-step knowledge discovery and data mining process is used to develop a set of rules. This set provides decision support to engineers while they perform FMEA on flexible vehicle components. The first step is where traditional FMEAs are performed on flexible components. In the second step, a decision tree algorithm (J48) is used to extract rules from the collected data. The third step involves manual post-processing of the rules extracted by the decision tree algorithm. Finally, the set of rules is implemented in a knowledge-based FMEA tool that can be used to provide decision support to engineers while they perform FMEAs on flexible components. The tool is used to identify and review quality issues within a complete vehicle. The top ten issues identified from the FMEA are submitted to design and manufacturing engineers for detailed evaluations. (C) 2016 The Authors.

We present a satisfiability approach to the problem, in which a suite of conflict classes are developed, representing potential configurator failure modes. Satisfiability logic routines test the potential presence of each conflict class if the proposed change is adopted, using an integrated constraint set including both part allocation and customization object relationships.

J	Anderson, Jason; Agarwal, Udit; Li, Hongda; Hu, Hongxin; Lowery, Craig; Apon, Amy			IEEE					Performance Considerations of Network Functions Virtualization using Containers								2016 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING, NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS (ICNC)														2016	2016	The network performance of virtual machines plays a critical role in Network Functions Virtualization (NFV), and several technologies have been developed to address hardware-level virtualization shortcomings. Recent advances in operating system level virtualization and deployment platforms such as Docker have made containers an ideal candidate for high performance application encapsulation and deployment. However, Docker and other solutions typically use lower-performing networking mechanisms. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using technologies designed to accelerate virtual machine networking with containers, in addition to quantifying the network performance of container-based VNFs compared to the state-of-the-art virtual machine solutions. Our results show that containerized applications can provide lower latency and delay variation, and can take advantage of high performance networking technologies previously only used for hardware virtualization.

S	Maja, Joe Mari J.; Campbell, Todd; Camargo Neto, Joao; Astillo, Philip						Valasek, J; Thomasson, JA		Predicting cotton yield of small field plots in a cotton breeding program using UAV Imagery data								AUTONOMOUS AIR AND GROUND SENSING SYSTEMS FOR AGRICULTURAL OPTIMIZATION AND PHENOTYPING		Proceedings of SPIE		9866						UNSP 98660C	10.1117/12.2228929			2016	2016	One of the major criteria used for advancing experimental lines in a breeding program is yield performance. Obtaining yield performance data requires machine picking each plot with a cotton picker, modified to weigh individual plots. Harvesting thousands of small field plots requires a great deal of time and resources. The efficiency of cotton breeding could be increased significantly while the cost could be decreased with the availability of accurate methods to predict yield performance.This work is investigating the feasibility of using an image processing technique using a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) camera mounted on a small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (sUAV) to collect normal RGB images in predicting cotton yield on small plot. An orthonormal image was generated from multiple images and used to process multiple, segmented plots. A Gaussian blur was used to eliminate the high frequency component of the images, which corresponds to the cotton pixels, and used image subtraction technique to generate high frequency pixel images. The cotton pixels were then separated using k-means cluster with 5 classes. Based on the current work, the calculated percentage cotton area was computed using the generated high frequency image (cotton pixels) divided by the total area of the plot. Preliminary results showed (five flights, 3 altitudes) that cotton cover on multiple pre-selected 227 sq. m. plots produce an average of 8% which translate to approximately 22.3 kgs. of cotton. The yield prediction equation generated from the test site was then use on a separate validation site and produced a prediction error of less than 10%. In summary, the results indicate that a COTS camera with an appropriate image processing technique can produce results that are comparable to expensive sensors.

J	Bai, Wei; Raghavendra, Achyut; Podila, Ramakrishna; Brown, Jared M.								Defect density in multiwalled carbon nanotubes influences ovalbumin adsorption and promotes macrophage activation and CD4(+) T-cell proliferation								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE				11				4357	4371		10.2147/IJN.S111029			2016	2016	Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are of great interest for the development of drugs and vaccines due to their unique physicochemical properties. The high surface area to volume ratio and delocalized pi-electron cloud of CNTs promote binding of proteins to the surface forming a protein corona. This unique feature of CNTs has been recognized for potential delivery of antigens for strong and long-lasting antigen-specific immune responses. Based on an earlier study that demonstrated increased protein binding, we propose that carboxylated multiwalled CNTs (MWCNTs) can function as an improved carrier to deliver antigens such as ovalbumin (OVA). To test this hypothesis, we coated carboxylated MWCNTs with OVA and measured uptake and activation of antigen-presenting cells (macrophages) and their ability to stimulate CD4(+) T-cell proliferation. We employed two types of carboxylated MWCNTs with different surface areas and defects (MWCNT-2 and MWCNT-30). MWCNT-2 and MWCNT-30 have surface areas of similar to 215 m(2)/g and 94 m(2)/g, respectively. The ratios of D-to G-band areas (I-D/I-G) were 0.97 and 1.37 for MWCNT-2 and MWCNT-30, respectively, samples showing that MWCNT-30 contained more defects. The increase in defects in MWCNT-30 led to increased binding of OVA as compared to MWCNT-2 (1,066 +/- 182 mu g/mL vs 582 +/- 41 mu g/mL, respectively). Both types of MWCNTs, along with MWCNT-OVA complexes, showed no observable toxicity to bone-marrow-derived macrophages up to 5 days. Surprisingly, we found that MWCNT-OVA complex significantly increased the expression of major histocompatibility complex class II on macrophages and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin 6), while MWCNTs without OVA protein corona did not. The coculture of MWCNT-OVA-complex-treated macrophages and OVA-specific CD4(+) T-cells isolated from OT-II mice demonstrated robust proliferation of CD4(+) T-cells. This study provides strong evidence for a role for defects in carboxylated MWCNTs and their use in the efficient delivery of antigens for the development of next-generation vaccines.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1178-2013			WOS:000383185400001	27621627

The Impact of Traffic Incident Locations on a Metropolitan Evacuation								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION				4	2			81	96		10.14257/ijt.2016.4.2.06			2016	2016	Modeling emergency evacuations can help engineers, planners, and emergency managers identify the approximate time it would take for evacueesto leave a disaster area. Unfortunately, many evacuation studies do not account for traffic incidents. This study examined the effect of traffic incidents during a no notice emergency evacuation in the eastern St. Louis metropolitan area road network. The roadway network was modeled using traffic micro-simulation software VISSIM, which utilized the expected traffic volumes that were determined by the regional planning agency, and guided by input from the transportation engineers at the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT). Because traffic speeds are expected to be low during such a high-volume event, this study considered only minor incidents. Incident locations were selected based on historical data. The results suggest that minor traffic incidents occurring upstream of key bottlenecks created no significant change in delay or evacuation duration. On the contrary, minor traffic incidents downstream of bottlenecks can significantly increase delay; albeit not enough to delay the duration of the entire evacuation by more than 15 minutes. Thus, during no notice emergency evacuations, traffic managers could prioritize available traffic incident management resources accordingly.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2287-7940			WOS:000382776400007

Content channels have different popularity ranking, and therefore, unpopular channels have low probability of being watched. Service providers can exploit this to use limited bandwidth to provide the same number of content channels to users. Our solution investigates the effect of using limited bandwidth allocation on the percieved quality from users' perspective. We ran experiments in which the video quality is adjusted according to bandwidth load. Our results show that it is possible to achieve a reasonable quality of service even when allocating lower bandwidth than would be needed in a traditional broadcast deployment.					13th IEEE Annual Consumer Communications and Networking Conference (CCNC)13th IEEE Annual Consumer Communications and Networking Conference (CCNC)	JAN 06-13, 2016JAN 06-13, 2016	IEEEIEEE	Las Vegas, NVLas Vegas, NV	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4673-9292-1	WOS:000382042200122

This paper presents the design of a robust fixed-order loop shaping controller to damp out the inter-area oscillations and to enhance the stability of the power system. The proposed loop shaping method is based on the shaping of the open-loop transfer function in the Nyquist diagram through minimizing the quadratic error between the actual and the desired open loop transfer functions in the frequency domain. The proposed method is robust with respect to multi-model uncertainty. Despite other robust controller design methods, the proposed approach deals with the entire system i.e. there is no need to reduce the system and still leads to a lower order controller. The proposed method is applied on the two area four machine system under different load conditions and different wind generations. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method in damping inter-area oscillations are validated using case studies.

IEEE					Experimental PWM Method Validation of a 9-level 4.16 kV Series Connected H-bridge Grid Simulator								2016 IEEE POWER AND ENERGY CONFERENCE AT ILLINOIS (PECI)		IEEE Power and Energy Conference at Illinois												2016	2016	Controllable ac sources, sometimes referred to as grid simulators, are becoming more common for grid integration testing of inverters as new grid interactive inverter functions develop. Due to the relatively niche application, high power grid simulators are often made by repurposing commercial drives with additional systems integration by the manufacturer or end user including filters, transformers, and control features. Simulation models, invaluable for pre-test simulations and future retrofits to the drive, are not usually provided with the drive and must therefore be developed by end users. Pulse-width modulation details are often overlooked in this process, using defaults within the simulation environment. Validating the digital implementation of PWM, including sampling method, is beneficial as it can have significant effects on control bandwidth especially on multi-level and interleaved converters. The grid simulator considered here utilizes 9-level series-connected H bridge topology. Experimental setup and results are shown for two carrier frequencies, 600 Hz and 2 kHz, verifying an effective phase shifted carrier each with double-edge sampling.

Thomas, BH; Lindeman, R; Marchal, M		A Schematic Eye for Virtual Environments								2016 IEEE SYMPOSIUM ON 3D USER INTERFACES (3DUI)								221	230					2016	2016	This paper presents a schematic eye model designed for use by virtual environments researchers and practitioners. This model, based on a combination of several ophthalmic models, attempts to very closely approximate a user's optical centers and intraocular separation using as little as a single measurement of pupillary distance (PD). Typically, these parameters are loosely approximated based on the PD of the user while converged to some known distance. However, this may not be sufficient for users to accurately perform spatially sensitive tasks in the near field. We investigate this possibility by comparing the impact of several common PD-based models and our schematic eye model on users' ability to accurately match real and virtual targets in depth. This was done using a specially designed display and robotic positioning apparatus that allowed sub-millimeter measurement of target positions and user responses. We found that the schematic eye model resulted in significantly improved real to virtual matches with average accuracy, in some cases, well under 1mm. We also present a novel, low-cost method of accurately measuring PD using an off-the-shelf trial frame and pinhole filters. We validated this method by comparing its measurements against those taken using an ophthalmic autorefractor. Significant differences were not found between the two methods.

We aim to understand how the perceptual characteristics between real and virtual worlds affect physical reaches during 3D interaction. Typically, participants spatially reach to the perceived location of objects in 3D to perform selection and manipulation activities. These physical reach motions include those of virtual assembly tasks or rehabilitation exercises in which the participants only have approximate perceptual information in the virtual world compared to the real world situation due to technological limitations such as minimal visual field of view and resolution as well as latency and jitter associated with physical movements. In this poster, we try to understand how the motor responses of participants differ between visually guided versus non-visually guided situations. We compared and contrasted the motor component of 3D interaction between the virtual and physical world by investigating factors such as accuracy and velocity of each reaching task.

After a two-round Delphi method, we distributed the questionnaire to 404 secondary and tertiary hospitals in Guangdong Province, China, and 379 completed questionnaires were collected. The final questionnaire was then developed on the basis of the results of exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis.Results: Analysis suggested that all internal consistency reliabilities exceeded the minimum reliability standard of 0.70 for the a coefficient. The overall scale coefficient was 0.87, and 6 subscale coefficients were 0.92 (strategic management), 0.81 (budget and expenditure), 0.85 (financing), 0.75 (financing, medical management), 0.86 (human resources) and 0.86 (accountability). Correlation coefficients between and among items and their hypothesised subscales were higher than those with other subscales. The value of average variance extracted (AVE) was higher than 0.5, the value of construct reliability (CR) was higher than 0.7, and the square roots of the AVE of each subscale were larger than the correlation of the specific subscale with the other subscales, supporting the convergent and discriminant validity of the Chinese version of the Hospital Autonomy Questionnaire (CVHAQ). The model fit indices were all acceptable: chi(2)/df=1.73, Goodness of Fit Index (GFI) = 0.93, Adjusted Goodness of Fit Index (AGFI) = 0.91, Non-Normed Fit Index (NNFI) = 0.96, Comparative Fit Index (CFI) = 0.97, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) = 0.04, Standardised Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) = 0.07.Conclusions: This study demonstrated the reliability and validity of a CVHAQ and provides a quantitative method for the assessment of hospital autonomy.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2044-6055			WOS:000381514500135	26911587

SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIABILITY OF STANDARDIZED PRECIPITATION INDEX OVER INDOCHINA PENINSULA								CUADERNOS DE INVESTIGACION GEOGRAFICA				42	1			221	232		10.18172/cig.2928			2016	2016	Indochina Peninsula has abundant water resources; however, most of the rain falls during the wet season. An arid condition is quite pronounced throughout the dry season. The majority of population depends on the agriculture as the main source of livelihood income. It is, therefore, important to study the drought and wetness over the region because crops are vulnerable to extreme climatic conditions. We used gridded precipitation APHRODITE and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) to evaluate the spatial and temporal variability of drought and wetness over Indochina peninsula. Nonparametric Modified Mann-Kendall (MMK) trend test was applied to determine the SPI trends over this region. There is a decrease in precipitation over a large part of Indochina during winter (dry season) and an increasing pattern during summer (rainy season). The increasing trend of SPI indicates an increase in wet condition over most parts of Indochina Peninsula except for Red River Delta in Vietnam, central parts of Vietnam/Laos and western parts of Cambodia.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0211-6820	1697-9540		WOS:000382769100013

In recent years, various optofluid based structures have been investigated in/on an optical fiber platform which is referred to as "lab in/on a fiber". Among those integrated structures, femto-second laser micromaching technique plays an important role due to its high precision fabrication, flexible design, 3D capability, and compatible with other methods. Here we present a ferrofluid based optical fiber magnetic field sensor fabricated by femtosecond (fs) laser irradiation. With the help of fs laser micromaching technique, a micro-reservoir made by capillary tube assembled in a single mode optical fiber could be fabricated. The micro-reservoir functions as a fiber inline Fabry-Perot (FP) cavity which is filled by ferrofluid liquid. The refractive index of the ferrofluid varies as the surrounding magnetic field strength changes, which can be optically probed by the FP interferometer. A fringe visibility of up to 30 dB can be achieved with a detection limit of around 0.4 Gausses. Due to the fabrication, micro-reservoirs can be assembled with optical fiber and distinguished through a microwave-photonic interrogation system. A quasi-distributed magnetic field sensing application has been demonstrated with a high spatial resolution of around 10 cm.

J	Crouch, Elizabeth; Dickes, Lori								Economic repercussions of marital infidelity								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY AND SOCIAL POLICY				36	1-2			53	65		10.1108/IJSSP-03-2015-0032			2016	2016	Purpose - Numerous scholars have studied the propensity and related determinants of marital infidelity across socioeconomic and demographic groups. However, the broader social and economic consequences of infidelity remain an unexplored question, particularly the macroeconomic consequences from the individual impacts on families and households. The paper aims to discuss these issues.Design/methodology/approach - Using income data from the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, the purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to analyze the relationship between the probability of infidelity and income and second, to quantify the cost of marital infidelity on individual families and taxpayers. The results confirm that infidelity makes individual households poorer, but goes further to reveal widespread negative externalities that fall to taxpayers from the consequences of family fragmentation.Findings - The results of this study indicate a review of government policy since numerous government policies contradict the incentive to stay married. Future research should consider additional estimations of the full range of costs related to infidelity and family fragmentation with particular focus on the public programs that may absorb the brunt of the negative externalities resulting from divorce.Research limitations/implications - This research confirms earlier research that infidelity has a high probability of causing divorce. Combined with this research, the analysis confirms a statistically significant negative relationship between infidelity and income and that when infidelity causes divorce, the results are substantial public economic and social costs. By definition public economic and social costs are borne by society, resulting in increased taxpayer burdens for society at large.Practical implications - Previously, the consequences of infidelity were a largely unexplored question. There had been some work on the probability of infidelity but little beyond this. Further, there had been minimal literature on the social efficiency of infidelity, especially research focussing on the external costs imposed on third parties such as children and taxpayers (Smith, 2012). This work took earlier research further by first confirming the negative impact on household income based on the probability of infidelity. Additionally, this is the only study that has examined the economic consequences of divorce due to infidelity. This research confirms that the presence of infidelity, especially when it leads to divorce, results in substantial economic and social externalities resulting from family fragmentation. Future research would benefit from a more in depth understanding of the characteristics that relate to the increased probability of infidelity, separate from and in conjunction with divorce. Furthermore, examining costs as they relate to specific programs, like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, may clarify the impact of family fragmentation on specific programs. Additionally, the results from this study can be incorporated into larger sets of findings focussing on government policy to better understand the full range of social implications from infidelity.Social implications - Future research should consider additional estimations of the full range of costs related to infidelity and family fragmentation, with particular focus on the public programs that may absorb the brunt of the negative externalities resulting from divorce. The most pertinent policies influencing the rate of marriage and divorce in the USA are the income tax code, Social Security spousal and survivor benefits, the Earned Income Tax Credit, child support enforcement, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, food stamps, Medical, Supplemental Security Income, and WIC (Burstein, 2007). A review of these policies and their incentive structure related to family cohesiveness should be considered as a part of larger cost/benefit analysis of these programs.Originality/value - This work took earlier research further by first confirming the negative impact on household income based on the probability of infidelity. Additionally, this is the only study that has examined the economic consequences of divorce due to infidelity. This research confirms that the presence of infidelity, especially when it leads to divorce, results in substantial economic and social externalities resulting from family fragmentation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0144-333X	1758-6720		WOS:000382552300004

The proposed 13 cascaded IFPIs have been formed by 14 cascaded reflectors that have been fabricated on a grade index MMF. Each reflector has been made by drawing a line on the center of the cross-section of the MMF through a femtosecond laser. The distance between any two adjacent reflectors is around 100 cm. The optical carrier based microwave interferometry (OCMI) technique has been used to interrogate the MMF based cascaded FPIs system by reading the optical interference information in the microwave domain. The location along with the shift of the interference fringe pattern for each FPI can be resolved though signal processing based on the microwave domain information. The multimode interference showed very little influence to the microwave domain signals. By using such system the strain of 10(-4) for each FPI sensor and the spatial resolution of less than 5 cm for the system can be easily achieved.

As well, herbivorous arthropods attempt to attack etiolated seedlings and chose the apical hook for ingestion, aimed at dropping the cotyledons for later consumption. Etiolated seedlings, as we show here, have established an efficient mechanism of protecting their Achilles' heel against these predators, however. Evidence is provided for a role of jasmonic acid (JA) in this largely uncharacterized plant-herbivore interaction during skotomorphogenesis and that this comprises the temporally and spatially tightly controlled synthesis of a cysteine protease inhibitors of the Kunitz family. Interestingly, the same Kunitz protease inhibitor was found to be expressed in flowers of Arabidopsis where endogenous JA levels are high for fertility. Because both the apical hook and inflorescences were preferred isopod targets in JA-deficient plants that could be rescued by exogenously administered JA, our data identify a JAdependent mechanism of plant arthropod deterrence that is recalled in different organs and at quite different times of plant development.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1559-2316	1559-2324		WOS:000382577800014

Examining Cross-Age Peer Conversations Relevant to Character: Can a Digital Story About Bullying Promote Students' Understanding of Humility?								RESEARCH IN HUMAN DEVELOPMENT				13	2	SI		111	125		10.1080/15427609.2016.1166014			2016	2016	Successful character education programs are commonly marked by components including conversations about moral issues; however, little is known about what students actually talk about in such programs. Using initial data from the Arthur Interactive Media Buddy Project, this study examined whether a digital comic about bullying generated meaningful conversations surrounding humility. The sample was 52 cross-age peers in elementary school. Analyses involved an iterative, deductive-inductive coding process resulting in a total of ten codes, of which three were most readily identified in peers' conversations: perspective taking, affect labeling, and empathic responding. Limitations and implications relevant to character education are discussed.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1542-7609	1542-7617		WOS:000381277300003

Adolescents' Character Role Models: Exploring Who Young People Look Up to as Examples of How to Be a Good Person								RESEARCH IN HUMAN DEVELOPMENT				13	2	SI		126	141		10.1080/15427609.2016.1164552			2016	2016	Research has explored young people's role models in general, but little is known about role models whom youth look up to in relation to their character. The authors asked 220 adolescents (M age = 13.4, 45% White, 15% Hispanic, 11% Black) from Massachusetts and Connecticut to nominate a character role model, someone they knew personally and looked up to as an example of how to be a good person; 142 (64.5%) listed a character role model, with family members nominated most frequently, followed by friends and other adults (e.g., teachers). Youth cited how their character role model treated them as well as other people as reasons for selecting their character role models. Participants also rated the quality of the relationship, role-modeling behaviors, and socialization practices. There were similar positive characteristics associated with the three character role model types, but there were also differences (e.g., family character role models were rated most positively on relationship quality as well as role-modeling behaviors, whereas friend character role models rarely provided character socialization). Findings suggested that youth understand the relational nature of character and also point to the potentially powerful role of character role models in promoting character development.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1542-7609	1542-7617		WOS:000381277300004

High performance BMI composites are used for Aerospace application for their mechanical strength. They are also used as an alternative to toughened epoxy resins. A femtosecond-laser-inscribed Intrinsic Fabry-Perot Interferometer (IFPI) sensor is used to perform real time cure monitoring of a BMI composite. The composite is cured using the out-of-autoclave (OOA) process. The IFPI sensor was used for in-situ monitoring; different curing stages are analyzed throughout the curing process. Temperature-induced-strain was measured to analyze the cure properties. The IFPI structure comprises of two reflecting mirrors inscribed on the core of the fiber using a femtosecond-laser manufacturing process. The manufacturing process makes the sensor thermally stable and robust for embedded applications. The sensor can withstand very high temperatures of up to 850 degrees C. The temperature and strain sensitivities of embedded IFPI sensor were measured to be 1.4 pm/mu epsilon and 0.6 pm/mu epsilon, respectively.

However, often the degradation of structures leads to the failures earlier than designed service life. Thus, non-destructive testing techniques are urgently needed to evaluate the health information of the structures. In this paper, the implementation of Electrical Resistance Tomography (ERT) was investigated. This low cost, radiation free and easy to perform modality is based on measuring the electrical properties of the material under test and using that to evaluate the existence of defects in that material. It uses a set of boundary potentials and injected current to reconstruct the conductivity distribution. An automatic measurement system was developed and surface damages as well as subsurface damages on mortar specimens were investigated. The reconstructed images were capable to show the presence and the location of the damages.

B	Jenkins, Tom						Eastridge, ML		What We Need to Know to Improve the Utilization of Fat in Diets								TRI-STATE DAIRY NUTRITION CONFERENCE, 2016								35	48					2016	2016	High fat ingredients are commonplace in diets fed to dairy cattle and include commercial fat supplements designed for convenient transport and mixing, oilseeds such as cottonseed or soybeans, or byproducts such as distillers grains, tallow, or food processing wastes. Strategies for optimizing benefits from feeding additional fat remain focused today, as in the past, on minimizing problems with intake, rumen function, and digestibility. All of these limitations are a function of several important fat attributes, including its fatty acid content, the relative proportions of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, the concentration of free fatty acids, accessibility of the fat to microbial exposure, and the extent of chemical alteration such as calcium salts. When fed properly, animal performance benefits from feeding additional fat are well documented and extend beyond just the expected improvements in lactation performance based solely on the fat energy value. These additional benefits have included improvements in efficiency, reproductive performance, and even the immune system and disease resistance. However, many exciting future benefits of feeding additional fat to dairy cattle may be on the horizon. These might include managing the rumen production of biohydrogenation trans intermediates to take advantage of metabolic benefits, or managing the absorption of selected fatty acids to enhance their function as precursors for signaling molecules, and perhaps even feeding fatty acids prepartum for fetal imprinting and potential lifetime production benefits.					25th Tri-State Dairy Nutrition Conference25th Tri-State Dairy Nutrition Conference	APR 18-20, 2016APR 18-20, 2016	Michigan State Univ; Purdue Univ; Ohio State UnivMichigan State Univ; Purdue Univ; Ohio State Univ	Grand Wayne Ctr, Ft Wayne, INGrand Wayne Ctr, Ft Wayne, IN	0	0	0	0	0	0					*****************	WOS:000381162300003

Solutions of particle mixtures (similar to 4 mu m silica and similar to 10 mu m polystyrene) and cell mixtures (viable and non-viable yeast cells, normal and cancer human breast cells, healthy and malaria infected red blood cells) are infused into a microfluidic channel, separately, and measured at similar to 3 GHz in time domain. The results show that individual particles and cells can be effectively detected and differentiated. With better control of cell positions, the interferometer is promising to be an effective tool for single cell based biomedical studies.

The refractive index and thermoptic coefficients of samples were measured at lambda = 4.515 mu m using an IR-modified Metricon prism coupler, located at University of Central Florida. Thermo-optic coefficient (dn/dT) values were shown to range from approximately -40 ppm/degrees C to +65 ppm/degrees C, and refractive index was shown to vary between approximately 2.5000 and 2.8000. Trends in refractive index and dn/dT were found to be related to the atomic structures present within the glassy network, as opposed to the atomic percentage of any individual constituent. A linear correlation was found between the quantity (n(-3).dn/dT) and the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the glass, suggesting the ability to compositionally design chalcogenide glass compositions with zero dn/dT, regardless of refractive index or dispersion performance. The tunability of these novel glasses offer increased thermal and mechanical stability as compared to the current commercial zero dn/dT options such as AMTIR-5 from Amorphous Materials Inc. For IR imaging systems designed to achieve passive athermalization, utilizing chalcogenide glasses with their tunable ranges of dn/dT (including zero) can be key to addressing system size, weight, and power (SWaP) limitations.

J	Skibins, Jeffrey; Powell, Robert; Hallo, Jeffrey								Lucky 13: conservation implications of broadening "Big 5" flagship species recognition in East Africa								JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM				24	7			1024	1040		10.1080/09669582.2015.1101126			2016	2016	Sustainable tourism experiences seek to inspire tourists to perform behaviors that enhance the environment on site and at home. In sustainable wildlife tourism, flagship species are used as icons to attract attention for conservation initiatives. Parks and protected areas also rely on flagship species to attract visitation. Expected tourist responses from the use of flagship species include raising concern and stimulating proconservation behaviors. However, flagship-based ecotourism has been criticized for not delivering expected conservation benefits for species of interest or biodiversity, and having negative impacts for wildlife on site. Using interactional theory as a framework, this study investigated the potential of the African "Big 5", and eight other commonly observed African species, to stimulate an emotional connection and intention to perform species and biodiversity oriented conservation behaviors. Data were obtained from 416 tourists at Kilimanjaro Airport and analyzed with structural equation modeling. Tourists reported a connection to all 13 species, and this connection was strongly predictive of species and biodiversity oriented behavioral intentions. No differences were observed between the traditional "Big 5" and additional species. Results suggest that species beyond the "Big 5" may be effective flagship species for African parks and protected areas and the associated tourism industry.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0966-9582	1747-7646		WOS:000382391000006

The benefit of small incisions has a disadvantage of limited visualization of subsurface tissues. Image-guided surgery (IGS) uses pre-operative and intra-operative images to map subsurface structures. One particular laparoscopic system is the daVinci-si robotic surgical system. The video streams generate approximately 360 megabytes of data per second. Real-time processing this large stream of data on a bedside PC, single or dual node setup, has become challenging and a high-performance computing (HPC) environment may not always be available at the point of care. To process this data on remote HPC clusters at the typical 30 frames per second rate, it is required that each 11.9 MB video frame be processed by a server and returned within 1/30th of a second.We have implement and compared performance of compression, segmentation and registration algorithms on Clemson's Palmetto supercomputer using dual NVIDIA K40 GPUs per node. Our computing framework will also enable reliability using replication of computation. We will securely transfer the files to remote HPC clusters utilizing an OpenFlow-based network service, Steroid OpenFlow Service (SOS) that can increase performance of large data transfers over long-distance and high bandwidth networks. As a result, utilizing high-speed OpenFlow-based network to access computing clusters with GPUs will improve surgical procedures by providing real-time medical image processing and laparoscopic data.

A pronounced transparency peak was obtained in the transmission spectrum, which resulted from the destructive interference between the graphene dipole and monopole antennas. Further investigations have shown that the spectral location and lineshape of the transparency peak can be dynamically controlled by tuning the Fermi level in graphene. Since the monopole antennas in our designed structure exist in a continuous form, a more convenient method for tunablity is available by applying a gate voltage compared to those structures with discrete graphene patterns. This work may open up new avenues for designing tunable terahertz functional devices and slow light devices.									2	0	0	0	0	2			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000382068000022	27500393

The inherent segregation between fluorine-and hydrogen-rich segments produced structured interfaces with fluorinated and protonated nano domains. The morphologies of the interfaces and their corresponding surface energies were probed by AFM and the alignment of 8CB was investigated by polarized optical microscopy. We found that varying the fluorine content controlled both the structure and the interfacial morphology. The 8CB layer orientation was strongly affected by the interracial energies. With increasing fluorine content the homeotropic alignment temperature range of 8CB in the nematic phase was increased and that of the smectic phase was hardly affected. The impact observed was attributed to competition between anchoring effects and elasticity of the LC layers.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2046-2069			WOS:000381512600098

This condition is associated with Peripheral Arterial Occlusive Disease, or diabetic foot ulceration, which is classified as the most common cause for lower extremity amputation in the modern, industrialized world. Neuropathy, associated with lack of protective sensation allows patient to apply repetitive stress leading to the formation of ulcers without their knowledge. Regular inspection of the afflicted area by a physician is the best prevention method for this condition. This process requires increased scrutiny by physicians and more frequent visits by the patients. To simplify and reduce the costs of the process of examination, a low cost system for skin self-monitoring by patients was developed. A near infrared camera was built utilizing a Raspberry Pi 2.0 System in conjunction with optical filters, and image analysis tools to detect venous blood in tissues using differences in optical spectra of oxygenated versus deoxygenated blood in the near infrared (NIR) region[1]. Tests to optimize the best wavelength of light and the best imaging conditions are being conducted to determine the optimal settings for the device. Image analysis will be used to more accurately measure the amounts of inflammation. Further development also includes the development of an interface to allow for data sharing between patients and physicians of the images and the results.					32nd Southern Biomedical Engineering Conference (SBEC)32nd Southern Biomedical Engineering Conference (SBEC)	MAR 11-13, 2016MAR 11-13, 2016	Ctr Biomed Engn Rehabilitat Sci; Louisiana Tech Univ; LSU Hlth; Biomed Res FdnCtr Biomed Engn Rehabilitat Sci; Louisiana Tech Univ; LSU Hlth; Biomed Res Fdn	Shreveport, LAShreveport, LA	0	0	0	0	0	0			1086-4105		978-1-5090-2133-8	WOS:000381754100022

Typical treatment methods for plantar fasciitis include medications (NSAIDs), exercises, physical therapy, and surgery. Mobile Health (mHealth) technologies stand to improve care for plantar fasciitis via daily monitoring and by addressing barriers to patient adherence with treatment programs. The ability to closely monitor treatment also gives opportunities for curation that were previously unavailable. Pain and inflammation can be decreased by following a simple home exercise routine of stretches specific to the plantar fascia [1]. Our team has developed a system for assistance with monitoring of home exercise program for treatment of plantar fasciitis. The system interfaces Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices with smartphones to send and receive accelerometer and other sensory data, and an accompanying app to be used for at home monitoring and analysis of physical therapy exercises which have been shown to help with plantar fasciitis [2]. Such system can be used to track movement, amplitude, angle, pressure, stretch, and number of repetitions, and overall improve patient adherence to a Home Exercise Program and involvement in treatment. Increased self-monitoring has been shown to directly influence and increase behavior change of patients. In order to increase patient adherence to a prescribed routine, awareness of a behavior and the consistent tracking of its implementation and progress over time are effective [3]. Modern BLE devices are very energy efficient and can work throughout the course of a day, making them an apt choice for a home treatment program. The accompanying app receives, aggregates, and analyzes data from the BLE sensor, and provides actionable feedback to users and clinicians. By increasing patient adherence and speeding up healing, this mHealth system will improve patient outcomes regarding treatment of plantar fasciitis, and also decrease cost of treatment.					32nd Southern Biomedical Engineering Conference (SBEC)32nd Southern Biomedical Engineering Conference (SBEC)	MAR 11-13, 2016MAR 11-13, 2016	Ctr Biomed Engn Rehabilitat Sci; Louisiana Tech Univ; LSU Hlth; Biomed Res FdnCtr Biomed Engn Rehabilitat Sci; Louisiana Tech Univ; LSU Hlth; Biomed Res Fdn	Shreveport, LAShreveport, LA	0	0	0	0	0	0			1086-4105		978-1-5090-2133-8	WOS:000381754100055

Cell viability, tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) alpha, and interleukin- (IL-) 6 were measured in RAW 264.7 macrophages treated with increasing doses (0, 15, 30, and 60 mu g/mL) of sorghum ethanol extracts and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Extract dose had a significant effect on TNF-alpha. and IL-6, with a trend of cytokines decreasing between 0 mu g/mL and 15 mu g/mL of sorghum extract. Genotype also had a significant effect on the cytokines, with extracts from four accessions significantly decreasing TNF-alpha and/or IL-6. Cells treated with 3-deoxyanthocyanidin-containing accessions had less cytokine production than non-3-deoxyanthocyanidin accessions, whereas cells treated with proanthocyanidin-containing accessions had more cytokine production than cells treated with nonproanthocyanidin accessions. Additionally, there was a significant effect of the Tanninl allele on TNF-alpha and IL-6. Our results demonstrate that sorghum genotypes differentially modulate induction of inflammatory cytokine production in RAW 264.7 macrophages and that specialty grain has the potential to be tailored by controlling traits at the nucleotide level. This study adds to our knowledge of sorghum health effects and contributes to efforts aimed at developing health-promoting sorghum grain.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2090-9063	2090-9071		WOS:000381146400001

S	Liu, Jie; Yuan, Lei; Huang, Jie; Xiao, Hai						Gu, B; Helvajian, H; Pique, A		A cantilever based optical fiber acoustic sensor fabricated by femtosecond laser micromachining								LASER 3D MANUFACTURING III		Proceedings of SPIE		9738						UNSP 973804	10.1117/12.2213614			2016	2016	In this paper, we present a pure silica micro-cantilever based optical fiber sensor for acoustic wave detection. The cantilever is directly fabricated by fs laser micromachining on an optical fiber tip functioning as an inline Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI). The applied acoustic wave pressurizes the micro-cantilever beam and the corresponding dynamic signals can be probed by the FPI. The thickness, length, and width of the micro-cantilever beam can be flexibly designed and fabricated so that the sensitivity, frequency response, and the total measurement range can be varied to fit many practical applications. Experimental results will be presented and analyzed. Due to the assembly free fabrication of the fs-laser, multiple micro-cantilever beams could be potentially fabricated in/on a single optical fiber for quasi-distributed acoustic mapping with high spatial resolution.

Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE					114						10.3791/54379			2016 Aug 19	2016	Solution-based electrospray film deposition, which is compatible with continuous, roll-to-roll processing, is applied to chalcogenide glasses. Two chalcogenide compositions are demonstrated: Ge23Sb7S70 and As40S60, which have both been studied extensively for planar mid-infrared (mid-IR) microphotonic devices. In this approach, uniform thickness films are fabricated through the use of computer numerical controlled (CNC) motion. Chalcogenide glass (ChG) is written over the substrate by a single nozzle along a serpentine path. Films were subjected to a series of heat treatments between 100 °C and 200 °C under vacuum to drive off residual solvent and densify the films. Based on transmission Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and surface roughness measurements, both compositions were found to be suitable for the fabrication of planar devices operating in the mid-IR region. Residual solvent removal was found to be much quicker for the As40S60 film as compared to Ge23Sb7S70. Based on the advantages of electrospray, direct printing of a gradient refractive index (GRIN) mid-IR transparent coating is envisioned, given the difference in refractive index of the two compositions in this study.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1940-087X		MEDLINE:27583775	27583775

Most of the attention in origami engineering has focused on the well-known Miura-Ori, a folded tessellation that is flat-foldable for folded sheet and stacked blocks. This study advances the state of the art and expands the research field to investigate generic degree-4 vertex ( 4-vertex) origami, with a focus on facet-binding. In order to understand how facet-binding attributes to the mechanical properties of 4-vertex origami structures, geometries of the 4-vertex origami cells are analyzed and analytically expressed. Through repeating and stacking 4-vertex cells, origami sheets and stacked origami blocks can be constructed. Geometry analyses discover two mechanisms that will lead to the self-locking of 4-vertex origami cells, sheets, and stacked blocks: in-cell facet-binding and inter-cell facet-binding. These two mechanisms and the predicted self-locking phenomena are verified through 3D simulations and prototype experiments. Finally, this paper briefly introduces the unusual mechanical properties caused by the locking of 4-vertex origami structures. The research reported in this paper could foster a new breed of self-locking structures with various engineering applications.

ASME					CAMELS AND FENNEC FOXES: A CASE STUDY ON BIOLOGICALLY INSPIRED DESIGN OF SAND TRACTION SYSTEMS								INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, 2015, VOL 7										V007T06A002				2016	2016	This paper presents a demonstration of how biological solutions to mobility in the desert can be used to drive new concepts for sand-traction tires. Biological inspiration is used to translate both camel hooves (shape) and Fennec Fox paw texture (material) into design concepts for tire traction that are prototyped and tested. The steps used in this are captured in a case study of bio-inspired design, with the resulting concepts compared in terms of their performance. It was found that the camel hoof inspired "concave" shaped tire improved traction that the Fennec Fox paw textured "miner's moss" surface on tires improved traction; and that the integrated solution of the two also improved traction. The greatest improvement was seen with the Fennec Fox textured concepts. Recommendations are made for improvements to steps of bio-inspiration for ideation and future traction concepts.

Urban political ecology in late prehistory: New evidence from El Purgatorio, Peru								JOURNAL OF FIELD ARCHAEOLOGY				41	4			448	466		10.1080/00934690.2016.1195231			2016	2016	One of archaeology's greatest strengths is its reliance on interdisciplinary collaboration and the utilization of multiple lines of evidence to inform archaeological interpretation. For example, through an examination of faunal and floral remains, production and storage facilities, and the isotopic analysis of human skeletal remains one can develop a model for urban political ecology in ancient cultures. In this case study, the political ecology of the Casma capital city, El Purgatorio, Peru, is investigated in order to inform our interpretations and conclusions regarding Casma political, economic and social organization. The results indicate that Casma political ecology was firmly based in coastal resources and oriented towards supporting state-sponsored feasting and ritual activities, suggestive of a largely elite-controlled redistributive economy. In contrast to previous models characterizing this time period as one of factionalism and environmental stress, the data suggest that coastal cultural adaptations produced an era of widespread political and economic stability.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0093-4690	2042-4582		WOS:000380531400004

Characterisation of amphimictic and parthenogenetic populations of Pratylenchus bolivianus Corbett, 1983 (Nematoda: Pratylenchidae) and their phylogenetic relationships with closely related species								NEMATOLOGY				18				651	678					2016	2016	Amphimictic populations of root-lesion nematodes with numerous males and females having three lip annuli, a functional spermatheca and non-areolated lateral field occur on sword fern (Nephrolepis exaltata) in Florida. Identified for decades as Pratylenchus penetrans, they appeared to be a morphologically separated species on the basis of a longer stylet (17.8-18.3 mu m) than P. penetrans (15-17 mu m) and different lip pattern in en face view (rectangular vs dumb-bell in P. penetrans). Morphologically similar amphimictic root-lesion nematodes have also been detected on flax lily in Costa Rica. Subsequent morphological observations indicated that these amphimictic root-lesion nematodes from fern and flax lily are closely related to the parthenogenetic species P. bolivianus, which has areolated lateral fields. In spite of the reproductive and morphological dissimilarities between these populations, their separation into different species was not supported by the results of molecular analyses of their DNA sequences. The populations used in these analyses included those that are amphimictic from Florida and Costa Rica and others that are parthenogenetic from the type locality in Bolivia, and geographically distant localities in Chile, China, Colombia and Europe. Phylogenetic analyses of the ITS and D2-D3 expansion segments of the 28S rRNA gene indicated that they belong to the same species, P. bolivianus, which consists of two morphotypes, P. bolivianus (am) amphimictic and P. bolivianus (pm) parthenogenetic, herein described and illustrated. Contradictory results were obtained by the analyses using a portion of the hsp90 gene. The phylogenetic study, which included sequences of other root-lesion nematodes, a topotype and geographical distant populations of P. zeae, revealed that P. bolivianus and P. zeae formed highly supported clades in the majority consensus trees. PCR with species-specific primers for rapid diagnostics of P. bolivianus and P. zeae were developed and tested.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1388-5545			WOS:000380378100002		
J	Dix, Sean T.; Scott, Joseph K.; Getman, Rachel B.; Campbell, Charles T.								Using degrees of rate control to improve selective n-butane oxidation over model MOF-encapsulated catalysts: sterically-constrained Ag3Pd(111)								FARADAY DISCUSSIONS				188				21	38		10.1039/c5fd00198f			2016	2016	Metal nanoparticles encapsulated within metal organic frameworks (MOFs) offer steric restrictions near the catalytic metal that can improve selectivity, much like in enzymes. A microkinetic model is developed for the regio-selective oxidation of n-butane to 1-butanol with O-2 over a model for MOF-encapsulated bimetallic nanoparticles. The model consists of a Ag3Pd(111) surface decorated with a 2-atom-thick ring of (immobile) helium atoms which creates an artificial pore of similar size to that in common MOFs, which sterically constrains the adsorbed reaction intermediates. The kinetic parameters are based on energies calculated using density functional theory (DFT). The microkinetic model was analysed at 423 K to determine the dominant pathways and which species (adsorbed intermediates and transition states in the reaction mechanism) have energies that most sensitively affect the reaction rates to the different products, using degree-of-rate-control (DRC) analysis. This analysis revealed that activation of the C-H bond is assisted by adsorbed oxygen atoms, O*. Unfortunately, O* also abstracts H from adsorbed 1-butanol and butoxy as well, leading to butanal as the only significant product. This suggested to (1) add water to produce more OH*, thus inhibiting these undesired steps which produce OH*, and (2) eliminate most of the O-2 pressure to reduce the O* coverage, thus also inhibiting these steps. Combined with increasing butane pressure, this dramatically improved the 1-butanol selectivity (from 0 to 95%) and the rate (to 2 molecules per site per s). Moreover, 40% less O-2 was consumed per oxygen atom in the products. Under these conditions, a terminal H in butane is directly eliminated to the Pd site, and the resulting adsorbed butyl combines with OH* to give the desired 1-butanol. These results demonstrate that DRC analysis provides a powerful approach for optimizing catalytic process conditions, and that highly selectivity oxidation can sometimes be achieved by using a mixture of O-2 and H2O as the oxidant. This was further demonstrated by DRC analysis of a second microkinetic model based on a related but hypothetical catalyst, where the activation energies for two of the steps were modified.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1359-6640	1364-5498		WOS:000380099200002	27271786

The test rig utilizes actual vehicle components such as the suspension-tire assembly and braking system to accurately represent a vehicle during a braking event and a chassis dynamometer's drum is used to simulate the longitudinal vehicle dynamics. The key problem addressed in this paper is the emulation of sprung mass motion with a commercial electromagnetic linear actuator. By accurately representing the motion, detailed effects such as load transfer that happens in a real braking process can be studied for its effect on the braking performance. The stability of the system with sprung mass emulation under different actuator control modes is analyzed. The successful and stable control scheme found is a cascaded control with a velocity tracking strategy. The workings of the test are illustrated via representative test results that include a locked-wheel braking event and a stop with an anti-lock braking system (ABS).

In addition to friction identification, a model of the electric power steering system is identified by the use of the instrumented test-rig. It turns out that the friction in the steering system is highly load-dependent, asymmetric with respect to speed, and shows no Stribeck effects. A LuGre model is adopted and fitted to approximate the measured dynamic friction. Consequently, this model is used in a friction compensator which is combined with a linear disturbance observer to estimate the steering rack force. The proposed estimation scheme is analyzed via evaluated system simulations and experiments on the steering system test-rig. Finally, considering the fact that the friction level varies with each steering device manufactured and installed, the paper discusses algorithms for friction level adaptation.

To that end, a harvester consisting of a piezoelectric cantilever beam augmented with a square sectioned bluff body at the free end is considered. Two repulsive magnets located at the tip of the beam are used to introduce the bi-stable restoring force. Turbulence is generated in a wind tunnel using static-grid structures located in the upstream of the bluff body. Three different mesh screens with square bars are designed with different bar and mesh widths to control the Reynolds numbers and associated turbulence intensity. A series of wind tunnel tests are then used to experimentally investigate the response of the harvester with and without the tip magnets. Results demonstrate that the bi-stable restoring force can be used to improve the output power of the harvester for sufficiently large turbulence intensities.

To demonstrate the enhanced performance, an L-shaped cantilevered structure laminated with a piezoelectric patch and augmented with frequency tuning magnets is considered. The magnets serve to adjust the first two modal frequencies of the structure such that the second modal frequency is twice that of the first mode activating a nonlinear energy transfer mechanism. The structure is then subjected to a harmonic excitation with a frequency close to the first modal frequency of the structure. The voltage frequency-response curves are generated for different excitation levels, illustrating an improved bandwidth and output voltage over a case involving no nonlinearly-interacting modes.

Capturing and mitigating damage precursors ahead of micro-crack formulation will slow the evolution of the damage precursors to micro-cracks, mitigate adverse loading environment, and develop techniques to reduce stress and loading below the endurance limit to keep it from being fatigued.

Land trusts are charitable organizations that work to conserve private land locally, regionally, or nationally. The purpose of this paper is to identify the level of structural and cognitive social capital among local land trusts, and how these two types of social capital relate to the perceived success of land trusts. The analysis integrates data for land trusts operating in the U.S. south-central Appalachian region, which includes western North Carolina, southwest Virginia, and east Tennessee. We use factor analysis to elicit different dimensions of cognitive social capital, including cooperation among board members, shared values, common norms, and communication effectiveness. Measures of structural social capital include the size and diversity of organizational networks of both land trusts and their board members. Finally, a hierarchical linear regression model is employed to estimate how cognitive and structural social capital measures, along with other organizational and individual-level attributes, relate to perceptions of land trust success, defined here as achievement of the land trusts' mission, conservation, and financial goals. Results show that the diversity of organizational partnerships, cooperation, and shared values among land trust board members are associated with higher levels of perceived success. Organizational capacity, land trust accreditation, volunteerism, and financial support are also important factors influencing perceptions of success among local, nonprofit land trusts.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1708-3087			WOS:000380049100053

The > 200 000 ha of low-lying tidal freshwater swamps (forests and marshes) in the south-eastern United States could be haloform (CHX3, X = Cl or Br) sources because sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion bring halides inland where they mix with terrestrial humic substances. To evaluate the spatial variation along the common forest-marsh salinity gradient (freshwater wetland, oligohaline wetland and mesohaline saltmarsh), we measured chloroform emissions from in situ chambers and from laboratory incubations of soil and water samples collected from Winyah Bay, South Carolina. The in situ and soil-core haloform emissions were both highest in the oligohaline wetland, whereas the aqueous production was highest in mesohaline saltmarsh. The predominant source shifted from sediment emission to water emission from freshwater wetland to mesohaline saltmarsh. Spreading out soil samples increased soil haloform emission, suggesting that soil pores can trap high amounts of CHCl3. Soil sterilisation did not suppress CHCl3 emission, indicating the important contribution of abiotic soil CHCl3 formation. Surface wetland water samples from eight locations along a salinity gradient with different management practices (natural v. managed) were subjected to radical-based halogenation by Fenton-like reagents. Halide availability, organic matter source, temperature and light irradiation were all found to affect the radical-based abiotic haloform formation from surface water. This study clearly indicates that soil and water from the studied coastal wetlands are both haloform sources, which however appear to have different formation mechanisms.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1448-2517	1449-8979		WOS:000379973200018

Three-parameter-based streamflow elasticity model: application to MOPEX basins in the USA at annual and seasonal scales								HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES				20	6			2545	2556		10.5194/hess-20-2545-2016			2016	2016	We present a three-parameter streamflow elasticity model as a function of precipitation, potential evaporation, and change in groundwater storage applicable at both seasonal and annual scales. The model was applied to 245 Model Parameter Estimation Experiment (MOPEX) basins spread across the continental USA. The analysis of the modified equation at annual and seasonal scales indicated that the groundwater and surface water storage change contributes significantly to the streamflow elasticity. Overall, in case of annual as well as seasonal water balances, precipitation has higher elasticity values when compared to both potential evapotranspiration and storage changes. The streamflow elasticities show significant nonlinear associations with the climate conditions of the catchments indicating a complex interplay between elasticities and climate variables with substantial seasonal variations.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1027-5606	1607-7938		WOS:000379419500025

This research will be used in the development of a computer-based visualization tool to support configuration change management. The researchers hypothesized that the graph geometry and order of the questions being asked would not affect the results, while the color of the graph and the information being represented would affect the number of correct responses. The results showed an increase in the response accuracy for the answerable questions when the amount of information displayed in the data representation was minimized. On the other hand, none of the other factors showed to have a significant effect on the accuracy of the responses. The most significant limitation in this study was the possibility for different users putting different levels of effort into answering the questions.

A heterogeneous object has potentially many advantages and in many cases can realize appearance and/or functionality that homogeneous objects cannot achieve. In this work we employ a preprocess computing combined with a multi-objective optimization algorithm based on the modeling of the LENS deposition of multiple materials to optimize the fabrication process. The optimization methodology is applied to the fabrication of cermet composite (using Inconel 718 and ceramic powders) with prescribed material feeding rates. The multi-objective optimization considers that the energy consumption and the material waste during the fabrication process should be minimized, while the probability of the melting of the powders should be maximized. The optimization software modeFRONTIER (R) is used to drive the computation procedure with a MATLAB code. The results show the design and objective spaces of the Pareto optimal solutions, and enable the users to select preferred setting configurations from the set of optimal solutions.

B	Renu, Rahul Sharan; Mocko, Gregory			ASME					TEXT ANALYSIS OF ASSEMBLY WORK INSTRUCTIONS								INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, 2015, VOL 1B										V01BT02A003				2016	2016	The objective of this research is to investigate the requirements and performance of parts-of-speech tagging of assembly work instructions. Natural Language Processing of assembly work instructions is required to perform data mining with the objective of knowledge reuse. Assembly work instructions are key process engineering elements that allow for predictable assembly quality of products and predictable assembly lead times. Authoring of assembly work instructions is a subjective process. It has been observed that most assembly work instructions are not grammatically complete sentences. It is hypothesized that this can lead to false parts-of-speech tagging (by Natural Language Processing tools). To test this hypothesis, two parts-of-speech taggers are used to tag 500 assembly work instructions (obtained from the automotive industry). The first parts-of-speech tagger is obtained from Natural Language Processing Toolkit (nitk.org) and the second parts-of-speech tagger is obtained from Stanford Natural Language Processing Group (nlp.stanford.edu). For each of these taggers, two experiments are conducted. In the first experiment, the assembly work instructions are input to the each tagger in raw form. In the second experiment, the assembly work instructions are preprocessed to make them grammatically complete, and then input to the tagger. It is found that the Stanford Natural Language Processing tagger with the preprocessed assembly work instructions produced the least number of false parts-of-speech tags.

B	Garland, Anthony; Fadel, Georges			ASME					Manufacturing Functionally Gradient Material Objects with an off the Shelf 3D printer: Challenges and Solutions								INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, 2015, VOL 4														2016	2016	This paper presents the challenges and solutions encountered while printing functionally gradient material (FGM) objects using an off the shelf Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printer. The printer, Build Builder Dual Feed Extruder from 3dprinter4u, has the unique design of extruding two different filaments out of one nozzle. Two separate motors independently pull two different filaments into one chamber causing plastic to extrude out of one nozzle. By using different filaments with different properties, an object with a material properties gradient can be manufactured. These material property gradients can help minimize the difficulty of bonding two different materials directly to each other, and give the designer the ability to tailor individual regions of one object to have different physical properties. Finding an optimal object design that can take advantage of this gradation is a unique problem that goes beyond the traditional solid modeling found in most CAD software. Once a design is obtained, slicing the object and creating an optimal build path is challenging because the gradation must be considered. Several objects were designed and manufactured to test the printers ability to print FGM objects. The python code used to add gradient change commands to the existing Gcode, and to slice a FGM flywheel while taking into account the material gradation has been made open source.

Based on a literature review in decision making methods, an evaluation against method requirements is made. The analysis shows that no single method fulfills all the defined requirements, yet two methods are identified that jointly address all the requirements: Boothroyd's and Dewhurst (B&D) method and the Dynamo method. B&D and Dynamo methods are then combined into a new method, exploiting elements of each. An additional step for graphical modeling of the assembly processes using the Assembly Sequence Modeling Language (ASML) is integrated to facilitate alternative exploration. This newly proposed method is discussed and revealed promising in the field of assembly systems Level of Automation (LoA) measurement and improvement.

B	Sreedhara, Vijay Sarthy Mysore; Mocko, Gregory			ASME					CONTROL OF THERMOFORMING PROCESS PARAMETERS TO INCREASE QUALITY OF SURFACES USING PIN-BASED TOOLING								INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, 2015, VOL 4														2016	2016	Tooling is a significant time and cost investment in manufacturing processes that include casting, injection molding, sheet metal forming, and plastic thermo-forming. These tooling investments are often justified for large production volumes. However, for small volume, prototyping, and custom manufacturing, the tooling investments are hard to justify. To meet the needs of smaller volume production, several adaptable tooling technologies has been developed. One solution, pin-based tooling enables adaptable surfaces for use in plastic thermoforming and composites. However, a key challenge in pin-based tooling is achieving accurate high quality surfaces. The objective in this research is to study the effects of process parameters on surface quality using pin-based tooling. Specifically, in this research polymer surfaces are manufactured without the use of an interpolating layer. A set of experiments was conducted by keeping the shape constant, with and without an interpolator, and varying the process parameters to check the feasibility of producing smooth surfaces. It was observed that smooth, shape-specific surfaces can be produced by optimizing the process parameters. The parameters thus optimized would be shape-specific and optimizing the process parameters for surfaces having complex shapes is a new research challenge that comes out of this work. Future work involves continuing the experiments, measuring the resulting parts and controlling process parameters to increase surface quality.

Integrating observational and interview methods, this study examined four-to-five-year-old children's cognitive play experiences in an outdoor preschool with natural, mixed and manufactured zones. The observational results indicated that the natural and mixed zones offered a diverse spectrum of cognitive play, were supportive of different learning styles and expanded their understanding about the world. Children preferred the diverse, challenging and constantly evolving natural settings in these zones. Integrating diverse natural and manufactured settings with loose elements, the mixed zone supported considerable opportunities for functional, exploratory and games with rules play behaviors. The accessible loose materials inspired children's imagination, social engagement and games. In contrast, the manufactured zone offered the most functional and non-play behaviors, and was perceived as an unexciting, predictable and tedious environment. The findings suggest incorporating natural features and settings in outdoor preschools to support a diverse spectrum of cognitive play.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1472-9679	1754-0402		WOS:000380145700007

We aim at developing an automated tool to extract intracellular components from targeted particles over specific locations, i.e., a DNA microarray or other functionalized spots. What we contribute in this work is modeling of the electric field and its gradient around carbon cones, as well as initial cone fabrication results. To the best of our knowledge, both the fabrication of conical glassy carbon electrodes and the general concept of the proposed platform are novel.

J	Lu, Jie; Atamturktur, Sez; Huang, Yongxi								Bi-Level Resource Allocation Framework for Retrofitting Bridges in a Transportation Network								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD					2550			31	37		10.3141/2550-05			2016	2016	Bridges connect roadways over natural barriers to form transportation networks. Retrofitting at-risk bridges is a proactive strategy to reduce the vulnerability of the traffic network in the face of natural and man-made disasters. The challenge lies in the allocation of limited resources to different bridges that must not only capture the structural performance of a bridge, but also the impact of the bridge on a transportation network. This paper present a novel, bi-level resource allocation framework that integrates the network protection problem based on traffic optimization at the network level with the structural enhancement problem at the bridge level to achieve cost-effective retrofit strategies for at-risk bridges. In particular, a stochastic programming model was used at the upper level to allocate resources to the network of bridges considering the improvement in bridge traffic capacity through the allocated budget. At the lower level, finite element models were developed to estimate a relationship between the structural performance of bridges and retrofit levels. This relationship was converted to a traffic capacity cost relationship and used as an input for the upper-level model. The integrated modeling framework is demonstrated with the Sioux Falls, South Dakota, road network, in which critical factors (such as budget levels) on the retrofit strategy were analyzed.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0361-1981	2169-4052		WOS:000379889700006

ASME					DUAL RESIDUAL FOR DISTRIBUTED AUGMENTED LAGRANGIAN COORDINATION BASED ON OPTIMALITY CONDITIONS								INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, 2015, VOL 2B										UNSP V02BT03A034				2016	2016	Augmented Lagrangian Coordination (ALC) is one of the more popular coordination strategies for decomposition based optimization. It employs the augmented Lagrangian relaxation approach and has shown great improvements in terms of efficiency and solution accuracy when compared to other methods addressing the same type of problem. Additionally, by offering two variants: the centralized ALC in which an artificial master problem in the upper level is created to coordinate all the sub-problems in the lower level, and the distributed ALC in which coordination can be performed directly between sub-problems without a master problem, ALC provides more flexibility than other methods. However, the initial setting and the update strategy of the penalty weights in ALC still significantly affect its performance and thus are worth further research.For centralized ALC, the non-monotone weight update strategy based on the theory of dual residual has shown very good improvements over the traditional monotone update, in which the penalty weights can either increase or decrease. In this paper, we extend the research on the dual residual in centralized ALC to the distributed ALC. Through applying the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions to the All In-One (AIO) and decomposed problems, the necessary conditions for the decomposed solution to be optimal are derived, which leads to the definition of primal and dual residuals in distributed ALC. A new non-monotone weight based on both residuals is then proposed, by which all AIO KKT conditions are guaranteed after decomposition. Numerical tests are conducted on two mathematical problems and one engineering problem and the performances of the new update are compared to those of the traditional update. The results show that our proposed methods improve the process efficiency, accuracy, and robustness for distributed ALC.

This paper reviews and critically compares common numerical methodologies and optimization techniques used to design these meso-structures by analyzing the methods themselves and published applications and results. Most of the reviewed research targets mechanical material properties, including effective stiffness and crushing energy absorption. The numerical methodologies reviewed include topology and size/shape optimization methods such as homogenization, Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization, and level sets. The optimization techniques reviewed include genetic algorithms (GAs), particle swarm optimization (PSO), gradient based, and exhaustive search methods. The research reviewed shows notable patterns. The literature reveals a push to apply topology optimization in an ever-growing number of 3-dimensional applications. Additionally, researchers are beginning to apply topology optimization and size/shape optimization to multi physics problems. The research also shows notable gaps. Although PSOs are comparable evolutionary algorithms to GAs, the use of GAs dominates over PSOs. These patterns and gaps, along with others, are discussed in terms of possible future research in the design of meso-structured materials.

Mini-review: fluorescence imaging in cancer cells using dye-doped nanoparticles								RSC ADVANCES				6	70			65459	65474		10.1039/c6ra10473h			2016	2016	Fluorescence imaging has gained increased attention over the past two decades as a viable means to detect a variety of cancers. Fluorescence imaging has the potential to provide physicians with high resolution images with enhanced contrast, which will allow them to be able to better diagnose and treat patients with cancer. Early detection and treatment are key to eradicating cancer in a patient, and fluorescence imaging has the ability to identify non-advanced, even pre-cancerous, tumors where imaging based on white light or radiation overlooked them. Several fluorescent dyes have been identified as possible fluorophores for enhanced fluorescence imaging, such as cyanine, squaraine, porphyrin, phthalocyanine, and borondipyrromethane dyes. These dyes have high fluorescence quantum yields, which provides a high target to background ratio; however, these dyes are often plagued by low water solubility. This low solubility can be ameliorated by conjugating or covalently attaching these dyes to polymeric crosslinked micelles, polymersomes, or polymer-core nanoparticles. These particle & dye systems then can become platforms on which secondary components can be attached to enhance the systems functionality. For example, dyes attached to these nanocarriers can target tumors through passive targeting; however, active targeting can be achieved by further modifying these nanocarriers with ligands that have a binding affinity for receptors overexpressed in tumor cells, cell surface receptors located on the tumor cell membrane, or endothelium. Fluorescence activation of the probes is another promising technology for the early detection of cancer. Activation requires that there be a change in fluorescence, whether it be an emission wavelength change or a fluorescence "on/off" signal when in the presence of some external stimuli. Activation increases the target to background ratio and enhances the contrast of the obtained image. This review serves to highlight the recent developments of (1) improved fluorescent dyes for the detection of cancer, with a specific focus on dyes that are being coupled to nanocarriers; (2) dye & nanocarrier systems that target, both actively and passively, tumors, and (3) fluorescence activation of these fluorophore systems for better image quality.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2046-2069			WOS:000379577800023		
J	Htet, Yamin; Tennyson, Andrew G.					Tennyson, Andrew/0000-0002-8593-2979			Catalytic radical reduction in aqueous solution via oxidation of biologically-relevant alcohols								CHEMICAL SCIENCE				7	7			4052	4058		10.1039/c6sc00651e			2016	2016	Metalloenzymes that normally perform catalytic antioxidant or radical-degrading functions, as well as small-molecule complexes that mimic them, can also exert pro-oxidant or radical-forming effects depending on the identity of the terminal reductant. Because nitroxyl radicals function as redox active cocatalysts in the aerobic oxidation of alcohols, we hypothesized that catalytic radical reduction could be achieved via the oxidation of biologically-relevant alcohols. Herein we report an organoruthenium complex (Ru1) that catalyzed reduction of 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzo-thiazoline-6-sulfonate) radical monoanion (ABTS(center dot-)) to ABTS(2-) in phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) using MeOH, EtOH, i-PrOH, serine, threonine, glucose, arabinose, methyl lactate or dimethyl malate as the terminal reductant. Replacing either the C-H or O-H groups of a -CHOH- moiety resulted in the loss of ABTS(center dot-) reducing ability. Moreover, in conjunction with an alcohol terminal reductant, Ru1 was able to inhibit the oxidation of ABTS(2-) by H2O2 and horseradish peroxidase, even after multiple successive challenges with excess H2O2 or ABTS(center dot-).

Optical birefringence was created in a singlemode fiber by introducing a series of symmetric cuboid stress rods on both sides of the fiber core and along the fiber axis using a femtosecond laser. The stress-induced birefringence was estimated to be 2.4x10(-4) at the optical wavelength of 1550 nm. By controlling the length of the stress rods, waveplates of the desired retardance can be fabricated. The stress-induced birefringence was further explored to fabricate in-fiber polarizers based on the polarization-dependent long-period fiber grating (LPFG) structure. For the in-fiber polarizer based on low order mode LPFG, a polarization extinction ratio of more than 25 dB was observed at the wavelength of 1527.8 nm. A high order mode LPFG based in-fiber polarizer, with a broad bandwidth of 100 nm near 1550 nm, was investigated as well. The in-fiber polarization devices with low insertion loss may be useful in optical communications and fiber optic sensing applications.

Duric, N; Heyde, B		Towards predictive diagnosis and management of rotator cuff disease: Using curvelet transform for edge detection and segmentation of tissue								MEDICAL IMAGING 2016: ULTRASONIC IMAGING AND TOMOGRAPHY		Proceedings of SPIE		9790						97901P	10.1117/12.2217125			2016	2016	Degradation and injury of the rotator cuff is one of the most common diseases of the shoulder among the general population. In orthopedic injuries, rotator cuff disease is only second to back pain in terms of overall reduced quality of life for patients. Clinically, this disease is managed via pain and activity assessment and diagnostic imaging using ultrasound and MRI. Ultrasound has been shown to have good accuracy for identification and measurement of rotator cuff tears. In our previous work, we have developed novel, real-time techniques to biomechanically assess the condition of the rotator cuff based on Musculoskeletal Ultrasound. Of the rotator cuff tissues, supraspinatus is the first that sees degradation and is the most commonly affected. In our work, one of the challenges lies in effectively segmenting and characterizing the supraspinatus. We are exploring the possibility of using curvelet transform for improving techniques to segment tissue in ultrasound. Curvelets have been shown to give optimal multi-scale representation of edges in images. They are designed to represent edges and singularities along curves in images which makes them an attractive proposition for use in ultrasound segmentation. In this work, we present a novel approach to the possibility of using curvelet transforms for automatic edge and feature extraction for the supraspinatus.

J	Morris, Eric A.; Brown, Jeffrey R.; Taylor, Brian D.								Negotiating a Financial Package for Freeways How California's Collier-Burns Highway Act Helped Pave the Way for the Era of the American Interstate Highway								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD					2552			16	22		10.3141/2552-03			2016	2016	With the Collier Burns Highway Act of 1947, California pioneered a new system of highway finance. In response to estimates of enormous highway needs in the postwar period, the state planned substantial increases in funding. The key debate was about who would pay what share. Legislators planned a significant increase in the motor fuel tax and a shift of more of the tax burden onto heavy vehicles, which inflicted most damage to roads. However, the proposal met with intense opposition from motorist groups, oil companies, and truckers. California eventually passed legislation that established the first-ever trust fund dedicating highway user tax revenue to roads, a law that was later copied widely, including by Congress in 1956, when the Interstate system was funded. The trucking industry in California defeated proposals to require it to shoulder more of the financial burden; this outcome too would be repeated elsewhere, including at the federal level. Finally, the inclusion of urban freeways eased the California legislation's passage, and this provision also became a key element of the federal Interstate legislation. Thus, the legacy of Collier Burns reaches well beyond California to influence transportation and public finance across the United States to the present day.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0361-1981	2169-4052		WOS:000378668300003		
J	Mitchell, Joshua A.; Bausman, Dennis C.; Islam, Sababa; Chowdhury, Mashrur								Process for Developing Asynchronous Online Training for Transportation Agency Professionals Case Study								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD					2552			23	31		10.3141/2552-04			2016	2016	Efficient training is an essential component of work force development for transportation agencies. The South Carolina Department of Transportation (DOT) recognized one such training need in its management of contracts for professional services consultants. This recognition led to a research effort to identify standardized procedures in the procurement and administration of these contracts, resulting in the development of a training manual and daylong pilot training session. Although the session received positive feedback, it limited the time and location for delivery. This traditional, in-class method is no longer the only available option. Asynchronous online training presents agencies with the option of providing training to employees regardless of their spatial or schedule variabilities while minimizing the need for instructor effort and availability. In light of this change, the South Carolina DOT commissioned a subsequent research effort to study best practices for development, delivery, and assessment of online training and to use these findings to create training modules of the previously completed manual and training session. The focus of this paper is to present the process for developing asynchronous online training employed for the 10 modules, which total roughly 5 h. Although this process is based on best practices, they are not discussed at length; rather, references to findings are made where they pertain. The process, unique lessons learned, and advisable practices are discussed. The paper's presentation of the online development process can be applied to other transportation agencies intending to implement asynchronous online training for professional development.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0361-1981	2169-4052		WOS:000378668300004

Cardiovascular psychiatry and neurology				2016				4720941	4720941		10.1155/2016/4720941			2016	2016	The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships among subclinical PTSD symptoms, blood pressure, and several variables linked to both frank PTSD and the basic psychobiological adaptation to stress. The authors recruited a sample of 91 healthy, young men and women between 18 and 35 years. We examined links among subclinical posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, blood pressure, sleep quality, and hostility. Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms were associated with poorer sleep quality and higher hostility scores in both women and men. In men, PTSD symptoms were also associated with elevated resting diastolic blood pressure, and sex was an important moderator of that relationship. Moreover, sleep quality and hostility are substantive mediators of the relationship between diastolic blood pressure and PTSD. Behavioral interventions designed to increase sleep quality and restructure hostile attitudes could potentially serve as preventive interventions for PTSD and the underlying cardiovascular comorbidities in young adults.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2090-0163			MEDLINE:27403340	27403340

This article relays the latest interpretation on design and use of the ballast system onboard the Hunley; findings from historical research on the components, operation and design of the aft pump, and avenues for further research. Understanding the ballast system and pump may prove highly relevant in answering questions regarding the loss of the vessel and her crew.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0309-0728	1745-8196		WOS:000378056700004

The simulation integrates sub-models for the plant stations and energy management center based on regression analysis of two-year data, forecasting, and physical modelling. The hybrid simulation is developed to account for the energy consumed in manufacturing, air-tempering, and in maintaining equipment with large thermal inertia in an idle-state. The model is applied in twofold; a Daily volume production and a Sequence record and delay modes. The results are found in agreement with plant-recorded data.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1939-7038	1939-7046		WOS:000378212700004

One particulate system consisting of a poly(propargyl acrylate) (PA) core with covalently attached derivatized fluorescein and modified bovine serum albumin covalently conjugated to a cyanine 3 derivative was initially non fluorescent. Upon trypsin addition and subsequent proteolytic digestion, Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) was induced. The other particulate system consisted of a PA core with covalently attached azide modified BSA, which was covalently attached to a silicon phthalocyanine derivative (PA/BSA/akSiPc600). Both systems were biocompatible. To investigate activated fluorescence with the PA/BSA/akSiPc600 system in cancer cells, human non-small cell lung cancer cells (A549 cell line) were used as a model system. The PA/BSA/akSiPc600 system was incubated with the cells at varying time points in an effort to see a fluorescence increase over time as the cells uptake the particles and as they digest the BSA, most probably, via endocytosis. It was seen, through live cell scanning confocal microscopy, that the fluorescence was activated in the cell.

We present a study of nitrogen doped graphene samples grown using chemical vapor deposition with a variety of synthesis conditions. Soft X-ray absorption and emission spectroscopy, which are techniques sensitive to the unoccupied and occupied partial electronic density of states, respectively, were used to study the electronic structure of N-doped graphene. Complementary full-potential, all-electron density functional theory calculations of the measured spectra reveal the existence of graphitic, pyridinic and nitrilic-like sites in the samples studied. Although our study shows that the defect type is sensitively related to the synthesis conditions, the graphitic configuration is found to be the most dominant one in each system studied. The dependence of the defect type on the sample growth conditions and the corresponding shifts in the Fermi energy level from the Dirac point, result in n- or p-type material being obtained.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2046-2069			WOS:000378275400123

Polyurea/Fused-silica interfacial decohesion induced by impinging tensile stress-waves								AIMS MATERIALS SCIENCE				3	2			486	507		10.3934/matersci.2016.2.486			2016	2016	All-atom non-equilibrium molecular-dynamics simulations are used to investigate the problems of polyurea-borne tensile-stress waves interacting with a polyurea/fused-silica interface and fused-silica tensile-stress waves interacting with a fused-silica/polyurea interface, and the potential for the accompanying interfacial decohesion. To predict the outcome of the interactions of stress-waves with the material-interfaces in question, at the continuum level, previously determined material constitutive relations for polyurea and fused-silica are used within an acoustic-impedance-matching procedure. These continuum-level predictions pertain solely to the stress-wave/interface interaction aspects resulting in the formation of transmitted and reflected stress-or release-waves, but do not contain any information regarding potential interfacial decohesion. Present direct molecular-level simulations confirmed some of these continuum-level predictions, but also provided direct evidence of the nature and the extent of interfacial decohesion. In the molecular-level simulations, reactive force-field potentials are utilized to properly model the initial state of interfacial cohesion and its degradation during stress-wave-loading. Examination of the molecular-level interfacial structure before the stress-wave has interacted with the given interface, revealed local changes in the bonding structure, suggesting the formation of an "interphase." This interphase was subsequently found to greatly affect the polyurea/fused-silica decohesion strength and the likelihood for interfacial decohesion during the interaction of the stress-wave with the interface.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2372-0468	2372-0484		WOS:000377692900012

Derivation, parameterization and validation of a creep deformation/rupture material constitutive model for SiC/SiC ceramic-matrix composites (CMCs)								AIMS MATERIALS SCIENCE				3	2			591	619		10.3934/matersci.2016.2.591			2016	2016	The present work deals with the development of material constitutive models for creep-deformation and creep-rupture of SiC/SiC ceramic-matrix composites (CMCs) under general three-dimensional stress states. The models derived are aimed for use in finite element analyses of the performance, durability and reliability of CMC turbine blades used in gas-turbine engines. Towards that end, one set of available experimental data pertaining to the effect of stress magnitude and temperature on the time-dependent creep deformation and rupture, available in the open literature, is used to derive and parameterize material constitutive models for creep-deformation and creep-rupture. The two models derived are validated by using additional experimental data, also available in the open literature. To enable the use of the newly-developed CMC creep-deformation and creep-rupture models within a structural finite-element framework, the models are implemented in a user-material subroutine which can be readily linked with a finite-element program/solver. In this way, the performance and reliability of CMC components used in high-temperature high-stress applications, such as those encountered in gas-turbine engines can be investigated computationally. Results of a preliminary finite-element analysis concerning the creep-deformation-induced contact between a gas-turbine engine blade and the shroud are presented and briefly discussed in the last portion of the paper. In this analysis, it is assumed that: (a) the blade is made of the SiC/SiC CMC; and (b) the creep-deformation behavior of the SiC/SiC CMC can be represented by the creep-deformation model developed in the present work.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2372-0468	2372-0484		WOS:000377692900019

To deal with the infinite-dimensional nature of the process model associated with the moisture diffusion in the coating film, POD-Galerkin method is first applied for model reduction. Then, an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is devised for distributed moisture content estimation and nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) system is designed for tracking a desired average moisture content profile with optimized energy needs. To enhance the control performance in the presence of potential modeling uncertainties, a robust design is also included in the proposed NMPC scheme. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated via simulated applications to IR drying of automotive waterborne coatings.					8th ASME Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Conference (DSCC 2015)8th ASME Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Conference (DSCC 2015)	OCT 28-30, 2015OCT 28-30, 2015	ASME, Dynam Syst & Control DivASME, Dynam Syst & Control Div	Columbus, OHColumbus, OH	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-5725-0	WOS:000377639100067

The original SPM consists of two electrodes approximated as spherical particles with spatially distributed Li-ion concentration. However, the Li-ion concentration states in these two-electrode models are known to be weakly observable from the voltage output. This has led to the prevalent use of reduced models in literature that generally approximate Li-ion concentration states in one electrode as an algebraic function of that in the other electrode. In this paper, we remove such approximations and show that the addition of the thermal model to the electrochemical SPM essentially leads to observability of the Li-ion concentration states in both electrodes from voltage and temperature measurements. Then, we propose an estimation scheme based on this SPM coupled with lumped thermal dynamics that estimates the Li-ion concentrations in both electrodes. Moreover, these Li-ion concentration estimates also enable the estimation of the cell capacity. The estimation scheme consists of a sliding mode observer cascaded with an Unscented Kalman filter (UKF). Simulation studies are included to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.					8th ASME Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Conference (DSCC 2015)8th ASME Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Conference (DSCC 2015)	OCT 28-30, 2015OCT 28-30, 2015	ASME, Dynam Syst & Control DivASME, Dynam Syst & Control Div	Columbus, OHColumbus, OH	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-5725-0	WOS:000377639100034

The selected task is to assemble a few LEGO parts into a final assembled product following specified instructions and sequence in collaboration between the human and the robot. We develop a two-level feedforward optimization strategy that determines the optimal subtask allocation between the human and the robot for the selected assembly before the assembly starts. We derive dynamics models for human's trust in the robot and the robot's trust in the human for the assembly and estimate the trusts. The aim is to maintain satisfactory trust levels between the human and the robot through the application of the optimal subtask allocation. Again, subtask re-allocation is proposed to regain trusts if the trusts reduce to below the specified levels. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that fluctuations in human's trust in the robot may cause fluctuations in human's speeds and the human may appreciate if the robot adjusts its speeds with changes in human speeds. Hence, trust based Model Predictive Control (MPC) is proposed to minimize the variations between human and robot speeds and to maximize the trusts. Experiment results prove the effectiveness of the hybrid cell, the feedforward optimal subtask allocation and of the trust-based MPC. The results also show that the overall assembly performance can be enhanced and the performance status can be monitored through a single dynamic parameter, i.e. the trust.					8th ASME Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Conference (DSCC 2015)8th ASME Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Conference (DSCC 2015)	OCT 28-30, 2015OCT 28-30, 2015	ASME, Dynam Syst & Control DivASME, Dynam Syst & Control Div	Columbus, OHColumbus, OH	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-5725-0	WOS:000377639100070

The presented strategy makes use of a real-time simulation of a wind turbine model to provide reference signals for the test bench. These reference signals include the thrust force, lateral force, vertical force, pitch moment, yaw moment, and drivetrain speed at the nacelle's control point or hub point: a point along a nacelle's drivetrain representing what would be the center of the nacelle hub. The effectiveness of this approach is studied with the help of a multibody, dynamic model of the 7.5 MW test bench located at Clemson University's Wind Turbine Drive train Testing Facility. Simulation results show that the proposed control strategy is feasible for emulating field conditions on a wind turbine test bench.					8th ASME Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Conference (DSCC 2015)8th ASME Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Conference (DSCC 2015)	OCT 28-30, 2015OCT 28-30, 2015	ASME, Dynam Syst & Control DivASME, Dynam Syst & Control Div	Columbus, OHColumbus, OH	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-5725-0	WOS:000377639100012

To incorporate driver characteristics into system controller design, two self-learning algorithms are used to estimate driver's preferred time headway. We then develop a human-like blending control for CACC based on a model predictive control (MPC)-type method, which integrates the driver comfort, traffic efficiency, and fuel economy criteria. Furthermore, a driving assistance controller is developed to help human driver to maintain string stability in platoon. Simulation results show that (i) the human-like CACC design can significantly improve driving experience, and (ii) with the help of the assistive controller, string stability is satisfied for both exclusively autonomous CACC and when the CACC switches to manual driving in a platoon.					8th ASME Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Conference (DSCC 2015)8th ASME Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Conference (DSCC 2015)	OCT 28-30, 2015OCT 28-30, 2015	ASME, Dynam Syst & Control DivASME, Dynam Syst & Control Div	Columbus, OHColumbus, OH	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-5725-0	WOS:000377639100062

The motion of the cart has often been studied under the assumption that the magnitude of friction is as high as necessary to prevent slipping. We relax this assumption by setting a maximum finite value to the friction. The Chaplygin sleigh is then under a piecewise smooth nonholonomic constraint and transitions between 'slip' and 'stick' modes. We investigate these transitions and the resulting non smooth dynamics of the system. Further more the piecewise smooth constraint offers the possibility of controlling the speed of the sleigh and we investigate this with numerical simulations.					8th ASME Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Conference (DSCC 2015)8th ASME Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Conference (DSCC 2015)	OCT 28-30, 2015OCT 28-30, 2015	ASME, Dynam Syst & Control DivASME, Dynam Syst & Control Div	Columbus, OHColumbus, OH	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-5726-7	WOS:000377639200064

The objective of this paper is to provide an accurate dynamic model with low computational overhead. Our approach is to place point masses at the center of gravity of the continuum section, rather than along the robot's backbone or centerline. This enables the model to match the robot's energetic characteristics with many fewer point masses. We experimentally validate the model using a pneumatic muscle actuated continuum arm. We find that the proposed model successfully captures both the transient and steady state dynamics of the arm.					8th ASME Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Conference (DSCC 2015)8th ASME Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Conference (DSCC 2015)	OCT 28-30, 2015OCT 28-30, 2015	ASME, Dynam Syst & Control DivASME, Dynam Syst & Control Div	Columbus, OHColumbus, OH	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-5726-7	WOS:000377639200088

We develop a one human-one robot hybrid cell using a humanoid robot with affection display ability where the human and the robot collaborate to assemble few parts into a final product. Based on an optimization strategy, the assembly subtasks are optimally allocated between the human and the robot. We determine a computational dynamics model of the robot's affections for various situations associated with the assembly. Taking inspiration from the affection dynamics, we develop an affection-based motion control strategy for the robot so that the robot can dynamically adjust its affective expressions with task situations. We develop a comprehensive evaluation scheme to evaluate HRI and assembly performance in two different conditions of the robot: (i) the robot displays affections in its face dynamically with assembly task situations, (ii) the robot does not display affection. The results show that the motion control of the robot with dynamic affective expressions produce significantly better HRI and assembly performance than that produced by the motion control of the robot with no affective expression.					8th ASME Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Conference (DSCC 2015)8th ASME Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Conference (DSCC 2015)	OCT 28-30, 2015OCT 28-30, 2015	ASME, Dynam Syst & Control DivASME, Dynam Syst & Control Div	Columbus, OHColumbus, OH	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-5726-7	WOS:000377639200021

Based on the current information of the controlled vehicle and its environment (obstacles, and lane markings, etc), the assigner selects discrete maneuver states through pre-defined switching rules. The several maneuver states are related to different setups for the underlying model predictive trajectory guidance module. The guidance module uses a reduced-order curvilinear particle motion description of the controlled vehicle and obstacle objects as well as a corresponding description of the reference path, lane and traffic limits.

Journal of innovation in health informatics				23	1			185	185		10.14236/jhi.v23i1.185			2016 Apr 06	2016	UNLABELLED:INTRODUCTION: The implementation of health information technologies (HITs) has changed the dynamics of doctor-patient communication in outpatient settings. Designing patient-facing HITs provides patients with easy access to healthcare information during the visit and has the potential to enhance the patient-centred care.OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study are to systematically review how the designs of patient-facing HITs have been suggested and evaluated, and how they may potentially affect the doctor-patient communication and patient-centred care.METHOD: We conducted an online database search to identify articles published before December 2014 relevant to the objectives of this study. A total of nine papers have been identified and reviewed in this study.RESULTS: Designing patient-facing HITs is at an early stage. The current literature has been exploring the impact of HITs on doctor-patient communication dynamics. Based on the findings of these studies, there is an emergent need to design more patient-centred HITs. There are also some papers that focus on the usability evaluation of some preliminary prototypes of the patient-facing HITs. The design styles of patient-facing HITs included sharing the health information with the patients on: (1) a separate patient display, (2) a projector, (3) a portable tablet, (4) a touch-based screen and (5) a shared computer display that can be viewed by both doctors and patients. Each of them had the strengths and limitations to facilitate the patient-centred care, and it is worthwhile to make a comparison of them in order to identify future research directions.CONCLUSION: The designs of patient-facing HITs in outpatient settings are promising in facilitating the doctor-patient communication and patient engagement. However, their effectiveness and usefulness need to be further evaluated and improved from a systems perspective.									0	0	0	0	0	0				2058-4563		MEDLINE:27348487	27348487

It is critical for BMSs to be able to diagnose battery electrochemical faults that can potentially lead to catastrophic failures. In this paper, an observer-based fault diagnosis scheme is presented that can detect, isolate and estimate some internal electrochemical faults. The scheme uses a reduced-order electrochemical thermal model for a Li-ion battery cell. The paper first presents a modeling framework where the electrochemical faults are modeled as parametric faults. Then, multiple sliding mode observers are incorporated in the diagnostic scheme. The design and selection of the observer gains as well as the convergence of the observers are verified theoretically via Lyapunov's direct method. Finally, the performance of the observer-based diagnostic scheme is illustrated via simulation studies.					8th ASME Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Conference (DSCC 2015)8th ASME Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Conference (DSCC 2015)	OCT 28-30, 2015OCT 28-30, 2015	ASME, Dynam Syst & Control DivASME, Dynam Syst & Control Div	Columbus, OHColumbus, OH	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-5724-3	WOS:000377639000064

A hierarchical control architecture is proposed in this paper where the higher level controller is considered to be a part of the transportation infrastructure while the lower level controllers are considered to be present in every HEV. The higher level controller uses model predictive control strategy to evaluate the energy efficient velocity profiles for every vehicle for a given horizon. Each lower level controller then tracks its velocity profile (obtained from the higher level controller) in a fuel efficient fashion using equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS).

Torque security is one of the main hazards that should be considered for functional safety of electrified vehicles. Over the past decades, a significant number of accidents have been reported to be caused by unintended acceleration that results from torque security problems. This paper investigates the factors related to torque security problems in electric vehicles using the Failure Modes and Effect Analysis (FMEA) approach.

This paper describes the growth, characterization and corrosion analyses of beta-TCP doped with different compositions of Ag thin film coatings. The phase composition and microstructure analyses were performed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) respectively. The SEM images showed that varying the percentage of Ag dopant affects the surface morphology of the beta-TCP coatings. The corrosion protection behavior of the coated samples were evaluated using electrochemical measurement techniques, such as potentiodynamic polarization (PD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The corrosion tests were performed in Hank's Balanced salt solution using a three electrode electrochemical cell. The results showed that the beta-TCP coating and beta-TCP doped with Ag coatings on the Mg disks exhibit a much superior stability and lower corrosion rate compared to bare Mg. It was observed that increasing the mass of the Ag dopant increases the corrosion protection, but 10 wt% Ag doping in beta-TCP reduces the corrosion protection behavior. The SEM images of the samples after corrosion show that the beta-TCP and beta-TCP doped with 10 wt% Ag suffered the most corrosion attack compare to beta-TCP doped with 1 wt% and 5 wt% Ag. In conclusion, we have developed beta-TCP and beta-TCP doped with 1 wt%, 5 wt% and 10 wt% Ag coating with tunable corrosion protection efficiency above 88%.

The effects of three model biopolymers: casein (protein), catechin (polyphenol), and dextran (polysaccharide) on fouling of asymmetric 0.65 m polyethersulfone membranes during direct-flow filtration have been studied. While dextran is successful in disrupting interactions between casein and catechin, the associated reduction in aggregate size does not always result in reduced fouling. Solution conditions such as pH and ionic strength modulate the tendency of the aggregates to adsorb onto the membrane surface. Thus, optimizing solution conditions to suppress adsorption of aggregates is essential for increasing the membrane filtration capacity.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0149-6395	1520-5754		WOS:000377279500012

The paper aims to discuss this issue.Design/methodology/approach - The subject of the present work is armor-grade composite materials reinforced using ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene fibers and having four (two 2D and two 3D) prototypical architectures, as well as the derivation of the corresponding material models. The effect of the reinforcement architecture is accounted for by constructing the appropriate unit cells (within which the constituent materials and their morphologies are represented explicitly) and subjecting them to a series of virtual mechanical tests (VMTs). The results obtained are used within a post-processing analysis to derive and parameterize the corresponding homogenized-material models. One of these models (specifically, the one for 0 degrees/90 degrees cross-collimated fiber architecture) was directly validated by comparing its predictions with the experimental counterparts. The other models are validated by examining their physical soundness and details of their predictions. Lastly, the models are integrated as user-material subroutines, and linked with a commercial finite-element package, in order to carry out a transient non-linear dynamics analysis of ballistic transverse impact of armor-grade composite-material panels with different reinforcement architectures.Findings - It is found that the reinforcement architecture plays a critical role in the overall ballistic limit of the armor panel, as well as in its structural and damage/failure response.Originality/value - To the authors(knowledge, the present work is the first reported attempt to assess, computationally, the utility and effectiveness of 3D fiber-reinforcement architectures for ballistic impact applications.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0264-4401	1758-7077		WOS:000377046700015

Relevant recommendations for implementing HIT in rural hospitals are provided and discussed to achieve meaningful use.Design/methodology/approach - An observational study is conducted to map medication administration process while using a HIT system in a rural hospital. Follow-up focus groups are held to determine and verify potential adverse factors related to using the HIT system while passing drugs to patients.Findings - A detailed task analysis demonstrated several violations, such as only relying on the barcode scanning system to match up with patient and drugs could potentially result in the medical staff forgetting to provide drug information verbally before administering drugs. There was also a lack of regulated and clear work procedure in using the new HIT system. In addition, the computer system controls and displays could not be adjusted so as to satisfy the users' expectations. Nurses prepared medications and documentation in an environment that was prone to interruptions.Originality/value - Recommendations for implementing a HIT system in rural healthcare facilities can be categorized into five areas: people, tasks, tools, environment, and organization. Detailed remedial measures are provided for achieving continuous process improvements at resource-limited healthcare facilities in rural areas.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0952-6862	1758-6542		WOS:000377199900008	27142953

A Heuristic Task Scheduling Algorithm for Heterogeneous Virtual Clusters								SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING										7040276	10.1155/2016/7040276			2016	2016	Cloud computing provides on-demand computing and storage services with high performance and high scalability. However, the rising energy consumption of cloud data centers has become a prominent problem. In this paper, we first introduce an energy-aware framework for task scheduling in virtual clusters. The framework consists of a task resource requirements prediction module, an energy estimate module, and a scheduler with a task buffer. Secondly, based on this framework, we propose a virtual machine power efficiency-aware greedy scheduling algorithm (VPEGS). As a heuristic algorithm, VPEGS estimates task energy by considering factors including task resource demands, VM power efficiency, and server workload before scheduling tasks in a greedy manner. We simulated a heterogeneous VM cluster and conducted experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of VPEGS. Simulation results show that VPEGS effectively reduced total energy consumption by more than 20% without producing large scheduling overheads. With the similar heuristic ideology, it outperformed Min-Min and RASA with respect to energy saving by about 29% and 28%, respectively.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1058-9244	1875-919X		WOS:000376907500001

The attributes examined are: an online marketplace, social media advertisement of farms, different operators of the marketing platforms, an online directory, and monthly fee levels. The results in this study indicate heterogeneity in producers' preferences. Specifically, farmers can be divided into two distinct groups: producers interested in electronic food trading platforms, and producers who are not interested in them. Producers in the first group are willing to pay $70 per month for an online marketplace and $152 per month for the service. Lastly, farmers have a slight preference for a for-profit operator when compared to a not-for-profit operator.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1559-2448			WOS:000375405700006

Given the AT and MV of a set of known products, complexity values can he used to predicted AT and MV for a set of unknown products using an Artificial Neural Network. This paper presents a precision analysis of four prediction models that are a combination of the aforementioned design representations and AT and MV. A sensitivity analysis of the complexity metrics was done using Multiple Linear Regression, and a set of significant metrics was identified. Lastly, a comparison of accuracy and precision for the four prediction models obtained using this set of sensitivity analysis is presented. (C) 2016 The Authors.

J	Peng, Yunhui; Norris, Joy; Schwartz, Charles; Alexov, Emil								Revealing the Effects of Missense Mutations Causing Snyder-Robinson Syndrome on the Stability and Dimerization of Spermine Synthase								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES				17	1					77	10.3390/ijms17010077			JAN 2016	2016	Missense mutations in spermine synthase (SpmSyn) protein have been shown to cause the Snyder-Robinson syndrome (SRS). Depending on the location within the structure of SpmSyn and type of amino acid substitution, different mechanisms resulting in SRS were proposed. Here we focus on naturally occurring amino acid substitutions causing SRS, which are situated away from the active center of SpmSyn and thus are not directly involved in the catalysis. Two of the mutations, M35R and P112L, are reported for the first time in this study. It is demonstrated, both experimentally and computationally, that for such mutations the major effect resulting in dysfunctional SpmSyn is the destabilization of the protein. In vitro experiments indicated either no presence or very little amount of the mutant SpmSyn in patient cells. In silico modeling predicted that all studied mutations in this work destabilize SpmSyn and some of them abolish homo-dimer formation. Since dimerization and structural stability are equally important for the wild type function of SpmSyn, it is proposed that the SRS caused by mutations occurring in the N-domain of SpmSyn is a result of dysfunctional mutant proteins being partially unfolded and degraded by the proteomic machinery of the cell or being unable to form a homo-dimer.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1422-0067			WOS:000374583800074

On narrow blades, the menisci are mostly shaped by the wetting and capillary forces; gravity plays a secondary role. To describe a meniscus in this asymptotic case, the model of Alimov and Kornev ["Meniscus on a shaped fibre: Singularities and hodograph formulation," Proc. R. Soc. A 470, 20140113 (2014)] has been employed. It is shown that at the sharp edges of the blade, the contact line makes a jump. In the wetting case, the contact line sitting at each side of the blade is lifted above the points where the meniscus first meets the blade edges. In the non-wetting case, the contact line is lowered below these points. The contours of the constant height emanating from the blade edges generate unusual singularities with infinite curvatures at some points at the blade edges. The meniscus forms a unique surface made of two mirror-symmetric sheets fused together. Each sheet is supported by the contact line sitting at each side of the blade.

These culture conditions provide the best percent survival after acclimatization in the greenhouse. However, clone response to temperature and light quality within culture conditions varies. Micropropagated plants have mass and morphology similar to 2- or 3-year-old seedlings. Acclimatized plantlets can then be grown in the greenhouse using sub-irrigation (ebb and flood) to maintain substrate volumetric water content>44 %. Growth cycle in the greenhouse must be about 100 days, followed by dormancy for 5 months at 5 °C.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1940-6029		MEDLINE:27108318	27108318

Room-temperature catalytic oxidation of alcohols with the polyoxovanadate salt Cs-5(V14As8O42Cl)								CATALYSIS SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				6	9			3208	3213		10.1039/c5cy01533b			2016	2016	While many known methods for oxidation mediated by polyoxometalates (POMs) employ environmentally friendly co-oxidants, they tend to employ large catalyst loadings (e.g. 40 mol%) and costly high reaction temperatures (similar to 90-135 degrees C) that potentially contribute to the degradation of the catalyst and reduce their effectiveness. Herein, we present some initial results demonstrating a room temperature catalytic oxidation using the reduced salt-inclusion polyoxometalate, Cs-5(V14As8O42Cl), that contains polyoxovanadate (POV) clusters as an efficient catalyst (e.g., 2 mol%) in the transformation of secondary alcohols to their corresponding ketones in very good to quantitative yields. Further, the catalyst can be suspended on celite and recycled.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2044-4753	2044-4761		WOS:000375545600036

By varying the alkenyl groups on the dendrimers, the gelation time displayed a large range from 8 seconds to 18 hours, and the modulus of the hydrogels ranged from 36 to 183 Pa under experimental conditions. Investigation by H-1-NMR spectroscopy revealed that the gelation time and the stiffness of the hydrogels were governed by the degree of electron deficiency of alkenyl groups on the dendrimers. This research provided a systematic study on the relationship between chemical structures versus gelation time and mechanical properties of hydrogels, which could guide the way to synthesize in situ forming hydrogels with designated gelation time and stiffness for biomedical applications. Further, a RGD peptide was attached to the PAMAM dendrimers to enhance cell attachment and proliferation. Viability assays of Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVEC) in the synthesized hydrogels demonstrated the biocompatibility of the hydrogels after 48 hours of culturing, and the RGD peptide improved the viability of HUVEC cells in hydrogels. We believe the PAMAM/HA hydrogel system is a tuneable and biocompatible system for diverse biomedical applications.									1	1	0	0	0	2			0920-5063	1568-5624		WOS:000374584900003	26923639

Priming professionals for a complex communication environment: Findings from a pilot study								JOURNAL OF INTERPROFESSIONAL CARE				30	3			397	400		10.3109/13561820.2015.1133573			2016	2016	Factors such as time pressure, distractions, and profession-specific jargon can contribute to poor communication in complex working environments such as healthcare. Technical solutions are often sought to improve patient care when simple improvements in communication would suffice. This article describes an icebreaker activity, an interprofessional game, aimed to prime and engage experienced healthcare professionals on the topic of communication, specifically related to care transitions. By using unexpected content from veterinary care, cycling messages rapidly, and by adding distractors, we were successful in creating openness to considering communication needs in new ways. Participants completed an evaluation following this intervention. It was found that the activity was effective at raising awareness of communication problems and the activity caused participants to view care transitions communications in new ways. In particular, it was reported that this activity illustrated opportunities for communication improvement at multiple levels including peer-to-peer and with patients. This interprofessional activity can illustrate communication barriers, both within and beyond healthcare, in an interactive and engaging manner.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1356-1820	1469-9567		WOS:000375903100021	27152545

However, there is limited empirical support for this argument. A Bayesian ordered probit formulation is used in this study to determine the importance of fresh vegetable producers' and farm operation characteristics on the probability of adopting marketing contracts. The findings of the study indicate that younger farmers, with larger farm size and with the ability to expand their operations are more likely to participate in marketing contract agreements. On the other hand, the results do not support the risk shifting hypothesis.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1559-2448			WOS:000375405500003

This species was found widely in South East and South Asia from the Philippines through the Greater Sunda islands, a western part of Lesser Sundas, the Malay Peninsula to Sri Lanka. Mikania species (Asteraceae), Mikania micrantha in particular, were the most frequently used host plants, but some other plants belonging to Lamiaceae or Acanthaceae were also used by some local populations. Each population is possibly monophagous. According to morphological analyses, seven populations from four host plants at six sites on four Indonesian islands were grouped into two, one occurring on Java and Kalimantan (Borneo) and another on Sulawesi and Lombok, indicating that they were separated by the Wallace line. This morphological distinction was not correlated with the host plant use.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-2933	1464-5262		WOS:000375487400005

Using this model, we focused on a "primary gel" and illuminated the sample to activate the TTCs, which then interacted with monomer and cross-linker in the solution. At low TTC concentrations, gels composed of compatible monomers formed two distinct, spatially separated layers. Conversely, at high TTC concentration, gels formed from incompatible components displayed a well-intermixed structure. Hence, in the presence of light, variations in the TTC concentration provide a new approach for controllably tailoring the structure of polymer gels, and thereby tailoring the functionality of the network.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1759-9954	1759-9962		WOS:000374878100006

Obesity Stigma as a Barrier to Healthy Eating Behavior								TOPICS IN CLINICAL NUTRITION				31	1			86	94		10.1097/TIN.0000000000000060			JAN-MAR 2016	2016	Obesity stigma is highly prevalent in society and is acted upon by friends, family, teachers, and medical professionals. Widely held stereotypes and internalization thereof can negatively affect behavior change. Ways in which weight-related stigma consciousness, body esteem, and attitudes toward obese people play a role in eating behaviors were explored. Results showed that possession of a negative attitude toward obese people was related to stigma consciousness, low body esteem, and higher perceived barriers to healthy eating. Weight stigma and internalization of weight stigmata can be disempowering, and potentially undermine efforts to treat and prevent obesity.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0883-5691	1550-5146		WOS:000373300300008		
J	Mocko, Gregory M.; Linnerud, Blake J.								Measuring the Effects of Goal Alignment on Innovative Engineering Design Projects								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION				32	1			55	63					2016	2016	Many senior level capstone design courses encourage students to develop innovative solutions to open design projects from industry partners. Student teams that function at a high level are more likely to develop innovative solutions. Prior researchers have proposed that there are four stages to the development of groups: forming, storming, norming, and performing. It has been seen that students often get "stuck" in the storming stage and only after they coalesce as a team and set common goals (Norming Phase) can they perform at the highest level to achieve said goals (Performing Phase). The research presented in this paper, focuses on two main areas: (1) understanding what motivates undergraduate engineering students when working on design projects and (2) determining the effects of goal alignment interventions on design teams. A study of senior-level mechanical engineering students was conducted to determine if the effects of setting common goals could be quantified. Five of the total eighteen design teams were selected and guided to set common goals during their design project. Each team was composed of four or five mechanical engineering students. It was found that the teams that received "interventions" had an increase in level of performance (p-value = 0.14) and motivation (p-value = 0.19) when compared to teams that were left to their own devices. The main conclusions are summarized as: (1) interventions can be effectively used to explicitly set common goals for the group, (2) interventions have immediate positive effects on the levels of performance and levels of motivation, and (3) a positive correlation between performance and motivation is found.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0949-149X			WOS:000374234200007

In this study, we attempted to improve forty-nine first year undergraduate engineering students' critical thinking skills through two assignments based on the Paul-Elder model of critical thinking, which incorporates characteristics of eight elements of thought of critical thinking and has been contextualized specifically for use in engineering. Two methods were employed: problem-based learning and writing for reflectivity. Students first worked in teams to solve two engineering problems, and then each individual student wrote first and final report drafts for each of the problem solving tasks. Writing fellows provided structured feedback to students on each of their first draft reports based on one of two grading rubrics used to assess reports. Over the course of the semester, students showed improvement in overall critical thinking skills and in some, but not all, of the eight elements of critical thinking according to both grading rubrics. Based on these results, we offer suggestions for the teaching of critical thinking skills to undergraduates in engineering and a call for future empirical research.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0949-149X			WOS:000374234200009

We hypothesized that an interactive simulation promotes more organized switching of attention between different elements of multimedia learning material, e.g., textual description and pictorial visualization. Participants studied a description of an algorithm accompanied either by an interactive simulation, self-paced animation, or static illustration. Using a novel framework for entropy-based comparison of gaze transition matrices, results showed that the interactive simulation elicited more careful visual investigation of the learning material as well as reading of the problem description through to its completion.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1995-8692			WOS:000373398900003

The basis of the MICHAEL approach is the realization that environmental, nutritional and electromagnetic factors form a regulatory framework involved in bone and nerve healing. The interactions of light, energy, and nutrition with neural, hormonal and cellular pathways will be presented. Energetic therapies including electrical, low-intensity pulsed ultrasound and light based treatments affect growth, differentiation and proliferation of bone and nerve and can be utilized for their healing benefits. However, the benefits of these therapies can be impaired by the absence of nutritional, hormonal and organismal factors. For example, lack of sleep, disrupted circadian rhythms and vitamin-D deficiency can impair healing. Molecular targets, such as the Wnt pathway, protein kinase B and glucocorticoid signaling systems can be modulated by nutritional components, including quercetin, curcumin and Mg2+ to enhance the healing process. The importance of water and water-regulation will be presented as an integral component. The effects of exercise and acupuncture on bone healing will also be discussed within the context of the MICHAEL approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Sequestering survivin to functionalized nanoparticles: a strategy to enhance apoptosis in cancer cells								BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE				4	4			614	626		10.1039/c5bm00580a			2016	2016	Survivin belongs to the family of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP) and is present in most cancers while being below detection limits in most terminally differentiated adult tissues, making it an attractive protein to target for diagnostic and, potentially, therapeutic roles. Sub-100 nm poly(propargyl acrylate) (PA) particles were surface modified through the copper-catalyzed azide/alkyne cycloaddition of an azide-terminated survivin ligand derivative (azTM) originally proposed by Abbott Laboratories and speculated to bind directly to survivin (protein) at its dimer interface. Using affinity pull-down studies, it was determined that the PA/azTM nanoparticles selectively bind survivin and the particles can enhance apoptotic cell death in glioblastoma cell lines and other survivin over-expressing cell lines such as A549 and MCF7 relative to cells incubated with the original Abbott-derived small molecule inhibitor.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2047-4830	2047-4849		WOS:000372997600007	26845086

Recent research has shown that hot acetic acid (AcOH)-water mixtures can be used to recover "ultraclean" lignins of controlled molecular weight from Kraft lignins. A key feature of this discovery is the existence of a region of liquid-liquid equilibrium (LLE), with one phase being rich in the purified lignin and the other rich in solvent. Although visual methods can be used to determine the temperature at which solid lignin melts in the presence of AcOH-water mixtures to form LLE, the phase transition can be seen only at lower AcOH concentrations due to solvent opacity. Thus, an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique was developed for measuring the phase-transition temperature of a softwood Kraft lignin in AcOH-water mixtures. In electrochemical cells, the resistance to double-layer charging (i.e., polarization resistance R-p) is related to the concentration and mobility of free ions in the electrolyte, both of which are affected by the phases present. When the lignin-AcOH-water mixture was heated through the phase transition, R-P was found to be a strong function of temperature, with the maximum in R-P corresponding to the transition temperature obtained from visual observation. As the system is heated, acetate ions associate with the solid lignin, forming a liquefied, lignin-rich phase. This association increases the overall impedance of the system, as mobile acetate ions are stripped from the solvent phase and thus are no longer available to adsorb on the polarizing electrode surfaces. The maximum in RP occurs once the new lignin-rich phase has completely formed, and no further association of the lignin polymer with AcOH is possible. Except at sub-ambient temperatures, the phase-transition temperature was a strong function of solvent composition, increasing linearly from 18 degrees C at 70/30 AcOH/water to 97 degrees C at 10/90 wt% AcOH/water.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000372981400009		
J	Wheeler, A. G., Jr.								LIORHYSSUS HYALINUS (F.) (HEMIPTERA: RHOPALIDAE) IN THE WESTERN UNITED STATES: NEW HOST RECORDS, HOST-PLANT RANGE, AND COMMENTS ON USE OF THE TERM "HOST PLANT"								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON				118	1			115	128		10.4289/0013-8797.118.1.115			JAN 2016	2016	Liorhyssus hyalinus (F.) is a nearly cosmopolitan, polyphagous rhopalid, or scentless plant bug, that feeds mainly on flowers, fruits, and seeds of its hosts. Adults are known from numerous plants in diverse families, whereas nymphs develop on fewer species. Thirteen species of host plants were recorded for L. hyalinus during the sampling of grasses, forbs, subshrubs, and shrubs in the western United States (west of 100th meridian) from 2000 to 2015. The 11 new host records are Lygodesmia juncea, Machaeranthera tanacetifolia, Sonchus asper, Stephanomeria exigua, S. pauciflora, and S. thurberi (Asteraceae); Chamaesyce albomarginata (Euphorbiaceae); Erodium botrys and E. texanum (Geraniaceae); and Malva parviflora and Sphaeralcea ambigua (Malvaceae). The most common host (9 collections) was the adventive Erodium cicutarium, previously reported as a host in the Old World. Another previously known host was Sonchus oleraceus. Hosts of L. hyalinus in western states comprise four principal groups: latex-bearing (milky) composites of the tribe Cichorieae (Asteraceae); latex-bearing, mat-forming euphorbs or spurges (Euphorbiaceae); herbs and subshrubs of mallows (Malvaceae); and species of the stork's bill genus Erodium (Geraniaceae). Nymphs were observed on grasses (Poaceae) once: in a small, still-green colony of an undetermined species during prolonged drought in California. Based on fieldwork and a review of the literature, the common name hyaline grass bug appears to be a misnomer. The presence of adults on plant species that apparently do not support nymphal development is discussed in relation to the bug's bionomics, proximity to crop fields, and weather conditions. Although somewhat different definitions of "host plant" might be needed for different insect groups, a more consistent and restrictive interpretation of the term is recommended.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0013-8797			WOS:000373242800008

Professional development for the early childhood workforce has been shown to positively influence the quality of early childhood classrooms. This study examines 320 providers and 1022 recipients (including childcare teachers, Head Start teachers and 4k teachers in public school districts) who completed surveys examining the types of professional development opportunities they experienced over the previous year. Findings from these surveys were used to determine a subsample of providers (n = 20) and recipients (n = 27) who were interviewed to gain a deeper understanding of these experiences. Findings from this study indicate overall dissatisfaction with the quality and purpose of current professional development opportunities. Participants describe a lack of access to high-quality experiences and suggest that professional development requirements should be restructured to be based on recipient needs rather than focus on a prescribed set of topics. In addition, data suggest that follow-up support or evaluation of professional development experiences rarely occurs in these settings. Implications for practice and future research are discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1941-5257	1941-5265		WOS:000373307400008

Systematic studies revealed that the formation of 2H CuFeO2 was affected by reactant concentrations, basicity, temperature and the reaction time. The material was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, Raman and absorption spectroscopy. 2H CuFeO2 has a band gap of 1.33 eV, high absorption coefficient of 3.8 x 10(4) cm(-1) at 700 nm and is highly photostable. When incorporated into an indium tin oxide/ZnO/2H CuFeO2/graphite/carbon black structure an open circuit photovoltage of 0.29 V was observed. The material appears promising for solar applications.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2046-2069			WOS:000372812300089

We prove stability and optimal convergence of the scheme, and also connect the scheme to one based on handling each decoupled system with a penalty-projection method. Numerical experiments are given which verify all predicted convergence rates of our analysis on some analytical test problems, show the results of the scheme on a set of channel flow problems match well the results found when the computation is done with MHD in primitive variable, and finally show the scheme performs well on a channel flow over a step.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1705-5105			WOS:000373022700006

Application of the Materials-by-Design Methodology to Redesign a New Grade of the High-Strength Low-Alloy Class of Steels with Improved Mechanical Properties and Processability								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				25	1			165	178		10.1007/s11665-015-1812-7			JAN 2016	2016	An alternative to the traditional trial-and-error empirical approach for the development of new materials is the so-called materials-by-design approach. Within the latter approach, a material is treated as a complex system and its design and optimization is carried out by employing computer-aided engineering analyses, predictive tools, and available material databases. In the present work, the materials-by-design approach is utilized to redesign a grade of high-strength low-alloy (HSLA) class of steels with improved mechanical properties (primarily strength and fracture toughness), processability (e.g., castability, hot formability, and weldability), and corrosion resistance. Toward that end, a number of material thermodynamics, kinetics of phase transformations, and physics of deformation and fracture computational models and databases have been developed/assembled and utilized within a multi-disciplinary, two-level material-by-design optimization scheme. To validate the models, their prediction is compared against the experimental results for the related steel HSLA100. Then the optimization procedure is employed to determine the optimal chemical composition and the tempering schedule for a newly designed grade of the HSLA class of steels with enhanced mechanical properties, processability, and corrosion resistance.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1059-9495	1544-1024		WOS:000372307800021

Multi-length-scale Material Model for SiC/SiC Ceramic-Matrix Composites (CMCs): Inclusion of In-Service Environmental Effects								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				25	1			199	219		10.1007/s11665-015-1850-1			JAN 2016	2016	In our recent work, a multi-length-scale room-temperature material model for SiC/SiC ceramic-matrix composites (CMCs) was derived and parameterized. The model was subsequently linked with a finite-element solver so that it could be used in a general room-temperature, structural/damage analysis of gas-turbine engine CMC components. Due to its multi-length-scale character, the material model enabled inclusion of the effects of fiber/tow (e.g., the volume fraction, size, and properties of the fibers; fiber-coating material/thickness; decohesion properties of the coating/matrix interfaces; etc.) and ply/lamina (e.g., the 0 degrees/90 degrees cross-ply versus plain-weave architectures, the extent of tow crimping in the case of the plain-weave plies, cohesive properties of the inter-ply boundaries, etc.) length-scale microstructural/architectural parameters on the mechanical response of the CMCs. One of the major limitations of the model is that it applies to the CMCs in their as-fabricated conditions (i.e., the effect of prolonged in-service environmental exposure and the associated material aging-degradation is not accounted for). In the present work, the model is upgraded to include such in-service environmental-exposure effects. To demonstrate the utility of the upgraded material model, it is used within a finite-element structural/failure analysis involving impact of a toboggan-shaped turbine shroud segment by a foreign object. The results obtained clearly revealed the effects that different aspects of the in-service environmental exposure have on the material degradation and the extent of damage suffered by the impacted CMC toboggan-shaped shroud segment.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1059-9495	1544-1024		WOS:000372307800024

Obtaining realistic results from simulations of temporary work zones is difficult. Thus, it would be valuable for gaining more valid simulation data if a method of calibrating the desired speed distribution could be applied for traffic simulation model of highway temporary work zones. The calibration method was proposed in five steps: (1) collect and analyse data, (2) plot the travel speed cumulative frequency curves and calibrate the desired speed distribution, (3) conduct simulation runs, (4) validate the simulation results, and (5) propose a new calibration method, which was assessed by T-tests, and the results are very promising. Finally, a simplified calibration method called "Five-Point Method" is presented and the recommended values of five-point are given.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0353-5320	1848-4069		WOS:000372477200006

Included among the many offices and bureaus in 2014 were 78 regulatory agencies with more than 276,000 employees who in recent years turned out annually some 80,000 Federal Register pages of rules and rule modifications. A successful president, e.g., one who can be reelected or help to pave the way for the party in the next election, must find ways to steer bureau activities in his preferred direction while delivering on regulatory promises made in the process of being elected. White House review of proposed regulations provides an opportunity for presidents to affect regulatory outcomes in ways that reward politically important interest groups. Our review of all empirical work on White House review as well as our own institutional and statistical findings yield strong support to the notion that the review process provides opportunities to make presidential preferences operational.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0048-5829	1573-7101		WOS:000372322300005

The rapid development of high average power cryogenic laser sources seems likely to play a crucial role in realizing the long-sought goal of powerful ultrafast sources that offer concomitant high peak and average powers. In this paper, we review the optical, thermal, thermo-optic and laser parameters important to cryogenic laser technology, recently achieved laser and laser materials progress, the progression of cryogenic laser technology, discuss the importance of cryogenic laser technology in ultrafast laser science, and what advances are likely to be achieved in the near-future.									1	1	0	0	0	2			2076-3417			WOS:000372148500012

Although Cu(I/II), Co(II), Ag(I), and Zn(II) coordination to thione and selone ligands has been broadly studied and Fe(II) plays an important role in oxidative damage, very few iron-thione complexes and no iron-selone complexes are reported. Novel Fe(II)-containing thione and selone complexes of the formulae FeL2Cl2, [FeL2(CH3CN)(2)](2+), and [FeL4](2+), and {FeL'Cl-2}(n), (L = N,N'-dimethylimidazole selone (dmise), and thione (dmit); L' = bis(thioimidazolyl)ethane (ebit) and bis(selenoimidazolyl)ethane (ebis)) have been synthesized and characterized. Structures of Fe(dmise)(2)Cl-2, Fe(dmit)(2)Cl-2, [Fe(dmit)(4)][BF4](2), [Fe(dmise)(4)][BF4](2), and {Fe(ebit)Cl-2}(n) were determined by X-ray crystallography. All Fe(II) centers adopt a distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry with Fe-S distances ranging from 2.339(1) to 2.397(1) angstrom and Fe-Se distances ranging from 2.453(1) to 2.514(1) angstrom. Density functional theory optimized structures of FeL2Cl2, [FeL2(CH3CN)(2)](2+), and [FeL4](2+) are consistent with experimental results and suggest that thiones and selones are pi-donor ligands that coordinate through their zwitterionic resonance structures. Thione and selone coordination to Fe(II) lowers the Fe(II/III) reduction potential, with a greater decrease for Fe(II)-bound dmise than Fe(II)-bound dmit. Dmit and dmise ligand-based oxidation potentials also significantly increase upon Fe(II) binding compared, indicating that bound thione and selone ligands will undergo oxidation prior to Fe(II). The synthesis of these complexes suggests that iron coordination by thione and selone ligands may occur in vivo and may contribute to the protective antioxidant properties of sulfur and selenium.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000372191500029	26859480

A novel mode of embryonic nutrition in the tiger shark, Galeocerdo cuvier								MARINE BIOLOGY RESEARCH				12	2			200	205		10.1080/17451000.2015.1099677			2016	2016	How are tiger shark embryos nourished to large size without a placental connection? Tiger sharks belong to the family Carcharhinidae, and all carcharhinid sharks are placental with the exception of the tiger shark. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that tiger shark embryos are nourished to large size by imbibing a clear uterine fluid found in their egg cases. Based on weights of fertilized eggs and of term embryos, the tiger shark is a matrotrophic species, and its embryos appear to reach gains of 2119% in wet weight and 1092% in dry weight during gestation. By measuring the total energy content of the fluid in the egg case by chemical oxygen demand (COD), the authors demonstrate that clear liquid in the tiger shark egg case is an energy-rich embryotrophe that nourishes the embryos to large size. We suggest that the process be termed embryotrophy'. The process appears to be an adaptation for producing large broods of large embryos in a species lacking a placental connection.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1745-1000	1745-1019		WOS:000372363500010

The helium displays strong affinity to the oxygen: vacancy (O:Vac) pair. By investigating various local environments of the vacancy, we find that the energy cost for He cluster growth increases with the appearance of solutes in the reference unit. He atom tends to join the He cluster in the directions away from the solute atoms. Meanwhile, the He cluster tends to expand in the directions away from the solute atoms. A growth criterion is proposed based on the elastic instability strain of the perfect iron lattice in order to determine the maximum number of He atoms at the vacancy site. We find that up to seven He atoms can be trapped at a single vacancy. However, it is reduced to five if the vacancy is pre-occupied by an oxygen atom. Furthermore, the solute atoms within nanoclusters, such as Ti and Y, will greatly limit the growth of the He cluster. A migration energy barrier study is performed to discuss the reduced mobility of the He atom/He cluster in 14YWT.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1996-1944			WOS:000372095300003

Membranes				6	1						10.3390/membranes6010019			2016 Mar 10	2016	This article reports findings on the use of nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) for secondary treatment of high-strength rendering facility wastewaters following an ultrafiltration step. These wastewaters present significant challenges to classical treatment technologies. Constant-pressure, direct-flow membrane filtration experiments were done to screen for flux and effluent water permeate quality of ten commercial NF and RO membranes. All membranes tested were effective in reducing total dissolved salts (TDS) and chemical oxygen demand (COD); however, only two membranes (Koch MPF-34 and Toray 70UB) gave sufficiently stable flux values to warrant longer term cross-flow filtration studies. Cross-flow flux measurements, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and attenuated total reflectance-Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) indicated that both membranes were eventually fouled by organic and inorganic foulants; however, the Toray 70UB RO membrane yielded a capacity of 1600 L/m prior to cleaning. A preliminary economic analysis compared the estimated costs of energy and consumables for a dual-stage UF/RO membrane process and dissolved air floatation (DAF) and found membrane process costs could be less than about 40% of the current DAF process.									0	0	0	0	0	0				2077-0375		MEDLINE:26978407	26978407	
J	Grujicic, Mica; Ramaswami, S.; Snipes, Jennifer								Nacre-like ceramic/polymer laminated composite for use in body-armor applications								AIMS MATERIALS SCIENCE				3	1			83	113		10.3934/matersci.2016.1.83			2016	2016	Nacre is a biological material constituting the innermost layer of the shells of gastropods and bivalves. It consists of polygonal tablets of aragonite, tessellated to form individual layers and having the adjacent layers as well as the tablets within a layer bonded by a biopolymer. Due to its highly complex hierarchical microstructure, nacre possesses an outstanding combination of mechanical properties, the properties which are far superior to the ones that are predicted using the techniques such as the rule of mixture. In the present work, an attempt is made to model a nacre-like composite armor consisting of boron carbide (B4C) tablets and polyurea tablet/tablet interfaces. The armor is next investigated with respect to impact by a solid right-circular-cylindrical rigid projectile, using a transient non-linear dynamics finite element analysis. The ballistic-impact response and the penetration resistance of the armor is then compared with that of the B4C monolithic armor having an identical areal density. Furthermore, the effect of various nacre microstructural features (e.g. surface profiling, micron-scale asperities, mineral bridges between the overlapping tablets lying in adjacent layers, and B4C nano-crystallinity) on the ballistic-penetration resistance of the composite-armor is investigated in order to identify an optimal nacre-like composite-armor architecture having the largest penetration resistance. The results obtained clearly show that a nacre-like armor possesses a superior penetration resistance relative to its monolithic counterpart, and that the nacre microstructural features considered play a critical role in the armor penetration resistance.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2372-0468	2372-0484		WOS:000371620200006

Phosphorylcholine (PC) has shown promise as a viable strategy for enhancing the biofunctionality of surfaces and structures. Here we developed a new and facile strategy for grafting superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) by phosphonic acid terminated poly(2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl phosphorylcholine) brushes, synthetized by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. Properties of covalently bound IONPs with PC, PEG or PEG : PC brush-like structures via a "grafting onto" approach through robust bidentate Fe-O-P bonds were compared. The presence of modified polymers on the functionalized IONP surfaces was proved using both ATR-FTIR and TGA. The resultant synthesized IONPs were characterized for their physicochemical and biological aspects. Interestingly, compared with PEG combs, specifically, PC brushes rendered comparable or enhanced suspendability, stability, biocompatibility and cellular distribution. We attribute these characteristics to the biomimetic nature and larger polarity of PC in contrast to the synthetic and hydrophilic PEG. These synthesis strategies and characterizations may prove beneficial to the design and applications of IONPs in nanobiotechnology and nanomedicine.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1759-9954	1759-9962		WOS:000371815300011		
J	Cates, Ezra L.; Li, Feifei								Balancing intermediate state decay rates for efficient Pr3+ visible-to-UVC upconversion: the case of beta-Y2Si2O7:Pr3+								RSC ADVANCES				6	27			22791	22796		10.1039/c6ra01121g			2016	2016	Materials that convert visible light into ultraviolet radiation have recently been studied for potential application to new catalytic and antimicrobial technologies. Conversion efficiencies of reported phosphors, however, have remained much lower than the more well-known IR-to-visible upconversion systems, due to a lack of lanthanide activator ions well suited for the required energy transfer mechanisms. Herein, the ceramic pyrosilicate beta-Y2Si2O7:Pr3+ was prepared for the first time and its visible-to-UVC upconversion efficiency was optimized. The resulting material showed the most efficient upconversion of this type to date, with a 3.9-fold improvement over the compositionally similar X2-Y2SiO5:Pr3+ benchmark material. Analysis of both the steady-state and time-dependent luminescence behavior revealed that a relatively short-lived P-3(J) intermediate state - normally considered detrimental to Pr3+ upconversion - in fact contributed to its efficacy. The pyrosilicate host also resulted in a much longer D-1(2) luminescence lifetime, the origins of which are speculated to relate to the precise spacing of the 4f states. Based on the results, we discuss revised criteria for the "ideal" Pr3+ photophysical behavior and host requirements for maximizing UVC conversion efficiency.									2	0	0	1	0	2			2046-2069			WOS:000371716300067

In this study, we demonstrate two catalysts prepared via pyrolysis of Polyaniline and Vinazene with carbon. Their excellent Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities and potential cycling stability were confirmed using thin film rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) in 0.1M KOH and 0.1M HClO4. Structural-performance correlation analysis confirms that not only graphitic nitrogen is responsible for high ORR, but also other nitrogen functions including pyrrolic one. However, catalyst that is rich in graphitic-N shows more stability especially in acidic medium. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, a calcareous tube built by the tubeworm, Hydroides elegans, was used as an example to evaluate the individual and interactive effects of ocean acidification (OA), warming and reduced salinity on the mechanical properties of a tube. Tubeworms produce a mechanically weaker tube with less resistance to simulated predator attack under OA (pH 7.8). Warming (29 degrees C) increased tube volume, tube mineral density and the tube's resistance to a simulated predatory attack. A weakening effect by OA did not make the removal of tubeworms easier except for the earliest stage, in which warming had the least effect. Reduced salinity (27 psu) did not affect tubes. This study showed that both mechanical analysis and computational modeling can be integrated with biofouling research to provide insights into how fouling communities might develop in future ocean conditions.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0892-7014	1029-2454		WOS:000371088600009	26820060

Materials and Methods: Women with unexplained infertility (UI) underwent laparoscopic excision or ablation with CO2 laser or electrocautery of all suspected endometriotic lesions, followed by clinical treatment between January 2007 and December 2013; pregnancy (>12 weeks) within 12 months of monitored cycles was the main outcome measured. Results: Women with histological confirmation (n=74) did not differ from those not confirmed (n=29) with age, body mass index, gravidity, parity, ovulation induction protocol, and past duration of infertility. Pregnancy outcome was similar in both groups (39/74 vs. 15/29 -p = 0.9 - Chi-square) and there was no statistical difference in time to conceive/deliver (p = 0.7) between groups. Conclusions: There is no difference in fertility outcomes in women with UI, whether or not suspected endometriosis is confirmed pathologically.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0390-6663			WOS:000370911900007	27048014

Small-scale fluctuations in barium drifts at high latitudes and associated Joule heating effects								JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS				121	1			779	789		10.1002/2015JA021868			JAN 2016	2016	Most previous estimates of Joule heating rates, especially the contribution of small-scale structure in the high-latitude ionosphere, have been based on incoherent scatter or coherent scatter radar measurements. An alternative estimate can be found from the plasma drifts obtained from ionized barium clouds released from sounding rockets. We have used barium drift data from three experiments to estimate Joule heating rates in the high-latitude E region for different magnetic activity levels. In particular, we are interested in the contribution of small-scale plasma drift fluctuations, corresponding to equivalent electric field fluctuations, to the local Joule heating rate on scales smaller than those typically resolved by radar or other measurements. Since Joule heating is a Lagrangian quantity, the inherently Lagrangian estimates provided by the chemical tracer measurements are a full description of the effects of electric field variance and neutral winds on the heating, differing from the Eulerian estimates of the type provided by ground-based measurements. Results suggest that the small-scale contributions to the heating can be more than a factor of 2 greater than the mean field contribution regardless of geomagnetic conditions, and at times the small-scale contribution is even larger. The high-resolution barium drift measurements, moreover, show that the fine structure in the electric field can be more variable than previous studies have reported for similar conditions. The neutral winds also affect the heating, altering the height-integrated Joule heating rates by as much as 12%, for the cases studied here, and modifying the height distribution of the heating profile as well.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2169-9380	2169-9402		WOS:000371146900056

Arginine-linked neomycin B dimers: synthesis, rRNA binding, and resistance enzyme activity								MEDCHEMCOMM				7	1			164	169		10.1039/c5md00427f			2016	2016	The nucleotides comprising the ribosomal decoding center are highly conserved, as they are important for maintaining translational fidelity. The bacterial A-site has a small base variation as compared with the human analogue, allowing aminoglycoside (AG) antibiotics to selectively bind within this region of the ribosome and negatively affect microbial protein synthesis. Here, by using a fluorescence displacement screening assay, we demonstrate that neomycin B (NEO) dimers connected by L-arginine-containing linkers of varying length and composition bind with higher affinity to model A-site RNAs compared to NEO, with IC50 values ranging from similar to 40-70 nM, and that a certain range of linker lengths demonstrates a clear preference for the bacterial A-site RNA over the human analogue. Furthermore, AG-modifying enzymes (AMEs), such as AG O-phosphotransferases, which are responsible for conferring antibiotic resistance in many types of infectious bacteria, demonstrate markedly reduced activity against several of the L-arginine-linked NEO dimers in vitro. The antimicrobial activity of these dimers against several bacterial strains is weaker than that of the parent NEO.									2	0	0	1	0	2			2040-2503	2040-2511		WOS:000370707500016	26811742

To better understand the influence of different parameters on droplet generation and on the size and size distribution of the droplets in our microfluidic system, the behavior of the disperse phase and the continuous phase was simulated in a 3D computational multiphase droplet generation model. The experimentally determined droplet sizes showed good correlation with the computational model, agreeing within 1-17 % of each other, depending on the production parameters. In addition to pure polymer microspheres, for the first time our design allowed for the production of quasi-monosized magnetic microspheres containing magnetic nanoparticles with more than 15 wt%. The magnetic microspheres maintained superparamagnetic behavior and produced heat upon exposure to an alternating magnetic field which will allow for their future application in magnetically targeted hyperthermia treatment in cancer therapy.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1613-4982	1613-4990		WOS:000371068600006

However, the unmodified BNNSs are hydrophobic and insoluble in water, which hinders their use in many technological areas requiring aqueous compatibility. In this work, h-BN was treated with molten citric acid to produce aqueous dispersible boron nitride sheets (ca-BNNSs). The resultant ca-BNNSs were used to fabricate ca-BNNS/polyacrylamide (i.e., BNNS2.5/PAAm) nanocomposite hydrogels, targeting high water retentivity and flexibility. The BNNS2.5/PAAm hydrogel (initially swollen in water) largely remained swollen (water content similar to 94 wt%) even after one-year storage under ambient conditions. Importantly, the swollen BNNS2.5/PAAm hydrogel (water content similar to 95 wt%) was highly flexible. Its elongation and compressive strength exceeded 10 000% and 8 MPa at 97% strain, respectively. Moreover, the aforementioned hydrogel recovered upon the removal of compression force, without obvious damage. The substantially improved water retentivity and flexibility revealed that BNNSs can serve as a promising new platform in the development of high-performance hydrogels.									5	0	0	0	0	5			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000370761700048	26838189

A discrete numerical study is proposed for the modeling of penetration tests in constant velocity conditions and also in impact conditions. The model reproduces qualitatively the mechanical response of samples of granular material, compared to classical experimental results. Penetration tests are conducted at constant velocity and from impact, with similar penetration rates ranging from 25 mm s(-1) to 5000 mm s(-1). In constant velocity condition, the value of tip force remains steady as long as the penetration velocity induces a quasi-static regime in the granular material. However, the tip force increases rapidly in the dense flow regime corresponding to higher penetration rate. Impact tip force increases with the impact velocity. Finally, the tip forces obtained from impact penetration tests are smaller compared to the one obtained in constant velocity conditions in both quasi-static and dense flow regimes.

J	McMillen, Colin D.; Kolis, Joseph W.								Hydrothermal synthesis as a route to mineralogically-inspired structures								DALTON TRANSACTIONS				45	7			2772	2784		10.1039/c5dt03424h			2016	2016	The use of high temperature hydrothermal reactions to prepare crystals having mineralogically-related structures is described. Complex naturally occurring minerals can have fascinating structures and exhibit important features like low dimensionality, noncentrosymmetry, or ion channels that can provide excellent guideposts for the designed synthesis of new materials. Actual minerals, even though they may have intriguing physical properties, are often unsuitable for study because of the persistent impurities inevitably present in natural samples. Hydrothermal fluids at relatively high temperatures provide access to large, high quality single crystals of structures with mineral-like structures. This enables the study of physical properties like ionic conduction, magnetic spin frustration and non-linear optical behavior. Some fundamental considerations of the hydrothermal technique are discussed in the context of synthesizing mineralogically-inspired materials. The metal vanadates provide a surprisingly rich and diversified range of compounds and are selected to illustrate many of the concepts described here. A series of low dimensional mineral analogs featuring isolated units, chains, and layers have been prepared in the laboratory as large single crystals using a high temperature hydrothermal synthetic methods, and their physical properties are under investigation. The metal silicates are also highlighted as another promising field of exploration, since their hydrothermal synthesis surprisingly lags behind the enormous literature of the natural silicate minerals. The introduction of heteroelements, such as boron to make borosilicates, appears to also open the door to additional new materials. Many of these new materials have direct equivalents in the mineral kingdom, while others have no known analogs but are reminiscent of minerals and can be classified in the same ways. From these initial results there appears to be a very rich vein of synthetic minerals waiting to be unearthed in the laboratory using the high temperature hydrothermal method.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000370165300002	26781397

I offer an alternative interpretation of the play in which the characters, each vicious and self-interested, constitute an "economy of vice." This interpretation highlights Machiavelli's appreciation for the public (and political) import of ordinary vice and thereby provides when considered in light of medieval influences on Machiavelli's understanding of constitutions new purchase on Machiavelli's political theory. In contrast to the image of Machiavelli as a profoundly political thinker, my argument underscores Machiavelli's role as a precursor to comparatively anti-political modes of thought: in particular, commercial liberalism.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0032-3497	1744-1684		WOS:000370308500006

Many of these networks use canalizing Boolean functions, which has led to increased interest in the study of these functions. The canalizing depth of a function describes how many canalizing variables can be recursively "picked off", until a non-canalizing function remains. In this paper, we show how every Boolean function has a unique algebraic form involving extended monomial layers and a well-defined core polynomial. This generalizes recent work on the algebraic structure of nested canalizing functions, and it yields a stratification of all Boolean functions by their canalizing depth. As a result, we obtain closed formulas for the number of n-variable Boolean functions with depth k, which simultaneously generalizes enumeration formulas for canalizing, and nested canalizing functions.

In thismethod, the steel incident bar consists of a tube section and a solid section of equal impedance mated through a threaded connection. The striker is pneumatically launched within the tube section into an impact cap to create the tensile loading pulse. The transmission bar, which is constructed of aluminum to improve the forcemeasurement sensitivity, is not impedance matched to the incident bar, and as a result the wave analysis technique wasmodified accordingly. The sample geometry follows ISO 26203-1: 2010. Strain-time histories of the specimens obtained by the wave analysis were compared to high speedDIC strain field measurements, and the latterwere used to correct the compliance of the test setup. Material testswere performed parallel to, perpendicular to, and at 45 degrees with respect to the rolling direction. Specimens were taken to failure and to several intermediate strain levels by using momentum traps on the incident and transmission bars. Specimen gauge length, gas pressure and striker bar length were changed to achieve different strain rates, covering the range needed for crash simulations. The dynamic behavior of the material is compared to its quasi-static behavior.

It explores how those firms seek to reduce their risk of entry into this market.Design/methodology/approach - Survey data were gathered over the phone from individuals in the companies who were identified as knowledgeable contacts. Their responses were then analyzed using descriptive statistics and structural equation modeling.Findings - German Mittelstand firms that hire Chinese nationals in China obtain market knowledge and a higher return on investment than others. German managers' efforts to understand the Chinese cultural norms increased the firm's unwillingness to share information with others. This was probably because their concern about protecting their competitive secrets increased, so they shared less information with suppliers, which decreased their return on investment.Research limitations/implications - First, the small sample size limited the analysis. Second, there was low inter-rater reliability on multiple items, so these responses could not be analyzed. There is a need to further validate the survey, and obtain a larger sample to analyze alternative models.Practical implications - This suggests to the practitioner that while it may be relatively easy to start a manufacturing business in China, it requires great effort to manage their risk of losing corporate secrets to their competitors in China.Originality/value - This paper provides a unique set of data from practicing managers about the risks and gains from doing business in China. This data can be of use to both researchers and to practitioners and it provides a foundation to examine how the risk of losing proprietary knowledge to Chinese competitors affects business.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0144-3577	1758-6593		WOS:000369997300002

Reduced Reactivity of Amines against Nucleophilic Substitution via Reversible Reaction with Carbon Dioxide								MOLECULES				21	1						10.3390/molecules21010024			JAN 2016	2016	The reversible reaction of carbon dioxide (CO2) with primary amines to form alkyl-ammonium carbamates is demonstrated in this work to reduce amine reactivity against nucleophilic substitution reactions with benzophenone and phenyl isocyanate. The reversible formation of carbamates has been recently exploited for a number of unique applications including the formation of reversible ionic liquids and surfactants. For these applications, reduced reactivity of the carbamate is imperative, particularly for applications in reactions and separations. In this work, carbamate formation resulted in a 67% reduction in yield for urea synthesis and 55% reduction for imine synthesis. Furthermore, the amine reactivity can be recovered upon reversal of the carbamate reaction, demonstrating reversibility. The strong nucleophilic properties of amines often require protection/de-protection schemes during bi-functional coupling reactions. This typically requires three separate reaction steps to achieve a single transformation, which is the motivation behind Green Chemistry Principle #8: Reduce Derivatives. Based upon the reduced reactivity, there is potential to employ the reversible carbamate reaction as an alternative method for amine protection in the presence of competing reactions. For the context of this work, CO2 is envisioned as a green protecting agent to suppress formation of n-phenyl benzophenoneimine and various n-phenyl-n-alky ureas.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1420-3049			WOS:000369485600034		
J	Cheng, Gang; Perahia, Dvora								Dewetting and microphase separation in symmetric polystyrene-block-polyisoprene diblock copolymer ultrathin films								POLYMER INTERNATIONAL				65	1			39	47		10.1002/pi.5022			JAN 2016	2016	The kinetics of surface structure evolution in ultrathin films of low-molecular-weight polystyrene-block-polyisoprene (M-w: 7300 g mol(-1) - 7300 gmol(-1)) diblock copolymer at temperatures below the bulk order-to-disorder transition temperature are presented. Films with two different thicknesses were studied as a function of annealing temperature using atomic force microscopy. These film thicknesses enabled the investigation of the competition between microphase separation and dewetting that resulted in two different morphologies: long-range bicontinuous structures and random holes. Three distinctive stages of structure evolution were observed in bicontinuous structure, with the underlying mechanism compared with spinodal dewetting. Thicker films presented holes on their surfaces upon annealing at elevated temperatures, and kinetics of formation of the holes were discussed. We found that the molecular mobility determined the rates of dewetting, while the microphase separation hardly affected the dewetting process.

J	Rosopa, Patrick J.; Schroeder, Amber N.; Doll, Jessica L.								Detecting Between-Groups Heteroscedasticity in Moderated Multiple Regression With a Continuous Predictor and a Categorical Moderator: A Monte Carlo Study								SAGE OPEN				6	1					2158244015621115	10.1177/2158244015621115			JAN-MAR 2016	2016	Moderated multiple regression (MMR) is frequently used to test moderation hypotheses in the behavioral and social sciences. In MMR with a categorical moderator, between-groups heteroscedasticity is not uncommon and can inflate Type I error rates or reduce statistical power. Compared with research on remedial procedures that can mitigate the effects of this violated assumption, less research attention has focused on statistical procedures that can be used to detect between-groups heteroscedasticity. In the current article, we briefly review such procedures. Then, using Monte Carlo methods, we compare the performance of various procedures that can be used to detect between-groups heteroscedasticity in MMR with a categorical moderator, including a heuristic method and a variant of a procedure suggested by O'Brien. Of the various procedures, the heuristic method had the greatest statistical power at the expense of inflated Type I error rates. Otherwise, assuming that the normality assumption has not been violated, Bartlett's test generally had the greatest statistical power when direct pairing occurs (i.e., when the group with the largest sample size has the largest error variance). In contrast, O'Brien's procedure tended to have the greatest power when there was indirect pairing (i.e., when the group with the largest sample size has the smallest error variance). We conclude with recommendations for researchers and practitioners in the behavioral and social sciences.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2158-2440			WOS:000369962900001

Computational modeling of oscillating fins that "catch and release" targeted nanoparticles in bilayer flows								SOFT MATTER				12	5			1374	1384		10.1039/c5sm02752g			2016	2016	A number of physiological processes in living organisms involve the selective "catch and release" of biomolecules. Inspired by these biological processes, we use computational modeling to design synthetic systems that can controllably catch, transport, and release specific molecules within the surrounding solution, and, thus, could be harnessed for effective separation processes within microfluidic devices. Our system consists of an array of oscillating, microscopic fins that are anchored onto the floor of a microchannel and immersed in a flowing bilayer fluid. The oscillations drive the fins to repeatedly extend into the upper fluid and then tilt into the lower stream. The fins exhibit a specified wetting interaction with the fluids and specific adhesive interactions with nanoparticles in the solution. With this setup, we determine conditions where the oscillating fins can selectively bind, and thus, "catch" target nanoparticles within the upper fluid stream and then release these particles into the lower stream. We isolate the effects of varying the wetting interaction and the fins' oscillation modes on the effective extraction of target species from the upper stream. Our findings provide fundamental insights into the system's complex dynamics and yield guidelines for fabricating devices for the detection and separation of target molecules from complex fluids.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1744-683X	1744-6848		WOS:000369749500004	26682776

A hierarchical control architecture is proposed in this paper for every HEV, where the higher level and the lower level controller share information with each other and solve two different problems that aim at improving its fuel efficiency. The higher level controller of each HEV is considered to utilize traffic light information, through vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communication, and state information of the vehicles in its near neighborhood, via vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communication. Apart from that, the higher level controller of each HEV uses the recuperation information from the lower level controller and provides it the optimal velocity profile by solving its problem in a model predictive control framework. Each lower level controller uses adaptive equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) for following their velocity profiles, obtained from the higher level controller, in a fuel efficient manner. In this paper, the vehicles are modeled in Autonomie software and the simulation results are provided in the paper that shows the effectiveness of the proposed control architecture.

For absorptive roots, which are mainly responsible for resource acquisition, we hypothesized that root economic strategies differ with increasing root diameter. To test this hypothesis, we used seven plant species (a fern, a conifer, and five angiosperms from south China) for which we separated absorptive roots into two categories: thin roots (thickness of root cortex plus epidermis < 247 mu m) and thick roots. For each category, we analyzed a range of root traits related to resource acquisition and conservation, including root tissue density, different carbon (C), and nitrogen (N) fractions (i.e., extractive, acid-soluble, and acid-insoluble fractions) as well as root anatomical traits. The results showed significant relationships among root traits indicating an acquisition-conservation tradeoff for thin absorptive roots while no such trait relationships were found for thick absorptive roots. Similar results were found when reanalyzing data of a previous study including 96 plant species. The contrasting economic strategies between thin and thick absorptive roots, as revealed here, may provide a new perspective on our understanding of the root economics spectrum.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1726-4170	1726-4189		WOS:000369524500005		
J	Bodenhorn, Howard								Prison crowding, recidivism, and early release in early Rhode Island								EXPLORATIONS IN ECONOMIC HISTORY				59				55	74		10.1016/j.eeh.2015.09.003			JAN 2016	2016	Prison crowding is a pervasive modern problem with deep historical roots. The long-term solution to crowding has been more prisons; the short-term solution is early release. Early release programs can be effective when they balance the savings of reduced prison costs against the costs of recidivism by released convicts. This paper uses historical data to investigate how prison officials altered their early release policies in the face of prison crowding and rising real detention costs. The empirical evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that prison officials make use of information about the risks of recidivism revealed at trial and during incarceration to make informed decisions about whom to release and when.

Quantitative Imaging and In Situ Concentration Measurements of Quantum Dot Nanomaterials in Variably Saturated Porous Media								JOURNAL OF NANOMATERIALS										8237029	10.1155/2016/8237029			2016	2016	Knowledge of the fate and transport of nanoparticles in the subsurface environment is limited, as techniques to monitor and visualize the transport and distribution of nanoparticles in porous media and measure their in situ concentrations are lacking. To address these issues, we have developed a light transmission and fluorescence method to visualize and measure in situ concentrations of quantum dot (QD) nanoparticles in variably saturated environments. Calibration cells filled with sand as porous medium and various known water saturation levels and QD concentrations were prepared. By measuring the intensity of the light transmitted through porous media exposed to fluorescent light and by measuring the hue of the light emitted by the QDs under UV light exposure, we obtained simultaneously in situ measurements of water saturation and QD nanoparticle concentrations with high spatial and temporal resolutions. Water saturation was directly proportional to the light intensity. A linear relationship was observed between hue-intensity ratio values and QD concentrations for constant water saturation levels. The advantages and limitations of the light transmission and fluorescence method as well as its implications for visualizing and measuring in situ concentrations of QDs nanoparticles in the subsurface environment are discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1687-4110	1687-4129		WOS:000369331400001

A novel neomycin dimer benzimidazole conjugate 5 (DPA 83) was synthesized by conjugating a neomycin-dimer with a benzimidazole alkyne using click chemistry to target multiple binding sites on HIV TAR RNA. Ligand 5 significantly enhances the thermal stability of HIV TAR RNA and interacts stoichiometrically with HIV TAR RNA with a low nanomolar affinity. 5 displayed enhanced binding compared to its individual building blocks including the neomycin dimer azide and benzimidazole alkyne. In essence, a high affinity multivalent ligand was designed and synthesized to target HIV TAR RNA.									6	0	0	3	0	6			1477-0520	1477-0539		WOS:000369601600019	26765486

When saturated in liquid water, water/ion clusters were observed only in the PIL block copolymer with longer alkyl side chains (undecyl) as evidenced by both small-angle neutron scattering and intermediate-angle X-ray scattering, i.e., water/ion clusters form within the PIL microdomain under these conditions. The resulting bromide ion conductivity in the undecyl sample was higher than the ethyl sample (14.0 mS cm(-1) versus 6.1 mS cm(-1) at 50 degrees C in liquid water) even though both samples had the same block copolymer morphology (lamellar) and the undecyl sample had a lower ion exchange capacity (0.9 meq g(-1) versus 1.4 meq g(-1)). No water/ion clusters were observed in either sample under high humidity or dry conditions. The resulting ion conductivity in the undecyl sample with lamellar morphology was significantly higher in the liquid water saturated state compared to the high humidity state (14.0 mS cm(-1) versus 4.2 mS cm(-1)), whereas there was no difference in ion conductivity in the ethyl sample when comparing these two states. These results show that small chemical changes to ion-containing block copolymers can induce water/ion clusters within block copolymer microdomains and this can subsequently have a significant effect on ion transport.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1744-683X	1744-6848		WOS:000369747900017	26575014

The parallel similar to 80 mu m x 80 mu m channels pass test solutions down the 30 mm film length via spontaneous wicking action, setting up the possibility for immobilizing different capture agents in the respective channels. The base-film modification process is divided into two steps: ultraviolet light treatment to improve hydrophillicity of the polypropylene substrate and the physical adsorption of a functionalized lipid tethered ligand (LTL) as a selective capture agent. The entire modification procedure is performed under ambient conditions in an aqueous solution without extreme pH conditions. In this demonstration, physical adsorption of a biotinylated-LTL onto the UV-treated PP surface selectively captures Texas Red-labeled streptavidin (SAv-TR) in the presence of enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP), which passes without retention in less than 5 s. In addition to the fluorescence imaging of the protein solutes, matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) was used to confirm the formation of the LTL-SAv conjugates on the channel surface as well as to demonstrate an alternative means of probing the capture step. The present effort sets the groundwork for further development of C-CP films as a parallel, multi-analyte LFA platform; a format that to-date has not been described.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0003-2654	1364-5528		WOS:000368942600005	26646022

The newly delivered Pass. 8 event-level analysis allows the detection and characterization of sources in the 50 GeV-2 TeV energy range. In this energy band, Fermi-LAT. has detected 360 sources, which constitute the second catalog of hard Fermi-LAT. sources (2FHL). The improved angular resolution enables the precise localization of point sources (similar to 1.' 7 radius at 68% C.L.) and the detection and characterization of spatially extended sources. We find that 86% of the sources can be associated with counterparts at other wavelengths, of which the majority (75%) are active galactic nuclei and the rest (11%) are Galactic sources. Only 25% of the 2FHL sources have been previously detected by Cherenkov telescopes, implying that the 2FHL provides a reservoir of candidates to be followed up at very high energies. This work closes the energy gap between the observations performed at GeV energies by Fermi-LAT. on orbit and the observations performed at higher energies by Cherenkov telescopes from the ground.									25	0	0	0	0	25			0067-0049	1538-4365		WOS:000368982300005

Analysis of the polytene chromosomes established that Prosimulium petrosum is most closely related to European populations of Prosimulium latimucro (Enderlein, 1925) with which it shares an identical fixed chromosomal banding sequence. Its validity as a species, separate from Prosimulium latimucro, is based on its unique sex-differential sections in the expanded centromere region of chromosome I, in agreement with the unique structural configuration of the hypostomal teeth of its larvae. Prosimulium petrosum and Prosimulium latimucro, therefore, are homosequential species, demonstrating the value of a combined chromosomal and morphological approach in determining species status.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1993-0771	1993-078X		WOS:000368919300004	27186336

Further, theorists propose that firms led by paradoxical thinkers are more likely to manage these tensions and fuel innovative behavior. Leveraging family business and organizational paradox literatures, this multi-stage exploratory study develops measures of paradoxical tensions and paradoxical thinking in family firms, and tests these propositions. Findings indicate that paradoxical tensions may stymie innovative behavior, but that leaders' paradoxical thinking is positively related to innovative behavior.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1042-2587	1540-6520		WOS:000368943800008

Using building and occupant characteristics to predict residential residual miscellaneous electrical loads: a comparison between an asset label and an occupant-based operational model for homes in Florida								JOURNAL OF BUILDING PERFORMANCE SIMULATION				9	1			84	100		10.1080/19401493.2014.999122			JAN 2016	2016	Over the past thirty years, the intensity of all major energy-use categories has decreased in the residential market with the exception of residual Miscellaneous Electrical Loads (MELs). MELs include primarily plug loads and some hard wired loads. The Home Energy Rating System (HERS) index is the most widely used residential energy rating system in the USA. It provides a home asset label using standardized occupant-dependent behaviour. Standardized occupant behaviour allows for the comparison of other HERS-rated homes, but may not predict actual energy consumption well. This study created the Residual Miscellaneous Electrical Load Model (RMELM) to predict the MEL by regressing an equation from a 12,000 household survey. The RMELM was then tested on 24 existing homes and compared with the MEL model of the HERS index. The RMELM more closely predicted the actual MEL in 71% of the test houses and explained 55% more of the MEL variation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1940-1493	1940-1507		WOS:000368694100006

Undergraduate students (N = 192) completed three Implicit Association Tests (IAT), which were computer-based reaction time tasks where participants responded to terms for mental health and medical treatments that were paired with the attributes good versus bad, effective versus ineffective, and honoring versus humiliating. Survey items assessed explicit ratings of mental health treatment and medical treatment on these attributes, as well as more general attitudes toward mental health treatment. The IAT results revealed a significant negative implicit bias toward mental health treatment as being less effective, good, and honoring than medical treatment. Explicit survey measures also showed more negative responses toward mental health treatment. Some correspondence was also obtained between the implicit biases reflected by the IAT and the explicit biases shown on the self-report survey. Finally, when controlling for mental health symptoms, results showed that students who had sought mental health treatment had more negative explicit attitudes toward mental health treatment than those who had not sought treatment, but no differences were obtained on the implicit attitude measures.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0736-7236			WOS:000368751400003

We describe the species, map their distributions, and provide a key for their identification. Their subcylindrical body form and emarginate mesosternum have previously hindered placement to tribe, although their curent assignment to Exosternini now appears well supported by morphological evidence.

Furthermore, using CO2 as the co-feed offers many environmental advantages. To this end, experimentalists have shown that Rh-substituted lanthanum zirconate pyrochlore (LRhZ) catalysts are active and stable at the high temperatures needed for the dry reforming of methane (DRM). To enable further improvements to these catalysts, the reaction mechanism for DRM on LRhZ catalysts was attained using density functional theory (DFT). Following the identification of favored reaction sites for all elementary reactions, reaction and activation energies were calculated and used to discern the primary reaction pathway. Simulations show that inclusion of Rh decreases activation barriers, including the barriers for the two rate limiting steps (CH2 oxygenation and CHO dehydrogenation), which makes the plane (111) catalytically active for DRM. The slow steps are on the CH4 dehydrogenation/oxygenation path, which agrees with experimental observations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

However, the cytotoxic effects of excessive Mg2+ and the corrosion products from Mg-based biomaterials, particularly their effects on neurons, have been little studied. Although viability tests are most commonly used, a functional evaluation is critically needed. Here, both methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays were used to test the effect of Mg2+ and Mg-extract solution on neuronal viability. Microelectrode arrays (MEAs), which provide long-term, real-time recording of extracellular electro-physiological signals of in vitro neuronal networks, were used to test for toxic effects. The minimum effective concentrations (ECmin) of Mg2+ from the MTT and LDH assays were 3 mmol/L and 100 mmol/L, respectively, while the ECmin obtained from the MEA assay was 0.1 mmol/L. MEA data revealed significant loss of neuronal network activity when the culture was exposed to 25% Mg-extract solution, a concentration that did not affect neuronal viability. For evaluating the biocompatibility of Mg-based biomaterials with neurons, MEA electrophysiological testing is a more precise method than basic cell-viability testing.

Furthermore, the density of the ECM appears to also play a role in the normal mammary tissue and tumour formation. Here we show that the density of the ECM directly influences the number, organization and function of breast acini. Briefly, non-malignant human breast MCF10A cells were incubated in increasing densities of a Matrigel (R)-collagen I matrix. Elastic moduli near and distant to the acinus structures were measured by atomic force microscopy, and the number of acinus structures was determined. Immunochemistry was used to investigate the expression levels of E-cadherin, laminin, matrix metalloproteinase-14 and ss-casein in MCF10A cells. The modulus of the ECM was significantly increased near the acinus structures and the number of acinus structures decreased with the increase in Matrigel-collagen I density. As evaluated by the expression of laminin, the organization of the acinus structures present was altered as the density of the ECM increased. Increases in both E-cadherin and MMP14 expression by MCF10A cells as ECM density increased were also observed. In contrast, MCF10A cells expressed lower ss-casein levels as the ECM density increased. Taken together, these observations highlight the key role of ECM density in modulating the number, organization and function of breast acini.

J	Holguin, Claudia M.; Ma, Xinyuan; Mueller, John D.; Agudelo, Paula								Distribution of Hoplolaimus Species in Soybean Fields in South Carolina and North Carolina								PLANT DISEASE				100	1			149	153		10.1094/PDIS-12-14-1332-RE			JAN 2016	2016	Hoplolaimus columbus is an important nematode pest of soybean in South Carolina and North Carolina. Tolerant cultivars are available for the management of this plant-parasitic nematode; however, variation in the response of soybean cultivars to H. columbus populations has been observed. This variation may be due to the presence of different species or high genetic diversity of H. columbus populations. The objective of this study was to identify the Hoplolaimus spp. present in fields representing the main soybean-growing regions in South Carolina and North Carolina and to examine the genetic variability of these populations. In South Carolina, the only species found associated with soybean was H. columbus but, in North Carolina, H. stephanus was the dominant species. The two species were never found together. Genetic variability analyses of a mitochondrial and a nuclear marker showed that only one haplotype was shared by the H. columbus populations. H. stephanus showed higher genetic variability, with private haplotypes per sampling location. Knowledge of the distribution and genetic variability of these two Hoplolaimus spp. is valuable to growers to determine potentially damaging infestations of these plant-parasitic nematodes in soybean fields.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0191-2917	1943-7692		WOS:000368318200018

Six attributes (green, fruity, peely, fatty, floral and wood) were selected to assess sweet orange essential oils, in which 64 volatile compounds were detected by GC-MS. Monoterpenes constituted the largest chemical group among the volatiles of the essential oils. Thirty-one aroma compounds having more than a 50% detection frequency and large span were selected as major odour active compounds correlated with sensory evaluation assessed by partial least squares regression (PLSR). The correlation result showed alpha-pinene, sabinene, limonene, delta-terpinolene, hexanal, octanal, decanal and dodecanal were typical aroma compounds, which co-varied with a characteristic aroma of the sweet orange essential oil.

Abundance of the young-of-the-year (YOY) fish can vary greatly among years and it may be driven by several key biological processes (i.e. adult spawning, egg survival and fry survival) that span several months. However, the relative influence of seasonal weather patterns on YOY abundance is poorly understood.2. We assessed the importance of seasonal air temperature (a surrogate for stream temperature) and precipitation (a surrogate for stream flow) on brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) YOY summer abundance using a 29-year data set from 115 sites in Shenandoah National Park, Virginia, U.S.A. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model that allowed the effect of seasonal weather covariates to vary among sites and accounted for imperfect detection of individuals.3. Summer YOY abundance was affected by preceding seasonal air temperature and precipitation, and these regional-scale drivers led to spatial synchrony in YOY abundance dynamics across the 170-km-long study area. Mean winter precipitation had the greatest effect on YOY abundance and the relationship was negative. Mean autumn precipitation, and winter and spring temperature had significantly positive effects on YOY abundance, and mean autumn temperature had a significant negative effect. In addition, the effect of summer precipitation differed along a latitudinal gradient, with YOY abundance at more northern sites being more responsive to inter-annual variation in summer precipitation.4. Strong YOY years resulted in high abundance of adults (>age 1 + fish) in the subsequent year at more than half of sites. However, higher adult abundance did not result in higher YOY abundance in the subsequent year at any of the study sites (i.e. no positive stock-recruitment relationship).5. Our results indicate that YOY abundance is a key driver of brook trout population dynamics that is mediated by seasonal weather patterns. A reliable assessment of climate change impacts on brook trout needs to account for how alternations in seasonal weather patterns impact YOY abundance and how such relationships may differ across the range of brook trout distribution.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0046-5070	1365-2427		WOS:000368034300008

Fecal Sterol and Runoff Analysis for Nonpoint Source Tracking								JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY				45	1			315	322		10.2134/jeq2015.06.0312			JAN-FEB 2016	2016	Fecal pollution source identification is needed to quantify risk, target installation of source controls, and assess performance of best management practices in impaired surface waters. Sterol analysis is a chemical method for fecal source tracking that allows for differentiation between several fecal pollution sources. The objectives of this study were to use these chemical tracers for quantifying human fecal inputs in a mixed-land-use watershed without point sources of pollution and to determine the relationship between land use and sterol ratios. Fecal sterol analysis was performed on bed and suspended sediment from impaired streams. Human fecal signatures were found at sites with sewer overflow and septic inputs. Different sterol ratios used to indicate human fecal pollution varied in their sensitivity. Next, geospatial data was used to determine the runoff volumes associated with each land-use category in the watersheds. Fecal sterol ratios were compared between sampling locations and correlations were tested between ratio values and percentage of runoff for a given land-use category. Correlation was not observed between percentage of runoff from developed land and any of the five tested human-indicating sterol ratios in streambed sediments, confirming that human fecal inputs were not evenly distributed across the urban landscape. Several practical considerations for adopting this chemical method for microbial source tracking in small watersheds are discussed. Results indicate that sterol analysis is useful for identifying the location of human fecal nonpoint-source inputs.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0047-2425	1537-2537		WOS:000367948600035	26828187

Work Schedule and Family Differences								JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY				21	1			51	64		10.1037/a0039651			JAN 2016	2016	Prior research has demonstrated the benefits of family-supportive organization perceptions (FSOP) for reducing stress, increasing satisfaction, and increasing worker commitment; however, less research has studied health outcomes or possible differences in the effects of FSOP based on worker characteristics. The present study examined relationships between FSOP and health outcomes, as well as how those relationships may depend on work schedule and family differences. Using a sample of 330 acute care nurses, the findings indicated that FSOP predicted several health and well-being outcomes obtained 9 months later. Further, the relationships between FSOP and the outcome variables depended on some work schedule and family differences. In terms of family differences, FSOP was most strongly related to life satisfaction for those who cared for dependent adults. The relationship between FSOP and health outcomes of depression, musculoskeletal pain, and physical health symptoms were generally significant for workers with dependent children, but not significant for workers with no children. Regarding schedule differences, the relationship between FSOP and life satisfaction was significant for those on nonstandard (evening/night) shifts but not significant for standard day shift workers; however, there were no differences in FSOP relationships by number of hours worked per week. The findings demonstrate that FSOP may benefit some employees more than others. Such differences need to be incorporated into both future work-family theory development and into efforts to document the effectiveness of family-supportive policies, programs, and practices.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1076-8998	1939-1307		WOS:000368119800005	26322440

Two of the main decay properties that a. ect the final abundance distribution the most are half-lives and neutron branching ratios. Using fragmentation of a primary U-238 beam at GSI we were able to measure such properties for several neutron-rich nuclei from Hg-208 to Pb-218. This contribution provides a short update on the status of the data analysis of this experiment, together with a compilation of the latest results published in this mass region, both experimental and theoretical. The impact of the uncertainties connected with the beta-decay rates and with beta-delayed neutron emission is illustrated on the basis of r-process network calculations. In order to obtain a reasonable reproduction of the third r-process peak, it is expected that both half-lives and neutron branching ratios are substantially smaller, than those based on FRDM+QRPA, commonly used in r-process model calculations. Further measurements around N similar to 126 are required for a reliable modelling of the underlying nuclear structure, and for performing more realistic r-process abundance calculations.					6th Nuclear Physics in Astrophysics Conference (NPA)6th Nuclear Physics in Astrophysics Conference (NPA)	MAY 19-24, 2013MAY 19-24, 2013	European Phys Soc, Nucl Phys Div; European Phys Soc; Sociedade Portuguesa Fisica; Sociedade Portuguesa Astronomia; Univ Lisboa, Centro Fisica Nucl; Univ Nova Lisboa, Faculdade Ciencias Tecnologia; Univ Coimbra, Departamento Fisica; Observatorio Astronomico Lisboa; Laboratorio Sistemas Instrumentacao Modelacao Ciencias Tecnologias Ambiente Espaco; ATHENA; JINA; Nucl Astropys Virtual Inst; Fundacao Ciencia Technologia; Helmholtz Int Ctr FAIR; EMMi; Baltic Sci Instruments; ATI Sistemas; HV; TAP PortugalEuropean Phys Soc, Nucl Phys Div; European Phys Soc; Sociedade Portuguesa Fisica; Sociedade Portuguesa Astronomia; Univ Lisboa, Centro Fisica Nucl; Univ Nova Lisboa, Faculdade Ciencias Tecnologia; Univ Coimbra, Departamento Fisica; Observatorio Astronomico Lisboa; Laboratorio Sistemas Instrumentacao Modelacao Ciencias Tecnologias Ambiente Espaco; ATHENA; JINA; Nucl Astropys Virtual Inst; Fundacao Ciencia Technologia; Helmholtz Int Ctr FAIR; EMMi; Baltic Sci Instruments; ATI Sistemas; HV; TAP Portugal	Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Nucl Res, Lisbon, PORTUGALHungarian Acad Sci, Inst Nucl Res, Lisbon, PORTUGAL	1	0	0	0	0	1			1742-6588		*****************	WOS:000368236600045

Less than half (n = 11) had separate procedures devoted to HuNoV outbreak control. Fifteen required disinfection of bodily fluids. Seven had procedures for exclusion of sick staff during an outbreak. Both hand hygiene and bodily fluid cleanup procedures had low mean scores for readability. Mean Flesch Reading Ease and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level for both procedures were in the range of difficult to understand.Conclusion: Most LTC policies and procedures were not consistent with CDC recommendations for HuNoV. Moreover, readability of all procedures is needed so LTC workers can easily understand and implement prevention and control procedures.

Chemical Flux Associated with Spatially and Temporally Variable Submarine Groundwater Discharge, and Chemical Modification in the Subterranean Estuary at Gloucester Point, VA (USA)								ESTUARIES AND COASTS				39	1			1	12		10.1007/s12237-015-9972-0			JAN 2016	2016	Submarine groundwater discharge represents a major but poorly constrained component of coastal marine chemical budgets. In the current study, the geochemical behavior of Ra-224, inorganic nitrogen species, and Fe in shallow coastal groundwater was characterized to improve estimates of chemical flux via submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) at a site in the York River estuary, VA (USA). Directly measured SGD rates varied between 3.9 +/- 1.2 cm day(-1) offshore, and 8.9 +/- 2.6 cm day(-1) close to shore. A clear inverse relationship was observed between SGD and tidal height, reflecting the hydraulic gradient between groundwater and surface water. Discharge rates varied spatially in conjunction with the subterranean estuary location, and there was a strong inverse correlation between seepage rates and seepage salinity. Dissolved Ra-224 activity in the mixing zone reached levels up to 6 dpm L-1 and co-varied with salinity in the groundwater but not in the surface water or seepage water. Instead, a consistent sigmoidal trend of Ra with pH was observed, which matched previous laboratory experiment results. Dissolved NH4 (+) reached concentrations up to 120 mu M in the groundwater and appeared to mix conservatively with respect to salinity in the subterranean estuary. In contrast, NOx (NO2 (-) + NO3 (-)) was low in both fresh groundwater and surface water and showed non-conservative enrichment (up to 23 mu M) within the subterranean estuary. Dissolved Fe also showed non-conservative excess in the subterranean estuary, reaching concentrations up to 50 mu M. SGD-derived chemical fluxes were estimated using several different commonly used approaches: average groundwater concentrations, pore water constituent-salinity trends coupled with directly collected seepage salinity, constituent concentrations in directly collected seepage, and concentrations in shallowest groundwater samples. Different flux estimates were compared with a "variable endmember" approach based on the observed geochemical distribution and inferred behavior.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1559-2723	1559-2731		WOS:000367525900001		
J	She, Dunxian; Mishra, Ashok K.; Xia, Jun; Zhang, Liping; Zhang, Xiang								Wet and dry spell analysis using copulas								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY				36	1			476	491		10.1002/joc.4369			JAN 2016	2016	Climate variability modulates spatio-temporal variability of dry spells (DSs) and wet spells (WSs) within a river basin and will affect water resources management practices leading to various impacts on the socio-economic development in river basins. In this study, we evaluated spatio-temporal variability of DS and WS in Huai River basin (HRB), China, by developing copula-based severity-duration-frequency (SDF) curves. The result shows that the upper reach and the southern part of middle reach of HRB are prone to both DS and WS; however, the duration and severity of WS are comparatively higher in comparison to DS. It was observed that DS is more frequent in spring and summer, whereas WS in summer and autumn. The choice of copula plays an important role in deriving the SDF curves, and an inappropriately chosen copula function may result in a large bias of SDF estimation. The arch12 copula was found to be the best choice in the majority of stations for deriving the SDF curves. The constructed SDF curves primarily shows two major patterns for DS and WS, i.e. concave down pattern and convex up pattern. The frequency of extreme DS decreases from 1960s to 1990s, and increases after 2000s, while the frequency of extreme WS increases from 1970s to 1990s and then decreases from 1990s to 2000s. The results in this study can provide useful information for designing conservation structures and to develop water allocation strategies at different temporal scales.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0899-8418	1097-0088		WOS:000367734800034		
J	Sackett, Corrine R.; Lawson, Gerard								A Phenomenological Inquiry of Clients' Meaningful Experiences in Counseling With Counselors-in-Training								JOURNAL OF COUNSELING AND DEVELOPMENT				94	1			62	71		10.1002/jcad.12062			JAN 2016	2016	This study is a follow-up to Sackett, Lawson, and Burge's (2012) study that explored the meaningful experiences of clients and counselors-in-training (CITs). Using the previous study's themes of clients' experiences in counseling with CITs as a launching pad, the authors examined in greater depth the meaningful experiences of clients who are in counseling with CITs through qualitative phenomenological interviews. Findings, as well as implications for counselor education, supervision, and counseling, are discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0748-9633	1556-6676		WOS:000367721300006

Model comparison and refinement is important to the process of determining accurate doses and dose rates to the whole body and the various organs. Accurate and consistent dosimetry is crucial to the determination of appropriate dose-effett relationships for use in environmental risk assessment. The computational phantoms considered are (1) a geometrically defined model employing anatomically relevant organ size and location, (2) voxel reconstruction of internal anatomy obtained from CT imaging, and (3) a new model utilizing NURBS surfaces to refine the model in (2). Dose Conversion Factors (DCFs) for whole body as well as selected organs of O. mykiss were computed using Monte Carlo modeling and combined with empirical models for predicting activity concentration to estimate dose rates and ultimately determine cumulative radiation dose (mu Gy) to selected organs after several half-lives of Mo-99. The computational models provided similar results, especially for organs that were both the source and target of radiation (less than 30% difference between all models). Values in the empirical model as well as the 14 day cumulative organ doses determined from Mo-99 uptake are compared to similar models developed previously for I-131. Finally, consideration is given to treating the GI tract as a solid organ compared to partitioning it into gut contents and GI wall, which resulted in an order of magnitude difference in estimated dose for most organs.

J	Chen, Qingshan								On staggering techniques and the non-staggered Z-grid scheme								NUMERISCHE MATHEMATIK				132	1			1	21		10.1007/s00211-015-0715-8			JAN 2016	2016	A new staggered-grid momentum-based numerical scheme that is equivalent to the non-staggered Z-grid scheme for linearized shallow water equations is proposed. Utilizing the equivalence between the staggered/non-staggered discrete vorticity-divergence fields and the discrete velocity fields, the equivalent vorticity-divergence formulations of some of the existing staggered-grid schemes, namely the C-grid, D-grid, CD-grid, and co-volume schemes are derived. The strengths and weaknesses of these schemes are discussed from the perspectives of their new formulations.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0029-599X	0945-3245		WOS:000367920100001		
J	Luo, Ye								Gender and Job Satisfaction in Urban China: The Role of Individual, Family, and Job Characteristics								SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH				125	1			289	309		10.1007/s11205-014-0837-x			JAN 2016	2016	This study examines gender differences in job satisfaction in urban Chinese, whether individual achieved status, family and household characteristics, and job characteristics explain these differences, and whether these factors are associated with men's and women's job satisfaction differently using a national representative sample of 1,641 men and 1,375 women from the 2006 Chinese General Social Survey. Urban Chinese women are less satisfied with their jobs than urban Chinese men. This gender difference is largely explained by women's underrepresentation in the Chinese Communist Party and their inferior jobs. Family and household characteristics have stronger impact on women's job satisfaction than on men's, but achieved status and job characteristics have similar associations with job satisfaction for men and women. These findings suggest that persistent gender inequality is detrimental to women's well-being at the workplace.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0303-8300	1573-0921		WOS:000367685400014

For this purpose, adsorption of collagen type I was investigated as a function of the protein concentration (0.01, 0.1, and 0.25mg/mL) and applied potential (open circuit potential [OCP; control], +400, +800, and +1500mV). The resulting substrate surfaces were characterized using spectroscopic ellipsometry, atomic force microscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. Adsorption of collagen type I onto OTCE was affected by the potential applied to the sorbent surface and the concentration of protein. The higher the applied potential and protein concentration, the higher the adsorbed amount (Gamma(collagen)). It was also observed that the application of potential values higher than +800mV resulted in the oxidation of the adsorbed protein. Subsequent adhesion of hMSCs on the OTCEs (precoated with the collagen type I films) under standard cell culture conditions for 2h was affected by the extent of collagen preadsorbed onto the OTCE substrates. Specifically, enhanced hMSCs adhesion was observed when the Gamma(collagen) was the highest. When the collagen type I was oxidized (under applied potential equal to +1500mV), however, hMSCs adhesion was decreased. These results provide the first correlation between the effects of electric potential on protein adsorption and subsequent modulation of anchorage-dependent cell adhesion.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1937-3384	1937-3392		WOS:000367885200008	26549607
