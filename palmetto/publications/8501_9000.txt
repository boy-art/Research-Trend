Prevention of iron- and copper-mediated DNA damage by catecholamine and amino acid neurotransmitters, L-DOPA, and curcumin: metal binding as a general antioxidant mechanism								DALTON TRANSACTIONS				41	21			6458	6467		10.1039/c2dt30060e			2012	2012	Concentrations of labile iron and copper are elevated in patients with neurological disorders, causing interest in metal-neurotransmitter interactions. Catecholamine (dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine) and amino acid (glycine, glutamate, and 4-aminobutyrate) neurotransmitters are antioxidants also known to bind metal ions. To investigate the role of metal binding as an antioxidant mechanism for these neurotransmitters, L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), and curcumin, their abilities to prevent iron-and copper-mediated DNA damage were quantified, cyclic voltammetry was used to determine the relationship between their redox potentials and DNA damage prevention, and UV-vis studies were conducted to determine iron and copper binding as well as iron oxidation rates. In contrast to amino acid neurotransmitters, catecholamine neurotransmitters, L-DOPA, and curcumin prevent significant iron-mediated DNA damage (IC50 values of 3.2 to 18 mu M) and are electrochemically active. However, glycine and glutamate are more effective at preventing copper-mediated DNA damage (IC50 values of 35 and 12.9 mu M, respectively) than L-DOPA, the only catecholamine to prevent this damage (IC50 = 73 mu M). This metal-mediated DNA damage prevention is directly related to the metal-binding behaviour of these compounds. When bound to iron or copper, the catecholamines, amino acids, and curcumin significantly shift iron oxidation potentials and stabilize Fe3+ over Fe2+ and Cu2+ over Cu+, a factor that may prevent metal redox cycling in vivo. These results highlight the disparate antioxidant activities of neurotransmitters, drugs, and supplements and highlight the importance of considering metal binding when identifying antioxidants to treat and prevent neurodegenerative disorders.									14	0	0	11	0	14			1477-9226			WOS:000303775000015	22450660

Some 5-10% of these injuries result in a non-union and need surgical intervention. Currently, the main treatment method for these types of defects is a bone allograft or autograft. The main issues associated with these methods include pain, infection, and donor site morbidity. Bone tissue engineering is a diverse field that focuses on the regeneration of bone by combining cells, scaffolds, growth factors, and dynamic forces. Recently, tissue engineering methods that mimic the natural extracellular matrix (ECM) of bone have been utilized to better serve this need. One such method is the use of electrospinning, which allows for the creation of polymer nanofibers with diameters ranging from a couple microns down to a few nanometers. These nanofibers are very similar in structure and size to those of the natural collagen seen in bone ECM. Further, by combining certain biomimetic techniques along with electrospinning, it is possible to more closely mimic the mechanical properties and morphology of the ECM of bone, as well as enhance cell attachment, alignment, and proliferation. For these reasons, electrospinning is a biomimetic approach that has emerged as a choice candidate for the regeneration of native bone tissue. In this review, we will describe the methods utilized to create biomimetic structures for bone tissue engineering, as well as highlight the advancements made in this field using these methods.									3	2	0	1	0	5			0065-3195		978-3-642-27147-2	WOS:000303541000003

Some of them will produce an amino acid substitution in the corresponding protein sequence (missense mutations); others will not. This paper focuses on genetic mutations resulting in a change in the amino acid sequence of the corresponding protein and how to assess their effects on protein wild-type characteristics. The existing methods and approaches for predicting the effects of mutation on protein stability, structure, and dynamics are outlined and discussed with respect to their underlying principles. Available resources, either as stand-alone applications or webservers, are pointed out as well. It is emphasized that understanding the molecular mechanisms behind these effects due to these missense mutations is of critical importance for detecting disease-causing mutations. The paper provides several examples of the application of 3D structure-based methods to model the effects of protein stability and protein-protein interactions caused by missense mutations as well.									24	0	0	22	0	24			1748-670X			WOS:000303757900001

Evaluating the ergonomics of BCI devices for research and experimentation								ERGONOMICS				55	5			592	598		10.1080/00140139.2012.662527			2012	2012	The use of brain computer interface (BCI) devices in research and applications has exploded in recent years. Applications such as lie detectors that use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to video games controlled using electroencephalography (EEG) are currently in use. These developments, coupled with the emergence of inexpensive commercial BCI headsets, such as the Emotiv EPOC (http://emotiv.com/index.php) and the Neurosky MindWave, have also highlighted the need of performing basic ergonomics research since such devices have usability issues, such as comfort during prolonged use, and reduced performance for individuals with common physical attributes, such as long or coarse hair. This paper examines the feasibility of using consumer BCIs in scientific research. In particular, we compare user comfort, experiment preparation time, signal reliability and ease of use in light of individual differences among subjects for two commercially available hardware devices, the Emotiv EPOC and the Neurosky MindWave. Based on these results, we suggest some basic considerations for selecting a commercial BCI for research and experimentation.Statement of Relevance: Despite increased usage, few studies have examined the usability of commercial BCI hardware. This study assesses usability and experimentation factors of two commercial BCI models, for the purpose of creating basic guidelines for increased usability. Finding that more sensors can be less comfortable and accurate than devices with fewer sensors.									14	0	0	2	0	14			0014-0139			WOS:000303584300008	22506831

Fabrication of the RYDFs via a rod-in-tube method, starting from crystalline YAG, and its transformation to the amorphous state is described. Stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) suppression results from material properties that cooperate to yield a low Brillouin gain coefficient (BGC), namely reduced photoelastic constant and increased acoustic velocity, mass density, and Brillouin spectral width relative to silica. We find typical BGC values for large-mode-area RYDFs to be around 0.5x10(-11) m/W. Utilizing a materials model, these results are extrapolated to compositionally-design further reductions to the BGC, including introducing other co-dopants to the mixture. Finally, we focus on the Yb-doped RYDF (YYDF) and show that it is a good candidate for use in kW-class narrow-linewidth fiber lasers via spectroscopy and amplifier experiments. The RYDFs are found to be very similar to conventional aluminosilicate fibers. We also find that YYDFs offer improved compatibility with phase modulating the laser for further increases in the SBS threshold. Using novel fiber fabrication methods with less-common and low-silica materials can lead to promising glass recipes with ultra-low intrinsic BGCs.

Here we report the application of this technique to in ovo imaging HH18 embryonic chick hearts with an ultrahigh speed of 1,016,000 axial scans per second. The high-scan rate enables the acquisition of high temporal resolution 2D datasets (1,000 frames per second or 1 ms between frames) and 3D datasets (10 volumes per second), without use of prospective or retrospective gating technique. This marks the first time that the embryonic animal heart has been 4D imaged using a megahertz OCT.

Thick photoresist was used in order to obtain the appropriate dynamic range for the desired phase profile. We investigated the effects of both post applied and post exposure baking processes, as well as the effects of surfactant in the developer. We found the resist surface roughness to be a function of both the temperature and the time of the respective bakes, as well as the developer surfactant content.

The devices consist of two crossed linear sub-wavelength grating (SWG) dielectric layers, formed by etching deposited silicon oxide films, separated by a silicon nitride waveguide. The buried SWG duty cycle is lithographically modulated to control the device resonance wavelengths, independent of the top SWG. This is because the buried SWG acts as a tunable effective index layer, controlling the waveguide mode coupling wavelength into the silicon nitride waveguide layer. The two SWG have different spatial periods, to further reduce resonance coupling between them. The fabrication is accomplished using existing photolithographic technology, and conventional PECVD coating techniques.

This GMRF comprised of a single dielectric layer deposited on a transparent substrate. The layer is PECVD grown Silicon Nitrirde with a subwavelength grating (SWG) partially etched through it. The unetched portion of the layer is termed the waveguiding region. When light is incident upon the GMRF at the resonant wavelength, the SWG couples light into a waveguide mode. However, due to the SWG on the waveguide, this mode is leaky and re-couples the light back towards the source. The resonance of the GMRF is a function of the optical properties of the materials used; the thickness of the dielectric layers; and the period and fill-fraction of the SWG. The resonance will change across the device by slowly varying the thickness of the waveguiding layer. Previous work has varied the resonance across the structure by varying the fill fraction of the grating. The methods involved in the previous work made that process usable for only a very narrow range of wavelengths, however this new method will be scalable to a larger wavelength range. The waveguiding layer will be sculpted using Additive Lithography and ICP etching. Afterwards the SWG will be patterned into the Silicon Nitride Layer.

This addition occurred at one end of an existing myofibril, the sides of existing myofibrils, and at the interstice of several separated myofibrils; in the cases of the latter two, we observed mature myofibrils acting as templates. We found that during sarcomeric addition, myosin filaments are assembled onto the premyofibril laterally. This lateral addition, which proceeds stepwise along the axial direction, plays an important role in the accumulation of Z-bodies to form mature Z-disks and in the regulation of sarcomeric length during maturation.

MSP considers the ways that manufacturing organizes its resources in order to create/strengthen manufacturing-related capabilities. In this context, managers often are under pressure to find quick answers in highly complex environments. By viewing MSP as a knowledge creation process, managers may choose a company's objectives based upon previous experiences and knowledge. MSP addresses the level of planning and decision making related to building competitive operations capabilities over the long term.Design/methodology/approach - A survey research was used to make cross-country comparison. The constructs were empirically confirmed in both country samples, attesting to measurement invariance. The proposed model was tested in both samples and analyzed the differences between them.Findings - The results suggest that knowledge is a key resource in MSP in both samples. Resource-based orientation presents higher levels of influence over MSP in Brazil. In the Spanish sample the influence of external knowledge in MSP and market performance is more relevant.Research limitations/implications - One limitation of this study is that the Brazilian sample is located in a specific region and therefore some regional characteristics may be present. Another limitation was the use of a questionnaire in two different countries that was originally developed in a non-native language.Practical implications - As a practical implication, manufacturing should seek to integrate the strategic process in order to be more responsive in dynamic environments.Originality/value - The paper uses a cross-country sample for scale validation, which is rare in management research, Manufacturing strategy process was analyzed from a knowledge-based view, bringing new possibilities for academic studies. For managers, the paper highlights the importance of manufacturing developing a proactive role through knowledge integration in cross-functional activities during the strategic process.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1367-3270			WOS:000302978300007

This microscope works in a fast scanless mode. Subjectively selected sample (or multiple samples located in separated areas) in a large field of view can be imaged by illuminating only the area (or areas) where the target sample (or samples) locate(s). In this way, by precisely designing the multiple foci according to the size and position of the area of interest, we can concentrate all the laser energy and dwell time on that area of the sample, making full use of the available laser power and avoiding photodamage in other areas. Since no scanning is involved, the acquisition time of a multiphoton image is decided only by the sensitivity and readout time of the CCD camera. Moreover, the interfocal distance of the multiple foci matches the lateral resolution of the imaging system, so that the two-photon image was recorded with high lateral resolution. However, crosstalk (spatial interference) on out-of-focus planes occurs between adjacent points when they are too close, degrading the resolution, especially the axial resolution of the imaging system.

To determine how this copper coordination results in the observed antioxidant activity, biologically relevant Cu+ and Cu2+ complexes with the formulae [Cu(dmit)(3)](+) (3), [Cu(dmise)(4)](+) (4a), and [Tpm(iPr)Cu(MISeox)](2+) (6) (dmise = N,N'-dimethylimidazole selone; dmit = N, N'-dimethylimidazole thione; MISeox = bis(1-methylimidazolyl)diselenide; Tpm(iPr) = tris(1,3-diisopropylpyrazolyl)methane) were synthesized, characterized, and their structures determined by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. In addition, kinetic studies using UV-vis spectroscopy indicate that dmise reduces Cu2+ to Cu+ three times faster than dmit. Coordination of dmise and MISeox to copper also results in more negative Cu2+/+ reduction potentials (-373 mV and -503 mV) compared to dmit (-217 mV).

SO is operationally defined as the business' overall propensity for delivering service excellence. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that multi-item measurement scales have sufficient psychometric properties of validity and reliability to be useful for theory building and testing.Design/methodology/approach - The authors followed Menor and Roth's two-phased approach to develop new multi-item measurement scales. First, the authors reviewed the literature, held structured interviews with managers and performed six independent rounds of item-sorting analyses to obtain insights for the initial measurement model specification. Second, survey research procedures were employed to develop and refine a questionnaire to collect data on a sample of senior managers of 181 US businesses that implemented B2B e-services. The psychometric properties of the SO dimensions were confirmed using structural equations modeling.Findings - The authors empirically confirm the nomological network of SO as a third-order latent variable comprised of five combinative service competency bundles: service climate; market focus; process management; human resource policy; and metrics and standards. Together these bundles provide a holistic and integrative representation of the general operating environment's orientation towards customers and a business' general propensity to deliver service excellence. Importantly, the measurement structure of service orientation was found to be invariant for both goods producing and service firms.Practical implications - The proposed metrics are a useful benchmarking tool for practitioners from both manufacturing and service firms to use to monitor and improve their business's SO.Originality/value - The paper is believed to be the first to operationally define and measure SO in the context of B2B e-commerce.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0144-3577	1758-6593		WOS:000302510200007

Life Stress as Mediator of the Childhood Maltreatment - Intimate Partner Violence Link in Low-Income, African American Women								JOURNAL OF FAMILY VIOLENCE				27	1			1	10		10.1007/s10896-011-9398-9			JAN 2012	2012	This study examined the relations between childhood maltreatment, daily life hassles, and intimate partner violence among low-income, suicidal, abused African American women (N=208). Findings indicated a significant association between childhood maltreatment and intimate partner violence, such that women who experienced childhood maltreatment were more likely to experience intimate partner violence as adults than those who reported no childhood maltreatment history. Also, results from bootstrapping analyses revealed that daily life stressors mediated the link between childhood maltreatment and both physical and nonphysical forms of intimate partner violence. These findings highlight the importance of thoroughly assessing for a history of childhood maltreatment, current intimate partner violence, and the nature and extent of daily hassles when working with low-income African American women, as well as helping abused women with a history of childhood maltreatment to cope effectively with the daily life hassles that they encounter.									7	0	0	1	0	7			0885-7482			WOS:000302644700001		
J	Pittman, Jennifer J.; Manard, Benjamin T.; Kowalski, Paul J.; Marcus, R. Kenneth								Capillary-Channeled Polymer (C-CP) Films as Processing Platforms for Protein Analysis by Matrix-Assisted Laser/Desorption Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-MS)								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR MASS SPECTROMETRY				23	1			102	107		10.1007/s13361-011-0269-7			JAN 2012	2012	Polypropylene (PP) capillary-channeled polymer (C-CP) films have parallel, mu m-sized channels that induce solution wicking via capillary action. Efficient mass transport from the solution phase to the channel surface leads to adsorption of hydrophobic protein solutes. The basic premise by which C-CP films can be used as media to manipulate analyte solutions (e.g., proteins in buffer), for the purpose of desalting or chromatographic separation prior to MALDI-MS analysis is presented here. Cytochrome c and myoglobin prepared in a Tris-HCl buffer, and ribonuclease A, lysozyme, and transferrin prepared in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), are used as the test solutions to demonstrate the desalting concept. Protein analysis is performed after deposition on a C-CP film with and without a water washing step, followed by spray deposition of a typical sinapinic acid matrix. Extracted MALDI mass spectra exhibit much improved signal-to-noise characteristics after water washing. A mixture of cytochrome c and myoglobin (2 mu L of 2.5 mu M each in Tris-HCl buffer) was applied, washed with water and spatially separated via simple capillary action (wicking) using a reversed-phase solvent composition of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in 50:50 acetonitrile (ACN):H2O. Subsequent application of sinapinic acid followed by imaging of the film using MALDI-MS reveals that as the protein solution is wicked down the film, separation occurs.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1044-0305			WOS:000302467000011	22012690

Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) measuring 130 nm (length) x 20.4 nm (width) x 6.8 nm (height) were isolated from cotton by sulfuric acid hydrolysis and were incorporated in an alginate fiber wet spinning dope solution. Incorporating CNCs within the alginate fiber enables a nearly two-fold increase in the apparent jet stretch (J(A)), ratio of the linear draw speed to extrusion velocity. Fiber spinning at a constant J(A) resulted in an unexpected decrease in fiber modulus and increase in toughness. Alternatively, fiber spinning at the maximum J(A) resulted in modulus increases that are predicted by the Halpin-Tsai model and the Hui-Shia model. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) was used to elucidate the structure and orientation of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) within the alginate nanocomposite fibers and provide correlations with mechanical property enhancements. The spread of the azimuthal intensity distribution of the CNC (2,0,0) reflection increased with higher CNC loads until the nanoparticles within the matrix spiraled around the longitudinal axis. The appearance of a spiral angle with increasing CNC load resulted in a step reduction in modulus and increase in toughness. Increased fiber stretching during spinning retarded the appearance of the spiral assembly and increased CNC alignment. This spiral orientation is also observed in native cellulose fibers as a microfibril angle and is deterministic of their mechanical properties.									5	0	0	2	0	5			1542-1406			WOS:000302301500023

Wicking of liquids into sagged fabrics								SOFT MATTER				8	17			4725	4730		10.1039/c2sm07080d			2012	2012	The classical Bernoulli problem of a freely hanging fabric sagged between two posts is used for the analysis of wicking phenomena. We show that wicking of a wetting liquid into a Bernoulli catenary is an instructive nontrivial experiment illustrating an unusual coupling between mechanical and capillary forces. When the liquid wicks into the material, it causes the catenary to sway back and forth. We studied theoretically and experimentally the kinetics of wicking into sagged nonwoven materials. The proposed experiment can be used for the analysis of transport and tensile properties of thin porous films.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1744-683X	1744-6848		WOS:000302421400023

The economic value of basin protection to improve the quality and reliability of potable water supply: the case of Loja, Ecuador								WATER POLICY				14	1			1	13		10.2166/wp.2011.007			2012	2012	The objective of this study was to estimate the economic value that people living in Loja, Ecuador, place on the protection of two basins when the protection is designed to improve both the quality and reliability of the water supply for human consumption by urban residents. Empirical results indicate that households have an average willingness to pay (WTP) of $5.80 per month to preserve the basins. The main variables affecting WTP are current monthly water cost, perception about the fairness of the existing water price, the number of hours that service is available, and the gender of the individual interviewed. The results of this study, and the later implementation by the Loja City Municipality of a basin protection project funded through a fee on water users, provide evidence that households at all income levels strongly support and are willing to pay for a project that has the potential to improve the quality of water services and protect the environment.									3	0	0	1	0	3			1366-7017			WOS:000300214300001

Measuring Sustainability: How Traffic Incident Management through Intelligent Transportation Systems has Greater Energy and Environmental Benefits than Common Construction-Phase Strategies for "Green" Roadways								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION				6	5			282	297		10.1080/15568318.2011.597910			2012	2012	The research presented in this paper compares the direct emissions and fuel consumption savings of five different strategies for greener roads. Specifically, savings from an incident management strategy using an Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) application, traffic cameras, is compared to savings from strategies focused on the construction phase including; using regionally provided materials, reducing fossil fuel use, reusing pavement, and using warm-mix asphalt. The comparison used lifecycle assessment to evaluate a 10-mile segment of a key urban interstate in South Carolina. The results revealed that within the first year of operations, implementing the selected ITS strategy would provide a fuel savings that is over 3 times greater than the combined savings that could be realized by implementing all 4 construction-phase strategies together. For an 8-year repaving schedule, the ITS strategy provides fuel savings over 30 times larger than all the construction phase strategies combined, and reduces carbon-dioxide emissions over 5 times more than any one of the construction-phase strategies. The article highlights ITS's effectiveness as a sustainability tool by comparing emissions and fuel use reductions to sustainable construction strategies. These results suggest that policies and rating systems for more sustainable roads should weigh ITS strategies considerably more than individual construction-phase strategies. The results also highlight the need for transportation policy to evaluate the benefits of all potential sustainable strategies to encourage implementation of the most effective ones.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1556-8318			WOS:000302176900002

Scour upstream of a circular orifice under constant head								JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC RESEARCH				50	1			28	34		10.1080/00221686.2011.637821			2012	2012	The transport mechanism as well as the extent and the shape of the scour upstream of a circular orifice is investigated under steady flow conditions for different sediment sizes and heads on the orifice. The main mechanism of sediment transport is found to be vortex-related, appearing randomly within the scour hole. The scour length, maximum scour width, and maximum scour depth are evaluated for various sediment sizes and under different heads on the orifice. The non-dimensional scour depth profiles along the orifice centreline are found to be similar. The non-dimensional scour depth profiles across the width of the scour hole at various locations upstream of the orifice are found to be similar as well. The flow characteristics related to the scaled centreline longitudinal velocity and the scaled position of the maximum longitudinal velocity are found to approach those for the unbounded orifice at the equilibrium scour condition.									6	2	0	0	0	7			0022-1686			WOS:000302151500005

Herein we studied the electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity of Mg2(1+ x)Si0.38Sn0.6Sb0.02 (0.05 <= x <= 0.12) as a function of Mg excess between 300 K and 730 K. The presence of interstitial Mg was corroborated by X-ray powder diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Hall coefficient measurement, and compositional analysis. The electrical properties have been analyzed in the framework of a single parabolic band model to gain more insight on the roles of Mg interstitials. We found that increasing Mg excess content increased the carrier concentration, electronic effective mass, and electrical conductivity, while it decreased the Seebeck coefficient and led to a non-monotonic change in the lattice thermal conductivity. As a result, a maximum ZT similar to 0.85 was attained at 700 K for Mg excess x = 0.1, a similar to 60% enhancement compared to that of the sample x = 0.05. The Mg interstitials thus provide an extra tuning parameter in optimizing the thermoelectric properties of Mg-2(Si,Sn)-based materials.									40	3	0	0	0	41			0959-9428			WOS:000301459500046

Rather than existing on the same temporal plane, as has been the tradition in the leisure literature, we observed that identity was an antecedent of the other involvement facets. Our work provides a theoretical framework ground in microsociological approaches to identity for conceptualizing enduring involvement and other constructs that examine recreationists' lasting ties with leisure (e.g., serious leisure, specialization, commitment) and their settings (e. g., sense of place, place identity).									8	0	0	1	0	8			0149-0400			WOS:000302241400001

This article describes an empirical test with the aim of investigating one of the many thorny issues in audio description: how the soundtrack of audiovisual texts influences perception and comprehension of the scene.Viewers' perception of dynamic media can vary depending on the stimuli introduced, and likely also correlates with the viewer's cognitive intent. This piece presents the results of a test which overlaid various background sounds to a selected clip from the film The Pear Tree Story. Eye movements were recorded with an eye tracker while the clip was being screened. Further comprehension questions were then asked.The approach studied here is the classification of disparate viewing patterns through scanpath comparison, and the possible variance in visual attention that may occur due to the introduction of different auditory stimuli over the same dynamic media.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0907-676X			WOS:000302410300005

We consider broad factors having a social, economic, or cultural nature as covariates in a propensity score model that assesses differences due to immigrant generation. Our results show that, when controlling for such factors as race/ethnicity, socio-economic status, and gender, students' physics identities and the likelihood of choosing a career in physical science are significantly higher amongst first generation students than second generation (or later) students. We conclude that physical science as a career option can be influenced by the experiences of being an immigrant and through the relationship between origin and host culture.

The experimental design involved three sources of aggregates (A, B and C) and three WMA technologies using additives Asphamin (R), Sasobit (R) and Evotherm (R) technology. Test results indicated that 13 mixtures failed to meet the minimum tensile strength ratio requirement of 85%, and all mixtures tested met the minimum wet indirect tensile strength (ITS) value of 448 kPa (65 psi) as per SCDOT specifications. Statistical analysis showed that there was significant difference in the wet ITS values between aggregate A (micaceous granite) and granite (C) for all the mixtures studied. Statistical analysis showed that except for two mixtures, there were no significant differences in the wet ITS values of WMA mixtures amongst four types of mixtures under identical conditions. The mixtures containing over 15% rubber (by weight of virgin binder) produced similar resistance to moisture susceptibility compared with mixtures made with PG 76-22 + fibres.									3	0	0	0	1	3			1029-8436			WOS:000301797500006

In the past decade, there have been many advances in the field of nanotechnology, including the use of silver and other metal nanoparticles. Silver nanoparticles are currently one of the most common metal nanoparticles found in consumer products. Because of the strong bactericidal properties of Ag(1) and Ag nanoparticles, their unpredictable fate of silver in soil water environments has become a serious concern. Regulatory agencies now face difficulties revising/developing proper risk assessment methods to protect agroecosystems and human health. This chapter focuses on historical data of Ag interactions in soil environments, including geochemical occurrence, sorption/desorption processes, and mineral dissolution. Where research is sparse, a review of soft and borderline metal (e.g., Cd(II), Hg(II), TI(I), Cu(II), Zn(II), Pb(II)) soil interactions is included, as analogs to Ag(I) reactivity. In addition, newer data focusing on emerging Ag nanoparticle technology and its activity in soil environments are included.									9	0	0	4	0	9			0065-2113		978-0-12-394275-3	WOS:000301551800002

The research presented in this paper incrementally builds on TAM-based research to gain meaningful insights into the potential differences individuals' exhibit in three types of diffusion outcomes in a post-acceptance context. The authors model and test the effects of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use on intentions to use, intentions to explore, and trying to innovate - IT diffusion outcomes proposed as vital in a post-acceptance context. In addition to TAM predictive variables, the authors investigate how autonomy, a personal control factor, and subjective norms, a social factor, influence individuals' intentions toward and behaviors associated with technology use. The findings suggest cognitive intention outcomes are more likely to be influenced by technology-related factors, while behavioral outcomes are more likely to be influenced by social and personal control factors in post-acceptance contexts. Implications of the study for practice and future research are also discussed.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1546-2234	1546-5012		WOS:000208914200001

The sucrose and corn steep liquor (CSL) were found to be the optimal carbon source and nitrogen source, respectively. CSL and initial pH were selected as the critical factors using Plackett-Burman design. Maximum (6)G-fructofuranosidase 242.57 U/mL with 5.23 mg/L value-added astaxanthin was obtained at CSL 52.5 mL/L and pH 7.89 by central composite design. Neo-FOS yield could reach 238.12 g/L under the optimized medium conditions. Cost analysis suggested 66.3% of substrate cost was reduced compared with that before optimization. These results demonstrated that the optimized medium and culture conditions could significantly enhance the production of (6)G-fructofuranosidase with value-added astaxanthin and remarkably decrease the substrate cost, which opened up possibilities to produce neo-FOS industrially.

Yet the utilization of mixed methods to select sites for these studies is rarely reported. The authors describe their pragmatic mixed methods approach to select a sample for their multisite mixed methods case study of a statewide education policy initiative in the United States. The authors designed a four-stage sequential mixed methods site selection strategy to select eight sites in order to capture the broader context of the research, as well as any contextual nuances that shape policy implementation. The authors anticipate that their experience would provide guidance to other mixed methods researchers seeking to maximize the rigor of their multisite case study sampling designs.									8	0	0	0	0	8			1558-6898	1558-6901		WOS:000301455700004

The outcomes of this new process are (1) the reduction of digestive ripening time by employing ligands (trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) and oleylamine (OA)) as capping agent as well as digestive ripening solvent, (2) ability to tune the photoluminescence (PL) from 410nm to 670 nm, (3) demonstrate the ability of SMAD synthesis technique for other semiconductors (CdTe), (4) direct comparison of CdSe QDs growth with CdTe QDs growth based on digestive ripening times, and (5) enhanced PL quantum yield (QY) of CdSe QDs and CdTe QDs upon covering with a ZnS shell. Further, the merit of this synthesis is the use of bulk CdSe and CdTe as the starting materials, which avoids usage of toxic organometallic compounds, eliminates the hot injection procedure, and size selective precipitation processes. It also allows the possibility of scale up. These QDs were characterized by UV-vis, photoluminescence (PL), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and powder XRD.									4	0	0	1	0	4			1687-4110			WOS:000301458800001

Roof-to-wall metal-connectors are often used to accomplish this goal. Currently, the design and construction community utilizes published metal connector capacities found in manufacturer documentation or other design aids to properly size connectors for a given demand. However, with the ever-increasing trend of using recycled dimensioned lumber and in situ retrofits of older buildings, the limited supply of research in this area is becoming more apparent. At present, the state-of-the-practice does not provide guidance to account for changes in material properties in structurally sound reclaimed or aged lumber. This study uses dimensioned lumber that was extracted from decommissioned buildings, originally built in the 1960s, to examine the effect of reclaimed dimensioned lumber on the design strength of connections by using metal-connectors. Through the use of testing on over 150 samples, this study identifies issues with the current design practice. The metal-connectors show a 20% reduction in uplift design strength, whereas they exhibit a 21% increase in the in-plane design capacity when used in conjunction with the reclaimed lumber. The difference in design capacity for out-of-plane loading appears to be statistically insignificant. As a secondary portion of this study, the design capacities of roof-to-wall connections utilizing two 16d common toenails and a commercially available metal connector were examined. Independent and combined capacities are evaluated. The presence of toenails in roof-to-wall connections is a common situation, as toenails can be used as a construction aid during framing, or toenails can be artifacts left from the original time of construction in retrofit applications. The design capacities of the toenails were determined to be additive to the design capacities of the metal connector for uni-axial loading in uplift or out-of-plane. As a result of rafter splitting, the presence of toenails detracted from the design capacity of the metal connector when loaded uni-axially in-plane. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CF.1943-5509.0000201.

Effect of an In-Clinic IPV Advocate Intervention to Increase Help Seeking, Reduce Violence, and Improve Well-Being								VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN				18	1			118	131		10.1177/1077801212437908			JAN 2012	2012	This quasi-experimental study investigated the efficacy of clinic-based advocacy for intimate partner violence (IPV) to increase help seeking, reduce violence, and improve women's well-being. Eligible and consenting women attending one of six selected clinics in the rural Southern United States were assessed for IPV. Consenting women disclosing IPV were offered either an in-clinic advocate intervention or usual care, depending on the clinic they attended and were followed for up to 24 months. Over follow-up time both IPV scores and depressive symptoms trended toward greater decline among women in the advocate intervention clinics relative to the usual care (business card referral only).									14	0	0	3	0	14			1077-8012			WOS:000301355300008	22411302

An Experimental Study of Mesler Entrainment on a Surfactant-Covered Interface: The Effect of Drop Shape and Weber Number								AICHE JOURNAL				58	1			46	58		10.1002/aic.12573			JAN 2012	2012	Mesler entrainment is the formation of large numbers of small bubbles which occurs when a drop strikes a liquid reservoir at a relatively low velocity. Existing studies of Mesler entrainment have focused almost exclusively on water as the working fluid in a nominally clean state, where even very small levels of contamination can cause significant changes in surface tension that affect the repeatability of the results. Herein water combined with the soluble surfactant Triton X-100 is used as the working fluid in an attempt to stabilize the state of the water surface. Despite this approach, nominally identical drops did not always result in the same bubble formation event. Accordingly, Mesler entrainment was quantified by its frequency of occurrence for drops having the same nominal diameter and impact velocity. This frequency of occurrence was found to be well correlated to both the Weber number and the shape of the drop on impact.

Exfoliated GOs are shown to be mostly single-layer sheets in aqueous solution, and they are also demonstrated for conversion to recover some of the properties intrinsic to graphene. Beyond the commonly used thermal annealing and chemical reduction methods, several environmentally friendly conversion strategies have been explored in the literature. Reported here is a method of annealing GOs in supercritical fluids (SCFs, including carbon dioxide and ethanol) at relatively lower temperatures (up to only 300 degrees C) for their conversion to reduced GOs (rGOs). The characteristic properties of SCFs include low densities (thus low viscosity/high diffusivity) and diminished surface tension, which have found successful applications in extraction and the cleaning of fragile electronic devices, and also found to enable lower-temperature crystallization of amorphous nanomaterials in a fluid-assisted calcination process. In this study the same principles for lower-temperature calcination in SCFs were applied to the conversion of GOs. The rGOs thus obtained were characterized, with their electrical and thermal conductive properties evaluated and correlated with the different processing conditions. The benefits and shortcomings of the SCF processing method are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									14	0	0	2	0	14			0896-8446			WOS:000301015200026

The typical benefits of an OGFC mixture are increased surface permeability, noise reduction, and enhanced surface friction, especially in wet conditions. This paper presents results of a study focusing on the use and properties of OGFC mixtures containing reclaimed polyethylene modified binder (RPEB), crumb rubber modified binder (CRMB), and neat 60/70-grade binder with cellulose fibers. The relative performance of mixtures and an aspect relating to the design of such mixtures, based on the laboratory study, have been presented in detail. Several laboratory tests were carried out in this study to evaluate open-graded friction course mixture properties by adopting two different types of Marshall compaction. A draindown test, a Cantabro stone loss test, a permeability test, an indirect tensile strength test, a resilient modulus test, a rutting test, and a skid resistance test were used to evaluate the performance of OGFC mixtures. The addition of fiber stabilizers and polymerized asphalt significantly reduced the potential for draindown in OGFC mixtures. Mixtures compacted by 50 blows on one face by a Marshall hammer were found to give improved results with respect to abrasion and other related mixture properties of the OGFC mixtures. The test results indicated that polymer modification of the binder enhances the relevant engineering properties of the OGFC mixtures. Tensile strength ratio (TSR) values were found to be less for mixtures with modified binders than the mixtures with unmodified binders and fibers. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000304.

The method involves hydrosilylation of ground UTR particles with trichlorosilane (TCS) under various reaction conditions. The reaction has been carried out with and without solvents and catalysts (Karsted's/Pt catalyst). TCS treated UTR particles are then hydrolyzed to obtain silanol functionalized hydrosilylated rubber powder. Attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared, solid-state C-13 NMR spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis are provided as evidence of hydrosilylation onto rubber particles.

Respiratory sinus arrhythmia as a measure of cognitive workload								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY				83	1			96	101		10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2011.10.011			JAN 2012	2012	The current standard for measuring cognitive workload is the NASA Task-load Index (TLX) questionnaire. Although this measure has a high degree of reliability, diagnosticity, and sensitivity, a reliable physiological measure of cognitive workload could provide a non-invasive, objective measure of workload that could be tracked in real or near real-time without interrupting the task. This study investigated changes in respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) during seven different sub-sections of a proposed selection test for Navy aviation and compared them to changes reported on the NASA-TLX. 201 healthy participants performed the seven tasks of the Navy's Performance Based Measure. RSA was measured during each task and the NASA-TLX was administered after each task. Multi-level modeling revealed that RSA significantly predicted NASA-TLX scores. A moderate within-subject correlation was also found between RSA and NASA TLX scores. The findings support the potential development of RSA as a real-time measure of cognitive workload.

J	Potvin, Geoff; Tai, Robert H.								Examining the Relationships among Doctoral Completion Time, Gender, and Future Salary Prospects for Physical Scientists								JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION				89	1			21	28		10.1021/ed100555j			JAN 2012	2012	Using data from a national survey of Ph.D.-holding chemists and physicists, time-to-doctoral degree is found to be a strong predictor of salary: each additional year in graduate school corresponds to a significantly lower average salary. This is true even while controlling for standard measures of scientific merit (grant funding and publication rates) and several other factors expected to influence salaries (field of research, type of position and rank, type of employing institution, years of seniority, and age). This picture is complicated by the inclusion of gender in the analysis, which reveals that women earn significantly less than men overall and experience no effect of doctoral completion time on their salaries, while men do see a significant gain in salary stemming from earlier completion times. Further investigation indicates that doctoral completion time is largely unconnected to measures of prior academic success, research independence, and scientific merit. This suggests that doctoral completion time is, to a great extent, out of the control of individual graduate students. Nonetheless, it can be influential on an individual's future career prospects, as can gender-related effects.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0021-9584			WOS:000301081500007		
J	Dorais, Michael J.; Atkinson, Miles; Kim, Jon; West, David P.; Kirby, Gregory A.								Where is the Iapetus suture in northern New England? A study of the Ammonoosuc Volcanics, Bronson Hill terrane, New Hampshire								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES				49	1	SI		189	205		10.1139/E10-108			JAN 2012	2012	The similar to 470 Ma Ammonoosuc Volcanics of the Bronson Hill terrane of New Hampshire have back-arc basin basalt compositions. Major and trace element compositions compare favorably to coeval volcanic rocks in the Miramichi Highlands of New Brunswick and the Munsangan and Casco Bay volcanics of Maine, back-arc basin basalts of known peri-Gondwanan origins. Additionally, the Ammonoosuc Volcanics have Nd and Pb isotopic compositions indicative of peri-Gondwanan provenance. Thus, the Ammonoosuc Volcanics correlate with Middle Ordovician, peri-Gondwanan, Tetagouche Exploits back-arc rocks of eastern New England and Maritime Canada. This correlation indicates that the Red Indian Line, the principle Iapetus suture, lies along the western margin of the Bronson Hill terrane. However, the younger (similar to 450 Ma) Oliverian Plutonic Suite rocks that intruded the Ammonoosuc Volcanics, forming domes along the core of the Bronson Hill anticlinorium, have Laurentian isotopic signatures. This suggests that the Ammonoosuc Volcanics were thrust westwardly over the Laurentian margin, and that Laurentian basement rocks are present under the Bronson Hill terrane. A plausible explanation for these relationships is that an easterly dipping subduction zone formed the Ammonoosuc Volcanics in the Tetagoughe Exploits oceanic tract, just east of the coeval Popelogan arc. With the closure of the Iapetus Ocean, this terrane was thrust over the Laurentian margin. Subsequent to obduction of the Ammonoosuc Volcanics, subduction polarity flipped to the west, with the Oliverian arc resulting from a westerly dipping subduction zone that formed under the Taconic Orogeny-modified Laurentian margin.									7	0	0	1	0	7			0008-4077			WOS:000300207500011

The chlorinated compounds include tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethylene, cis-1,2-dichloroethylene, vinyl chloride, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, 1,1-dichloroethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, chloroethane, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, dichloromethane, and chloromethane. The variation in Henry's constants for these compounds as a function of temperature ranged from around 3-fold (chloroethane) to 30-fold (1.2-dichloroethane). Aqueous solubilities of the pure compounds were measured over the temperature range of 8-75 degrees C. The temperature dependence of Henry's constant was predicted using the ratio of pure vapor pressure to aqueous solubility, both of which are functions of temperature. The calculated Henry's constants are in a reasonable agreement with the measured results. With the improved data on Henry's law constants at high temperatures measured in this study, it will be possible to more accurately model subsurface remediation processes that operate near the boiling point of water.

During ozonation-chlorination, two amino acids, glycine and lysine, exhibited distinctly higher HNM formation than the other compounds. The formation of HNMs was higher at pH 8 than 6. Glycine and lysine also produced higher levels of THMs than the other compounds at pH 8. The presence of nitrite resulted in an increase in HNM formation. The presence of bromide increased the HNM formation, especially brominated HNM species. Bromine incorporation factors of trihalogenated HNMs were higher than those of THMs. For chlorination alone, HNM levels were about the detection limit (4 nM or 0.7 mu g L-1) at pH 6 and 8, and in the presence of bromide or nitrite. Amino acids and amino sugars tested, except glycine and lysine, showed relatively low levels of THM (similar to 15 mu g L-1) formation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The formation of CF3NO2 is favored at low pressure and high temperature, where the concentration of the reactive species (NO2)-N-center dot is the greatest, and unfavored at high pressure and low temperature, where the concentration of N2O4 is greatest. The results from varying the stoichiometric ratio of reactants, pressure, temperature, and reaction time in an attempted scale-up of this reaction are consistent with the reaction being equilibrium limited. The best reaction conditions allowed the generation of only 1-3 g of CF3NO2 per batch reaction in an approximate 16-L vessel. As long as reaction conditions are chosen so that all of the starting CF3I is consumed, caustic scrubbing affords a significantly faster, less expensive, and more practical purification method than those previously published.

Predictive Linkages between Recreation Specialization and Place Attachment								JOURNAL OF LEISURE RESEARCH				44	1			70	87					2012	2012	The theory of recreation specialization indicates that as recreationists become more specialized into a recreation activity, they become more dependent on particular resources along a continuum of specialization. Previous empirical studies examining bivariate relationships have not provided a comprehensive understanding of the predictive linkages between recreation specialization and place attachment. This paper employed three sub-dimensions of recreation specialization to investigate the hypothesized connections to place attachment and examined the intermediate effects of experience preferences and consumptive orientation. Results provided empirical evidence that recreation specialization was associated with place attachment and other intervening variables also influenced the effects of recreation specialization on place attachment. Recreation specialization and the other accrued concepts when taken together provided substantial insights to predicting place attachment.									4	0	0	2	0	4			0022-2216			WOS:000300755900004

These materials were tested after short-and long-term aging procedures. The test properties of these mixtures included indirect tensile strength (ITS), the tensile strength ratio (TSR), and the flow value of virgin and aged specimens. The experimental design included two percentages of coal ash (10 and 5% by weight of the aggregate), two roofing shingle contents (5 and 3% by weight of the aggregate), three WMA additives (Asphamin, Sasobit, and Evotherm), two antistripping agents (hydrated lime and one liquid antistripping agent), and two aggregate sources. A total of 72 mixtures were designed and a total of 416 ITS specimens were tested for short-and long-term aged procedures in this study. The test results indicated that the dry and wet ITS values of low-volume mixtures containing moist aggregate generally satisfied the demand of pavement without requiring additional treatment. Mixtures containing hydrated lime, in general, showed a better moisture resistance than liquid ASA for WMA mixtures. Moreover, the addition of WMA additives in the low-volume mixture was effective and generally showed a similar moisture resistance to HMA, except for when using Asphamin and liquid ASA simultaneously. Research results also indicated that the utilization of recycled coal ash and roofing shingles significantly improved moisture resistance of HMA and WMA mixtures.

Any given debris flight situation presents a number of uncertainties such as the size of the piece of debris and the time-varying turbulent wind flow. Current debris flight models are largely deterministic and do not account for such uncertainty in input parameters. The simulations presented model the flight of a single spherical particle whose diameter is given by a probability distribution function, driven by a turbulent wind with velocity fluctuations appropriate to the atmospheric boundary layer. The model predicts the mean and standard deviation of the particle flight distance and impact kinetic energy. Results show that introducing uncertainty in particle diameter, horizontal turbulence intensity, or vertical turbulence intensity leads to larger mean values for flight distance and impact kinetic energy, compared to the condition where there is no variability in input parameters. Introducing input parameter variability also leads to variability in flight distance and impact kinetic energy that is quantified in this study. While the simulations presented do not realistically characterize the complex flow within an urban canopy, the results provide significant physical insight into the influence of particle size variability and turbulence on the mean and standard deviation of the flight distance and impact kinetic energy.

The algorithm was based on temporal profiles of vegetation strength and/or water content, using MODIS surface reflectance in visible to near-IR range. The results obtained from the analysis were compared to national statistics. Estimated SEA regional rice area was 42 x 10(6) ha, which agrees with published values. The model performance was dependent on rice ecosystems. Good linear relationships between the model results and the national statistics were observed for rainfed rice. High linear coefficients of determination, R-2, were also found for irrigated rice and upland rice, but the model tended to underestimate irrigated rice and overestimate upland rice. However, these high R-2 values indicated that the model effectively simulated spatial distribution of these rice areas. These R-2 values were either of similar magnitude or larger than those reported in literature, regardless of the rice ecosystem. Poor correlation was observed for deepwater rice.

Mass analysis was performed with a Thermo Scientific Exactive Mass Spectrometer which utilizes an orbitrap mass analyzer capable of producing mass resolution exceeding m/Delta m > 160,000. The LS-APGD source generates a low-power plasma between the surface of an electrolytic solution flowing at several mu l min(-1) through a fused silica capillary and a counter electrode consisting of a stainless steel capillary employed to deliver the laser ablation particles into the plasma. Sample particles of approximately 100 nm were generated with an Applied Spectra femtosecond laser located remotely and transported through 25 meters of polyurethane tubing by means of argon carrier gas. Samples consisted of an oxygen free copper shard, a disk of solder, and a one-cent U.S. coin. Analyte signal onset was readily detectable relative to the background signal produced by the carrier gas alone. The high mass resolution capability of the orbitrap mass spectrometer was demonstrated on the solder sample with resolution exceeding 90,000 for Pb and 160,000 for Cu. In addition, results from a laser ablation depth-profiling experiment of a one cent coin revealed retention of the relative locations of the similar to 10 mu m copper cladding and zinc rich bulk layers.									12	0	0	7	0	12			0267-9477			WOS:000300316200001

The pi-plasmon resonance present at similar to 4.75 eV (similar to 260 nm) in the optical absorption spectrum of graphene follows the empirical relationship lambda(pi) 250.5 nm + 89.5 nm(2)/L-a, where lambda(pi) represents the pi-plasmon wavelength. Furthermore, our Z-scan studies reveal that the crystallite size significantly changes the saturation intensity in CVD grown graphene. Notably, in comparison to epitaxial graphene layers grown on SiC wafers which exhibit a photogenerated carrier lifetime of few picoseconds, we find that the photogenerated carriers in our CVD grown graphene can exhibit lifetimes as long as nanoseconds.									18	1	0	0	0	19			2040-3364			WOS:000300433700058	22307891

This method is a deterministic model, which expresses liquefaction potential in terms of factor of safety. On many occasions, there is a need to express the liquefaction potential in terms of liquefaction probability. Although several probabilistic models are available in the literature, there is an advantage having a probabilistic version of the Robertson and Wride method so that the engineer who prefers to use this method can obtain additional information of liquefaction probability with minimal extra effort. In this paper, a simple model is developed, which links the factor of safety determined by the Robertson and Wride method to the liquefaction probability. The model, referred to as the probabilistic RW model, is developed, and verified, in a mathematically rigorous manner. Simplified equations for assessing the variation of liquefaction probability caused by the uncertainty in input parameters are also developed. Example applications are presented to demonstrate the developed models.									13	0	0	0	0	13			0008-3674			WOS:000299782300003

This study probed the interactions of the different components of Co/CuZnO catalysts on CO hydrogenation using Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (250 degrees C, H-2/CO = 2) and SSITKA. Only combination of all three metal components produced a catalyst with relatively high C2+ oxygenate selectivity, but with much lower activity compared to that for Co/Al2O3. In situ reaction characterizations, albeit at somewhat different conditions than alcohol synthesis, helped explain interaction of the components. SSITKA, under methanation conditions, indicated that the most striking feature for the combination of Co with ZnO and/or Cu was a much decreased amount of reaction intermediates. Ethane hydrogenolysis results suggested that the different components for these catalysts were in close contact and few or no large ensembles (n >= 12) of Co atoms existed, confirming that ZnO and/or Cu covered/blocked a substantial number of active sites on Co for CO hydrogenation.

J	Tsai, Yu-Tung; Mo, Xunhua; Goodwin, James G., Jr.								The synthesis of hydrocarbons and oxygenates during CO hydrogenation on CoCuZnO catalysts: Analysis at the site level using multiproduct SSITKA								JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				285	1			242	250		10.1016/j.jcat.2011.09.038			JAN 2012	2012	This paper addresses the effect of component interaction in CoCuZnO catalysts on oxygenate synthesis during CO hydrogenation. Formation of the various products was investigated for the first time using in-situ multiproduct SSITKA. CO hydrogenation was carried out in a fixed-bed differential reactor at 250 degrees C and 1.8 atm. Reaction results indicate that the activities for all products decrease with the combination of Co with Cu, possibly, based on SSITKA results, due to partial blockage of the Co surface by Cu. ZnO alone, on the other hand, seems to serve primarily as a support for Co but may increase slightly the intrinsic activities for higher oxygenates. The effects of Cu and ZnO on Co, however, were not additive. The Co-Cu-ZnO combination resulted in a synergy that greatly increased selectivities for higher oxygenates by significantly decreasing the ability for hydrocarbon formation. Interestingly, the rate of synthesis for C-2 oxygenates on Co/CuZnO was identical to that on Co/Al2O3 (considered by most to be only a hydrocarbon synthesis catalyst) but without the high production rate of hydrocarbons.

The photonic pair exhibited energy transfer when excited at the peak absorbance of carbazole and fluoresced with an anthracene spectral response. The fluorescent behavior was confirmed as Forster energy transfer (FRET). The lysate of Pseudomonas resinovorans CA10, a member of a predominant group of soil microorganisms that can metabolize a host of substrates, was employed to degrade the pair and alter the luminance spectral characteristics. The FRET was diminished and the corresponding, individual fluorescence of carbazole and anthracene returned. This general approach may find applications in single-cell metabolic studies and bioactivity assays.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0031-8655			WOS:000298740400017	22044050

To identify the driving simulator scenarios desired by certified driver rehabilitation specialists (CDRSs), we developed a questionnaire consisting of 22 driving scenario situations. A total of 164 CDRSs rated each situation in terms of its importance for inclusion in simulator-based driving. The four situations they identified as most critical were turning left across oncoming traffic, navigating four-way intersections with traffic lights or signs, driving in multiple lanes with traffic on both sides, and reacting to unexpected events that require emergency braking or aggressive maneuvers to prevent an accident. We conducted exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses to group the 22 driving scenario situations. The model with the best fit included 11 situations forming three factors: (1) Intersections, (2) Roadway and Traffic Conditions, and (3) Environmental Conditions. Future studies should include these factors in driving simulator scenarios and evaluate their clinical efficacy in driving evaluation and rehabilitation.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0272-9490			WOS:000299362000014	22389946

Since little is known about the effectiveness of these laws, this research sought to find the benefitcost ratio of advertising quick clearance legislation to improve driver compliance, and compare it with benefitcost ratios of other incident management strategies, particularly traffic cameras, freeway service patrols, and traffic sensors. The analysis used traffic simulation that applied application programming interfaces to produce random spatial and temporal occurrence of incidents, including incident start times, durations, and locations, based on normal distributions developed from field data, to test before and after the law scenarios. The results provide decision makers with support for prioritizing funding between these incident management strategies and indicated that investments in the advertisement of this law was beneficial.

The enzyme was purified to homogeneity by sulfate fractionation and chromatographies on Q-Sepharose, Sephacryl S-200, and S-100 HR columns, and estimated by gel filtration chromatography (GFC) to have a molecular weight (MW) of 131 kDa, of which its subunit was measured by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to be around 65.5 kDa. The enzyme showed active and stable pH ranges both within 4.5 to 5.0. Its optimal temperature was in the range of 45 to 55 degrees C. Freeze drying provided an estimated enzymatic recovery of 95.9%, greater than spray drying with the recovery at 55.6%. The freeze-drying powder could retain its enzymatic activity stably at 4 degrees C for 6 mo. Also, the enzyme in 0.220 U/mL citrus juice could sufficiently remove the naringin for the bitterness. Oral acute toxicity study revealed the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the naringinase powder was >10 g/kg in mice. The contents of arsenic (As), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), the aerobic plate count, and coliform number in the enzyme powder all met the criteria for food use. These characteristics suggest that the naringinase from A. niger is efficient and suitable for debittering the citrus juice, and the process consisting of fermentation, salt precipitation, ion exchange, ultrafiltration, and freeze drying is a promising means to prepare the naringinase for food industry, setting up a strong base to enzymatically debitter citrus juice.									8	6	0	7	0	14			0022-1147	1750-3841		WOS:000299257000012	22122507

This article considers periodic versions of such processes; specifically, the length of an interrenewal is allowed to probabilistically depend on the season at which it began. Using only elementary renewal and Markov chain techniques, computational and limiting aspects of periodic renewal sequences are investigated. We use these results to construct a time series model for a periodically stationary sequence of integer counts.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0269-9648	1469-8951		WOS:000299887000001

Incompatibility is often enhanced by inserting fluorinated segments into one of the blocks and as a result not only the interchain interactions are changed but also the rigidity of the blocks. Herein the incorporation of siloxane into the backbone of a semi-fluorinated block maintains its flexibility and allows separation of the effects of direct interactions due to fluorine atoms from those of rigidity. Measurements were carried out in dilute solutions below 1 wt%, at volume fractions phi(SiF) ranging from 0.0 to 0.5. The high incompatibility of the SiF block drives aggregation at low volume fractions of the SiF block, where spherical core-Gaussian shell aggregates are detected at phi(SiF) = 0.16. In the symmetric SiF-PS complex fluid, elongated micelles were observed. The micelles exhibited unique temperature stability in comparison with the aggregates formed by diblock-copolymers in the lower segregation regime. As the temperature increases the micelles dissociate into free chains to form unimolecular micelles.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1744-683X			WOS:000299477300013

Effect of crop rotations on Rotylenchulus reniformis population structure. Plant Dis. 96:24-29.Rotylenchulus reniformis is a highly variable nematode species and an economically important pest in many cotton fields across the southeastern United States. Rotation with resistant or poor host crops is a method for management of reniform nematode. We studied the effect of six planting schemes covering four 120-day planting cycles on the predominant genotype of R. reniformis. Rotations used were: (i) cotton to corn; (ii) susceptible soybean to corn; (iii) resistant soybean to cotton; (iv) corn to cotton; (v) continuous susceptible soybean; (vi) continuous cotton. After each 120-day cycle, amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) produced from four primer pairs were used to determine the effect of crop rotation on the predominant genotype of reniform nematode. A total of 279 polymorphic bands were scored using four primer combinations. Distinct changes in genotype composition were observed following rotations with resistant soybean or corn. Rotations involving soybean (susceptible and resistant) had the greatest effect on population structure. The characterization of field population variability of reniform nematode and of population responses to host plants used in rotations can help extend the durability of resistant varieties and can help identify effective rotation schemes.									4	0	0	4	0	4			0191-2917	1943-7692		WOS:000298264500003

SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL				76	1			10	17		10.2136/sssaj2010.0413			JAN 2012	2012	This study evaluated whether electrical resistivity monitoring could be used as a tool to detect the activation of macropores in soils. Experiments were performed where soil resistivity was measured using a Wenner array while individual soil macropores were sequentially saturated to simulate changes in macropore activation in a hydrologically active soil. The measured apparent resistivity was found to be highly dependent on the activated macropore porosity. An increase in macropore porosity from 0 to 4% decreased the apparent resistivity of the soil by up to 30%. A simple two-domain model was developed to evaluate the controls on apparent resistivity in a macroporous soil by conceptualizing the macropores as fluid-filled tubes embedded within a homogeneous soil matrix. The model qualitatively reproduced the trends of the observed data and provided reasonable bounds on the expected response of soils, suggesting that it captures first-order influences of macropores on apparent resistivity measurements. The model indicates that the magnitude of the reduction in apparent resistivity is strongly dependent on the contrast in resistivity between the soil (r(o)) and macropores (r(m)), which can be readily estimated in field monitoring scenarios. The r(o)/r(m) ratio is therefore suggested as a useful diagnostic for evaluating conditions where changes recorded in resistivity monitoring data might be used to detect the onset of macropore flow in field-based studies.									4	0	0	1	0	4			0361-5995			WOS:000299220200002

One of its major compounds, fusaric acid, was identified by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS). Because the light intensity of the luminescent bacterium Vibrio qinghaiensis sp. Nov. Q67 can be inhibited by fusaric acid, the fusaric acid content of F. proliferatum was assessed and compared by both the HPLC and luminescent bacterium methods. Although both methods afforded almost similar values of fusaric acid, the latter indicated slightly lower content than the former. Czapek medium was more suitable for the growth of F. proliferatum and fusaric acid production than modified Richard medium, with an optimum pH of approximately 7.0. However, no significant (P < 0.05) correlation was obtained between the fusaric acid production and growth of mycelia of F. proliferatum. The study suggests that the bioevaluation by use of the luminescent bacterium was effective in monitoring fusaric acid production by F. proliferatum without expensive equipment.									6	1	0	5	0	6			1618-2642			WOS:000298645900033	22105299

Employees (n = 174) at a large metropolitan hospital were surveyed at two time periods regarding perceptions of family supportive supervisor behaviors (FSSB), family supportive organizational perceptions (FSOP), bidirectional work-family conflict, bidirectional work-family enrichment, and job attitudes. Supervisors were also asked to provide performance ratings at Time 2. Results revealed FSSB at Time 1 predicted job satisfaction, organizational commitment and intention to leave, as well as supervisor ratings of performance, at Time 2. In addition, both work-family enrichment and family-work enrichment were found to mediate relationships between FSSB and various organizational outcomes, while work-family conflict was not a significant mediator. Results support further testing of supervisor behaviors specific to family support, as well models that include bidirectional work-family enrichment as the mechanism by which work-family resources predict employee and organizational outcomes.									34	3	0	1	1	37			1076-8998			WOS:000299214700003	22149204

Magnets can be brought very close to the planar microchannels for enhanced magnetic field and field gradients, which enables on-chip continuous-flow manipulation of nonmagnetic particles in typical paramagnetic solutions. We performed a systematic study of the transport of polystyrene particles suspended in manganese (II) chloride (MnCl2) solutions through a rectangular microchannel. Owing to their smaller magnetization than the suspending fluid, particles experience negative magnetophoresis and are deflected away from the magnet. The effects of particle position (relative to the magnet), particle size, MnCl2 salt concentration, and fluid flow velocity on the horizontal magnetophoretic deflection are examined using a combined experimental and theoretical approach. The experimental results agree quantitatively with the predictions of an analytical model. The demonstrated nonmagnetic particle deflection may be used with the potential to focus and sort cells in lab-on-a-chip for bio-applications.									32	0	0	6	0	32			1613-4982			WOS:000299084300007

Natural product DNA major groove binders								NATURAL PRODUCT REPORTS				29	2			134	143		10.1039/c1np00054c			2012	2012	Major groove recognition of DNA by proteins utilizes the variation in hydrogen bond donor/acceptor content that makes DNA base-pairs distinguishable from one another. Specific ligand-DNA interactions in the major groove are necessary to develop approaches for inhibition of DNA-protein interactions. As opposed to minor groove binders, little research has been achieved in recognition of the DNA major groove. This review summarizes the progress in identification of natural products that bind to the major groove of DNA. We first review the natural products, pluramycins, aflatoxins, azinomycins, leinamycin, neocarzinostatin, and ditercalinium, that are known to possess major groove interacting elements. These compounds, however, interact primarily with DNA by intercalation between base-pair steps. Some of these compounds utilize non-covalent interactions in order to position themselves to alkylate DNA at the nucleophilic N7 positions on nearby purine bases. Finally, recent reports of non-covalent major groove binding with carbohydrates, aminoglycosides in particular, have revealed them as promising leads for DNA major groove binding probes or drugs.									51	0	0	33	0	51			0265-0568			WOS:000299174300001	22183179

The application of Debye's expansion of the form factor has been extended beyond the second moment of the difference of distances (radius of gyration). Analytical expressions have been derived for the fourth and sixth moments that are valid for all nanoparticle shapes. The moments provide information about the aspect ratio of the nanoparticles regardless of the geometry. If a shape is assumed, simple algebraic expressions for the moments can be obtained for monodisperse and polydisperse samples, which can be used to solve for specific nanoparticle dimensions. The methods described here have been applied to static light scattering measurements of dilute aqueous suspension of triaxial cellulose nanocrystals isolated from cotton. When the polydispersity is included, the dimensions determined from light scattering data (6.4 x 28 x 152 nm) are in close agreement with atomic force microscopy measurements. This methodology can be easily applied to nanoparticles of complex shapes and extended to other scattering techniques; it would be especially useful for polymer based nanoparticles and biological macromolecules.									5	0	0	1	0	5			2046-2069			WOS:000299177000051		
J	Grant, Jason H.; Boys, Kathryn A.								Agricultural Trade and the GATT/WTO: Does Membership Make a Difference?								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS				94	1			1	24		10.1093/ajae/aar087			JAN 2012	2012	Recent empirical studies have estimated the trade flow effect of membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO) and its predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). One important, although largely untested, conclusion from this literature is that the GATT/WTO works well if we ignore trade in agriculture - one of the institutions seemingly apparent failures. This article investigates this conclusion using a large panel of agricultural and non-agricultural trade flows. The results are impressive: the multilateral institution has delivered significant positive effects on members agricultural trade despite its sensitive nature and the reluctance of members to undertake serious reform. These findings are robust to various slices of the data and recent advances in the specification and estimation of the gravity equation to account for sample selection issues and the extensive margin of trade.									10	0	0	0	0	10			0002-9092	1467-8276		WOS:000298889000001

Thus, the detection of water in these products is of substantial relevance. Hence, this study focuses on quantifying trace amounts of water in hydrocarbons using hexane as a model system for industrial oils and petroleum matrices via mid-infrared (MIR) evanescent field absorption spectroscopy. A silver halide fiberoptic waveguide was used to interrogate in situ water-in-hexane emulsions. Either unmodified fibers or waveguides surface-modified with polyacrylic acid layers were used. The limits of detection (LOD) and limits of quantification (LOQ) of water in hexane utilizing tin-crosslinked polyacrylic acid modified fibers were 76 and 170 ppm, respectively. Consequently, the IR absorption signature of water in hexane is detectable at concentrations as low as 10 ppm. The proposed fiberoptic sensing strategy requires a single measurement only, requires no sample preparation, and thus has potential for the direct in situ detection and monitoring of water in industrial oils and petroleum products.									14	0	0	2	0	14			0003-2654			WOS:000297998000008	22132414

Kenneth								Liquid sampling-atmospheric pressure glow discharge (LS-APGD) ionization source for elemental mass spectrometry: preliminary parametric evaluation and figures of merit								ANALYTICAL AND BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				402	1			261	268		10.1007/s00216-011-5359-7			JAN 2012	2012	A new, low-power ionization source for the elemental analysis of aqueous solutions has recently been described. The liquid sampling-atmospheric pressure glow discharge (LS-APGD) source operates at relatively low currents (< 20 mA) and solution flow rates (< 50 mu L min(-1)), yielding a relatively simple alternative for atomic mass spectrometry applications. The LS-APGD has been interfaced to what is otherwise an organic, LC-MS mass analyzer, the Thermo Scientific Exactive Orbitrap without any modifications, other than removing the electrospray ionization source supplied with that instrument. A glow discharge is initiated between the surface of the test solution exiting a glass capillary and a metallic counter electrode mounted at a 90A degrees angle and separated by a distance of similar to 5 mm. As with any plasma-based ionization source, there are key discharge operation and ion sampling parameters that affect the intensity and composition of the derived mass spectra, including signal-to-background ratios. We describe here a preliminary parametric evaluation of the roles of discharge current, solution flow rate, argon sheath gas flow rate, and ion sampling distance as they apply on this mass analyzer system. A cursive evaluation of potential matrix effects due to the presence of easily ionized elements indicate that sodium concentrations of up to 50 mu g mL(-1) generally cause suppressions of less than 50%, dependant upon the analyte species. Based on the results of this series of studies, preliminary limits of detection (LOD) have been established through the generation of calibration functions. While solution-based concentration LOD levels of 0.02-2 mu g mL(-1) are not impressive on the surface, the fact that they are determined via discrete 5 mu L injections leads to mass-based detection limits at picogram to single-nanogram levels. The overhead costs associated with source operation (10 W d.c. power, solution flow rates of < 50 mu L min(-1), and gas flow rates < 10 mL min(-1)) are very attractive. While further optimization in the source design is suggested here, it is believed that the LS-APGD ion source may present a practical alternative to inductively coupled plasma sources typically employed in elemental mass spectrometry.									22	0	0	12	0	22			1618-2642			WOS:000298749300029	21910014

Three anatomies were reconstructed from magnetic resonance images and rapid prototyped with transparent rigid resin. The models presented varying degrees of coarctation (none, moderate, and severe). A Blalock-Taussing (BT) shunt was modeled in all phantoms, which were inserted into a mock circulation. The single ventricle was simulated using a Berlin Heart driven with a PC-controlled piston. Resistive and compliant elements were implemented, creating a lumped parameter network. Pressure was measured at three locations: the transverse aortic arch, just after the aortic isthmus, and further downstream in the thoracic aorta. Volume distribution was derived from the instantaneous flow measurements at three outlets: upper body, lower body, and BT shunt. The combination of three-dimensional (3D) detailed anatomy and lumped parameter network effectively renders the circuit a multiscale in vitro model that successfully reproduces physiologic pressure signals. The pressure results highlight the larger pressure drop caused by coarctation and show the effect of pressure recovery. Results also suggest a reduction of flow to the lower body with increasing severity of coarctation, to the advantage of upper body and pulmonary circulation.

THE r-PROCESS IN METAL-POOR STARS AND BLACK HOLE FORMATION								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS				744	1					L14	10.1088/2041-8205/744/1/L14			JAN 1 2012	2012	Nucleosynthesis of heavy nuclei in metal-poor stars is generally thought to occur via the r-process because the r-process is a primary process that would have operated early in the Galaxy's history. This idea is strongly supported by the fact that the abundance pattern in many metal-poor stars matches well the inferred solar r-process abundance pattern in the mass range between the second and third r-process abundance peaks. Nevertheless, a significant number of metal-poor stars do not share this standard r-process template. In this Letter, we suggest that the nuclides observed in many of these stars are produced by the r-process, but that it is prevented from running to completion in more massive stars by collapse to black holes before the r-process is completed, creating a "truncated r-process," or "tr-process." We find that the observed fraction of tr-process stars is qualitatively what one would expect from the initial mass function and that an apparent sharp truncation observed at around mass 160 could result from a combination of collapses to black holes and the difficulty of observing the higher mass rare-earth elements. We test the tr-process hypothesis with r-process calculations that are terminated before all r-process trajectories have been ejected. We find qualitative agreement between observation and theory when black hole collapse and observational realities are taken into account.									16	1	0	0	0	17			2041-8205			WOS:000298405000014

As part of an effort to better understand isolated wetland ecology in an area undergoing dramatic land use change, we mapped isolated wetlands in South Carolina's Piedmont and Blue Ridge regions using remote sensing and local ecological knowledge (LEK). Remote detection of isolated wetlands was limited by digital resource resolution, topography, and wetland size. LEK was the most useful tool for locating small isolated wetlands. We sampled 10% of the study area using LEK and discovered 44 wetlands with "isolated" characteristics, none of which had been identified by remote sensing. Only 8 of 44 wetlands found through LEK could be identified using remote sensing after their discovery. LEK fills a gap in cryptic ecosystem detection when adequate remotely sensed data are not available. Though effective, using LEK is neither as rapid nor as repeatable as remote sensing. We suggest a two-pronged approach for finding cryptic ecosystems: remote sensing coupled with LEK where data resolution is inadequate. For remote detection of isolated wetlands, we suggest a minimum resolution of 0.33 m for Color Infrared, leaf-off, high-water photography. Despite great advances in remote sensing, data are not uniformly available worldwide and LEK may serve as an effective tool for locating cryptic resources for biodiversity conservation. Mapping cryptic resources will allow for more accurate resource and biodiversity conservation planning under current and future climate scenarios.									10	0	0	8	0	10			0960-3115			WOS:000298190000004

In contrast to the random field modeling (RFM) approach, which necessitates use of Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), the proposed approach employs the equivalent variance technique to consider the effect of spatial variability so that the analysis for probability of basal-heave failure can be performed using well-established first-order reliability method (FORM). Case study shows that this simplified approach yields results that are nearly identical to those obtained from the MCS-based RFM approach. The proposed approach is shown to be effective and efficient for probabilistic analysis of basal-heave in a braced excavation in a 2-D random field. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper reports the practical issues for working with ENMs and suggests nano-specific modifications to protocols. The review considers generic practical issues, as well as specific issues for aquatic tests, marine grazers, soil organisms, and bioaccumulation studies. Current procedures for cleaning glassware are adequate, but electrodes are problematic. The maintenance of exposure concentration is challenging, but can be achieved with some ENMs. The need to characterize the media during experiments is identified, but rapid analytical methods are not available to do this. The use of sonication and natural/synthetic dispersants are discussed. Nano-specific biological endpoints may be developed for a tiered monitoring scheme to diagnose ENM exposure or effect. A case study of the algal growth test highlights many small deviations in current regulatory test protocols that are allowed (shaking, lighting, mixing methods), but these should be standardized for ENMs. Invertebrate (Daphnia) tests should account for mechanical toxicity of ENMs. Fish tests should consider semistatic exposure to minimize wastewater and animal husbandry. The inclusion of a benthic test is recommended for the base set of ecotoxicity tests with ENMs. The sensitivity of soil tests needs to be increased for ENMs and shortened for logistics reasons; improvements include using Caenorhabditis elegans, aquatic media, and metabolism endpoints in the plant growth tests. The existing bioaccumulation tests are conceptually flawed and require considerable modification, or a new test, to work for ENMs. Overall, most methodologies need some amendments, and recommendations are made to assist researchers.

Analysis of ENMs differs from traditional chemical analysis because both chemical and physical forms must be considered. Because ENMs are present as colloidal systems, their physicochemical properties are dependent on their surroundings. Therefore, the simple act of trying to isolate, observe, and quantify ENMs may change their physicochemical properties, making analysis extremely susceptible to artifacts. Many analytical techniques applied in materials science and other chemical/biological/physical disciplines may be applied to ENM analysis as well; however, environmental and biological studies may require that methods be adapted to work at low concentrations in complex matrices. The most pressing research needs are the development of techniques for extraction, cleanup, separation, and sample storage that introduce minimal artifacts to increase the speed, sensitivity, and specificity of analytical techniques, as well as the development of techniques that can differentiate between abundant, naturally occurring particles, and manufactured nanoparticles.

These processes act not only on ENM that might be released directly into the environment, but more importantly also on ENM in consumer products and those that have been released from the product. The environmental fate and transformation are likely to differ significantly for each of these cases. The ENM released from actual direct use or from nanomaterial-containing products are much more relevant for ecotoxicological studies and risk assessment than pristine ENM. Released ENM may have a greater or lesser environmental impact than the starting materials, depending on the transformation reactions and the material. Almost nothing is known about the environmental behavior and the effects of released and transformed ENM, although these are the materials that are actually present in the environment. Further research is needed to determine whether the release and transformation processes result in a similar or more diverse set of ENM and ultimately how this affects environmental behavior. This article addresses these questions, using four hypothetical case studies that cover a wide range of ENM, their direct use or product applications, and their likely fate in the environment. Furthermore, a more definitive classification scheme for ENM should be adopted that reflects their surface condition, which is a result of both industrial and environmental processes acting on the ENM. The authors conclude that it is not possible to assess the risks associated with the use of ENM by investigating only the pristine form of the ENM, without considering alterations and transformation processes.

At low equilibrium concentrations (e.g., 1ppb), MWNTs with larger outer diameters exhibited higher PNT adsorption capacity on an SSA basis than those with smaller diameters. With increasing equilibrium concentration, adsorption on an SSA basis became independent of MWNT diameter, and the total surface area controlled maximum adsorption capacity. A similar analysis for the adsorption of naphthalene, a planar molecule with one less benzene ring but 20 times higher solubility than PNT, showed no correlation with respect to MWNT outer diameter. The results indicated that the surface curvature of MWNT was more important on the adsorption of PNT than on the adsorption of naphthalene. Specific surface area normalized isotherms did not show a correlation between PNT adsorption and lengths of SWNTs and MWNTs. Characterization results indicated that the morphology of CNTs plays an important role on the SSA and pore volume. Data from the manufacturer may not always represent the characteristics of CNTs in a particular batch. Therefore, accurate characterization of CNTs is critical to systematically examine the behavior of CNTs, such as adsorption and transport, in environmental systems. Environ. Toxicol.

The times needed for the adsorption to reach apparent equilibrium on the four carbons followed the order of ACF10>HD4000>SWNT>MWNT. Ultrasonication of the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) accelerated their adsorption kinetics but had no effect on their equilibrium adsorption capacities. The pseudo-second order model (PSOM) provided good fitting for the kinetic data. The fitting of kinetic data with the intraparticle diffusion model indicated that external mass transfer controls the sorption process in the organic compoundCNT systems, whereas intraparticle diffusion dominates in the sorption of organic compounds onto activated carbons.

In particular, zinc oxide (ZnO) is toxic, although it is unclear whether this toxicity is due to the zinc oxide nanoparticles, dissolution to Zn2+, or some combination thereof. The goal of this study was to determine the relative solubilities of both commercially available and in-house synthesized ZnO in matrices used for environmental fate and transport or biological toxicity studies. Dissolution of ZnO was observed in nanopure water (7.187.40mg/L dissolved Zn, as measured by filtration) and Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium (RPMI-1640) (similar to 5mg/L), but much more dissolution was observed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, in which the dissolved Zn concentration exceeded 34mg/L. Moderately hard water exhibited low Zn solubility, likely because of precipitation of a Zn carbonate solid phase. Precipitation of a Zn-containing solid phase in RPMI also appeared to limit Zn solubility. Equilibrium conditions with respect to ZnO solubility were not apparent in these matrices, even after more than 1,000h of dissolution. These results suggest that solution chemistry exerts a strong influence on ZnO dissolution and can result in limits on Zn solubility from precipitation of less soluble solid phases. Environ. Toxicol.

Interactions of gold nanoparticles with freshwater aquatic macrophytes are size and species dependent								ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY				31	1	SI		194	201		10.1002/etc.728			JAN 2012	2012	The partitioning of 4- and 18-nm gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to aquatic macrophytes was investigated in vivo with exposure suspension in well water. Three morphologically distinct aquatic macrophytes were studied. Myriophyllum simulans Orch. and Egeria densa Planch. are submerged aquatic vascular plants, whereas Azolla caroliniana Willd. is a free-floating aquatic fern. Because aquatic plants absorb the majority of their nutrients from the water column, it is logical to hypothesize that they may absorb nanomaterials in suspension, potentially facilitating trophic transfer. Each plant was exposed to two different-sized gold nanospheres at a nominal concentration of 250 mu g/L AuNPs for 24h. Macrophytes were harvested at six time points (1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24h), dried, and then analyzed for gold concentration via inductively coupled plasmamass spectrometry. Concentrations were normalized to whole-plant dry tissue mass. The present study shows that absorption of AuNPs through root uptake was size and species dependent. Electron microscopy revealed that 4- and 18-nm AuNPs adsorbed to the roots of each species. Root tissue was sectioned, and transmission electron microscopy indicated that 4-nm and 18-nm AuNPs were absorbed by A. caroliniana, whereas only 4-nm AuNPs were absorbed by M. simulans. Egeria densa did not absorb AuNPs of either size. Gold nanoparticles were confirmed in tissue by using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Absorption of AuNPs by plants may be a function of the salinity tolerance of each species. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2012;31:194201.

J	Polites, Greta L.; Roberts, Nicholas; Thatcher, Jason								Conceptualizing models using multidimensional constructs: a review and guidelines for their use								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS				21	1	SI		22	48		10.1057/ejis.2011.10			JAN 2012	2012	While information on multidimensional constructs and empirical methods has become more accessible, there remain substantial challenges to theorizing about their form and implications. There are at least two ostensible reasons for such difficulties. First is the issue of terminology; many different terms are currently used to represent the same structural concept, and there is no evidence of standardization taking place around a single set of terms. Second, many studies do not clearly explain the theoretical reasons for choosing the specific multidimensional form of their constructs. To address these deficiencies, we use concepts from the research methods literature, and illustrations from the information systems (IS) literature, to review definitions and issues related to conceptualizing and operationalizing structural models that include multidimensional constructs. Such advice is necessary if we are going to develop and test increasingly sophisticated theoretical models in IS research. We also offer guidelines about how to conceptualize specific forms of multidimensional constructs. By lending greater conceptual clarity to the literature, we believe that this paper provides a foundation for future research incorporating multidimensional constructs in empirical analysis.

J	Hall, David C.; Saygin, Can								Impact of information sharing on supply chain performance								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY				58	1-4			397	409		10.1007/s00170-011-3389-0			JAN 2012	2012	In this study, the effect of information sharing on on-time delivery rate and total cost in a supply chain is investigated via simulation. The experimental factors include capacity tightness, resource reliability, and information sharing modes, which are sharing of resource reliability information, customer demand, and inventory level. The simulation results show that all three experimental factors are statistically significant. Yet, the information sharing modes perform uniquely when the main and interaction effects are analyzed. This study demonstrates that the level of interaction between capacity tightness, resource reliability, and information sharing modes depend on the operational parameters, as well as the flexibility available in a supply chain. Therefore, it may be more feasible to introduce additional flexibility instead of solely focusing on information sharing capability as a coordination tool.									10	0	0	0	0	10			0268-3768	1433-3015		WOS:000298995400033

Effect of temperature and bleaching agent on bleaching of liquid Cheddar whey								JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE				95	1			36	49		10.3168/jds.2011-4557			JAN 2012	2012	The use of whey protein as an ingredient in foods and beverages is increasing, and thus demand for colorless and mild-tasting whey protein is rising. Bleaching is commonly applied to fluid colored cheese whey to decrease color, and different temperatures and bleach concentrations are used. The objectives of this study were to compare the effects of hot and cold bleaching, the point of bleaching (before or after fat separation), and bleaching agent on bleaching efficacy and volatile components of liquid colored and uncolored Cheddar whey. First, Cheddar whey was manufactured, pasteurized, fat-separated, and subjected to one of a number of hot (68 degrees C) or cold (4 degrees C) bleaching applications [hydrogen peroxide (HP) 50 to 500 mg/kg; benzoyl peroxide (BP) 25 to 100 mg/kg] followed by measurement of residual norbixin and color by reflectance. Bleaching agent concentrations were then selected for the second trial. Liquid colored Cheddar whey was manufactured in triplicate and pasteurized. Part of the whey was collected (no separation, NSE) and the rest was subjected to fat separation (FSE). The NSE and FSE wheys were then subdivided and bleaching treatments (BP 50 or 100 mg/kg and HP 250 or 500 mg/kg) at 68 degrees C for 30 min or 4 degrees C for 16 h were applied. Control NSE and FSE with no added bleach were also subjected to each time-temperature combination. Volatile compounds from wheys were evaluated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and norbixin (annatto) was extracted and quantified to compare bleaching efficacy. Proximate analysis, including total solids, protein, and fat contents, was also conducted. Liquid whey subjected to hot bleaching at both concentrations of HP or at 100 mg/kg BP had greater lipid oxidation products (aldehydes) compared with unbleached wheys, 50 mg/kg BP hot-bleached whey, or cold-bleached wheys. No effect was detected between NSE and FSE liquid Cheddar whey on the relative abundance of volatile lipid oxidation products. Wheys bleached with BP had lower norbixin content compared with wheys bleached with HP. Bleaching efficacy of HP was decreased at 4 degrees C compared with 68 degrees C, whereas that of BP was not affected by temperature. These results suggest that fat separation of liquid Cheddar whey has no effect on bleaching efficacy or lipid oxidation and that hot bleaching may result in increased lipid oxidation in fluid whey.									14	0	0	13	0	14			0022-0302			WOS:000298239800005	22192182

Numerical and finite element (FE) studies for a functional design of honeycombs having a high shear strength, (tau(pl)*)(12) and a high shear yield strain, (gamma(pl)*)(12) are conducted with two material selections-mild-steel (MS) and polycarbonate (PC) and five honeycomb configurations, when they are designed to be a target shear modulus, G(12)* of 6.5 MPa. A numerical study of cellular materials theory is used to explore the elastic limit of honeycombs. FE analysis is also employed to validate the numerical study. Cell wall thicknesses are found for each material to reach the target G(12)* for available cell heights with five honeycomb configurations. Both MS and PC honeycombs can be tailored to have the G(12)* of 6.5 MPa with 0.1-0.5 mm and 0.3-2.2 mm cell wall thicknesses, respectively, depending on the number of vertical stacks, N. The PC auxetic honeycomb with theta= -20 deg shows high shear flexibility, when honeycombs are designed to be the G(12)(*) of 6.5 MPa; a 0.72 MPa (tau(pl)*)(12) and a 13% (gamma(pl)*)(12). The authors demonstrate a functional design with cellular materials with a large design space through the control of both material and geometry to generate a shear flexible property.

In this paper we survey the approaches to this central conjecture from domination theory and give some new results along the way. For instance, several new properties of a minimal counterexample to the conjecture are obtained and a lower bound for the domination number is proved for products of claw-free graphs with arbitrary graphs. Open problems, questions and related conjectures are discussed throughout the paper. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

They then used hydrogel delivery of exogenous myostatin in the same injury model to determine the effects of myostatin exposure on muscle and bone healing. Results showed that a "pool" of intense myostatin staining was observed among injured skeletal muscle fibers 12-24 hr postsurgery and that myostatin was also expressed in the soft callus chondrocytes 4 days following osteotomy. Hydrogel delivery of 10 or 100 mu g/ml recombinant myostatin decreased fracture callus cartilage area relative to total callus area in a dose-dependent manner by 41% and 80% (p<0.05), respectively, compared to vehicle treatment. Myostatin treatment also decreased fracture callus total bone volume by 30.6% and 38.8% (p<0.05), with the higher dose of recombinant myostatin yielding the greatest decrease in callus bone volume. Finally, exogenous myostatin treatment caused a significant dose-dependent increase in fibrous tissue formation in skeletal muscle. Together, these findings suggest that early pharmacological inhibition of myostatin is likely to improve the regenerative potential of both muscle and bone following deep penetrant musculoskeletal injury.

Experimental Characterization and Material-Model Development for Microphase-Segregated Polyurea: An Overview								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				21	1			2	16		10.1007/s11665-011-9875-6			JAN 2012	2012	Numerous experimental investigations reported in the open literature over the past decade have clearly demonstrated that the use of polyurea external coatings and/or inner layers can substantially enhance both the blast resistance (the ability to withstand shock loading) and the ballistic performance (the ability to defeat various high-velocity projectiles such as bullets, fragments, shrapnel, etc. without penetration, excessive deflection or spalling) of buildings, vehicles, combat-helmets, etc. It is also well established that the observed high-performance of polyurea is closely related to its highly complex submicron scale phase-segregated microstructure and the associated microscale phenomena and processes (e.g., viscous energy dissipation at the internal phase boundaries). As higher and higher demands are placed on blast/ballistic survivability of the foregoing structures, a need for the use of the appropriate transient nonlinear dynamics computational analyses and the corresponding design-optimization methods has become ever apparent. A critical aspect of the tools used in these analyses and methods is the availability of an appropriate physically based, high-fidelity material model for polyurea. There are presently several public domain and highly diverse material models for polyurea. In the present work, an attempt is made to critically assess these models as well as the experimental methods and results used in the process of their formulation. Since these models are developed for use in the high-rate loading regime, they are employed in the present work, to generate the appropriate shock-Hugoniot relations. These relations are subsequently compared with their experimental counterparts in order to assess the fidelity of these models.									18	0	0	0	0	18			1059-9495			WOS:000298657800002

Laser-patterned stem-cell bridges in a cardiac muscle model for on-chip electrical conductivity analyses								LAB ON A CHIP				12	3			566	573		10.1039/c2lc20699d			2012	2012	Following myocardial infarction there is an irreversible loss of cardiomyocytes that results in the alteration of electrical propagation in the heart. Restoration of functional electrical properties of the damaged heart muscle is essential to recover from the infarction. While there are a few reports that demonstrate that fibroblasts can form junctions that transmit electrical signals, a potential alternative using the injection of stem cells has emerged as a promising cellular therapy; however, stem-cell electrical conductivity within the cardiac muscle fiber is unknown. In this study, an in vitro cardiac muscle model was established on an MEA-based biochip with multiple cardiomyocytes that mimic cardiac tissue structure. Using a laser beam, stem cells were inserted adjacent to each muscle fiber (cell bridge model) and allowed to form cell-cell contact as determined by the formation of gap junctions. The electrical conductivity of stem cells was assessed and compared with the electrical conductivities of cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts. Results showed that stem cell-myocyte contacts exhibited higher and more stable conduction velocities than myocyte-fibroblast contacts, which indicated that stem cells have higher electrical compatibility with native cardiac muscle fibers than cardiac fibroblasts.									17	1	0	10	0	17			1473-0197			WOS:000298964300017	22170399

Alex								Evidence of function for conserved noncoding sequences in Arabidopsis thaliana								NEW PHYTOLOGIST				193	1			241	252		10.1111/j.1469-8137.2011.03916.x			JAN 2012	2012	Whole genome duplication events provide a lineage with a large reservoir of genes that can be molded by evolutionary forces into phenotypes that fit alternative environments. A well-studied whole genome duplication, the a-event, occurred in an ancestor of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Retained segments of the a-event have been defined in recent years in the form of duplicate protein coding sequences (a-pairs) and associated conserved noncoding DNA sequences (CNSs). Our aim was to identify any association between CNSs and a-pair co-functionality at the gene expression level.Here, we tested for correlation between CNS counts and a-pair co-expression and expression intensity across nine expression datasets: aerial tissue, flowers, leaves, roots, rosettes, seedlings, seeds, shoots and whole plants.We provide evidence for a putative regulatory role of the CNSs. The association of CNSs with a-pair co-expression and expression intensity varied by gene function, subgene position and the presence of transcription factor binding motifs. A range of possible CNS regulatory mechanisms, including intron-mediated enhancement, messenger RNA fold stability and transcriptional regulation, are discussed.This study provides a framework to understand how CNS motifs are involved in the maintenance of gene expression after a whole genome duplication event.									10	0	0	10	0	10			0028-646X			WOS:000298300800026	21955124

Determination of embryonic temperature profiles and eggshell water vapor conductance constants in incubating Ross x Ross 708 broiler hatching eggs using temperature transponders								POULTRY SCIENCE				91	1			55	61		10.3382/ps.2011-01759			JAN 1 2012	2012	The comprehensive profiles of the internal and external temperatures of embryonated Ross x Ross 708 broiler hatching eggs during incubation were determined using temperature transponders, and eggshell water vapor conductance (G(H2O)), specific G(H2O) (g(H2O); G(H2O) adjusted to a 100 g set egg weight basis), and G(H2O) constants (K(H2O)) were calculated. On each of 8 replicate tray levels of an incubator, 2 nonembryonated and 4 embryonated eggs were each implanted with a transponder on d 10.5 of incubation for the determination of internal (air cell) temperatures of nonembryonated (T(nem)) and embryonated (T(emb)) eggs, respectively. In addition, 2 water-filled vials, each containing a transponder, were used on each tray level for the determination of the external microenvironment temperatures (T(ext)) of the embryonated and nonembryonated eggs. Between 10.5 and 18 d of incubation, incubator data logger temperatures were determined every 5 min; and incubator dry bulb temperature, T(ext), T(nem), T(emb), and the difference between T(emb) and T(nem) (Delta T) were determined every 12 h. Over the days of incubation, regression coefficients for T(emb) and Delta T were positive, whereas the regression coefficient for T(nem) was negative. There was a significant day of incubation x type of temperature measurement (T(ext), T(nem), and T(emb)) interaction for temperature. Between 13 and 18 d of incubation, mean values of T(emb) readings that were recorded every 12 h were consistently higher than those of T(ext) and T(nem), indicating the importance of air cell transponder implantation for the efficient estimation of broiler embryo temperature. Furthermore, mean values of the percentage of daily incubational egg weight loss, G(H2O), g(H2O), and K(H2O) of the embryonated eggs were 0.54 +/- 0.019%, 14.4 +/- 0.56 mg of H(2)O/d per Torr, 25.0 +/- 0.96 mg of H(2)O/d per Torr per 100 g, and 5.20 +/- 0.205, respectively. The results suggest that transponders may be implanted in the air cells of broiler hatching eggs to detect incubational variations in Temb and to subsequently calculate G(H2O), g(H2O), and K(H2O).									3	0	0	3	0	3			0032-5791			WOS:000298419200006	22184428

Although literature on this subject has grown, little has been written explicitly laying out the doing of research with these communities. The authors seek to articulate their doing by drawing upon the essential research principles and standards set by scholars. The authors seek to examine their work as education researchers in three different international contexts-Kenya, Cambodia, and "Indian country" in the United States-highlighting research practice shaped by context, relationship, and discourse emergent in their investigations of schooling, language revitalization, and scientific knowledge access. The authors reflect, analyze, and summarize their actions of decolonizing research that were present or particularly challenging cross-culturally, in each context. Examples of common action in the projects include relinquishing control, reenvisioning knowledge, cultivating relationships, and purposeful representation of communities. Finally, the authors connect their actions to the principles and standards set by scholars and discuss lessons learned.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1077-8004			WOS:000298184600001

This incident management system integrated incident reporting hotlines, traffic cameras, traffic sensors, and freeway service patrols (FSPs), finding that this approach to incident management outperformed the application of traffic cameras or FSPs alone. The integrated application of intelligent transportation system technologies significantly reduced incident duration and total vehicle hours of travel during an incident. In addition, FSP response policy and headway affected the incident management performance.									5	1	0	0	0	6			0037-5497	1741-3133		WOS:000298745300010		
J	Luo, June								Asymptotic efficiency of ridge estimator in linear and semiparametric linear models								STATISTICS & PROBABILITY LETTERS				82	1			58	62		10.1016/j.spl.2011.08.019			JAN 2012	2012	The linear model with a growing number of predictors arises in many contemporary scientific endeavor. In this article, we consider the commonly used ridge estimator in linear models. We propose analyzing the ridge estimator for a finite sample size n and a growing dimension p. The existence and asymptotic normality of the ridge estimator are established under some regularity conditions when p -> infinity. It also occurs that a strictly linear model is inadequate when some of the relations are believed to be of certain linear form while others are not easily parameterized, and thus a semiparametric partial linear model is considered. For these semiparametric partial linear models with p > n, we develop a procedure to estimate the linear coefficients as if the nonparametric part is not present. The asymptotic efficiency of the proposed estimator for the linear component is studied for p -> infinity. It is shown that the proposed estimator of the linear component asymptotically performs very well. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

There are scenarios, however, where dissolved CO2 may migrate out of the storage reservoir. Under these conditions, CO2 will exsolve from solution during depressurization of the brine, leading to the formation of separate phase CO2. For example, a CO2 sequestration system with a brine-permeable caprock may be favored to allow for pressure relief in the sequestration reservoir. In this case, CO2-rich brine may be transported upwards along a pressure gradient caused by CO2 injection. Here we conduct an experimental study of CO2 exsolution to observe the behavior of exsolved gas under a wide range of depressurization. Exsolution experiments in highly permeable Berea sandstones and low permeability Mount Simon sandstones are presented. Using X-ray CT scanning, the evolution of gas phase CO2 and its spatial distribution is observed. In addition, we measure relative permeability for exsolved CO2 and water in sandstone rocks based on mass balances and continuous observation of the pressure drop across the core from 12.41 to 2.76 MPa. The results show that the minimum CO2 saturation at which the exsolved CO2 phase mobilization occurs is from 11.7 to 15.5%. Exsolved CO2 is distributed uniformly in homogeneous rock samples with no statistical correlation between porosity and CO2 saturation observed. No gravitational redistribution of exsolved CO2 was observed after depressurization, even in the high permeability core. Significant differences exist between the exsolved CO2 and water relative permeabilities, compared to relative permeabilities derived from steady-state drainage relative permeability measurements in the same cores. Specifically, very low CO2 and water relative permeabilities are measured in the exsolution experiments, even when the CO2 saturation is as high as 40%. The large relative permeability reduction in both the water and CO2 phases is hypothesized to result from the presence of disconnected gas bubbles in this two-phase flow system. This feature is also thought to be favorable for storage security after CO2 injection.									37	1	0	6	0	38			0169-3913			WOS:000298296700006

The factors investigated were pH, iodide to dissolved organic carbon (I(-)/DOC) ratio, and NOM characteristics, specifically SUVA(254). A Br(-)/I(-) ratio of 1:2 was also evaluated to detemiine the importance of Br(-) and I(-) concentrations and ratio on I-THM formation and speciation. Regulated triholamethanes (THMs) were measured alongside I-TIMs for a more complete understanding of trihalomethane formation. The results showed that, in general, both I-THM and THM formation increased with decreased pH. Greater formation at lower pH was likely attributed to monochloramine decomposition and the formation of additional oxidants and substituting agents, most notably chlorine. For pH >= 7.5, I-THM yield increased with increasing I(-)/DOC ratio and decreasing specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA(254)) of the water. The Br(-)/I(-), Br(-)/DOC and I(-)/DOC ratios were important factors for I-THM and THM speciation. At pH 6, dichlor-oiodomethane (CHCl(2)I) and bromochloroiodomethane (CHBrClI) were the dominant species at the common bromide and iodide levels. For pH >= 7.5 and for elevated bromide and iodide levels, iodoform (CHI(3)) was always the dominant specie regardless of the Br(-)/I(-) ratio. The results demonstrated that it is important to examine I-THM formation and speciation at typical Br(-)/I(-) ratios (similar to 10) of natural waters, which have often been overlooked in previous investigations, in order to obtain practical and relevant results.

Episodes are triggered by exercise, stress or excitement and characterized by progressive hypertonicity throughout the thoracic and pelvic limbs, resulting in a characteristic 'deer-stalking' position and/or collapse. We used a genome-wide association strategy to map the EFS locus to a 3.48 Mb critical interval on canine chromosome 7. By prioritizing candidate genes on the basis of biological plausibility, we found that a 15.7 kb deletion in BCAN, encoding the brain-specific extracellular matrix proteoglycan brevican, is associated with EFS. This represents a compelling causal mutation for EFS, since brevican has an essential role in the formation of perineuronal nets governing synapse stability and nerve conduction velocity. Mapping of the deletion breakpoint enabled the development of Multiplex PCR and Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) genotyping tests that can accurately distinguish normal, carrier and affected animals. Wider testing of a larger population of CKCS dogs without a history of EFS from the USA revealed that carriers are extremely common (12.9%). The development of molecular genetic tests for the EFS microdeletion will allow the implementation of directed breeding programs aimed at minimizing the number of animals with EFS and enable confirmatory diagnosis and pharmacotherapy of affected dogs.

J	Batt, Gregory; Gibert, James; Daqaq, Mohammed	Anonymous							Nonlinear Vibration Response of Expanded Polymer Foam Cushion Material								18TH IAPRI WORLD PACKAGING CONFERENCE								48	56					2012	2012	The protection of shock and vibration sensitive products from such inputs in the distribution environment is often handled through the use of various cushion such as polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene. Textbooks on protective packaging design and packaging dynamics suggest linearized models to predict shock and vibration response, however these materials are highly nonlinear in particular regions of their deflection. These materials are also viscoelastic in nature meaning their behaviour at any instant in time is dependent on their load history. The gap between available models and actual material behaviour is addressed by many cushion designers through the use of cushion curves to predict shock response or compare the shock mitigating performance of different materials. Industry accepted test standards such as ASTM D1596 and ASTM D4168 are used in creating these curves, however significant laboratory time is required to collect the necessary data. Few tools exist for predicting the vibration response of a given mass-loaded cushion material and there are currently no industry accepted standards for creating these tools. This paper provides an overview of some techniques used in determining the frequency response of mass-loaded cushion materials and illustrates their limitations in capturing the nonlinear vibration response. Numerical data from a nonlinear, viscoelastic model of a mass-loaded cushion material is used to demonstrate the frequency response to a sinusoidal base excitation. The model is based on a single degree of freedom dynamic system exposed to linear unidirectional motion. This model includes polynomial type strain-based stiffness, and the viscoelastic component is represented with a hereditary model using a convolution integral formulation. A numerical parameter study of the complete model is conducted to illustrate the effect of different model parameters on frequency response. Finally, an experimental technique is discussed that enables capturing the nonlinear frequency response of a cushion material. Some laboratory data will be illustrated to demonstrate the nonlinear frequency response predicted by the numerical simulation.					18th IAPRI World Conference on Packaging18th IAPRI World Conference on Packaging	JUN 17-21, 2012JUN 17-21, 2012	Int Assoc Packaging Res Inst; Lansmont; Innovated Packaging Co Inc; Packaging World; West; PTIS; Tobii; GREIF; Bay Cities; BEMIS; Anheuser Busch; Mitsubishi Electr; Ista; Corrugated Packaging Alliance; Morning Star; Fox Packaging; Packaging Fores Associates Inc; Mocon; Dow; Westpak Inc; Epson; Multisorb Technologies; Landsberg; AmcorInt Assoc Packaging Res Inst; Lansmont; Innovated Packaging Co Inc; Packaging World; West; PTIS; Tobii; GREIF; Bay Cities; BEMIS; Anheuser Busch; Mitsubishi Electr; Ista; Corrugated Packaging Alliance; Morning Star; Fox Packaging; Packaging Fores Associates Inc; Mocon; Dow; Westpak Inc; Epson; Multisorb Technologies; Landsberg; Amcor	Calif Polytechn State Univ, Orfalea Coll Business, Packaging Program, San Luis Obispo, CACalif Polytechn State Univ, Orfalea Coll Business, Packaging Program, San Luis Obispo, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-60595-084-6	WOS:000351916500008

We have studied the impact of void-filling process on the peak position and peak linewith. In particular, the relative height of the higher-energy A(g) mode decreases gradually upon void-filling, which has been attributed to the "rattling" effects of the filling atoms in Sb icosahedrons. It is found that the double-filling process has produced more pronounced "rattling" effects than the single-filling process, accounting for more effective scattering of phonons and lower lattice thermal conductivity.

ASEE					EMPHASIZING CORE CALCULUS CONCEPTS USING BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS TO ENGAGE, MENTOR, AND RETAIN STEM STUDENTS								2012 ASEE ANNUAL CONFERENCE		ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition												2012	2012	With an increasing demand for biomedical and bioengineering professionals in the coming decades, educators are tasked with readying a greater number of STEM students who are able to apply mathematical concepts to critical health care decisions. In this work, we have developed a series of for-credit, applied learning modules that are being given in parallel to the freshman and sophomore calculus curriculum. These modules use creative inquiry and applied learning experiences to connect mathematical concepts with bioengineering and medical applications. We hypothesize that exposure and participation in the applied learning experiences outside of standard mathematics classes, will improve the students' performance and perceived appreciation for their math curriculum.The four module series is offered over a 2 year period to groups of up to 25 students, and emphasize mathematics and statistics relevant to four biomedical research areas 1) orthopaedics, 2) infectious diseases, 3) heat propagation in the human body, and 4) mammography and radiology. In class activities are complimented with biomedical facility field trips, greater access to professors and tutors outside of class, and audio-video tutorials. In this paper, the methods and results of module one are presented (orthopaedics, recently completed in the Fall 2011 semester with 3 students participating). Assessment of project outcomes consists of a formative and summative evaluation. When complete, pre and post surveys, follow-up surveys, and exit interviews will be used to assess the student's satisfaction with the modules, usefulness of the field-trips, and to gage student understanding of uses of mathematics in STEM fields. In addition, student's performance in current and future math courses and retention in STEM majors are being monitored from participation in modules until graduation.This scalable project utilizes a diverse set of faculty from the math and bioengineering departments. The project value to STEM goals are found in, 1) convincing students through applied learning experiences that mathematics is an important component of any research plan and indispensable to their career success, and (2) ensuring that these students do not falter in calculus and abandon their STEM goals. Outreach modules for K-12 are also being developed as part of student participation. This paper presents our developed methods and initial findings with the hopes of inspiring other institutions to adopt similar applied learning experiences for their STEM students.

ASEE					IMPROVEMENTS IN COMPUTATIONAL METHODS COURSES IN CHEMICAL ENGINEERING								2012 ASEE ANNUAL CONFERENCE		ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition												2012	2012	As more core courses in the undergraduate curriculum require significant ability using computer skills, we see a need for improved methods of instruction in computer methods courses required in the chemical engineering curriculum. It is important to provide students with a series of approaches and activities that ensure (1) that students are applying algorithmic thinking and not just learning how to operate in a single computing environment, (2) that students are able to develop their abilities to formulate problems in a computational context, and (3) that students are applying numerical algorithms in meaningful ways and not just following a template. To that end, we discuss here overviews of our computational methods courses and implementation that encourages behavior independent of choice of computer software.We also share here our plans to evaluate student abilities and perceptions in courses following computer methods to assess the effectiveness of the courses. We share results here from preliminary self-assessment surveys plus plans for implementation for the Spring 2012 semester.

In 1998, the call for action from CEEC'95 ultimately resulted in adoption of ASCE Policy Statement 465-Academic Prerequisites for Licensure and Professional Practice. ASCE PS 465 states that, in the future, education beyond the baccalaureate degree will be necessary for entry into the professional practice of civil engineering. In 2002, an ASCE Board-level committee, the Committee on Academic Prerequisites for Professional Practice (CAP<^>3), was formed to study and implement the actions that would be necessary to achieve this vision for civil engineering. The last ten years have produced significant progress in in what has been called ASCE'S" Raise the Bar" initiative.This paper provides a review of the recommendations for formal education resulting from the "raise the bar" initiative that impact the undergraduate curriculum, and the effectiveness of the efforts to implement the recommendations based on a survey of civil engineering curricula to determine changes made in the undergraduate curriculum as a result of the recommendations. The curricular changes driven by the "raise the bar" initiative in three specific BSCE programs are reviewed.This is one of several papers presented in recognition of the tenth anniversary of establishing CAP<^>3. The collective papers will provide engineering educators and practitioners with a description of the history, lessons learned, and next steps related to the "raise the bar" initiative. Collectively these present the six different aspects of the "Raise the Bar" initiative: (1) The overall initiative, (2) The civil engineering body of knowledge, (3) changed university curricula, (4) draft guidelines for professional experience, (5) revised accreditation criteria, and (6) modified licensure laws and rules.

S	Grigg, Sarah Jane; Benson, Lisa			ASEE					EFFECTS OF STUDENT STRATEGIES ON SUCCESSFUL PROBLEM SOLVING								2012 ASEE ANNUAL CONFERENCE		ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition												2012	2012	In order to analyze students' problem- solving strategies, tablet PCs were used to capture student problem solving attempts for 3 separate problems (n=76) completed by students in an introductory engineering course. Specific goals of this project include: (1) elucidate how first year engineering students utilize problem solving strategies, and (2) evaluate successful and unsuccessful problem solving strategies, as well as errors and misconceptions, in terms of cognitive and metacognitive processes. Data collected from 36 students in Spring 2011 has been analyzed using a validated coding structure. The analysis identifies relevant events within well-structured word problems which had multiple possible ways of solving the problem but only one correct answer. To assess mental workload students experience as they solve problems, a task load index (NASA-TLX) was administered after students completed each problem. The NASA-TLX is a survey with six subscales: three measuring demand put on the participant by the task and three measuring stress added by the participant as a result of interacting with the task.Statistical analysis of solution data for the three problems (related to efficiency of a multi-stage solar power system, formulating an equivalent circuit, and solving for the total pressure in a system) produced interesting results related to planning and visualization tasks such as organizing information at the beginning of the problem and drawing a visual representation of the system. Statistical comparisons revealed that students who conducted a complete planning phase were more likely to obtain correct solutions (p=0.05) and students who drew diagrams with labels that illustrated the relationship of variables were associated with lower overall mental workload (p=0.036), lower mental demand (p=0.018), and lower frustration (p=0.011). This information can be used to inform researchers on different strategies that novice problem solvers use to manage the problem solving process and the effectiveness of those strategies. The ultimate goal of this project is to better design and present problems in introductory engineering courses to capitalize on strategies that lead to successful building of problem- solving skills.

ASEE					GRADUATE STUDENTS: INFLUENTIAL AGENTS OF SOCIAL CAPITAL FOR ENGINEERING UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCHERS								2012 ASEE ANNUAL CONFERENCE		ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition												2012	2012	The STEM education community's research on undergraduate research experiences has shown that participation in a research experience has a positive influence on undergraduates. This study focuses on determining the role of graduate student mentors in the undergraduate researchers' development of availability, access, and activation of social capital resources related to research and academic/career plans. Using Lin's Network Theory of Social Capital, we surveyed and interviewed fourteen students taking part in a summer research program on a research intensive university campus. Results from the study indicate that graduate students served as unique and significant agents of social capital associated with plans to pursue academic/career plans related to research, specifically to attend graduate school.

Students come into these programs at various levels of academic preparation, and students may experience cognitive overload when asked to simultaneously use mathematical skills and higher-order thinking skills. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of new approaches to introducing complex, relevant contexts and skills, methods must be developed that can provide evidence of metacognition and critical thinking skills. These methods can also facilitate research into problem-solving strategies. The overall goal of this project is to design problems for first year students that introduce complex real world topics that are effective for building problem-solving skills for students at all levels of academic preparation. The study presented here is the preliminary qualitative analysis of students' audio commentary in which they reflect on their written problem solutions in a first year engineering course. These reflections were performed within 24 hours of completing written work. Our analysis provides evidence of metacognition retrospectively, as well as during the post-hoc think-aloud commentary. This research methodology effectively identifies student problem-solving strategies, including cognitive, metacognitive and procedural information, and provides evidence that think-aloud protocols are useful in eliciting metacognition and critical thinking.

IEEE					How does Academic Preparation Influence How Engineering Students Solve Problems?								2012 FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE (FIE)		Frontiers in Education Conference												2012	2012	In first year engineering courses, students possess a wide range of academic preparation such as their exposure to various mathematics courses and pre-engineering programs. Additionally, students bring perceptions about their abilities, and have already begun practicing preferred methods of analysis and documentation. Understanding how students with different backgrounds develop problem solving skills in first year engineering programs is of critical importance in order to close achievement gaps between diverse populations.This study examines how students solve engineering problems and identifies variations based on student factors of gender, ethnicity, mathematics preparation and achievement, and prior engineering experience. Solutions for three problems from 27 students were analyzed (n = 68 solutions). Students worked out problems using custom-designed software that digitally records ink strokes and allows researchers to associate codes to the problem solution at any point, even in portions of the problem solution that would not have been available without the use of this technology, such as in erased workDifferences in how students solve problems were assessed based on the prevalence (or absence) of elements and errors in the problem solving process, which were evaluated using task analysis. Results indicated that pre-engineering experience did not have a significant impact on successfully solving problems; however, having completed a calculus course was significantly related to successful problem solving. Future research will expand the study population to a larger sample of first year engineering students across multiple semesters, identifying key strategies that are absent for students with low mathematics preparation, and to investigate relationships between prior academic preparation and indicators of metacognition.

The changes that take place in a random copolymer Biphenyl Perfluorocyclobutane (BPh-PFCB) impregnated with Polyhedral Oligomeric Silsesquioxane (POSS) nanoparticles (NPs) exposed to humidity were followed by neutron reflectometery. The response to water is affected by the dispersion of the NPs which is strongly influenced by the semifluorinated nature of the polymer. Thin films of the pristine polymer consist of layered structures with the air interface rich with the fluorinated block. Pristine BPh-PFCB polymer films were surprisingly fully wetted by water, with distinct accumulation of liquid at the air/polymer and substrate/polymer interface. Upon exposure of the nanocomposite thin films to water vapor, compositional changes took place at the interfaces, which demonstrate the ability of the hybrid film to respond. The response mechanism encompasses the effect of fluorination that controls the interactions of the NPs within the polymer, coupled with entropic driving forces.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0097-6156		978-0-8412-2792-7	WOS:000336003100007

J	Ingram-Smith, Cheryl; Thurman, Jerry L Jr; Zimowski, Karen; Smith, Kerry S								Role of motif III in catalysis by acetyl-CoA synthetase.								Archaea (Vancouver, B.C.)				2012				509579	509579		10.1155/2012/509579			2012	2012	The acyl-adenylate-forming enzyme superfamily, consisting of acyl- and aryl-CoA synthetases, the adenylation domain of the nonribosomal peptide synthetases, and luciferase, has three signature motifs (I-III) and ten conserved core motifs (A1-A10), some of which overlap the signature motifs. The consensus sequence for signature motif III (core motif A7) in acetyl-CoA synthetase is Y-X-S/T/A-G-D, with an invariant fifth position, highly conserved first and fourth positions, and variable second and third positions. Kinetic studies of enzyme variants revealed that an alteration at any position resulted in a strong decrease in the catalytic rate, although the most deleterious effects were observed when the first or fifth positions were changed. Structural modeling suggests that the highly conserved Tyr in the first position plays a key role in active site architecture through interaction with a highly conserved active-site Gln, and the invariant Asp in the fifth position plays a critical role in ATP binding and catalysis through interaction with the 2'- and 3'-OH groups of the ribose moiety. Interactions between these Asp and ATP are observed in all structures available for members of the superfamily, consistent with a critical role in substrate binding and catalysis for this invariant residue.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1472-3654		MEDLINE:22973162	22973162

Nanoparticle drug delivery systems offer the ability to design a delivery vehicle that maximizes the therapeutic index of a drug encapsulated into nanoparticles (NPs), target it to cancerous tissue, and release it in a controlled manner for optimal dosing. This chapter describes the barriers associated with various delivery routes, specifically tissue, cellular, and molecular. Nanoparticle delivery approaches across tissue barriers such as pulmonary, nasal, oral, and transdermal are discussed along with systemic biodistribution and interactions of nanoparticles with their biological environment. A discussion of design considerations to optimize the delivery system is included to provide a guide for the engineering of a delivery system for specific applications.									2	0	0	2	0	2					978-1-4398-0405-6; 978-1-4398-0404-9	WOS:000355542900005

Computational and mathematical methods in medicine				2012				805827	805827		10.1155/2012/805827			2012	2012	Single-point mutation in genome, for example, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or rare genetic mutation, is the change of a single nucleotide for another in the genome sequence. Some of them will produce an amino acid substitution in the corresponding protein sequence (missense mutations); others will not. This paper focuses on genetic mutations resulting in a change in the amino acid sequence of the corresponding protein and how to assess their effects on protein wild-type characteristics. The existing methods and approaches for predicting the effects of mutation on protein stability, structure, and dynamics are outlined and discussed with respect to their underlying principles. Available resources, either as stand-alone applications or webservers, are pointed out as well. It is emphasized that understanding the molecular mechanisms behind these effects due to these missense mutations is of critical importance for detecting disease-causing mutations. The paper provides several examples of the application of 3D structure-based methods to model the effects of protein stability and protein-protein interactions caused by missense mutations as well.									0	0	0	0	1	1				1748-6718		MEDLINE:22577471	22577471

Annual Conference				2012				3959	62		10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346833			2012	2012	New wavelet-derived features and strategies that can improve autonomous EEG classifier performance are presented. Various feature sets based on the morphological structure of wavelet subband coefficients are derived and evaluated. The performance of these new feature sets is superior to Guler's classic features in both sensitivity and specificity. In addition, the use of (scalp electrode) spatial information is also shown to improve EEG classification. Finally, a new strategy based upon concurrent use of several mother wavelets is shown to result in increased sensitivity and specificity. Various attempts at reducing feature vector dimension are shown. A non-parametric method, k-NNR, is implemented for classification and 10-fold cross-validation is used for assessment.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1557-170X			MEDLINE:23366794	23366794

We were interested in identifying watermelon cultivars having high stability for fruit yield and yield components over diverse environments in the US. A set of 40 genotypes was tested over 3 years (2009, 2010, and 2011) at 8 locations across the southern US in replicated, multi-harvest trials. Yield traits were summed over harvests, and measured as marketable yield, fruit count, % cull fruit, % early fruit, and fruit size. The influences of years and locations on yield performance and genotypes with high stability for yield were identified. Four genotypes including, 'Fiesta F1', 'Stars-N-Stripes F1', 'Stone Mountain' and 'Calhoun Gray' had a high trait mean performance and high phenotypic stability. These four stable genotypes had high marketable yield, average fruit count, low % cull fruit, above average early yield, and medium fruit size. Inbreds 'Big Crimson' and 'Legacy' would be good lines for breeding for high yield and stability.					10th EUCARPIA Meeting on Genetics and Breeding of Cucurbitaceae10th EUCARPIA Meeting on Genetics and Breeding of Cucurbitaceae	OCT 15-18, 2012OCT 15-18, 2012	European Assoc Res Plant Breeding; Cukurova Univ; Minis Food, Agr & Livestock; Turkish Sci & Technol Council; Antalya Tarim; Manier Seed; Yuksel Seed; Syngenta; AG Seed; Fito Seed; Multi Seed; Nunhems; Rijk Zwaan; Bati Akdeniz Agr Res Inst; Alata Hort Res StatEuropean Assoc Res Plant Breeding; Cukurova Univ; Minis Food, Agr & Livestock; Turkish Sci & Technol Council; Antalya Tarim; Manier Seed; Yuksel Seed; Syngenta; AG Seed; Fito Seed; Multi Seed; Nunhems; Rijk Zwaan; Bati Akdeniz Agr Res Inst; Alata Hort Res Stat	Antalya, TURKEYAntalya, TURKEY	1	0	0	0	0	1					978-605-63297-0-8	WOS:000345687100010

Rootstock lines RKVL 301, RKVL 316, and RKVL 318 (RKVL = Root Knot Vegetable Laboratory) were compared to wild commercial cucurbit rootstocks and tinda (Praecitrullus fistulosus) for grafted seedless triploid watermelon (C. lanatus subsp. vulgaris var. vulgaris) 'Tri-X 313' in fields infested with southern RKN (Meloidogyne incognita) in Charleston, SC. RKVL wild watermelon rootstocks had lower (P<0.05) root galling (range: 9% to 16%) than non-grafted 'Tri-X 313' (41%), 'Emphasis' (86%), 'Strong Tosa' (99%), and wild tinda (96%) rootstocks. The RKVL 318 rootstock produced higher fruit yield (29.5 kg/plot of 6 plants) (P<0.05) than all other rootstocks (mean = 11.0 kg/plot), except for self-grafted 'Tri-X 313' watermelon (21.5 kg/plot). The three RKVL wild watermelon lines should be useful rootstocks for grafted watermelon, and useful germplasm sources for developing RKN-resistant watermelon breeding lines and cultivars. In greenhouse tests, we evaluated reaction of 23 commercial cucurbit rootstocks and germplasm accessions including African horned cucumber (Cucumis metuliferus), pumpkiny(Cucurbita moschata), hybrid squash (C. maxima x C. moschata), and melon. Melon, pumpkin, and squash exhibited the most severe root galling (range: 4.2-5.0 using a 1 to 5 rating scale where 1=no galls and 5=more than 80% of root system galled) in the greenhouse test. African horned cucumber was moderately resistant to susceptible (galling range 2.6-3.2). Several accessions of different cucurbit species were evaluated as rootstocks for grafted 'Athena' melon in a field infested with RKN (M. incognita) in Charleston, SC. All Cucurbita spp. and C. melo entries were highly susceptible to M. incognita in the field tests as evidenced by high numbers of M. incognita eggs in roots (up to 3600 eggs/gram fresh root). African horned cucumber rootstocks supported the lowest RKN reproduction. All rootstocks were compatible with the scion 'Athena' melon. Additional studies are underway for developing African horned cucumber rootstocks that could be useful for managing RKN in grafted melon.					10th EUCARPIA Meeting on Genetics and Breeding of Cucurbitaceae10th EUCARPIA Meeting on Genetics and Breeding of Cucurbitaceae	OCT 15-18, 2012OCT 15-18, 2012	European Assoc Res Plant Breeding; Cukurova Univ; Minis Food, Agr & Livestock; Turkish Sci & Technol Council; Antalya Tarim; Manier Seed; Yuksel Seed; Syngenta; AG Seed; Fito Seed; Multi Seed; Nunhems; Rijk Zwaan; Bati Akdeniz Agr Res Inst; Alata Hort Res StatEuropean Assoc Res Plant Breeding; Cukurova Univ; Minis Food, Agr & Livestock; Turkish Sci & Technol Council; Antalya Tarim; Manier Seed; Yuksel Seed; Syngenta; AG Seed; Fito Seed; Multi Seed; Nunhems; Rijk Zwaan; Bati Akdeniz Agr Res Inst; Alata Hort Res Stat	Antalya, TURKEYAntalya, TURKEY	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-605-63297-0-8	WOS:000345687100024

The objectives of our study were to study mega-environments, and identify test locations that were both discriminating among genotypes and representative of target regions for watermelon (Citrullus lanatus [Thumb.] Matsum & Nakai) fruit yield and yield components using GGE (genotype plus genotype x environment) biplot methodologies. Experiments were conducted in replicated, multiple-harvest trials for three years at eight locations. Two key locations, Quincy FL and Clinton NC were efficient representatives for the two mega-environments identified for marketable yield, fruit count, and % early fruit. College Station TX and Woodland CA represented one mega-environment, and Clinton NC represented a second for % cull fruit. The subdivision of major watermelon producing states for fruit size could not be justified. Identification of mega-environments for watermelon in the southern US has implications for future breeding and genotype evaluation in the US, including the use of specialized genotypes for the mega-environments identified to achieve optimum adaptation.					10th EUCARPIA Meeting on Genetics and Breeding of Cucurbitaceae10th EUCARPIA Meeting on Genetics and Breeding of Cucurbitaceae	OCT 15-18, 2012OCT 15-18, 2012	European Assoc Res Plant Breeding; Cukurova Univ; Minis Food, Agr & Livestock; Turkish Sci & Technol Council; Antalya Tarim; Manier Seed; Yuksel Seed; Syngenta; AG Seed; Fito Seed; Multi Seed; Nunhems; Rijk Zwaan; Bati Akdeniz Agr Res Inst; Alata Hort Res StatEuropean Assoc Res Plant Breeding; Cukurova Univ; Minis Food, Agr & Livestock; Turkish Sci & Technol Council; Antalya Tarim; Manier Seed; Yuksel Seed; Syngenta; AG Seed; Fito Seed; Multi Seed; Nunhems; Rijk Zwaan; Bati Akdeniz Agr Res Inst; Alata Hort Res Stat	Antalya, TURKEYAntalya, TURKEY	1	0	0	0	0	1					978-605-63297-0-8	WOS:000345687100050

Simulations show that the Weibel instability is responsible for generating and amplifying highly nonuniform, small-scale magnetic fields and for particle acceleration. These magnetic fields contribute to the electron's transverse deflection behind the shock. The "jitter" radiation from deflected electrons in turbulent magnetic fields has properties different from synchrotron radiation calculated in a uniform magnetic field. This jitter radiation may be important for understanding the complex time evolution and/or spectral structure of gamma-ray bursts, relativistic jets in general, and supernova remnants. In order to calculate radiation from first principles and go beyond the standard synchrotron model, we have used PIC simulations. We present synthetic spectra to compare with the spectra obtained from Fermi observations.					279th Symposium of the International Astronomical Union279th Symposium of the International Astronomical Union	MAR 12-16, 2012MAR 12-16, 2012	Int Astronom Union; Minist Educ Culture Sport Sci & Technol Japan; Japan Soc Promot Sci; Univ Tokyo, Inst Phys & Math Universe; Tokyo Tech, SW Res Inst, Global COE Program Quantum Phys & Nanoscience; Grant Aid Prior Res Area Decipher Ancient Universe Gamma Ray Bursts; Astronom Soc JapanInt Astronom Union; Minist Educ Culture Sport Sci & Technol Japan; Japan Soc Promot Sci; Univ Tokyo, Inst Phys & Math Universe; Tokyo Tech, SW Res Inst, Global COE Program Quantum Phys & Nanoscience; Grant Aid Prior Res Area Decipher Ancient Universe Gamma Ray Bursts; Astronom Soc Japan	Nikko, JAPANNikko, JAPAN	0	0	0	0	0	0			1743-9213		978-1-107-01979-9	WOS:000393362200080

It remains one of only three surviving examples of an American "castle," a rare type of transitional coastal fort, circular in form and lacking angular bastions. The fort played a minor role during the American Civil War and was subsequently decommissioned, passing through the jurisdiction of a number of different government agencies over the past 150 years. Due to lack of funding, Castle Pinckney has essentially languished in abandonment for over a century. In 2011, as a mitigative and educational effort, and as an effort to bring public attention to a significant endangered resource, a documentation project was undertaken of the fort by the Historic American Buildings Survey and by the Master of Science in Historic Preservation program of Clemson University/College of Charleston. Building on this effort, in 2012-2013 a national student design competition will be held to explore ideas for the adaptive reuse of the site.					1st International Conference on Defence Sites - Heritage and Future1st International Conference on Defence Sites - Heritage and Future	JUN 06-08, 2012JUN 06-08, 2012	Wessex Inst Technol; Wessex Inst Technol Transactions Built Environm; Int Journal Sustainable Dev & PlanningWessex Inst Technol; Wessex Inst Technol Transactions Built Environm; Int Journal Sustainable Dev & Planning	Portsmouth, ENGLANDPortsmouth, ENGLAND	0	0	0	0	0	0			1746-4498		978-1-84564-590-8	WOS:000339353500004

A k-ranking is minimal if decreasing any label violates the definition of ranking. The arank number, psi(r)(G), of G is the maximum value of k such that G has a minimal k-ranking. We completely determine the arank number of the Cartesian product K-n square K-n, and we investigate the arank number of K-n square K-m, where n > m.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1234-3099	2083-5892		WOS:000209151600009

An S-packing k-coloring of a graph G is a mapping from V(G) to {1, 2,..., k} such that vertices with color i have pairwise distance greater than a, and the S-packing chromatic number chi(s)(G) of G is the smallest integer k such that G has an S-packing k-coloring. This concept generalizes the concept of proper coloring (when S = (1,1,1,...)) and broadcast coloring (when S = (1, 2, 3, 4,...)). In this paper, we consider bounds on the parameter and its relationship with other parameters. We characterize the graphs with chi(s) = 2 and determine chi(s) for several common families of graphs.

J	McCubbin, James A; Peach, Hannah; Moore, Dewayne D; Pilcher, June J								Decreased Cognitive/CNS Function in Young Adults at Risk for Hypertension: Effects of Sleep Deprivation.								International journal of hypertension				2012				989345	989345		10.1155/2012/989345			2012	2012	Hypertension has been linked to impaired cognitive/CNS function, and some of these changes may precede development of frank essential hypertension. The stress and fatigue of sleep deprivation may exacerbate these cognitive changes in young adults at risk. We hypothesize that individuals at risk for hypertension will show significant declines in cognitive function during a night of sleep deprivation. Fifty-one young adults were recruited for 28-hour total sleep deprivation studies. Hypertension risk was assessed by mildly elevated resting blood pressure and by family history of hypertension. A series of cognitive memory tasks was given at four test sessions across the sleep deprivation period. Although initially comparable in cognitive performance, persons at risk showed larger declines across the night for several indices of working memory, including code substitution, category, and order recall. These results suggest that cognitive/CNS changes may parallel or precede blood pressure dysregulation in the early stages of hypertension development. The role of CNS changes in the etiology of essential hypertension is discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0				2090-0392		MEDLINE:22315669	22315669

Conductive electroactive polymers (CEPs) are one dimensional organic semiconductors synthesized from aromatic monomers into extended pi-conjugated polymers. The synthesis of CEPs in association with hydrogels produces class of hybrid materials with the conductivity of the CEP and inherent biocompatibility of the hydrogel. CEPs provide a means for the additive electrodeposition of biorecognition molecules to specific nano-and micron-dimensioned metallic and semiconducting sites on microfabricated metallic or semiconductor MEMS devices. Through judicious engineering of repeat unit chemistry, polymer architecture, crosslink density and microstructure, the mechanical, transport and surface properties may be controlled. Implanted, these materials enable programmed low voltage electro-release of factors suitable for mitigating inflammatory response. Finally, these hydrogels can accommodate supramolecular assemblies of CNTs and enzymes supporting direct electron transfer for generation-3 biosensors and implantable biofuel cells.

Journal of nanomaterials				2012										2012	2012	This paper details a facile approach for the synthesis of stable and monodisperse silver nanoparticles performed at ambient/low temperature where Allium sativum (garlic) extract functions as the silver salt reducing agent during nanoparticle synthesis as well as the post-synthesis stabilizing ligands. Varying the synthesis conditions provides control of particle size, size-distribution, and kinetics of particle formation. Infrared spectroscopy, energy dispersive x-ray chemical analysis, and high performance liquid chromatography indicated that the carbohydrates present in the garlic extract are the most likely nanoparticle stabilizing chemistry. The synthesized silver nanoparticles also demonstrate potential for biomeical applications, owing to the 1) enhanced stability in biological media, 2) resistance to oxidation by the addition of H2O2, 3) ease and scalability of synthesis, and 4) lack of harsh chemicals required for synthesis. Cytotoxicity assays indicated no decrease in cellular proliferation for vascular smooth muscle cells and 3T3 fibroblasts at a concentration of 25 mug/ml, confirming that garlic extract prepared silver nanoparticles are ideal candidates for future experimentation and implementation into biomedical applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1687-4110			MEDLINE:24683414	24683414

Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)				926				383	98		10.1007/978-1-62703-002-1_25			2012	2012	As nanotechnology rapidly emerges into a new industry-driven by its enormous potential to revolutionize electronics, materials, and medicine-exposure of living species to discharged nanoparticles has become inevitable. Despite the increased effort on elucidating the environmental impact of nanotechnology, literature on higher plants exposure to nanoparticles remains scarce and often contradictory. Here we present our biophysical methodologies for the study of carbon nanoparticle uptake by Allium cepa cells and rice plants. We address the three essential aspects for such studies: identification of carbon nanoparticles in the plant species, quantification of nanotransport and aggregation in the plant compartments, and evaluation of plant responses to nanoparticle exposure on the cellular and organism level. Considering the close connection between plant and mammalian species in ecological systems especially in the food chain, we draw a direct comparison on the uptake of carbon nanoparticles in plant and mammalian cells. In addition to the above studies, we present methods for assessing the effects of quantum dot adsorption on algal photosynthesis.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1940-6029		MEDLINE:22975977	22975977

These roles are achieved through the coordinated activities of many proteins in the tonoplast (vacuolar membrane), of which the proton pumps and ion transporters have been modified for improved abiotic stress tolerance in transgenic plants. Here we describe a method to manipulate vacuolar H(+)-pyrophosphatase in turfgrass and evaluate the impact of the modified tonoplast on the phenotype, biochemistry, and physiology of the transgenics. Creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) plants overexpressing an Arabidopsis vacuolar H(+)-pyrophosphatase AVP1 exhibited improved growth and enhanced salt tolerance, likely associated with increased photosynthesis, relative water content, proline production, and Na(+) uptake. These transgenic plants also had decreased solute leakage in the leaf tissues and increased concentrations of Na(+), K(+), Cl(-), and total phosphorus in the root tissues. Similar strategies can be employed to manipulate other tonoplast transporters and in other plant species to produce transgenic plants with improved performance under various abiotic stresses.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1940-6029		MEDLINE:22895772	22895772

Sonication-Assisted Synthesis of beta-Mercuric Sulphide Nanoparticles Regular Paper								NANOMATERIALS AND NANOTECHNOLOGY				2						17				2012	2012	The nanoscale semiconductor beta-mercuric sulphide (HgS) has promising applications in electronic and optical fields. Continued development of synthesis methods is needed to expand approaches that produce uniform particles, while avoiding reagents of high toxicity and ecological impact. A solvent-based approach was developed using mercuric chloride and elemental sulphur as the mercury and chalcogenide sources. Ethanol was used as the solvent and sodium hydroxide as the hydrolysis reagent. Use of mild sonication resulted in smaller particles (average 11nm diameter) than without sonication treatment (average 17nm diameter) and continuous nitrogen purging reduced the surface oxygen content of the particles from approximately 25% to 6%. Particle characterization methods included TEM, XRD, XPS, UV-visible absorbance spectroscopy and DLS. The nanoparticles were typically spheres of 10-15nm in diameter. Aggregates formed in aqueous solutions tended to be in the range of 100nm or more. The overall process can be performed simply at room temperature and is comparatively free of toxic chemical hazards. The process does not include surfactants or other stabilizers that could potentially contaminate the nanocrystals. In principle, the method could be applied to synthesis of other metal chalcogenide nanoparticles.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1847-9804			WOS:000208849400017

E. coli ORN178 (EC 178) is the uropathogen that causes recurrent infection by binding specifically to adhesins of DU-145 cells. Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have been used in biodiagnosis of pathogens. In this study we have investigated the binding time of EC 178 to DU-145 cells and the cytotoxicity of plain and mannose functionalized GNPs (Mn-GNPs). It was seen that EC 178 binds to the cells by 3 h of incubation with the cell line, plain 20 nm GNPs decrease the percentage of viable cells in 48 and 72 h, and, Mn-GNPs along with EC 178 exhibit cytotoxic effects at the end of 3 h of incubation with DU-145 cells.

Moench) biorefinery in which all carbohydrate components of the feestock are used for production of fuel ethanol and industrial chemicals. In the first step, the juice is extracted from the stalks. The resulted straw (bagasse) then is pretreated using the soaking in aqueous ammonia (SAA) process, which does not result in significant loss of hemicellulose, to enhance subsequent enzyme hydrolysis for production of fermentable sugars. Following pretreatment the straw is hydrolyzed first with commercial enzyme product containing high hemicellulase activity (Accellerase XY). The xylose-rich solution obtained after solid/liquid separation is used for production of value-added co-products using suitable microorganisms. The value-added co-products produced to demonstrate the feasibility include astaxanthin and D-ribose. The residual solids then are hydrolyzed with commercial enzyme product containing high cellulase activity (Accellerase 1500) with the juice extracted in the first step being used as make-up water. By combining the sugar in the juice with the glucose released from the residual solids by enzyme hydrolysis high ethanol concentrations can be achieved, which results in lower distillation cost than if pure water is used for enzyme hydrolysis and subsequent fermentation as normally performed in cellulosic ethanol production.

Occupational therapy in health care				26	1			1	15		10.3109/07380577.2011.634889			2012-Jan	2012	ABSTRACT Interactive driving simulators may offer a safe and controlled environment for occupational therapists to treat clients with conditions that affect their ability to drive safely. The use of simulators has been mostly limited to research settings. To make appropriate use of this technology, identifying and understanding the needs of clients and medical personnel that simulators can fulfill is important. The current investigation seeks to identify the attitudes of potential clients and physicians regarding the use of driving simulators. Using survey and interview methodology, clients' and physicians' needs in regard to driving and community mobility are investigated in the context of identifying potential applications for simulator technology. In addition, general needs and attitudes about driving in the context of medical practice were identified. Attitudes toward the use of simulators were generally positive, and the desire for a greater ability to understand and treat clients in the context of driving appears strong.									1	0	0	0	0	1				1541-3098		MEDLINE:23899104	23899104

In conventional methods, the highest velocity that can be measured is limited to the range the phase shift between two successively recorded depth profiles at the same probe-beam location, which cannot exceed (-pi, pi), otherwise phase wrapping will occur. This phase-wrapping limit is determined by the time interval between two consecutive A-scans. We present a novel approach to shorten the time interval between two consecutive A-scans and thus increase the phase-wrapping limit by using an area scan camera to record the interference spectrum in a streak mode. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, the blood flows in HH18 and HH19 chick hearts were imaged and phase wrapping free Doppler images were obtained.

Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity				2012				718491	718491					2012	2012	Aging is a complex and inevitable biological process that is associated with numerous chronically debilitating health effects. Development of effective interventions for promoting healthy aging is an active but challenging area of research. Mechanistic studies in various model organisms, noticeably two invertebrates, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, have identified many genes and pathways as well as dietary interventions that modulate lifespan and healthspan. These studies have shed light on some of the mechanisms involved in aging processes and provide valuable guidance for developing efficacious aging interventions. Nutraceuticals made from various plants contain a significant amount of phytochemicals with diverse biological activities. Phytochemicals can modulate many signaling pathways that exert numerous health benefits, such as reducing cancer incidence and inflammation, and promoting healthy aging. In this paper, we outline the current progress in aging intervention studies using nutraceuticals from an evolutionary perspective in invertebrate models.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1942-0994		MEDLINE:22991584	22991584

Plant signaling & behavior				7	1			4	6		10.4161/psb.7.1.18491			2012-Jan	2012	Encoding a conserved protein of unknown function, the Medicago truncatula RDN1 gene is involved in autoregulation of nodulation through signaling in the root. In contrast, the SUNN kinase in M. truncatula has been shown by grafting of mutant scions to control nodule number in the root by communication of a signal from the shoot to the root. GUS staining patterns resulting from expression of the SUNN promoter fused to uidA showed expression of SUNN in most parts of plant including the root, but confined to the vascular tissue, a pattern that overlaps with that published for RDN1. Real Time qRT-PCR analysis showed levels of both SUNN RNA and RDN1 RNA did not change significantly during early nodulation signaling (0-72 hours after inoculation). The similarity in expression in cell types strongly suggests vascular signaling for nodule number regulation, while the lack of changes over early nodule development suggest post transcriptional mechanisms such as protein association or phosphorylation transmit the signal.									4	0	0	4	0	4				1559-2324		MEDLINE:22301956	22301956

J	Ullmann, Gerhild; Williams, Harriet G; Plass, Cora F								Dissemination of an evidence-based program to reduce fear of falling, South Carolina, 2006-2009.								Preventing chronic disease				9				E103	E103					2012	2012	INTRODUCTION: Falls among older adults are a serious public health issue, and fear of falling can limit mobility, which in turn increases fall risk. A Matter of Balance/Volunteer Lay Leader Model is an evidence-based program designed to address fear of falling. The objective of this study was to describe implementation, dissemination, and outcomes of this program in 3 regions of South Carolina with a predominantly African American and largely underserved population.METHODS: We developed partnerships throughout the state, organized master and lay leader trainings, and documented numbers of lay leaders, programs offered, demographic characteristics of participants, program fidelity, and attendance. Outcome measures were self-reported confidence to prevent and manage falls and a quantitative measure of functional mobility. Both measures were assessed at baseline and after program completion.RESULTS: Older adults (N = 235) attended 18 classes at 16 sites. Barriers to implementation were program teams' limited familiarity with the concept of evidence-based programs and the importance of adhering to program content. Facilitators were state-level leadership and a history of state, regional, and local groups collaborating successfully on other projects. Outcomes indicated greater confidence in managing falls and carrying out activities of daily living. Mobility improved significantly, suggesting a reduced risk for falls.CONCLUSION: Evidence-based programs such as A Matter of Balance/Volunteer Lay Leader Model can be successfully disseminated in underserved areas. Outcomes indicate that participation in fall prevention programs can benefit groups of predominantly African American older adults.									2	0	0	0	0	2				1545-1151		MEDLINE:22632740	22632740

Our group has recently developed a new method that exploits the intrinsic curvature of microchannel walls for a diverse electrical control of particle and cell motions, which is termed Curvature-induced Dielectrophoresis (C-iDEP). Due to the variation in path length for electric current, the electric field becomes inherently non-uniform within a microchannel turn. Thus induced DEP can generate a cross-stream particle motion, which is a nonlinear function of electric field and superimposed to the linear electrokinetic motion enabling flexible particle manipulations. This paper presents our recent results on the deflection, focusing, filtration, and separation of particles and cells in curved microchannels by the use of C-iDEP.					10th International Conference on Nanochannels, Microchannels and Minichannels10th International Conference on Nanochannels, Microchannels and Minichannels	JUL 08-12, 2012JUL 08-12, 2012	ASME, Fluids Engn DivASME, Fluids Engn Div	ASME, Heat Transfer Div, Rio Grande, PRASME, Heat Transfer Div, Rio Grande, PR	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-4479-3	WOS:000335090900083

In this paper, we explore what type of metering infrastructure may be required to derive value from the application of smart meters in the commercial and industrial sectors. As an example, we find that sole reliance upon a site-level smart meter which has been the focus of most existing deployment models provides sufficient data to extract summary statistics about how the energy use of a given site may compare to a typical 'average' site, but such installations fail to provide adequate detail about where the energy use is occurring or why any discrepancies might be occurring. To resolve these issues, we install a multi-tier advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) at a mixed use (industrial and commercial) campus. We use this AMI deployment to gain insight at different levels of the consumption hierarchy from sites to buildings, panels, sub-panels, and end loads. The paper concludes by discussing the trade-offs associated with such augmented metering at each level within the hierarchy, with a view towards providing guidelines for AMI deployment at other industrial and commercial campuses.					6th ASME International Conference on Energy Sustainability6th ASME International Conference on Energy Sustainability	JUL 23-26, 2012JUL 23-26, 2012	ASME, Adv Energy Syst Div; ASME, Solar Energy DivASME, Adv Energy Syst Div; ASME, Solar Energy Div	San Diego, CASan Diego, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-4481-6	WOS:000335710300113

ASME					ENERGY HARVESTING UNDER COMBINED AERODYNAMIC AND BASE EXCITATIONS								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME CONFERENCE ON SMART MATERIALS, ADAPTIVE STRUCTURES AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS, VOL 1								247	257					2012	2012	This paper investigates the transduction of a piezoaeroelastic energy harvester under combined base and aerodynamic loadings. The harvester consists of a typical rigid airfoil supported by hardening flexural and torsional springs. The airfoil is placed in an incompressible air flow and subjected to a harmonic base excitation in the plunge direction. Considering a nonlinear quasi-steady aerodynamic model, the response behavior and electric output of the harvester are analyzed near the flutter instability. A center manifold reduction is implemented to reduce the original five-dimensional system into one nonlinear first-order ordinary differential equation. Subsequently, the normal form of the reduced system is derived to study slow modulation of the voltage amplitude and phase. Several case studies are presented indicating a considerable improvement in the output voltage of the harvester under the combined loading even when the air speed is below the flutter velocity, i.e., even when the harvester cannot maintain steady-state periodic oscillations in the absence of the harmonic base excitation. It is also shown that, when the base-excitation amplitude is sufficiently large and its frequency is close to the frequency of the self-sustained limit-cycle oscillations emanating from the flutter instability, the periodic solution resulting from the base excitation entrains the self-sustained oscillations yielding a periodic output voltage. However, when the excitation frequency is far from the limit-cycle frequency, or the amplitude of base excitation is small, the voltage is two-period quasiperiodic.

ASME					CYCLE-BY-CYCLE AIR-TO-FUEL RATIO CALCULATION DURING TRANSIENT ENGINE OPERATION USING FAST RESPONSE CO AND CO2 SENSORS								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE DIVISION FALL TECHNICAL CONFERENCE - 2012								303	+					2012	2012	Stringent engine emission regulations highlight the importance of proper engine control during transient operation. In recent years, fast emissions analyzers that measure CO and CO2 simultaneously have allowed for fast air-to-fuel ratio (AFR) calculation under steady-state engine operation. However, using a steady-state methodology to calculate APR under transient conditions can lead to significant data interpretation errors. This research introduces an experimental cycle-by-cycle APR calculation routine developed for transient operation using cycle-resolved CO2 and CO analyzers. Need for the new technique arises when the composition of recycled exhaust gases vary significantly from expected post-combustion products corresponding to the true in-cylinder APR. This condition commonly occurs when APR is changed from one cycle to the next. The peak difference between the new method and traditional methods is demonstrated to be in the range of 0.1 relative air-to-fuel ratio points, or approximately 10%. These results are for low dilution conditions where the new method should show minimal difference as compared to traditional methods. If residual gas fraction levels were increased the difference in corrected to uncorrected results would become even greater, motivating the use of the new method in high-dilution engines.

ASME					METHOD FOR DETERMINING INSTANTANEOUS TEMPERATURE AT THE SURFACE OF COMBUSTION CHAMBER DEPOSITS IN AN HCCI ENGINE								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE DIVISION FALL TECHNICAL CONFERENCE - 2012								465	+					2012	2012	Homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) combustion is widely regarded an attractive option for future high efficiency gasoline engines. HCCI combustion permits operation with a highly dilute, well mixed charge, resulting in high thermal efficiency and extremely low NO and soot emissions, two qualities essential for future propulsion system solutions.Because HCCI is a thermo-kinetically dominated process, full understanding of how combustion chamber boundary thermal conditions affect the combustion process are crucial. This includes the dynamics of the effective chamber wall surface temperature, as dictated by the formation of combustion chamber deposits (CCD). It has been demonstrated that, due to the combination of CCD thermal properties and the sensitivity of HCCI to wall temperature, the phasing of auto-ignition can vary significantly as CCD coverage in the chamber increases.In order to better characterize and quantify the influence of CCDs, a numerical methodology has been developed which permits calculation of the crank-angle resolved local temperature profile at the surface of a layer of combustion chamber deposits. This unique predictor-corrector methodology relies on experimental measurement of instantaneous temperature underneath the layer, i.e. at the metal-CCD interface, and known deposit layer thickness. A numerical method for validation of these calculations has also been devised. The resultant crank-angle resolved CCD surface temperature and heat flux profiles both on top and under the CCD layer provide valuable insight into the near wall phenomena, and shed light on the interplay between the dynamics of the heat transfer process and HCCI burn rates.

ASME					DESIGN OF A STEPPED TUBE EXHAUST PRIMARY FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE APPLICATIONS USING UNSTEADY COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE DIVISION FALL TECHNICAL CONFERENCE - 2012								915	927					2012	2012	High performance naturally-aspirated internal combustion engines require effective use of exhaust pressure waves during the gas exchange process to maximize volumetric efficiency and torque. Under certain conditions sudden increases, or steps, in exhaust runner diameter are used to control pressure wave reflections to provide appropriately timed low pressure waves to the cylinder that reduce pumping work and improve air scavenging. This research evaluates gas exchange performance for an exhaust port and an attached stepped-tube primary using unsteady conditions with 1-D and 3-D CFD. The objectives of this research are to (1) discuss the importance of using unsteady flow simulations in the design of high performance exhaust systems, (2) describe the use of stepped-runners to provide performance gains, and (3) discuss the influence of runner step geometry and the number of steps on gas exchange. Simulations are correlated with experimental data to ensure accuracy of the results. A correlation is found between the step size and the magnitude as well as phase of tuning effects. The number of steps is also found to have a direct impact on tuning. The pumping work of the cycle was significantly affected by the stepped primary design, while the scavenging efficiency was not.

Commercial fuels can differ considerably in composition and auto-ignition chemistry, hence strategies intended to bring HCCI to market must account for this fuel variability.To this end, a test matrix consisting of eight gasoline fuels comprised of blends made solely from refinery streams were run in an experimental, single cylinder HCCI engine. All fuels contained 10% ethanol by volume and were representative of a cross-section of fuels one would expect to find at gasoline pumps across the United States. The properties of the fuels were varied according to research octane number (RON), sensitivity (S=RON-MON) and volumetric content of aromatics and olefins.For each fuel, a sweep of load (mass of fuel injected per cycle) was conducted and the intake air temperature was adjusted in order to keep the crank angle of the 50% mass fraction burned point (CA50) constant. By analyzing the amount of temperature compensation required to maintain constant combustion phasing, it was possible to determine the sensitivity of HCCI to changes in load for various fuels.In addition, the deviation of fuel properties brought about variations in important engine performance metrics like specific fuel consumption. Though the injected energy content per cycle was matched at the baseline point across the test fuel matrix, thermodynamic differences resulted in a spread of specific fuel consumption for the fuels tested.

The accepted explanation for bonding is that stresses due to both compression and friction stemming from the interfacial motion between the foils result in plasticity and ultimately produce a metallurgical bond. The process however, has been shown to have a critical shortcoming in its operation; namely, the presence of a range of build heights within which bonding cannot be initiated. To better understand the reasons for this anomaly, this paper simplifies the process into a lumped parameter dry friction oscillator and shows that complex stick-slip motions of the build feature near or above its resonance frequency may explain bond degradation. Specifically, it is shown through bifurcation maps. obtained for different process parameters that, at the critical build heights, the feature exhibits pure stick motions due to primary resonant interactions between the external excitation and the feature. Furthermore, complex aperiodic responses are observed at build heights above resonance (short features). In such scenarios, bonding cannot be initiated because no or non-uniform interfacial motions occur between the tape and the feature. It is also observed that, once the height of the build feature increases beyond the critical value corresponding to resonance, periodic uniform responses essential for bonding, are recovered. These results corroborates previous experimental findings which demonstrate that bonding can be hard to initiate near or slightly above resonance (at or slightly below a critical height) but can be reinitiated below resonance (above the critical height).					24th Conference on Mechanical Vibration and Noise24th Conference on Mechanical Vibration and Noise	AUG 12-15, 2012AUG 12-15, 2012	ASME, Design Engn Div; ASME, Comp & Informat Engn DivASME, Design Engn Div; ASME, Comp & Informat Engn Div	Chicago, ILChicago, IL	2	0	0	0	0	2					978-0-7918-4500-4	WOS:000335091200061

ASME					ON UTILIZING APPROXIMATE MODAL SHAPES TO ESTIMATE THE EFFECTIVE NONLINEARITY OF A STRUCTURAL MODE								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE 2012, VOL 1, PTS A AND B								879	886					2012	2012	This effort investigates the accuracy of estimating the effective nonlinearity of a given vibration mode using approximate modal shapes. As an example, the problem of approximating the modal effective nonlinearities of a linearly-tapered cantilever beam (along the width) is considered. This example was intentionally selected because the linear eigenvalue problem cannot be solved analytically for the exact eigenfrequencies and actual linear mode shapes of the structure, which permits investigating the influence of approximating the mode shapes on the effective nonlinearity. The nonlinear partial differential equation governing the beam's motion is first discretized into an infinite set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The method of multiple scales is then utilized to obtain an approximate analytical expression for the effective nonlinearity which depends on the assumed mode shapes used in the series discretization. To approximate the mode shapes, three methods were utilized: i) a crude approach which directly utilizes the linear modes of a regular (untapered) cantilever beam to estimate the effective nonlinearity, ii) a finite element approach wherein the structural modes are obtained in ANSYS, then fitted into orthonormal polynomial curves while minimizing the least square error in calculating the eigenfrequencies, and iii) a Rayleigh-Ritz approach which utilizes a set of orthonormal trial basis functions to construct the structural mode shapes as a linear combination of the trial functions used. A comparison among the three methods for eight different taperings reveals that, while the modal frequencies are well-approximated yielding less than 2% deviation, among the three methods, there is a huge discrepancy in approximating the nonlinear coefficients including the effective nonlinearity. This leads to the conclusion that convergence of the eigenfrequencies is not sufficient for accurate estimation of the nonlinear parameters.					24th Conference on Mechanical Vibration and Noise24th Conference on Mechanical Vibration and Noise	AUG 12-15, 2012AUG 12-15, 2012	ASME, Design Engn Div; ASME, Comp & Informat Engn DivASME, Design Engn Div; ASME, Comp & Informat Engn Div	Chicago, ILChicago, IL	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-4500-4	WOS:000335091200097

Many of the current assembly time estimation tools require information which is not available until the product is in the production phase. Furthermore, these tools often require subjective inputs which limit the degree of automation provided by the method. The assembly of a vehicle depends on information about the product and information describing the process. The research presented in this paper explains the development and testing of an assembly time estimation method that uses process language as the input for the analysis.

This model is then used to develop a Design for Assembly (DFA) automation tool that can predict a product's assembly time using defined mate connections within Solid Works assembly models. The development of this new method consists of: creating a Solid Works (SW) Add-in to automatically extract the mate connections from SW assembly models, parsing the mate connections into graphs, implementing a new complexity training algorithm to predict assembly times based on mate graphs, and evaluating the effectiveness of the new method. The motivation, development, and evaluation of the new automated DFA method are presented in this paper. Ultimately, the method that is trained on both fully defined and partially defined assembly models is shown to provide assembly time prediction results that are typically within 25% of target time, but with one outlier at 95% error, suggesting that a more robust training set is needed.

Therefore, the quality of requirement statements is essential to the success of a design. Because of their ergonomic-nature, most requirements are written in natural language (NL). However, writing requirements in natural language presents many issues such as ambiguity, specification issues, and incompleteness. Therefore, identifying issues in requirements involves analyzing these NL statements. This paper presents a linguistic approach to requirement analysis, which utilizes grammatical elements of requirements statements to identify requirement statement issues. These issues are organized by the entity word, sentence, or document that they affect. The field of natural language processing (NLP) provides a core set of tools that can aid with this linguistic analysis and provide a method to create a requirement analysis support tool. NLP addresses requirements on processing levels: lexical, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic. While processing on the lexical and syntactic level are well-defined, mining semantic and pragmatic data is performed in a number of different methods. This paper provides an overview of these current requirement analysis methods in light of the presented linguistic approach. This overview will be used to identify areas for further research and development. Finally, a prototype requirement analysis support tool will be presented. This tool seeks to demonstrate how the semantic processing level can begin to be addressed in requirement analysis. The tool will analyze a sample set of requirements from a family of military tactical vehicles (FMTV) requirements document. It implements NLP tools to semantically compare requirements statements based upon their grammatical subject.

Because they are essential to the entire design process, emphasis must be placed on ensuring that they are correct. This research focuses on a value-based methodology useful for challenging and validating established requirements. A case study was conducted on an industry-sponsored project to use this value-based process on the requirements that constrain the design of an automotive seat. A human anthropomorphic model, comfort value model, occupant safety model, and a model of an automotive seat are integrated to establish an H-point travel window to maximize the safety and comfort of an automotive seating structure. This case study shows that this approach provides evidence to establish requirements based on value to the human rather than legacy seating requirements.

As a result of these factors, assembly time estimation is rarely applied during early design iterations. This paper explores the possibility that the assembly time estimation process can be automated while reducing the level of design detail required. The approach presented here trains artificial neural networks (ANNs) to estimate the assembly times of vehicle sub-assemblies at various stages using properties of the connectivity graph at that point as input data. Effectiveness of estimation is evaluated based on the distribution of estimates provided by a population of ANNs trained on the same input data using varying initial conditions. Results suggest that the method presented here can complete the time estimation of an assembly process with +/- 15% error given an initial sample of manually estimated times for the given sub-assembly.

B	Manh Tien Nguyen; Fadel, Georges M.; Guarneri, Paolo; Mata, Ivan			ASME					GENETIC ALGORITHMS APPLIED TO AFFORDANCE BASED DESIGN								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE 2012, VOL 3, PTS A AND B								689	+					2012	2012	Affordance based design (ABD) theory has been presented in several papers and has interested several researchers in the field of design. One criticism of ABD is that the number of affordances identified can be very large, and therefore, the approach may not be amenable for automation. This paper presents a computer based implementation of a process to improve design using affordances.The Affordance Structure Matrix (ASM) design tool is used to identify relevant relationships between the design parameters of an artifact and the affordances (positive and negative) identified by the user. This initial work investigates multiple existing solutions. A user assigns values to critical affordances that are listed in an ASM by visualizing the possible solutions. The parameter values that describe the architecture of the artifact are encoded and fed to a computer code in addition to the multiple affordance values. A Genetic Algorithm is then used to find an optimal combination of design parameters based on the multiple criteria, the affordances, generating new and better concepts.The approach is applied to the redesign of a steering wheel. Multiple variants of steering wheels available in the literature are presented to the user. After twenty generations of the genetic algorithm, using an additive weighting method, an optimal solution is found and presented.

Though, these design changes enhance the overall vehicle performance to an extent, the placement of these components under the car hood also plays a vital role in increasing the vehicle performance. In the past, a study on the automobile underhood packaging or layout problem was conducted and a multi-objective optimization routine with three objectives namely, minimizing center of gravity height, maximizing vehicle components accessibility and maximizing survivability (for army vehicles) has been setup to determine the optimal locations of the underhood components. The previous study did not consider thermal performance as an objective. This study asserts the necessity of including thermal performance as an objective and makes an assessment of the several available thermal analyses that are performed on the automotive underhood to evaluate the thermal objective. A Neural Network approximation of the CFD analysis conducted over the automotive underhood is presented in this paper. The results obtained from the Neural Network are compared with the CFD results, showing good agreement. The Neural Network model is included in the multi-objective optimization routine and new layout results are obtained. A non-deterministic evolutionary multi-objective algorithm (AMGA-2) is used to perform the optimization process.

This paper studies a network target coordination model for optimizing subsystems that are distributed as multiple agents in a network. To solve these coupled subsystems concurrently, we consider the "consensus optimization" approach by incorporating sub gradient algorithms so that the master problem or auxiliary design variables required by most distributed coordination methods are not needed. The method allows each agent to conduct its optimization by locally solving for coupling variables with the information obtained from other agents in the network in an iteratively improving process. The convergence results of a geometric programming problem that satisfies the convexity assumption is provided. Moreover, two non-convex examples are tested to investigate the convergence characteristics of the proposed methods.

In order to reduce the hysteretic rolling loss, an elastic material is used and the shear layer microstructure is defined to achieve high compliance comparable to that offered by the elastomeric materials. To simulate the meta-material properties of the shear layer, the volume averaging analysis, instead of more popular homogenization methods, is used as the relative size of the shear layer places realistic manufacturing constraints on the size of unit cells used to generate the meta-material. In this design scenario the properties predicted by the homogenization methods are not accurate since the homogenization scaling assumptions are violated. A number of optimal designs are shown to have meta-material properties similar to those of the linear elastic properties of elastomers, making them good meta-material candidates for the shear layer of the non-pneumatic wheel.

B	Jones, Joshua J.; Mears, Laine			ASME					THERMAL RESPONSE CHARACTERIZATION OF SHEET METALS DURING ELECTRICALLY-ASSISTED FORMING (EAF)								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, 2012								189	198					2012	2012	For the current practice of lightweight engineering in the automotive sector, it is common to introduce and use low density/high strength materials instead of costly engine/drivetrain technologies. With the introduction of these materials there are commonly many manufacturing difficulties which arise during their incorporation to the vehicle. As a result, new processes which improve the manufacturability of these materials are necessary. This work examines the manufacturing technique of Electrically-Assisted Forming (EAF) where an electrical current is applied to the workpiece during deformation. As a result of the applied current, Joule heating is present which increases the temperature of the material. In this work the thermal response of sheet metal for stationary and deformation tests using this process are explored and modeled. The results of the model show good agreement for the stationary tests while the deformation model predicts that all of the applied electrical current may not be transformed into Joule heating. Thus, this work suggests from the observed response that a portion of the applied current may be directly aiding in deformation (i.e. the Electroplastic Effect).

J	Degenhardt, David C.; Greene, Jeremy K.; Khalilian, Ahmad								Temporal Dynamics and Electronic Nose Detection of Stink Bug-Induced Volatile Emissions from Cotton Bolls.								Psyche (Cambridge)								236762	236762					2012	2012	Management decisions for stink bugs (Pentatomidae) in Bt cotton are complicated by time-consuming sampling methods, and there is a need for more efficient detection tools. Volatile compounds are released from cotton bolls in response to feeding by stink bugs, and electronic nose (E-nose) technology may be useful for detecting boll damage. In this study, we investigated the temporal dynamics of volatile emissions in response to feeding by stink bugs and tested the ability of E-nose to discriminate between odors from healthy and injured bolls. Feeding by stink bugs led to an approximate 2.4-fold increase in volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. Principal components analysis of E-nose sensor data showed distinct (100%) separation between stink bug-injured and healthy bolls after two days of feeding. However, when E-nose was used to randomly identify samples, results were less accurate (80-90%). These results suggest that E-nose is a promising technology for rapid detection of stink bug injury to cotton.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0033-2615; 1687-7438			ZOOREC:ZOOR15103013369

Studies in health technology and informatics				173				469	74					2012	2012	Though several simulators and training methods are available for basic laparoscopic skills, few have addressed force-based skills. In this work, we discuss a haptic simulator that renders virtual materials of different stiffness profiles to be used for haptic skills differentiation. A force-based task was designed on the simulator and the performance of surgeons and novices was analyzed. Results indicate that surgeons and novices differ in their ability to use the haptic device to reproduce target stiffness levels. This work provides an important step towards quantifying haptic skill metrics for the design of surgical skills training simulators.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0926-9630			MEDLINE:22357038	22357038

The health care manager				31	1			44	51		10.1097/HCM.0b013e318242d285			2012 Jan-Mar	2012	Since the University of Chicago Health Management program was first initiated in 1932, programs and health delivery organizations have dealt with the issue of how to best provide a meaningful transition from academia to entry-level management. Today, new challenges face the same old questions: New federal legislation and increased demand for a finite supply of services cause increased revenue and expense pressures and result in the need for a higher performance level by a well-coordinated management team. In addressing these challenges, mentoring is an essential requirement for survival and success in health services. The long-term success of future practitioners will require both an understanding and incorporation of mentoring in their skill set. The University of Virginia Medical Center recently sponsored a health management education summit to examine the role of mentoring in health services administration education. Leading the program were John Westerman, former interim president of Association of University Programs in Healthcare Administration and chief executive officer emeritus of the University of Minnesota Health System, and R. Edward Howell, chief executive officer of the University of Virginia Medical Center. Summit participants included individuals who had completed administrative fellowship training programs. What follows is a review of the discussions during the summit, including a valuation of the health services fellowship as a learning experience as well as structure and essential elements of administrative mentoring programs.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1550-512X		MEDLINE:22281997	22281997

Small-bias sets are probability spaces that in some sense approximate larger ones. Error-correcting codes have provided explicit constructions of such spaces. For instance, the concatenation of a Reed-Solomon code with a Hadamard code provides a now standard construction. Recently, Ben-Aroya and Ta-Shma used Hermitian codes to construct small-bias sets [4]. In this paper, we consider small-bias sets constructed from the extended norm-trace function field F-qr (x, y)/F-qr defined by TrFqr/F-q (y) = x(u) where q is a power of a prime, r >= 2, and ul here, u vertical bar q(r) - 1/q - 1; here, Tr-Fqr/Fq denotes the trace with respect to the extension F(q)r/F-q. The Hermitian function field y(q) +y = x(q+1), its quotient y(q) + y = x(u) where u vertical bar q+1, and the norm-trace function field given by Tr-Fqr/F-q (y) = N-Fqr/Fq (x) are special cases of the extended norm-trace function field. We detail the resulting small-bias sets.					10th International Conference on Finite Fields and Their Applications10th International Conference on Finite Fields and Their Applications	JUL 11-15, 2011JUL 11-15, 2011	Belgian Fundamental Res Cryptol & Informat Secur; Elsevier; FWO Res Fdn; Ghent Univ, Res Fund Fac Sci; KU, Dept Elect Engn, Res Grp ESAT COSIC; Ghent Univ, Dept Math, Res Grp Incidence GeometryBelgian Fundamental Res Cryptol & Informat Secur; Elsevier; FWO Res Fdn; Ghent Univ, Res Fund Fac Sci; KU, Dept Elect Engn, Res Grp ESAT COSIC; Ghent Univ, Dept Math, Res Grp Incidence Geometry	Ghent, BELGIUMGhent, BELGIUM	0	0	0	0	0	0			0271-4132		978-0-8218-5298-9	WOS:000310759900013

J	Asl, Kaveh Meshinchi; Luo, Jian				Luo, Jian/A-4777-2008				Impurity effects on the intergranular liquid bismuth penetration in polycrystalline nickel								ACTA MATERIALIA				60	1			149	165		10.1016/j.actamat.2011.09.034			JAN 2012	2012	The effects of impurities on the intergranular penetration of Bi based liquids in polycrystalline Ni at 700 degrees C were systematically investigated. In comparison with a nominally pure Ni (99.9945%), the presence of a total amount of <0.5 at.% impurities of Mn, Fe and Si in the Ni increased the penetration length by six times when a near-equilibrium Bi-Ni liquid was applied; when an initially pure Bi liquid was applied, this increment further enlarged to similar to 20 times in the initial penetration stage. In a second set of controlled experiments, the addition of Mn, Sn and Fe to the liquid Bi-Ni all enhanced the intergranular penetration, but produced different kinetics and morphologies. We extended a concept that was initially proposed in the Rice-Wang model for grain boundary embrittlement to explain our observations of the impurity-enhanced intergranular penetration based on a theory that segregation of an impurity could reduce the grain boundary energy more rapidly than the solid-liquid interfacial energy. Correspondingly, a new analytical model for the effect of adding a third impurity on changing the equilibrium dihedral angle and the associated intergranular penetration kinetics has been derived for the dilute solution limit. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the interplay of bulk phase equilibria, interfacial segregation, transport (dissolution, precipitation and diffusion) processes and stress generation could effectively explain a variety of different intergranular penetration behaviors and morphologies that have been observed in the experiments conducted using 10 different combinations of the solid and liquid metals. The framework for understanding the impurity effects on intergranular liquid penetration developed in this study can be applied to other materials systems. This study has practically importance for understanding and controlling liquid metal corrosion and embrittlement. (C) 2011 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Porcine vena cava as an alternative to bovine pericardium in bioprosthetic percutaneous heart valves								BIOMATERIALS				33	1			1	8		10.1016/j.biomaterials.2011.09.027			JAN 2012	2012	Percutaneous heart valves are revolutionizing valve replacement surgery by offering a less invasive treatment option for high-risk patient populations who have previously been denied the traditional open chest procedure. Percutaneous valves need to be crimped to accommodate a small-diameter catheter during deployment, and they must then open to the size of heart valve. Thus the material used must be strong and possess elastic recoil for this application. Most percutaneous valves utilize bovine pericardium as a material of choice. One possible method to reduce the device delivery diameter is to utilize a thin, highly elastic tissue. Here we investigated porcine vena cava as an alternative to bovine pericardium for percutaneous valve application. We compared the structural, mechanical, and in vivo properties of porcine vena cava to those of bovine pericardium. While the extracellular matrix fibers of pericardium are randomly oriented, the vena cava contains highly aligned collagen and elastin fibers that impart strength to the vessel in the circumferential direction and elasticity in the longitudinal direction. Moreover, the vena cava contains a greater proportion of elastin, whereas the pericardium matrix is mainly composed of collagen. Due to its high elastin content, the vena cava is significantly less stiff than the pericardium, even after crosslinking with glutaraldehyde. Furthermore, the vena cava's mechanical compliance is preserved after compression under forces similar to those exerted by a stent, whereas pericardium is significantly stiffened by this process. Bovine pericardium also showed surface cracks observed by scanning electron microscopy after crimping that were not seen in vena cava tissue. Additionally, the vena cava exhibited reduced calcification (46.64 +/- 8.15 mu g Ca/mg tissue) as compared to the pericardium (86.79 +/- 10.34 mu g/mg). These results suggest that the vena cava may provide enhanced leaflet flexibility, tissue resilience, and tissue integrity in percutaneous heart valves, ultimately reducing the device profile while improving the durability of these valves.

J	Cass, Cheryl A. P.; Burg, Karen J. L.								Tannic Acid Cross-linked Collagen Scaffolds and Their Anti-cancer Potential in a Tissue Engineered Breast Implant								JOURNAL OF BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE-POLYMER EDITION				23	1-4			281	298		10.1163/092050610X550331			2012	2012	Tannic acid (TA) is a hydrolysable plant tannin, and it has been determined that TA functions as a collagen cross-linking agent through hydrogen-bonding mechanisms and hydrophobic effects. Since TA may have anti-tumor properties, it may be a viable cross-linking agent for collagen-based breast tissue scaffolds. The goal of this work was to determine if TA cross-linked scaffolds induce apoptotic processes in MCF-7 cancer cells, with minimal toxic effect on healthy D1 mesenchymal stem-like stromal cells. Cross-linked collagen scaffolds that were uniform, easily reproduced, easily characterized, and readily used in cell culture were manufactured. Thermal denaturation temperatures of the cross-linked scaffolds (68 degrees C) were shown to be significantly higher when compared to those of uncross-linked scaffolds (55 degrees C). Scanning electron microscopy images demonstrated the replacement of irregular collagen fibers with sheet-like structures upon cross-linking. The cross-linking solution concentration of TA that appears to be best for inducing apoptotic processes in MCF-7 cells, while minimizing toxic effect on D1 cells, is 1 mg/ml. At this concentration, the MCF-7 cell metabolic activity did not change over a 72-h period (i.e., proliferation was limited) while there was an increase in metabolic activity of D1 cells over the 72-h period. TA did appear to inhibit the production of lipid by D1 cells cultured in an adipogenic cocktail; in the future, the rate and duration of inhibition could be tailored to allow gradual bulking of the implant. The results suggest that the level of TA cross-linking can be modulated to provide optimal use in a tissue engineering composite.

Effects of long-term aging on moisture sensitivity of foamed WMA mixtures containing moist aggregates								MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES				45	1-2			251	264		10.1617/s11527-011-9763-4			JAN 2012	2012	Long-term aging of an asphalt mixture is complicated, but can be simulated in the laboratory. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of long-term aging on moisture susceptibility of foamed warm mix asphalt (WMA) mixtures containing moist aggregate. Weight loss, indirect tensile strength (ITS) of dry and conditioned specimens, and deformation (flow) were measured for all mixtures. The experimental design included two aggregate moisture contents (0 and similar to 0.5% by weight of the dry mass of the aggregate); two lime contents (1 and 2% lime by weight of dry aggregate) and one liquid anti-stripping agent (ASA); one foaming WMA additive (Asphamin) and two foaming water contents (2 and 3%); and two aggregate sources. A common long-term aging procedure was used in this study. A total of 64 mixtures were evaluated and 256 specimens were made and tested in this study. The test results indicated that long-term aging improved the moisture resistance of WMA mixtures regardless of the ASA and moisture conditioning. In addition, aggregate source significantly affected the moisture resistance regardless of the foaming technology, ASA, and aggregate moisture content. The mixture with various hydrated lime contents exhibited similar moisture resistance under dry and wet conditions. The liquid ASA used in the WMA mixture showed a weaker resistance to the moisture damage in comparison with hydrated lime.									7	1	0	0	1	9			1359-5997			WOS:000297810900018

To gain insight into the U sequestration mechanism in the amorphous ferric oxyhydroxide (AFO)-coated gravel PRB, U(VI) sorption processes on ferrihydrite surfaces were studied in 0.01 M Na(2)SO(4) solutions to simulate the major chemical composition of U-contaminated groundwater (i.e., [SO(4)(2-)] similar to 13 mM L(-1)) at the site. Uranyl sorption was greater at pH 7.5 than that at pH 4 in both air- and 2% pCO(2)-equilibrated systems. While there were negligible effects of sulfate ligands on the pH-dependent U(VI) sorption (<24 h) in both systems, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis showed sulfate ligand associated U(VI) surface species at the ferrihydrite-water interface. In air-equilibrated systems, binary and mono-sulfate U(VI) ternary surface species co-existed at pH 5.43. At pH 6.55-7.83, a mixture of mono-sulfate and bis-carbonato U(VI) ternary surface species became more important. At 2% pCO(2), there was no contribution of sulfate ligands on the U(VI) ternary surface species. Instead, a mixture of bis-carbonato inner-sphere (38%) and tris-carbonato outer-sphere U(VI) ternary surface species (62%) was found at pH 7.62. The study suggests that the competitive ligand (bicarbonate and sulfate) coordination on U(VI) surface species might be important in evaluating the U solid-state speciation in the AFO PRB at the study site where pCO(2) fluctuates between 1 and 2 pCO(2)%.

Accessibility of pores in coal to methane and carbon dioxide								FUEL				91	1			200	208		10.1016/j.fuel.2011.06.026			JAN 2012	2012	Fluid-solid interactions in natural and engineered porous solids underlie a variety of technological processes, including geological storage of anthropogenic greenhouse gases, enhanced coal bed methane recovery, membrane separation, and heterogeneous catalysis. The size, distribution and interconnectivity of pores, the chemical and physical properties of the solid and fluid phases collectively dictate how fluid molecules migrate into and through the micro-and meso-porous media, adsorb and ultimately react with the solid surfaces. Due to the high penetration power and relatively short wavelength of neutrons, small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) as well as ultra small-angle scattering (USANS) techniques are ideally suited for assessing the phase behavior of confined fluids under pressure as well as for evaluating the total porosity in engineered and natural porous systems including coal. Here we demonstrate that SANS and USANS can be also used for determining the fraction of the pore volume that is actually accessible to fluids as a function of pore sizes and study the fraction of inaccessible pores as a function of pore size in three coals from the Illinois Basin (USA) and Bowen Basin (Australia). Experiments were performed at CO2 and methane pressures up to 780 bar, including pressures corresponding to zero average contrast condition (ZAC), which is the pressure where no scattering from the accessible pores occurs. Scattering curves at the ZAC were compared with the scattering from same coals under vacuum and analysed using a newly developed approach that shows that the volume fraction of accessible pores in these coals varies between similar to 90% in the macropore region to similar to 30% in the mesopore region and the variation is distinctive for each of the examined coals. The developed methodology may be also applied for assessing the volume of accessible pores in other natural underground formations of interest for CO2 sequestration, such as saline aquifers as well as for estimating closed porosity in engineered porous solids of technological importance.

J	Lamie, R. David; Campbell, Wallace; Molnar, William								The fiscal-geographic nexus: An overview of fiscal impact assessment in local policy development								APPLIED GEOGRAPHY				32	1	SI		54	60		10.1016/j.apgeog.2010.07.007			JAN 2012	2012	Fiscal impact assessments exist to provide decision makers with the tools to make informed decisions regarding local government finances. Every type of change in a community will have a unique impact on the local economy. This impact cannot be evaluated without careful attention to the particular geographic setting of the study. Unfortunately, geography is currently underutilized in the practice of fiscal impact analysis. This paper argues that the increased application of geographic tools is a key to improving the accuracy of fiscal impact reports. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Schoenfuss, Heiko L.; Maie, Takashi; Kawano, Sandy M.; Blob, Richard W.								Performance across extreme environments: comparing waterfall climbing among amphidromous gobioid fishes from Caribbean and Pacific Islands								CYBIUM				35	4			361	369					DEC 31 2011	2011	Amphidromous gobioid fishes have colonized streams on tropical and subtropical volcanic islands across the globe. Such streams are often characterized by steep gradients, high velocity currents, and even waterfalls as in-stream obstacles; however, the ability to climb waterfalls has evolved in many goby species, allowing juveniles returning from the ocean to penetrate upstream reaches. Past studies of Hawaiian gobioid fishes have identified two functionally different climbing techniques that were characterized by differing kinematics: a style described as 'powerbursting' among species with small juveniles (similar to 1.5 cm body length), and a style described as 'inching-up' among species with large juveniles (similar to 2.2 cm body length). These results suggested a potential size limit to the use of powerburst climbing, and indicated that functional diversity can exist even in extreme environments. In this study, we used standard- and high-speed video to assess kinematic and performance parameters of juvenile and adult Sicydium punctatum from the Caribbean island of Dominica, and compared the results with data previously obtained for two species of climbing gobioid fishes from the Hawaiian Island chain, Sicyopterus stimpsoni and Lentipes concolor. Although nearly as large as the 'inching' climber S. stimpsoni, climbing kinematics of juvenile S. punctatum were similar to those of powerbursting, juvenile L. concolor. Nonetheless, adults of all three species converged on a climbing style similar to that of the inching-up climber S. stimpsoni, still suggesting a size limit for the powerburst climbing style of L. concolor and S. punctatum. Results of this study provide for a refined understanding of how functional diversity can be maintained in extreme environments across a broad geographic range and taxonomic diversity, and shed light on ontogenetic constraints in locomotor function.									4	0	0	4	0	4			0399-0974			WOS:000303949700009

While most of the research and development efforts have been on fullerenes, carbon nanotubes, and graphene sheets, carbon nanoparticles (which are often considered as impurities or unwanted complications in the other carbon nanomaterials) have recently emerged as a unique class of highly fluorescent nano-dots. However, little or no attention has been paid to potential uses of carbon nanoparticles as chromophores in photochemical reactions or for photon harvesting and photoconversion in general. In the study reported herein we demonstrate the chromophore-equivalent functions of aqueous-suspended small carbon nanoparticles in harvesting visible photons for the reductive coating of the nanoparticles with silver and gold and, as a result, the preparation of unique carbonnoble-metal coreshell nanostructures.									18	3	0	1	0	20			1439-4235			WOS:000298354900019	21997901

Among these, the phylum Arthropoda alone represents 1,242,040 species, or about 80% of the total. The most successful group, the Insecta (1,020,007 species), accounts for about 66% of all animals. The most successful insect order, Coleoptera (387,100 species), represents about 38% of all species in 39 insect orders. Another major group in Arthropoda is the class Arachnida (112,201 species), which is dominated by the mites and ticks (Acari 54,617 species) and spiders (43,579 species). Other highly diverse arthropod groups include Crustacea (66,914 species), Trilobitomorpha (19,606 species) and Myriapoda (11,885 species). The phylum Mollusca (117,358 species) is more diverse than other successful invertebrate phyla Platyhelminthes (29,285 species), Nematoda (24,783 species), Echinodermata (20,509 species), Annelida (17,210 species) and Bryozoa (10,941 species). The phylum Craniata, including the vertebrates, represents 64,832 species (for Recent taxa, except for amphibians): among these 7,694 described species of amphibians, 31,958 species of "fish" and 5,750 species of mammals.									757	2	2	739	28	783			1175-5326	1175-5334		WOS:000209467300001	26146682

Unlike other biological methods for NP synthesis, the uniqueness of our method lies in its fast synthesis rates (similar to 7 min for AuNPs) and the ability to tune the nanoparticle size (and subsequently their catalytic activity) via the extract concentration used in the experiment. The phenolic glycosides and reducing sugars present in the extract are largely responsible for the rapid reduction rates of Au3+ ions to AuNPs. Efficient reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) to 4-aminophenol (4-AP) in the presence of AuNPs (or AgNPs) and NaBH4 was observed and was found to depend upon the nanoparticle size or the stem extract concentration used for synthesis.									174	3	0	29	0	175			0743-7463			WOS:000298118500066	22026721

The NEOWISE survey detected NEOs the same way whether they were previously known or not, subject to the availability of ground-based follow-up observations, resulting in the discovery of more than 130 new NEOs. The survey's uniform sensitivity, observing cadence, and image quality have permitted extrapolation of the 428 near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) detected by NEOWISE during the fully cryogenic portion of the WISE mission to the larger population. We find that there are 981 +/- 19 NEAs larger than 1 km and 20,500 +/- 3000 NEAs larger than 100 m. We show that the Spaceguard goal of detecting 90% of all 1 km NEAs has been met, and that the cumulative size distribution is best represented by a broken power law with a slope of 1.32 +/- 0.14 below 1.5 km. This power-law slope produces similar to 13,200 +/- 1900 NEAs with D > 140 m. Although previous studies predict another break in the cumulative size distribution below D similar to 50-100 m, resulting in an increase in the number of NEOs in this size range and smaller, we did not detect enough objects to comment on this increase. The overall number for the NEA population between 100 and 1000 m is lower than previous estimates. The numbers of near-Earth comets and potentially hazardous NEOs will be the subject of future work.									96	0	0	3	0	96			0004-637X			WOS:000298178400058		
J	Jin, Yan; Wang, Mu; Lin, Songyi; Guo, Yang; Liu, Jingbo; Yin, Yongguang				Lin, Song-Y i /A-1778-2012				Optimization of extraction parameters for trehalose from beer waste brewing yeast treated by high-intensity pulsed electric fields (PEF)								AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY				10	82			19144	19152		10.5897/AJB11.2687			DEC 19 2011	2011	High-intensity pulsed electric fields (PEF) was applied to treat beer waste brewing yeasts (BWBY) to improve the permeability of yeast cell membrane in order to extract trehalose. Several independent variables such as pH (3 to 7), electric field strength (0 to 50 kV/cm), pulse numbers (0 to 10) and liquid-solid ratio (20: 1 to 60: 1) were investigated. The optimal parameters were obtained by one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) experiment and quadratic regression orthogonal design. The results showed that under the conditions of electric fields intensity of 19.97 kV/cm, pulse number of 6, and liquid-solid ratio of 30: 1, the extraction rate of trehalose could reach 2.635%. In addition, the extraction efficiency of trehalose treated by PEF was compared with other two trehalose extraction methods, example microwave and ultrasound, and the efficiency of PEF was found to be 103.15 mu g/s; it was 15.96 times higher than microwave and 34.08 times higher than ultrasound. This demonstrated that the PEF could be regarded as a promising technique for bio-material extraction.									16	0	0	14	0	16			1684-5315			WOS:000298560900027

Antibody-directed targeting of lysostaphin adsorbed onto polylactide nanoparticles increases its antimicrobial activity against S. aureus in vitro								NANOTECHNOLOGY				22	50					505103	10.1088/0957-4484/22/50/505103			DEC 16 2011	2011	The objective of this paper was to study the effect of antibody-directed targeting of S. aureus by comparing the activities of lysostaphin conjugated to biodegradable polylactide nanoparticles (NPs) in the presence and in the absence of co-immobilized anti-S. aureus antibody. Lysostaphin-antibody-NP conjugates were synthesized through physical adsorption at different enzyme:antibody:NP ratios. The synthesized enzyme-NP conjugates were characterized by means of dynamic light scattering and zeta potential analysis, and the total protein binding yield on the NPs was characterized using Alexa Fluor 350 and 594 dyes for the S. aureus antibody and lysostaphin respectively. We observed enhanced antimicrobial activity for both enzyme-coated and enzyme-antibody-coated NPs for lysostaphin coatings corresponding to similar to 40% of the initial monolayer and higher compared to the free enzyme case (p < 0.05). At the highest antibody coating concentration, bacterial lysis rates for antibody-coated samples were significantly higher than for lysostaphin-coated samples lacking the antibody (p < 0.05). Such enzyme-NP conjugates thus have the potential for becoming novel therapeutic agents for treating antibiotic-resistant S. aureus infections.									5	0	0	3	0	5			0957-4484			WOS:000298154200003	22107797	
J	Kornev, Konstantin G.								Electrospinning: Distribution of charges in liquid jets								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS				110	12					124910	10.1063/1.3671629			DEC 15 2011	2011	An analysis of the radial distribution of charges in liquid jets is presented. Two cases where considered: (1) when the charges are uniformly distributed through the jet cross-section but are allowed to concentrate at the jet surface with time; (2) when the charges reach a steady state where the Coulomb repulsion and Brownian mixing are counterbalanced keeping the charges inside the jet. Using the first model, we showed that the charge adsorption in nonpolar fluids occurs much faster than that in polar fluids. This provides the basis for the consideration of the second model applicable for polar liquids. We examined this case and found that a steady state does exist, but the concentration of charges is limited from above by a critical concentration inversely proportional to the square of the jet radius. It was shown that above this critical concentration, the charges should accumulate at the jet surface producing an infinitely large surface charge. Using this analysis, we suggest the classification of different regimes of electrospinning when the jets are mostly carrying the volume or surface charges. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

Use of gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane as a terminal electron acceptor by an anaerobic enrichment culture								JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS				197				204	210		10.1016/j.jhazmat.2011.09.080			DEC 15 2011	2011	The use of gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) as a terminal electron acceptor via organohalide respiration was demonstrated for the first time with an enrichment culture grown in a sulfate-free HEPES-buffered anaerobic mineral salts medium. The enrichment culture was initially developed with soil and ground-water from an industrial site contaminated with HCH isomers, chlorinated benzenes, and chlorinated ethenes. When hydrogen served as the electron donor, 79-90% of the electron equivalents from hydrogen were used by the enrichment culture for reductive dechlorination of the gamma-HCH, which was provided at a saturation concentration of approximately 10 mg/L Benzene and chlorobenzene were the only volatile transformation products detected, accounting for 25% and 75% of the gamma-HCH consumed (on a molar basis), respectively. The enrichment culture remained active with only hydrogen as the electron donor and gamma-HCH as the electron acceptor through several transfers to fresh mineral salts medium for more than one year. Addition of vancomycin to the culture significantly slowed the rate of gamma-HCH dechlorination, suggesting that a Gram-positive organism is responsible for the reduction of gamma-HCH. Analysis of the gamma-HCH dechlorinating enrichment culture did not detect any known chlororespiring genera, including Dehalobacter. In bicarbonate-buffered medium, reductive dechlorination of gamma-HCH was accompanied by significant levels of acetogenesis as well as methanogenesis. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

To fabricate the electrodes, vertically standing gold nanopillars on gold films deposited on glass substrates were first formed. The nanopillars along with the underlying film were then patterned into electrodes (in a three-electrode design) and the electrodes were then enclosed in a PDMS chamber to form a fluidic sensor device. Of the three electrodes, one was used as enzyme electrode after functionalization with an enzyme (i.e. glucose oxidase) and the other two were used as working and counter electrodes, respectively. The performance of this fluidic glucose sensor was evaluated by measuring amperometric currents at various glucose concentrations. The nanopillar modified glucose sensor exhibited linear behavior with a sensitivity value as high as 35.9 mu A cm(-2) mM(-1) in a concentration range from 0.25 to 2.5 mM. In comparison with a fluidic glucose sensor having only flat electrodes, the detection sensitivity for the sensor with nanopillar modified electrodes was five times higher. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This has important implications for disinfection byproduct (DBP) formation because the reactions of chlorine and monochloramine (NH(2)Cl) with natural organic matter (NOM) are not the same. In this study, iodinated trihalomethane (I-THM) formation from preformed NH(2)Cl and prechlorination (at two chlorine doses and contact times) followed by ammonia addition was compared. A representative bromide/iodide ratio of 10:1 was selected and four bromide/iodide levels (ambient, 50/5 or 100/10, 200/20, and 800/80 [mu g/L/mu g/L]) were evaluated. The results showed that I-THM formation was generally lower for prechlorination as compared to preformed NH(2)Cl due to the oxidation of iodide to iodate by chlorine. However, while prechlorination minimized iodoform (CHI(3)) formation, prechlorination sometimes formed more I-THMs as compared to preformed NH(2)Cl due to a large increase in the formation of brominated I-THM species, which were formed at much smaller amounts from preformed NH(2)Cl. I-THM concentrations and speciation for the two chloramination scenarios (i.e., preformed NH(2)Cl vs prechlorination followed by ammonia) depended on chlorine dose, contact time, bromide/iodide concentration, and NOM characteristics of the source water (SUVA(234)).									34	0	0	31	0	34			0013-936X			WOS:000298118300025	22050596

Development of an automated algorithm for tracking and quantifying Barnacle cyprid settlement behavior								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY				410				21	28		10.1016/j.jembe.2011.10.001			DEC 15 2011	2011	Research focused on the development of environmentally benign antifouling technologies, novel coatings, and surfaces requires new tools for quickly and accurately evaluating these materials. Barnacle cyprid settlement assays are indispensable for estimating the fouling management potential of a coating. As coating technologies evolve to include topographies, surface active chemistries, and ligands, relying on settlement assays alone will not be enough. Understanding larval interactions and behavior with the coatings in real time is important for predicting antifouling efficacy of the coating and in turn its effects on the larvae. Manually quantifying cyprid-surface interactions from a video sequence can be laborious, highly subjective, and not amenable to high-throughput workflow requirements. Here we describe development of an automated tracking algorithm for analyzing the settlement behavior of Balanus amphitrite cyprid larvae with the aid of a lateral-view microscope equipped with a video camera. The automated algorithm uses elliptical shape models for detecting the position and orientation of larvae in the field of view and a Kalman filter based approach to automatically track the motion of the larvae over many hours of video. Behavioral heuristics are used to analyze and qualify the interaction between larvae and the surfaces. The algorithm, in an unoptimized MATLAB implementation, processes images at 11 frames per second at low median errors of 2.3 pixels and 8 degrees for position and orientation of the cyprid respectively. The results support the use of computer vision techniques in inference and analysis of marine invertebrate larval settlement behavior. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Site-specific irrigation applies irrigation water to match the needs of individual management zones within a field, significantly reducing water consumption, runoff, and nutrient leaching in ground water. Remote sensing for real-time and continuous soil moisture measurements at specific depths is essential for success of site-specific irrigation system.The overall objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility of utilizing a GPS-based sensor technology to determine site-specific information such as the soil moisture condition by recording the GPS signal reflected from the earth's surface. A modified GPS Delay Mapping Receiver (DMR) tracks and measures the direct, line-of-sight, Right-Hand-Circularly Polarized signal of a GPS satellite. It also simultaneously measures the delayed, earth-reflected, near-specular, Left-Hand-Circularly Polarized GPS signal. These measurements can be used to estimate the surface scattering coefficient and path delays between the direct and reflected GPS signals. Over land, scattering coefficients can be used to estimate changes in soil moisture contents. Our results showed that the space-based technology has a great potential for determining soil volumetric moisture contents in the pursuit of site-specific irrigation management. There were strong correlations between the GPS reflectivity measurements and soil moisture contents. The GPS reflectivity increased as the soil moisture contents increased. Careful analysis of the test data showed very conclusively that the sensitivity of L-Band signal (1.575 GHz) to soil moisture contents changed with soil type and sampling depth. The sensitivity decreased with sampling depth in light soils and increased in heavy soils. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

After the Alcalase hydrolysis, egg white protein hydrolysates were purified and identified by LC-MS-MS. Eight identified peptides were further synthesized by the Fmoc solid-phase synthesis. The anti-diabetic activities of these synthetic peptides were assessed using enzymatic inhibitory assays against the alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase. Among the eight peptides, peptide RVPSLM was discovered as a potential alpha-glucosidase inhibitor with an IC(50) value at 23.07 mu mol L(-1). However, it did not exhibit a visible or detectable inhibitory efficiency on the alpha-amylase. These studies indicate the potential of using egg white protein hydrolysates as a functional food product with the anti-diabetic activity. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Relating temperature dependence of atom scattering spectra to surface corrugation								JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER				23	48					484003	10.1088/0953-8984/23/48/484003			DEC 7 2011	2011	It is suggested that a measurement of the temperature dependence of the most probable intensity of energy-resolved atom-surface scattering spectra can reveal the strength of the surface corrugation. To support this conjecture, a classical mechanical theory of atom scattering from a corrugated surface, valid in the weak corrugation limit, is developed. The general result for the scattering probability is expressed in terms of spatial integrals over the impact parameter within a surface unit cell. For the case of a one-dimensional corrugation, approximate expressions for the scattering probability are obtained in terms of analytic closed form expressions. As an indicator of its relation to experimental measurements, calculations using a one-dimensional corrugation model are compared with data for Ar scattering from a molten Ga surface and an approximate value of the corrugation height parameter is extracted.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0953-8984			WOS:000298141600005	22085838

Clinicoimmunopathologic findings in Atlantic bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus with positive cetacean morbillivirus antibody titers								DISEASES OF AQUATIC ORGANISMS				97	2			103	112		10.3354/dao02410			DEC 6 2011	2011	Sera from free-ranging Atlantic bottlenose dolphins Tursiops truncatus inhabiting the Indian River Lagoon (IRL), Florida were tested for antibodies to cetacean morbilliviruses from 2003 to 2007 as part of a multidisciplinary study of individual and population health. A suite of clinico immunopathologic variables were evaluated in morbillivirus-seropositive dolphins (n = 14) and seronegative healthy dolphins (n = 49). Several important differences were found. Serum alkaline phosphatase, creatine phosphokinase, chloride, albumin and albumin/globulin ratios were significantly lower in seropositive dolphins. Innate immunity appeared to be upregulated with significant increases in lysozyme concentration and marginally significant increases in monocytic phagocytosis. Adaptive immunity was also impacted in dolphins with positive morbillivirus antibody titers. Mitogen-induced T lymphocyte proliferation responses were significantly reduced in dolphins with positive morbillivirus antibody titers, and marginally significant decreases were found for absolute numbers of CD4+ lymphocytes. The findings suggest impairment of cell-mediated adaptive immunity, similar to the immunologic pattern reported with acute morbillivirus infection in other species. In contrast, dolphins with positive morbillivirus antibody titers appeared to have at least a partially upregulated humoral immune response with significantly higher levels of gamma globulins than healthy dolphins, which may represent an antibody response to morbillivirus infection or other pathogens. These data suggest that subclinical dolphin morbillivirus infection in IRL dolphins may produce clinicoimmunopathologic perturbations that impact overall health.									6	0	0	5	0	6			0177-5103			WOS:000297702900003	22303627

However, the evolutionary effects of different modes of gene duplication, especially regarding their contributions to genetic novelty or redundancy, have been inadequately explored.Results: In Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa (rice), species that deeply sample botanical diversity and for which expression data are available from a wide range of tissues and physiological conditions, we have compared expression divergence between genes duplicated by six different mechanisms (WGD, tandem, proximal, DNA based transposed, retrotransposed and dispersed), and between positional orthologs. Both neo-functionalization and genetic redundancy appear to contribute to retention of duplicate genes. Genes resulting from WGD and tandem duplications diverge slowest in both coding sequences and gene expression, and contribute most to genetic redundancy, while other duplication modes contribute more to evolutionary novelty. WGD duplicates may more frequently be retained due to dosage amplification, while inferred transposon mediated gene duplications tend to reduce gene expression levels. The extent of expression divergence between duplicates is discernibly related to duplication modes, different WGD events, amino acid divergence, and putatively neutral divergence (time), but the contribution of each factor is heterogeneous among duplication modes. Gene loss may retard inter-species expression divergence. Members of different gene families may have non-random patterns of origin that are similar in Arabidopsis and rice, suggesting the action of pan-taxon principles of molecular evolution.Conclusion: Gene duplication modes differ in contribution to genetic novelty and redundancy, but show some parallels in taxa separated by hundreds of millions of years of evolution.									42	0	0	41	0	42			1932-6203			WOS:000298171400036	22164235

Unfortunately, for many systems, especially those that are large, the available documentation is inadequate. Developers are left with incomplete information concerning the allowable set of call sequences that each class can accommodate. Techniques for reverse engineering this information and presenting it to developers in an intellectually scalable manner are critical.In this paper, we present four contributions to address this challenge. First, we describe a runtime trace collection system for large C++ applications. Second, we present a methodology for reverse engineering interface protocols from collected trace data. Third, we present a scalable, tunable algorithm for generating compact specifications of these protocols. Finally, we present a detailed case study involving the Mozilla Necko library. We consider popular applications in common use constructed using this library. The results are promising both in terms of the performance of the approach and the utility of the identified protocols.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0218-1940	1793-6403		WOS:000302023200003

Unlike previously demonstrated waveguide polarization rotators, our approach relies on the adiabatic mode evolution in a single horizontal slot-waveguide, which results in a simple design and one-mask fabrication process. The structure is designed to rotate the TM-polarized input by 90 degree while be transparent with the TE-polarized input. The fabricated device has a total length of 100 mu m. Transmission spectra show the average polarization extinction ratios of 20 dB and 15 dB for TE and TM -polarized inputs, respectively. Copyright 2011 Author(s).

For years, investigations of the TE properties of these compounds have been hindered by the poor reproducibility in sample preparation. In this work, we used a recently developed simple B2O3 flux method to prepare Mg2Si1-xSnx compounds over a wide composition range (0.1 <= x <= 0.8). The phase structure, microstructure, and TE properties have been investigated. We found that a miscibility gap existed at 0.2 <= x <= 0.45, substantially lower than the more generally accepted values 0.4 <= x <= 0.6, and a low lattice thermal conductivity of 1.4 W.m(-1) . K-1 in undoped Mg2Si0.55Sn0.45, which led to a ZT similar to 0.3 at 550 K. These results constitute a solid basis for investigating further optimization of the Mg2Si1-xSnx-based TE materials via doping and possibly nanostrucuring approaches.									13	1	0	0	0	13			0884-2914			WOS:000299875900005

This study was conducted to determine the effects of a contraceptive vaccine on EGS and its reproductive organ histology. Free-ranging urban EGS were vaccinated with the immunocontraceptive GonaCon (TM). All EGS were >= 6 mo of age as determined by a combination of pelage characteristics and body weights. The vaccine was administered by injection at a dosage rate of 0.4 ml containing 400 mu g of GnRH-mollusk protein conjugate i.m. in the thigh to 33 EGS (17 male [m], 16 female [f]) in trapping session 1 (TS1), 23 (14 m, 9 f) in trapping session 2 (TS2), and 11 (8 m, 3 f) in trapping session 3 (TS3). A sham injection containing 0.4 ml saline-AdjuVac (TM) was given as control to 22 EGS (16 m, 6f) in TS1, 20 (12 m, 8 f) in TS2, and 8 (4 m, 4 f) in TS3. In the last trapping session (TS4), 35 EGS (16 treated, 19 control) were killed for necropsy to evaluate histologic changes in testes and ovaries. Treated EGS males had testicular, prostatic, and epididymal atrophy compared with control EGS males. The tubuli seminiferi and prostatic glandular lumen of treated EGS males were atrophic, and the epididymal lumen contained no sperm cells. No histologic changes were observed in treated EGS females; however, females likely were not collected when changes due to GonaCon (TM) would have been observed. There were no observable histologic differences in the pituitary gland of treated and control EGS. There were no statistically significant differences in either testosterone or progesterone concentrations between control and treated EGS. Although there were no serious side effects to the vaccine, six EGS developed injection site abscesses. GonaCon (TM) may be a potential tool for EGS population control.									3	0	0	3	0	3			1042-7260			WOS:000298440000024	22204069

We show that C-2/(Z circle plus Zi)((l)(-k)) classifies k-l-covers up to isomorphism away from a rather small set. The diagonal action of SL2(Z) on C-2 descends to (C-2/(Z circle plus Zi)((l)(-k)), dz + dw), reflecting the SL2(Z)-action on the family of k-l-surfaces equipped with a translation structure. The moduli space of holonomy free k-l-surfaces is a compact SL2(Z) invariant subspace T-k,l(0) subset of C-2/(Z circle plus Zi)((l)(-k)) containing all k-l-surfaces with a lattice stabilizer with respect to the SL2(Z) action. We calculate the stabilizer, the Veech group, explicitly and represent k-l-covers branched over two points by a generalized class of staircase surfaces. Finally we study SL2(Z)-equivariant translation maps from the Hurwitz space of k-(d-k)-covers to Hurwitz spaces of Z/d-covers branched over two points.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1793-5253			WOS:000299572000007

Predictive process control using a moving radiant actuator								PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART I-JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND CONTROL ENGINEERING				225	I8			1086	1097		10.1177/0959651811406345			DEC 2011	2011	This paper presents a predictive control framework for a class of industrial distributed-parameter processes employing moving radiant actuators. The use of a moving actuator provides additional control options, but it also requires more elaborate control strategies to ensure a desired level of quality for the target process. The proposed predictive control framework is based on a generic one-dimensional (1D) formulation that describes common characteristics of typical radiant source actuated processes. The developed control framework incorporates carefully reduced process models that capture the main features of the processes and a state/parameter estimator activated with a policy that considers the changing radiant input distribution accompanying the moving actuator. The developed model predictive control framework is then demonstrated on a 1D robotic ultraviolet paint curing process. The results show that the predictive control approach provides a better cure process performance than typical static optimization methods.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0959-6518			WOS:000299487300004

Out of a national sample of 1,753 young adults who completed follow-up interviews after participating in the National Survey of Adolescents, 268 homicide survivors and 653 victims of other interpersonal violence were selected for the study. Participants completed structured telephone interviews that covered the loss of a family member or close friend to homicide, violence exposure, and PTSD symptomatology. Findings indicated that 39% of homicide survivors met criteria for all 3 symptom clusters and 30% of homicide survivors met criteria for 2 PTSD clusters (functional impairment was not assessed). Multivariate logistic regression analyses demonstrated that homicide survivors were more likely than victims of other violence to meet criteria for all 3 PTSD symptom clusters (OR = 1.91, p < .05) and 2 symptom clusters (OR = 1.77, p < .05) when demographic characteristics and number of violent events were included in the model. These findings highlight the high prevalence of subthreshold PTSD symptoms among homicide survivors. Results suggest that homicide survivors are at elevated risk for PTSD symptoms in comparison to victims of other interpersonal violence.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0894-9867			WOS:000298581800015	22108895

Sediment transport mechanics upstream of an orifice								JOURNAL OF VISUALIZATION				14	4			315	320		10.1007/s12650-011-0097-7			DEC 2011	2011	Mechanics of sediment transport, maximum scour depth, and scoured volume upstream of a circular orifice was explored under constant head condition. A high-speed camera was used to investigate the sediment transport mechanism. It was found that sediment transport had two distinct phases. In the first phase, the sediment transport was due to excess bed shear stress and occurred within an area that was elliptical in shape, and the mobilized sediment was transported out of the orifice. In the second stage, vortices appear in the area that was scoured during the first phase. The sediment particles were lifted up into the main flow by these vortices, which were then transported out of the orifice by the main flow. The scour depth and scoured volume were found to be dependent on sediment size and head over the orifice.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1343-8875			WOS:000297131800004

COMPARATIVE TOXICITY OF TWO GLYPHOSATE FORMULATIONS (ORIGINAL FORMULATION OF ROUNDUP (R) AND ROUNDUP WEATHERMAX (R)) TO SIX NORTH AMERICAN LARVAL ANURANS								ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY				30	12			2756	2761		10.1002/etc.670			DEC 2011	2011	The toxicity of two glyphosate formulations (the original formulation of Roundup (R) and Roundup WeatherMAX (R)) to six species of North American larval anurans was evaluated by using 96-h static, nonrenewal aqueous exposures. The 96-h median lethal concentration values (LC50) ranged from 1.80 to 4.22 mg acid equivalent (ae)/L and 1.96 to 3.26 mg ae/L for the original formulation of Roundup and Roundup WeatherMAX, respectively. Judged by LC50 values, four species were more sensitive to Roundup WeatherMAX exposures, and two species were more sensitive to the original formulation. Two of six species, Bufo fowleri (p < 0.05, F = 14.89, degrees of freedom [df] = 1) and Rana clamitans (p < 0.05, F = 18.46, df = 1), had significantly different responses to the two formulations tested. Increased sensitivity to Roundup WeatherMAX likely was due to differences in the surfactants or relative amounts of the surfactants in the two formulations. Potency slopes for exposures of the original formulation ranged from 24.3 to 92.5% mortality/mg ae/L. Thresholds ranged from 1.31 to 3.68 mg ae/L, showing an approximately three times difference in the initiation of response among species tested. For exposures of Roundup WeatherMAX, slopes ranged from 49.3 to 84.2% mortality/mg ae/L. Thresholds ranged from 0.83 to 2.68 mg ae/L. Margins of safety derived from a simulated direct overspray were above 1, except for one species in exposures of Roundup WeatherMAX. Laboratory data based on aqueous exposures are conservative because of the lack of environmental ligands; however, these tests provide information regarding the relative toxicity between these two Roundup formulations.

The Essentiality of "Culture" in the Study of Religion and Politics								JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION				50	4			639	653		10.1111/j.1468-5906.2011.01608.x			DEC 2011	2011	This article reviews various theoretical approaches political scientists employ in the analysis of religion and politics and posits culture as a conceptual bridge between competing approaches. After coming to the study of religion slowly in comparison with other social science disciplines, political science finally has a theoretically diverse and thriving religion and politics subfield. However, political scientists contributions to the social scientific study of religion are hampered by a lack of agreement about whether endogenous or exogenous theoretical approaches ought to dominate our scholarship. I assert that the concept of cultureand more specifically, subculturemight help create more connections across theoretical research traditions. I emphasize how the concept of religion-based subculture is inherent in psychological, social psychological, social movement, and contextual approaches to religion and politics scholarship, and I explore these theoretical connections using the example of religion-based us versus them discourses in contemporary American politics.									6	0	0	0	2	8			0021-8294			WOS:000297912300002

Design: Two postdeployment time points were used in combination with structural equation modeling to examine the relative strength of two possible directions of prediction: insomnia as a predictor of psychological symptoms, and psychological symptoms as a predictor of insomnia. Participants were active duty soldiers (N = 659) in a brigade combat team who were assessed 4 months after their return from a 12-month deployment to Iraq, and then again eight months later. Results: Although both insomnia and psychological symptoms were associated at both time periods and across time periods, insomnia at 4 months postdeployment was a significant predictor of change in depression and PTSD symptoms at 12 months postdeployment, whereas depression and PTSD symptoms at 4 months postdeployment were not significant predictors of change in insomnia at 12 months postdeployment. Conclusions: Results support the role of insomnia in the development of additional psychological problems and highlight the clinical implications for combat veterans, to include the importance of longitudinal assessment and monitoring of sleep disturbances, and the need for early intervention.

Forecasting errors can be quantified and controlled by deploying statistical inference procedures, combined with an experimental campaign to improve the fidelity of a simulation model that is developed based on sound physics or engineering principles. This manuscript illustrates that the number of experiments required to reduce the forecasting errors to desired levels can be determined by focusing on the proposed forecasting metric.

Developmental profile of storage reserve accumulation in soybean somatic embryos								IN VITRO CELLULAR & DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY-PLANT				47	6			725	733		10.1007/s11627-011-9375-2			DEC 2011	2011	Soybean somatic embryos were developed as a model for investigating the developmental relationships of lipid biosynthesis and accumulation in this important crop. Batch cultures of embryos grown for 8 wk in liquid culture medium exhibited typical sigmoidal growth kinetics as they passed through characteristic globular, heart, torpedo, and cotyledon stages. Exponential growth occurred for the first 4 wk in culture with net growth terminating when total embryo fresh weight per culture flask reached a maximum of 4-4.5 g at 6 wk. This was followed by a slight decrease in embryo fresh weight (FW) and the onset of apparent tissue senescence as judged by yellowing and browning of embryos. On a FW basis, embryos accumulated up to 4% protein, 2.5% soluble sugars, 1.9% starch, and 1.5% lipid relatively early in development. Levels decreased to 0.8% protein, 0.5% soluble sugars, 0.03% starch, and 0.09% lipid at the end of the culture period. On a mass percent basis, lipid extracts were comprised of approximately 80-90% polar lipid early in embryo development. This shifted to 56% storage lipid (triacylglycerol) and 44% polar lipid after 4-5 wk in culture and then reverted back to 91% and 9% polar vs. storage lipid, respectively, by the end of the 8-wk culture period. On the average, polar and storage lipid fractions were comprised of 24% palmitic acid, 7% stearic acid, 8% oleic acid, 36% linoleic acid, and 26% linolenic acid. However, the amounts of linoleic and linolenic acids declined sharply during embryo senescence at the end of the culture period, with corresponding increases in the combined amounts of palmitic and stearic acids. This is the first report that documents the progress of storage reserve accumulation in soybean somatic embryos in relation to their continuous growth in liquid batch cultures.									4	0	0	4	0	4			1054-5476	1475-2689		WOS:000298298700011

The space group of these compounds was re-determined and confirmed to be P31c instead of the reported P6(3)mc. The lattice parameters a and c range from 6.26279(2) angstrom to 6.31181(6) angstrom, and from 10.22468(6) angstrom to 10.24446(15) angstrom for R Lu to Dy, respectively. The crystal structure of BaRCo4O7 is built up from Kagome sheets of CoO4 tetrahedra, linked by triangular layers of CoO4 tetrahedra. The values of figure of merit (ZT) of the BaRCo4O7 samples were determined to be around 0.02 at 800 K. X-ray diffraction patterns of these samples have been determined and submitted to the Powder Diffraction File. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

J	Salandro, Wesley A.; Bunget, Cristina J.; Mears, Laine								Several Factors Affecting the Electroplastic Effect During an Electrically-Assisted Forming Process								JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME				133	6					064503	10.1115/1.4004950			DEC 2011	2011	Recent development of electrically-assisted manufacturing (EAM) processes proved the advantages of using the electric current, mainly related with the decrease in the mechanical forming load and improvement in the formability. From EAM experiments, it has been determined that a portion of the applied electrical power contributes toward these forming benefits and the rest is dissipated into heat, defined as the electroplastic effect. The objective of this work is to experimentally investigate several factors that affect the electroplastic effect and the efficiency of the applied electricity. Specifically, the effects of various levels of cold work and contact force are explored on both Grade 2 and Grade 5 Titanium alloys. Thermal and mechanical data prove that these factors notably affect the efficiency of the applied electricity during an electrically-assisted forming (EAF) process.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1087-1357			WOS:000298542600034

Results revealed significant person-level variation in attitude importance, extremity, and ambivalence across attitude objects. Study 1 found the personality variable of need to evaluate (NE) predicted extremity across attitude objects, and finding meaning in life (ML) was predictive of importance across objects. Study 2 revealed that neuroticism and state anxiety were significant predictors of ambivalence across attitude objects. Finally, the NE, the Need for Cognition, and Openness to Experience each moderated the within-person relationship between extremity and ambivalence across objects, with higher values on the individual difference variables being related to stronger within-person relationships. Implications for research on attitude strength and the relationships between personality variables and attitudes are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

However, the level of spatial control required cannot be obtained through conventional cell processing techniques (e.g., pipetting of or even ink-jetting cells), as they lack the precision, reproducibility, and speed required for the rapid fabrication of idealized engineered constructs. Laser direct-write approaches (e.g., matrix-assisted pulsed-laser evaporation direct-write [MAPLE DW]), previously employed for the rapid prototyping of electronics, have shown reliable patterning of biomaterials with a spatial resolution of +/-5 mu m. Moreover, recent advances allow the rapid, precise deposition of viable mammalian cells and pluripotent stem cells on well-defined substrates, enabling the laser direct-writing platform to advance manipulation of the in vitro cellular microenvironment (e.g., the stem cell niche). Herein, we review the mechanisms and recent advances demonstrating the versatility and biofabrication potential of one particular laser-based technique, MAPLE DW.									29	0	0	11	0	29			0883-7694	1938-1425		WOS:000299231900026

Kohn, Matthew/A-2562-2012				Isotopic evaluation of ocean circulation in the Late Cretaceous North American seaway								NATURE GEOSCIENCE				4	12			852	855		10.1038/NGEO1312			DEC 2011	2011	During the mid- and Late Cretaceous period, North America was split by the north-south oriented Western Interior Seaway. Its role in creating and maintaining Late Cretaceous global greenhouse conditions remains unclear. Different palaeoceanographic reconstructions portray diverse circulation patterns(1-3). The southward extent of relatively cool, low-salinity, low-delta(18)O surface waters critically distinguishes among these models, but past studies of invertebrates could not independently assess water temperature and isotopic compositions. Here we present oxygen isotopes in biophosphate from coeval marine turtle and fish fossils from western Kansas, representing the east central seaway, and from the Mississippi embayment, representing the marginal Tethys Ocean. Our analyses yield precise seawater isotopic values and geographic temperature differences during the main transition from the Coniacian to the early Campanian age (87-82 Myr), and indicate that the seaway oxygen isotope value and salinity were 2 parts per thousand and 3 parts per thousand lower, respectively, than in the marginal Tethys Ocean. We infer that the influence of northern freshwater probably reached as far south as Kansas. Our revised values imply relatively large temperature differences between the Mississippi embayment and central seaway, explain the documented regional latitudinal palaeo-biogeographic zonation(4,5) and support models with relatively little inflow of surface waters from the Tethys Ocean to the Western Interior Seaway(2,3).									11	0	0	4	0	11			1752-0894			WOS:000298153200015

Impact of increasing gasoline prices on tourism travel patterns to a state park								TOURISM ECONOMICS				17	6			1311	1324		10.5367/te.2011.0093			DEC 2011	2011	Because tourism and outdoor recreation are highly travel dependent, they are influenced by gasoline prices. Unstable and increasing gasoline prices can affect travel participation, and behavioural adaptations are likely to occur. This paper examines the impact of higher gasoline prices on park visitation and investigates the degree to which certain behavioural and socio-demographic variables mediate the direct impact of gasoline prices on travel decisions to visit a park. The study findings revealed that the influence of increasing gasoline prices on travel decisions was progressively intensified and mitigated by several behavioural variables.									6	0	0	3	0	7			1354-8166			WOS:000298576500009

Effect of pilot hole diameter and tapping on insertion torque and axial pullout strength of 4.0-mm cancellous bone screws								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH				72	12			1660	1665					DEC 2011	2011	Objective-To evaluate the effects of pilot hole diameter and tapping on insertion torque and axial pullout strength of 4.0-mm cancellous bone screws in a synthetic canine cancellous bone substitute.Sample-75 synthetic cancellous bone blocks (15 blocks/group).Procedures-For groups 1 through 5, screw size-pilot hole diameter combinations were 3.5-2.5 mm (cortical screws), 4.0-2.5 mm, 4.0-2.5 mm, 4.0-2.0 mm, and 4.0-2.0 mm, respectively. Holes were tapped in groups 1, 2, and 4 only (tap diameter, 3.5, 4.0, and 4.0 mm, respectively). One 70-mm-long screw was inserted into each block; in a servohydraulic materials testing machine, the screw was extracted (rate, 5 mm/min) until failure. Mean group values of maximum insertion torque, axial pullout strength, yield strength, and stiffness were determined.Results-Mean maximum insertion torque differed significantly among the 5 groups; the group 5 value was greatest, followed by group 3, 4, 2, and 1 values. Group 3, 4, and 5 axial pullout strengths were similar and significantly greater than the group 2 value; all values were significantly greater than that for group 1. Group 5 and 4 yield strengths were similar and significantly greater than the group 3, 2, and 1 values. Stiffness in group 3 was similar to group 4 and 2 values but significantly greater than the group 5 value; all values were significantly greater than that for group 1.Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-These synthetic cancellous bone model findings suggested that tapping a 2.0-mm-diameter pilot hole when placing a 4.0-mm screw is the optimal insertion technique.

The genetically modified Bt toxins Cry1AbMod and Cry1AcMod were designed to counter insect resistance to native Bt toxins Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac(7). Previous results suggested that the modified toxins would be effective only if resistance was linked with mutations in genes encoding toxin-binding cadherin proteins(7). Here we report evidence from five major crop pests refuting this hypothesis. Relative to native toxins, the potency of modified toxins was >350-fold higher against resistant strains of Plutella xylostella and Ostrinia nubilalis in which resistance was not linked with cadherin mutations. Conversely, the modified toxins provided little or no advantage against some resistant strains of three other pests with altered cadherin. Independent of the presence of cadherin mutations, the relative potency of the modified toxins was generally higher against the most resistant strains.									56	6	0	53	0	61			1087-0156			WOS:000298038700024	21983521

Unfortunately, the metaanalytic values estimates for validity and group differences (i.e., rho and delta, respectively) used in such matrices often vary in the extent to which they are affected by artifacts and how accurately the values capture the underlying constructs and the appropriate population. We investigate how such concerns might influence conclusions concerning key issues such as prediction of job performance and adverse impact of selection procedures, as well as noting wider applications of these issues. We also start the process of building a better matrix upon which to base many such simulations and analyses in staffing research. Finally, we offer guidelines to help researchers/practitioners better model human resources processes, and we suggest ways that researchers in a variety of areas can better assemble meta-analytic matrices.									15	0	0	0	1	16			0031-5826			WOS:000297582000003

The first round of the pK(a)-cooperative, which challenged computational labs to carry out blind predictions against pK(a)s experimentally determined in the laboratory of Bertrand Garcia-Moreno, was completed and results discussed at the Telluride meeting (July 6-10, 2009). This article serves as an introduction to the reports submitted by the blind prediction participants that will be published in a special issue of PROTEINS: Structure, Function and Bioinformatics. Here, we briefly outline existing approaches for pK(a) calculations, emphasizing methods that were used by the participants in calculating the blind pK(a) values in the first round of the cooperative. We then point out some of the difficulties encountered by the participating groups in making their blind predictions, and finally try to provide some insights for future developments aimed at improving the accuracy of pK(a) calculations.

Frequently, however, the ionization does not involve significant structural changes and the dominating effects are purely electrostatic in origin allowing accurate predictions to be made based on the electrostatic energy difference between ionized and neutral forms alone using a static structure and the subtle structural changes be accounted by using dielectric constant larger than two. On another hand, if the change of the charge state is accompanied by a large structural reorganization of the target protein, then the relevant conformational changes have to be explicitly taken into account in the pK(a) calculations. Here we report a hybrid approach that first predicts the titratable groups whose ionization is expected to cause large conformational changes, termed 'problematic'' residues, and then applies a special protocol on them, while the rest of the pK(a)s are predicted with rigid backbone approach as implemented in multi-conformation continuum electrostatics (MCCE) method. The backbone representative conformations for "problematic'' groups are generated with either molecular dynamics simulations with charged and uncharged amino acid or with ab-initio local segment modeling. The corresponding ensembles are then used to calculate the titration curves of the "problematic'' residues and then the results are averaged to obtain the corresponding pK(a).

Structural engineers, architects and builders rely upon published design values in catalogs, software, and websites provided by individual manufacturers to aid in the appropriate selection of connectors once the determination has been made for the required capacities of the connector. To date, the state-of-the-practice for dealing with multi-axis loads in these connectors is to use a linear unity equation based on uni-axis design values. However, 110 significant validation of this practice is to be found in the literature. This study experimentally examines three very common connector types under both bi-axis and tri-axis loads and helps to understand the behavior of such connectors under multi-axis loads. After testing over 350 connections and performing detailed analyses, the currently used design equation is found to be inefficient (has the least usable design space compared to other considered design equations) and overly conservative. Based on the criteria of efficiency, performance and safety, a design space using either the linear unity equation or by simply taking a 25% reduction on all allowable loads is proposed. The proposed design space for the three types of connectors is shown to have a high level of safety and adequate performance while providing up to 2.5 times the usable design space as compared with the current practice.

J	Chen, Xing; Huang, Kama; Xu, Xiao-Bang								A Novel Planar Slot Array Antenna With Omnidirectional Pattern								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION				59	12			4853	4857		10.1109/TAP.2011.2165481			DEC 2011	2011	A novel planar slot array antenna with omnidirectional radiation pattern in the horizontal plane is proposed. The antenna has a simple structure based on a stripline. Its fabrication employs a low-cost and accurate planar printed technique. A series of rectangular-shaped loop slots are etched on two parallel ground planes, and act as radiators. The basic principle of operation of the antenna is discussed in this study. An antenna with eight back-to-back slots is designed by employing the genetic algorithm (GA) implemented on a cluster system to achieve good omnidirectional radiation characteristics. A prototype antenna is fabricated and measured. The measurement results agree with the simulation data and show that this antenna possesses encouraging features. For example, at the working frequency of 5.8 GHz, it has a well-formed omnidirectional pattern with maximum gain variation less than 0.5 dB in the horizontal plane, a high gain level of 10 dBi, side lobes 10 dB below the main lobe and no beam squint. Meanwhile, this antenna achieves an impedance bandwidth of 4.6% of the center frequency (5.68-5.95 GHz) for S(11) < -10 dB and exhibits stable omnidirectional performance over the impedance bandwidth.									12	0	0	0	0	12			0018-926X			WOS:000297585600053		
J	Grujicic, M.; Pandurangan, B.; Hariharan, A.								Comparative Discrete-Particle Versus Continuum-Based Computational Investigation of Soil Response to Impulse Loading								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				20	9			1520	1535		10.1007/s11665-011-9844-0			DEC 2011	2011	Two representative soil models are compared and contrasted within two transient nonlinear dynamics computational analyses. The first soil model is representative of a discrete-particle group of models, while the other is a typical continuum-type consolidated-soil model. The two computational analyses involved: (a) the case of a soil slug impacting a rigid flat surface and (b) the case of detonation of a mine shallow buried in soil and the interaction of the resulting gaseous detonation products, mine fragments, and soil ejecta with a plate-like deformable steel target. The results obtained show that the use of the computationally more expensive particle mechanics-based soil models is fully justified only in the case of loose (low-density) soil. In addition, the magnitude of the particle-to-particle coefficient of restitution has been found to have a second-order effect on the extent of momentum transferred from the moving soil to the target and that it may be substantially different from its effective counterpart for the entire loose-soil agglomerate.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1059-9495			WOS:000297591700005

Another look at the theoretical dichotomy of opportunity versus grievance								REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL STUDIES				37	5			2627	2650		10.1017/S026021051100012X			DEC 2011	2011	The purpose of this article is to review major theoretical arguments with regard to the causes of civil war and identify problems associated with the conceptual juxtaposition of opportunity versus grievance that predominates in the field. While they are critical aspects of conflict processes, perception of opportunity and grievance as two mutually competing explanations or separate categories ultimately can limit, rather than facilitate, our understanding of civil conflicts. For example, we show that not all motives can be designated easily as deriving from one or the other. In addition, the existing dichotomous framework masks other important questions about the way that collective action is achieved in some circumstances and not others or the way that some factors seem to generate grievances at one stage, perhaps, but then an opportunity at another or vice versa. Thus the priority should be to develop an integrated, comprehensive approach that can account for fundamental aspects of complex conflict processes. We conclude by providing suggestions for future research on civil conflict.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0260-2105			WOS:000297785100031

Jaw muscle fiber type distribution in Hawaiian gobioid stream fishes: histochemical correlations with feeding ecology and behavior								ZOOLOGY				114	6			340	347		10.1016/j.zool.2011.05.005			DEC 2011	2011	Differences in fiber type distribution in the axial muscles of Hawaiian gobioid stream fishes have previously been linked to differences in locomotor performance, behavior, and diet across species. Using ATPase assays, we examined fiber types of the jaw opening sternohyoideus muscle across five species, as well as fiber types of three jaw closing muscles (adductor mandibulae A1, A2, and A3). The jaw muscles of some species of Hawaiian stream gobies contained substantial red fiber components. Some jaw muscles always had greater proportions of white muscle fibers than other jaw muscles, independent of species. In addition, comparing across species, the dietary generalists (Awaous guamensis and Stenogobius hawaiiensis) had a lower proportion of white muscle fibers in all jaw muscles than the dietary specialists (Lentipes concolor. Sicyopterus stimpsoni. and Eleotris sandwicensis). Among Hawaiian stream gobies, generalist diets may favor a wider range of muscle performance, provided by a mix of white and red muscle fibers, than is typical of dietary specialists, which may have a higher proportion of fast-twitch white fibers in jaw muscles to help meet the demands of rapid predatory strikes or feeding in fast-flowing habitats.

Larval exposure to Francisella tularensis LVS affects fitness of the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus								FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY				78	3			520	530		10.1111/j.1574-6941.2011.01182.x			DEC 2011	2011	Francisella tularensis is an environmental bacterium capable of infecting a wide spectrum of species from mammals and birds to reptiles. It has been demonstrated that F. tularensis can invade and survive within protozoa, but an association with aquatic insects has not been thoroughly investigated. We examined the interaction of F. tularensis LVS biofilms and Culex quinquefasciatus larvae to determine the effects on larvae and adults. Our results demonstrate that F. tularensis LVS can form and persist as biofilms in natural water and that the mosquito larvae of C. quinquefasciatus readily feed on biofilm and planktonic forms of F. tularensis LVS. Larvae raised in both bacteria-only cultures suffered significant delays in pupation. Adults resulting from larvae continuously exposed to the bacteria had significantly reduced wing lengths in males and fecundity of both sexes. The bacteria may be exerting these effects through localization and persistence within the midgut and Malpighian tubule cells of the larvae. The study of oral acquisition of pathogens by insect larvae can significantly contribute to the study of environmental persistence of pathogens. We show that oral uptake of F. tularensis LVS by C. quinquefasciatus larvae results in not only larval effects but also has effects on adult mosquitoes. These effects are important in understanding both the ecology of tularemia as well as bacterial interactions with aquatic invertebrates.									6	1	0	6	0	7			0168-6496			WOS:000297156300010	22066999

Starting from describing the manufacturing process, we identify typical scheduling problems found in semiconductor manufacturing systems. We describe batch scheduling problems, parallel machine scheduling problems, job shop scheduling problems, scheduling problems with auxiliary resources, multiple orders per job scheduling problems, and scheduling problems related to cluster tools. We also present important solution techniques that are used to solve these scheduling problems by means of specific examples, and report on known implementations. Finally, we summarize some of the challenges in scheduling semiconductor manufacturing operations.									71	2	0	0	0	73			1094-6136			WOS:000297363700005

This study demonstrates a continuous-flow electrokinetic separation of particles and cells in a serpentine microchannel through curvature-induced dielectrophoresis. The separation arises from the particle size-dependent cross-stream dielectrophoretic deflection that is generated by the inherent electric field gradients within channel turns. Through the use of a sheath flow to focus the particle mixture, we implement a continuous separation of 1 and 5 mu m polystyrene particles in a serpentine microchannel under a 15 kV/m DC electric field. The effects of the applied DC voltages and the serpentine length on the separation performance are examined. The same channel is also demonstrated to separate yeast cells (range in diameter between 4 and 8 mu m) from 3 mu m particles under an electric field as low as 10 kV/m. The observed focusing and separation processes for particles and cells in the serpentine microchannel are reasonably predicted by a numerical model.									24	4	0	8	0	26			1613-4982			WOS:000297366700009		
J	Ayyagari, Ramakrishna; Grover, Varun; Purvis, Russell								TECHNOSTRESS: TECHNOLOGICAL ANTECEDENTS AND IMPLICATIONS								MIS QUARTERLY				35	4			831	858					DEC 2011	2011	With the proliferation and ubiquity of information and communication technologies (ICTs), it is becoming imperative for individuals to constantly engage with these technologies in order to get work accomplished. Academic literature, popular press, and anecdotal evidence suggest that ICTs are responsible for increased stress levels in individuals (known as technostress). However, despite the influence of stress on health costs and productivity, it is not very clear which characteristics of ICTs create stress. We draw from IS and stress research to build and test a model of technostress. The person-environment fit model is used as a theoretical lens. The research model proposes that certain technology characteristics-like usability (usefulness, complexity, and reliability), intrusiveness (presenteeism, anonymity), and dynamism (pace of change)-are related to stressors (work overload, role ambiguity, invasion of privacy, work home conflict, and job insecurity). Field data from 661 working professionals was obtained and analyzed. The results clearly suggest the prevalence of technostress and the hypotheses from the model are generally supported. Work overload and role ambiguity are found to be the two most dominant stressors, whereas intrusive technology characteristics are found to be the dominant predictors of stressors. The results open up new avenues for research by highlighting the incidence of technostress in organizations and possible interventions to alleviate it.									71	0	0	0	0	71			0276-7783			WOS:000297236000003

LITHIUM IN THE UPPER CENTAURUS LUPUS AND LOWER CENTAURUS CRUX SUBGROUPS OF SCORPIUS-CENTAURUS								ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL				142	6					180	10.1088/0004-6256/142/6/180			DEC 2011	2011	We utilize spectroscopically derived model atmosphere parameters and the Li I lambda 6104 subordinate line and the lambda 6708 doublet to derive lithium abundances for 12 members of the Upper Centaurus Lupus and Lower Centaurus Crux subgroups of the Scorpius-Centaurus OB Association. The results indicate any intrinsic Li scatter in our 0.9-1.4M(circle dot) stars is limited to similar to 0.15 dex, consistent with the lack of dispersion in >= 1.0M(circle dot) stars in the 100 Myr Pleiades and 30-50 Myr IC 2391 and 2602 clusters. Both ab initio uncertainty estimates and the derived abundances themselves indicate that the lambda 6104 line yields abundances with equivalent or less scatter than is found from the lambda 6708 doublet as a result of lower uncertainties for the subordinate feature, a result of low sensitivity to broadening in the subordinate feature. Because non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) corrections are less susceptible to changes in surface gravity and/or metallicity for the 6104 angstrom line, the subordinate Li feature is preferred for deriving lithium abundances in young Li-rich stellar association stars with T-eff >= 5200 K. At these temperatures, we find no difference between the Li abundances derived from the two Li I lines. For cooler stars, having temperatures at which main-sequence dwarfs show abundance patterns indicating overexcitation and overionization, the lambda 6104-based Li abundances are similar to 0.4 dex lower than those derived from the lambda 6708 doublet. The trends of the abundances from each feature with T-eff suggest that this difference is due to (near)UV photoionization, which in NLTE preferentially ionizes Li atoms in the subordinate 2p state relative to the 2s resonance line state due to opacity effects. Consequently, this overionization of Li in the 2p state, apparently not adequately accounted for in NLTE corrections, weakens the lambda 6104 feature in cooler stars. Accordingly, the lambda 6708-based abundances may give more reliable estimates of the mean Li abundance in cool young stars. Our mean Li abundance, log N(Li) = 3.50 +/- 0.07 is similar to 0.2 dex larger than the meteoritic value. While stellar models suggest that Li depletion of at least 0.4 dex, and possibly much larger, should have occurred in our lowest mass star(s), our Li abundances show no decline with decreasing mass indicative of such depletion.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0004-6256			WOS:000297254500002

The study employed a mixed-method design with a triangulation-convergence model to explore the relationship between authentic literacy tasks and the literacy motivation of elementary students (n = 180), while also seeking to document whether students demonstrated accountability to community, content, and critical thinking during small-group discussions. Data sources included pre- and postintervention scores on the Literacy Motivation Survey, transcriptions of small-group discussions, and transcriptions of interviews with 28 key student informants. Findings integrated across quantitative and qualitative data sources suggest that authentic literacy tasks have the potential to support and sustain students' literacy motivation. Analysis of the discussions revealed that students demonstrated accountability to community, content, and critical thinking. Implications for the use of authentic tasks in literacy instruction, as well as suggestions for future research, are discussed.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0013-5984			WOS:000297140100002

The starting perfluoroalkyl imine CF3-N=CF2 was converted to the perfluoroalkyl amine (CF3)(2)NH by HF. The amine was converted into the carbamoyl fluoride (CF3)(2)NC(O)F via reaction with carbonyl fluoride COF2 in the presence of NaF. The carbamoyl fluoride was subjected to catalytic fluorination with molecular F-2 in the presence of CsF to afford the hypofluorite (CF3)(2)NCF2(OF). The hypofluorite was added to CFCl=CFCl to provide a saturated halocarbon ether. Dechlorination of the ether with zinc in DMSO resulted in the title monomer.

Effects of in ovo injection of carbohydrates on somatic characteristics and liver nutrient profiles of broiler embryos and hatchlings								POULTRY SCIENCE				90	12			2681	2688		10.3382/ps.2011-01532			DEC 1 2011	2011	Effects of the in ovo injection of commercial diluent supplemented with dextrin or with dextrin in combination with various other carbohydrates on the somatic characteristics and liver nutrient profiles of Ross x Ross 708 broiler embryos and chicks were investigated. Results include information concerning the gluconeogenic energy status of the liver before and after hatch. Eggs containing live embryos were injected in the amnion on d 18 of incubation using an automated multiple-egg injector for the delivery of the following carbohydrates dissolved in 0.4 mL of commercial diluent: 1) 6.25% glucose and 18.75% dextrin; 2) 6.25% sucrose and 18.75% dextrin; 3) 6.25% maltose and 18.75% dextrin; and 4) 25% dextrin. Also, a noninjected control and a 0.4-mL diluent-injected control were included. Body weight relative to set egg weight on d 19 of incubation (E19) was increased by the injection of all carbohydrate solutions, and on the day of hatch was increased by the injection of diluent, sucrose and dextrin, and maltose and dextrin solutions. Hatchability of the fertilized eggs, residual yolk sac weight, and liver weight were not affected by any injection treatment; however, as compared with the 0.4 mL diluent-injected group, all of the supplementary carbohydrates, except for the glucose and dextrin combination group, increased liver glycogen and glucose concentrations on E19. Furthermore, all carbohydrates, except for the 25% dextrin treatment, decreased liver fat concentration on E19. From E19 to the day of hatch, liver glycogen concentrations dropped dramatically from an average of 3.2 to 0.6%. Despite treatment differences observed on E19 for liver glycogen, glucose, and fat concentrations, these differences were lost by the day of hatch. Nevertheless, liver glycogen and glucose concentrations were positively correlated on the day of hatch. In conclusion, the in ovo injection of various supplemental carbohydrates dissolved in 0.4 mL of commercial diluent altered the liver nutrient profile of Ross x Ross 708 broiler embryos before hatch. However, the subsequent pattern of energy utilization during the hatching process modified these effects.									9	0	0	9	0	9			0032-5791			WOS:000296956900001	22080004

Survival of artificially inoculated Escherichia coli and Salmonella Typhimurium on the surface of raw poultry products subjected to crust freezing								POULTRY SCIENCE				90	12			2874	2878		10.3382/ps.2011-01640			DEC 1 2011	2011	Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. are ubiquitous in the poultry production environment, and hence, their transmission to poultry products is of concern. Industry has widely used freezing as a strategy to halt pathogen growth, and more recently, crust freezing has been suggested as a means to improve mechanical operations, quality, and safety of poultry products. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of crust freezing on the survival of Escherichia coli and Salmonella Typhimurium that were artificially inoculated on the surface of raw poultry products with or without adhering skin. Ampicillin-resistant (AR) E. coli JM 109 and nalidixic acid-resistant (NAR) Salmonella Typhimurium were used in the experiments. A set of cultures was subjected to cold-shock stress by storage at 4 degrees C for 10 d. After being either cold-shocked or non-cold-shocked, commercial chicken breasts without skin and chicken thighs with skin were inoculated in separate experiments with each bacterium. Samples were crust frozen at -85 degrees C for 20 min or completely frozen at -85 degrees C for 60 min. The E. coli and Salmonella Typhimurium were recovered on appropriate selective and nonselective media containing the corresponding antibiotic. Log reductions and extent of injury were calculated and treatments were compared using ANOVA. No significant differences were observed in the reduction of cold-shocked or non-cold-shocked bacteria on products with or without skin that were crust or completely frozen. The average reduction for E. coli was 0.15 log(10) cfu/mL of rinse, and for Salmonella Typhimurium 0.10 log10 cfu/mL of rinse; therefore, none of the final reductions were greater than the desired target (1 log). Bacterial cell injury was not significantly different (P > 0.05) among any of the treatments. Data showed no practical significance for initial reduction of these pathogens from crust freezing and thus, this technology should not be considered as a strategy for the reduction of E. coli and Salmonella Typhimurium on poultry.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0032-5791			WOS:000296956900025	22080028

Localized variation in the glass volume (photo-expansion) has been determined through interferometric measurements of surface exposures, whereas induced refractive index change (photo-darkening) was determined from the diffraction efficiency of subsurface direct-written phase gratings. To understand the compositional dependence of the photo-response, the linear and nonlinear optical properties and structure of the unexposed glasses have been compared. The ablation threshold is shown to be controlled by variation of the nonlinear absorption, related to shifts of the absorption band gap with exchange of As by Ge or Sb. Changes in the unexposed network structure show that partial replacement of As by Ge or Sb induces an increased number of As-As bonding defects in the glass, particularly in the form of As4S4 molecular units which become polymerized into the network, impacting the photo-modification process. The Ge was found to induce an increase in the ablation threshold, and enhance both photo-darkening and photo-expansion effects, whereas Sb was shown to decrease ablation threshold and inhibit photo-darkening while enhancing photo-expansion.									3	0	0	0	0	3			2041-1286			WOS:000310848500007		
J	Riley, Melissa B								University multi-user facility survey-2010.								Journal of biomolecular techniques : JBT				22	4			131	5					2011-Dec	2011	Multi-user facilities serve as a resource for many universities. In 2010, a survey was conducted investigating possible changes and successful characteristics of multi-user facilities, as well as identifying problems in facilities. Over 300 surveys were e-mailed to persons identified from university websites as being involved with multi-user facilities. Complete responses were received from 36 facilities with an average of 20 years of operation. Facilities were associated with specific departments (22%), colleges (22%), and university research centers (8.3%) or were not affiliated with any department or college within the university (47%). The five most important factors to succeed as a multi-user facility were: 1) maintaining an experienced, professional staff in an open atmosphere; 2) university-level support providing partial funding; 3) broad client base; 4) instrument training programs; and 5) an effective leader and engaged strategic advisory group. The most significant problems were: 1) inadequate university financial support and commitment; 2) problems recovering full service costs from university subsidies and user fees; 3) availability of funds to repair and upgrade equipment; 4) inability to retain highly qualified staff; and 5) unqualified users dirtying/damaging equipment. Further information related to these issues and to fee structure was solicited. Overall, there appeared to be a decline in university support for facilities and more emphasis on securing income by serving clients outside of the institution and by obtaining grants from entities outside of the university.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1943-4731		MEDLINE:22131888	22131888

Direct Detection of the Acetate-forming Activity of the Enzyme Acetate Kinase								JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS					58					UNSP e3474	10.3791/3474			DEC 2011	2011	Acetate kinase, a member of the acetate and sugar kinase-Hsp70-actin (ASKHA) enzyme superfamily(1-5), is responsible for the reversible phosphorylation of acetate to acetyl phosphate utilizing ATP as a substrate. Acetate kinases are ubiquitous in the Bacteria, found in one genus of Archaea, and are also present in microbes of the Eukarya(6). The most well characterized acetate kinase is that from the methane-producing archaeon Methanosarcina thermophila(7-14). An acetate kinase which can only utilize PPi but not ATP in the acetyl phosphate-forming direction has been isolated from Entamoeba histolytica, the causative agent of amoebic dysentery, and has thus far only been found in this genus(15,16).In the direction of acetyl phosphate formation, acetate kinase activity is typically measured using the hydroxamate assay, first described by Lipmann(17-20), a coupled assay in which conversion of ATP to ADP is coupled to oxidation of NADH to NAD(+) by the enzymes pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase(21,22), or an assay measuring release of inorganic phosphate after reaction of the acetyl phosphate product with hydroxylamine(23.) Activity in the opposite, acetate-forming direction is measured by coupling ATP formation from ADP to the reduction of NADP(+) to NADPH by the enzymes hexokinase and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase(24).Here we describe a method for the detection of acetate kinase activity in the direction of acetate formation that does not require coupling enzymes, but is instead based on direct determination of acetyl phosphate consumption. After the enzymatic reaction, remaining acetyl phosphate is converted to a ferric hydroxamate complex that can be measured spectrophotometrically, as for the hydroxamate assay. Thus, unlike the standard coupled assay for this direction that is dependent on the production of ATP from ADP, this direct assay can be used for acetate kinases that produce ATP or PPi.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1940-087X			WOS:000209222300028

Nanoparticle agglomerate diameters ranged from 388 +/- 188 nm when synthesized in water and 37 +/- 2 nm when synthesized in methanol. Suspension stability is paramount for producing optically transparent materials. Methanol nanoparticle synthesized at a pH of 3 exhibited the smallest agglomerate size. Optical spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and zeta potential analysis were used to characterize the particles synthesized.									6	0	0	0	0	6			2073-4360			WOS:000208601800025

Phosphorus retention in lab and field-scale subsurface-flow wetlands treating plant nursery runoff								ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING				37	12			1968	1976		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2011.08.009			DEC 2011	2011	Constructed wetland systems built to handle nutrient contaminants are often efficient at removing nitrogen, but ineffective at reducing phosphorus (P) loads. Incorporating a clay-based substrate can enhance P removal in subsurface-flow constructed wetland systems. We evaluated the potential of crushed brick, a recycled building product, and two particle sizes of a palygorskite-bentonite industrial mineral aggregate (calcined clay) to sorb P from simulated nutrient-rich plant nursery effluent. The three substrates were screened for P sorbing behavior using sorption, desorption, and equilibration experiments. We selected one substrate to evaluate in an 8-month field trial to compare field sorption capacity with laboratory sorption capacity. In the laboratory, coarse calcined clay average sorption capacity was 497 mg kg(-1) and it sorbed the highest percentage of P supplied (76%), except at exposure concentrations >100 mg L(-1) where the increased surface area of fine calcined clay augmented its P sorption capacity. Subsurface-flow mesocosms were filled with coarse calcined clay and exposed to a four and seven day hydraulic retention time treatment. Phosphorus export was reduced by 60 to 74% for both treatments until substrate P-binding sites began to saturate during month seven. During the eight month experiment, the four and seven day treatments fixed 1273 +/- 22 mg kg(-1) P and 937 +/- 16 mg kg(-1) P. respectively. Sequential extractions of the P saturated clay indicated that P could desorb slowly over time from various pools within the calcined clay; thus, if the calcined clay were recycled as a soil amendment, most P released would be slowly available for plant uptake and use. This study demonstrated the viability of using coarse calcined clay as a root bed substrate in subsurface-flow treatment wetlands remediating phosphorus from plant nursery runoff.

However, little is known regarding how CeO(2) exposure may influence pulmonary or systemic inflammation. Furthermore, how mast cells would influence inflammatory responses to a nanoparticle exposure is unknown. We thus compared pulmonary and cardiovascular responses between C57BL/6 and B6.Cg-Kit(W-sh) mast cell deficient mice following CeO(2) nanoparticle instillation. C57BL/6 mice instilled with CeO(2) exhibited mild pulmonary inflammation. However, B6.Cg-Kit(W-sh) mice did not display a similar degree of inflammation following CeO(2) instillation. Moreover, C57BL/6 mice instilled with CeO(2) exhibited altered aortic vascular responses to adenosine and an increase in myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury which was absent in B6.Cg-Kit(W-sh) mice. In vitro CeO(2) exposure resulted in increased production of PGD(2), TNF-alpha, IL-6 and osteopontin by cultured mast cells. These findings demonstrate that CeO(2) nanoparticles activate mast cells contributing to pulmonary inflammation, impairment of vascular relaxation and exacerbation of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury.									21	0	0	14	0	21			1743-5390			WOS:000296633100007	21043986

Morphological responses of Legionella pneumophila biofilm to nanoparticle exposure								NANOTOXICOLOGY				5	4			730	742		10.3109/17435390.2010.550696			DEC 2011	2011	Legionella pneumophila is a pathogenic bacterium that forms biofilms in natural and anthropogenic habitats. This feature not only facilitates colonization but also limits the effectiveness of biocides. L. pneumophila was exposed to three sizes of citrate-capped gold nanospheres in both planktonic and biofilm stages. TEM micrographs indicated that gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) adsorbed to the bacterial cell surface, were absorbed into the cells, aggregated within the cells, and integrated into the extrapolymeric matrix of the biofilm. Both 4 and 18 nm, but not 50 nm AuNPs caused an alteration of biofilm morphology. Treatment with 20 nm polystyrene spheres did not induce these changes suggesting that the response was a result of the gold and not just the presence of the nanosphere. The morphological changes observed in the biofilm suggest that aquatic ecosystems may be affected by nanoparticle exposure. This may compromise ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycling facilitated by natural biofilms.									13	1	0	11	0	13			1743-5390			WOS:000296633100022	21294606

Three independent ratings were collected on each of 244 neighborhoods in 132 census block groups in five South Carolina counties, for a total of 732 observations. Inter-rater reliability analysis showed 92.6% agreement among at least two raters and an intraclass correlation of .54, indicating acceptable reliability. Exploratory factor analysis extracted eight factors for neighborhood physical appearance, school/park/public space physical appearance, neighborhood social appearance, indicated social engagement, observed social engagement, park/public space social engagement, resident watchfulness, and neighborhood safety risk. A follow-up confirmatory factor analysis supported the eight factor structure. Reliability analysis produced alpha coefficients ranging from .55 to .94 for the eight factors, indicating reliability for use as sub-scales. Convergent validity was determined by generally acceptable correlations of the factor sub-scales with measures of neighborhood distress, rates of child maltreatment and ICD-9-CM coded child injuries, and resident perceptions of neighboring, collective efficacy, reciprocal helping, and children's safety in the home. Implications for research and policy and program development are discussed.									3	0	0	0	1	3			0303-8300			WOS:000296291500006

Here, the "serviceability failure" is said to occur when the excavation-induced wall or ground movement exceeds specified limiting values. Knowledge of this probability can aid in engineering decision-making to prevent damage to adjacent infrastructures. The proposed framework consists of five elements: (1) finite element method (FEM) for analyzing wall and ground responses in a braced excavation, (2) fuzzy set modeling of parameter uncertainty, (3) spatial averaging technique for handling spatial variability, (4) vertex method for processing fuzzy input through FEM model, and (5) interpretation of fuzzy output. The proposed framework is demonstrated through a well-documented case history. The results show the proposed framework is simple and effective for assessing the probability of serviceability failure in a braced excavation in a spatially random field. To focus on the proposed fuzzy FEM approach, the scope of this paper is limited to one-dimensional modeling of spatial variability with an assumed exponential autocorrelation function.

The effects of surfactant monolayers on free surface natural convection								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER				54	25-26			5348	5358		10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2011.08.008			DEC 2011	2011	An experimental investigation of the effects of surfactant monolayers on free surface natural convection is presented in which the Rayleigh number, Ra, is used to parameterize the Nusselt number, Nu, with the power law scaling Nu = A . Pr(n)Ra(m). Experiments were conducted in water under the following free surface conditions: (1) clean surface, (2) oleyl alcohol covered surface, (3) stearic acid covered surface, and (4) stearyl alcohol covered surface. The use of an infrared (IR) camera permitted confirmation of these surface conditions and the measurement of the surface temperature. The results reveal a reduction of Nu by approximately one order of magnitude in the presence of any of the three surfactants investigated, compared to the clean surface at equivalent Ra. This reduction in convective ability is attributed to the shear-yielding hydrodynamic boundary condition imposed by the monolayers compared to the shear free condition of the clean surface. All four surface conditions yield an exponent m > 1/3, which is attributed to a relatively non-homogeneous temperature boundary condition at the free surface compared to the boundary condition of a Rayleigh-Benard study. A dependence of Nu upon aspect ratio Gamma was also discovered in contrast to earlier work which suggested that Nu is independent of Gamma, at least for large Gamma. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Understanding applicant behavior in employment interviews: A theoretical model of interviewee performance								HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT REVIEW				21	4	SI		353	367		10.1016/j.hrmr.2011.05.003			DEC 2011	2011	The purpose of this article is to present a theoretical model of interviewee performance in selection interviews. Our model positions the construct of interviewee performance as a central mediating variable between candidate attributes and interviewer ratings. The model includes six sets of factors that may influence interviewee performance, interviewer ratings, or both (e.g., interviewer-interviewee dynamics). This model promotes a fundamental shift in the way we think about employment interviews, from a focus on interviewer ratings to a focus on interviewee performance. Factors like culture and interview specific self-efficacy, while receiving little attention in current literature, take on greater significance when viewed through the lens of interviewee performance. A number of avenues for future research are developed and presented, which we hope will encourage future research in this area. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

J	Dudensing, Rebekka M.; Hughes, David W.; Shields, Martin								Perceptions of tourism promotion and business challenges: A survey-based comparison of tourism businesses and promotion organizations								TOURISM MANAGEMENT				32	6			1453	1462		10.1016/j.tourman.2010.10.008			DEC 2011	2011	Tourism is an important economic development driver in the U.S. especially in rural areas. Most US regions have tourism-related economic development organizations to assist the local industry. Despite such assistance, however, many tourism-based businesses struggle. One possible reason is a disconnect between business needs and the activities of related organizations. This study uses survey data from tourism-based businesses and tourism promotion and economic development organizations in rural western Pennsylvania and West Virginia to compare how the various actors perceive the most pressing tourism promotion efforts and business challenges. In general, tourism businesses and support organizations agree on the promotional needs of tourism-based businesses and hold similar perceptions about industry problems. However, tourism promotion agencies underestimate the role of the internet in promotions and perceive workforce issues differently than do businesses. Better alignment of priorities within tourism partnerships should enhance promotional and educational efforts as well as the integration of tourism into overall economic development efforts.

Resting blood pressure was monitored throughout a 24-h period of total sleep deprivation with sustained cognitive work. Twelve participants (23.5%) reported one or more parents with a diagnosis of hypertension. Ten participants were classified as prehypertensive by JNC-7 criteria. Only two prehypertensive subjects reported parental hypertension.Results Results indicate that, as the night shift progressed, participants with a positive family history of hypertension showed significantly higher resting diastolic blood pressure than those with a negative family history of hypertension (p=0.007). Prehypertensive participants showed elevated blood pressure throughout the study.Conclusion These data suggest that rotation to a simulated night shift with sleep deprivation may contribute to blood pressure dysregulation in persons with a positive family history of hypertension.									9	2	0	5	1	11			1070-5503			WOS:000290478100010	20878512

Study 1 led to Study 2, demonstrating the need to conceptualize new ideas for smart nightstands.; Feedback was obtained from intergenerational participants 1 who could discuss their needs and preferences for a smart nightstand.Results: In Study 1, more than 150 items were recorded and categorized into 25 different groups. The authors found 1 that participants utilized the top portion of their nightstand as opposed to the lower sections; most items were found on top of the nightstand or in the top drawer. In Study 2, the authors found that the vast majority of participants are willing to consider the use of a smart nightstand. Participants discussed key functions and design preferences, which included carefully designed storage, the ability to move the nightstand up and down, 1 contemporary design, and interaction through voice activation.Conclusion: Existing nightstands do not meet the needs of current users. This research provides greater understanding of the existing limitations associated with nightstands. Study 2 confirmed that user-centered design and the use of technology can be used to enhance daily living. Smart furniture may play a role in promoting the health and independence of diverse user groups.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1937-5867			WOS:000287902300008	21465437

Between 3.07 and 10.4 vol % the suspensions phase separated into liquid crystalline and isotropic domains. At 12.1 vol %, no isotropic phase was visible, and the samples had the fingerprint texture characteristic of a cholesteric liquid crystal. Below 35 degrees C, temperature had little influence on rheology and phase behavior. However, between 35 and 40 degrees C there was a significant change in both the fraction of isotropic phase and the rheological properties. In contrast to many lyotropic suspensions, the steady shear viscosity did not go through a maximum with increasing concentration. Maxima were observed for complex viscosity, storage modulus, and loss modulus at concentrations that appeared fully liquid crystalline. Time concentration superposition was successful for the loss modulus but not the storage modulus. This suggests that the interface in biphasic samples affects the elastic relaxation but not the viscous response. At still higher concentrations, the fingerprint texture of the liquid crystal phase was absent, and the dispersions behaved as rheological gels.									66	0	0	19	0	66			0024-9297			WOS:000296893400034

The structures of two polymorphs of CsTh(3)F(13) are described in space group P6/mmm with a = 8.2608(14) and c = 8.6519(17) and space group Pmc2(1) with a = 8.1830(16), b = 7.5780(15), and c = 8.6244(17). The analogous orthorhombic compound RbTh(3)F(13), with a = 8.1805(16), b = 7.4378(15), and c = 8.6594(17) in space group Pmc2(1), is also reported. Two other rubidium thorium fluorides are also described: RbTh(2)F(9) crystallizes in the space group Pnma where a = 8.9101(18), b = 11.829(2), and c = 7.4048(15), and Rb(7)Th(6)F(31) crystallizes in the space group R (3) over bar where a = 15.609(2) and c = 10.823(2). Comparison of these materials was made on the basis of their structures and synthesis conditions.

J	Masana, Ravindra; Daqaq, Mohammed F.								Relative performance of a vibratory energy harvester in mono- and bi-stable potentials								JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION				330	24			6036	6052		10.1016/j.jsv.2011.07.031			NOV 21 2011	2011	Motivated by the need for broadband vibratory energy harvesting, many research studies have recently proposed energy harvesters with nonlinear characteristics. Based on the shape of their potential function, such devices are classified as either mono- or bi-stable energy harvesters. This paper aims to investigate the relative performance of these two classes under similar excitations and electric loading conditions. To achieve this goal, an energy harvester consisting of a clamped-clamped piezoelectric beam bi-morph is considered. The shape of the harvester's potential function is altered by applying a static compressive axial load at one end of the beam. This permits operation in the mono-stable (pre-buckling) and bi-stable (post-buckling) configurations. For the purpose of performance comparison, the axial load is used to tune the harvester's oscillation frequencies around the static equilibria such that they have equal values in the mono- and bi-stable configurations. The harvester is subjected to harmonic base excitations of different magnitudes and a slowly varying frequency spanning a wide band around the tuned oscillation frequency. The output voltage measured across a purely resistive load is compared over the frequency range considered. Two cases are discussed: the first compares the performance when the bi-stable harvester has deep potential wells, while the second treats a bi-stable harvester with shallow wells. Both numerical and experimental results demonstrate the essential role that the potential shape plays in conjunction with the base acceleration to determine whether the bi-stable harvester can outperform the mono-stable one and for what range of frequencies. Results also illustrate that, for a bi-stable harvester with shallow potential wells, super-harmonic resonances can activate the inter-well dynamics even for a small base acceleration, thereby producing large voltages in the low frequency range.

Spin density waves in a semiconductor superlattice in a tilted magnetic field								PHYSICAL REVIEW B				84	20					205321	10.1103/PhysRevB.84.205321			NOV 17 2011	2011	The ground state of a semiconductor superlattice (SL) placed in a tilted magnetic field is shown to exhibit a spin-density wave structure when the energy spectrum favors crossings between opposite-spin Landau minibands. The SL is modeled as an array of infinitely attractive quantum wells, whose single energy level is broadened into a miniband of width Delta when weak interwell tunneling is considered. In the presence of the Coulomb interaction, by tailoring the relationship between Delta and the cyclotron and Zeeman energies, the system transitions between paramagnetic, ferromagnetic, spin-density wave (SDW), and ferromagnetic-paramagnetic stripe ordering. These results are obtained by solving numerically a spin-density-wave gap equation derived at T = 0 K in a self-consistent formalism. We find that for a given value of the difference between the Landau energy and the Zeeman splitting, the initial paramagnetic or ferromagnetic order becomes unstable with respect to the formation of a SDW for Delta within a certain range. At larger Delta, the system exhibits alternate ferromagnetic-paramagnetic stripes. In the SDW regime, the fractional polarization is up to the order of several tens of percent.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1098-0121			WOS:000297106600011

Modifying molecule-surface scattering by ultrashort laser pulses								PHYSICAL REVIEW A				84	5					053420	10.1103/PhysRevA.84.053420			NOV 16 2011	2011	In recent years it has become possible to align molecules in free space using ultrashort laser pulses. Here we explore two schemes for controlling molecule-surface scattering processes and which are based on laser-induced molecular alignment. In the first scheme, a single ultrashort nonresonant laser pulse is applied to a molecular beam hitting the surface. This pulse modifies the angular distribution of the incident molecules and causes the scattered molecules to rotate with a preferred sense of rotation (clockwise or counterclockwise). In the second scheme, two properly delayed laser pulses are applied to a molecular beam composed of two chemically close molecular species (isotopes, or nuclear-spin isomers). As the result of the double-pulse excitation, these species are selectively scattered to different angles after the collision with the surface. These effects may provide new means for the analysis and separation of molecular mixtures.									11	0	0	0	0	11			1050-2947			WOS:000297095400005		
J	Goethals, Paul L.; Cho, Byung Rae								Reverse programming the optimal process mean problem to identify a factor space profile								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH				215	1			204	217		10.1016/j.ejor.2011.06.004			NOV 16 2011	2011	For the manufacturer that intends to reduce the processing costs without sacrificing product quality, the identification of the optimal process mean is a problem frequently revisited. The traditional method to solving this problem involves making assumptions on the process parameter values and then determining the ideal location of the mean based upon various constraints such as cost or the degree of quality loss when a product characteristic deviates from its desired target value. The optimal process mean, however, is affected not only by these settings but also by any shift in the variability of a process, thus making it extremely difficult to predict with any accuracy. In contrast, this paper proposes the use of a reverse programming scheme to determine the relationship between the optimal process mean and the settings within an experimental factor space. By doing so, one may gain increased awareness of the sensitivity and robustness of a process, as well as greater predictive capability in the setting of the optimal process mean. Non-linear optimization programming routines are used from both a univariate and multivariate perspective in order to illustrate the proposed methodology. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J	Hur, Jin; Jung, Ka-Young; Schlautman, Mark A.								Altering the characteristics of a leaf litter-derived humic substance by adsorptive fractionation versus simulated solar irradiation								WATER RESEARCH				45	18			6217	6226		10.1016/j.watres.2011.09.023			NOV 15 2011	2011	Changes in the characteristics of a leaf litter-derived humic substance (LLHS) that resulted from its adsorption onto kaolinite or exposure to simulated solar irradiation were tracked using selected spectroscopic descriptors, apparent weight-average molecular weight (MW(w)) and pyrene binding. Heterogeneity within the original bulk LLHS was confirmed by a range of different characteristics obtained from ultrafiltration-based size fractions. In general, trends of some changing LLHS characteristics were similar for the adsorption and irradiation processes when tracked against percent carbon removal. For example, the overall values of specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA), MW(w), and humification index (MIX) all decreased with increasing irradiation time and with increasing concentration of mineral adsorbent in the respective experiments, indicating that both processes resulted in less aromatic and smaller-sized LLHS components remaining in solution. In addition, both the adsorption and irradiation experiments resulted in enrichment of the relative distribution of protein-like fluorescence (PLF), implying the PLF-related components had low affinities for phototransformation and mineral surface adsorption. Despite these apparently similar overall trends in LLHS characteristics caused by the adsorption and irradiation processes, closer examination revealed considerable differences in how the two processes altered the original material. Net production of intermediate-sized constituents was observed only with the irradiation experiments. In addition, residual LLHS resulting from the adsorptive fractionation experiments exhibited consistently higher pyrene binding versus the irradiated LLHS despite having comparable MW(w), values. Changes in LLHS characteristics due to adsorption by kaolinite were likely caused by physical mechanisms (primarily hydrophobic interactions between LLHS components and the kaolinite surface) whereas the irradiation-induced changes appear to have been governed by the combined effects of several alteration mechanisms, including the transformation of more condensed aromatic structures to less aromatic constituents, conformational changes resulting from selective photooxidation, and the photochemical disruption of intramolecular charge-transfer interactions.

Moderate molecular weight (M(n) similar to 12 kg/mol) TP was achieved with glass transition temperatures about 100 degrees C (DSC and DMA). The TP exhibited improved thermal stability compared with polylactide (PLA), with a thermal degradation temperature of about 80 degrees C higher than PLA. Although the TP exhibited distinctly different surface morphology compared with that of PLA, both showed similar contact angle and surface energy (ca. 40 mN/m) properties. Blends of PLA and TP showed enhanced glass transition (similar to 5 degrees C change in T(g)) temperatures compared with PLA homopolymer. This is due to the compatibility of PLA and TP. Thus, TP could be used as an additive for PLA-based blends to enhance compatibility with phenolic-based resins. TP electrospun fiber morphology is also reported. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Analysis of Stability of Nanotube Dispersions Using Surface Tension Isotherms								LANGMUIR				27	22			13451	13460		10.1021/la2028466			NOV 15 2011	2011	In this paper, we present the analyses of surface tension of surfactant-stabilized dispersions of carbon nanotubes. This method allows one to study interactions of carbon nanotubes with surfactants at different levels of nanotube loading when optical methods fall short in quantifying the level of nanotube separation. Sodium dodecyl sulfate was used as a stabilizing agent to uniformly disperse single-walled carbon nanotubes in an aqueous media. We show that surface tension is very sensitive to small changes of nanotube and surfactant concentrations. The experimental data suggest that, at moderate concentrations, surfactant displaces carbon nanotubes from the air water interface and the nanotubes are mostly moved into the bulk of the liquid. By analyzing the surface tension as a function of surfactant concentration, we obtained the dependence of critical micelle concentration on nanotube loading. We then constructed the adsorption isotherm for dodecyl sulfate on carbon nanotubes and bundles of carbon nanotubes. The results of these experiments enabled us to extend the phase diagram of the produced dispersions to a broader range of surfactant and nanotube concentrations.									23	1	0	0	0	23			0743-7463			WOS:000296598300009	21961935

The effects of proton radiation on UHMWPE material properties for space flight and medical applications								ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH				48	10			1572	1577		10.1016/j.asr.2011.07.009			NOV 15 2011	2011	Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE) is a polymer widely used as a radiation shielding material in space flight applications and as a bearing material in total joint replacements. As a long chain hydrocarbon based polymer, UHMWPE's material properties are influenced by radiation exposure, and prior studies show that gamma irradiation is effective for both medical sterilization and increased wear resistance in total joint replacement applications. However, the effects of space flight radiation types and doses on UHMWPE material properties are poorly understood. In this study, three clinically relevant grades of UHMWPE (GUR 1020, GUR 1050, and GUR 1020 blended with Vitamin E) were proton irradiated and tested for differences in material properties. Each of the three types of UHMWPE was irradiated at nominal doses of 0 Gy (control), 5 Gy, 10 Gy, 20 Gy, and 35 Gy. Following irradiation, uniaxial tensile testing and thermal testing using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA) were performed. Results show small but significant changes in several material properties between the control (0 Gy) and 35 Gy samples, indicating that proton irradiation could have a effect on the long term performance of UHMWPE in both medical and space flight applications.

Densities are converted to exosphere temperatures using the parametric relationship that exists between density and temperature in the NRLMSISe00 empirical model. Daily, seasonal and solar-cycle dependencies of DW1 and SW2 in exosphere temperature are elucidated, and similarities and differences with NRLMSISe00 are detailed. In addition, using TIMED/SABER measurements between 80-110 km and viscous tidal theory, it is demonstrated that the measured seasonal-latitudinal variation of the semidiurnal exosphere temperature amplitude is dominated by the part excited in-situ in the thermosphere, as opposed to those tidal components that propagate upwards from the lower atmosphere.									9	0	0	0	0	9			2169-9380	2169-9402		WOS:000297063000004

To establish whether direct Se-Cu coordination may be involved in selenium antioxidant activity, Cu(I) coordination of the selenoamino acids methyl-Se-cysteine (MeSeCys) and selenomethionine (Se Met) was investigated. NMR results in D2O indicate that Cu(I) binds to the Se atom of both MeSeCys and Se Met as well as the carboxylic acid oxygen atom(s) or amine nitrogen atoms. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and density functional theory (DFT) results confirm Se-Cu coordination, with the identification of a 2.4 angstrom Se-Cu vector in both the Se- and Cu-EXAFS data. XAS studies also show Cu(I) in an unusual three-coordinate environment with the additional two ligands arising from O/N (2.0 angstrom). DFT models of 1:1 Cu-selenoamino acid complexes suggest that both selenoamino acids coordinate Cu(I) through the selenium and amino groups, with the third ligand assumed to be water. These compounds represent the first structurally characterized copper(I) complexes with sulfur- or selenium-containing amino acids.									8	0	0	4	0	8			0020-1669			WOS:000296303900054	21999616

With the use of an unprecedented approach involving high temperature, molten salt methods, a fascinating series of salt-inclusion solids (SISs) that contain high nuclearity POMs has been isolated for the first time. Cs(11)Na(3)(V(15)O(36))Cl(6) (1) was synthesized using the eutectic NaCl/CsCl flux (mp 493 degrees C) which serves as a reactive solvent in crystal growth and allows for the SIS formation. Its framework can be viewed as an "ionic" lattice composed of alternately packed counterions of Cl-centered [V(15)O(36)Cl](9-) clusters (V15; S = 11/2) and multinuclear [Cs(9)Na(3)Cl(5)](7+) cations. In light of the structural analysis, 1 was proven to be soluble in water giving rise to a dark green solution that is similar in color to single crystals of the title compound. Infrared spectroscopy of the solid formed from fast evaporation of the solution supports the presence of dissolved V15 clusters. Also noteworthy is the magnetization of! at 2 K, which reveals an s-shaped plot resembling that of superparamagnetic materials.									11	0	0	2	0	11			0020-1669			WOS:000296303900073	21951029

This paper aims to close this gap by presenting an observation-based Climatological Tidal Model of the Thermosphere (CTMT) of self-consistent upward propagating migrating and nonmigrating diurnal and semidiurnal tides from 80-400 km and pole-to-pole for moderate (F10.7 = 110 sfu) solar flux conditions. CTMT includes the 6 (8) most important diurnal (semidiurnal) tidal components for temperature, density, and zonal, meridional and vertical winds and is based on Hough Mode Extension fits to 2002-2008 mean TIMED satellite tidal diagnostics in the mesosphere/lower thermosphere (MLT). Validation with independent 2002-2008 CHAMP tidal diagnostics (F10.7 = 105 sfu) around 400 km proves that the approach captures nonmigrating tides well, indicating that these waves propagate directly upward without significant tidal forcing occurring in the thermosphere. Notable exceptions are the DW2 and D0 components that are most likely generated in-situ by nonlinear interaction forcing in the upper thermosphere. CTMT is suitable for driving upper atmosphere models that require self-consistent tidal fields in the MLT region as a lower boundary condition. It does not include migrating tides due to in-situ EUV absorption in the upper thermosphere but allows us to quantitatively assess thermospheric variability due to tides from the lower atmosphere. This is done by discussing longitude/latitude maps of reconstructed diurnal and semidiurnal tidal variations as function of altitude and local time.									33	1	0	0	0	33			2169-9380	2169-9402		WOS:000296631900003

We show that the superfluid order parameter destroyed by a large Zeeman field can be restored by the SOC. With increasing strengths of the Zeeman field, there is a series of topological quantum phase transitions from a nontopological superfluid state with fully gapped fermionic spectrum to a topological superfluid state with four topologically protected Fermi points (i.e., nodes in the quasiparticle excitation gap) and then to a second topological superfluid state with only two Fermi points. The quasiparticle excitations near the Fermi points realize the long-sought low-temperature analog of Weyl fermions of particle physics. We show that the topological phase transitions can be probed using the experimentally realized momentum-resolved photoemission spectroscopy.									154	6	0	10	0	155			0031-9007			WOS:000297006700007	22181619

A new astronomy with radioactivity: Radiogenic carbon chemistry								NEW ASTRONOMY REVIEWS				55	5-6			155	165		10.1016/j.newar.2011.08.001			NOV-DEC 2011	2011	Historically it has been assumed that the necessary condition for carbon solids to grow in a cooling gas is higher bulk C abundance than O abundance. That condition is observed to be necessary and valid in AGB red-giant stars, inducing more general acceptance of that requirement. But for hydrogen-free supernova interiors that bulk-abundance condition is too restrictive. Within their expanding and cooling interiors, radioactivity maintains a prolific source for new free C. Very abundant CO molecules cannot retain oxidized carbon owing to their dissociation by energetic free electrons, which are created continuously by Compton scattering of gamma rays from newly created radioactive Co-56 nuclei. As the local gas temperature cools below 2000 K the free C atoms condense as carbonaceous grains, even in the presence of more abundant O atoms. The necessary conditions within supernovae must instead be expressed by three new rules:1. Free C atoms must exist abundantly. An abundance ratio C/O > 1 would indeed suffice for that end, but it is not necessary. Maintenance of abundant free C atoms occurs by radioactivity dissociating abundant CO molecules and also by lack of sufficient expansion time for complete oxidation of free C.2. Chemical reaction networks associating C atoms into C solids must be kinetically faster than their oxidation. That is, free C must be able to grow C solids faster than those solids can be oxidized.3. Insufficient time for oxidation of the new carbon solids must exist after the eventual depletion of free carbon prior to ejection into the interstellar medium. Those C solids could be termed metastable because they would be absent but for the chemical consequences of the radioactivity.I present some calculations for these expectations elaborating on figures from published works. The chemical dynamics provide a new discipline of astronomy with radioactivity in young supernova remnants. Carbonaceous supernova condensates (graphite and silicon carbide) extracted from meteorites provide abundant isotopic evidence of dynamic details of young supernova remnants. But expertise from molecular and chemical dynamics is needed to bring the theory to fruition. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1387-6473			WOS:000300753600001

Evaluation of a Soil Decompaction and Amendment Process for Urban Trees								Arboriculture & Urban Forestry				37	6			293	300					NOV 2011	2011	Researchers investigated the effects of a soil decompaction and amendment process (AFM) and its individual components (air tillage, fertilizer, and mulch) on soil properties at four urban sites: Anderson, South Carolina; Boston, Massachusetts; Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, U.S. At each site, 50 red maples (Acer rubrum) were growing on compacted and/or nutrient-poor soils whose pre-treatment bulk densities ranged from 1.14 to 1.74 g/cm(3). Treatments were applied in the autumn and winter of 2005-2006, and measurements were taken through the end of 2008. The AFM treatment significantly reduced soil strength relative to control at all sites in 2006. There were significant treatment x location interactions in all years, with higher bulk density sites (Anderson and Myrtle Beach) showing the greatest magnitude and duration of response. The AFM and mulch treatments generally increased soil organic matter content, while air tillage alone significantly lowered soil organic matter content in Pittsburgh. At most sites, the AFM treatment was more effective than surface fertilizer application at improving soil fertility. AFM and mulched plots had significantly higher soil water content than other plots during periods of summer drought. Overall, AFM was effective in improving soils beneath established trees, and mulching was the most beneficial of the individual treatments.									1	0	0	2	0	2			1935-5297			BCI:BCI201200565223

The technique employed allows for the evaluation of potential ceramic and crystalline laser materials. The frequency of the dominant phonon that deactivates the fluorescing levels and an approximate prediction of 0 K lifetime can be determined. Results show no significant quantitative difference between very large grain polycrystalline (with grain size similar to 200-500 mu m) ceramic, fine grain polycrystalline (with grain size similar to 0.3 mu m) ceramic and the precursor powder (with similar to 30 nm particle size) of Er(3+) doped Y(2)O(3), when it comes to the dominant phonon frequency and the phonon occupancy number.The results show that a correct evaluation of the final product can be made in the precursor stage of the process eliminating the need to proceed to crystalline or fully sintered ceramic form to evaluate the spectroscopic properties of the material. It should be noted that the powders must be carefully prepared and handled. Adsorbed species such as water can drastically change the effective lifetimes observed in powder samples.

These materials are investigated from the perspective of thermal and electronic transport properties for enhancing the dimensionless figure of merit (ZT) at 800-1000 K. The electronic origin of thermopower enhancement is reviewed. Grain refinement and embedment of nanoparticles in HH alloy hosts were used to produce fine-grained as well as nanocomposites and monolithic nanostructured materials. Present experiments indicated that n-type Hf0.6Zr0.4NiSn0.995Sb0.005 HH alloys and p-type Hf0.3Zr0.7CoSn0.3Sb0.7/nano-ZrO2 composites can attain ZT = 1.05 and 0.8 near 900-1000 K, respectively. The observed ZT enhancements could be attributed to multiple origins; in particular, the electronic origin was identified. The prospect for higher ZT was investigated in light of a recently developed nanostructure model of lattice thermal conductivity. Tests performed on p-n couple devices from the newly developed HH materials showed good power generation efficiencies-achieving 8.7% efficiency for hot-side temperatures of about 700 degrees C.									52	0	0	1	0	52			0884-2914			WOS:000299874600001

The intense plasma jet is possible through jet-to-jet coupling in eight-quartz-tube arrays. To describe this coupling, optical properties of the intense plasma jet are compared with those of a single tubing plasma jet. The optical intensity from the intense plasma jet by jet-to-jet coupling was approximately three times larger than that of a conventional single plasma jet under identical driving and gas conditions.									6	3	0	0	0	9			0093-3813			WOS:000299683400112

A rapid hydrothermal synthesis is carried out to grow ZnO nanowires by a variable power microwave sintering system. The optical emission spectra of the honeycomb structured plasma jet array show that excited OH, N-2, N-2(+), He, and O exist in the plasma jet array and the many gaseous species in the air participated in the plasma process. Surface modification by atmospheric plasma resulted in reduced contact angles from 111.23 degrees to 8.70 degrees as a function of plasma duration time.									1	4	0	0	0	5			0093-3813			WOS:000299683400123

Two individual plasma plumes of He and Ar were generated and focused at a certain point. When the gas flow ratio was 3: 1 between the Ar and He gases, the dual plasma plume exhibited the longest focal distance from the nozzle, and it was sustaining as a well-balanced state. The optical emission spectra of the plasma plume showed that the merged plasma plume had both excited He and Ar species.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0093-3813			WOS:000299683400124

Despite an equally distributed gas flow, the outermost tubes did not produce strong individual plumes. Rather, the plasma plumes were drawn into the central plume, which was, in turn, amplified. As a result, the optical intensity from the 19-array plasma jet was nearly twice greater than that from a conventional single plasma jet at the maximum plasma emission condition of each device under identical applied voltages.									9	3	0	1	0	12			0093-3813			WOS:000299683400142

Optical emissions of sunlight scattered from the dust particles yield measurements of the dust location and flow velocities. Charging by ambient ionospheric electrons of the particulates yields dust particles that stream across the magnetic field lines. These exhaust particles initiate plasma turbulence in the ionosphere that can scatter radar waves. If the exhaust cloud itself passes over in situ particle or plasma wave detectors, measurements can be made of increased dusty plasma wave turbulence and plasma densities. To demonstrate long-range detection of rocket engine burns in the ionosphere, the Charged Aerosol Release Experiment (CARE I) was conducted in September 2009. Optical observations from CARE I provided measurements of both the dust particle distributions and the interactions of the molecular component of the rocket exhaust in the ionosphere.									6	1	0	0	0	6			0093-3813			WOS:000299683400360

Appearance-based periocular features in the context of face and non-ideal iris recognition								SIGNAL IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING				5	4			443	455		10.1007/s11760-011-0248-2			NOV 2011	2011	Developing newer approaches to deal with non-ideal scenarios in face and iris biometrics has been a key focus of research in recent years. The same reason motivates the study of the periocular biometrics as its use has a potential of significantly impacting the iris-and face-based recognition. In this paper, we explore the utility of the various appearance features extracted from the periocular region from different perspectives: (i) as an independent biometric modality for human identification, (ii) as a tool that can aid iris recognition in non-ideal situations in the near infra-red (NIR) spectrum, and (iii) as a possible partial face recognition technique in the visible spectrum. We employ a local appearance-based feature representation, where the periocular image is divided into spatially salient patches, appearance features are computed for each patch locally, and the local features are combined to describe the entire image. The images are matched by computing the distance between the corresponding feature representations using various distance metrics. The evaluation of the periocular region-based recognition and comparison to face recognition is performed in the visible spectrum using the FRGC face dataset. For fusion of the periocular and iris modality, we use the MBGC NIR face videos. We demonstrate that in certain non-ideal conditions encountered in our experiments, the periocular biometrics is superior to iris in the NIR spectrum. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that recognition performance of the periocular region images is comparable to that of face in the visible spectrum.									8	0	0	1	0	8			1863-1703	1863-1711		WOS:000300162600005

ADVANCES IN FOREST HYDROLOGY: CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES								TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE				54	6			2049	2056					NOV-DEC 2011	2011	Forests are an integral component of the landscape, and maintaining their functional integrity is fundamental for the sustainability of ecosystems and societies alike. Tools, innovations, and practices, analogous to those developed to improve agricultural production and quantify environmental impacts, are needed to ensure the sustainability of these forested landscapes as well as the ecosystem goods and services they produce. This article introduces ten technical articles on critical ecohydrologic processes, protection and restoration, and the effects of management practices on the hydrology and water quality of forests and forested wetlands, using both monitoring and modeling approaches. Prepared by experts in forest science, forest and agricultural hydrology and water management, the studies reported in this special collection are concentrated in the Atlantic Coastal plain and focus on forests with shallow water tables. Experimental studies describe the effects of riparian vegetation harvest, human disturbance, and future climatic change on groundwater; the significance of emergent vegetation after harvest, and long-term hydrologic water balance of a managed pine forest. Modeling studies use the SWAT model to predict streamflow dynamics of a less disturbed, coastal forested watershed, and DRAINMOD to determine the impacts of minor silvicultural drainage on wetland hydrology and to improve wetland restoration. Finally a study describes potential uncertainties associated with infrequent water sampling of nutrient loads from drained forested watersheds. This introductory article summarizes these studies of shallow water table forests and relates them to the broader field of forest hydrology, including its challenges and opportunities, while identifying pressing issues of land use and climate change. The results from these studies should help guide management and restoration of forest wetland ecosystems and direct future forest hydrologic research, including research in large prior converted agricultural landscapes.									4	0	0	0	0	4			2151-0032			WOS:000299363300009		
J	Adler, Peter H.; Huang, Yao Te								Integrated systematics of the Simuliidae (Diptera): evolutionary relationships of the little-known Palearctic black fly Simulium acrotrichum								CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST				143	6			612	628		10.4039/n11-035			NOV-DEC 2011	2011	Simulium (Simulium) acrotrichum Rubtsov, a black fly from Central Asia, provides a platform for examining the evolutionary relationships of selected species groups in the subgenus Simulium Latreille. The female, male, pupa, and larva of S. acrotrichum are properly associated and morphologically redescribed and illustrated. The banding sequence of the larval polytene chromosomes is compared with that of the Simulium subgeneric standard, from which it differs by nearly 30 fixed rearrangements. Structural and chromosomal features indicate that S. acrotrichum is the sister species of S. flavidum Rubtsov. Simulium acrotrichum can be placed confidently in a group consisting of the S. malyschevi Dorogostaisky, Rubtsov, and Vlasenko and S. reptans (L.) groups, which are part of a larger clade that also includes the S. jenningsi Malloch group. This more inclusive clade is defined chromosomally by a minimum of four fixed inversions, compared with the standard map for the subgenus Simulium. All four inversions are uniquely derived relative to the two selected outgroups, Simulium (Psilozia) vittatum Zetterstedt and Simulium (Boophthora) erythrocephalum (De Geer). The independent monophyly of the S. malyschevi and S. reptans groups, however, cannot be tested without study of additional group members. The problems illustrated by the taxonomic identity and phylogenetic placement of S. acrotrichum argue for an integrated approach to simuliid systematics, drawing from the character stores of morphology, cytology, and molecular biology.									16	0	0	16	0	16			0008-347X			WOS:000299304600005

Response Surface Methodology for Meat-Like Odorants from the Maillard Reaction with Glutathione II: The Tendencies Analysis of Meat-Like Donors								JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE				76	9			C1267	C1277		10.1111/j.1750-3841.2011.02423.x			NOV-DEC 2011	2011	Understanding the flavor effect of molecules on food products is fundamental for the food technologist. In this study, the formation of different meat-like compounds was controlled by various influence factors. Furthermore, the concept of interrelationships between Maillard reaction products (MRPs) was demonstrated by statistical analysis for the first time, which provides data and hence production system parameters by which to generate and optimize meat-like flavors through Maillard reactions. We report here the analysis and synthesis trend of the 13 meat-like donors which are regarded as forming the major flavor compounds of cooked meat. Response surface methodology (RSM) has not previously been reported in the literature as a technique to identify which parameters have the greatest influence on the synthesis of these flavor compounds. RSM has been used here to identify the influence of initial pH and ?pH on flavor compound generation. As all ?pH had positive RSM values between 0.5 and 1.5 it can be concluded that MRPs of this meat flavor-adapted system would be mostly acidic. These positive values also indicate that under this condition the Maillard reaction is stable and will therefore promote more meat-like flavor compounds to be generated. In addition to ?pH, varied concentrations of glutathione, cysteine, thiamine, and xylose were investigated for their ability to influence the generation of meat-like flavors.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0022-1147			WOS:000297457000041	22416688

Using high-quality, broad-band afterglow data for GRB 091127, we investigate the validity of the synchrotron fireball model for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and infer physical parameters of the ultra-relativistic outflow.Methods. We used multi-wavelength (NIR to X-ray) follow-up observations obtained with GROND simultaneously in the g'r'i'z' JH filters and the XRT onboard the Swift satellite in the 0.3 to 10 keV energy range. The resulting afterglow light curve is of excellent accuracy with relative photometric errors as low as 1%, and the spectral energy distribution (SED) is well-sampled over 5 decades in energy. These data present one of the most comprehensive observing campaigns for a single GRB afterglow and allow us to test several proposed emission models and outflow characteristics in unprecedented detail.Results. Both the multi-color light curve and the broad-band SED of the afterglow of GRB 091127 show evidence of a cooling break moving from high to lower energies. The early light curve is well described by a broken power-law, where the initial decay in the optical/NIR wavelength range is considerably flatter than at X-rays. Detailed fitting of the time-resolved SED shows that the break is very smooth with a sharpness index of 2.2 +/- 0.2, and evolves towards lower frequencies as a power-law with index -1.23 +/- 0.06. These are the first accurate and contemporaneous measurements of both the sharpness of the spectral break and its time evolution.Conclusions. The measured evolution of the cooling break (gamma(c) proportional to t(similar to-1.2)) is not consistent with the predictions of the standard model, wherein gamma(c) proportional to t(similar to-0.5) is expected. A possible explanation for the observed behavior is a time dependence of the microphysical parameters, in particular the fraction of the total energy in the magnetic field epsilon(B). This conclusion provides further evidence that the standard fireball model is too simplistic, and time-dependent micro-physical parameters may be required to model the growing number of well-sampled afterglow light curves.									23	0	0	0	0	23			0004-6361			WOS:000297841200069

Jensen, Matthew/0000-0002-5229-7382			A Customizable Automotive Steering System With a Haptic Feedback Control Strategy for Obstacle Avoidance Notification								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY				60	9			4208	4216		10.1109/TVT.2011.2172472			NOV 2011	2011	Increased global use of motorized vehicles has led to a higher number of automotive crashes involving human injuries and fatalities. Greater driver awareness through haptic feedback can provide vital information from the vehicle and surroundings to the driver while minimizing driver distraction. In this paper, steering wheel haptic feedback will be provided to increase the drivers' knowledge of the roadway and driving conditions. This increased knowledge should enable the driver to avoid obstacles presented in the roadway earlier than without any feedback. A high-fidelity customizable driving simulator was utilized to provide nine different levels of sinusoidal haptic feedback via the steering wheel. Mathematical models for the vehicle steering system, with adjustable controller gains, were developed to create torsional feedback. The testing included 25 human subjects ranging in age and driving experience. Driver preferences for feedback amplitude and frequency were gathered, whereas driver/vehicle performance was used as the measure of feedback effectiveness. The laboratory results demonstrate that haptic steering feedback improved driver performance as measured by a 62% reduction in obstacle hit rates, small reductions in peak steering wheel angle and peak vehicle yaw rate, as well as a nearly 10 m (32.8 ft) increase in reaction distance to the obstacles. The research contribution is the successful application of an advanced steering simulator with a steering control strategy to introduce supplemental haptic feedback to the driver through the steering system for roadway avoidance notification.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0018-9545	1939-9359		WOS:000297945900011		
J	Welter, Brenda H.; Goldston, Amanda M.; Temesvari, Lesly A.								Localisation to lipid rafts correlates with increased function of the Gal/GalNAc lectin in the human protozoan parasite, Entamoeba histolytica								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY				41	13-14			1409	1419		10.1016/j.ijpara.2011.10.003			NOV-DEC 2011	2011	Entamoeba histolytica is the causative agent of dysentery and liver abscess and is prevalent in developing countries. Adhesion to the host is critical to infection and is mediated by amoebic surface receptors. One such receptor, the Gal/GalNAc lectin, binds to galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine residues on host components and consists of heavy (Hgl). light (Lgl) and intermediate (lgl) subunits. The mechanism by which the lectin assembles into a functional complex is not known. The parasite also relies on cholesterol-rich domains (lipid rafts) for adhesion. Therefore, it is conceivable that rafts regulate the assembly or function of the lectin. To test this, amoebae were loaded with cholesterol and lipid rafts were purified and characterised. Western blotting showed that cholesterol loading resulted in co-compartmentalisation of all three subunits in rafts. This co-compartmentalisation was accompanied by an increase in the ability of the amoebae to bind to host cells in a galactose-specific manner, suggesting that there is a correlation between location and function of the Gal/GalNAc lectin. Cholesterol loading did not increase the surface levels of the lectin subunits. Therefore, the cholesterol-induced increase in adhesion was not the result of externalisation of an internal pool of subunits. A mutant cell line that modestly responded to cholesterol with a slight increase in adhesion exhibited only a slight enrichment of Hgl and Lgl in rafts. This supports the connection between location and function of the Gal/GalNAc lectin. Actin can also influence the interaction of proteins with rafts. Therefore, the sub-membrane distribution of the lectin subunits was also assessed after treatment with an actin depolymerising agent, cytochalasin D. Cytochalasin D-treatment had no effect on the submembrane distribution of the subunits, suggesting that actin does not prevent the association of lectin subunits with rafts in this system. Together, these data provide insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating the location and function of this adhesin. 2011 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A superfine hydrated lime used in the study was produced from regular hydrated lime (RHL) by a Los Angeles abrasion machine. The superfine lime was measured to be 660 nm, approximately half of the RHL size of 1.3 mu m, a sub-nano-sized hydrated lime (SNHL). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) pictures were taken to observe the difference of the crushed lime in size, shape, and texture. Experiments for antistripping properties, such as indirect tensile strength (ITS), tensile strength ratio (TSR), flow, and toughness were conducted on WMA mixtures containing SNHL and RHL as control samples. A total of 18 mixtures and 108 specimens were prepared from three types of aggregate, three WMA additives, and two types of lime. The results indicated that the microstructures of the SNHL and RHL are irregular: the lime particles have fractured and rough surfaces with sharp angles; some small spherical particles in the nano size were found in SNHL but not in RHL. Also, WMA mixtures using SNHL have greater ITS and TSR than those using RHL; an increases of 8% in ITS and 10% in TSR by using SNHL over RHL were observed for the WMA mixtures investigated. Finally, the antistripping properties of WMA mixtures containing SNHL were affected predominately by aggregate type and the WMA additive. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0000308.

J	Gaimon, Cheryl; Oezkan, Guelru F.; Napoleon, Karen								Dynamic Resource Capabilities: Managing Workforce Knowledge with a Technology Upgrade								ORGANIZATION SCIENCE				22	6			1560	1578		10.1287/orsc.1100.0598			NOV-DEC 2011	2011	Although managers invest in new technology to improve performance, often the benefits sought are elusive while the costs incurred far exceed expectations. The literature offers insights to help explain this phenomenon. Evidence suggests that, while carefully considering the purchase cost, managers often underestimate the costs and planning necessary for proper implementation. Consequently, short-term problems arise and long-term benefits are not realized. A model is introduced that integrates workforce knowledge management with the technology upgrade decision. The manager upgrades technology or pursues general training of the workforce in response to depreciation in the ability of each resource to drive net income over time. Depreciation occurs because of changes in consumer preferences and competition. Although adding to technology capability, an upgrade makes a portion of workforce knowledge obsolete. The manager invests in preparatory training prior to the upgrade to reduce obsolescence. Whereas general training is pursued to respond to depreciation by enhancing the ability of the workforce to improve existing products or create new products, preparatory training is technology-specific and focused on preparing for a technology upgrade. We find that the rates of preparatory and general training follow entirely different paths over time. Conditions are given where a manager uses one training strategy as a substitute for or complement to the other. We show that training strategies are not only impacted by learning phenomena such as the rate of forgetting, but also by the rates of technology depreciation and advancement. We show how workforce learning phenomena impact the technology upgrade decision.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1047-7039			WOS:000297510200012

In a 2008 paper published in the IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTROMAGNETIC COMPATIBILITY, a closed-form expression was developed to estimate the maximum radiated emissions from board-source-cable structures. While this expression is reasonably accurate for frequencies not exceeding 500 MHz, it may unnecessarily overestimate the emissions in some situations, especially when the maximum frequency of interest is extended beyond 500 MHz. This paper introduces two enhancements to the previously introduced closed-form expression based on improved methods for determining the maximum value of F(theta,k,l(ant)) and the effective board size. The new closed-form expression is evaluated for various board geometries and frequency ranges by comparing the estimated maximum radiated emissions to full-wave simulation results.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0018-9375			WOS:000297342900027

EFFECT OF NUTRIENT STATUS, pH, TEMPERATURE AND WATER POTENTIAL ON GERMINATION AND GROWTH OF RHIZOPUS STOLONIFER AND GILBERTELLA PERSICARIA								JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY				93	3			603	612					NOV 2011	2011	Understanding the impact of environmental factors favouring natural niches of plant pathogens is a key component toward designing efficient management strategies. Rhizopus stolonifer (Ehrenb.:Fr.) Vuill. and Gilbertella persicaria (E.D. Eddy) Hesseltine are two economically important pathogens that are commonly associated in simultaneous infections of many stone and pome fruits. The ability of R. stolonifer and G. pesicaria to assimilate diverse carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) sources and the effect of pH and the interaction temperature/water potential (Psi) on their conidial germination and growth were investigated. The fungi were grown on a liquid medium containing D-glucose, sucrose, fructose, maltose, or raffinose as C sources and urea, NH4NO3, NaNO2, glycine, or glutamine as N sources. The biomass production of R. stolonifer was the greatest when sucrose and fructose were used as C sources, respectively, whereas biomass production of G. persicaria was greater on fructose and glucose than on other sources. Glutamine and sodium nitrite (NaNO2) used as N sources yielded the highest biomass for R. stolonifer and G. persicaria, respectively. Sporangiospore germination and mycelial growth of R. stolonifer and G. persicaria were optimal between pH 3 and 10 and were totally inhibited at pH <= 2.5. The two fungi were affected by the interaction of temperature and W. Both R. stolonifer and G. persicaria were sensitive to low temperatures (< 10 degrees C) and were completely inhibited at Psi levels of -17 and -18.3, respectively. The nutrients utilization, pH, and x temperature profiles for sporangiospore germination and mycelial growth were to some extent similar between the two species corroborating that R. stolonifer and G. persicaria occupy similar ecological niches. Identifying ecophysiological determinants of these commercially important pathogens will contribute to our understanding of their physiology and epidemiology and will aid in developing appropriate models for disease prediction.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1125-4653			WOS:000297609800007

The surface-passivated fluorescent carbon nanoparticles, dubbed 'carbon dots', were already demonstrated for their potential optical bioimaging applications in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we conducted a systematic cytotoxicity evaluation on the carbon dots prepared by various combinations of precursor carbon nanoparticles and molecules for the particle surface functionalization. The results suggested that the cytotoxicity of carbon dots was dependent on the selection of surface passivation molecules. Those dots showing more significant cytotoxicity at higher concentrations were also evaluated for their effects on the fluorescence imaging of live cells. The implications of the results on the eventual use of carbon dots as cell imaging agents are discussed.									40	0	0	7	0	40			1535-3702			WOS:000297383800001	22036734

Cardiovascular-Emotional Dampening: The Relationship Between Blood Pressure and Recognition of Emotion								PSYCHOSOMATIC MEDICINE				73	9			743	750		10.1097/PSY.0b013e318235ed55			NOV-DEC 2011	2011	Objective: Persons with elevated blood pressure (BP) show dampened emotional responses to affect-laden stimuli. We sought to further examine cardiovascular-emotional dampening by examination of the relationship between resting hemodynamic measures and recognition of emotion in an African American community-based sample. Methods: Participants were 106 African American men and women (55 women; mean age = 52.8 years), mainly low in socioeconomic status, and part of the Healthy Aging in Nationally Diverse Longitudinal Samples pilot study. Participants evaluated emotional expressions in faces and sentences using the Perception of Affect Test (PAT). Resting BP, total peripheral resistance (TPR), cardiac output, and heart rate were obtained continuously using a Portapres BP monitor. Results: Total PAT scores were inversely related to systolic (r = -0.30) and diastolic (r = -0.24) BPs, TPR (r = -0.36), and age (r = -0.31; p values < .01) and were positively related to cardiac output (r = 0.27) and education (r = 0.38; p values < .01), as well as with mental state (r = 0.25) and body mass index (r = -0.20; p values < .05). Accuracy of emotion recognition on the PAT tasks remained inversely related to TPR and BP after adjustment for demographic variables, medication, mental state, and body mass index. Conclusions: Elevated BP and TPR were associated with reduced perception of affect. TPR was the most consistent independent hemodynamic correlate of emotional dampening for the PAT scores. These results suggest potentially important links among central nervous system regulation of emotions, hemodynamic processes, and hypertension development.									16	0	2	8	1	19			0033-3174			WOS:000297205700004	22042880

The referring veterinarian elected to perform a caesarian delivery and at the time of surgery a 4 x 4 x 2 cm round, smooth, red to tan, lobulated soft mass was identified attached to the allantoic surface of the zonary placenta of one pup. Microscopically, this mass was composed of loosely arranged confluent undulating cords of polygonal to columnar epithelioid cells separated by a fine fibrovascular stroma resembling the placental labyrinth. The labyrinthine structure and epithelioid nature of the cells suggested that the mass was of trophoblastic origin. Due to the non-invasive nature of the mass and relatively low mitotic activity, this proliferative trophoblastic mass was considered to be benign. The absence of morphological features supporting malignant behaviour and the recapitulation of the normal labyrinthine architecture led to the diagnosis of a trophoblastic hamartoma. To the authors' knowledge this is the first report of a placental hamartoma in the dog. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0021-9975			WOS:000297081900005	21592491

R, and Kousik, C. S. 2011. Sensitivity of isolates of Phytophthora capsici from the eastern United States to fluopicolide. Plant Dis. 95:1414-1419.Fluopicolide, a pyridinylmethyl-benzamide fungicide, was registered in the United States in 2008 to control diseases caused by Oomycete pathogens, such as Phytophthora capsici, on cucurbit and solanaceous vegetables. The main objective of this study was to determine baseline sensitivity to fluopicolide in isolates of P capsici from the southeastern and midwestern United States. A total of 69 isolates from Florida (14 isolates), Georgia (14 isolates), Michigan (24 isolates), North Carolina (3 isolates), and South Carolina (17 isolates) that had not been previously exposed to fluopicolide were grown on fungicide-amended medium to determine sensitivity of mycelia, sporangia, and zoospores to the fungicide. All isolates of P capsici tested (range of 54 to 69 isolates per assay) were sensitive to fluopicolide in all four assays. The median EC(50) fluopicolide concentration was 0.22, 2.08, 0.048, and 0.10 mg/liter in the mycelia] growth, zoospore germination, sporangia production, and zoospore production assays, respectively. For mycelial growth and zoospore germination, isolates from Michigan had a higher mean EC(50) value than isolates from the four southeastern states. This is the first report of variation in baseline sensitivity to a fungicide by P capsici isolates from different regions of the United States. In the sporangia production and zoospore production assays, isolates from different states did not differ in sensitivity. Single rates of fluopicolide were tested with additional isolates to validate discriminatory rates for monitoring sensitivity. A concentration of 0.3 or 1.0 mg/liter is recommended for mycelial growth, and 0.1 mg/liter is recommended for sporangia and zoospore production.									8	0	0	8	0	8			0191-2917			WOS:000296109700011

To the best of our knowledge, incoherent light source based rapid photothermal processing (RPP) was used for the first time to anneal glass-clad silicon core optical fibers. X-ray diffraction examination of the silicon core showed a considerable enhancement in the length and amount of single crystallinity post-annealing. Further, shifts in the Raman frequency of the silicon in the optical fiber core that were present in the as-drawn fibers were removed following the RPP treatment. Such results indicate that the RPP treatment increases the local crystallinity and therefore assists in the reduction of the local stresses in the core, leading to more homogenous fibers. The dark current-voltage characteristics of annealed silicon optical fiber diodes showed lower leakage current than the diodes based on as-drawn fibers. Photons in UV and vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) regions play a very important role in improving the bulk and carrier transport properties of RPP-treated silicon optical fibers, and the resultant annealing permits a path forward to in situ enhancement of the structure and properties of these new crystalline core optical fibers.

However, despite numerous studies examining the kinetics of controlled release, the biological behavior of such nanoparticles remains poorly understood, particularly with respect to endocytosis and intracellular trafficking. We synthesized polyethylenimine-decorated polymer nanospheres (ca 100-250 nm) of the type commonly used for drug release and used correlated electron microscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy, and relaxometry to track endocytosis in neural cells. These capabilities provide insight into how polyethylenimine mediates the entry of nanoparticles into neural cells and show that polymer nanosphere uptake Involves three distinct steps, namely, plasma membrane attachment, fluid-phase as well as dathrin- and caveolin-independent endocytosis, and progressive accumulation in membrane-bound intracellular vesicles. These findings provide detailed insight into how the Intracellular delivery of nanoparticles is mediated by polyethylenimine, which is presently the most commonly used nonviral gene transfer agent This fundamental knowledge may also assist in the preparation of next-generation nonviral vectors.									40	1	0	10	0	40			1936-0851			WOS:000297143300021	22003894

However, this behavior is still subject to some controversy since its physical origins are not well understood. Using atomistic simulations, we show that the capacitance of slit-shaped nanopores in contact with room-temperature ionic liquids exhibits a U-shaped scaling behavior In pores with widths from 0.75 to 1.26 nm. The left branch of the capacitance scaling curve directly corresponds to the anomalous capacitance Increase and thus reproduces the experimental observations. The right branch of the curve Indirectly agrees with experimental findings that so far have received little attention. The overall U-shaped scaling behavior provides insights on the origins of the difficulty in experimentally observing the pore-width-dependent capacitance. We establish a theoretical framework for understanding the capacitance of electrical double layers in nanopores and provide mechanistic details into the origins of the observed scaling behavior. The framework highlights the critical role of "ion solvation" in controlling pore capacitance and the importance of choosing anion/cation couples carefully for optimal energy storage in a given pore system.									90	1	0	4	0	90			1936-0851			WOS:000297143300066	22017626

However, no comprehensive quantitative summaries of interests validity research have been conducted to substantiate claims for or against the use of interests. To help address this gap, we conducted a meta-analysis of relations between interests and employee performance and turnover using data from 74 studies and 141 independent samples. Overall validity estimates (corrected for measurement error in the criterion but not for range restriction) for single interest scales were.14 for job performance,.26 for training performance, -.19 for turnover intentions, and -.15 for actual turnover. Several factors appeared to moderate interest-criterion relations. For example, validity estimates were larger when interests were theoretically relevant to the work performed in the target job. The type of interest scale also moderated validity, such that corrected validities were larger for scales designed to assess interests relevant to a particular job or vocation (e. g.,.23 for job performance) than for scales designed to assess a single, job-relevant realistic, investigative, artistic, social, enterprising, or conventional (i.e., RIASEC) interest (. 10) or a basic interest (. 11). Finally, validity estimates were largest when studies used multiple interests for prediction, either by using a single job or vocation focused scale (which tend to tap multiple interests) or by using a regression-weighted composite of several RIASEC or basic interest scales. Overall, the results suggest that vocational interests may hold more promise for predicting employee performance and turnover than researchers may have thought.									32	0	0	1	1	33			0021-9010			WOS:000296914800004	21744941

Adding anthrahydroquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AH(2)QDS) increased the extent of xylose utilization by 56% and hydrogen molar yield by 24-37%. Enhanced hydrogen molar yield correlated with increased xylose utilization and increases in the acetate/butyrate product ratio. An electron balance indicated that AH(2)QDS shifted the electrons from the butyric acid pathway (NADH-dependent pathway) to the acetic acid pathway (non-NADH-dependent pathway), putatively creating a surplus of reducing equivalents that were then available for hydrogen production. These data demonstrate that hydrogen yield and xylose utilization can be manipulated by amending redox active molecules into growing cultures. This will impact biohydrogen/biofuel production by allowing physiological manipulations of growing cells for increased (or decreased) output of selected metabolites using amendments that are not consumed during the reactions. Although the current yield increases are small, they suggest a target for cellular alterations. In addition, increased xylose utilization will be critical to the fermentation of pretreated lignocellulosic feedstocks, which may have higher xylose content.									10	2	0	7	0	12			0175-7598			WOS:000296779200019	21947605

Efforts to characterize and further enhance polylactide-based systems using molecular simulations have to this point been hindered by the lack of accurate atomistic models for the polymer. Thus, we present force field parameters specifically suited for molecular modeling of PLA. The model, which we refer to as PLAFF3, is based on a combination of the OPLS and CHARMM force fields, with modifications to bonded and nonbonded parameters. Dihedral angle parameters were adjusted to reproduce DFT data using newly developed CMAP dihedral cross terms, and the model was further adjusted to reproduce experimentally resolved crystal structure conformations, melt density, volume expansivity, and the glass transition temperature of PLA. We recommend the use of PLAFF3 in modeling PLA in its crystalline or amorphous states and have provided the necessary input files required for the publicly available molecular dynamics code GROMACS.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1549-9618			WOS:000296597300031	22180734

It has been established on the basis of the selectivity parameters in the oxidation of linear and branched alkanes and the kinetic peculiarities of the cyclohexane oxidation that the reaction mechanism includes the formation of HO center dot radicals. The presence of acid (TFA) is the crucial factor in this process, since in the neutral medium, monovanadate is inactive as a catalyst. The role of the acid is explained by the formation of oligovanadates in acidic medium, which exhibit higher catalytic activity compared with the monovanadate. The theoretical DFT calculations that used an oxodivanadate as a model of the catalytically active species revealed that the key factor of the higher activity of oligovanadates is the modification of the reaction mechanism upon the introduction of the second vanadium fragment into the catalyst molecule. As a result, the model divanadate catalyst is more active, by 4.2 kcal/mol (i.e., by a factor of ca. 1200), than the simple monovanadate species. Less energetically demanding routes (H-transfer to the oxo-ligand in the rate-limiting step) are opened for the di(poly)vanadate catalysts but not accessible for the monovanadate catalyst. Moreover, the second vanadium fragment plays the role of a stabilizer of key transition states due to the formation of 6-membered cyclic structures.									50	1	0	1	0	51			2155-5435			WOS:000296598000008

Although several chromosomal loci for SHFLD have been identified, the molecular basis and pathogenesis of most SHFLD cases are unknown. In this study we describe three unrelated kindreds, in which SHFLD segregated with distinct but overlapping duplications in 17p13.3, a region previously linked to SHFLD. In a large three-generation family, the disorder was found to segregate with a 254 kb microduplication; a second microduplication of 527 kb was identified in an affected female and her unaffected mother, and a 430 kb microduplication versus microtriplication was identified in three affected members of a multi-generational family. These findings, along with previously published data, suggest that one locus responsible for this form of SHFLD is located within a 173 kb overlapping critical region, and that the copy gains are incompletely penetrant.

We evaluate the relevance of these characteristics for neptunium(V) (Np(V)) sorption/desorption on goethite using a 34-day flow-cell experiment and kinetic modeling. Based on experimental results, the Np(V) desorption rate is much slower than the (ad) sorption rate, and appears to decrease over the course of the experiment. The best model fit with a minimum number of fitting parameters was achieved with a multi-reaction model including (1) an equilibrium Freundlich site (site 1), (2) a kinetically-controlled, consecutive, first-order site (site 2), and (3) a parameter psi(2,de), which characterizes the desorption rate on site 2 based on a concept related to transition state theory (TST). This approach allows us to link differences in adsorption and desorption kinetics to changes in overall reaction pathways, without assuming different adsorption and desorption affinities (hysteresis) or irreversible sorption behavior a priori. Using modeling as a heuristic tool, we determined that aging processes are relevant. However, hysteresis and irreversible sorption behavior can be neglected within the time-frame (desorption over 32 days) and chemical solution conditions evaluated in the flow-cell experiment. In this system, desorption reactions are very slow, but they are not irreversible. Hence, our data do not justify an assumption of irreversible Np(V) sorption to goethite in transport models, which effectively limits the relevance of colloid-facilitated Np(V) transport to near-field environments. However, slow Np(V) desorption behavior may also lead to a continuous contaminant source term when metals are sorbed to bulk mineral phases. Additional long-term experiments are recommended to definitely rule out irreversible Np(V) sorption behavior at very low surface loadings and environmentally-relevant time-scales.

Compounds (1) and (2) are isostructural, crystallizing in space group P2(1)/c and having lattice parameters of a=6.6330(13) angstrom, b=8.6250(17) angstrom, c=14.680(3) angstrom, beta=93.46(3)degrees and a=6.4970(13) angstrom, b=8.4180(17) angstrom, c=14.177(3) angstrom, beta=94.35(3)degrees, respectively. Compound (3) crystallizes in P-1 with lattice parameters of a=6.4684(13) angstrom, b=8.4513(17) angstrom, c=14.881(3) angstrom, alpha=101.21(3)degrees, beta=93.96(3)degrees, gamma=90.67(3)degrees. While similar in their axis lengths, (3) differs greatly in structure and formulation from (1) and (2).

Neomycin enhances extracellular matrix stability of glutaraldehyde crosslinked bioprosthetic heart valves								JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART B-APPLIED BIOMATERIALS				99B	2			217	229		10.1002/jbm.b.31889			NOV 2011	2011	Glutaraldehyde (GLUT) crosslinked porcine aortic heart valves are continued to be extensively used in heart valve replacement surgeries. GLUT does not crosslink glycos-aminoglycans in the tissue and we have demonstrated that GAG loss is associated with tissue degeneration. In this study, we examined the ability of neomycin to enhance GLUT crosslinking to stabilize GAGs, as well as provide evidence of improved functional integrity. Neomycin enhanced GLUT crosslinked (NG) leaflets exposed to collagenase and elastase enzymes exhibited an increased resistance to proteolytic degradation. Furthermore, NG leaflets exhibited small but significant increases in collagen denaturation temperatures when compared to that of standard GLUT crosslinked BHVs. NG leaflets subjected to storage, accelerated cyclic fatigue, and in vitro enzyme mediated GAG degradation revealed improved GAG stabilization versus standard GLUT crosslinked valves, which sustained substantial decreases in GAG content. Ultrastructural analysis using transmission electron microscopy qualitatively confirmed NG leaflets preserved GAGs after enzymatic degradation. Biomechanical analyses demonstrated that NG leaflets were functionally similar to GLUT tissues but were slightly stiffer under both planar biaxial tension and under flexure. Interestingly, after GAGase treatment, GLUT tissues showed increased areal compliance and reduced hysteresis, while NG leaflets were unchanged. Collectively, NG cross-linking functionally insulated the tissue from GAG digestion, and imparted modest additional matrix stiffness but maintained tissue hysteresis properties.

Association between deletion size and important phenotypes expands the genomic region of interest in Phelan-McDermid syndrome (22q13 deletion syndrome)								JOURNAL OF MEDICAL GENETICS				48	11			761	766		10.1136/jmedgenet-2011-100225			NOV 2011	2011	Background The clinical features of Phelan-McDermid syndrome (also known as 22q13 deletion syndrome) are highly variable and include hypotonia, speech and other developmental delays, autistic traits and mildly dysmorphic features. Patient deletion sizes are also highly variable, prompting this genotype-phenotype association study.Methods Terminal deletion breakpoints were identified for 71 individuals in a patient cohort using a custom-designed high-resolution oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridisation platform with a resolution of 100 bp.Results Patient deletion sizes were highly variable, ranging from 0.22 to 9.22 Mb, and no common breakpoint was observed. SHANK3, the major candidate gene for the neurologic features of the syndrome, was deleted in all cases. Sixteen features (neonatal hypotonia, neonatal hyporeflexia, neonatal feeding problems, speech/language delay, delayed age at crawling, delayed age at walking, severity of developmental delay, male genital anomalies, dysplastic toenails, large or fleshy hands, macrocephaly, tall stature, facial asymmetry, full brow, atypical reflexes and dolichocephaly) were found to be significantly associated with larger deletion sizes, suggesting the role of additional genes or regulatory regions proximal to SHANK3. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) were found to have smaller deletion sizes (median deletion size of 3.39 Mb) than those without ASDs (median deletion size 6.03 Mb, p=0.0144). This may reflect the difficulty in diagnosing ASDs in individuals with severe developmental delay.Conclusions This genotype-phenotype analysis explains some of the phenotypic variability in the syndrome and identifies new genomic regions with a high likelihood for causing important developmental phenotypes such as speech delay.									37	2	0	29	0	39			0022-2593			WOS:000296198800007	21984749

Since 1985, the share of U.S. depository institution assets held by credit unions has nearly doubled, and the average (inflation-adjusted) size of credit unions has increased over 600%. We use a local-linear estimator, dimesion-reduction techniques, and bootstrap methods to estimate and make inference about ray scale and expansion-path scale economies. We find substantial evidence of increasing returns to scale among credit unions of all sizes, suggesting that further consolidation and growth among credit unions are likely.									16	0	0	0	0	16			0034-6535			WOS:000296331900017

A Computationally Efficient, Consistent Bootstrap for Inference with Non-parametric DEA Estimators								COMPUTATIONAL ECONOMICS				38	4			483	515		10.1007/s10614-010-9217-z			NOV 2011	2011	We develop a tractable, consistent bootstrap algorithm for inference about Farrell-Debreu efficiency scores estimated by non-parametric data envelopment analysis (DEA) methods. The algorithm allows for very general situations where the distribution of the inefficiencies in the input-output space may be heterogeneous. Computational efficiency and tractability are achieved by avoiding the complex double-smoothing procedure in the algorithm proposed by Kneip et al. (Econometric Theory 24:1663-1697, 2008). In particular, we avoid technical difficulties in the earlier algorithm associated with smoothed estimates of a density with unknown, nonlinear, multivariate bounded support requiring complicated reflection methods. The new procedure described here is relatively simple and easy to implement: for particular values of a pair of smoothing parameters, the computational complexity is the same as the (inconsistent) naive bootstrap. The resulting computational speed allows the bootstrap to be iterated in order to optimize the smoothing parameters. From a practical viewpoint, only standard packages for computing DEA efficiency estimates, i.e., solving linear problems, are required for implementation. The performance of the method in finite samples is illustrated through some simulated examples.									10	0	0	0	0	10			0927-7099			WOS:000295981900003

Mineral Concentration of Broccoli Florets in Relation to Year of Cultivar Release								CROP SCIENCE				51	6			2721	2727		10.2135/cropsci2010.09.0556			NOV 2011	2011	It has been proposed that crop improvement through directed plant breeding has resulted in decreases in nutrient concentrations of harvested components over time. A few field studies wherein cultivars released over a period of years are evaluated for nutrient content provide the best evidence for nutrient changes over time; however, no such studies have been conducted with vegetable crops. To accomplish this with broccoli (Brassica oleracea L.), we grew 14 cultivars released over 50 yr in two field trials, and harvested florets were assayed for mineral concentration by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy. Results indicated significant cultivar differences in floret concentrations of Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, Na, P, and Zn, but not of K, Mn, Mo, or S. With most minerals, there was no clear relationship between concentration and release year. Although the oldest cultivar exhibited some of the higher mineral concentrations, from 1975 to the present no significant changes appear to have occurred. Head mass was negatively correlated with concentrations of most minerals, but head mass was not correlated with year of release. We propose it most relevant to examine mineral nutrient changes for cultivars grown since 1975 when broccoli phenotypes changed dramatically and the vegetable grew in prominence as a component in the U. S. diet. Results provide a guide for mineral levels in broccoli that should be maintained as other characteristics are manipulated in the future.									18	0	0	15	0	18			0011-183X			WOS:000295839200043

On the electrical conductivity of microbial nanowires and biofilms								ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE				4	11			4366	4379		10.1039/c1ee01753e			NOV 2011	2011	Dissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria (DMRB), such as Geobacter and Shewanella spp., occupy a distinct metabolic niche in which they acquire energy by coupling oxidation of organic fuels with reduction of insoluble extracellular electron acceptors (i.e., minerals). Their unique extracellular electron transfer (EET) capabilities extend to reduction of anodes (electrodes maintained at sufficiently positive potentials) on which they form persistent, electric current generating biofilms. One hypothesis describing the mechanism of EET by Geobacter and Shewanella spp. involves superexchange in which electrons are conducted by a succession of electron transfer reactions among redox proteins associated with the outer cell membranes, aligned along pilus-like filaments (e.g. pili), and/or throughout the extracellular matrix. Here we present theory, previously developed to describe superexchange within abiotic redox polymers, to describe superexchange within DMRB biofilms grown on anodes. We show that this theory appears to apply to recent ex situ measurements of electrical conductivity by individual pilus-like filaments of S. oneidensis MR-1 and G. sulfurreducens DL1, referred to as microbial nanowires. Microbial nanowires have received much recent attention because they are thought by some to impart electrical conductivity to DMRB biofilms and because of the prospect of microbe-produced conductive nanomaterials. We also show that this theory appears to apply to preliminary in situ demonstration of electrical conductivity of an anode-grown G. sulfurreducens DL1 biofilm. Based on these results we suggest a role for nanowires of S. oneidensis and G. sulfurreducens in biofilm conductivity.									105	0	0	45	0	105			1754-5692			WOS:000296248100001

These fibers can be considered as prototypes for advanced high strength/high-stiffness fibers like Kevlar(A (R)), Twaron(A (R)), New Star(A (R)), etc. While modeling these fibers, it was taken into account that they are essentially crystalline materials consisting of stacks of sheets, with each sheet containing an array of nearly parallel hydrogen-bonded molecules/chains. The inter-sheet bonding, on the other hand, was considered as mainly being of van der Waals or p-electron character. The effects of various deviations of the PPTA fiber structure from that of the perfectly crystalline structure (i.e., microstructural/topological defects) on the material's mechanical properties are then considered. The results obtained show that while the presence of these defects decreases all the mechanical properties of PPTA fibers, specific properties display an increased level of sensitivity to the presence of certain defects. For example, longitudinal tensile properties are found to be most sensitive to the presence of chain ends, in-sheet transverse properties to the presence of chain misalignments, while cross-sheet transverse properties are found to be most affected by the presence of sheet stacking faults.									17	1	0	0	1	18			1059-9495			WOS:000295940500008

However, both have never been directly compared. Methods We compared HRV in AN (n = 21) and in IBS (n = 21) (all females) with 42 healthy female control subjects who were matched for age and in IBS to body mass index (BMI). Recovery periods between different cardiac load tests were compared with baseline recordings and tilt test to estimate time [mean successive difference (MSD)] and frequency domain (Goldberger dimension, frequency of HF peak location and HF power, log HF power) values and to assess general reactivity of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Key Results Significantly longer inter-beat intervals (IBIs) in AN patients and lower values of MSD in IBS patients were found in comparison with respective controls; both were independent from experimental conditions and are found in baseline recordings only. Both effects were independent of age and BMI. We also demonstrate a significant relationship between age, BMI and some HRV parameters. Conclusions & Inferences Opposite autonomic patterns were found in AN and IBS: stronger vagal withdrawal in IBS and weaker vagal inhibition in AN patients. Records made at rest and without any autonomic load may be representative for assessment of ANS function. Age and BMI should be taken into consideration during assessment of HRV data.									5	0	0	2	0	5			1350-1925	1365-2982		WOS:000296061000002	21917084

Special attention is paid to the mathematical consequence of the shear-dependent fluid viscosity for the Stokes flow and the velocity-dependent effective viscosity for the Darcy flow. Motivated by the physical setting, we consider the case where only flow rates are specified on the inflow and outflow boundaries in both subdomains. We recast the coupled Stokes-Darcy system as a reduced matching problem on the interface using a mortar space approach. We prove a number of properties of the nonlinear interface operator associated with the reduced problem, which directly yield the existence, uniqueness and regularity of a variational solution to the system. We further propose and analyze a numerical algorithm based on mortar finite elements for the interface problem and conforming finite elements for the subdomain problems. Optimal a priori error estimates are established for the interface and subdomain problems, and a number of compatibility conditions for the finite element spaces used are discussed. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the algorithm and to compare two treatments of the defective boundary conditions. (C) 2011 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The Role of Polymer Nanolayer Architecture on the Separation Performance of Anion-Exchange Membrane Adsorbers: I. Protein Separations								BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOENGINEERING				108	11			2645	2653		10.1002/bit.23221			NOV 2011	2011	This contribution describes the preparation of strong anion-exchange membranes with higher protein binding capacities than the best commercial resins. Quaternary amine (Q-type) anion-exchange membranes were prepared by grafting polyelectrolyte nanolayers from the surfaces of macroporous membrane supports. A focus of this study was to better understand the role of polymer nanolayer architecture on protein binding. Membranes were prepared with different polymer chain graft densities using a newly developed surface-initiated polymerization protocol designed to provide uniform and variable chain spacing. Bovine serum albumin and immunoglobulin G were used to measure binding capacities of proteins with different size. Dynamic binding capacities of IgG were measured to evaluate the impact of polymer chain density on the accessibility of large size protein to binding sites within the polyelectrolyte nanolayer under flow conditions. The dynamic binding capacity of IgG increased nearly linearly with increasing polymer chain density, which suggests that the spacing between polymer chains is sufficient for IgG to access binding sites all along the grafted polymer chains. Furthermore, the high dynamic binding capacity of IgG (>130 mg/mL) was independent of linear flow velocity, which suggests that the mass transfer of IgG molecules to the binding sites occurs primarily via convection. Overall, this research provides clear evidence that the dynamic binding capacities of large biologics can be higher for well-designed macroporous membrane adsorbers than commercial membrane or resin ion-exchange products. Specifically, using controlled polymerization leads to anion-exchange membrane adsorbers with high binding capacities that are independent of flow rate, enabling high throughput. Results of this work should help to accelerate the broader implementation of membrane adsorbers in bioprocess purification steps. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2011; 108: 2645-2653.

DNA and Virus Separations								BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOENGINEERING				108	11			2654	2660		10.1002/bit.23222			NOV 2011	2011	The surface-initiated polymerization protocol developed in part I was used to prepare strong anion-exchange membranes with variable polymer chain graft densities and degrees of polymerization for DNA and virus particle separations. A focus of part II was to evaluate the role of polymer nanolayer architecture on DNA and virus binding. Salmon sperm-DNA (SS-DNA) was used as model nucleic acid to measure the dynamic-binding capacities at 10% breakthrough. The dynamic-binding capacity increases linearly with increasing poly ([2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]trimethylammonium chloride) chain density up to the highest chain density used in this study. The new membranes yielded threefold higher SS-DNA-binding capacity (30 mg/mL) than a leading commercial membrane with the same functional group chemistry. Elution of bound DNA yielded a sharp peak, and resulted in a 13-fold increase relative to the feed concentration. This concentration effect further demonstrates the highly favorable transport properties of the newly designed Q-type membranes. However, unlike findings in part I on protein binding, SS-DNA binding was not fully reversible. Minute virus of mice (MVM) was used as model virus to evaluate the virus clearance performance of newly designed Q-type membranes. Log reduction of virus (LRV) of MVM increased with increasing polymer chain density. Membranes exhibited >4.5 LRV for the given MVM impurity load and may be capable of higher LRV values, as the MVM concentration in the flow-through fraction of these samples was below the limit of detection of the assay.

J	Terry, William C.								Geographic limits to global labor market flexibility: The human resources paradox of the cruise industry								GEOFORUM				42	6			660	670		10.1016/j.geoforum.2011.06.006			NOV 2011	2011	The cruise industry enjoys arguably the most flexible and globalized of all labor markets. Yet, in an apparent paradox, cruise lines face a potential labor shortage, despite the fact that the bulk of their labor is sourced from the Global South where a large labor surplus would seemingly make recruitment a simple process. This paper examines this paradox in greater detail with a focus on the tension that exists between the industry's demand for a flexible labor force, and the need for workers who maintain the skills required of a cruise ship job. It is argued that the contemporary geography of global labor recruitment is constrained by the particular political, economic and cultural circumstances of individual source countries that make certain cohorts less attractive or available as a workforce. In practice the need for skill and flexibility are not always reconcilable and cruise lines have found that there is a geographic limit to labor market flexibility. The article is based on interviews with various stakeholders involved in either working on cruise ships or in recruiting workers. Special emphasis is placed on Filipino cruise ship workers and labor recruiters as a means to discuss labor recruitment for the entire industry. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The SLS method is based on the unified momentum equation framework in which the solid-fluid interactions are modeled by introducing a solid body force term and a solid-fluid interfacial force term into the Navier-Stokes equation. The key idea of the SLS method is that the deformation of the solid body is no longer tracked using a Lagrangian mesh. Instead, the solid body is tracked by introducing a reference coordinate for describing the reference state of the solid body and by introducing three dynamic level set functions on the Cartesian coordinate and one static level set functions on the reference coordinate. The SLS method is easy to implement and addresses several challenges in the simulation of FSIs in which a fixed Cartesian mesh is used for fluid flow and a Lagrangian mesh is used for tracking the solid deformation. The effectiveness of the SLS method is demonstrated by studying two FSI problems. The method is suitable for studying a wide range of problems in microfluidics, e.g., manipulation of cells in confined space and ink-jet printing of biological samples.									9	0	0	0	1	9			1613-4982			WOS:000296013400006		
J	Chen, Zhichao; Li, Yinxiao; Birchfield, Stanley T.								Visual detection of lintel-occluded doors by integrating multiple cues using a data-driven Markov chain Monte Carlo process								ROBOTICS AND AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS				59	11			966	976		10.1016/j.robot.2011.06.013			NOV 2011	2011	We present an algorithm to detect doors in images. The key to the algorithm's success is its fusion of multiple visual cues, including standard cues (color, texture, and intensity edges) as well as several novel ones (concavity, the kick plate, the vanishing point, and the intensity profile of the gap below the door). We use the Adaboost algorithm to determine the linear weighting of the various cues. Formulated as a maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) problem, a multi-cue functional is minimized by a data-driven Markov chain Monte Carlo (DDMCMC) process that arrives at a solution that is shown empirically to be near the global minimum. Intensity edge information is used in the importance probability distribution to drive the Markov chain dynamics in order to achieve a speedup of several orders of magnitude over traditional jump diffusion methods. Unlike previous approaches, the algorithm does not rely upon range information and yet is able to handle complex environments irrespective of lighting conditions, reflections, wall or door color, or the relative orientation between the camera and the door. Moreover, the algorithm is designed to detect doors for which the lintel is occluded, which often occurs when the camera on a mobile robot is low to the ground. The versatility of the algorithm is tested on a large database of images collected in a wide variety of conditions, on which it achieves approximately 90% detection rate with a low false positive rate. Versions of the algorithm are shown for calibrated and uncalibrated camera systems. Additional experiments demonstrate the suitability of the algorithm for near-real-time applications using a mobile robot equipped with off-the-shelf cameras. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J	Curry, Erin; Safranski, Timothy J.; Pratt, Scott L.								Differential expression of porcine sperm microRNAs and their association with sperm morphology and motility								THERIOGENOLOGY				76	8			1532	1539		10.1016/j.theriogenology.2011.06.025			NOV 2011	2011	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in nearly every biological process examined to date, but little is known of the identity or function of miRNA in sperm cells or their potential involvement in spermatogenesis. The objective was to identify differences in miRNA expression between normal porcine sperm samples and those exhibiting high percentages of morphological abnormalities or low motility. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed on sperm RNA to compare expression levels of 10 specific miRNAs that are predicted to target genes that code for proteins involved in spermatogenesis, sperm structure, motility, or metabolism. There were increases in the expression of four miRNAs, let-7a, -7d, -7e, and miR-22, in the abnormal group (P < 0.05), whereas miR-15b was decreased compared to controls (P < 0.05). Two miRNAs, let-7d and let-7e, were increased in the low motility group when compared to controls (P < 0.05). Bioinformatic analyses revealed that messenger RNA targets of the differentially expressed miRNAs encode proteins previously described to play roles in sperm function. Although the precise role of miRNA in sperm remains to be determined, their changes as associated with morphology and motility signify a critical biological function. Perhaps they are remnants of spermatogenesis, stored for a later role in fertilization, or are delivered to the oocyte to influence early embryonic development. Although there is no single cause of male infertility, the identification of miRNAs associated with sperm motility, structural integrity, or metabolism could lead to the development of a microarray or real time-based diagnostic assay to provide an assessment of male fertility status.

The addition of DTT did not negatively affect the purification of Rha and Nar, but greatly simplified the purification steps due to its strong capability of separating the Rha from Nar. The novel HPLC method enabled simultaneous measurement and differentiation of the Rha and the Nar with the naringin as the substrate. These improvements resulted in an efficient purification of the homogenous Rha with an estimated molecular weight of 87 kDa. Otherwise, Rha could not be extracted with enough purity even by the combination of sulphate precipitation, ion exchange chromatography and gel filtration chromatography. The modified methods have ensured efficient purification of the Rha from A. niger naringinase. This study provides a powerful and simple procedure to separate and purify the Rha of Nar, which will facilitate further more in-depth studies of these enzymes, as well as their industrial applications.									2	3	0	1	0	5			0959-3993	1573-0972		WOS:000295506000007		
J	Venkataraman, Lavanya; Ramamurthi, Anand								Induced Elastic Matrix Deposition Within Three-Dimensional Collagen Scaffolds								TISSUE ENGINEERING PART A				17	21-22			2879	2889		10.1089/ten.tea.2010.0749			NOV 2011	2011	The structural stability of a cyclically distending elastic artery and the healthy functioning of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) within are maintained by the presence of an intact elastic matrix and its principal protein, elastin. The accelerated degradation of the elastic matrix, which occurs in several vascular diseases, coupled with the poor ability of adult SMCs to regenerate lost elastin, can therefore adversely impact vascular homeostasis. Similarly, efforts to tissue engineer elastic matrix structures are constrained by our inability to induce adult cells to synthesize tropoelastin precursors and to crosslink them into architectural mimics of native elastic matrices, especially within engineered constructs where SMCs/fibroblasts primarily deposit collagen in abundance. In this study, we have shown that transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta 1) and hyaluronan oligomers (HA-o) synergistically enhance elastic matrix deposition by adult rat aortic SMCs (RASMCs) seeded within nonelastogenic, statically loaded three-dimensional gels, composed of nonelastogenic type-I collagen. While there was no substantial increase in production of tropoelastin within experimental cases compared to the nonadditive control cultures over 3 weeks, we observed significant increases in matrix elastin deposition; soluble matrix elastin in constructs that received the lowest doses of TGF-beta 1 with respective doses of HA-o, and insoluble matrix at the highest doses that corresponded with elevated lysyl-oxidase protein quantities. However, despite elastogenic induction, overall matrix yields remained poor in all experimental cases. At all provided doses, the factors reduced the production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-9, especially the active enzyme, though MMP-2 levels were lowered only in constructs cultured with the higher doses of TGF-beta 1. Immuno-fluorescence showed elastic fibers within the collagen constructs to be discontinuous, except at the edges of the constructs. Von Kossa staining revealed no calcific deposits in any of the cases. This study confirms the benefits of utilizing TGF-beta 1 and HA-o in inducing matrix elastin synthesis by adult RASMCs over nonadditive controls, within a collagenous environment, that is not inherently conducive to elastogenesis.									15	0	0	13	0	15			1937-3341			WOS:000296619500027	21702719

Transparent tetragonal bipyramid crystals, tens of micrometers in size, with a refractive index closely matched to that of the glass matrix were formed using a two-step heat treatment. Nucleation- and growth-like curves for this crystal phase were determined using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The crystalline phases present in the glass ceramics were identified via x-ray diffraction as a function of heat treatment. The lowest absorption coefficient of glass ceramic is approximately 0.5/cm in the near infrared region (1.2 to 2.8 mu m). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

If so, what factors influence the quality risk? Progress addressing these deceptively simple questions has been hindered by the challenges associated with (1) difficulties in controlling for a wide range of factors that may potentially affect quality risk in offshore manufacturing and (2) the lack of available measures that are consistent across geographic regions. This paper contributes to the academic discourse by empirically assessing differences in quality risk across domestic and offshore plants in a setting that naturally controls for many confounding factors. Specifically, we employ a sample of 30 pairs of regulated drug manufacturing plants in the U.S. mainland and Puerto Rico matched both by parent firm and by product standard industrial code (SIC). Using a plant-level measure of quality risk that is measurement invariant, our findings indicate that Puerto Rican plants operate with a significantly higher quality risk than matching plants operated by the same firm located in the mainland U.S., on average. This finding persists above and beyond potentially important factors, such as geographic distance and the local population's general and industry-specific skills. Thus, challenges related to the transfer and maintenance of the knowledge required to operate with a low quality risk across non-geographic distance are left as the most plausible explanatory factors. Practically, our research highlights the need for manufacturing firms to carefully consider increased quality risk associated with the offshoring of production, particularly with regard to process-sensitive products like drugs. From a policy standpoint, our study highlights the need for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to continue to intensify its inspection focus on international manufacturing. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Product recalls due to safety hazards entail societal costs, such as property damage, injury, and sometimes death. For firms, the related external failure costs are many, including the costs of recalling the product, providing a remedy, meeting the legal liability, and repairing damage to the firm's reputation. The recent spate of product recalls has shifted attention from why products are recalled to why it takes so long to recall a defective product that poses a safety hazard. To address this, our research subjects to empirical scrutiny the time to recall and its relationship with recall strategies, source of the defect and supply chain position of the recalling firm. We develop and verify our conceptual arguments in the U.S. toy industry by analyzing over 500 product recalls during a 15-year period (1993-2008). The empirical results indicate that the time to recall, as measured by difference between product recall announcement date and product first sold date, is associated with (1) the recall strategy (preventive vs. reactive) adopted by the firm, (2) the type of product defect (manufacturing defect vs. design flaw), and (3) the supply chain entity that issues the recall (toy company vs. distributor vs. retailer). Our results provide cues that could trigger a firm's recognition of factors that increase the time to recall. Published by Elsevier B.V.									29	1	0	0	0	30			0272-6963			WOS:000294750200011

Particular attention is given to the identification and characterization of various (inelastic-deformation and energy-dissipation) molecular-level phenomena and processes taking place at the shock front. The results obtained revealed that the shock loading causes a 2-4% (shock strength-dependent) density increase. In addition, an increase in the average coordination number of the silicon atoms is observed along with the creation of smaller Si-O rings. These processes are associated with significant energy absorption and dissipation and are believed to control the blast/ballistic impact mitigation potential of soda-lime glass. This study was also aimed at the determination (via purely computational means) of the shock Hugoniot (i.e., a set of axial stress vs. density/specific-volume vs. internal energy vs. particle velocity vs. temperature) material states obtained in soda-lime glass after the passage of a shock wave of a given strength and on the comparison of the computed results with their experimental counterparts. The availability of a shock Hugoniot is critical for construction of a high deformation-rate, large-strain, high pressure material model which can be used within a continuum-level computational analysis to capture the response of a soda-lime glass-based laminated transparent armor structure (e.g., a military vehicle windshield, door window, etc.) to blast/ballistic impact loading.									11	1	0	0	0	11			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000294064900031

Chang, Yanwei/D-8117-2013				Elevator shaft pressurization for smoke control in tall buildings: The Seattle approach								BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT				46	11			2247	2254		10.1016/j.buildenv.2011.05.007			NOV 2011	2011	CONTAM simulations of both commercial and residential tall building models are conducted in order to study recently adopted Seattle code requirements for elevator shaft pressurization systems. In contrast to the International Building Code (IBC) requirements, the Seattle approach specifies across elevator door pressure minimums and maximums on only four "fire floors" (including one above, and two below, the fire floor). This is accomplished using a minimal pressurization of the entire elevator shaft in conjunction with venting of the four fire floors. The present study adresses the feasibility of calibrating such a system to meet the design objectives in tall buildings (system performance during an actual fire event is not considered). The two building models correspond to 37 story buildings with dual elevator and dual stairwell shafts extending the entire height of the building. Each model is calibrated to experimental data. Simulations are conducted for a variety of ambient temperatures and exterior building door positions. Coupled pressurization of the stairwells is also considered. The system requirements are found to be achievable for both elevator only and coupled elevator and stairwell pressurization systems. However, the observed pressure differences do change with changes in the ambient temperature as well as changes in the ground floor exterior door position. It is therefore recommended that such systems should be calibrated for pressure differences intermediate to the prescribed minimum and maximum values to compensate for changes to the system performance. Providing a relief vent to ambient on any recall floor may also be advisable. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									4	1	0	0	0	4			0360-1323			WOS:000293487400015

In this study we evaluate whether electrical resistivity monitoring data can constrain the hydraulic conductivity, porosity, and dispersivity of a homogenous aquifer within the framework of coupled inversion. We focus on voltage responses from a single set of current electrodes to provide insights into the information content of these measurements and motivate future work in designing optimal surveys for monitoring groundwater transport processes. We have found that even in this simple system two distinct types of tradeoffs exist that could confound the direct estimation of transport parameters. First, different values of porosity and hydraulic conductivity can produce the same plume velocity, thereby leading to identical concentration distributions in the subsurface. In ideal cases this hydrologic non-uniqueness can be resolved by electrical data because electrical resistivity is dependent on both solute concentration and porosity, but this discrimination will only be possible when the rock physics relationship between concentration and resistivity can be accurately determined. The second type of non-uniqueness occurs when different concentration plumes produce equivalent electrical responses. In this case, tradeoffs between plume velocity and dispersivity cause shifts in the position and mass of solute relative to the electrodes that result in equivalent values of subsurface apparent resistivity. This non-uniqueness contributes to poor discriminating power when using an objective function based on the magnitude of voltage changes. However, the problem can be overcome by explicitly recognizing that different information about transport processes is captured by the timing versus magnitude of the electrical response in monitoring data. Though we have investigated a homogenous system, we argue that the insights here can also be applied to the estimation of effective transport parameters for heterogeneous systems.

Conceptually, the biochemistry of NO can be separated into three stages: generation (stage 1), translocation (stage 2), and action (stage 3). In stage 1 the oxygenase domain of NO synthase converts L-arginine to L-citrulline and NO (g). Owing to its short-lived nature, this molecule is converted into a different nitrogen oxide such as NO2, an organonitrosyl such as a nitrosothiol, or a metal nitrosyl such as a heme-nitrosyl, for transportation in stage 2. Each of these derivatives features unique physical characteristics, chemical reactivity, and biological activity. Upon delivery in stage 3, NO exerts its physiological or pathological function by reaction with biomolecules containing redox-active metals or other residues.									41	3	0	18	0	43			1074-5521			WOS:000296597200008	22035790

However, the high dehydriding temperature and irreversibility prevent them from practical application. Attempting to overcome the hardening, several bimetallic borohydrides were synthesized using wet chemistry, high pressure reactive ball milling, and sintering processes. The investigation found that the thermodynamic stability indicated by dehydriding temperature was reduced considerably and the dehydrided bimetallic borohydrides reabsorbed some of hydrogen released, but the full rehydrogenation is still a challenge. Due to the hydrogen inert intermediates formed during dehydrogenation, the long-term reversibility of bimetallic borohydrides is uncertain.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1932-7447			WOS:000296205600054

Waves of this type are typically generated during blast-wave loading or ballistic impact and play a major role in the way blast/ballistic impact loads are introduced into a structure. Hence, the knowledge of their propagation behavior is critical for designing structures with superior blast and impact protection capacities.To validate the computational procedure used, the structured shock-wave analysis is first applied to a homogeneous (i.e. single component) metallic system (commercially pure niobium). Next, the analysis is applied to the aforementioned MMC (in the limit of intermediate to strong shocks) when the contribution of the stress deviator to the total stress state can be neglected. Finally, the computational results are compared with their experimental counterparts available in the open literature in order to validate the dynamic-mixture method used. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Thermodynamics of Nucleic Acid "Shape Readout" by an Aminosugar								BIOCHEMISTRY				50	42			9088	9113		10.1021/bi201077h			OCT 25 2011	2011	Recognition of nucleic acids is important for our understanding of nucleic acid structure as well as for our understanding of nucleic acid protein interactions. In addition to the direct readout mechanisms of nucleic acids such as H-bonding, shape recognition of nucleic acids is being increasingly recognized as playing an equally important role in DNA recognition. Competition dialysis, UV, flourescent intercalator displacement (FID), computational docking, and calorimetry studies were conducted to study the interaction of neomycin with a variety of nucleic acid conformations (shapes). At pH 5.5, the results suggest the following. (1) Neomycin binds three RNA structures [16S A site rRNA, poly(rA).poly(rA), and poly(rA).poly(rU)] with high affinities (K(a) similar to 10(7) M(-1)). (2) The binding of neomycin to A-form GC-rich oligomer d(A(2)G(15)C(15)T(2))(2) has an affinity comparable to those of RNA structures. (3) The binding of neomycin to DNA.RNA hybrids shows a 3-fold variance that can be attributed to their structural differences [for poly(dA).poly(rU), K(a) = 9.4 x 10(6) M(-1) and for poly(rA).poly(dT), K(a) = 3.1 X 10(6) M(-1). (4) The interaction of neomycin with DNA triplex poly(dA).2poly(dT) yields a binding affinity (K(a)) of 2.4 X 10(5) M(-1). (5) Poly(dA-dT)(2) shows the lowest association constant for all nucleic acids studied (K(a) < 10(5)). (6) Neomycin binds to G-quadruplexes with Ka values of similar to 10(4)-10(5) M(-1). (7) Computational studies show that the decrease in major groove width in the B to A transition correlates with increasing neomycin affinity. Neomycin's affinity for various nucleic acid structures can be ranked as follows: RNAs and GC-rich d(A(2)G(15)C(15)T(2))(2) structures > poly(dA).poly(rU) > poly(rA).poly(dT) > T-A-T triplex, G-quadruplex, B-form AT-rich, or GC-rich DNA sequences. The results illustrate the first example of a small molecule-based "shape readout" of different nucleic acid conformations.									41	0	0	27	0	41			0006-2960			WOS:000295898600012	21863895

To our knowledge, this is the first study of the diamagnetism of this model. A special version of this model, called the F model, describes the thermal disordering transition of an orbital antiferromagnet, known as d-density wave, a proposed state for the pseudogap phase of the high-T(c) cuprates. We find that the F model is strongly diamagnetic and the susceptibility may diverge in the high-temperature critical phase with power-law arrow correlations. These results may explain the surprising recent observation of a diverging low-field diamagnetic susceptibility seen in some optimally doped cuprates within the d-density wave model of the pseudogap phase.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0031-9007			WOS:000296984700014	22107569

We also show the method can be efficiently computed by exploiting a connection between this method, its associated penalty method, and the method arising from using grad-div stabilized Taylor-Hood elements. Finally, we give numerical examples which verify the theory and demonstrate the effectiveness of the scheme. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Miller, Shelie/B-8177-2015				Modeling nitrogen loss from switchgrass agricultural systems								BIOMASS & BIOENERGY				35	10			4381	4389		10.1016/j.biombioe.2011.08.009			OCT 15 2011	2011	A water quality modeling study was conducted to determine and compare nitrogen loss from water flow to surface water and ground water from agricultural systems growing switchgrass and cotton in the southeastern USA. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to replicate field conditions observed at switchgrass research plots at Pee Dee Research and Educational Center at Florence, South Carolina. The plot scale modeling suggested that in the early years of growth there is significant nitrogen loss from switchgrass to streamflow and groundwater but the loss is significantly less as the switchgrass matures. During the second year of growth the modeled nitrogen loss from switchgrass was approximately 50% that of cotton. The long term nitrogen loss over the lifetime of switchgrass was approximately 10% that of cotton. The results also indicate that the use of computational models to quantify nitrogen fluxes in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of agricultural systems growing switchgrass gives a more accurate representation of the system than using constant emission factors.

The SCS product consists of mixtures of Ce-doped Gd2SiO5, Gd-4.67(SiO4)(3)O, and Gd2O3, whose relative concentrations depend on the amount of SiO2 in the precursor mixture; the synthesis of GSO:Ce was obtained with a reduction by 30% of the SiO2 content. Accordingly, this is the brightest material produced, with a photoluminescence signal that is comparable to that obtained from the bulk sample. Thermoluminescence (TL) results showed a considerably lower concentration of trapping defects in the nanoparticles than in the bulk sample. A previous study [E. G. Yukihara, L. G. Jacobsohn, M. W. Blair, B. L. Bennett, S. C. Tornga, and R. E. Muenchausen, J. Lumin. 130, 2309-2316 (2010)] reporting a comparison between photoluminescence and scintillation measurements, coupled to the TL characterization, suggests that surfaces play a major role in decreasing the scintillation efficiency of the nanoparticles. These results show that it is possible to prepare relatively bright scintillator powders using the SCS method. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

Apoptosis of lung carcinoma cells induced by a flexible optical fiber-based cold microplasma								BIOSENSORS & BIOELECTRONICS				28	1			333	338		10.1016/j.bios.2011.07.039			OCT 15 2011	2011	Atmospheric pressure plasmas have been used as a therapy for cancer. However, the fairly large size and rigidity of present plasma-delivery systems obstructs the precise treatment of tumors in harder-to-reach internal organs such as the lungs, pancreas, and duodenum. In order to improve the targeted delivery of plasmas a highly flexible microplasma jet device is fabricated using a hollow-core optical fiber with an inner diameter of either 15 mu m, 55 mu m, or 200 mu m. Described herein, based on this device, are results on lung carcinoma therapy using a microplasma cancer endoscope. Despite the small inner diameter and the low gas flow rate, the generated plasma jets are shown to be sufficiently effective to induce apoptosis, but not necrosis, in both cultured mouse lung carcinoma and fibroblast cells. Further, the lung carcinoma cells were found to be more sensitive to plasma treatment than the fibroblast cells based on the overall plasma dose conditions. This work enables directed cancer therapies using on highly flexible and precise hollow optical fiber-based plasma device and offers enhancements to microplasma cancer endoscopy using an improved method of plasma targeting and delivery.

The effects of molecular weight distribution and sample preparation on matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometric analysis of petroleum macromolecules								RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY				25	19			2799	2808		10.1002/rcm.5166			OCT 15 2011	2011	To date there have been no systematic, quantitative investigations of the effect of sample preparation on the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI) mass spectrometry response for polydisperse systems. To this end, the interrelationships between sample preparation, analyte molecular weight distribution (MWD) and solubility, and signal response were investigated for mixtures of alkylated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) oligomers, the constituents of petroleum pitch that serve as precursors for advanced carbon materials. These PAH oligomers served as a useful analyte system for study, as their solvent solubilities decrease significantly with each increasing oligomeric unit. Molecular weight standards consisting of relatively pure dimer and trimer cuts of the starting M-50 petroleumpitch were produced using a dense-gas/supercritical extraction (DGE/SCE) technique and were then used to produce oligomeric mixtures of well-defined composition for study. Both traditional, solvent-based and newer, solvent-free sample preparation methods were evaluated, and their effects on both homogeneity and signal response were determined. While solvent-free sample preparation methods produced homogeneous samples and reproducible results regardless of the MWD of the analyte, solvent-based samples that contained more than one oligomeric cut produced non-homogeneous samples and poor reproducibilities. The differing solubilities of dimer, trimer, and tetramer oligomers in a given solvent (e. g., CS2 or toluene) were found to be the cause of the inhomogeneities observed in solvent-based sample preparation. A quantitative analysis study performed with dimer/trimer mixtures over a wide range of compositions via solvent-free sample preparation indicates that linear, reproducible calibration curves can be generated and used to calculate the molecular composition of unknown dimer/trimer mixtures with confidence.

J	Zhang, Jack Z.; Colon-Mercado, Hector R.; Goodwin, James G., Jr.								The effect of low concentrations of tetrachloroethylene on H-2 adsorption and activation on Pt in a fuel cell catalyst								JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES				196	20			8391	8397		10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.06.081			OCT 15 2011	2011	The poisoning effect of tetrachloroethylene (TTCE) on the activity of a Pt fuel cell catalyst for the adsorption and activation of H-2 was investigated at 60 degrees C and 2 atm using hydrogen surface concentration measurements. The impurity was chosen as a model compound for chlorinated cleaning and degreasing agents that may be introduced into a fuel cell as a contaminant at a fueling station and/or during vehicle maintenance. In the presence of only H-2, introduction of up to 540 ppm TTCE in H-2 to Pt/C resulted in a reduction of available Pt surface atoms (measured by H-2 uptake) by ca. 30%, which was not enough to shift the H-2-D-2 exchange reaction away from being equilibrium limited. Exposure of TTCE to Pt/C in a mixed redox environment (hydrogen + oxygen), similar to that at the cathode of a fuel cell, resulted in a much more significant loss of Pt surface atom availability, suggesting a role in TTCE decomposition and/or Cl poisoning. Regeneration of catalyst activity of poisoned Pt/C showed the highest level of recovery when regenerated in only H-2, with much less recovery in H-2 + O-2 or O-2. The results from this study are in good agreement with those found in a fuel cell study by Martinez-Rodriguez et al. [2] and confirm that the majority of the poisoning from TTCE on fuel cell performance is most likely at the cathode, rather than the anode. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In our work, we harness this strategy to build high-capacity silicon (Si) nanopowder-based lithium (Li)-ion batteries with improved performance characteristics. Si offers more than one order of magnitude higher capacity than graphite, but it exhibits dramatic volume changes during electrochemical alloying and de-alloying with Li, which typically leads to rapid anode degradation. We show that mixing Si nanopowder with alginate, a natural polysaccharide extracted from brown algae, yields a stable battery anode possessing reversible capacity eight times higher than that of the state-of-the-art graphitic anodes.									517	28	0	33	1	528			0036-8075			WOS:000295580300042	21903777

Our cell viability, proliferation, and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production assays clearly indicated that C-60(OH)(20) suppressed cell damage as well as ROS production induced by copper, probably through neutralization of the metal ions by C-60(OH)(20) in the extracellular space, as well as by adsorption and uptake of the nanoparticles surface-modified by the biomolecular species in the cell medium. This double-exposure study provides new data on the effects of nanoparticles on cell metabolism and may aid the treatment of oxidant-mediated diseases using nanomedicine.									5	0	0	3	0	5			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000294945800001	21896981

Simulated electron diffraction patterns and atomic-resolution annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) images of the computed nanotube structures show promise that this peculiar feature can be identified experimentally. The small intrinsic twist removes the translational periodicity prescribed by the rolled-up construction and defines a nanotube for which the atomic order is most fundamentally described by the objective structures concept.									4	0	0	2	0	4			1098-0121			WOS:000295634700004

The cis and trans isomers of the alkynyl complexes were separated using solubility differences, and the stereochemistry was characterized using infrared spectroscopy of the CH2 rocking and NH bending region. All of the trans[M(cyclam)(CCR)(2)]OTf complexes exhibit strong Raman bands between 2071 and 2109 cm I, ascribed to vs(C equivalent to C). The stretching frequencies for the Cr(III) complexes are 21-28 cm(-1) lower than for the analogous Rh(III) complexes, a result that can be interpreted in terms of the alkynyl ligands acting as it-donors. UV-vis spectra of the Cr(III) and Rh(III) complexes are dominated by strong charge transfer (CT) transitions. In the case of the Rh(III) complexes, these CT transitions obscure the metal centered (MC) transitions, but in the case of the Cr(III) complexes the MC transitions are unobscured and appear between 320 and 500 nm, with extinction coefficients (170-700 L mol(-1) cm(-1)) indicative of intensity stealing from the proximal CT bands. The, Cr(III) complexes show long-lived (240-327 mu s), structureless, MC emission centered between 731 and 748 nm in degassed room temperature aqueous solution. Emission characteristics are also consistent with the arylallcynyl ligands acting as pi-donors. The Rh(III) complexes also display long-lived (4-21 mu s), structureless, metal centered emission centered between 524 and 548 nm in degassed room temperature solution (CH3CN).									14	0	0	0	0	14			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000295115000022	21888339

Posets from Admissible Coxeter Sequences								ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF COMBINATORICS				18	1					P197				OCT 3 2011	2011	We study the equivalence relation on the set of acyclic orientations of an undirected graph generated by source-to-sink conversions. These conversions arise in the contexts of admissible sequences in Coxeter theory, quiver representations, and asynchronous graph dynamical systems. To each equivalence class we associate a poset, characterize combinatorial properties of these posets, and in turn, the admissible sequences. This allows us to construct an explicit bijection from the equivalence classes over Gamma to those over Gamma' and Gamma '', the graphs obtained from Gamma by edge deletion and edge contraction of a fixed cycle-edge, respectively. This bijection yields quick and elegant proofs of two non-trivial results: (i) A complete combinatorial invariant of the equivalence classes, and (ii) a solution to the conjugacy problem of Coxeter elements for simply-laced Coxeter groups. The latter was recently proven by H. Eriksson and K. Eriksson using a much different approach.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1077-8926			WOS:000295532700004

Oerst.								CHILEAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH				71	4			542	548					OCT-DEC 2011	2011	Abscisic acid (ABA) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) participate in the propagation of plants by somatic embryogenesis, causing polar structural differentiation of the embryo. The goal of the assay was to compare endogenous levels of ABA and IAA between somatic embryos (SE) and zygotic embryos (ZE) of Nothofagus alpina (Poepp. & Endl.) Oerst. In this study, a somatic embryo maturation assay involving the addition of varying concentrations of exogenous ABA was performed on cotyledonary-stage of N. alpina. Furthermore, the endogenous levels of ABA and IAA were quantified in the immature ZE, the mature ZE, and the embryonic axis of a mature embryo of N. alpina. The current study utilized high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for quantification. The maturation treatments performed did not present significant differences in the endogenous ABA levels in SE. However, significant differences did exist in levels of ABA and IAA between SE submitted to the different maturation treatments and mature ZE of N. alpina. The application of exogenous ABA to the culture medium increased endogenous ABA levels, therefore, increasing the number of germinated somatic embryos. Thus, the plant conversion process was also successfully completed in somatic embryos of N. alpina.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0718-5820			WOS:000298100700007

The ability to operate a mobile robot was indexed by task completion time and total number of course collisions. Results showed that participants with higher spatial abilities exhibited superior performance in both direct line of sight and teleoperation. Performance under direct line of sight was correlated with both spatial relations and spatial visualization, whereas performance during teleoperation was only correlated with spatial relations ability. Understanding the roles of spatial abilities under different viewing conditions will aid in the advancement of selection criteria and training paradigms for robot operators.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1054-7460			WOS:000300527200006

However, genomic resources for this tree species are limited. We constructed cDNA libraries from ten different types of tissues: premeiotic flower buds, postmeiotic flower buds, open flowers, developing fruit, terminal buds, leaves, cambium, xylem, roots, and seedlings. EST sequences were generated either by 454 GS FLX or Sanger methods. Assembly of almost 2.4 million sequencing reads from all libraries resulted in 137,923 unigenes (132,905 contigs and 4,599 singletons). About 50% of the unigenes had significant matches to publically available plant protein sequences, representing a wide variety of putative functions. Approximately 30,000 simple sequence repeats were identified. More than 97% of the cell wall formation genes in the Cell Wall Navigator and the MAIZEWALL databases are represented. The cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) homologs identified in the L. tulipifera EST dataset showed different expression levels in the ten tissue types included in this study. In particular, the LtuCAD1 was found to partially recover the stiffness of the floral stems in the Arabidopsis thaliana CAD4 and CAD5 double mutant plants, of the LtuCAD1 in lignin biosynthesis.

Osteopontin is a chemotactic cytokine produced by macrophages, and is implicated in extracellular matrix remodeling. Furthermore, osteopontin is up-regulated in granulomatous disease, and osteopontin null mice exhibit reduced granuloma formation. Animal models currently used to investigate chronic lung granulomatous inflammation bear a pathological resemblance, but lack the chronic nature of human granulomatous disease. Carbon nanoparticles are generated as byproducts of combustion. Interestingly, experimental exposures to carbon nanoparticles induce pulmonary granuloma-like lesions. However, the recruited cellular populations and extracellular matrix gene expression profiles within these lesions have not been explored. Because of the rapid resolution of granulomas in current animal models, the mechanisms responsible for persistence have been elusive. To overcome the limitations of previous models, we investigated whether a model using multiwall carbon nanoparticles would resemble chronic human lung granulomatous inflammation. We hypothesized that pulmonary exposure to multiwall carbon nanoparticles would induce granulomas, elicit a macrophage and T-cell response, and mimic other granulomatous disorders with an up-regulation of osteopontin. This model demonstrates: (1) granulomatous inflammation, with macrophage and T-cell infiltration; (2) resemblance to the chronicity of human granulomas, with persistence up to 90 days; and (3) a marked elevation of osteopontin, metalloproteinases, and cell adhesion molecules in granulomatous foci isolated by laser-capture microdissection and in alveolar macrophages from bronchoalveolar lavage. The establishment of such a model provides an important platform for mechanistic studies on the persistence of granuloma.									21	0	0	11	0	21			1044-1549			WOS:000299681000024	21398620

In this approach a scale model of the casting mold was built using fused deposition modeling rapid prototyping technique, then used to validate design, material and process parameters. After selection and testing on the scaled prototype, results were used to define a full-sized spin casting mold built using polyphenylsulfone material. This material was selected based on the process temperature and stress requirements. However, surface roughness in the as-built condition is unacceptable for demolding; this paper describes secondary processing to mitigate this effect. The result is a feasible process for manufacturing of centrifugal casting molds for polyurethane. [DOI: 10.1115/1.4004848]									1	0	0	0	0	1			1087-1357			WOS:000299125100003

The objective of this study is to investigate the cell membrane stability under the external normal pressure. This investigation is performed by studying the dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine bilayer behavior under different normal pressures using molecular dynamics. As the normal pressure increases, the force necessary to rupture the bilayer structure decreases, which indicates cell membrane instability under high normal pressure. This phenomenon can also be explained by the change of free energy difference before and after rupture under different normal pressures. The effect of the pulling speed on the rupture force is also investigated, showing that the rupture force increases almost linearly with the pulling speed.

To help address this issue, this paper presents two instructional approaches to introduce students to social sustainability by using a conceptual model derived from four dimensions of social sustainability: community involvement, corporate social responsibility, safety through design, and social design. In the first instructional approach, the instructor is the primary facilitator; in the second approach, the students become the experts, sharing their knowledge with their peers. Methods to assess student understanding of these dimensions, such as concept mapping, are proposed. By providing the conceptual model and methods to teach it, this paper is for the purpose of assisting those teaching the social dimensions of sustainability to CE students, who will gain an understanding of how their technical decisions affect social sustainability.

Reactive molten core fabrication of silicon optical fiber								OPTICAL MATERIALS EXPRESS				1	6			1141	1149					OCT 1 2011	2011	Silicon optical fibers fabricated using the molten core method possess high concentrations of oxygen in the core [Opt. Express 16, 18675 (2008)] due to dissolution of the cladding glass by the core melt. The presence of oxygen in the core can influence scattering, hence propagation losses, as well as limit the performance of the fiber. Accordingly, it is necessary to achieve oxygen-free silicon optical fibers prior to further optimization. In this work, silicon carbide (SiC) is added to the silicon (Si) core to provide an in situ reactive getter of oxygen during the draw process. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and powder x-ray diffraction (P-XRD) are used to verify that the glass-clad silicon optical fibers possess very low oxygen concentrations and that the SiC is consumed fully during the reactive molten core fabrication. Optical measurements indicated a reduction in light scattering out of the silicon core as expected. However, the measured attenuation of about 10 dB/cm, which is consistent with existing low-oxygen-content silicon fibers, implies that scattering might not be the dominant source of loss in these molten core-derived silicon fibers. More generally, this work shows that the high temperature processing of optical fibers can be an asset to drive chemical reactions rather than be limited by them.

J	Hutchison, Amy; Reinking, David								Teachers' Perceptions of Integrating Information and Communication Technologies Into Literacy Instruction: A National Survey in the United States								READING RESEARCH QUARTERLY				46	4			312	333		10.1002/RRQ.002			OCT-DEC 2011	2011	This research explores literacy teachers perceptions of integrating information communication technologies (ICTs) into literacy instruction. To this end, a national survey of 1,441 literacy teachers in the United States was conducted. The survey provided data concerning the types and levels of reported availability and use of ICTs, beliefs about the importance of integrating ICTs into literacy instruction, and perceived obstacles to doing so. The analysis of data included descriptive statistics, an exploratory factor analysis, and a path analysis used to test a model hypothesizing a relation between teachers perceived importance of technology and reported levels of integration. Results revealed relatively low levels of curricular integration, consistent perceptions about obstacles to integration, and technological rather than curricular definitions of ICTs and of integration. The path analysis suggested several characteristics and influences associated with higher levels of integration and use. The findings advance understanding of the extent to which ICTs are being integrated into literacy instruction and what factors should be considered toward profitably increasing integration consistent with expanding definitions of literacy.									24	0	0	0	0	24			0034-0553			WOS:000298479700002

Predictors of Individual Knowledge Acquisition Commitment in a Post-Soviet Setting								MANAGEMENT INTERNATIONAL REVIEW				51	5			697	728		10.1007/s11575-011-0092-1			OCT 2011	2011	Drawing upon interdisciplinary literature, particularly institutional theory, we tested Nonaka's (1994) predictors of individual knowledge acquisition commitment among 1,949 employees from four firms in Ukraine, a transition economy where low absorption of knowledge has slowed economic reforms.Five personality traits explained nearly 44% of the variance in knowledge acquisition commitment, but the results concerning the influence of individuals' perceptions of the organizational context were mixed.The findings affirm the value of individual level research in international management (IM), and underscore the importance of contextualizing theoretical models of knowledge acquisition rather than assuming universality.The results have practical implications for the performance of international joint ventures and subsidiaries that are dependent on host country labor in this context, and for indigenous firms attempting to transfer knowledge from developed economies.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0938-8249			WOS:000297365800005

We have investigated the potential for using the crude glycerol as a carbon substrate. In batch mode, the biomass and lipid concentration of Chlorella protothecoides cultivated in a crude glycerol medium were, respectively, 23.5 and 14.6 g/l in a 6-day cultivation. In the fed-batch mode, the biomass and lipid concentration improved to 45.2 and 24.6 g/l after 8.2 days of cultivation, respectively. The maximum lipid productivity of 3 g/l day in the fed-batch mode was higher than that produced by batch cultivation. This work demonstrates the feasibility of crude biodiesel glycerol as an alternative carbon substrate to glucose for microalgal cultivation and a cost reduction of carbon substrate feed in microalgal lipid production may be expected.									56	1	0	41	0	57			0141-5492			WOS:000297162900009	21691839

In this flow a centre jet and an annular flow, consisting of acetone-doped air and ethylene respectively, are mixed with the co-flow air. A unique aspect of this study compared to previous studies of three-scalar mixing is that two of the scalars (the centre jet and air) are separated by the third (annular flow); therefore, this flow better approximates the mixing process in a non-premixed turbulent reactive flow. Planar laser-induced fluorescence and Rayleigh scattering are employed to measure the mass fractions of the acetone-doped air and ethylene. The results show that the most unique aspects of the three-scalar mixing occur in the near field of the flow. The mixing process in this part of the flow are analysed in detail using the scalar means, variances, correlation coefficient, joint probability density function (JPDF), conditional diffusion, conditional dissipation rates and conditional cross-dissipation rate. The diffusion velocity streamlines in scalar space representing the conditional diffusion generally converge quickly to a manifold along which they continue at a lower rate. A widely used mixing model, interaction through exchange with mean, does not exhibit such a trend. The approach to the manifold is generally in the direction of the ethylene mass fraction. The difference in the magnitudes of the diffusion velocity components for the two scalars cannot be accounted for by the difference in their dissipation time scales. The mixing processes during the approach to the manifold, therefore, cannot be modelled by using different dissipation time scales alone. While the three scalars in this flow have similar distances in scalar space, mixing between two of the scalars can occur only through the third, forcing a detour of the manifold (mixing path) in scalar space. This mixing path presents a challenging test for mixing models since most mixing models use only scalar-space variables and do not take into account the spatial (physical-space) scalar structure. The scalar JPDF and the conditional dissipation rates obtained in the present study have similarities to those of mixture fraction and temperature in turbulent flames. The results in the present study provide a basis for understanding and modelling multiscalar mixing in reactive flows.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0022-1120			WOS:000296905700019

Au thin films with the thickness of 5 nm were deposited by ion sputtering. Temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) was carried out to investigate the optical properties of the ZnO nanorods. Five peaks at 3.363, 3.327, 3.296, 3.228, and 3.143 eV, corresponding to the free exciton (FX), neutral donor bound exciton (D X), first order longitudinal optical phonon replica of free exciton (FX-1LO), FX-2LO, and FX-3LO emissions, were obtained at low-temperature (10 K). The intensity of these peaks decreased and their position was red shifted with the increase in the temperature. The FX emission peak energy of the ZnO nanorods exhibited an anomalous behavior (red-blue-red shift) with the increase in temperature. This is also known as an "S-shaped" emission shift. The thermal activation energy for the exciton with increasing temperature in the ZnO nanorods is found to be about 26.6 meV; the values of Varshni's empirical equation fitting parameters are = 5 x 10(-4) eV/K, beta = 350 K, and E-g(0) = 3.364 eV.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1738-8228			WOS:000297191000011

The allelopathic effects of DHAP were evaluated under laboratory conditions on P. schrenkiana, rice (Oryza sativa L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), radish (Raphanus sativus L.), lettuce (Latuca sativa L.), cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) and mung bean (Phaseolus radiatus L.). DHAP significantly inhibited seed germination and seedling growth of P. schrenkiana at concentrations of 2.5 mM and 0.5 mM (p < 0.05). Soil analysis revealed that P. schrenkiana forest soils contained exceptionally high DHAP concentrations (mean = 0.51 +/- 0.03 mg/g dry soil), sufficient to inhibit natural P. schrenkiana recruitment. DHAP also exhibited strong allelopathic potential. It significantly inhibited wheat and lettuce seed germination at concentrations of 1 mM and 0.5 mM (p < 0.05). The active compound also completely inhibited root growth of the six test species at high concentrations. Our results suggest a dual role of DHAP, both as an allelochemical and as an autotoxicant. The potential for a single plant needle-leached compound to influence both inter- and intra-specific interactions emphasized the complex effects that plant secondary metabolites might have on plant population and community structure.									12	5	0	9	0	16			1420-3049			WOS:000296973000050	22024957	
J	Pittman, H. T.; Bowerman, W. W.; Grim, L. H.; Grubb, T. G.; Bridges, W. C.								Using nestling feathers to assess spatial and temporal concentrations of mercury in bald eagles at Voyageurs National Park, Minnesota, USA								ECOTOXICOLOGY				20	7	SI		1626	1635		10.1007/s10646-011-0736-8			OCT 2011	2011	Bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) have been utilized as a biosentinel of aquatic ecosystem health in the Great Lakes Region since the early 1960s. Bald eagle populations have been monitored at Voyageurs National Park (VNP), Minnesota, since 1973. For the past 20 years, researchers have collected feathers from nestling bald eagles to assess their dietary exposure to mercury (Hg) on Rainy, Kabetogama, and Namakan lakes in VNP. Mercury is an environmental pollutant with both natural and anthropogenic sources, and negatively affects many species of wildlife. In a previous study, geometric mean concentrations of Hg in feathers of nestling bald eagles were greater at VNP (20 mg/kg Dry Weight (DW)) than in nestling feathers from other Great Lakes subpopulations (similar to 7 mg/kg DW), for the period 1985-1989. Current geometric mean concentrations have declined by 77.4% since 1989 at VNP. While all samples from 1985 to 1989 had detectable concentrations of Hg, 10% of current samples had concentrations below the reportable detection limit (0.001 mg/kg DW, n = 180). The major lakes at VNP are impounded, and Hg concentrations also declined greatly after the lake level stabilization order by the International Joint Commission was implemented in 1999. Mercury concentrations in feathers of nestling bald eagles from 1989 to 2010 ranged from ND (<0.001) to 34.97 mg/kg DW. The highest single concentration in a nestling was from Namakan Lake in 2010. The five-year geometric means for Rainy, Kabetogama, and Namakan lakes for 2006-2010 were 6.08, 1.07, and 5.56 mg/kg DW (n = 28, n = 32, n = 27) respectively. Although Hg concentrations in feathers of nestlings greatly declined after the change in water level management in 1999 and are lower than 1989 concentrations, recent samples suggest a gradual increase. Continued monitoring of nestling feather concentrations will be essential to assess this increase, to determine the source of Hg, to determine if there are changes to methylation potential, and to evaluate and optimize water level management.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0963-9292			WOS:000296736200013	21779822

Free radicals were initiated either chemically using 2,2'-azodiisobutyramidine dihydrochloride (AAPH) or by radiation with a blue light source emitting 390-470 nm (peak 420 nm). Two reagents, dihydrorhodamine 123 (Dhr123) and singlet oxygen sensor green (SOSG), were used as radical probes. Quantum dots and carbon dots inhibited oxidation of the radical probes under decomposition of AAPH. However, when subjected to the blue light both the quantum dots and carbon dots induced oxidation of Dhr123 to a greater extent than SOSG in water. Generation of singlet oxygen was remarkably enhanced in deuterium oxide solutions while oxidation of Dhr123 remained unchanged. For comparison, traditional photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX mainly induced oxidation of SOSG in water. In conclusion, upon external radiation carbon dots or quantum dots generate reactive oxygen species acting as prooxidants. Carbon dots or quantum dots also scavenge free radicals that are generated chemically by an azo compound. Such dual properties of these nanoparticles can be used for photodynamic and photocatalytic or antioxidant applications.									27	1	0	7	0	27			1550-7033			WOS:000296996200007	22195484

As a byproduct of petroleum refining processes, effluent containing Se may be produced due to geochemistry of the formations from which petroleum is derived. Pilot-scale constructed wetland treatment systems (CWTSs) were designed and built at Clemson University to evaluate removal of Se from simulated refinery effluent (SRE). For this study, objectives were to: (1) chemically and physically characterize a specific petroleum refinery effluent for simulation and assess Se as a constituent of concern, (2) design and conduct bench-scale experiments to measure Se removal in response to organic carbon additions, (3) design and build a pilot-scale CWTS using information from the bench-scale experiments, and (4) measure the performance of the pilot-scale CWTS in terms of rate and extent of Se removal in response to organic carbon additions following a period of maturation and acclimation. The treatment goal (i.e., Se removal) for this study was to decrease the Se concentration in SRE from similar to 50 mu g/L to less than 5 mu g/L. Samples were collected from the pilot-scale CWTS inflow and the outflow from each wetland cell. In order to determine rates and extents of Se removal and factors that may influence performance, parameters measured from the sampling locations included elemental analysis of Se, dissolved oxygen concentration, conductivity, pH, alkalinity, hardness, and temperature. Outflow Se concentrations ranged from 3.4 to 9.8 mu g/L, depending on the experimental treatment, with an organic carbon addition to the simulated effluent inflow. This pilot-scale study illustrates that CWTSs can enhance Se removal from a simulated petroleum refinery effluent and that performance (i.e., removal of constituents of concern) can be achieved to meet stringent discharge limits.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0049-6979			WOS:000296696000025

We have acquired Herschel/PACS photometric fluxes at 70 mu m and 160 mu m, as well as a detection of the [OI] 63 mu m fine-structure line in emission, and derived upper limits for some other far-IR OI, CII, CO and o-H2O lines. These observations were carried out in the frame of the open time key programme GASPS, where ETCha was selected as one of the science demonstration phase targets. The Herschel data is complemented by new simultaneous ANDICAM B-K photometry, new HST/COS and HST/STIS UV-observations, a non-detection of CO J = 3 -> 2 with APEX, re-analysis of a UCLES high-resolution optical spectrum showing forbidden emission lines like [OI] 6300 angstrom, [SII] 6731 angstrom and 6716 angstrom, and [NII] 6583 angstrom, and a compilation of existing broad-band photometric data. We used the thermo-chemical disk code ProDiMo and the Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code MCFOST to model the protoplanetary disk around ETCha. The paper also introduces a number of physical improvements to the ProDiMo disk modelling code concerning the treatment of PAH ionisation balance and heating, the heating by exothermic chemical reactions, and several non-thermal pumping mechanisms for selected gas emission lines. By applying an evolutionary strategy to minimise the deviations between model predictions and observations, we find a variety of united gas and dust models that simultaneously fit all observed line and continuum fluxes about equally well. Based on these models we can determine the disk dust mass with confidence, M-dust approximate to (2-5) x 10(-8) M-circle dot whereas the total disk gas mass is found to be only little constrained, M-gas approximate to (5 x 10(-5)-3 x 10(-3)) M-circle dot. Both mass estimates are substantially lower than previously reported. In the models, the disk extends from 0.022 AU (just outside of the co-rotation radius) to only about 10 AU, remarkably small for single stars, whereas larger disks are found to be inconsistent with the CO J = 3 -> 2 non-detection. The low velocity component of the [OI] 6300 angstrom emission line is centred on the stellar systematic velocity, and is consistent with being emitted from the inner disk. The model is also consistent with the line flux of H-2 v = 1 -> 0 S(1) at 2.122 mu m and with the [OI] 63 mu m line as seen with Herschel/PACS. An additional high-velocity component of the [OI] 6300 angstrom emission line, however, points to the existence of an additional jet/outflow of low velocity 40-65 km s(-1) with mass loss rate approximate to 10(-9) M-circle dot/yr. In relation to our low estimations of the disk mass, such a mass loss rate suggests a disk lifetime of only similar to 0.05-3 Myr, substantially shorter than the cluster age. If a generic gas/dust ratio of 100 was assumed, the disk lifetime would be even shorter, only similar to 3000 yrs. The evolutionary state of this unusual protoplanetary disk is discussed.									32	0	0	1	0	33			0004-6361			WOS:000296554800021

In this study, we developed a novel non-parameter Ising model to integrate protein-protein interaction network and microarray data for identifying differentially expressed (DE) genes. We also proposed a simulated annealing algorithm to find the optimal configuration of the Ising model. The Ising model was applied to two breast cancer microarray data sets. The results showed that more cancer-related DE sub-networks and genes were identified by the Ising model than those by the Markov random field model. Furthermore, cross-validation experiments showed that DE genes identified by Ising model can improve classification performance compared with DE genes identified by Markov random field model.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1615-9853			WOS:000296142100011	21761563

Bivariate logistic regressions revealed that higher levels of optimism, spiritual well-being, and family social support predicted reasons for living. Multivariate logistic regressions indicated that spiritual well-being showed unique predictive value for reasons for living. Further, the multivariate model accurately predicted reasons for living 72% of the time. Partial support was found for a cumulative protective model hypothesizing a linear relationship between the number of protective factors endorsed and increased reasons for living. Implications for community-based preventive and recovery-oriented intervention efforts and future research are discussed.									7	0	0	1	1	8			0363-0234			WOS:000295938900003	21793874

Graphene Oxide: A Nonspecific Enhancer of Cellular Growth								ACS NANO				5	10			8100	8107		10.1021/nn202699t			OCT 2011	2011	There have been multiple conflicting reports about the biocompatibility and antimicrobial activity of graphene oxide. To address this, we conducted a study to characterize the antimicrobial properties of graphene oxide (GO) and its biocompatibility with mammalian cells. When GO was added to a bacterial culture at 25 mu g/mL, the results showed that bacteria grew faster and to a higher optical density than cultures without GO. Scanning electron microscopy indicated that bacteria formed dense biofilms in the presence of GO. This was shown by a large mass of aggregated cells and extracellular polymeric material. Bacterial growth on filters coated with 25 and 75 mu g of GO grew 2 and 3 times better than on filters without GO. Closer analysis showed that bacteria were able to attach and proliferate preferentially in areas containing the highest GO levels. Graphene oxide films failed to produce growth inhibition zones around them, indicating a lack of antibacterial properties. Also, bacteria were able to grow on GO films to 9.5 x 10(9) cells from an initial inoculation of 1.0 x 10(6), indicating that it also lacks bacteriostatic activity. Thus, silver-coated GO films were able to produce clearing zones and cell death. Also, graphene oxide was shown to greatly enhance the attachment and proliferation of mammalian cells. This study conclusively demonstrates that graphene oxide does not have Intrinsic antibacterial, bacteriostatic, and cytotoxic properties in both bacteria and mammalian cells. Furthermore, graphene oxide acts as a general enhancer of cellular growth by increasing cell attachment and proliferation.									189	9	0	65	0	197			1936-0851			WOS:000296208700062	21932790	
J	Moss, Jason D.; Austin, Jon; Salley, James; Coats, Julie; Williams, Krysten; Muth, Eric R.								The effects of display delay on simulator sickness								DISPLAYS				32	4	SI		159	168		10.1016/j.displa.2011.05.010			OCT 2011	2011	The experience of simulator sickness (SS) during head-mounted display (HMD) exposure continues to be a problem. The aim of these two experiments was to examine the effect of delay on SS while viewing a real, live video scene via an HMD. An object search task was performed in both experiments. Experiment 1 examined 0 and 200 ms of delay and Experiment 2 examined 0,145, and 300 ms of delay. SS did not differ as a function of delay. However, SS increased as duration exposure increased in both experiments. In Experiment 1, SS was greater during the first experimental session than the second. SS did not differ between those who donned an HMD and a No HMD control condition in Experiment 2. It is possible that this is due to adaptation to repeated exposure to the sickening stimulus. This adaptation could have confounded the delay effects from Experiment 1. For this reason, a second experiment with an increased intersession interval was conducted. Intersession intervals for Experiment 2 were increased to 11-14 days from 7 days in Experiment 1. However, no effect of delay or session was found in Experiment 2. These results suggested that SS does not increase as a function of delay, but exposure duration increases SS. Also, performing repetitive head movements alone may have elicited symptoms of SS. As reported by other researchers, it appears that adaptation can occur to motion sickness stimuli with intersession intervals of up to 7 days, but not with 11-14 days. Other characteristics of HMD VEs need to be examined because SS occurs and delay does not appear to be as strong of a causal factor as once thought. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Tungsten anodes of 500 pm down to 4 pm diameter were used to observe the gradual decrease in operating voltage for the proportional region with a decreasing anode diameter. The 40 nm diameter CNTs anodes ranged in length from 35 to 105 mu m. The absolute detection efficiency was measured at similar to 10(-6)%. An electrostatic computer model was used to predict the resulting electric field associated with a single CNT in the coaxial configuration. For a single anode coaxial design the model predicted that the electric field was insufficient for secondary ionizations which contributed to a low amplitude signal and that the small volume of the ionization region resulted in the low absolute detection efficiency. To overcome the problems of low absolute detection efficiency and operational issues with the single anode, CNT arrays were investigated. Electrostatic modeling of 100 nm x 40 mu m long CNTs in an array with a 50 mu m pitch conducted for a parallel plate configuration indicated that each anode functioned independently.

The effect of high-pressure densification on ballistic-penetration resistance of a soda-lime glass								PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART L-JOURNAL OF MATERIALS-DESIGN AND APPLICATIONS				225	L4			298	315		10.1177/1464420711412849			OCT 2011	2011	Molecular-level modelling and simulations of the high-pressure volumetric response and irreversible densification of a prototypical soda-lime glass are first employed. The molecular-simulation results obtained were next used to modify the pressure versus degree-of-compression (the negative of volumetric strain) and yield strength versus pressure relations in order to account for the effects of irreversible densification. These relations are next used to upgrade the equation of state and the strength constitutive laws of an existing material model for glass. This was followed by a set of transient non-linear dynamics calculations of the transverse impact of a glass test plate with a solid right-circular cylindrical steel projectile. The results obtained show that irreversible densification can provide only a minor improvement in the ballistic resistance of glass and only in the case of high-velocity (ca. 1000 m/s) projectiles. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that if the key irreversible compaction parameters can be adjusted by modifications in glass chemistry and microstructure, significant improvements in the glass ballistic resistance can be attained over a relatively wide range of projectile velocities.									11	0	0	0	0	11			1464-4207	2041-3076		WOS:000295889500008

One largely ignored issue is lapse or cancellation of policies. Individuals who let a LTCI policy lapse face resumed risk of LTC expenditures while suffering the financial loss of premiums paid. The motivation for lapse has been poorly understood, though some have hypothesized that improvements in health risk may be responsible. We use 1996-2006 Health and Retirement Study data from 3974 respondents who report having private LTCI to estimate baseline and dynamic predictors of lapse and test for ex post adverse selection. Individuals who lapse are generally poorer, less educated, less healthy, and more likely to be racial and ethnic minorities than those who retain their policies. Changes in health status play a relatively small role in lapse, and we find little evidence for adverse selection associated with lapse. We conclude that lapse of LTCI is more an issue of finances and alternatives than a reassessment of health risk. Because lapse rates are highest among the least healthy individuals, lapse should be considered explicitly in efforts to expand the LTCI market.

These methods include monitoring the strain at the inner surface of the restraining steel ring, using passive acoustic emission, and measuring the electrical resistance of conductive materials that are applied to the surface of the mortar. The methods for detecting cracking are compared and their advantages and limitations are discussed. Both plain and steel fiber reinforced (2% steel fiber by volume) mortar were evaluated in this study. The time of through cracking detected by the three methods corresponds to the time of visible cracking. In the mixtures containing fibers the time of through cracking is delayed significantly when compared to the plain systems. The delay in the age of through cracking can be explained by the role of fibers in arresting the cracks as they develop and their role in transferring stress across the crack width that keeps the cracks from opening. The passive acoustic emission data indicates substantial damage development before a through crack forms. The time of through cracking can be detected using conductive surfaces with a sudden increase in resistance of these conductive elements. Cracking can be detected using conductive coatings when the crack is 0.02 mm or larger. Specimens with different degrees of restraint show through cracking at approximately the same stress level; however, the age at which cracking occurs decreases as the degree of restraint increases. This can be attributed to the increased micro-cracking (i.e., damage and precritical crack growth) as confirmed with acoustic emission data.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1346-8014	1347-3913		WOS:000296211500004

LIFE HISTORY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ELK RIVER CRAYFISH								JOURNAL OF CRUSTACEAN BIOLOGY				31	4			647	652		10.1651/10-3436.1			OCT 2011	2011	Cambarus elkensis (Elk River crayfish) was seined and dip-netted monthly during June through August and October through November 2003, and March through May 2004 from Left Fork Holly River in the Elk River drainage, West Virginia, U.S.A. Crayfish reproductive form was classified, and then individuals measured and returned to the stream. Carapace-length (CL) frequency analysis identified five overlapping year classes with growth progressing over a 5-year life span. Ovigerous females were collected in summer (June) and an individual with attached young in October, but young-of-the-year (Y-O-Y) crayfish did not appear in the collections until late winter (March). Juveniles and Y-O-Y dominated the collections and grew rapidly, reaching sexual maturity (>= 29 mm CL) in 30-36 months. Growth continued but slowed in the older mature crayfish with the largest individuals (> 50 mm CL) disappearing from the collections sometime between fall and spring in the fifth year of life. Fastest growing individuals could have reproduced three times during their life. The overall sex ratio of 1265 crayfish favored females 0.87:1. Females identified as form I individuals based on annulus ventralis architecture and presence of glair gland and ova had significantly wider pleons, longer chelae, and heavier bodies than similar CL form II female crayfish lacking these features. Form I males also weighed significantly more and had longer chelae than form II males of similar CL. This is the first evidence of the existence of reproductive form alternation in females in the genus Cambarus.									6	0	0	7	0	7			0278-0372			WOS:000296111700011

The peptide exhibited an ACE-inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 20 mu M. Also, the peptide could efficiently quench the (1,1)-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl free radicals and exhibit high anticoagulation activity with a complete inhibition at 100 mM. Moreover, the peptide has a good stability against protease digestion. These results suggest that the peptide RVPSL may have potential to be used in nutraceuticals and functional food.

They were characterized by standard methods of X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, Raman light scattering, and photoluminescence. Properties of GaP nanoparticles were compared with industrial and specially grown perfect GaP single crystals. It was shown that the GaP nanoparticles in suspension are the most suitable for high quality GaP/polymers nanocomposites because only they are uniform with dimensions of about 10 nm which is optimal for appearance of the pronounced quantum confinement effect. Polyglycidyl methacrylate (PGMA), polyglycidyl methacrylate-co-polyoligoethyleneglycol methacrylate (PGMA-co-POEGMA), and biphenyl vinyl ether (BPVE) polymers were used to prepare GaP polymer nanocomposites. The thickness of the polymer nanocomposite film was about 250-300 nm defined from AFM scratch experiment. The resulting nanocomposites yielded a bright luminescence at room temperature in a broad band with the maximum ranging from 2.5 to 3.2 eV and showed pronounced quantum confinement effects and other interesting and important for application phenomena leading to dramatic 1 eV expansion of GaP luminescence to the UV spectral region.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1388-0764			WOS:000295609700111

Functional Interactions between Polydnavirus and Host Cellular Innexins								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				85	19			10222	10229		10.1128/JVI.00691-11			OCT 2011	2011	Polydnaviruses are double-stranded DNA viruses associated with some subfamilies of ichneumonoid parasitoid wasps. Polydnavirus virions are delivered during wasp parasitization of a host, and virus gene expression in the host induces alterations of host physiology. Infection of susceptible host caterpillars by the polydnavirus Campoletis sonorensis ichnovirus (CsIV) leads to expression of virus genes, resulting in immune and developmental disruptions. CsIV carries four homologues of insect gap junction genes (innexins) termed vinnexins, which are expressed in multiple tissues of infected caterpillars. Previously, we demonstrated that two of these, VinnexinD and VinnexinG, form functional gap junctions in paired Xenopus oocytes. Here we show that VinnexinQ1 and VinnexinQ2, likewise, form junctions in this heterologous system. Moreover, we demonstrate that the vinnexins interact differentially with the Innexin2 orthologue of an ichnovirus host, Spodoptera frugiperda. Cell pairs coexpressing a vinnexin and Innexin2 or pairs in which one cell expresses a vinnexin and the neighboring cell Innexin2 assemble functional junctions with properties that differ from those of junctions composed of Innexin2 alone. These data suggest that altered gap junctional intercellular communication may underlie certain cellular pathologies associated with ichnovirus infection of caterpillar hosts.									8	0	0	8	0	8			0022-538X			WOS:000296253900054	21813607

Seabird use of discards from a nearshore shrimp fishery in the South Atlantic Bight, USA								MARINE BIOLOGY				158	10			2289	2298		10.1007/s00227-011-1733-4			OCT 2011	2011	Shrimp trawling is common throughout the southeastern and Gulf of Mexico coasts of the USA and is the primary contributor to fisheries discards in these regions. Tens of thousands of nearshore seabirds nest near shrimp trawling grounds in the USA, but to date, there has been no assessment of the relationship between seabirds and shrimp trawlers. We examined the taxonomic composition of bycatch, rate at which seabirds scavenged bycatch, and energy density of discarded bycatch in a nearshore commercial shrimp fishery. Bycatch was primarily comprised of demersal fish that are not typically accessible to the plunge-diving and surface-feeding seabirds that occur in the area. Hence, seabird diets in the region appear to be broadened taxonomically by the availability of discards. Results from discard experiments indicated that 70% of the nearly 5,500 items discarded by hand were scavenged by seabirds and that the fate of a discarded item was most strongly predicted by its taxonomic order. Laughing gulls scavenged the greatest proportion of discards, although brown pelicans were the only species to scavenge more discards than predicted based upon their abundance. Because this is the first such study in the region, it is difficult to ascertain the extent or intensity of the impact that discards have on nearshore seabirds. Nonetheless, our results suggest that it will be difficult for managers to clearly understand fluctuations in local seabird population dynamics without first understanding the extent to which these species rely upon discards. This may be especially problematic in situations where seabird populations are recovering following natural or anthropogenic stressors.									3	0	0	2	0	3			0025-3162			WOS:000296089900013

Water temperature, water depth, light irradiance, light transmittance, pH, and conductivity were also recorded during biomass harvests. Overall, few significant relationships were observed between the environmental factors tested and seasonal biomass. Submersed shoot biomass was negatively related (p < 0.01) with water temperature. Stolons accounted for 40-95% of total biomass followed by emergent shoot, submersed shoot, and root biomass. Percent starch in plant tissues was positively related to water temperature. Starch allocation was greatest in stolons where up to 16.3% of total starch was stored. Submersed shoots stored 0.6-11.0% of total starch followed by emergent shoots (0.4-7%). The roots of M. aquaticum stored less than 3.8% of total starch throughout the study period. Reduced biomass and starch storage occurred from October to March in both 2006 and 2007. Management strategies for this species could utilize an integrated approach to exploit times of low energy reserves (fall and winter), or to remove emergent shoots to gain access to the stolons and other submersed tissues.

Responses of Lyngbya magnifica Gardner to an algaecide exposure in the laboratory and field								ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY				74	7			1832	1838		10.1016/j.ecoenv.2011.06.007			OCT 2011	2011	Predicting responses of organisms exposed to toxic materials in the field from results produced in laboratory studies and confirming those predictions has been a central question in aquatic toxicology since its inception. A field treatment of a cyanobacterium and laboratory measurements of responses to algaecide exposures provided an opportunity to address that question. This research involved predicting the response of Lyngbya magnifica to an algaecide exposure (Phycomycin (R) SCP) in the laboratory and evaluating that prediction with a comparable exposure in the field. Based on the results from initial laboratory experiments, an effective algaecide and concentration (i.e. 92 mg Phycomycin (R) SCP/g algae) were selected for field application in a farm pond. L magnifica chlorophyll a and biomass were measured initially and 1, 4, 7, 10, and 21 days after treatment (DAT) for both laboratory and field exposures. Measurements of chlorophyll a decreases in the field treatment at 7, 10, and 21 days after treatment were significantly greater than responses obtained in similar laboratory exposures of Phycomycin (R) SCP. Biomass was significantly decreased in the field at 21 DAT compared to laboratory measurements. This approach can be effective for site specific predictions and can provide valuable information for informed decisions regarding water resource management and should be included in a management plan for increased product efficiency and ecological safety.

Crystals were grown at 600-650 degrees C at 2 kbar in water with high concentrations (10-20 M) of KOH as a mineralizer. Under these conditions crystals formed spontaneously and could also be transported to suitable seeds to form large (3-8 mm/edge) single crystals. Experiments were done to optimize transport conditions and the quality of the crystals for the first time. The crystals were doped with trivalent laser active ions such as Er3+ and Yb3+. Absorption spectra of the doped materials were determined. Thermal conductivities of the pure single crystals as well as of the Yb-doped crystals were determined between room temperature and 77 K. The conductivity of the pure crystals increases significantly at lower temperatures as expected, and is significantly greater than that of YAG. The Yb-doped crystals have a thermal conductivity almost unchanged from the pure host, which is promising for use in high-energy laser applications.									22	1	0	0	0	23			1528-7483			WOS:000295488200023

Iron binding of 3-hydroxychromone, 5-hydroxychromone, and sulfonated morin: Implications for the antioxidant activity of flavonols with competing metal binding sites								JOURNAL OF INORGANIC BIOCHEMISTRY				105	10			1314	1322		10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2011.07.006			OCT 2011	2011	The iron binding properties and antioxidant activities of compounds with hydroxy-keto binding sites, 3-hydroxychromone, 5-hydroxychromone, and sulfonated morin were investigated. For these compounds, prevention of iron-mediated DNA damage and kinetics of Fe(II) oxidation were studied in aqueous solutions close to physiological pH (pH 6). 3-Hydroxychromone and sulfonated morin inhibit iron-mediated DNA damage at lower concentrations than 5-hydroxychromone. All three compounds bind iron, but 3-hydroxychromone and sulfonated morin promote Fe(II) oxidation much faster than 5-hydroxychromone. These results indicate that DNA damage inhibition by flavonols with competing hydroxy-keto binding sites is primarily due to iron binding at the 3-hydroxy-keto site. Iron oxidation rate also plays a significant role in antioxidant activity. In addition to iron binding and oxidation, reactive oxygen species scavenging occurs at high concentrations for the hydroxychromones. This study emphasizes the importance of iron binding in polyphenol antioxidant behavior and provides insights into the iron binding antioxidant activity of similar flavonols such as quercetin and myricetin.

J	Dailey, Oliver D., Jr.; Wang, Xi; Chen, Feng; Huang, Guohui								Anticancer Activity of Branched-chain Derivatives of Oleic Acid								ANTICANCER RESEARCH				31	10			3165	3169					OCT 2011	2011	Background: A number of unsaturated fatty acids and a few saturated branched-chain fatty acids have been reported to exhibit anticancer activity. Materials and Methods: In previously reported research, several novel branched-chain derivatives (methyl, n-butyl, phenyl) of methyl oleate were produced by bromination in the allylic position and subsequent treatment with organocuprate reagents. These compounds and their free acid counterparts were tested in vitro for their antiproliferative activities against two cancer cell lines: MCF-7 (human breast) and HT-29 (human colon). In addition, two sets of isomeric tertiary alcohols obtained as side-products in the synthesis of the branched-chain derivatives were evaluated. Testing was performed at three concentration levels (50, 100, and 200 ppm) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Results: The greatest growth inhibitory activity was exhibited by the branched phenyl derivative of oleic acid, with IC(50) at 48 ppm against both MCF-7 and HT-29. The branched n-butyl derivative of oleic acid also exhibited significant antiproliferative activity, with IC(50) at 82 ppm against MCF-7 and 77 ppm against HT-29. Conclusion: The observed potent anticancer activity of the n-butyl and phenyl derivatives indicates that certain synthetic branched-chain unsaturated fatty acids have potential in the treatment of cancer and further research is warranted.									6	0	0	5	0	6			0250-7005			WOS:000295667700008	21965723	
J	Kim, Jinkyung; Miller, Cortney M.; Shepherd, Marion W., Jr.; Liu, Xiaohua; Jiang, Xiuping								Impact of indigenous microorganisms on Escherichia coli O157:H7 growth in cured compost								BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY				102	20			9619	9625		10.1016/j.biortech.2011.07.055			OCT 2011	2011	Both autoclaving and dry-heat treatments were applied to dairy manure-based compost to achieve target populations of indigenous microorganisms. A 3 strain-mixture of Escherichia coli O157:H7 of ca. 2 log CFU/g was inoculated into acclimated autoclaved compost (AAC) and dry heat-treated compost (DHTC) with different moistures, and stored at 8, 22, or 30 degrees C. Only selected groups of microorganisms grew in AAC during acclimation, whereas the relative ratio of each group of microorganisms was maintained in DHTC after heat treatment. E. colt O157:H7 grew more in MC than DHTC in the presence of same level of indigenous mesophiles. However, control compost (no heat treatment) did not support E. coli O157:H7 growth. Our results revealed that both the type and population of indigenous microorganisms is critical for suppressing E. coli O157:H7 growth in compost, and dry-heat treatment can result in a compost product which resembles cured compost with different levels of indigenous microorganisms.

Effect of exogenous somatotropin in Holstein calves on mammary gland composition and proliferation								JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE				94	10			5005	5016		10.3168/jds.2011-4229			OCT 2011	2011	Pubertal mammary gland growth and development are hormonally regulated, but the details are poorly understood in calves. Our purpose was to evaluate the effects of exogenous growth hormone (CH) on the biochemical composition of the prepubertal mammary gland, mRNA expression of selected genes, and histological characteristics of the developing parenchyma (PAR). In this experiment, 19 calves (7 +/- 4 d of age) were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatments: bovine somatotropin (bST, 500 mg; n = 10) or placebo (Sal; 0.9% saline; n = 9). Animals were treated every 3 wk beginning on d 23. Calves were assigned to an early (65 d; tissue harvested. after 2 treatment injections) or late collection time (107 d; tissue harvested after 4 treatment injections). Calves were fed milk replacer and calf starter for 8 wk and starter and hay thereafter. Parenchyma and mammary fat pad (MFP) from one udder half were harvested for analysis of protein, lipid, and DNA. Additional tissues were preserved for histological analysis or snap-frozen for quantitative real-time PCR. Somatotropin treatment did not significantly alter the mass of PAR or MFP or the general pattern of development of epithelial structures. Significant increases were observed in protein/100 kg of body weight (BW), total protein, DNA concentration, DNA/100 kg of BW, and total DNA in 107-d calves, and a significant treatment by day interaction was observed for DNA and lipid concentrations in PAR. In MFP, a significant decrease was observed in protein/100 kg of BW in bST-treated calves and in total MET protein in 65-d calves. A treatment by day interaction was found for total protein, DNA, and protein/100 kg of BW. In PAR, relative expression of ATPase-binding cassette 3 and growth hormone receptor were reduced by bST and both were lower in 107-d-harvest calves. Epithelial cell retention of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU; possible indicator of stern-like cells) was greatest in 65-d bST-treated calves, and a significant time of sampling response and treatment x time interaction were observed. Expression of the proliferation marker protein Ki67 was numerically higher in bST-treated calves but the difference was nonsignificant. Retention of the BrdU label was reduced in 107-d calves. Exogenous growth hormone given to calves may affect mammary tissue composition and epithelial cell gene expression in subtle ways but exogenous supplementation with bST alone is not likely to alter overall development patterns or affect the mass of mammary parenchymal tissue. Whether such subtle changes have an effect on subsequent development or function is unknown.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-0302			WOS:000295192600025	21943751	
J	Arai, Yuji								Aqueous interfacial chemistry of kaolinite for the removal of Cu(II) in the presence of birnessite: Kinetic and spectroscopic studies								APPLIED CLAY SCIENCE				53	4			572	580		10.1016/j.clay.2011.05.006			OCT 2011	2011	In this study, the aqueous interfacial chemistry of kaolinite was investigated during the removal of Cu(II) in birnessite suspensions. Adsorption kinetic experiments and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) were coupled to better understand the complexity of Cu(II) reactivity and uptake mechanisms in the mixed mineral system. Throughout all experiments (ionic strength = 0.01 M NaNO(3), [Cu](total) = 100 mu M), the two minerals' surface areas (6 and 8.6 m(2)/500 mL) were maintained by altering the mass ratio of kaolinite (0-0.34 g) and birnessite (0-0.48 g). Copper sorption generally increased with increasing pH from 4 to 6 in all samples. The "birnessite only" system showed the fastest kinetics while the Cu uptake in the "kaolinite only" system was slowest under the respective reaction conditions. The first order kinetic model indicated that the apparent rate constants (ka') of kaolinite are 7.92E-6 s(-1) at pH 4 and 6.14E-6 s(-1) at pH 6. However, the addition of birnessite to kaolinite enhanced the Cu uptake when the respective systems (i.e., same surface area) were compared. For both surface areas, ka' nearly doubled at pH 4 and was seventeen times greater at pH 6. XAS analyses show that the sorption of Jahn-Teller distorted Cu(II) octahedral molecules retain not only on birnessite surface but also on kaolinite surfaces. In the "kaolinite only" system, Cu(II) readily forms outer-sphere Cu dimer surface species (R(cu-cu): 2.89-2.96 +/- 0.02 A. CN(cu-cu) 0.7 +/- 0.2) at pH similar to 6 while the "birnessite only" system contains corner-sharing inner-sphere surface species (R(cu-mn): -3.45 angstrom, CN(cu-cu) 2.9 +/- 0.2) in layered MnO(6) structures at pH -4. Interestingly, these two surface species co-existed when the two minerals were mixed. Regardless of changes in total surface area and pH, the fraction of tridentate species in bimessite was always greater than the fraction of dimers in kaolinite. However, the fraction of tridentate corner-sharing surface species decreased with increasing pH from 4 to 6, while the dimers in kaolinite became important surface species at higher pH. The results reported in this study provide new information about the ability of kaolinite to retain metals in a mixed mineral environment. Metal surface speciation on phyllosilicate surfaces in heterogeneous media might be as important as in metal (oxyhydr)oxides in predicting metal transport processes in soils and sediments.

J	Sharma, Suraj; Luzinov, Igor								Ultrasonic curing of one-part epoxy system								JOURNAL OF COMPOSITE MATERIALS				45	21			2217	2224		10.1177/0021998311401075			OCT 2011	2011	Ultrasonic curing of one-part epoxy system was studied using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. During both isothermal oven curing and ultrasonic curing of this system, an induction period was observed. For the rapid progression of polymerization reaction in ultrasonic curing, a preheating temperature of 100 degrees C was found to be sufficient. However, degree of curing due to the nonthermal effect of ultrasonic curing was found to be maximal at a preheating temperature of 80 degrees C. It was noticed that the ultrasonic curing reduced the time of curing by a factor of four, and the curing level from pure thermal effects could be determined by incorporating the curing temperature history into the autocatalytic chemical model. The degree of curing from the experimental results of isothermal heating in DSC and the one predicted by the autocatalytic chemical model exhibited a good agreement.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0021-9983			WOS:000295264700008		
J	Gosnell, W. Casey; Butcher, Michael T.; Maie, Takashi; Blob, Richard W.								Femoral loading mechanics in the Virginia opossum, Didelphis virginiana: torsion and mediolateral bending in mammalian locomotion								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY				214	20			3455	3466		10.1242/jeb.060178			OCT 2011	2011	Studies of limb bone loading in terrestrial mammals have typically found anteroposterior bending to be the primary loading regime, with torsion contributing minimally. However, previous studies have focused on large, cursorial eutherian species in which the limbs are held essentially upright. Recent in vivo strain data from the Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana), a marsupial that uses a crouched rather than an upright limb posture, have indicated that its femur experiences appreciable torsion during locomotion as well as strong mediolateral bending. The elevated femoral torsion and strong mediolateral bending observed in D. virginiana might result from external forces such as a medial inclination of the ground reaction force (GRF), internal forces deriving from a crouched limb posture, or a combination of these factors. To evaluate the mechanism underlying the loading regime of opossum femora, we filmed D. virginiana running over a force platform, allowing us to measure the magnitude of the GRF and its three-dimensional orientation relative to the limb, facilitating estimates of limb bone stresses. This three-dimensional analysis also allows evaluations of muscular forces, particularly those of hip adductor muscles, in the appropriate anatomical plane to a greater degree than previous two-dimensional analyses. At peak GRF and stress magnitudes, the GRF is oriented nearly vertically, inducing a strong abductor moment at the hip that is countered by adductor muscles on the medial aspect of the femur that place this surface in compression and induce mediolateral bending, corroborating and explaining loading patterns that were identified in strain analyses. The crouched orientation of the femur during stance in opossums also contributes to levels of femoral torsion as high as those seen in many reptilian taxa. Femoral safety factors were as high as those of non-avian reptiles and greater than those of upright, cursorial mammals, primarily because the load magnitudes experienced by opossums are lower than those of most mammals. Thus, the evolutionary transition from crouched to upright posture in mammalian ancestors may have been accompanied by an increase in limb bone load magnitudes.									9	0	0	9	0	9			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000295322600018	21957109

Advances in Recombinant Gonadotropin Production for Use in Bovine Superovulation								REPRODUCTION IN DOMESTIC ANIMALS				46	5			933	942		10.1111/j.1439-0531.2011.01767.x			OCT 2011	2011	Bovine ovarian hyperstimulation is a process that currently relies on pituitary-derived follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) to facilitate the maturation of multiple follicles to achieve dominance and eventual ovulation. The prevalence of this process, also called superovulation, has more than doubled in the past 10 years, but the efficiency of recovered transferable embryos has remained low at similar to 6 per collection. The use of pituitary-derived products presents other problems including contamination from other hormones, inconsistencies within and among batches, and the possibility of the spread of disease-transmitting agents. Recombinant gonadotropins have been engineered to yield varieties of FSH and luteinizing hormone from a myriad of heterologous hosts with the resulting products demonstrating various levels of biological activity. Research has also been devoted to alternative delivery methods to reduce the frequency of injections required in current superovulatory protocols. Together, recombinant gonadotropins and alternative delivery approaches potentially provide an economical alternative to the use of pituitary-derived products.									3	0	0	2	0	3			0936-6768			WOS:000295087300029	21366721

Brief Report: Chimeric Pigs Produced from Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Demonstrate Germline Transmission and No Evidence of Tumor Formation in Young Pigs								STEM CELLS				29	10			1640	1643		10.1002/stem.713			OCT 2011	2011	The recent development of porcine induced pluripotent stem cells (piPSCs) capable of generating chimeric animals, a feat not previously accomplished with embryonic stem cells or iPSCs in a species outside of rodents, has opened the doors for in-depth study of iPSC tumorigenicity, autologous transplantation, and other key aspects to safely move iPSC therapies to the clinic. The study of iPSC tumorigenicity is critical as previous research in the mouse showed that iPSC-derived chimeras possessed large numbers of tumors, rising significant concerns about the safety of iPSC therapies. Additionally, piPSCs capable of generating germline chimeras could revolutionize the transgenic animal field by enabling complex genetic manipulations (e. g., knockout or knockin of genes) to produce biomedically important large animal models or improve livestock production. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time in a nonrodent species germline transmission of iPSCs with the live birth of a transgenic piglet that possessed genome integration of the human POU5F1 and NANOG genes. In addition, gross and histological examination of necropsied porcine chimeras at 2, 7, and 9 months showed that these animals lacked tumor formation and demonstrated normal development. Tissue samples positive for human POU5F1 DNA showed no C-MYC gene expression, further implicating C-MYC as a cause of tumorigenicity. The development of germline-competent porcine iPSCs that do not produce tumors in young chimeric animals presents an attractive and powerful translational model to study the efficacy and safety of stem cell therapies and perhaps to efficiently produce complex transgenic animals.

There is currently much interest in restoring high quality longleaf pine habitats to such areas, but managers may also desire the retention of some existing canopy trees to meet current conservation objectives. However, fast-growing natural loblolly pine regeneration may threaten the success of artificially regenerated longleaf pine seedlings. We evaluated the establishment and growth of natural loblolly pine regeneration following different levels of timber harvest using single-tree selection (Control (uncut, residual basal area similar to 16 m(2)/ha), MedBA (residual basal area of similar to 9 m(2)/ha). LowBA (residual basal area of similar to 6 m(2)/ha), and Clearcut (complete canopy removal)) and to different positions within canopy gaps (approximately 2800 m(2)) created by patch cutting at two ecologically distinct sites within the longleaf pine range: Fort Benning, GA in the Middle Coastal Plain and Camp Lejeune, NC in the Lower Coastal Plain. The density of loblolly pine seedlings was much higher at Camp Lejeune than at Fort Benning at the end of the first growing season after harvesting. Following two growing seasons, there were no significant effects of canopy density or gap position on the density of loblolly pine seedlings at either site, but loblolly pine seedlings were taller on treatments with greater canopy removal. Prescribed fires applied following the second growing season killed 70.6% of loblolly pine seedlings at Fort Benning and 64.3% of seedlings at Camp Lejeune. Loblolly pine seedlings were generally less than 2 m tall, and completeness of the prescribed burns appeared more important for determining seedling survival than seedling size. Silvicultural treatments that include canopy removal, such as patch cutting or clearcuts, will increase loblolly pine seedling growth and shorten the window of opportunity for control with prescribed fire. Therefore, application of prescribed fire every 2-3 years will be critical for control of loblolly pine regeneration during restoration of longleaf pine in existing loblolly pine stands.

Effect of Mechanical Loading on Electrical Conductivity in Porcine TMJ Discs								JOURNAL OF DENTAL RESEARCH				90	10			1216	1220		10.1177/0022034511415275			OCT 2011	2011	The objective of this study was to examine the impact of mechanical loading on solute transport in porcine temporomandibular joint (TMJ) discs using the electrical conductivity method. The electrical conductivity, as well as ion diffusivity, of TMJ discs was determined under confined compression with 3 strains in 5 disc regions. The average electrical conductivity over the 5 regions (mean +/- SD) at 0% strain was 3.10 +/- 0.68 mS/cm, decreased to 2.76 +/- 0.58 mS/cm (-11.0%) at 10% strain, and 2.38 +/- 0.55 mS/cm (-22.2%) at 20% compressive strain. Correspondingly, the average relative ion diffusivity (mean +/- SD) at 0% strain was 0.273 +/- 0.055, decreased to 0.253 +/- 0.048 (-7.3%) at 10% strain, and 0.231 +/- 0.048 (-15.4%) at 20% compressive strain. These results indicated that compressive strain impeded solute transport in the TMJ disc. Furthermore, our results showed that the transport properties of TMJ discs were region-dependent. The electrical conductivity and ion diffusivity in the anterior region were significantly higher than in the posterior region. This regional difference is likely due to the significant differences of tissue hydration between these 2 regions. This study provides important insight into the electrical and solute transport behaviors in TMJ discs under mechanical loading and aids in the understanding of TMJ pathophysiology related to tissue nutrition.									9	0	0	5	0	9			0022-0345			WOS:000294838200012	21743033

Computational Investigation of Hardness Evolution During Friction-Stir Welding of AA5083 and AA2139 Aluminum Alloys								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				20	7			1097	1108		10.1007/s11665-010-9741-y			OCT 2011	2011	A fully coupled thermo-mechanical finite-element analysis of the friction-stir welding (FSW) process developed in our previous work is combined with the basic physical metallurgy of two wrought aluminum alloys to predict/assess their FSW behaviors. The two alloys selected are AA5083 (a solid-solution strengthened and strain-hardened/stabilized Al-Mg-Mn alloy) and AA2139 (a precipitation hardened quaternary Al-Cu-Mg-Ag alloy). Both of these alloys are currently being used in military-vehicle hull structural and armor systems. In the case of non-age-hardenable AA5083, the dominant microstructure-evolution processes taking place during FSW are extensive plastic deformation and dynamic re-crystallization of highly deformed material subjected to elevated temperatures approaching the melting temperature. In the case of AA2139, in addition to plastic deformation and dynamic recrystallization, precipitates coarsening, over-aging, dissolution, and re-precipitation had to be also considered. Limited data available in the open literature pertaining to the kinetics of the aforementioned microstructure-evolution processes are used to predict variation in the material hardness throughout the various FSW zones of the two alloys. The computed results are found to be in reasonably good agreement with their experimental counterparts.									33	2	0	0	1	33			1059-9495			WOS:000294964100001

Multi-Length Scale Modeling of High-Pressure-Induced Phase Transformations in Soda-Lime Glass								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				20	7			1144	1156		10.1007/s11665-010-9774-2			OCT 2011	2011	Molecular-level modeling and simulations are employed to study room-temperature micro-structural and mechanical response of soda-lime glass when subjected to high (i.e., several giga-Pascal) uniaxial-strain stresses/pressure. The results obtained revealed the occurrence of an irreversible phase-transformation at ca. 4 GPa which was associated with a (permanent) 3-7% volume reduction. Close examination of molecular-level topology revealed that the pressure-induced phase transformation in question is associated with an increase in the average coordination number of the silicon atoms, and the creation of two- to fourfold (smaller, high packing-density) Si-O rings. The associated loading and unloading axial-stress versus specific-volume isotherms were next converted into the corresponding loading Hugoniot and unloading isentrope axial-stress versus specific-volume relations. These were subsequently used to analyze the role of the pressure-induced phase-transformation/irreversible-densification in mitigating the effects of blast and ballistic impact loading onto a prototypical glass plate used in monolithic and laminated transparent armor applications. The results of this part of the study revealed that pressure-induced phase-transformation can provide several beneficial effects such as lowering of the loading/unloading stress-rates and stresses, shock/release-wave dispersion, and energy absorption associated with the study of phase-transformation.									15	0	0	0	0	15			1059-9495	1544-1024		WOS:000294964100007

Effects of in ovo injection of carbohydrates on embryonic metabolism, hatchability, and subsequent somatic characteristics of broiler hatchlings								POULTRY SCIENCE				90	10			2134	2143		10.3382/ps.2011-01418			OCT 1 2011	2011	The effects of the in ovo injection of different carbohydrate solutions on the internal egg temperature (IT), hatchability, and time of hatch of embryonated Ross x Ross 708 broiler hatching eggs were determined. In addition, the BW, liver weight, yolk sac weight (YSW), and yolk-free BW (YFBW) of the embryos on d 19.5 of incubation and of the chicks on day of hatch were determined. Eggs containing live embryos were injected in the amnion on d 18.5 of incubation using an automated multiple-egg injector. Solution injections delivered 1.2 mL of physiological saline (0.85%) alone or with a supplemental carbohydrate. The following supplemental carbohydrates were separately dissolved in saline at a concentration of 0.3 g/mL: glucose, fructose, sucrose, maltose, and dextrin. Temperature transponders were implanted in the air cells of embryonated and nonembryonated eggs after in ovo injection for the detection of IT at 6, 14, and 22 h after injection. The IT of embryonated eggs was significantly greater than that of nonembryonated eggs at all 3 times after the treatment period. Eggs that were injected with saline with or without supplemental carbohydrates experienced a reduction in IT when compared with control eggs whose shells were perforated without solution delivery, and the decrease in IT was associated with a delay in hatch time. Liver weight was negatively related to YSW and positively related to YFBW, and YSW was negatively related to YFBW. Although the saline and carbohydrate solution injections increased chick BW compared with noninjected controls, chick YFBW was decreased in the maltose-and sucrose-injected groups. In conclusion, the injection of 1.2 mL of saline with or without supplemental carbohydrates lowered embryonic metabolism, as reflected by a lower IT and a delay in time of hatch. However, effects of the different carbohydrate solutions on yolk absorption and tissue deposition in yolk-free embryos varied. These results suggest that lower volumes for solutions containing maltose, sucrose, or fructose should be considered for in ovo injection.									11	0	0	11	1	12			0032-5791			WOS:000295033200002	21933993

Blood heterophil: lymphocyte ratio and corticosterone levels were measured as indicators of the level of stress. Corticosterone levels of stressed broilers (24,358.67 pg/mL) were 10-fold higher (P = 0.002) than those of nonstressed broilers (2,275.46 pg/mL). However, no difference (P = 0.29) was found in heterophil: lymphocyte ratio of nonstressed (0.29) and stressed (0.31) birds. Carnosine content in breast of stressed birds (17.39 mg/g) was 10 times higher (P = 0.005) than that of nonstressed birds (1.85 mg/g). Carnosine content in thigh of stressed birds (21.25 mg/g) was approximately 2-fold higher (P = 0.001) than that of nonstressed birds (11.10 mg/g). Carnosine content in brain of stressed birds did not differ (P = 0.82) from that of nonstressed birds. Based on the present study, muscle carnosine recovery levels increase during short-term stress, whereas levels in the brain are not affected.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0032-5791			WOS:000295033200028	21934019

Occupational therapy in health care				25	4			213	24		10.3109/07380577.2011.607227			2011-Oct	2011	ABSTRACT Physicians have the potential to serve as an important portal for information gathering, assessment, counseling, and reporting older driver fitness, as almost all older adults require medical care and have a primary care physician. However, there are few studies that have evaluated physician knowledge about, attitudes toward, and performance of older driver fitness assessment. Two pilot studies were conducted to assess physician knowledge and attitudes and aid understanding of physician knowledge of legal reporting requirements regarding older driver medical fitness. Results suggest that although physicians believe that patients should be evaluated for safe driving, many physicians do not routinely assess fitness to drive and few feel qualified to do so. It also appears that physicians may not be adequately knowledgeable about laws about reporting unsafe drivers. Thus, occupational therapy practitioners have an opportunity to educate about driving as a complex instrumental activity of daily living.									5	0	0	2	0	5				1541-3098		MEDLINE:23899076	23899076

To date, research has focused primarily on fine-grained maps (linkage designs) covering small areas. In contrast, we devised 7 steps to coarsely map dozens to hundreds of linkages over a large area, such as a nation, province, or ecoregion. We provide recommendations on how to perform each step on the basis of our experiences with 6 projects: California Missing Linkages (2001), Arizona Wildlife Linkage Assessment (2006), California Essential Habitat Connectivity (2010), Two Countries, One Forest (northeastern United States and southeastern Canada) (2010), Washington State Connected Landscapes (2010), and the Bhutan Biological Corridor Complex (2010). The 2 most difficult steps are mapping natural landscape blocks (areas whose conservation value derives from the species and ecological processes within them) and determining which pairs of blocks can feasibly be connected in a way that promotes conservation. Decision rules for mapping natural landscape blocks and determining which pairs of blocks to connect must reflect not only technical criteria, but also the values and priorities of stakeholders. We recommend blocks be mapped on the basis of a combination of naturalness, protection status, linear barriers, and habitat quality for selected species. We describe manual and automated procedures to identify currently functioning or restorable linkages. Once pairs of blocks have been identified, linkage polygons can be mapped by least-cost modeling, other approaches from graph theory, or individual-based movement models. The approaches we outline make assumptions explicit, have outputs that can be improved as underlying data are improved, and help implementers focus strictly on ecological connectivity.									57	0	0	51	0	58			0888-8892			WOS:000294908000006	21797924	
J	Brosnan, Denis A.; Sanders, John P.; Hart, Stephanie A.								Application of thermal analysis in preservation and restoration of historic masonry materials Part A. Characterization of materials								JOURNAL OF THERMAL ANALYSIS AND CALORIMETRY				106	1			109	115		10.1007/s10973-011-1422-z			OCT 2011	2011	Thermal analysis techniques have been used in characterizing building materials from significant historic properties in the Charleston, South Carolina area. Determining the chemical and physical effects of deterioration resulting from long periods of exposure is a first step in formulating preservation strategies. In this regard, simultaneous thermal analysis coupled with evolved gas analysis has been used to study reactions between air, seawater, and masonry materials. Further, the traditional petrographic identification of mortar composition is greatly facilitated through use of thermal analysis. Simultaneous thermal analysis allows for an exact determination of the calcium carbonate content in mortars as an alternative to the use of an inferred value based on chemical analysis data. The partial dissolution of calcium carbonate in the presence of sea salt is a major deterioration process. Further, natural cements manufactured in the United States are identified, in part, based on their thermogravimetric (TG) traces and their evolved gases. The data indicates that natural cements form some carbonate phases in addition to the major hydrate phases. Clay bricks are found to exhibit interaction with sea water, with uptake of bicarbonate suggested. Additionally, there is evidence of re-hydroxylation in the 160 year old bricks. The bricks made in coastal zones contain a considerable free silica fraction that is composed of a small percentage of cristobalite. The silica content of the clay bricks is seen to result in very high thermal expansion coefficients in the area of 10 x 10(-6) to 12 x 10(-6) K(-1). These studies provide guidance in restoration efforts where authenticity of cements is important. In the event that replacement bricks are required, matching the thermal expansion coefficient of the original bricks is a requirement for preservation of the masonry structure.					38th Annual Meeting of the North-American-Thermal-Analysis-Society38th Annual Meeting of the North-American-Thermal-Analysis-Society	AUG 15-18, 2010AUG 15-18, 2010	N Amer Thermal Anal SocN Amer Thermal Anal Soc	Philadelphia, PAPhiladelphia, PA	5	0	0	0	0	5			1388-6150			WOS:000294910100014

These proteins consist of a large central domain composed of approximately 100 tandem copies of a 35-40 amino acid repeat sequence. Non-repetitive N and C-terminal domains, of which the C-terminal domain has been implicated to transition from soluble and insoluble states during spinning, flank the repetitive core. The N-terminal domain until recently has been largely unknown due to difficulties in cloning and expression. Here, we report nearly complete assignment for all (1)H, (13)C, and (15)N resonances in the 14 kDa N-terminal domain of major ampullate spidroin 1 (MaSp1-N) of the golden orb-web spider Nephila clavipes.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1874-2718			WOS:000294559700002	21152998	
J	Rivera, Angela R. V.; Wyneken, Jeanette; Blob, Richard W.								Forelimb kinematics and motor patterns of swimming loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta): are motor patterns conserved in the evolution of new locomotor strategies?								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY				214	19			3314	3323		10.1242/jeb.057364			OCT 2011	2011	Novel functions in animals may evolve through changes in morphology, muscle activity or a combination of both. The idea that new functions or behavior can arise solely through changes in structure, without concurrent changes in the patterns of muscle activity that control movement of those structures, has been formalized as the neuromotor conservation hypothesis. In vertebrate locomotor systems, evidence for neuromotor conservation is found across evolutionary transitions in the behavior of terrestrial species, and in evolutionary transitions from terrestrial species to flying species. However, evolutionary transitions in the locomotion of aquatic species have received little comparable study to determine whether changes in morphology and muscle function were coordinated through the evolution of new locomotor behavior. To evaluate the potential for neuromotor conservation in an ancient aquatic system, we quantified forelimb kinematics and muscle activity during swimming in the loggerhead sea turtle, Caretta caretta. Loggerhead forelimbs are hypertrophied into wing-like flippers that produce thrust via dorsoventral forelimb flapping. We compared kinematic and motor patterns from loggerheads with previous data from the red-eared slider, Trachemys scripta, a generalized freshwater species exhibiting unspecialized forelimb morphology and anteroposterior rowing motions during swimming. For some forelimb muscles, comparisons between C. caretta and T. scripta support neuromotor conservation; for example, the coracobrachialis and the latissimus dorsi show similar activation patterns. However, other muscles (deltoideus, pectoralis and triceps) do not show neuromotor conservation; for example, the deltoideus changes dramatically from a limb protractor/elevator in sliders to a joint stabilizer in loggerheads. Thus, during the evolution of flapping in sea turtles, drastic restructuring of the forelimb was accompanied by both conservation and evolutionary novelty in limb motor patterns.									6	0	0	4	0	6			0022-0949			WOS:000294663300026	21900480

With trends of increasing global seed production and trade, seed-health testing is an important quality control step to prevent the introduction of harmful pathogens into agricultural production systems. An effective seed-health assay depends on a test that can provide timely, sensitive and broad-spectrum detection of all genetic variants of a pathogen, or in some cases, of several different pathogens. Previously, we developed a real-time PCR (qPCR) assay that would permit the simultaneous detection of two major seed-borne pathogens of cucurbits, the bacterium Acidovorax avenae subsp. citrulli (AAC, the causal agent of bacterial fruit blotch) and a fungus Didymella bryoniae (DB, the causal agent of gummy stem blight). The objective of the present study was to develop a sensitive, reverse transcriptase (RT)-based, qRT-PCR for broad spectrum detection of both serotypes of Squash mosaic virus (SqMV), that could be incorporated into a simultaneous detection of three pathogen types in a single PCR reaction. Converting SqMV RNA to cDNA prior to multiplexing stabilized the viral template that was then mixed with two other DNA templates (AAC and DB). To facilitate seed health testing, a generic plant nucleic acid extraction method was developed for cucurbit seeds. Using this method, nucleic acids extracted from seeds yielded strong signals for each target pathogen in multiplex qPCR. The ability to use a general nucleic acid extraction technique with subsequent PCR to detect bacterial, fungal and viral plant pathogens lends itself to a universal system for cucurbit seed health testing.									9	2	0	8	2	13			0931-1785			WOS:000294873200001		
J	Simar, Leopold; Wilson, Paul W.								Two-stage DEA: caveat emptor								JOURNAL OF PRODUCTIVITY ANALYSIS				36	2			205	218		10.1007/s11123-011-0230-6			OCT 2011	2011	This paper examines the wide-spread practice where data envelopment analysis (DEA) efficiency estimates are regressed on some environmental variables in a second-stage analysis. In the literature, only two statistical models have been proposed in which second-stage regressions are well-defined and meaningful. In the model considered by Simar and Wilson (J Prod Anal 13:49-78, 2007), truncated regression provides consistent estimation in the second stage, where as in the model proposed by Banker and Natarajan (Oper Res 56: 48-58, 2008a), ordinary least squares (OLS) provides consistent estimation. This paper examines, compares, and contrasts the very different assumptions underlying these two models, and makes clear that second-stage OLS estimation is consistent only under very peculiar and unusual assumptions on the data-generating process that limit its applicability. In addition, we show that in either case, bootstrap methods provide the only feasible means for inference in the second stage. We also comment on ad hoc specifications of second-stage regression equations that ignore the part of the data-generating process that yields data used to obtain the initial DEA estimates.									111	0	0	4	3	113			0895-562X			WOS:000294710400009

The study uses thermodynamic and psychometric analyses, to incorporate the effect of changing RH along with the dry bulb temperature on human comfort. Specifically, the study computes the effect of changing the relative humidity on the amount of heat rejected from the passenger compartment and the effect of relative humidity on occupants comfort zone. A practical system implementation is also discussed in terms of an evaporative cooler design. The results show that changing the RH along with dry bulb temperature inside vehicular cabins can improve the air conditioning efficiency by reducing the heat removed while improving the Human comfort sensations as measured by the Predicted Mean Value PMV and the Predicted Percentage Dissatisfied PPD indices.

J	Zhang, Jack Z.; Hongsirikarn, Kitiya; Goodwin, James G., Jr.								Effect and siting of Nafion (R) in a Pt/C proton exchange membrane fuel cell catalyst								JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES				196	19			7957	7966		10.1016/j.jpowsour.2011.05.052			OCT 1 2011	2011	This paper explores the effect and siting (location) of Nation on Pt/C as exists in a PEM fuel cell catalyst layer. The addition of 30 wt% Nation on Pt/C (Nfn-Pt/C) resulted in a severe loss of BET surface area by filling/blocking the smaller pore structures in the carbon support. Surprisingly, the presence of this much Nation appeared to have only a minimal effect on the adsorption capability of either hydrogen or CO on Pt. However, the presence of Nation doubled the amount of time required to purge most of the gas-phase and weakly-adsorbed hydrogen molecules away from the catalyst during hydrogen surface concentration measurements. This strongly chemisorbed surface hydrogen was determined by a H(2)/D(2) switch and exchange procedure. Nation had an even more pronounced effect on the reaction of a larger molecule like cyclopropane. Results from the modeling of cyclopropane hydrogenolysis in an idealized pores suggest that partial blockage of only the pore openings by the Nation for the meso-macropores is sufficient to induce diffusion limitations on the reaction. The facts suggest that most of the Pt particles are in the meso-macropores of the C support, whereas Nation is present primarily on the external surface of the C where it blocks significantly the micropores but only partially the meso-macropores.

Using UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy and ultra-centrifugation, we have conducted a detailed study of the it plasmon energy (present at similar to 5-7 eV) in sub-nm SWCNTs as a function of the size of the bundle. We find that the energy of the it plasmon peak E varies with the bundle diameter D(h) as E = (-0.023 eV)(center dot)ln(D(h)/d(o)) + 5.37 eV, where d(o) = 0.5 nm and corresponds to the smallest tube diameter.(1) This is compared with the same data for HiPCo and Carbolex SWCNTs of larger diameter (1-1.4 nm) confirming a clear dependence of E on the bundle size, which is present in addition to the previously reported dependence of E on SWCNT diameter d.

The results showed that the optimal condition for the hydrolysis by pepsin was at pH 2, temperature 37 A degrees C, and in enzyme to substrate ratio (E/S) of 2 when 8.23% collagen (w/v) and 3.82 h of hydrolysis time were applied. Through the single-enzyme hydrolysis, the ACE inhibitory activity could reach an average of 78.06%. In contrast, when a combination of pepsin and trypsin was used for a multiple-proteases hydrolysis, the ACE inhibitory activity could be significantly improved to an average of 88.25%. Furthermore, the IC50 (mu g/mL) value of the enzyme combination by pepsin and trypsin (141.64 A +/- 22.11) was significantly lower than that of the combinations of pepsin and papain (438.59 A +/- 84.37) or pepsin and protease M (336.76 A +/- 87.88; p < 0.05). Our results have shown that collagen can be used for enzyme-mediated production of ACE inhibitory peptides.									11	2	0	6	0	13			1935-5130			WOS:000293791000011
