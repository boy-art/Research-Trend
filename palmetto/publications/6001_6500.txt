Here, we present experimental evidence for a novel pathway of microbial nitrate reduction, the reverse hydroxylamine:ubiquinone reductase module (reverse-HURM) pathway. Instead of a classical ammonia-forming nitrite reductase that performs a 6 electron-transfer process, the pathway is thought to employ two catalytic redox modules operating in sequence: the reverse-HURM reducing nitrite to hydroxylamine followed by a hydroxylamine reductase that converts hydroxylamine to ammonium. Experiments were performed on Nautilia profundicola strain AmH, whose genome sequence led to the reverse-HURM pathway proposal. N. profundicola produced ammonium from nitrate, which was assimilated into biomass. Furthermore, genes encoding the catalysts of the reverse-HURM pathway were preferentially expressed during growth of N. profundicola on nitrate as an electron acceptor relative to cultures grown on polysulfide as an electron acceptor. Finally, nitrate-grown cells of N. profundicola were able to rapidly and stoichiometrically convert high concentrations of hydroxylamine to ammonium in resting cell assays. These experiments are consistent with the reverse-HURM pathway and a free hydroxylamine intermediate, but could not definitively exclude direct nitrite reduction to ammonium by the reverse-HURM with hydroxylamine as an off-pathway product. N. profundicola and related organisms are models for a new pathway of nitrate ammonification that may have global impact due to the wide distribution of these organisms in hypoxic environments and symbiotic or pathogenic associations with animal hosts.									14	0	0	13	0	14			1664-302X			WOS:000331243000002	23847604	
J	Wang, Di; Ni, Hui; Li, Lijun; Chen, Feng; Xiao, Anfeng; Cai, Huinong; Sun, Wenjin								Identification and characterization of Aspergillus aculeatus JMUdb058 for naringinase production								Weishengwu Xuebao				53	7			691	701					JUL 4 2013	2013	[Objective] A new naringinase. producing strain. JMUdb058 was identified and characterized. [Methods] The strain was identified by morphological observation and 28S rDNA homogeneous analysis. Naringinase was identified by monitoring the hydrolysis of naringin to prunin and naringenin using a reversed phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The regulation of naringinase expression was studied by measuring naringinase activity of 11 different carbon sources and 7 nitrogen sources in shaking cultivation. The naringinase. producing capacity was investigated in both solid. state fermentation and submerged fermentation. [Results] The macro. morphology and micro. morphology of JMUdb058 corresponded to the characteristics of Aspergillus section Nigri Gams. and the 28S rDNA sequences showed homogeneity at 100% to Aspergillus aculeatus. Crude enzymes prepared by both submerged fermentation and solid. state fermentation could hydrolyze naringin to prunin and naringenin. In addition. the enzyme could remove naringin from citrus juice effectively. Carbon resources. including hesperidin. naringin. rutin and rhamnose. and organic nitrogen resources. i.e.. tryptone. soybean meal. yeast extract and corn syrup were shown to express the naringinase. The strain had an outstanding ability to yield naringinase in the solid. state fermentation. which showed an alpha-L-rhamnosidase activity of 5903 U/gds by HPLC. and the naringinase of 1939U/gds by HPLC and 72232 U/gds by Davis method. [Conclusion] It is the first time to report a stain of Aspergillus aculeatus can produce naringinase. carbon source containing rhamnose groups are able to induce the enzyme expression. The stain JMUdb058 is a new microorganism source for high yield of naringinase. in particularly by the solid. state fermentation.									0	7	0	1	0	7			0001-6209			BCI:BCI201400110096

Characterisation of Raman gain spectra in Yb:YAG-derived optical fibres								ELECTRONICS LETTERS				49	14			895	896		10.1049/el.2013.1386			JUL 4 2013	2013	For the first time, Raman gain spectra are measured for three all-glass Yb:YAG crystal-derived optical fibres. It is shown that fibres derived from YAG have a reduced Raman gain relative to that of pure silica, partly because of a significant broadening of the silica Raman lines, and also partly because of yttria and alumina possessing a lower gain than that of silica. Such a designer-materials approach for suppression of stimulated Raman scattering can enable future high-energy and high-peak-power fibre laser systems.									7	1	0	0	0	8			0013-5194			WOS:000322200600027

A promising means to mitigate CO poisoning and to improve the oxidation reduction reaction (ORR) activity is through the use of platinum alloy catalysts. This article reviews recent developments in Pt alloy catalyst utilization and addresses activity comparisons and the relationship between activity and structure characteristics. The mechanisms for improved CO-tolerance and ORR activity are also discussed. Finally, theoretical studies on Pt alloy catalysts are discussed briefly.									22	1	0	1	0	22			0161-4940			WOS:000321687800001

FIBER AND YARN PROPERTIES FROM HIGH-SPEED ROLLER GINNING OF UPLAND COTTON								APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE				29	4			461	471					JUL 2013	2013	Selective breeding has improved upland cotton fiber properties. New high-speed roller ginning technology has advanced to the point that processing capacities have approached that of saw ginning. Producers seeking a better price for their upland cotton are interested in fiber property and textile mill performance data comparing cultivars processed by both saw and roller ginning. Three diverse cultivars, one of them stripper-harvested, were processed by saw ginning, conventional roller ginning, and high-speed roller ginning, with different levels of lint cleaning appropriate to each treatment. Samples were submitted for HVI and AFIS fiber property analysis. Ring-spun yarn from each treatment was tested. Results showed that the roller gin (conventional and high speed) produced fiber that was longer more uniform, had less short fiber, and fewer neps than the saw gin stand. Turnout, color grade, and leaf were not different among gin stand type. With respect to yarn properties, the conventional/high-speed roller gin had fewer thick places, but was higher in vegetable and foreign dark matter (contaminants), seed coats, and neps. The composition of neps changed as fiber was processed into yarn. The conventional/high-speed roller gin had fewer raw stock and card mat neps than the saw gin stand, but more neps in finished yarn. Differences jamong cultivar were prevalent throughout the study. In addition to differences in length, strength, and immature fiber content, the cultivar that was stripper harvested had double the trash content at harvest. There were differences in most fiber properties, but not yarn properties, among lint cleaner type. Roller gin lint cleaning was less aggressive than saw-type lint cleaning and had longer fiber, better uniformity, and fewer neps. Saw-type lint cleaning had better color and leaf grades, and less lint trash. There was no appreciable difference between the two types of roller gin lint cleaning used, but one saw-type lint cleaner as opposed to two was less damaging to the fiber Although roller ginned upland cotton is a niche market, textile mills value the higher quality obtained from roller ginning. Newer upland cultivars may make roller ginning a viable option in parts of the Unites States where roller ginning has not been available previously.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0883-8542			WOS:000324154500003

Health promotion practice				14	4			534	42		10.1177/1524839912461355			2013-Jul	2013	In developing recommendations for core measures/items for the evaluation of the Youth Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP), three nutrition education curricula, implemented by land grant universities, were content analyzed. Selection criteria included the following: Curriculum content must include all EFNEP core content areas and must be implemented in more than one state with school children in third through fifth grades. Content analysis strategies were employed to identify and describe common areas/themes and mediators of behaviors addressed across the selected curricula. Content analysis coding was based on a list of behavioral mediators, which have empirical associations with nutrition, physical activity, and food safety. The most evident approaches identified across the three curricula were to enhance motivation, teach cognitive knowledge, and practice behavioral skills. The presence of self-regulation and environmental theory-based strategies was limited in all three curricula. In addition, multiple themes for nutrition, physical activity, and food safety were commonly addressed across curricula with multiple educational strategies. Based on these findings, recommendations for developing content appropriate measures and items for an outcome evaluation tool for Youth EFNEP are provided.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1524-8399			MEDLINE:23159995	23159995

An Advanced Course in Long Term Care for Geriatric Medicine Fellows								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION				14	7			499	506		10.1016/j.jamda.2013.02.012			JUL 2013	2013	Long term care deserves focused attention within a geriatric medicine fellowship curriculum to ensure that graduates are prepared not only for clinical care but also for the leadership, administrative, educational, quality improvement, and health policy aspects of their future roles. This report describes the curriculum development and program evaluation of an advanced course in long term care for geriatric medicine fellows and other graduate/post-graduate health professionals at Duke University. Course evaluation had 4 goals: (1) to determine how well the learning objectives were met; (2) to evaluate individual components of the course to improve subsequent offerings; (3) to determine whether additional topics needed to be added; and (4) to evaluate the effectiveness of the discussion forum component of the course. Learner self-efficacy improved within all competency areas but especially those of practice-based learning and system-based practice. Evaluation results led to curriculum revision that has maintained course relevance and sustained it within the larger geriatrics fellowship curriculum. Components of this course can be easily adapted to other curricular settings for fellows and residents.

Bologna was inoculated with L. monocytogenes exposed to 1 of 6 treatments: 3 packaging treatments (100% CO2, air, vacuum), each with and without nisin. Bologna was refrigerated and sampled 9 times over 42 d. Nisin reduced initial L. monocytogenes populations by 1.5 to 2 log cycles and 100% CO2 packaging prevented outgrowth throughout 42 d of storage, whereas non-CO2 packaging displayed a 2-log increase in population during storage. Nisin (500 IU/mL) combined with 100% CO2 was effective in reducing Listeria and preventing outgrowth on bologna over 42 d of refrigerated storage.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0032-5791			WOS:000320443400028	23776282

This paper summarizes the theory and recent work applying the stress-energy method and different curve fit models to corrugated board for generating cushion curves. This paper also compares stress-energy predicted deceleration values to actual ASTM D1596 deceleration values as a method of determining whether the stress-energy method is a viable alternative for generating cushion curves for corrugated board. The results of this Study suggest that the stress-energy method should not yet be recommended for generating cushion curves for corrugated board.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0090-3973			WOS:000321725300009

Temporal Analysis of Field, SSURGO, and LiDAR-Derived Site Indices in the Southeastern United States								SOIL SCIENCE				178	7			325	334		10.1097/SS.0b013e3182a743e5			JUL 2013	2013	Sustainable forest and soil management requires accurate information about site index (tree height at a base age). The objectives of this study were to compare site indices from field inventory data (2008-2009), Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO), and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and to determine the uncertainty in the site indices from the southern part of the Clemson Experimental Forest. When LiDAR-derived analysis was used to compare with SSURGO, there were statistical differences for site indices for all of the tree species in this study: loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea), shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata), white oak (Quercus alba), and yellow poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera). The LiDAR has the potential to provide reliable and rapid estimates of site index variability within the soil map units. Loblolly pine and shortleaf pine had the greatest statistical differences, with the LiDAR-derived site indices being much larger than the SSURGO values. The results of this study indicate that a larger sample size for LiDAR is a better option to decrease variation and that the map unit level may be the best option.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0038-075X	1538-9243		WOS:000330320500001

J	Gallagher, Colin; Lund, Robert; Robbins, Michael								Changepoint Detection in Climate Time Series with Long-Term Trends								JOURNAL OF CLIMATE				26	14			4994	5006		10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00704.1			JUL 2013	2013	Climate time series often have artificial shifts induced by instrumentation changes, station relocations, observer changes, etc. Climate time series also often exhibit long-term trends. Much of the recent literature has focused on identifying the structural breakpoint time(s) of climate time series-the so-called changepoint problem. Unfortunately, application of rudimentary mean-shift changepoint tests to scenarios with trends often leads to the erroneous conclusion that a mean shift occurred near the series' center. This paper examines this problem in detail, constructing some simple homogeneity tests for series with trends. The asymptotic distribution of the proposed statistic is derived; en route, an attempt is made to unify the asymptotic properties of the changepoint methods used in today's climate literature. The tests presented here are linked to the ubiquitous t test. Application is made to two temperature records: 1) the continental United States record and 2) a local record from Jacksonville, Illinois.									11	0	0	1	0	11			0894-8755	1520-0442		WOS:000330515400007

Educators in travel and tourism fields have also begun to explore the potential of virtual learning in Second Life and take advantage of as effective virtual environment to obtain best results in the learning process. The main goal of the present study is to develop a research framework identifying the factors affecting student learning experience within a 3D virtual world by examining he applicability of the Self-Determination Theory and the construct of positive emotions. The data collection was conducted in April, 2011. The participants were recruited from an introductory PRTM course and a tourism marketing class in the Department of Park, Recreation and Tourism Management at a University in the Southeast region of the United States. From a theoretical point of view, this study represents an empirical application of self-determination theory that is a theoretical and practical framework to examine how the satisfaction of the psychological needs of autonomy and relatedness in a 3D virtual world context makes a contribution to intrinsic motivation. Additionally, the present study explores the role and significance of positive emotion in the context of virtual learning. For tourism educators, this study can be applied to build the connection between tourism education and virtual worlds in the development of how to construct engaging and interactive learning experiences to meet the expectations of learners.

To address such problems, decomposition of the original or "all-in-one" (AiO) problem into smaller and simpler subproblems is the approach taken by engineers. Analytical target cascading (ATC), a hierarchical decomposition and coordination approach, is extended to model and coordinate problems with nonhierarchical interactions among the subproblems. Convergence results for ATC based on Lagrangian duality theory are extended for the new approach. Under certain conditions, the optimal solution of the AiO problem can be achieved by independently solving the nonhierarchically interacting subproblems. A mathematical example with several subproblems interacting in a network is included and new applications in engineering design are highlighted. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Prospective Predictors of Technology-Based Sexual Coercion by College Males								PSYCHOLOGY OF VIOLENCE				3	3			233	246		10.1037/a0030904			JUL 2013	2013	Objective: Technology-based coercive behavior (TBC) represents an emerging public health problem. This study contributes to the literature by identifying prospective individual-, social-, and community-level predictors of TBC. Method: Data were collected from 795 men who participated in a prospective study on attitudes and behaviors regarding relationships with women. Variables across multiple ecological layers were used to predict TBC. Results: Bivariate analyses indicated that most all of the assessed risk variables across all three ecological domains significantly predicted TBC. Multivariate regression analyses indicated five variables uniquely accounted for TBC behaviors, including rape supportive beliefs, peer approval of forced sex, number of sexual partners, exposure to pornography, and participation in student government. Conclusions: Our findings that TBC can be prospectively predicted by these risk factors suggest that computer-based technology interventions focusing on these factors through social network ads that promote reflection on healthy social and romantic relationship behaviors and attitudes could help prevent and reduce TBC.									4	0	0	0	0	4			2152-0828	2152-081X		WOS:000326562800005	24073356

Method: Our analytic sample consisted of 795 men who participated in a longitudinal study on high-risk behaviors among college students. The sample was surveyed at the end of each of their 4 years at university on a variety of measures, including sexual aggression (SA) and its hypothesized risk factors (hostile masculinity, number of sexual partners, alcohol misuse, and peer norms). Results: Using latent growth mixture modeling, we found four distinct SA trajectories: (a) consistently high, (b) decreasing, (c) increasing, and (d) consistently low. Multinomial logistic regression revealed that hostile masculinity and peer norms positively predicted trajectory membership at times when each trajectory reflected a high level of SA. Conclusions: Our study adds to the knowledge base by elucidating the different ways sexually aggressive behaviors change during emerging adulthood and how confluence-model-derived factors predict the different trajectories. The finding that changes over time in these risk factors correspond with SA perpetration risk informs prevention programming by illuminating the importance of continual focus on these risk factors throughout the college years, perhaps through annual self-assessments.									20	0	0	5	0	20			2152-0828	2152-081X		WOS:000326562800006	23914305

During fieldwork from 1998 to 2011, the rhopalid's host plants were recorded (124 collections) in Arizona, Colorado, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, and Wyoming. Twenty-six species of the subfamily Asteroideae on which nymphs, mating pairs, or both were found are considered host plants; 25 are new host records. Adults were taken on 12 additional species of asteroid Asteraceae. Host composites were white- and yellow-rayed herbs and subshrubs (Ericameria nauseosa is a shrub) that are mainly perennial. The Astereae (11 spp.) and Helenieae (7 spp.) were best represented among asteroid tribes that the rhopalid used as hosts; other host tribes were Anthemideae (1 species), Bahieae (2 spp.), Heliantheae (1 species), Madieae (1 species), Senecioniae (2 spp.), and Tageteae (1 species). In the Astereae, hosts mainly were in the subtribe Machaerantherinae (5 spp.); in the Helenieae, all seven hosts were in the subtribe Tetraneuriinae. Composite tribes such as Cardueae, Cichorieae, Eupatorieae, and Gnaphalieae were not among the rhopalid's observed hosts. Records of H. reflexulus from non-asteraceous families are considered incidental or to reflect only a use for shelter or adult feeding.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0013-8797			WOS:000322608300005

Image denoising algorithm based on contourlet transform for optical coherence tomography heart tube image								IET IMAGE PROCESSING				7	5			442	450		10.1049/iet-ipr.2013.0127			JUL 2013	2013	Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is becoming an increasingly important imaging technology in the Biomedical field. However, the application of OCT is limited by the ubiquitous noise. In this study, the noise of OCT heart tube image is first verified as being multiplicative based on the local statistics (i.e. the linear relationship between the mean and the standard deviation of certain flat area). The variance of the noise is evaluated in log-domain. Based on these, a joint probability density function is constructed to take the inter-direction dependency in the contourlet domain from the logarithmic transformed image into account. Then, a bivariate shrinkage function is derived to denoise the image by the maximum a posteriori estimation. Systemic comparative experiments are made to synthesis images, OCT heart tube images and other OCT tissue images by subjective assessment and objective metrics. The experiment results are analysed based on the denoising results and the predominance degree of the proposed algorithm with respect to the wavelet-based algorithm. The results show that the proposed algorithm improves the signal-to-noise ratio, whereas preserving the edges and has more advantages on the images containing multi-direction information like OCT heart tube image.									1	3	0	0	0	4			1751-9659	1751-9667		WOS:000326403100005	27087835	
J	Khodorkovsky, Yuri; Manson, J.

The pulses modify the rotational state of the molecules, causing their field-free alignment, or a rotation with a preferred sense. We show that field-free laser-induced molecular alignment leads to correlation between the scattering angle and the sense of rotation of the scattered molecules. Moreover, by controlling the sense of laser-induced unidirectional molecular rotation, one may affect the scattering angle of the molecules. This provides a new means for separation of mixtures of molecules (such as isotopes and nuclear-spin isomers) by laser-controlled surface scattering.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0026-8976	1362-3028		WOS:000326071500009

Large-Scale Circulation in a Rectangular Enclosure With Periodic Boundary Temperature								JOURNAL OF FLUIDS ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME				135	7					071201	10.1115/1.4024011			JUL 2013	2013	An experiment in a rectangular basin of water is used to demonstrate that a large-scale circulation will result from a zero-mean thermal forcing. The thermal force is a spatially periodic pattern of heating and cooling at the top surface, achieved with an interdigitated array of hot and cold tubes. The experimental results show a very robust, steady flow with ascending flows at each end of the tank and a single descending jet near the left wall. These results suggest that small-scale forcing in surface-driven flows may result in significant large-scale subsurface motion.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0098-2202	1528-901X		WOS:000326104000006

The Student Services Committee (SSC) of the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors (AEESP) organized a workshop to fill some of the need. Newly hired faculty and experienced search committee and department chairs shared information on how to create competitive applications. Students and postdoctoral associates were also provided with individualized feedback on their faculty application packages. Survey data were collected for all participants, and these data are presented in this paper along with tips shared during the workshop and information collected from the literature. The objective of this paper is to share that information (1)to inform applicants (students and postdoctoral associates) about the academic job search process, and (2)to inform mentors about how to mentor applicants. Survey responses revealed that participants felt they learned valuable information about the job search process. They found the personalized feedback on application packages to be the most helpful activity; other mentors are encouraged to provide similar personalized feedback. A wiki website component included in the workshop was effective at engaging the participants and helped broaden the impact beyond the workshop attendees. Key lessons learned by comparing workshop results with literature were the importance of fit, the unique diversity of environmental engineering, mentoring and networking, Ph.D. planning sessions, being informed, and becoming a more skilled candidate. The recommendations presented in this paper can be used by students, postdoctoral associates, and their mentors to facilitate the candidate's path toward academia.

The product was divided into four parts, and then C-60 was added to three of these four parts at 1, 2, and 3 mass%, respectively. Each part was hot-pressed at 150 MPa and 923 K. The sample with 1% C-60 was characterized via a Rietveld refinement and TEM analyses. Measurements of the three thermoelectric key properties revealed that the Seebeck coefficient barely depends on the carbon amount added, while both the electrical and the thermal conductivity decrease with increasing amount of carbon. Depending on the amount of C-60 used and on the temperature, the thermoelectric performance was either enhanced or decreased, depending on whether the electrical conductivity decreased less or more than the thermal conductivity. At the highest temperature measured, all carbon-containing samples performed better than the unmodified bulk sample, namely up to 14%. These improvements are within the error margin, however.

A subgrid stabilization finite element method for incompressible magnetohydrodynamics								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER MATHEMATICS				90	7			1506	1523		10.1080/00207160.2012.758363			JUL 1 2013	2013	This paper studies a numerical scheme for approximating solutions of incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations that uses eddy viscosity stabilization only on the small scales of the fluid flow. This stabilization scheme for MHD equations uses a Galerkin finite element spatial discretization with Scott-Vogelius mixed finite elements and semi-implicit backward Euler temporal discretization. We prove its unconditional stability and prove how the coarse mesh can be chosen so that optimal convergence can be achieved. We also provide numerical experiments to confirm the theory and demonstrate the effectiveness of the scheme on a test problem for MHD channel flow.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0020-7160	1029-0265		WOS:000322091700030

Our study represents the first data and discussion on marine turtle distribution, abundance, and health at a marine turtle foraging ground in the central Pacific, Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, which constitutes a regionally important mixed-size-class foraging ground for green turtles (Chelonia mydas) and, to a lesser extent, for hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata). Surveys and anecdotal reports suggest that nesting activity is rare, and we have confirmed the presence of limited suitable nesting habitat. During in-water activities from 2008 to 2011, we caught 211 green turtles ranging from postpelagic juveniles to adults (weight: mean = 44.6 kg, range = 7.2-146.3 kg; curved carapace length (CCL): mean = 69.7 cm, range = 41.0-113.6 cm) and 2 juvenile hawksbills (weight(2009) = 16.3 kg, CCL2009 = 57.0; weight(2011) = 11.2 kg, CCL2011 = 50.5 cm). Body condition indices did not significantly differ by year of capture. These indices, along with the absence of observed fibropapilloma tumors, indicated that turtles at Palmyra Atoll were on average in very good condition. We also conducted 11 relative abundance surveys from 2005 to 2011, a subset of which revealed an uneven distribution of turtles around Palmyra Atoll with 3 hot spots of turtle abundance off the flats to the north, south, and east. By linking several aspects of our research program with similar efforts at foraging grounds throughout the Pacific Basin, we can further our understanding of poorly known regional migratory connectivity.									7	0	0	7	0	7			1071-8443	1943-3956		WOS:000322330100003

Across a 7-yr posteradication (glyphosate + imazapyr) "recovery chronosequence," which included untreated cogongrass, uninvaded reference, and treated plots, we analyzed soils for total N, potentially available P (Mehlich-1 [M1]), pH, and organic matter content. We also used resin bags to assess fluxes of plant available N and P in the soil solution. Additionally, we used litterbags to monitor the decomposition and nutrient mineralization patterns of dead rhizome and foliage tissue. Our results indicate similar total N and M1-P contents in both cogongrass-invaded and uninvaded reference plots, with levels of M1-P being lower than in cogongrass plots for 5 yr after eradication. Soil organic matter did not differ between treatments. Resin bag analyses suggest that cogongrass invasion did not affect soil nitrate availability, although a pulse of NO2 + NO3 occurred in the first 3 yr after eradication. No such trends were observed for ammonium. Resin-adsorbed PO4 was lowest 3 yr after eradication, and pH was highest 5 yr after eradication. Our litterbag study showed that approximately 55% of foliar biomass and 23% of rhizome tissue biomass remained 18 mo after herbicide treatment. Substantial N immobilization was observed in rhizomes for the first 12 mo, with slow mineralization occurring thereafter. Rapid P mineralization occurred, with 15.4 and 20.5% of initial P remaining after 18 mo in rhizomes and foliage, respectively. Overall, our findings indicate that cogongrass invasion has little to no effect on soil nutrient cycling processes, although some significant-but ephemeral-alterations develop after eradication.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1939-7291			WOS:000324346900012

The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of various WMA additives on the moisture susceptibility of mixtures containing moist aggregates following a long-term aging process. Mass loss (percentage), indirect tensile strength (ITS) of dry and conditioned specimens, deformation (flow), and dissipated energy values were measured. The experimental design included two aggregate moisture contents (0% and approximately 0.5% by weight of the dry mass of the aggregate), two lime contents (1 and 2% lime by weight of dry aggregate), one liquid antistripping agent (ASA), five WMA additives, and two aggregate sources. A common long-term aging procedure was used in this study. The test results indicated that long-term aging improved the moisture resistance of WMA mixtures regardless of WMA additive, ASA, and moisture content. In addition, aggregate source affected the moisture resistance regardless of WMA additive, ASA, and aggregate moisture content. The effects of various WMA additives on the dissipated fracture energy of unaged mixtures are generally similar except that mixtures with Asphamin have relatively lower dry dissipated fracture energy. In addition, the aggregate type affected the dissipated energy value of WMA mixtures regardless of aging states.									6	0	0	0	1	6			0899-1561			WOS:000323214400014

However, the in vivo kinetic behaviors of these particles that are necessary for clinical translation are poorly understood to date. In this study, fluorescent carbon dots (C-dots) were synthesized and the effect of three injection routes on their fate in vivo was explored by using both near-infrared fluorescence and positron emission tomography imaging techniques. We found that C-dots are efficiently and rapidly excreted from the body after all three injection routes. The clearance rate of C-dots is ranked as intravenous > intramuscular > subcutaneous. The particles had relatively low retention in the reticuloendothelial system and showed high tumor-to-background contrast. Furthermore, different injection routes also resulted in different blood clearance patterns and tumor uptakes of C-dots. These results satisfy the need for clinical translation and should promote efforts to further investigate the possibility of using carbon-based nanoprobes in a clinical setting. More broadly, we provide a testing blueprint for in vivo behavior of nanoplatforms under various injection routes, an important step forward toward safety and efficacy analysis of nanoparticles.									74	4	0	23	0	77			1936-0851			WOS:000322417400006	23731122

Synthesis and Enhanced Colloidal Stability of Cationic Gold Nanoparticles using Polyethyleneimine and Carbon Dioxide								ACS SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY & ENGINEERING				1	7			826	832		10.1021/sc400028t			JUL 2013	2013	Employing green methods in the design and synthesis of functionalized metallic nanoparticles poses significant challenges in terms of maintaining product integrity (size, shape, dispersity, and colloidal stability). In this study, the direct synthesis of cationic gold nanoparticles (GNPs) capped by low molecular weight (M-w similar to 600) polyethylenimine was investigated. Specifically, three separate HAuCl4 reduction pathways were used to produce robust GNPs with sizes ranging from 4 to 20 nm in diameter with excellent size control. The inclusion of carbon dioxide as a nontoxic, nonflammable, and inexpensive component led to decreases in particle size and an increase in the colloidal stability of the GNPs. Furthermore, the thermally reversible reaction of CO2 with amines provides means to control the solvent pH through carbamate structures and, hence, the controllable formation of particle aggregates. The effects of pH, PEI concentration, and reduction method on the particle core size and stability were determined via transmission electron microscopy, UVvis absorption spectra, and dynamic light scattering.									9	0	0	1	0	9			2168-0485			WOS:000321472200017

The central field of the Andromeda galaxy (M 31) was monitored from 2006 to 2012 using the Chandra HRC-I detector (about 0.1-10 keV energy range) with the main aim of detecting X-rays from optical novae. We present a systematic analysis of all X-ray sources found in the 41 nova monitoring observations, along with 23 M 31 central field HRC-I observations available from the Chandra data archive starting in December 1999.Aims. Based on these observations, we studied the X-ray long-term variability of the source population and especially of X-ray binaries in M 31.Methods. We created a catalogue of sources detected in the 64 available observations that adds up to a total exposure time of about 1 Ms. To study the variability, we developed a processing pipeline to derive long-term Chandra HRC-I light curves for each source over the 13 years of observations. We also searched for extended X-ray sources in the merged images.Results. We present a point-source catalogue containing 318 X-ray sources with detailed long-term variability information, 28 of which are published for the first time. The spatial and temporal resolution of the catalogue allows us to classify 115 X-ray binary candidates showing high X-ray variability or even outbursts, as well as 14 globular cluster X-ray binary candidates showing no significant variability. The analysis may suggest that outburst sources are less frequent in globular clusters than in the field of M 31. We detected seven supernova remnants, one of which is a new candidate, and also resolved the first X-rays from a known radio supernova remnant. In addition to 33 known optical nova/X-ray source correlations, we discovered one previously unknown super-soft X-ray outburst and several new nova candidates.Conclusions. The catalogue contains a large sample of detailed long-term X-ray light curves in the M 31 central field, which helps in understanding the X-ray population of our neighbouring spiral galaxy M 31.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0004-6361			WOS:000322008600065

Yb-doped fiber lasers have become ubiquitous, and the results presented here may be used to design lasers and amplifiers for narrow linewidth systems and applications. It is found, with a high degree of certainty, that Yb2O3 has an acoustic velocity that is lower than that of silica, a Brillouin spectral width (or material acoustic damping coefficient) that is about 80 times greater than that of silica, and photoelastic constants (Pockets' coefficients) that are negative. It is found that the primary influence of ytterbia in concentrations typical of active fibers is to broaden the Brillouin gain spectrum, thereby reducing the peak Brillouin gain. A set of design curves is provided outlining the Brillouin gain coefficient as a function of alumina concentration for several ytterbia concentrations, which can be utilized to design fiber structures with reduced Brillouin gain. The Yb-doped aluminosilicate fiber system is compared to the Yb-doped phosphosilicate system, and a high degree of similarity is found between them at low Al2O3 or P2O5 doping levels. However, for fiber produced utilizing conventional techniques, the phosphosilicates are found to have the potential for lower Brillouin gain since more P2O5 can be reliably incorporated into the glassy matrix.

Liquid and supercritical CO2 extraction of fat from rendered materials								JOURNAL OF SUPERCRITICAL FLUIDS				79		SI		55	61		10.1016/j.supflu.2013.01.022			JUL 2013	2013	The separation of fat from rendered materials has potential for value-added products, fuels and feed sources for animals. Current industrial processes utilize continuous screw pressing to extract fat from rendered materials, but the ability to minimize residual fat content is limited. In this work, liquid and supercritical CO2 were used to extract the remaining fat from rendered poultry meal. CO2 extraction offers high extraction yields with potential ecological and economic benefits for the rendering industry. A semi-batch extraction unit was used to investigate the effect of pressure (69-345 bar), temperature (25 degrees C, 40 degrees C and 50 degrees C), flow rate, and mass of CO2 on the extraction yield and the fat solubility. Maximum extraction yields between 87% and 97% were obtained which produced a remaining fat content of 1.0 +/- 0.3 wt% in the extracted poultry meal. Fat solubility increased with pressure but decreased with temperature, providing liquid CO2 with the highest fat solubility (6.47 g/L) at 25 degrees C and 345 bar. The Chrastil model successfully correlated the solubility data as a function of density and temperature, obtaining an AARD value of 5.56%. Gas chromatography was used to analyze the composition of fatty acids, obtaining similar results with those reported in the literature. It can be concluded that high fat extraction yields can be obtained using CO2 and that liquid CO2 is more effective than supercritical CO2 for the extraction of rendered fats under the conditions tested.

Fractionation of an oligomeric pyrene pitch via supercritical extraction								JOURNAL OF SUPERCRITICAL FLUIDS				79		SI		170	176		10.1016/j.supflu.2012.11.015			JUL 2013	2013	Semi-continuous, packed-column supercritical extraction was investigated for the fractionation of a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) pitch into its constituent oligomers. The starting pitch had been produced by the catalytic polymerization of pure pyrene using AlCl3. Although neat supercritical toluene (T-c=318.6 degrees C; P-c=41.1 bar) was shown to be an effective solvent for the recovery of both monomer and dimer cuts in high purities, higher-oligomer solubilities in toluene are notoriously low. However, the addition of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) as a co-solvent enhanced oligomer solubilities in the extractive, supercritical-solvent phase by a factor of 3, making possible the recovery of trimer and higher oligomers. An unexpected benefit of the use of NMP is that it was found to suppress the condensation reaction between toluene and the pyrene oligomers - apparently by forming a Lewis acid-base complex with the AlC3 catalyst - that can occur in the extraction column at temperatures above 350 degrees C.

J	Hart, Ashley E.; Akers, David B.; Gorosh, Samuel; Kitchens, Christopher L.								Reverse micelle synthesis of silver nanoparticles in gas expanded liquids								JOURNAL OF SUPERCRITICAL FLUIDS				79		SI		236	243		10.1016/j.supflu.2013.02.014			JUL 2013	2013	The tunable solvent properties of gas expanded liquids (GXLs) have been previously used for the fractionation and separation of polydispersed ligand-stabilized metal nanoparticles into distinct monodispersed fractions. This work employs CO2 expanded hexane for silver nanoparticle synthesis within an AOT reverse micelle system where the tunable GXL solvent properties are used to control the nanoparticle size and polydispersity. The objective of this project is to answer two questions: (1) can nanoparticles with narrow and well-defined size distributions be synthesized in GXLs? and (2) how do the solvent properties impact the resulting nanoparticle size? In the reverse micelle synthesis, the AOT surfactant provides a nano-scale aqueous micelle core for nanoparticle nucleation, as well as, acts as a nanoparticle stabilizing ligand. Increasing the CO2 partial pressure in a GXL impacts the surfactant-solvent interaction and results in the synthesis of different sized nanoparticles. At ambient pressures, the mean particle diameter synthesized was 6.1 +/- 2.1 nm with W=40 and 5.4 +/- 2.0 nm with W=20, where W is the molar ratio of water to AOT. At CO2 partial pressures of 6.9 and 13.8 bar, there was no significant change in particle size, but decreases in the size distributions were observed. At CO2 partial pressures ranging from 20.7 to 41.4 bar, steady decreases in the mean particle diameter and size distribution were observed with values of 4.0 +/- 0.8 for W=40 and 4.1 +/- 1.0 for W=20 at 41.4 bar. This demonstrates some degree of nanoparticle size tunability within the GXL solvent, where smaller particle diameters and size distributions are achieved at higher CO2 compositions.

The results of the testing have been particularly encouraging for samples and artifacts made of iron and its alloys. The most recent work has entailed desalination of multiple artifacts within one batch, such as wrought iron ballast blocks from the submarine H.L. Hunley (1864), and miscellaneous artifacts of varying composition, context and state of preservation from the National Park Service (NPS) collection. It is suggested, that subcritical conditions significantly enhance the characteristics of a desalination solution through the decrease of viscosity, density and surface tension, thus resulting in improved diffusion constants of the anionic exchange of chloride and hydroxide ions. In addition, long-term stability appears to be enhanced by transformation of corrosion products into more stable forms. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Over the years, various techniques designed to conserve waterlogged wood have been applied to cork with less than satisfactory results. These techniques include freeze drying with or without consolidant, air-drying and silicone oil treatment. Alternatively, recent studies demonstrated that methanol exchange followed by supercritical CO2 drying can overcome most of the limitations of the latter techniques when applied to organic waterlogged materials. In 2005, a joint research project was initiated between the Warren Lasch Conservation Center (WLCC) and Parks Canada to evaluate the use of supercritical CO2 drying on significant archaeological corks and composite artifacts from several shipwrecks. This paper will discuss the drying process of the various corks and the techniques employed to monitor their appearance and dimensions, namely conventional measurement techniques and structured-light 3D scanning combined with three-dimensional inspection.

Although magnetic force has long been used to enrich magnetic (or magnetically tagged) particles in suspensions, magnetic concentration of diamagnetic particles is relatively new and little reported. We demonstrate in this work a simple magnetic technique to concentrate polystyrene particles and live yeast cells in ferrofluid flow through a straight rectangular microchannel using negative magnetophoresis. The magnetic field gradient is created by two attracting permanent magnets that are placed on the top and bottom of the planar microfluidic device and held in position by their natural attractive force. The magnet-magnet distance is mainly controlled by the thickness of the device substrate and can be made small, allowing for the use of a dilute ferrofluid in the developed magnetic concentration technique. This advantage not only enables a magnetic/fluorescent label-free handling of diamagnetic particles, but also renders such handling biocompatible.									18	0	0	8	0	18			1613-4982			WOS:000322322200005		
J	Baratian-Ghorghi, Z.; Kaye, N. B.					Kaye, Nigel/0000-0001-7190-7791			Modeling the purging of dense fluid from a street canyon driven by an interfacial mixing flow and skimming flow								PHYSICS OF FLUIDS				25	7					076603	10.1063/1.4813786			JUL 2013	2013	An experimental study is presented to investigate the mechanism of flushing a trapped dense contaminant from a canyon by turbulent boundary layer flow. The results of a series of steady-state experiments are used to parameterize the flushing mechanisms. The steady-state experimental results for a canyon with aspect ratio one indicate that dense fluid is removed from the canyon by two different processes, skimming of dense fluid from the top of the dense layer; and by an interfacial mixing flow that mixes fresh fluid down into the dense lower layer (entrainment) while mixing dense fluid into the flow above the canyon (detrainment). A model is developed for the time varying buoyancy profile within the canyon as a function of the Richardson number which parameterizes both the interfacial mixing and skimming processes observed. The continuous release steady-state experiments allowed for the direct measurement of the skimming and interfacial mixing flow rates for any layer depth and Richardson number. Both the skimming rate and the interfacial mixing rate were found to be power-law functions of the Richardson number of the layer. The model results were compared to the results of previously published finite release experiments [Z. Baratian-Ghorghi and N. B. Kaye, Atmos. Environ. 60, 392-402 (2012)]. A high degree of consistency was found between the finite release data and the continuous release data. This agreement acts as an excellent check on the measurement techniques used, as the finite release data was based on curve fitting through buoyancy versus time data, while the continuous release data was calculated directly by measuring the rate of addition of volume and buoyancy once a steady-state was established. Finally, a system of ordinary differential equations is presented to model the removal of dense fluid from the canyon based on empirical correlations of the skimming and interfacial mixing taken form the steady-state experiments. The ODE model predicts well the time taken for a finite volume of dense fluid to be flushed from a canyon. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1070-6631			WOS:000322521100058		
J	Baugh, Patrick; King, Jeremy R.; Deliyannis, Constantine P.; Boesgaard, Merchant								A Spectroscopic Analysis of the Eclipsing Short-Period Binary V505 Persei and the Origin of the Lithium Dip								PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC				125	929			753	758		10.1086/671721			JUL 2013	2013	As a test of rotationally-induced mixing causing the well-known Li dip in older mid-F dwarfs in the local Galactic disk, we utilize high-resolution and -signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) Keck/HIRES spectroscopy to measure the Li abundance in the components of the similar to 1 Gyr, [Fe/H] = -0.15 eclipsing short-period binary V505 Per. We find A(Li) similar to 2.7 +/- 0.1 and 2.4 +/- 0.2 in the T-eff similar to 6500 and 6450 K primary and secondary components, respectively. Previous T-eff determinations and uncertainties suggest that each component is located in the midst of the Li dip. If so, their A(Li) are >= 2-5 times larger than A(Li) detections and upper limits observed in the similar metallicity and intermediate-age open clusters NGC 752 and 3680, as well as the more metal-rich and younger Hyades and Praesepe. These differences are even larger if the consistent estimates of the scaling of initial Li with metallicity inferred from nearby disk stars, open clusters, and recent Galactic chemical evolution models are correct. Our results suggest, independently of complementary evidence based on Li/Be ratios, Be/B ratios, and Li in subgiants evolving out of the Li dip, that main-sequence angular momentum evolution is the origin of the Li dip. Specifically, our stars' A(Li) indicates that tidal synchronization can be sufficiently efficient and occur early enough in short-period binary mid-F stars to reduce the effects of rotationally-induced mixing and destruction of Li occurring during the main-sequence in otherwise similar stars that are not short-period tidally-locked binaries.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0004-6280			WOS:000322217800002

Management of Daylily Rust with Different Fungicides and Application Methods								PLANT DISEASE				97	7			921	926		10.1094/PDIS-12-12-1127-RE			JUL 2013	2013	The objectives of this study were to assess the efficacy of various fungicides applied as root dips, soil drenches, or foliar sprays to daylily plants grown in containers and planted in the field to manage rust caused by Puccinia hemerocallidis. Soil drenches and foliar sprays were evaluated in field experiments in Griffin, GA in 2010 and 2011. Dipping bare-root daylily plants for 5 min in azoxystrobin, tebuconazole, or thiophanate-methyl significantly reduced lesion development compared with nontreated control plants. Drenches with azoxystrobin, fluoxastrobin, or tebuconazole, each at three rates (0.06, 0.12, and 0.24 g of active ingredient [a.i.]/container), significantly reduced development of rust lesions on container-grown daylily plants for up to 9 weeks after treatment and 6 weeks after inoculation. One early-season drench of azoxystrobin at 0.12 g a.i../plant provided season-long reduction in disease incidence and disease progress that was comparable with foliar sprays with azoxystrobin or chlorothalonil applied at 14-day intervals. Dip or drench applications of fungicides would allow growers to diversify rust management options and could reduce the number of foliar fungicide applications.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0191-2917			WOS:000320678800008

Does it matter for state taxes whether the governor is a Democrat or Republican and whether she is eligible for re-election or faces a binding term limit? Using a Regression Discontinuity Design and a panel of U.S. states, we find that the manner in which governors of different parties implement different tax policies turns crucially on the incumbent's eligibility for re-election. Re-electable Democratic governors increase income taxes relative to similarly situated Republicans, yielding divergence between party policy positions. However, governors facing a binding term limit exhibit the reverse policy difference, resulting in a movement of policy back together.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0038-4038			WOS:000321988100006

The purpose of this paper is to spotlight the process of a completely integrated V&V procedure, as it is applied to a wind turbine blade. The novelty, besides illustrating the application of V&V to blade modeling, is to challenge the conventional separation between verification and validation activities. First, simple closed-form solutions for bending stress, torsional stress and mode shapes of a hollow cylinder are derived analytically to verify the ANSYS finite element software. Shell-281 elements are used to approximate these closed-form solutions and demonstrate that the software runs properly. The grid convergence index is used to quantify the degree of numerical uncertainty that results. Next, model development and verification activities are applied to the CX-100 blade designed at the Sandia National Laboratories. A three-dimensional model is developed based on the actual geometry of the CX-100 blade. For simplicity, the model assumes smeared cross sections with uniform, isotropic material properties. Solution verification is performed to quantify the numerical uncertainty due to mesh discretization of the finite element model. The mesh refinement study provides evidence that the model leads to numerical solutions located in the regime of asymptotic convergence. We depart from the conventional V&V paradigm by proposing that the level of mesh discretization should be based on an assessment of experimental variability. Instead of choosing the mesh size in a vacuum', it is selected such that the overall numerical uncertainty caused by truncation effects is similar to, or smaller than, the test-to-test variability. This rationale guarantees that predictions are sufficiently accurate relative to the level of uncertainty with which physical tests can be replicated. Part II of this work highlights the V&V steps implemented to quantify sensitivities of the model and further quantify the prediction uncertainty caused by our imperfect knowledge of the idealized material description.

J	Van Buren, Kendra L.; Mollineaux, Mark G.; Hemez, Francois M.; Atamturktur, Sezer					Hemez, Francois/0000-0002-5319-4078			Simulating the dynamics of wind turbine blades: partII, model validation and uncertainty quantification								WIND ENERGY				16	5			741	758		10.1002/we.1522			JUL 2013	2013	Verification and validation (V&V) offers the potential to play an indispensable role in the development of credible models for the simulation of wind turbines. This paper highlights the development of a three-dimensional finite element model of the CX-100 wind turbine blade. The scientific hypothesis that we wish to confirm by applying V&V activities is that it is possible to develop a fast-running model capable of predicting the low-order vibration dynamics with sufficient accuracy. A computationally efficient model is achieved by segmenting the geometry of the blade into six sections only. It is further assumed that each cross section can be homogenized with isotropic material properties. The main objectives of V&V activities deployed are to, first, assess the extent to which these assumptions are justified and, second, to quantify the resulting prediction uncertainty. Designs of computer experiments are analyzed to understand the effects of parameter uncertainty and identify the significant sensitivities. A calibration of model parameters to natural frequencies predicted by the simplified model is performed in two steps with the use of, first, a free-free configuration of the blade and, second, a fixed-free configuration. This two-step approach is convenient to decouple the material properties from parameters of the model that describe the boundary condition. Here, calibration is not formulated as an optimization problem. Instead, it is viewed as a problem of inference uncertainty quantification where measurements are used to learn the uncertainty of model parameters. Gaussian process models, statistical tests and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling are combined to explore the (true but unknown) joint probability distribution of parameters that, when sampled, produces bounds of prediction uncertainty that are consistent with the experimental variability. An independent validation assessment follows the calibration and is applied to mode shape vectors. Despite the identification of isolated issues with the simulation code and model developed, the overarching conclusion is that the modeling strategy is sound and leads to an accurate-enough, fast-running simulation of blade dynamics. This publication is Part II of a two-part effort that highlights the V&V steps required to develop a robust model of a wind turbine blade, where Part I emphasizes code verification and the quantification of numerical uncertainty.

Fast, Accurate Event Classification on Resource-Lean Embedded Sensors								ACM TRANSACTIONS ON AUTONOMOUS AND ADAPTIVE SYSTEMS				8	2					11	10.1145/2491465.2491470			JUL 2013	2013	Due to the limited computational and energy resources available on existing wireless sensor platforms, achieving high-precision classification of high-level events in-network is a challenge. In this article, we present in-network implementations of a Bayesian classifier and a condensed kd-tree classifier for identifying events of interest on resource-lean embedded sensors. The first approach uses preprocessed sensor readings to derive a multidimensional Bayesian classifier used to classify sensor data in real time. The second introduces an innovative condensed kd-tree to represent preprocessed sensor data and uses a fast nearest-neighbor search to determine the likelihood of class membership for incoming samples. Both classifiers consume limited resources and provide high-precision classification. To evaluate each approach, two case studies are considered, in the contexts of human movement and vehicle navigation, respectively. The classification accuracy is above 85% for both classifiers across the two case studies.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1556-4665	1556-4703		WOS:000321905200005

THE EFFECT OF THE PRE-DETONATION STELLAR INTERNAL VELOCITY PROFILE ON THE NUCLEOSYNTHETIC YIELDS IN TYPE Ia SUPERNOVA								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				771	1					55	10.1088/0004-637X/771/1/55			JUL 1 2013	2013	A common model of the explosion mechanism of Type Ia supernovae is based on a delayed detonation of a white dwarf. A variety of models differ primarily in the method by which the deflagration leads to a detonation. A common feature of the models, however, is that all of them involve the propagation of the detonation through a white dwarf that is either expanding or contracting, where the stellar internal velocity profile depends on both time and space. In this work, we investigate the effects of the pre-detonation stellar internal velocity profile and the post-detonation velocity of expansion on the production of alpha-particle nuclei, including Ni-56, which are the primary nuclei produced by the detonation wave. We perform one-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the explosion phase of the white dwarf for center and off-center detonations with five different stellar velocity profiles at the onset of the detonation. In order to follow the complex flows and to calculate the nucleosynthetic yields, approximately 10,000 tracer particles were added to every simulation. We observe two distinct post-detonation expansion phases: rarefaction and bulk expansion. Almost all the burning to Ni-56 occurs only in the rarefaction phase, and its expansion timescale is influenced by pre-existing flow structure in the star, in particular by the pre-detonation stellar velocity profile. We find that the mass fractions of the alpha-particle nuclei, including Ni-56, are tight functions of the empirical physical parameter rho(up)/nu(down), where rho(up) is the mass density immediately upstream of the detonation wave front and nu(down) is the velocity of the flow immediately downstream of the detonation wave front. We also find that nu(down) depends on the pre-detonation flow velocity. We conclude that the properties of the pre-existing flow, in particular the internal stellar velocity profile, influence the final isotopic composition of burned matter produced by the detonation.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0004-637X			WOS:000321274200055

The structural and optical properties of the ZnO and IZO nanorods were investigated using field-emission scanning electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction (XRD), and photoluminescence (PL). The ZnO and IZO nanorods grew well aligned on the surface of the quartz substrates. From the XRD data, it can be seen that the In doping is responsible for the distortion of the ZnO lattice. The PL spectra show near-band-edge emission and deep-level emission, and they also show that In doping significantly affects the PL properties of ZnO nanorods.									4	1	0	1	0	5			1738-8090			WOS:000321958500032

By pulse electric fields (PEF) technology, the process of eggshell calcium citrate malate (ESCCM), eggshell calcium citrate (ESCC) and eggshells calcium malate (ESCM) were comprehensive compared. The levels of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and the bioavailability on mice fed with eggshell calcium citrate malate (ESCCM) treated by pulsed electric field (PEF) were evaluated. Results showed that the rates of calcium dissolution of the different acids studied can be arranged as ESCCM (7.90 mg/mL) > ESCC (7.12 mg/mL) > ESCM (7.08 mg/mL) from highest to lowest rate of dissolution. At the same dose 133.0 mg kg(-1) d(-1), the levels of TRAP in the ESCCM treatment groups were significantly lower than those in ESCM and ESCC (P < 0.05). Bone calcium content in the mice fed with ESCCM was generally higher than fed with ESCM and ESCC. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Quantum. Electron., 41, 849 (2010)]. The higher-order WASSS (HOWASSS) method approximates the Helmholtz equation by keeping terms up to third-order in the propagation step size, in the Magnus expansion. A symmetric exponential operator splitting technique is used to simplify the resulting exponential operators. The HOWASSS method is applied to the problem of waveguide propagation, where an analytical solution is known, to demonstrate the performance and accuracy of the method. The performance enhancement gained by implementing the HOWASSS method on a graphics processing unit (GPU) is demonstrated. When highly accurate results are required the HOWASSS method is shown to be substantially faster than the WASSS method.

We quantified soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) mineralization using seasonal in situ incubations of modified resin cores along spatial gradients of chronic salinification (from continuously freshwater tidal forest to salt impacted tidal forest to oligohaline marsh) and in hummocks and hollows of the continuously freshwater tidal forest along the blackwater Waccamaw River and alluvial Savannah River. Salinification increased rates of net N and P mineralization fluxes and turnover in tidal freshwater forested wetland soils, most likely through tree stress and senescence (for N) and conversion to oligohaline marsh (for P). Stimulation of N and P mineralization by chronic salinification was apparently unrelated to inputs of sulfate (for N and P) or direct effects of increased soil conductivity (for N). In addition, the tidal wetland soils of the alluvial river mineralized more P relative to N than the blackwater river. Finally, hummocks had much greater nitrification fluxes than hollows at the continuously freshwater tidal forested wetland sites. These findings add to knowledge of the responses of tidal freshwater ecosystems to sea level rise and salinification that is necessary to predict the consequences of state changes in coastal ecosystem structure and function due to global change, including potential impacts on estuarine eutrophication.									20	1	0	17	0	21			0168-2563			WOS:000320718200014

The tool was designed to assist utilities in calculating GHG emissions for the purposes of complying with future regulation and reporting requirements; providing information for city and state climate action plans, and fulfilling voluntary carbon emissions goals. For utilities. lacking accurate energy-use data, equations were developed to predict energy use for three phases of water production: raw water collection, water treatment, and finished water distribution. The tool was tested by seven Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina utilities, which had an average carbon intensity of 1,240 kg carbon dioxide-equivalents (CO2-eq)/mil gal when scope 1 and 2 emissions were evaluated. However, the averages ranged from 550 to 2,190 kg CO2-eq/mil gal, depending on the electrical grid used.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2164-4535			WOS:000321484600012

The structure of these materials features a weakly bonded van der Waals gap between covalently bonded CdI2-type atomic layers that may host a wide range of intercalants. Intercalation can profoundly affect the structural, thermal, and electronic properties of such materials. While the thermoelectric potential of layer-structured transition-metal dichalcogenides has been formerly studied by several groups, to our best knowledge, neither the thermoelectric properties of ZrSe2 nor the impact of intercalation on its thermoelectric properties have been reported (specifically, the full evaluation of the dimensionless figure of merit, ZT, which includes the thermal conductivity). In this proof-of-principle study, ZrSe2 single crystals have been synthesized using an iodine-assisted vapor transport method, followed by a wet-chemistry lithium intercalation process. The results of resistivity, thermopower, and thermal conductivity measurements between 10 K and 300 K show that Li intercalation induced additional charge carriers and structural disorder that favorably affected the thermoelectric properties of the material. As a result, a dimensionless figure of merit ZT a parts per thousand 0.26 has been attained at room temperature in a Li-intercalated sample, representing nearly a factor of three improvement compared with the pristine sample. These improvements, along with the abundance, relatively low toxicity, and low cost of such materials, merit further thermoelectric investigations of intercalated zirconium diselenide, especially in conjunction with a substitutional doping approach.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0361-5235			WOS:000320890800075		
J	Belotti, Pietro								Bound reduction using pairs of linear inequalities								JOURNAL OF GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION				56	3	SI		787	819		10.1007/s10898-012-9848-9			JUL 2013	2013	We describe a procedure to reduce variable bounds in mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) as well as mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problems. The procedure works by combining pairs of inequalities of a linear programming (LP) relaxation of the problem. This bound reduction procedure extends the feasibility based bound reduction technique on linear functions, used in MINLP and MILP. However, it can also be seen as a special case of optimality based bound reduction, a method to infer variable bounds from an LP relaxation of the problem. For an LP relaxation with m constraints and n variables, there are O(m (2)) pairs of constraints, and a na < ve implementation of our bound reduction scheme has complexity O(n (3)) for each pair. Therefore, its overall complexity O(m (2) n (3)) can be prohibitive for relatively large problems. We have developed a more efficient procedure that has complexity O(m (2) n (2)), and embedded it in two Open-Source solvers: one for MINLP and one for MILP. We provide computational results which substantiate the usefulness of this bound reduction technique for several instances.

Coarse-grained Molecular-level Analysis of Polyurea Properties and Shock-mitigation Potential								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				22	7	SI		1964	1981		10.1007/s11665-013-0485-3			JUL 2013	2013	Several experimental investigations reported in the open literature clearly established that polyurea (PU), an elastic copolymer, has an unusually high ability to attenuate and disperse shock waves. This behavior of PU is normally attributed to its unique nanometer-scale two-phase microstructure consisting of (high glass-transition temperature, T (g)) hydrogen-bonded discrete, hard domains dispersed within a (low T (g)) contiguous soft matrix. However, details regarding the mechanism(s) responsible for the superior shock-wave mitigation capacity of PU are still elusive. In the present study, molecular-level computational methods and tools are used to help us identify and characterize these mechanism(s). Because the shock-wave front structure and propagation involve coordinated motion of a large number of atoms and nano-second to micro-second characteristic times, these phenomena cannot be readily analyzed using all-atom molecular-level modeling and simulation techniques. To overcome this problem, all-atom PU microstructure is coarse-grained by introducing larger particles (beads), which account for the collective degrees of freedom of the constituent atoms, the associated force-field functions determined and parameterized using all-atom computational results, and the resulting coarse-grained model analyzed using conventional molecular-level computational methods and tools. The results thus obtained revealed that a combination of different deformation mechanisms (primarily shock-induced ordering and crystallization of hard domains and coordinated shuffle-like lateral motion of the soft-matrix segments) is most likely responsible for the superior ability of PU to attenuate/disperse shock waves.									12	1	0	1	0	13			1059-9495			WOS:000320671400021

In this work, incoherent light source based photoassisted metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) was used to deposit high quality Cu2O thin films on n-type < 100 > silicon and quartz substrates. X-ray diffraction studies reveal that crystalline Cu2O is deposited. UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy results indicated a band gap of 2.44 eV for Cu2O thin films. Transmission electron spectroscopy results show that the Cu2O film grows in the form of three-dimensional islands composed of smaller nanocrystalline grains in the range of 10-20 nm. I-V measurements indicate that the Cu2O/n-Si device fabricated using the MOCVD process has a lower dark current density than other devices reported in the literature.									11	0	0	0	0	11			0884-2914			WOS:000321204900015

Examining the Differential Effects of Incivility Versus Support on Mood, Energy, Engagement, and Performance in an Online Context								JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH PSYCHOLOGY				18	3			297	309		10.1037/a0032851			JUL 2013	2013	Existing research on workplace incivility has demonstrated an association with a host of negative outcomes, including increased burnout, turnover intentions, and physical symptoms. With the rise in Internet communication over the last decade, interpersonal mistreatment has spilled over to the Internet, but little is known about the impact of incivility communicated via e-mail on employee psychological and performance outcomes. The current study presents a within-subjects experiment wherein incivility and support were manipulated in a laboratory-based simulated workplace setting. Eighty-four participants completed a series of math tasks while interacting with either an uncivil or a supportive supervisor via e-mail. Data were collected on energy, cardiac activity, mood, task performance, and engagement. Findings indicate that participants reported higher levels of negative affect and lower levels of energy after working with the uncivil supervisor than with the supportive supervisor. Additionally, participants performed significantly worse on the math tasks and had lower engagement in the uncivil condition than the supportive condition, and these relationships were mediated by energy. No differences were found in cardiac activity between the two conditions. Results are discussed in terms of their implications for the 21st century world of work.									10	1	0	0	0	11			1076-8998			WOS:000321465000006	23834445

The purpose of the current study was to examine the effect of school-related factors on violent criminality in adulthood, based on data from the National Longitudinal Study on Adolescent Health. Logistic regression analyses indicated that behavioral variables (i.e., truancy, suspensions) and academic variables (i.e., grade retention and grades) significantly improved the prediction of criminal offending. The strongest predictor of violent criminal behavior in adulthood was repeating a grade at the secondary level. Practice implications are presented.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0741-9325			WOS:000321203300002

Acetolactate synthase (ALS)-inhibiting herbicides are effective for annual bluegrass control, but reliance on this mode of action can select for herbicide-resistant biotypes. Two annual bluegrass biotypes not controlled with ALS-inhibiting herbicides were reported at golf courses in South Carolina and Georgia. Research was initiated at Clemson University to verify the level of resistance of these biotypes to ALS inhibitors. Two ALS-susceptible (S) and suspected resistant (SCr, GAr) annual bluegrass biotypes were established in a greenhouse. Dose-response experiments were conducted on mature annual bluegrass plants using trifloxysulfuron, foramsulfuron, and bispyribac-sodium, all ALS-inhibiting herbicides. Additionally, a rapid diagnostic ALS activity assay was optimized and conducted using the same herbicides. For dose-response experiments, the rate of herbicide that reduced shoot biomass 50% (I-50) values for the S biotypes were 13.6 g ai ha(-1) trifloxysulfuron, 7.0 g ai ha(-1) for foramsulfuron, and 38.3 g ai ha(-1) for bispyribac-sodium. Fifty percent shoot biomass reduction was not observed in either the SCr or GAr biotypes at eight times the labeled field rate of all ALS-inhibiting herbicides tested. For in vivo tests of ALS activity, the SCr biotype yielded I-50 (concentration of herbicide that reduced ALS activity 50%) values 3,650, 3,290, and 13 times the S biotypes following treatment with trifloxysulfuron, foramsulfuron, and bispyribac-sodium, respectively. Similarly, I-50 values for the GAr biotype were 316, 140, and 64 times greater than the S biotypes following the same herbicide treatments. This research indicates high levels of annual bluegrass resistance to multiple ALS-inhibiting herbicides in South Carolina and Georgia. Future research should focus on the mechanisms of ALS resistance in these annual bluegrass biotypes as well as alternative options for control not targeting the ALS enzyme.									8	0	0	8	0	8			0043-1745			WOS:000321320300006

Also included were measures of anxiety, depression, self-esteem, physical well-being, school attendance, and academic performance.Results: Participants were categorized as belonging to one of four groups: cyber victims, cyberbullies, cyber bully/victims, and those not involved in cyberbullying. A similar categorization was done with traditional bullying. Those in the bully/victim groups (and particularly the cyber bully/victim group) had the most negative scores on most measures of psychological health, physical, health, and academic performance.Conclusions: There appears to be a substantial, although not perfect, overlap between involvement in traditional bullying and cyberbullying. Additionally, the physical, psychological, and academic correlates of the two types of bullying resembled one another. (C) 2013 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

Approximately 10% of protein-encoding genes on the X chromosome are implicated in intellectual disability, and the corresponding intellectual disability is termed X-linked ID (XLID). Although few mutations and a small number of families have been identified and XLID is rare, collectively the impact of XLID is significant because patients usually are unable to fully participate in society.Objective To reveal the molecular mechanisms of various intellectual disabilities and to suggest small molecules which by binding to the malfunctioning protein can reduce unwanted effects.Methods Using various in silico methods we reveal the molecular mechanism of XLID in cases involving proteins with known 3D structure. The 3D structures were used to predict the effect of disease-causing missense mutations on the folding free energy, conformational dynamics, hydrogen bond network and, if appropriate, protein-protein binding free energy.Results It is shown that the vast majority of XLID mutation sites are outside the active pocket and are accessible from the water phase, thus providing the opportunity to alter their effect by binding appropriate small molecules in the vicinity of the mutation site.Conclusions This observation is used to demonstrate, computationally and experimentally, that a particular condition, Snyder-Robinson syndrome caused by the G56S spermine synthase mutation, might be ameliorated by small molecule binding.									7	0	0	4	0	7			1067-5027			WOS:000320168600008	23408511

The identification and compensation of the circular target systematic eccentricity error caused by perspective projection is an important issue for ensuring accurate measurement. This paper introduces a novel approach for identifying and correcting the eccentricity error with the help of a concentric circles target. Compared with previous eccentricity error correction methods, our approach does not require taking care of the geometric parameters of the measurement system regarding target and camera. Therefore, the proposed approach is very flexible in practical applications, and in particular, it is also applicable in the case of only one image with a single target available. The experimental results are presented to prove the efficiency and stability of the proposed approach for eccentricity error compensation.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0957-0233	1361-6501		WOS:000320449100048

EPI affects many dog breeds, with a dramatically higher prevalence in the German shepherd dog (GSD) population. In this breed and perhaps others, EPI most often results from degeneration of the acinar cells of the pancreas, a hereditary disorder termed pancreatic acinar atrophy (PAA). Evidence of lymphocytic infiltration indicates that PAA is an autoimmune disease, but the genetic etiology remains unclear. Data from global gene expression and single nucleotide polymorphism profiles in the GSD suggest the involvement of the major histocompatibility complex [MHC; dog leukocyte antigen (DLA)]. To determine if alleles of the MHC influence development of EPI, genotyping of polymorphic class I (DLA-88) and II loci (DLA-DRB1, DLA-DQA1, and DLA-DQB1) was carried out for 70 affected and 63 control GSDs, and four-locus haplotypes were determined. One haplotype containing a novel allele of DLA-88 is very highly associated with EPI (OR > 17; P = 0.000125), while two haplotypes were found to confer protection from EPI (P = 0.00087 and 0.0115). Described herein is the genotyping of MHC class I and II loci in a GSD cohort, establishment of four-locus haplotypes, and association of alleles/haplotypes with EPI.									6	0	0	6	0	6			0093-7711			WOS:000320393400003	23604463

TEM8 is upregulated on endothelial cells lining the blood vessels within tumors, compared with normal blood vessels. A number of studies have demonstrated a pivotal role for TEM8 in developmental and tumor angiogenesis. We have also shown that targeting the anthrax receptors with a mutated form of PA inhibits angiogenesis and tumor formation in vivo. Here we describe the development and testing of a high-throughput fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay to identify molecules that strongly inhibit the interaction of PA and TEM8. The assay we describe is sensitive and robust, with a Z' value of 0.8. A preliminary screen of 2310 known bioactive library compounds identified ebselen and thimerosal as inhibitors of the TEM8-PA interaction. These molecules each contain a cysteine-reactive transition metal, and complementary studies indicate that their inhibition of interaction is due to modification of a cysteine residue in the TEM8 extracellular domain. This is the first demonstration of a high-throughput screening assay that identifies inhibitors of TEM8, with potential application for antianthrax and antiangiogenic diseases.									5	0	0	3	0	5			1087-0571			WOS:000320888100009	23479355

Musculoskeletal determinants of pelvic sucker function in hawaiian stream gobiid fishes: Interspecific comparisons and allometric scaling								JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY				274	7			733	742		10.1002/jmor.20130			JUL 2013	2013	Gobiid fishes possess a distinctive ventral sucker, formed from fusion of the pelvic fins. This sucker is used to adhere to a wide range of substrates including, in some species, the vertical cliffs of waterfalls that are climbed during upstream migrations. Previous studies of waterfall-climbing goby species have found that pressure differentials and adhesive forces generated by the sucker increase with positive allometry as fish grow in size, despite isometry or negative allometry of sucker area. To produce such scaling patterns for pressure differential and adhesive force, waterfall-climbing gobies might exhibit allometry for other muscular or skeletal components of the pelvic sucker that contribute to its adhesive function. In this study, we used anatomical dissections and modeling to evaluate the potential for allometric growth in the cross-sectional area, effective mechanical advantage (EMA), and force generating capacity of major protractor and retractor muscles of the pelvic sucker (m. protractor ischii and m. retractor ischii) that help to expand the sealed volume of the sucker to produce pressure differentials and adhesive force. We compared patterns for three Hawaiian gobiid species: a nonclimber (Stenogobius hawaiiensis), an ontogenetically limited climber (Awaous guamensis), and a proficient climber (Sicyopterus stimpsoni). Scaling patterns were relatively similar for all three species, typically exhibiting isometric or negatively allometric scaling for the muscles and lever systems examined. Although these scaling patterns do not help to explain the positive allometry of pressure differentials and adhesive force as climbing gobies grow, the best climber among the species we compared, S. stimpsoni, does exhibit the highest calculated estimates of EMA, muscular input force, and output force for pelvic sucker retraction at any body size, potentially facilitating its adhesive ability.

The purposes of this study were to establish detailed and informed input parameters for an epidemiologic simulation model of the H5N1 strain of HPAI among commercial and backyard poultry in the state of South Carolina in the United States using a highly realistic representation of this poultry population; to estimate the consequences of an outbreak of HPAI in this population with a model constructed from these parameters; and to briefly evaluate the sensitivity of model outcomes to several parameters. Parameters describing disease state durations; disease transmission via direct contact, indirect contact, and local-area spread; and disease detection, surveillance, and control were established through consultation with subject matter experts, a review of the current literature, and the use of several computational tools. The stochastic model constructed from these parameters produced simulated outbreaks ranging from 2 to 111 days in duration (median 25 days), during which 1 to 514 flocks were infected (median 28 flocks). Model results were particularly sensitive to the rate of indirect contact that occurs among flocks. The baseline model established in this study can be used in the future to evaluate various control strategies, as a tool for emergency preparedness and response planning, and to assess the costs associated with disease control and the economic consequences of a disease outbreak.

To judge the overall performance of divergence-free mixed finite elements, we investigate linear solvers for the saddle point linear systems arising in ((P-k)(d), P-k-1(disc)) Scott-Vogelius finite element implementations of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. We investigate both direct and iterative solver methods. Due to discontinuous pressure elements in the case of Scott-Vogelius (SV) elements, considerably more solver strategies seem to deliver promising results than in the case of standard mixed finite elements such as Taylor-Hood elements. For direct methods, we extend recent preliminary work using sparse banded solvers on the penalty method formulation to finer meshes and discuss extensions. For iterative methods, we test augmented Lagrangian and H-LU preconditioners with GMRES, on both full and statically condensed systems. Several numerical experiments are provided that show these classes of solvers are well suited for use with SV elements and could deliver an interesting overall performance in several applications.

However, the coy values of soil parameters are difficult to determine with confidence due to the limited availability of high-quality data and inherent spatial variability. As a result, estimated coy values of soil parameters can vary within a wide range, which can result in overdesign or underdesign. In this paper, a confidence level (CL)-based method is proposed to address the problem of geotechnical design in the face of uncertainty. Here, CL is a measure of confidence that the target reliability index will be satisfied in the face of uncertainty in the estimated coy. The proposed method is demonstrated through the design of a cantilever retaining wall in sand. To ensure the practicality of the proposed method, a simplified approach was developed, which requires little extra effort over that required for traditional reliability-based design. To develop the CL-based method further, a metric called the "true reliability index" is proposed, which is the actual reliability index in the face of the uncertainty in the estimated parameter statistics (mainly coy).

J	Bland, Erik; Dreau, Didier; Burg, Karen J. L.								Overcoming hypoxia to improve tissue-engineering approaches to regenerative medicine								JOURNAL OF TISSUE ENGINEERING AND REGENERATIVE MEDICINE				7	7			505	514		10.1002/term.540			JUL 2013	2013	The current clinical successes of tissue engineering are limited primarily to low-metabolism, acellular, pre-vascularized or thin tissues. Mass transport has been identified as the primary culprit, limiting the delivery of nutrients (such as oxygen and glucose) and removal of wastes, from tissues deep within a cellular scaffold. While strategies to develop sufficient vasculature to overcome hypoxia in vitro are promising, inconsistencies between the in vitro and the in vivo environments may still negate the effectiveness of large-volume tissue-engineered scaffolds. While a common theme in tissue engineering is to maximize oxygen supply, studies suggest that moderate oxygenation of cellular scaffolds during in vitro conditioning is preferable to high oxygen levels. Aiming for moderate oxygen values to prevent hypoxia while still promoting angiogenesis may be obtained by tailoring in vitro culture conditions to the oxygen environment the scaffold will experience upon implantation. This review discusses the causes and effects of tissue-engineering hypoxia and the optimization of oxygenation for the minimization of in vivo hypoxia.

J	Sanderson, Jimmy								From Loving the Hero to Despising the Villain: Sports Fans, Facebook, and Social Identity Threats								MASS COMMUNICATION AND SOCIETY				16	4			487	509		10.1080/15205436.2012.730650			JUL 1 2013	2013	This research explored how University of Cincinnati football fans used Facebook to manage a social identity threat arising from head football coach Brian Kelly leaving the school to become the head coach at the University of Notre Dame. A thematic analysis of 717 wall postings in the Get Out of Our City Brian Kelly Facebook group was conducted. Results revealed that fans responded to this social identity threat in the following ways: (a) rallying, (b) stigmatizing, (c) victimization, (d) intimidation, and (e) degradation. The results suggest that social media sites are prime vehicles for sports fans to collectively manage social identity crises. Social media enables fans to perpetuate messages that elevate group distinctiveness, minimize in-group issues, and derogate out-group members.									10	0	0	0	0	10			1520-5436			WOS:000320222000002		
J	Lindsay, C. M.; Dougan, William R.								Efficiency in the provision of pure public goods by private citizens								PUBLIC CHOICE				156	1-2			31	43		10.1007/s11127-012-9942-z			JUL 2013	2013	This paper raises an old question and proposes a new answer. The question is, "Must public goods be produced by governments?" The consensus answer is "Yes," on the grounds that transaction costs related to group size prevent all potential consumers of a public good from entering into voluntary arrangements to produce efficient levels of that good. Government intervention thus is required to achieve efficiency.Yet many obvious examples of public goods are not financed or even subsidized by government. Conspicuous examples of this phenomenon include the development of important innovations in technique in fields such as music (Bach and Beethoven), literature (Defoe, Dickens and Shakespeare, not excepting Homer or Adam Smith), and the visual arts (Cezanne), not to mention many crucial scientific discoveries. Indeed, the obvious public-good aspects of scientific knowledge induced many private societies to offer prizes for particular innovations. Two questions are raised by the private, voluntary provision of nonrival outputs or inputs: (1) what conditions contribute to this phenomenon, and (2) can voluntary provision come "close" to efficient provision? We suggest in this paper that, under certain conditions, the gains from many public goods whose benefits reach nationwide populations are largely realized at group sizes far smaller than even county or municipal jurisdictions.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0048-5829			WOS:000320443600003

A degenerate two-band k.p theory is utilized to calculate the variation of the electronic band structure in the semiconductor nanocomposite thin films as a function of externally applied strains. The strain-dependent electrical conductivity of the material is computed by using a two dimensional real-space Non-Equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) self-consistently coupled with the Poisson equation. In the analysis, [100] uniaxial, [100]/[001] and [100]/[010] biaxial strains are considered for the through-thickness electron transport in [100] direction. Numerical results demonstrate that the external strains have a significant influence on the electrical conductivity of the nanocomposite thin films. We show that the electrical conductivity variation can be attributed to combined effects of strain-induced splitting of the conduction band edges and change in band offset, electron quantum confinement, and size of the inclusion material in the thin films.

These computer-aided predictions involve the theoretical foundation, numerical modeling, and supporting experimental data, all of which come with their associated errors. A natural question then arises concerning the validity of computer model predictions, especially in cases where these models are executed in support of high-consequence decision making. This article lays out a methodology for quantifying the degrading effects of incompleteness and inaccuracy of the theoretical foundation, numerical modeling, and experimental data on the computer model predictions. Through the method discussed in this paper, the validity of model predictions can be judged and communicated between involved parties in a quantitative and objective manner.									11	1	0	0	0	11			0887-3801			WOS:000320102700007

Rapid Automatized Naming and Immediate Memory Functions in Chinese Children Who Read English as a Second Language								JOURNAL OF LEARNING DISABILITIES				46	4			347	362		10.1177/0022219411424209			JUL 2013	2013	This study examined reading performance of 102 Chinese Mandarin-speaking 4th graders in their second language (L2, English) as a function of performance in their first language (L1, Chinese). The results revealed that for Rapid Automatized Naming (RAN) and Rapid Alternating Stimulus (RAS) measures, the mean naming time decreased monotonically in high-achieving, average, and low-achieving readers. RAN and RAS differentiated poor readers from good and average readers but failed to differentiate between good and average readers. RAN deficits occurred in poor readers in both languages. Comparison of memory profiles revealed that patterns varied depending on the mode of stimulus presentation or response. Low-achieving readers performed poorly on a subtest involving visual components only and did relatively better on a subtest involving verbal components only. Poor readers in Chinese also encountered difficulties in learning English as a L2. RAN-character accounted for unique variance in two Chinese reading measures. RAN-letter explained unique variance in English mid-term reading grade. The unique variance captured by the Color Span Subtest 1 (visual-visual) was found in Chinese reading comprehension but not in English reading comprehension. Reading performance in L1 was predictive of reading performance in L2 and vice versa.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-2194			WOS:000319816700005	22034524

The Role of Heritage and Cultural Elements in Coastal Tourism Destination Preferences: A Choice Modeling-Based Analysis								JOURNAL OF TRAVEL RESEARCH				52	4			534	546		10.1177/0047287512475215			JUL 2013	2013	Despite the shifting demands of coastal tourists, little information exists on the consumer demand for cultural or heritage elements in coastal destinations.This study examines tourists' demand for regional character when vacationing on the South Carolina coast. Preferences for authentic trip elements such as the destination's local character and the local ownership of restaurants were measured using stated preference choice modeling. This method forces individuals to make choices between hypothetical trips based on tradeoffs of attributes such as number of activities, amount of locally owned restaurants, degree of local character, and trip cost. The results of a survey with South Carolina Coastal Tourists (N = 697) indicate significant preferences for local character and local restaurant ownership, suggesting that tourists likely have a considerable desire for regional character in their vacations. However this desire was lower than the desire for other attributes that did not involve cultural or heritage elements.									6	0	0	1	0	6			0047-2875			WOS:000319981700011		
J	Petukh, Marharyta; Stefl, Shannon; Alexov, Emil								The Role of Protonation States in Ligand-Receptor Recognition and Binding								CURRENT PHARMACEUTICAL DESIGN				19	23			4182	4190					JUL 2013	2013	In this review we discuss the role of protonation states in receptor-ligand interactions, providing experimental evidences and computational predictions that complex formation may involve titratable groups with unusual pKa's and that protonation states frequently change from unbound to bound states. These protonation changes result in proton uptake/release, which in turn causes the pH-dependence of the binding. Indeed, experimental data strongly suggest that almost any binding is pH-dependent and to be correctly modeled, the protonation states must be properly assigned prior to and after the binding. One may accurately predict the protonation states when provided with the structures of the unbound proteins and their complex; however, the modeling becomes much more complicated if the bound state has to be predicted in a docking protocol or if the structures of either bound or unbound receptor-ligand are not available. The major challenges that arise in these situations are the coupling between binding and protonation states, and the conformational changes induced by the binding and ionization states of titratable groups. In addition, any assessment of the protonation state, either before or after binding, must refer to the pH of binding, which is frequently unknown. Thus, even if the pKa's of ionizable groups can be correctly assigned for both unbound and bound state, without knowing the experimental pH one cannot assign the corresponding protonation states, and consequently one cannot calculate the resulting proton uptake/release. It is pointed out, that while experimental pH may not be the physiological pH and binding may involve proton uptake/release, there is a tendency that the native receptor-ligand complexes have evolved toward specific either subcellular or tissue characteristic pH at which the proton uptake/release is either minimal or absent.									12	0	0	7	0	12			1381-6128			WOS:000319266600004	23170880

These multiple energy sources make prediction of PHEV energy consumption challenging and also complicate evaluation of their environmental impacts. This paper introduces a novel PHEV energy consumption modeling approach and compares it to a second approach from the literature, each using actual trip patterns from the 2009 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS). The first approach applies distance-dependent fuel efficiency and on-road electricity consumption rates based on naturalistic or real world, driving information to determine gasoline and electricity consumption. The second uses consumption rates derived in accordance with government certification testing. Both approaches are applied in the context of a location-specific case study that focuses on the state of Michigan. The two PHEV models show agreement in electricity demand due to vehicle charging, gasoline consumption, and life cycle environmental impacts for this case study. The naturalistic drive cycle approach is explored as a means of extending location-specific driving data to supplement existing PHEV impact assessments methods. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The Acellular Myocardial Flap: A Novel Extracellular Matrix Scaffold Enriched with Patent Microvascular Networks and Biocompatible Cell Niches								TISSUE ENGINEERING PART C-METHODS				19	7			518	530		10.1089/ten.tec.2012.0536			JUL 2013	2013	There is a great need for acellular, fully vascularized, and biocompatible myocardial scaffolds that provide agreeable biological, nutritional, and biomechanical niches for reseeded cells for in vitro and in vivo applications. We generated myocardial flap scaffolds comprising porcine left-anterior ventricular myocardium and its associated coronary arteries and veins and investigated the combinatorial effects of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) perfusion on both the myocardial extracellular matrix (ECM) and the vascular ECM. Results showed that all scaffolds displayed a fully intact and patent vasculature, with arterial burst pressures indistinguishable from native coronary arteries and perfusion to the level of capillaries. Scaffolds were free of cellular proteins and retained collagen and elastin ECM components, exhibited excellent mechanical properties, and were cytocompatible toward relevant seeded cells. SDS perfusion preserved collagen IV, laminin, and fibronectin well, but only reduced DNA content by 33%; however, this was further improved by post-SDS nuclease treatments. By comparison, NaOH was very effective in removing cells and eliminated more than 95% of tissue DNA, but also significantly reduced levels of laminin and fibronectin. Such constructs can be readily trimmed to match the size of the infarct and might be able to functionally integrate within host myocardium and be nourished by direct anastomotic connection with the host's own vasculature; they might also be useful as physiologically accurate models for in vitro studies of cardiac physiology and pathology.									8	0	0	8	0	9			1937-3384	1937-3392		WOS:000319404500004	23151037	
J	Yu, Lu; Schwier, Jason M.; Craven, Ryan M.; Brooks, Richard R.; Griffin, Christopher								Inferring Statistically Significant Hidden Markov Models								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING				25	7			1548	1558		10.1109/TKDE.2012.93			JUL 2013	2013	Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are used to analyze real-world problems. We consider an approach that constructs minimum entropy HMMs directly from a sequence of observations. If an insufficient amount of observation data is used to generate the HMM, the model will not represent the underlying process. Current methods assume that observations completely represent the underlying process. It is often the case that the training data size is not large enough to adequately capture all statistical dependencies in the system. It is, therefore, important to know the statistical significance level for that the constructed model representing the underlying process, not only the training set. In this paper, we present a method to determine if the observation data and constructed model fully express the underlying process with a given level of statistical significance. We use the statistics of the process to calculate an upper bound on the number of samples required to guarantee that the model has a given level significance. We provide theoretical and experimental results that confirm the utility of this approach. The experiment is conducted on a real private Tor network.									4	1	0	0	0	5			1041-4347			WOS:000319461800009

Negative emotions are broken into two distinct components, those inwardly felt versus those outwardly visible. Consistent with Appraisal Theory, results provide empirical support for positive relationships between felt emotion and displayed emotion and displayed emotion on third party action against a service firm. Hofstede's model suggests that cultural values (individualism, uncertainty avoidance, and power distance) influence emotions internally felt relative to emotions externally displayed as well as intentions to voice a complaint to a third party. Empirical support was found for two of the six cultural-based moderating hypotheses. The results of the data collection effort were less conclusive than theory would suggest. This leads one to question the actual moderating effects of culture in the field of critical incidents. Theoretical and managerial implications are drawn from these findings. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

The use of elaborate closed-loop lumped parameter network (LPN) models of the heart and the circulatory system as boundary conditions for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations can provide valuable global dynamic information, particularly for patient specific simulations. In this paper, the necessary formulation for coupling an arbitrary LPN to a finite element Navier-Stokes solver is presented. A circuit analogy closed-loop LPN is solved numerically, and pressure and flow information is iteratively passed between the 0D and 3D domains at interface boundaries, resulting in a time-implicit scheme. For Neumann boundaries, an implicit method, regardless of the LPN, is presented to achieve the desired stability and convergence properties. Numerical procedures for passing flow and pressure information between the 0D and 3D domains are described, and implicit, semi-implicit, and explicit quasi-Newton formulations are compared. The issue of divergence in the presence of back-flow is addressed via a stabilized boundary formulation. The requirements for coupling Dirichlet boundary conditions are also discussed and this approach is compared in detail to that of the Neumann coupled boundaries. Having the option to select between Dirichlet and Neumann coupled boundary conditions increases the flexibility of current framework by allowing a wide range of components to be used at the 3D-0D interface.

All hydrolysates were assayed by determination of reducing power (RP) ability. Three kinds of hydrolysates were prepared under optimal enzymatic parameters that were obtained from the preliminary one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) and response surface methodology (RSM) experiments. The results showed that the Alcalase hydrolysates exerted the best RP ability. Thereafter, the Alcalase hydrolysates were sequentially fractionated by ultra filtration membranes in cut-off molecular weight (MW) of 30, 10, and 1 kDa, and tested their antioxidant activities in terms of RP ability, DPPH radical scavenging ability, ABTS radical scavenging ability, and FRAP assay. Effects of high intensity pulsed electric field treatment were further investigated on antioxidant peptides to improve their activities. The results showed that Alcalase hydrolysates possessed the strongest antioxidant ability compared with the other two hydrolysates, particularly for the Fraction-3 with MW <1 kDa. After PEF treatment, this fraction showed a significant improvement of RP ability within 5 h (P < 0.05). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper shows that, despite its embedded empiricism, the Hassan and Wolff method can identify with reasonable accuracy not only the most critical slip surface, but also representative slip surface for system reliability analysis. In the Hassan and Wolff method, the assumed distribution of FOS has important effect on the calculated failure probability and it is not appropriate to always assume FOS is lognormally distributed. Whether the system effect in a slope reliability analysis is obvious can be judged easily by comparing the values of reliability index of different representative slip surfaces. Combined with the response surface method, the Hassan and Wolff method can be extended into a practical tool for system reliability analysis utilizing existing deterministic slope stability analysis programs. A simple equation is provided to estimate the bounds of system failure probability based on the most critical slip surface. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Optimal targeting of seasonal influenza vaccination toward younger ages is robust to parameter uncertainty								VACCINE				31	30			3079	3089		10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.04.052			JUN 26 2013	2013	Identification of the optimal vaccine allocation for the control of influenza requires consideration of uncertainty arising from numerous unpredictable factors, including viral evolution and diversity within the human population's immunity as well as variation in vaccine efficacy. The best policy must account for diverse potential outcomes based on these uncertainties. Here we used a mathematical model parametrized with survey-based contact data, demographic, and epidemiological data from seasonal influenza in the United States to determine the optimal vaccine allocation for five outcome measures: infections, hospitalizations, deaths, years of life loss, and contingent valuation. We incorporated uncertainty of epidemiological parameters and derive probability distributions of optimal age- and risk-specific allocation of vaccine. Our analysis demonstrated that previous recommendations of targeting schoolchildren (ages 5-17 years) and young adults (18-44 years) are generally robust in the face of uncertainty. However, when the outcome measure is to minimize deaths, years of life loss, or contingent valuation, uncertainty analysis identified scenarios under which it is optimal to target people at high risk for complications, even when vaccine are in abundance.

The PC may alter the nanomaterial's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, thereby influencing toxicity. Using a label-free mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach, the composition of the PC is examined for a set of nanotubes (NTs) including unmodified and carboxylated single- (SWCNT) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-coated MWCNT (MWCNT-PVP), and nanoclay. NTs are incubated for 1 h in simulated cell culture conditions, then washed, resuspended in PBS, and assessed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for their associated PC. To determine those attributes that influence PC formation, the NTs are extensively characterized. NTs had negative zeta potentials in water (SWCNT-COOH < MWCNT-COOH < unmodified NTs) while carboxylation increases their hydrodynamic sizes. All NTs are also found to associate a common subset of proteins including albumin, titin, and apolipoproteins. SWCNT-COOH and MWCNT-COOH are found to bind the greatest number of proteins (181 and 133 respectively) compared to unmodified NTs (<100), suggesting covalent binding to protein amines. Modified NTs bind a number of unique proteins compared to unmodified NTs, implying hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions are involved in PC formation. PVP-coating of MWCNT did not influence PC composition, further reinforcing the possibility of hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions. No relationships are found between PC composition and corresponding isoelectric point, hydropathy, or aliphatic index, implying minimal roles of hydrophobic interaction and pi-stacking.									39	2	0	20	0	40			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000320401800019	23322550

We analyze the thermodynamic properties exhibiting the distinct nature of the topological phase transitions linked with the Majorana fermions (2D Fermi gas) and Weyl fermions (3D Fermi gas) which can be observed experimentally, including pressure, chemical potential, isothermal compressibility, entropy, and specific heat, as a function of the interaction and the Zeeman field at both zero and finite temperatures. We conclude that among the various thermodynamic quantities, the isothermal compressibility and the chemical potential as functions of the artificial Zeeman field have the strongest signatures of the topological transitions in both two and three dimensions.									12	1	0	0	0	12			1050-2947			WOS:000320757800006

Thus, their mechanical properties are of central importance to understanding hemostasis and thrombotic disease. Recent studies have revealed that fibrin fibers are elastomeric despite their high degree of molecular ordering. These results have inspired a variety of molecular models for fibrin's elasticity, ranging from reversible protein unfolding to rubber-like elasticity. An important property that has not been explored is the timescale of elastic recoil, a parameter that is critical for fibrin's mechanical function and places a temporal constraint on molecular models of fiber elasticity. Using high-frame-rate imaging and atomic force microscopy-based nanomanipulation, we measured the recoil dynamics of individual fibrin fibers and found that the recoil was orders of magnitude faster than anticipated from models involving protein refolding. We also performed steered discrete molecular-dynamics simulations to investigate the molecular origins of the observed recoil. Our results point to the unstructured alpha C regions of the otherwise structured fibrin molecule as being responsible for the elastic recoil of the fibers.									6	0	0	5	0	6			0006-3495			WOS:000320757100012	23790375

Investigation of concurrent energy harvesting from ambient vibrations and wind using a single piezoelectric generator								APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS				102	24					243904	10.1063/1.4811408			JUN 17 2013	2013	In this letter, a single vibratory energy harvester integrated with an airfoil is proposed to concurrently harness energy from ambient vibrations and wind. In terms of its transduction capabilities and power density, the integrated device is shown to have a superior performance under the combined loading when compared to utilizing two separate devices to harvest energy independently from the two available energy sources. Even below its flutter speed, the proposed device was able to provide 2.5 times the power obtained using two separate harvesters.

However, the extent to which cancer mutations might affect biomolecular interactions remains unclear. Here, we map glioblastoma missense mutations on the human protein interactome, model the structures of affected protein complexes and decipher the effect of mutations on protein-protein, protein-nucleic acid and protein-ion binding interfaces. Although some missense mutations over-stabilize protein complexes, we found that the overall effect of mutations is destabilizing, mostly affecting the electrostatic component of binding energy. We also showed that mutations on interfaces resulted in more drastic changes of amino acid physico-chemical properties than mutations occurring outside the interfaces. Analysis of glioblastoma mutations on interfaces allowed us to stratify cancer-related interactions, identify potential driver genes, and propose two dozen additional cancer biomarkers, including those specific to functions of the nervous system. Such an analysis also offered insight into the molecular mechanism of the phenotypic outcomes of mutations, including effects on complex stability, activity, binding and turnover rate. As a result of mutated protein and gene network analysis, we observed that interactions of proteins with mutations mapped on interfaces had higher bottleneck properties compared to interactions with mutations elsewhere on the protein or unaffected interactions. Such observations suggest that genes with mutations directly affecting protein binding properties are preferably located in central network positions and may influence critical nodes and edges in signal transduction networks.									26	0	0	22	0	26			1932-6203			WOS:000320363300071	23799087	
J	Stanescu, T. D.; Tewari, S.								Majorana fermions in semiconductor nanowires: fundamentals, modeling, and experiment								JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER				25	23					233201	10.1088/0953-8984/25/23/233201			JUN 12 2013	2013	After a recent series of rapid and exciting developments, the long search for the Majorana fermion-the elusive quantum entity at the border between particles and antiparticles-has produced the first positive experimental results, but is not over yet. Originally proposed by E Majorana in the context of particle physics, Majorana fermions have a condensed matter analogue in the zero-energy bound states emerging in topological superconductors. A promising route to engineering topological superconductors capable of hosting Majorana zero modes consists of proximity coupling semiconductor thin films or nanowires with strong spin-orbit interaction to conventional s-wave superconductors in the presence of an external Zeeman field. The Majorana zero mode is predicted to emerge above a certain critical Zeeman field as a zero-energy state localized near the order parameter defects, namely, vortices for thin films and wire ends for the nanowire. These Majorana bound states are expected to manifest non-Abelian quantum statistics, which makes them ideal building blocks for fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. This review provides an update on the current status of the search for Majorana fermions in semiconductor nanowires by focusing on the recent developments, in particular the period following the first reports of experimental signatures consistent with the realization of Majorana bound states in semiconductor nanowire-superconductor hybrid structures. We start with a discussion of the fundamental aspects of the subject, followed by considerations on the realistic modeling, which is a critical bridge between theoretical predictions based on idealized conditions and the real world, as probed experimentally. The last part is dedicated to a few intriguing issues that were brought to the fore by the recent encouraging experimental advances.									151	4	1	7	0	152			0953-8984			WOS:000319673700003	23665894

We demonstrate that replacing the diamagnetic aqueous medium with a dilute ferrofluid can significantly increase the throughput of magnetic and diamagnetic particle separation. This enhancement is attributed to the simultaneous positive and negative magnetophoresis of magnetic and diamagnetic particles, respectively, in a ferrofluid. The particle transport behaviors in both ferrofluid- and water-based separations are predicted using an analytical model.

Even though the state breaks translational symmetry by a lattice spacing and is described by a particle-hole singlet order parameter at the wave vector q = Q = (pi, pi), remarkably, we find that the amplitude mode spectrum can have peaks at both q = (0,0) and q = Q = (pi, pi); we shall set lattice spacing to unity. In general, the spectrum is nonuniversal and, depending on the microscopic parameters, can have one or two peaks in the Brillouin zone, signifying the existence of two kinds of magnetic excitations. Our theory sheds important light on how multiple inelastic neutron peaks at different wave vectors can, in principle, arise even with an order parameter that condenses at Q = (pi, pi).									3	0	0	0	0	3			1098-0121			WOS:000320164500010

Ficklin, Stephen/0000-0001-9138-6292			Maximizing capture of gene co-expression relationships through pre-clustering of input expression samples: an Arabidopsis case study								BMC SYSTEMS BIOLOGY				7						44	10.1186/1752-0509-7-44			JUN 5 2013	2013	Background: In genomics, highly relevant gene interaction (co-expression) networks have been constructed by finding significant pair-wise correlations between genes in expression datasets. These networks are then mined to elucidate biological function at the polygenic level. In some cases networks may be constructed from input samples that measure gene expression under a variety of different conditions, such as for different genotypes, environments, disease states and tissues. When large sets of samples are obtained from public repositories it is often unmanageable to associate samples into condition-specific groups, and combining samples from various conditions has a negative effect on network size. A fixed significance threshold is often applied also limiting the size of the final network. Therefore, we propose pre-clustering of input expression samples to approximate condition-specific grouping of samples and individual network construction of each group as a means for dynamic significance thresholding. The net effect is increase sensitivity thus maximizing the total co-expression relationships in the final co-expression network compendium.Results: A total of 86 Arabidopsis thaliana co-expression networks were constructed after k-means partitioning of 7,105 publicly available ATH1 Affymetrix microarray samples. We term each pre-sorted network a Gene Interaction Layer (GIL). Random Matrix Theory (RMT), an un-supervised thresholding method, was used to threshold each of the 86 networks independently, effectively providing a dynamic (non-global) threshold for the network. The overall gene count across all GILs reached 19,588 genes (94.7% measured gene coverage) and 558,022 unique co-expression relationships. In comparison, network construction without pre-sorting of input samples yielded only 3,297 genes (15.9%) and 129,134 relationships. in the global network.Conclusions: Here we show that pre-clustering of microarray samples helps approximate condition-specific networks and allows for dynamic thresholding using un-supervised methods. Because RMT ensures only highly significant interactions are kept, the GIL compendium consists of 558,022 unique high quality A. thaliana co-expression relationships across almost all of the measurable genes on the ATH1 array. For A. thaliana, these networks represent the largest compendium to date of significant gene co-expression relationships, and are a means to explore complex pathway, polygenic, and pleiotropic relationships for this focal model plant. The networks can be explored at sysbio.genome.clemson.edu. Finally, this method is applicable to any large expression profile collection for any organism and is best suited where a knowledge-independent network construction method is desired.									7	0	0	6	0	7			1752-0509			WOS:000320053900001	23738693	
J	Cook, George W.; Konkel, Miriam K.; Walker, Jerilyn A.; Bourgeois, Matthew G.; Fullerton, Mitchell L.; Fussell, John T.; Herbold, Heath D.; Batzer, Mark A.								A Comparison of 100 Human Genes Using an Alu Element-Based Instability Model								PLOS ONE				8	6					e65188	10.1371/journal.pone.0065188			JUN 3 2013	2013	The human retrotransposon with the highest copy number is the Alu element. The human genome contains over one million Alu elements that collectively account for over ten percent of our DNA. Full-length Alu elements are randomly distributed throughout the genome in both forward and reverse orientations. However, full-length widely spaced Alu pairs having two Alus in the same (direct) orientation are statistically more prevalent than Alu pairs having two Alus in the opposite (inverted) orientation. The cause of this phenomenon is unknown. It has been hypothesized that this imbalance is the consequence of anomalous inverted Alu pair interactions. One proposed mechanism suggests that inverted Alu pairs can ectopically interact, exposing both ends of each Alu element making up the pair to a potential double-strand break, or "hit". This hypothesized "two-hit" (two double-strand breaks) potential per Alu element was used to develop a model for comparing the relative instabilities of human genes. The model incorporates both 1) the two-hit double-strand break potential of Alu elements and 2) the probability of exon-damaging deletions extending from these double-strand breaks. This model was used to compare the relative instabilities of 50 deletion-prone cancer genes and 50 randomly selected genes from the human genome. The output of the Alu element-based genomic instability model developed here is shown to coincide with the observed instability of deletion-prone cancer genes. The 50 cancer genes are collectively estimated to be 58% more unstable than the randomly chosen genes using this model. Seven of the deletion-prone cancer genes, ATM, BRCA1, FANCA, FANCD2, MSH2, NCOR1 and PBRM1, were among the most unstable 10% of the 100 genes analyzed. This algorithm may lay the foundation for comparing genetic risks posed by structural variations that are unique to specific individuals, families and people groups.									3	1	0	3	0	4			1932-6203			WOS:000319872300057	23755193

Distances for the onset of classically allowed above-surface electron capture are obtained as a function of HCI charge state, film thickness, film permittivity, and film-metal electron binding energies. The model describes the crossover between the previously existing COB model for bulk metals and bulk dielectrics as the thickness of a dielectric film on a metal substrate increases through three distinct regimes. For ultrathin films with low permittivity and positive electron affinity, over-the-barrier charge transfer initiates from the metal electrons behind the film and critical distances are greater than those from bare metal targets. This result is consistent and compared with the recent observation of potential emission enhancement above thin C-60 films on Au(111) with increasing film thickness [Bodewits, Hoekstra, Kowarik, Dobes, and Aumayr, Phys. Rev. A 84, 042901 (2011)].									1	0	0	0	0	1			1050-2947			WOS:000319909500004

Shelf Life Extension of Shrimp (White) Using Modified Atmosphere Packaging								POLISH JOURNAL OF FOOD AND NUTRITION SCIENCES				63	2			87	94		10.2478/v10222-012-0071-7			JUN 2013	2013	Wild caught shrimp can have a shortened shelf life compared to farm raised shrimp due to handling and on-ship limitations. The loss of freshness in shrimp is partly due to autolytic reactions caused by endogenous enzymes such as polyphenol oxidase. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of sulfites combined with modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) on the shelf life of non-frozen shrimp. Fresh South Atlantic white shrimp were subjected to one of four treatments, no bisulfite rinse-air packaged, 1.25% bisulfite rinse-air packaged, 1.25% bisulfite rinse-MAP (60% CO2, 18% O-2 22% N-2) and 1.25% bisulfite rinse-MAP (36% CO2, 64%N-2). The quality and freshness of shrimp was measured by determining total aerobic bacterial populations, package gas headspace analysis, shrimp volatiles (GC-MS), meat pH, nucleotide degradation, and visual analysis. Fresh non-frozen shrimp treated with a combination of sulfites and MAP maintained the shelf life of fresh shrimp up to 10 days while shrimp in non-MAP without sulfite and non-MAP with sulfite developed black spots within 2 and 6 days, respectively. Both MAP treatments slowed bacterial growth while the MAP with high CO2 and with O-2 was more effective in preventing off odors and nucleotide degeneration.									3	0	0	1	0	3			1230-0322	2083-6007		WOS:000319310500003		
J	Barnett, Andy; Yandle, Bruce; Naufal, George								Regulation, trust, and cronyism in Middle Eastern societies: The simple economics of "wasta"								JOURNAL OF SOCIO-ECONOMICS				44				41	46		10.1016/j.socec.2013.02.004			JUN 2013	2013	Despite being a fixture of everyday life in the Arab world, wasta, which may be thought of as special influence by members of the same group or tribe, has received little attention from social scientists. Our casual empiricism suggests that wasta is an important determinant of how economic activities are organized and resources are allocated in Middle Eastern societies, yet economists, even those who specialize in work related to the Middle East, have not addressed the issue of wasta. With this paper we provide a modest beginning to filling that void. Specifically, we use the history of wasta, Hayek's concept of extended order and Coase's work on the nature of the firm to draw inferences regarding the existence of wasta and its persistence in Arab societies.

A natural immune modulator attenuates stress hormone and catecholamine concentrations in polymicrobial peritonitis								JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND ACUTE CARE SURGERY				74	6			1411	1418		10.1097/TA.0b013e31829215b1			JUN 2013	2013	BACKGROUND: Activated hexose correlated compound (AHCC), derived from shiitake mushrooms, increases resistance to infection in immunocompromised hosts with positive effects on dendritic cells, natural killer cell function and interleukin 12 production. It may also be attenuating the systemic inflammatory response by regulating the secretion of cortisol and norepinephrine (NE).METHODS: Female Swiss-Weber mice were pretreated with AHCC (Amino Up Chemical Co., Sapporo, Japan) or water by gavage for 10 days before undergoing cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Peritoneal exudate cells and blood samples were harvested at 4 hours and 24 hours following CLP. Plasma and peritoneal concentrations of cortisol and NE were obtained using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Peritoneal bacteria were quantified by colony counts after 4 hours and 24 hours. Significance was denoted by a p < 0.05.RESULTS: Plasma and peritoneal cortisol concentrations were increased 4 hours after CLP compared with normal controls, with no difference between the pretreated groups. Concentrations of cortisol decreased from 4 hours to 24 hours after CLP with AHCC (plasma, p = 0.009; peritoneal, p < 0.001), and peritoneal cortisol at 24 hours was lower with AHCC as compared with water (p = 0.028). There was no change in plasma or peritoneal NE concentrations at 4 hours. At 24 hours, higher concentrations of NE were detected in both plasma and peritoneal fluid, with lower plasma concentrations in those gavaged with AHCC (p = 0.015). There was no significant difference in peritoneal bacteria counts.CONCLUSION: Enhanced immune function observed with AHCC could be caused by attenuated concentrations of stress hormones and catecholamines.

J	Kotanen, Christian N.; Guiseppi-Elie, Anthony								Monitoring systems and quantitative measurement of biomolecules for the management of Trauma								BIOMEDICAL MICRODEVICES				15	3			561	577		10.1007/s10544-013-9756-x			JUN 2013	2013	Continued high morbidity and complications due to trauma related hemorrhage underscores the fact that our understanding of the detailed molecular events of trauma are inadequate to bring life-saving changes to practice. The current state of efficacy and advances in biomedical microdevice technology for trauma diagnostics concerning hemorrhage and hemorrhagic shock was considered with respect to vital signs and metabolic biomarkers. Tachycardia and hypotension are markers of hemorrhagic shock in decompensated trauma patients. Base deficit has been predicative of injury severity at hospital admission. Tissue oxygen saturation has been predicative of onset of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Blood potassium levels increase with onset of hemorrhagic shock. Lactate is a surrogate for tissue hypoxia and its clearance predicts mortality. Triage glucose measurements have been shown to be specific in predicting major injuries. No vital sign has yet to be proven effective as an independent predictor of trauma severity. Point of care (POC) devices allow for rapid results, easy sample preparation and processing, small sample volumes, small footprint, multifunctional analysis, and low cost. Advances in the field of in-vivo biosensors has provided a much needed platform by which trauma related metabolites can be monitored easily, rapidly and continuously. Multi-analyte monitoring biosensors have the potential to explore areas still undiscovered in the realm of trauma physiology.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1387-2176	1572-8781		WOS:000318812900018	23494594

A microbiological survey was conducted on 103 organic fertilizers from across the United States. Moisture content ranged from approximately 1% to 86.4%, and the average pH was 7.77. The total aerobic mesophiles ranged from approximately 3 to 9 log colony-forming units (CFU)/g. Enterobacteriaceae populations were in the range of <1 to approximately 7 log CFU/g, while coliform levels varied from <1 to approximately 6 log CFU/g. Thirty samples (29%) were positive for E. coli, with levels reaching approximately 6 log CFU/g. There were no confirmed positives for E. coli O157: H7, Salmonella, or Listeria monocytogenes. The majority of E. coli isolates (n = 73), confirmed by glutamate decarboxylase (gad) PCR, were from group B1 (48%) and group A (32%). Resistance to 16 antibiotics was examined for 73 E. coli isolates, with 11 isolates having resistance to at least one antibiotic, 5 isolates to >= 2 antibiotics, and 2 isolates to >= 10 antibiotics. In the presence of high levels of background aerobic mesophiles, Salmonella and E. coli O157: H7 grew approximately 1 log CFU/g within 1 day of incubation in plant-based compost and fish emulsion-based compost, respectively. With low levels of background aerobic mesophiles, Salmonella grew approximately 2.6, 3.0, 3.0, and 3.2 log CFU/g in blood, bone, and feather meals and the mixed-source fertilizer, respectively, whereas E. coli O157: H7 grew approximately 4.6, 4.0, 4.0, and 4.8 log CFU/g, respectively. Our results revealed that the microbiological quality of organic fertilizers varies greatly, with some fertilizers containing antibiotic resistant E. coli and a few supporting the growth of foodborne pathogens after reintroduction into the fertilizer.									3	1	0	1	0	4			1535-3141			WOS:000320380100006	23614803

Microbial transformation of dissolved organic matter from different sources and its influence on disinfection byproduct formation potentials								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH				20	6			4176	4187		10.1007/s11356-012-1384-0			JUN 2013	2013	Biodegradation-induced changes in the characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and the subsequent effects on disinfection byproduct formation potentials (DBPFPs) were investigated using six different sources of DOM (algae, leaf litter, reed, compost, paddy water, and treated municipal sewage effluent). Microbial incubation of the DOM samples increased the specific ultraviolet absorbance and humic-like fluorescence but decreased the protein/tannin-like fluorescence and relative distribution of smaller-sized DOM components. Comparison of the original versus biodegraded DOM samples using resin fractionation and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry revealed that the biodegradation-induced changes were highly dependent on DOM sources and exhibited no consistent trends among the different sources. Changes in DBPFPs also differed with DOM source. Vascular plant-derived DOM (leaf litter and reed) demonstrated an enhancement in specific DBPFP after biodegradation, whereas little change or even a slight decrease was observed for the other DOM sources. Correlations that were significant between specific DBPFPs and the aromatic content or humic-like fluorescence for the original DOM samples were no longer significant after microbial degradation. The relative abundance of hydrophobic to hydrophilic structures in DOM is suggested to be a general indicator for the formation potential of trihalomethanes irrespective of DOM source and the state of biodegradation.									4	2	0	3	0	6			0944-1344			WOS:000318779200065	23247528

Incidence and Pathogenicity of Plant-Parasitic Nematodes Associated with Blueberry (Vaccinium spp.) Replant Disease in Georgia and North Carolina								JOURNAL OF NEMATOLOGY				45	2			92	98					JUN 2013	2013	Blueberry replant disease (BRD) is an emerging threat to continued blueberry (Vaccinium spp.) production in Georgia and North Carolina. Since high populations of ring nematode Mesocriconema ornatum were found to be associated with commercially grown blueberries in Georgia, we hypothesized that M. ornatum may be responsible for predisposing blueberry to BRD. We therefore tested the pathogenicity of M. ornatum on 10-wk-old Rabbiteye blueberries (Vaccinium virgatum) by inoculating with initial populations (Pi) of 0 (water control), 10, 100, 1,000. and 10,000 mixed stages of M. ornatum/pot under both greenhouse (25 +/- 2 degrees C) and field microplot conditions. Nematode soil population densities and reproduction rates were assessed 75, 150, 225, and 255, and 75, 150, 225, and 375 d after inoculation (DAI) in both the greenhouse and field experiments, respectively. Plant growth parameters were recorded in the greenhouse and field microplot experiments at 255 and 375 DAI, respectively. The highest M. ornatum population density occurred with the highest Pi level, at 75 and 150 DAI under both greenhouse (P < 0.01) and field (P < 0.01) conditions. However, M. ornatum rate of reproduction increased significantly in pots receiving the lowest Pi level of 10 nematodes/plant compared with the pots receiving Pi levels of 100, 1,000, and 10,000 nematodes 75 DAI. Plant-parasitic nematode populations were determined in commercial blueberry replant sites in Georgia and North Carolina during the 2010 growing season. Mesocriconema ornatum and Dolichodorus spp. were the predominant plant-parasitic nematodes in Georgia and North Carolina, respectively, with M. ornatum occurring in nearly half the blueberry fields sampled in Georgia. Other nematode genera detected in both states included Tylenchorhynchus spp., Hoplolaimus spp., Hemicycliophora spp., and Xiphinema spp. Paratrichodorus spp. was also found only in Georgia. In Georgia, our results indicate that blueberry is a host for M. ornatum and its relationship to BRD warrants further investigation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-300X			WOS:000326897300002	23833323	
J	Wu, Yongren; Cisewski, Sarah; Sachs, Barton L.; Yao, Hai								Effect of Cartilage Endplate on Cell Based Disc Regeneration: A Finite Element Analysis								MOLECULAR & CELLULAR BIOMECHANICS				10	2			159	182					JUN 2013	2013	This study examines the effects of cartilage endplate (CEP) calcification and the injection of intervertebral disc (IVD) cells on the nutrition distributions inside the human IVD under physiological loading conditions using multiphasic finite element modeling. The human disc was modeled as an inhomogeneous mixture consisting of a charged elastic solid, water, ions (Na+ and Cl-), and nutrient solute (oxygen, glucose and lactate) phases. The effect of the endplate calcification was simulated by a reduction of the tissue porosity (i.e., water volume faction) from 0.60 to 0.48. The effect of cell injection was simulated by increasing the cell density in the nucleus pulposus (NP) region by 50%, 100%, and 150%. Strain-dependent transport properties (e.g., hydraulic permeability and solute diffusivities) were considered to couple the solute transport and the mechanical loading. The simulation results showed that nutrient solute distribution inside the disc is maintained at a stable state during the day and night. The physiological diurnal cyclic loading does not change the nutrient environment in the human IVD. The cartilage endplate plays a significant role in the nutrient supply to human IVD. Calcification of the cartilage endplate significantly reduces the nutrient levels in human IVD. Therefore, in cell based therapy for IVD regeneration, the increased nutrient demand as a result of cell injection needs to be addressed. Excessive numbers of injected cells may cause further deterioration of the nutrient environment in the degenerated disc. This study is important for understanding the pathology of IVD degeneration and providing new insights into cell based therapies for low back pain.									2	7	0	1	1	10			1556-5297	1556-5300		WOS:000323091500004	24015481

Methods: In Experiment 1, 64 volunteers (50% women, mean age = 23.5 years) were evaluated to determine the degree they realized speed changes in nauseogenic rotation. For Experiment 2, 32 volunteers (50% women, mean age = 26.0 years) were exposed to fast rotation (15 rounds per minute, or rpm) on Day 1. On Day 2, they either received a drink with a presumed effective antiemetic (actually placebo) or were told they belonged to the control group. Rotation was surreptitiously reduced (to 10 rpm). On Day 3, they were tested with the initial rotation speed. Outcome variables in both experiments were symptom ratings; additionally in Experiment 2, the number of nauseogenic head movements, tolerated rotation time, and electrogastrogram were analyzed for changes between Days 1 and 2 (expectancy plus speed reduction) and Days 1 and 3 (expectancy plus conditioning). Results: In Experiment 1, a dose-response function was established for different rotation speeds, with the smallest perceived difference between 10 and 15 rpm. In Experiment 2, placebo application induced better maximal symptom rating, head movement, and rotation time at Day 2 (F = 3.097, p = .043) and Day 3 (F = 3.401, p = .031). Electrogastrogram was unaffected. Conclusions: Verbal suggestions combined with a conditioning procedure are effective in reducing symptoms of motion sickness.									16	0	0	11	0	16			0033-3174	1534-7796		WOS:000330468200009	23697466	
J	Boylan, Gregory L.; Cho, Byung Rae								Studies on the Effects of Estimator Selection in Robust Parameter Design under Asymmetric Conditions								QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL				29	4			571	582		10.1002/qre.1406			JUN 2013	2013	The primary goal of robust parameter design (RPD) is to determine the optimum operating conditions that achieve process performance targets while minimizing variability in the results. To achieve this goal, typical approaches to RPD problems use ordinary least squares methods to obtain response functions for the mean and variance by assuming that the experimental data follow a normal distribution and are relatively free of contaminants or outliers. Consequently, the most common estimators used in the initial tier of estimation are the sample mean and sample variance, as they are very good estimators when these assumptions hold. However, it is often the case that such assumed conditions do not exist in practice; notably, that inherent asymmetry pervades system outputs. If unaccounted for, such conditions can affect results tremendously by causing the quality of the estimates obtained using the sample mean and standard deviation to deteriorate. Focusing on asymmetric conditions, this paper examines several highly efficient estimators as alternatives to the sample mean and standard deviation. We then incorporate these estimators into RPD modeling and optimization approaches to ascertain which estimators tend to yield better solutions when skewness exists. Monte Carlo simulation and numerical studies are used to substantiate and compare the performance of the proposed methods with the traditional approach.

J	Grover, Varun; Kohli, Rajiv								REVEALING YOUR HAND: CAVEATS IN IMPLEMENTING DIGITAL BUSINESS STRATEGY								MIS QUARTERLY				37	2			655	662					JUN 2013	2013	Digital business strategies (DBS) offer significant opportunities for firms to enhance competitiveness. Unlike the large proprietary systems of the 1980s, today's "micro-applications" allow firms to create and reconfigure digital capabilities to appropriate short-term competitive advantage. In the quest to provide value to customers through digitization, such applications can be efficiently deployed. However, we propose that in the long-term not all digitization is desirable. Indiscriminate digital initiatives through the use of micro-applications by a firm could "reveal its hand" to competitors and erode competitiveness. We propose that a firm's DBS must balance its system-software, process, and information-visibility with the ability to appropriate value from such systems. Through a visibility-value framework, and examples drawn from practice, this article illustrates the tradeoffs involved in making these choices as the firm traverses a dynamic business environment. In doing so, it raises sensitivity to an important caveat in digital environments epitomized by hyper-competition and transparency.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0276-7783			WOS:000329754600021

STEPHANITIS BLATCHLEYI (HEMIPTERA: TINGIDAE): FIRST HOST-PLANT ASSOCIATION FOR A RARELY COLLECTED LACE BUG								FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST				96	2			673	675					JUN 2013	2013	Stephanitis blatchleyi, described in 1925, is a rarely collected lace bug known only from a few localities in peninsular Florida; its host plants previously were unknown. We observed adults, nymphs, exuviae, and foliar chlorosis on the ericaceous shrub rusty lyonia (Lyonia ferruginea) at a site in Clay County, Florida, from December 2007 to October 2012. Feeding symptoms were confined to leaves of lower branches. Although the tingid was not found elsewhere in Florida on L. ferruginea (or on L. fruticosa), additional fieldwork probably will show that S. blatchleyi is more widespread than suggested by our sampling.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0015-4040			WOS:000320737200054

The representation consists of a hierarchical vocabulary of entities, relations, and attributes, and 33 local grammar rules that permit or prohibit modeling constructs thereby ensuring model consistency. Internal representational consistency is verified by committing the representation to a Protege web ontology language ( OWL) ontology and examining it with the Pellet consistency checker. External representational validity is established by implementing the representation in a Computer Aided Design (CAD) tool and using it to demonstrate that the grammar rules prohibit inconsistent constructs and that the models support physics-based reasoning based on the balance laws of transport phenomena. This representation, including the controlled grammar, can serve, in the future, as a basis for additional reasoning extensions.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1530-9827	1944-7078		WOS:000326185400001

Much smaller quantities of these types of UTSAs are applied to land used for food crops than to land used for animal grain and forage. UTSAs can harbor zoonotic enteric pathogens that may survive for extended periods after application. Additional studies are needed to enhance our understanding of preharvest microbial food safety hazards and control measures pertaining to the application of UTSAs especially for land used to grow produce that may be consumed raw. This document is intended to provide an approach to study design and a framework for defining the scope and type of data required. This document also provides a tool for evaluating the strength of existing data and thus can aid the produce industry and regulatory authorities in identifying additional research needs. Ultimately, this framework provides a means by which researchers can increase consistency among and between studies and facilitates direct comparison of hazards and efficacy of controls applied to different regions, conditions, and practices.									11	0	0	7	0	11			0362-028X	1944-9097		WOS:000326080900023	23726206

In 1037h of observations at times and over regions for which TGFs are expected, 384 new TGFs were found in addition to the 39 TGFs and two Terrestrial Electron Beam events already detected without the new data mode and methodology. Cosmic ray showers were found to be an important background; they show characteristic signatures in the data of both GBM and the Fermi Large Area Telescope Calorimeter that enable their removal, leaving a sample estimated to consist of approximate to 98% TGFs. The sample includes shorter TGFs than previously found with GBM. The true duration distribution likely contains additional short TGFs because their detection by GBM is limited by detector dead time. One-third of this sample has matches with locations from the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN)maps of these locations show the geographic and meteorological features more clearly than maps of spacecraft locations. The intrinsic TGF rate is evaluated using the lightning rate maps of the Lightning Imaging Sensor, accounting for the detection efficiency of GBM as a function of spacecraft-source offset, from which we estimate a global TGF rate of approximate to 400,000 per year. With continuous production of data in the new mode we estimate that GBM will detect approximate to 850 TGFs per year.									33	0	0	0	0	33			2169-9380	2169-9402		WOS:000325217100097

The data from perigee passes near 400km altitude show marked increases in neutral density during the storms and associated increases in horizontal neutral flow speeds. These thermospheric responses are characterized by enhanced meridional neutral flows with peak perturbation amplitudes near 100m/s and relative neutral density enhancements ranging from 50-100%. The increases in the neutral density and meridional flow velocity at equatorial latitudes occur about 5-7h after the initial perturbations are observed in the z component of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), and they persist for 20-30h. The perturbations in the neutral density are in good agreement with temperature increases predicted by an empirical model that has been validated using data from the CHAMP and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment missions, with a maximum lag time of similar to 1-1.5h between the model temperature increases and the observed density perturbations. The model temperatures are in excellent agreement with ground-based low-latitude temperature measurements during the storms. Ground-based wind measurements during one of the storms provide additional data for comparison with the perturbation wind amplitudes measured aboard the satellite.									7	0	0	0	0	7			2169-9380			WOS:000325217100102

The Impact of Influence Tactics in Information System Development Projects: A Control-Loss Perspective								JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS				30	1			191	225		10.2753/MIS0742-1222300106			SUM 2013	2013	Information systems development (ISD) projects are prone to high levels of failure. One of the major reasons attributed to these failures is the inability to harmonize values held by a diverse set of participants in an environment that is characterized by uncertainty due to changing requirements. In this paper, we focus on a relational approach to achieve congruence between a project manager and a team member with respect to influence tactics. Constructs of perceptual congruence and communication congruence that reflect a level of agreement and degree of shared understanding between the project manager and team members are described. A congruence model is constructed and tied to an intermediate outcome variable of control loss. One hundred and thirteen dyadic pairs of project managers and team members are surveyed in order to test the model. The results indicate that having strong relational equity and common understanding can minimize control loss. It is important to consider the perspectives of both the project manager and a team member while formulating and assessing monitoring strategies to promote the success of an ISD project. Especially, encouraging team members to discuss disagreements constructively can motivate them to perform better and keep things under control. Finally, it is critical to address the performance problems as they occur rather than wait until the completion of the project.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0742-1222			WOS:000323353200007

Laser guidance-based cell detection in a microfluidic biochip								JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS				18	6					060502	10.1117/1.JBO.18.6.060502			JUN 2013	2013	We developed a microfluidic biochip to perform laser guidance on two cell types, chick embryonic forebrain neurons and spinal cord neurons. Observation of neurons under a high-magnification microscope, which we obtained from these two cell types, showed no difference in morphology. However, when flowing in the microfluidic channel and simultaneously being laser guided, the two cell types gained quite different guidance speeds under the same experimental conditions. The results demonstrate that different cell types with the same morphology (e. g., size, shape, etc.) can be effectively distinguished from each other by measuring the difference in guidance speeds (the maximum flow speed minus the initial flow speed). This technique is expected to provide a new approach to high-throughput, label-free cell sorting with high sensitivity. (C) The Authors.

J	Naimou, Angela								MASKING FANON								COLLEGE LITERATURE				40	3	SI		38	+					SUM 2013	2013	Since his death in 1962, Frantz Fanon has been an elusive and spectral figure, subjected to an endless process of academic, cultural, and political prosopopoeia. This essay reads John Edgar Wideman's 2008 novel Fanon as a novel that narrates its own failure to give voice to Fanon's life and legacy, a failure that paradoxically enables Wideman to experiment with alternative narrative modes for representing the human personality as a literary and legal category. Wideman's novel invokes narrative genres of personal development that delineate the well-developed person as the normative subject of international human rights and civil law, only to disrupt these genres by subjecting them to processes of fracture and incorporation adapted from Romare Bearden's collage aesthetics. In the novel Fanon, Wideman's collage technique adapts the historical Fanon's trope of the mask in his theories of the human personality in order to refashion the figure of the person as a mask of legal personhood. In doing so, Fanon challenges the figure of the person that lies at the core of contemporary human rights discourse.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0093-3139			WOS:000321723400003		
J	Rapaport, Lisa G.; Kloc, Briana; Warneke, Mark; Mickelberg, Jennifer L.; Ballou, Jonathan D.								Do mothers prefer helpers? Birth sex-ratio adjustment in captive callitrichines								ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR				85	6			1295	1302		10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.03.018			JUN 2013	2013	Parental investment theory predicts that natural selection will favour a parental ability to bias the offspring sex ratio in favour of that which will yield the highest benefit-cost payoff. The local resource enhancement hypothesis posits that in cooperative breeders, parents may favour offspring that will mitigate parental effort by helping to raise younger siblings. Conversely, the fragile male hypothesis suggests that parents will adjust the sex ratio in favour of the sex that experiences higher mortality. We examined international studbook data of two cooperatively breeding primate species with differing reproductive strategies: golden lion tamarins, Leontopithecus rosalia, which typically give birth to twins, and callimicos, Callimico goeldii, which almost always give birth to singletons. The tamarins showed a stronger secondary sex-ratio bias in favour of males than did the callimicos, as predicted by the local resource enhancement hypothesis, because tamarins sustain higher per-parturition costs and because sons may invest more effort in caring for their younger siblings than do daughters. However, a generalized linear regression failed to reveal factors that may influence this variation. There was no significant predictor of male bias based on mother's age, mother's number of previous parturitions or group size. Contrary to predictions of the fragile male hypothesis, sons were no less likely to survive the postnatal period of parental investment than were daughters. A greater understanding of this phenomenon is needed because the adult sex-ratio bias in favour of males has become so pronounced, especially in golden lion tamarins, as to cause management difficulties for the conservation of these endangered species.

Hydrothermal Growth of Single Crystals of Lu3Al5O12 (LuAG) and Its Doped Analogues								CRYSTAL GROWTH & DESIGN				13	6			2298	2306		10.1021/cg3017529			JUN 2013	2013	The growth of Lu3Al5O12 (LuAG) as high quality single crystals using the hydrothermal method is described. The growth protocol is similar to that of Y3Al5O12 (YAG) using binary oxides (Lu2O3 and sapphire) as feedstocks and 2 M K2CO3 as mineralizer. The growth conditions are similar to those of YAG with a dissolution zone temperature of 640 degrees C and a growth zone temperature of 610 degrees C. To grow large crystals, commercially available YAG single crystals with (100) faces were used as surrogate seed crystals. The close lattice match allows for high quality growth of LuAG single crystals on the YAG seeds. Preparation of Lu2O3 doped with a number of lanthanide ions (Nd, Tm, Er, Yb, Ho) in various concentrations is described, and use of these materials as feedstocks leads to formation of doped LuAG. Similarly, a process for the growth of single crystals of Lu3AlxGa(5-x)O12 with Ga doped in the Al site is also provided.

Danielsen, Scott/0000-0003-3432-5578			Properties and Performance of Ether-Functionalized Imidazoles as Physical Solvents for CO2 Separations								ENERGY & FUELS				27	6			3349	3357		10.1021/ef400362b			JUN 2013	2013	Previously, we investigated 1-n-alkylimidazoles as low viscosity, low vapor pressure physical solvents for CO2/CH4 separation and noted a decrease in performance as the length of the n-alkyl chain was extended. Here, we examine imidazoles featuring oligo(ethylene glycol) substituents ("PEG(n)-imidazoles") as an opportunity to improve upon the separation performance of this class of molecules. In the current work, we have characterized the density and the viscosity of PEG(n)-imidazoles over the temperature range 20-80 degrees C. PEG(n)-imidazoles are slightly more viscous than 1-n-alkylimidazoles but still fall below 20 cP. Ideal gas solubilities of CO2 and CH4 were measured in PEG(n)-imidazoles at gas partial pressures of similar to 5 bar and temperatures of 25-70 degrees C. Solubilities of CO2 and CH4 were both found to decrease with increasing temperature, with a stronger dependence for CO2. However, better CO2/CH4 selectivity was achieved in PEG(n)-imidazoles at lower operating temperatures than was observed for 1-n-alkylimidazoles. Physical properties and gas separation performances were correlated with fractional free volume calculated via COSMOtherm, as well as solubility parameters. The results show trends of decreased FFV when polar ether groups comprise the substituent, and that CO2 solubility and solubility selectivity for CO2/CH4 are improved compared to their nonpolar, hydrocarbon-based analogues.									21	1	0	1	0	22			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000320911200051		
J	Herran, C. Leigh; Coutris, Nicole								Drop-on-demand for aqueous solutions of sodium alginate								EXPERIMENTS IN FLUIDS				54	6					1548	10.1007/s00348-013-1548-9			JUN 2013	2013	Inkjet printing is a rapidly growing commercial process for applications that depend on precisely patterning micro-scale droplets. These applications increasingly require complex fluids, introducing viscoelastic properties which play an important role in droplet formation. The objective of this study is to determine how to obtain single, uniform and spherical ("successful") droplets from aqueous solutions of sodium alginate with a piezoelectric drop-on-demand printing method. In order to control the volume and velocities of droplets, the effect on the droplet formation of the characteristics of the waveform such as voltage amplitude and dwell time is studied. The results depend also on the fluid rheology. The viscosity of the chosen fluid is a function of the concentration, as the viscoelastic properties increase at higher concentration. In this paper, the droplet formation process is characterized in terms of both the waveform and the rheological properties of the solution. The characterization of the fluids and waveform will be pursued first and the droplet formation and its control will be studied. Finally, the results will be presented with a map in ranges of the Ohnesorge, Deborah and Weber numbers.									5	0	0	1	0	5			0723-4864			WOS:000321262300011

Time stepping in discontinuous Galerkin method								JOURNAL OF HYDRODYNAMICS				25	3			321	329		10.1016/S1001-6058(11)60370-4			JUN 2013	2013	The time discretization in the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme has been traditionally based on the Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) second-order Runge-Kutta (RK2) scheme. Computational efficiency and accuracy with the Euler Forward (EF) and the TVD second-order RK2 time stepping schemes in the DG method are investigated in this work. Numerical tests are conducted with the scalar Burgers equation, 1-D and 2-D shallow water flow equations. The maximum Courant number or time step size required for stability for the EF scheme and RK2 scheme with different slope limiters are compared. Numerical results show that the slope limiters affect the stability requirement in the DG method. The RK2 scheme is generally more diffusive than the EF scheme, and the RK2 scheme allows larger time step sizes. The EF scheme is found to be more efficient and accurate than the RK2 scheme in the DG method in computation.									4	2	0	0	0	4			1001-6058			WOS:000321420400001

In this study, the measurement of biomass composition (lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose) and proximate (fixed carbon, volatile matter, ash and moisture contents) components was conducted on leaf and tissue samples from diverse Sorghum bicolor genotypes across two environments. Multiple regression analysis was used to create models that predict two biomass conversion traits: hydrolysis yield potential (HYP) and crystallinity index (CI). CI model variables included tissue type, ash and lignin. HYP model variables included tissue type, ash, cellulose and volatile matter. The presence of ash content in all models was a salient finding of our study. Given that several models were able to predict HYP and CI in alternate grow-out years, these models may be useful in selective breeding programmes aimed at sorghum bioenergy feedstock improvement through increased conversion efficiency.									5	0	0	1	0	5			0179-9541			WOS:000320117800003		
J	Oberdan, Angelina								Like a Caterpillar Losing its Cocoon: Rediscovery of Self in Marisa Labozzetta's Thieves Never Steal in the Rain								RELIGIONS				4	2			283	287		10.3390/rel4020283			JUN 2013	2013	We ward off loss as best we can, but rarely are we so lucky. We attach significance to our rituals and collected items. This theme of warding off loss and searching for ways to cope with it is woven through the linked stories of Marisa Labozzetta's Thieves Never Steal in the Rain, especially in the stories about Joanna and Barbara. Barbara's ritualistic collecting links her directly to the past. Through these objects, the past and present become fluid for Barbara, and she believes that they can even affect her future. Because of this, she gathers objects in an attempt to preserve her luckiness as she has been since she was a child. This idea of actively working against or shielding oneself and loved ones from loss is also apparent in Labozetta's stories that feature Joanna. Joanna's daughter, Jill, died in a terrible accident, and Joanna blames herself because she thinks she should have been able to prevent Jill's death. Joanna also emphasizes the importance of things in a way that is similar to Barbara's. When she thinks she has lost her artistic eye, Joanna reclaims the things from her childhood desk. Unfortunately, and despite their best efforts, neither Joanna nor Barbara is able to stave off loss forever: Barbara's house burns down and Jill cannot be resurrected. However, Barbara feels liberated after her house burns, and Joanna rediscovers her artistic eye. Perhaps what we need to remember, and what the stories in Marisa Labozzetta's Thieves Never Steal in the Rain remind us, is that we can't prevent loss and somehow we have to cope with it. In coping with the loss, we can rediscover our best selves.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2077-1444			WOS:000321257300008		
J	Peng, Fei; Erdman, Rebecca; Van Laningham, Gregg; Speyer, Robert F.; Campbell, Robert								Thermal Conductivity of ZrB2SiCB4C from 25 to 2000 degrees C								ADVANCED ENGINEERING MATERIALS				15	6			425	433		10.1002/adem.201200298			JUN 2013	2013	The thermal diffusivities of ZrB2-SiC (10.7, 21.9, or 48.7vol% SiC) with B4C sintering aid were measured over 25-2000 degrees C using laser flash. The composition with the highest SiC showed the highest thermal conductivity (k) at 25 degrees C, but the lowest above approximate to 400 degrees C, because of the greater k temperature sensitivity of the SiC phase. Finite difference calculations of k, using selected literature data for the individual phases, and the concentration of phases from microstructures, correctly predicted temperature and phase concentration dependencies, but were lower than experimental results. The k of pure ZrB2 and SiC as a function of temperature were back-calculated from the experimental results for the multi-phase materials; they were in good agreement with specific literature values.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1438-1656			WOS:000320187200003

Current LCA methods are effective for established systems; however, lack of data often inhibits robust analysis of future products or processes that may benefit the most from life cycle information. In many cases the life cycle inventory (LCI) of a system can change depending on its development pathway. Modeling emerging systems allows insights into probable trends and a greater understanding of the effect of future scenarios on LCA results. The proposed framework uses Bayesian probabilities to model technology adoption. The method presents a unique approach to modeling system evolution and can be used independently or within the context of an agent-based model (ABM). LCA can be made more robust and dynamic by using this framework to couple scenario modeling with life cycle data, analyzing the effect of decision-making patterns over time. Potential uses include examining the changing urban metabolism of growing cities, understanding the development of renewable energy technologies, identifying transformations in material flows over space and time, and forecasting industrial networks for developing products. A switchgrass-to-energy case demonstrates the approach.									8	0	0	6	0	8			1088-1980			WOS:000320040500005

The compositions and filling fractions were confirmed with a combination of Rietveld refinement and elemental analysis. The thermoelectric properties were evaluated from 300 K to 810 K. The Seebeck coefficient and resistivity increase while the thermal conductivity decreases with increasing Yb content. A maximum ZT value of 0.85 was obtained at 810 K. This work is part of a continuing effort to enhance the thermoelectric properties of p-type skutterudites, as this class of materials continues to be of interest for thermoelectrics applications.

It has been utilized for disease prevention and health care since ancient age. To explore the chemicals responsible for the health benefits, water-soluble polysaccharides were extracted from longan flesh in this work. A pure polysaccharide (LPS1) was obtained through column I purification. Analysis by gas chromatography showed LPS1 was a homopolysaccharide of glucose with glycosidic linkage of -> 6)-D-Glc-(1 ->. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra indicated that the configuration of anomeric carbon in glucose residual was a-form. The polysaccharide structure was further confirmed to be (1 -> 46)-alpha-n-glucan by chemcial shift of C6. The molecular weight of LPS1 was calculated to be 108 kDa, which had 661 glucose residuals. Anticancer assay showed that LPS1 had anticancer activity against certain extent. However, it did not show any cytotoxicity against MCF-7 breast cancer cells.									32	0	0	22	0	32			1525-7797			WOS:000320356000033	23617585	
J	Im, Kun Shin; Grover, Varun; Teng, James T. C.								Do Large Firms Become Smaller by Using Information Technology?								INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH				24	2			470	491		10.1287/isre.1120.0439			JUN 2013	2013	The relationship between information technology (IT) and a key organizational design variable, firm size, is an important area of study, particularly given the ongoing transition to an information-based economy. To better understand the more nuanced aspects of the relationship, we formulated a bidirectional and time-lagged model that incorporates different perspectives from organizational theories and transaction cost economics. Our two models-the bidirectional and one-year lagged model and the bidirectional and two-year lagged model-were tested using nine-year panel data on IT spending, IT stock, coordination costs, firm size, and relevant control variables for 277 manufacturing firms. We found a sequential interaction between IT and firm size in both of the two models: as a firm grows in size, its coordination activities increase; the firm then uses more IT to handle the increased activities of coordination; this increased use of IT, in turn, decreases coordination costs, and eventually, the size of the firm decreases. It was also found that the presence of coordination costs is necessary for the sequential interaction between IT and firm size, indicating coordination between and within firms is a major reason for firms to invest in IT and for IT effect to take place on firm size. This study has taken an initial step by attempting to empirically examine dual causality and longitudinal effects between IT and firm size, and to reconcile different theoretical perspectives on the relationship between them. We hope this work can act as a catalyst for developing a better understanding of the complex relationship between IT and organizations, with the ultimate goal of offering robust prescriptions for successful structural change.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1047-7047			WOS:000319861400015

Photoluminescence (PL) from the QDs inside the glass matrix was observed in the visible (CdSe/ZnS) and near-IR (PbS) regions. Properties of the QDs were found to be environment dependent, with the amine solvent partially quenching the luminescence. The PL lifetime of the CdSe/ZnS CSQDs and PbS QDs in the glass film was decreased to varying degrees from that of the QDs in pure chloroform. Monitoring the steady-state PL intensity and luminescence lifetime of PbS doped films showed that appropriate heat treatment of the deposited film increases the luminescence efficiency by removing residual solvent from the glass matrix.

Their structures were investigated with single-crystal X-ray diffraction at ambient conditions and at high pressures using diamond anvil cells. The results of this study indicate that the two materials, with chains of face-sharing tricapped trigonal prisms ThF9 and with layers of square antiprisms ThF8 sharing their edges in Th2F14 doublets, respectively, are structurally stable at least to about 9 GPa at room temperature. This observation suggests that, in general, moderate high pressure has no effect on the coordination polyhedra around the Th atoms and the topology of the structure of complex thorium fluorides. The bulk compressibility of the thorium fluorides entirely depends on the alkali metal present in the structure. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Age-related changes in cognition may make traditional strategies of integrating and understanding existing (i.e., paper-based) health information more difficult for older adults. The centralized and integrated nature of health information, as well as the long-term tracking capabilities present in many PHRs, may be especially beneficial for older patients' management of health. However, older adults tend to be late adopters of technology and may be hesitant to adopt a PHR if the benefits are not made clear (perceived usefulness). Toward the design of a useful PHR, a needs analysis was conducted to determine how people currently manage their health information, what they perceive as useful, and to identify any unmet needs. This paper describes two qualitative studies examining the health information needs of both younger and older adults. The first study used a 2-week diary methodology to examine everyday health questions or concerns, while the second study examined maintenance of health information and perceptions of PHRs through the use of a three-part interview. User's perceptions of the usefulness of PHRs are provided as recommendations for the design of e-health technology, especially those targeted for older adult healthcare consumers. The results suggest that both older and younger adults would deem a PHR useful if it provides memory support in the form of reminders, provides tools to aid in comprehension of one's health concerns, is interactive and provides automatic functions, and is highly accessible to authorized users, yet one's information is kept secure and private.									5	0	0	1	0	5			1615-5289			WOS:000319434800005

This experiment quantified bicyclists' estimates of the distance at which approaching drivers would first recognize them. Twenty five participants (including 13 bicyclists who rode at least once per week, and 12 who rode once per month or less) cycled in place on a closed-road circuit at night-time and indicated when they were confident that an approaching driver would first recognize that a bicyclist was present. Participants wore black clothing alone or together with a fluorescent bicycling vest, a fluorescent bicycling vest with additional retroreflective tape, or the fluorescent retroreflective vest plus ankle and knee reflectors in a modified 'biomotion' configuration. The bicycle had a light mounted on the handlebars which was either static, flashing or off. Participants judged that black clothing made them least visible, retroreflective strips on the legs in addition to a retroreflective vest made them most visible and that adding retroreflective materials to a fluorescent vest provides no conspicuity benefits. Flashing bicycle lights were associated with higher conspicuity than static lights. Additionally, occasional bicyclists judged themselves to be more visible than did frequent bicyclists. Overall, bicyclists overestimated their conspicuity compared to previously collected recognition distances and underestimated the conspicuity benefits of retroreflective markings on their ankles and knees. Participants mistakenly judged that a fluorescent vest that did not include retroreflective material would enhance their night-time conspicuity. These findings suggest that bicyclists have dangerous misconceptions concerning the magnitude of the night-time conspicuity problem and the potential value of conspicuity treatments.

A comparison of the proposed inductor material to conventional inductor material e.g., copper, in terms of both component footprint and material volume, indicate a greater quality factor (Q = omega L/R) through the use of the CCNTs.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0741-3106			WOS:000319460800030		
J	Shen, Haiying; Zhao, Lianyu								ALERT: An Anonymous Location-Based Efficient Routing Protocol in MANETs								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MOBILE COMPUTING				12	6			1079	1093		10.1109/TMC.2012.65			JUN 2013	2013	Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) use anonymous routing protocols that hide node identities and/or routes from outside observers in order to provide anonymity protection. However, existing anonymous routing protocols relying on either hop-by-hop encryption or redundant traffic, either generate high cost or cannot provide full anonymity protection to data sources, destinations, and routes. The high cost exacerbates the inherent resource constraint problem in MANETs especially in multimedia wireless applications. To offer high anonymity protection at a low cost, we propose an Anonymous Location-based Efficient Routing proTocol (ALERT). ALERT dynamically partitions the network field into zones and randomly chooses nodes in zones as intermediate relay nodes, which form a nontraceable anonymous route. In addition, it hides the data initiator/ receiver among many initiators/ receivers to strengthen source and destination anonymity protection. Thus, ALERT offers anonymity protection to sources, destinations, and routes. It also has strategies to effectively counter intersection and timing attacks. We theoretically analyze ALERT in terms of anonymity and efficiency. Experimental results exhibit consistency with the theoretical analysis, and show that ALERT achieves better route anonymity protection and lower cost compared to other anonymous routing protocols. Also, ALERT achieves comparable routing efficiency to the GPSR geographical routing protocol.									14	1	0	0	0	15			1536-1233			WOS:000319409900004

Localization of Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Bisphosphate to Lipid Rafts and Uroids in the Human Protozoan Parasite Entamoeba histolytica								INFECTION AND IMMUNITY				81	6			2145	2155		10.1128/IAI.00040-13			JUN 2013	2013	Entamoeba histolytica is an intestinal protozoan parasite and is the causative agent of amoebiasis. During invasive infection, highly motile amoebae destroy the colonic epithelium, enter the blood circulation, and disseminate to other organs such as liver, causing liver abscess. Motility is a key factor in E. histolytica pathogenesis, and this process relies on a dynamic actomyosin cytoskeleton. In other systems, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P-2] is known to regulate a wide variety of cellular functions, including signal transduction, actin remodeling, and cell motility. Little is known about the role of PI(4,5)P-2 in E. histolytica pathogenicity. In this study, we demonstrate that PI(4,5)P-2 is localized to cholesterol-rich microdomains, lipid rafts, and the actin-rich fractions of the E. histolytica membrane. Microscopy revealed that the trailing edge of polarized trophozoites, uroids, are highly enriched in lipid rafts and their constituent lipid, PI(4,5)P-2. Polarization and enrichment of uroids and rafts with PI(4,5)P-2 were enhanced upon treatment of E. histolytica cells with cholesterol. Exposure to cholesterol also increased intracellular calcium, which is a downstream effector of PI(4,5)P-2, with a concomitant increase in motility. Together, our data suggest that in E. histolytica, PI(4,5)P-2 may signal from lipid rafts and cholesterol may play a role in triggering PI(4,5)P-2-mediated signaling to enhance the motility of this pathogen.									8	0	0	8	0	8			0019-9567			WOS:000318855100031	23545298

The adhesive of adult barnacles has received much attention over the years; however, the permanent adhesive of the cyprid - the colonisation stage of barnacles - is a material about which very little is presently known. We applied confocal laser-scanning microscopy to the measurement of contact angles between the permanent adhesive of barnacle cyprid larvae and self-assembled monolayers of OH- and CH3-terminated thiols. Measurement of contact angles between actual bioadhesives and surfaces has never previously been achieved and the data may provide insight into the physicochemical properties and mechanism of action of these functional materials. The adhesive is a dual-phase system post-secretion, with the behaviour of the components governed separately by the surface chemistry. The findings imply that the cyprid permanent adhesion process is more complex than previously thought, necessitating broad re-evaluation of the system. Improved understanding will have significant implications for the production of barnacle-resistant coatings as well as development of bio-inspired glues for niche applications.									9	0	0	7	0	9			0022-0949			WOS:000319117400011	23430996

Using Kestrel and XMPP to Support the STAR Experiment in the Cloud								JOURNAL OF GRID COMPUTING				11	2			249	264		10.1007/s10723-013-9253-8			JUN 2013	2013	This paper presents the results and experiences of adapting and improving the Many-Task Computing (MTC) framework Kestrel for use with bag of tasks applications and the STAR experiment in particular. Kestrel is a lightweight, highly available job scheduling framework for Virtual Organization Clusters (VOCs) constructed in the cloud. Kestrel uses the Extensible Message and Presence Protocol (XMPP) for increasing MTC platform scalability and mitigating faults in Wide Area Network (WAN) communications. Kestrel's architecture is based upon pilot job frameworks used extensively in Grid computing, with fault-tolerant communications inspired by command-and-control botnets. The extensibility of XMPP has allowed development of protocols for identifying manager nodes, discovering the capabilities of worker agents, and for distributing tasks. Presence notifications provided by XMPP allow Kestrel to monitor the global state of the pool and to perform task dispatching based on worker availability. Since its inception, Kestrel has been modified based on its performance managing operational scientific workloads from the STAR group at Brookhaven National Laboratories. STAR provided a virtual machine image with applications for simulating proton collisions using PYTHIA and GEANT3. A Kestrel-based Virtual Organization Cluster, created on top of Clemson University's Palmetto cluster, CERN, and Amazon EC2, was able to provide over 400,000 CPU hours of computation over the course of a month using an average of 800 virtual machine instances every day, generating nearly seven terabytes of data and the largest PYTHIA production run that STAR has achieved to date.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1570-7873	1572-9184		WOS:000319229700005

Sensitivity of Load Distribution in Light-Framed Wood Roof Systems due to Typical Modeling Parameters								JOURNAL OF PERFORMANCE OF CONSTRUCTED FACILITIES				27	3			222	234		10.1061/(ASCE)CF.1943-5509.0000323			JUN 2013	2013	Because failure of roof systems in past high wind events has demonstrated the consequences of not maintaining a continuous load path from the roof to the foundation, many studies have been conducted to better understand this load path, including how loads are distributed in the system. The current study looks to add to the current knowledge of the vertical load path by focusing on uplift loads and by considering the sensitivity of different modeling parameters. This is done by developing and assessing load influence coefficient contours for various roof-towall (RTW) connections. An analytical model of a light-framed wood structure using finite-element software is developed. The model has a gable roof system comprised of fink trusses and is modeled in a highly detailed fashion including the explicit modeling of each connector/nail in the system. The influence coefficient plots indicate that the distribution of loads is indeed sensitive to the overall stiffness of RTW connections but is not overly sensitive to their relative stiffnesses. This was investigated by looking at cases where all connections have the same stiffness and cases where they can have different stiffnesses. However, the relative stiffness begins to have a larger impact as they begin to soften because of yielding. Furthermore, the stiffness of the sheathing connectors did not appear to have much of an impact on the distribution of load, but the sheathing stiffness itself did have a notable impact.

The high permeability of the microcolumn allows for operation under syringe pump or HPLC driven flow, ultimately providing greater mass spectral clarity and accurate molecular weight determinations for different protein/buffer combinations. Studies presented here focus on the desalting of several target proteins from a standard phosphate buffered saline (PBS) matrix and a synthetic urine solution prior to ESI-MS determinations. In every case, responses for mu M-level proteins in PBS improve from the situation of not permitting molecular weight determinations to values that are precise to better than +/- 10 Da, without internal standards, with relative improvements in the signal-to-background ratios (S/B) on the order of 3,000x. De-salting of a myoglobin-spiked (12 mu M) synthetic urine results in equally-improved spectral quality.									8	1	0	2	0	8			1044-0305			WOS:000318844100021	23463546

Do Hummocks Provide a Physiological Advantage to Even the Most Flood Tolerant of Tidal Freshwater Trees?								WETLANDS				33	3			399	408		10.1007/s13157-013-0397-x			JUN 2013	2013	Hummock and hollow microtopography is pervasive in tidal freshwater swamps. Many tree species grow atop hummocks significantly more than in hollows, leading to the hypothesis that hummocks provide preferred locations for maximizing physiological proficiency of inhabiting trees that experience repeated flooding. We used thermal dissipation probes to measure the ecophysiological proficiency of a very flood-tolerant tree, Taxodium distichum, as manifested through in-situ changes in sapflow (a proxy for transpiration) in 11 trees on hummocks and 11 trees in hollows. Overall, sapflow increased significantly by 3.3 g H2O m(-2) s(-1) (11 %) in trees on both hummocks and hollows during flooding, contrary to our expectations. We found no significant differences in sapflow rates between T. distichum trees positioned on hummocks versus hollows in relation to discrete flood events. Coincidentally, hummock elevations were equivalent to the flood depths that promoted greatest physiological proficiency in T. distichum, suggesting a physiological role for the maintenance of hummock height in tidal swamps. While we reject our original hypotheses that flooding and positioning in hollows will reduce sapflow in T. distichum, this research reveals a potentially important feedback between hummock height, flood depth, and maximum tree physiological response.									5	0	0	3	0	5			0277-5212			WOS:000318797900002

Post-event investigations of this failure found uncertain strength parameters and deteriorating anchor systems as the most likely causes for failure. Field measurement after the event indicated an average slip surface of inclination 15 degrees. To account for the uncertainties in input parameters, the probabilistic back analysis approach was adopted. First, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation was used to back-calculate the geotechnical strength parameters and the anchor force. These inverse analysis results, which agreed closely with the findings of the post-event investigations, were then used to validate the maximum likelihood (ML) method, a computationally more efficient back-analysis approach. The improved knowledge of the geotechnical strength parameters and the anchor force gained through the probabilistic inverse analysis better elucidated the slope failure mechanism, which provides a basis for a more rational selection of remedial measures.

HMMs are widely used to model real-world systems. Like graph matching, some previous approaches compare HMMs by evaluating the correspondence, or goodness of match, between every pair of states, concentrating on the structure of the models instead of the statistics of the process being observed. To remedy this, we present a new metric space that compares the statistics of HMMs within a given level of statistical significance. Compared with the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which is another widely used approach for measuring model similarity, our approach is a true metric, can always return an appropriate distance value, and provides a confidence measure on the metric value. Experimental results are given for a sample application, which quantify the similarity of HMMs of network traffic in the Tor anonymization system. This application is interesting since it considers models extracted from a system that is intentionally trying to obfuscate its internal workings. In the conclusion, we discuss applications in less-challenging domains, such as data mining.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2168-2267			WOS:000319010000001	23047878

Gas Metal Arc Welding Process Modeling and Prediction of Weld Microstructure in MIL A46100 Armor-Grade Martensitic Steel								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				22	6			1541	1557		10.1007/s11665-012-0445-3			JUN 2013	2013	A conventional gas metal arc welding (GMAW) butt-joining process has been modeled using a two-way fully coupled, transient, thermal-mechanical finite-element procedure. To achieve two-way thermal-mechanical coupling, the work of plastic deformation resulting from potentially high thermal stresses is allowed to be dissipated in the form of heat, and the mechanical material model of the workpiece and the weld is made temperature dependent. Heat losses from the deposited filler-metal are accounted for by considering conduction to the adjoining workpieces as well as natural convection and radiation to the surroundings. The newly constructed GMAW process model is then applied, in conjunction with the basic material physical-metallurgy, to a prototypical high-hardness armor martensitic steel (MIL A46100). The main outcome of this procedure is the prediction of the spatial distribution of various crystalline phases within the weld and the heat-affected zone regions, as a function of the GMAW process parameters. The newly developed GMAW process model is validated by comparing its predictions with available open-literature experimental and computational data.									13	0	0	0	0	13			1059-9495			WOS:000318903000003

In recent years, the most significant improvements in ZT have mainly been due to successful reduction of thermal conductivity. However, thermal conductivity is difficult to measure directly at high temperatures. Combined measurements of thermal diffusivity, specific heat, and mass density are a widely used alternative to direct measurement of thermal conductivity. In this work, thermal conductivity is shown to be the factor in the calculation of ZT with the greatest measurement uncertainty. The International Energy Agency (IEA) group, under the implementing agreement for Advanced Materials for Transportation (AMT), has conducted two international round-robins since 2009. This paper, part II of our report on the international round-robin testing of transport properties of bulk bismuth telluride, focuses on thermal diffusivity, specific heat, and thermal conductivity measurements.									46	0	0	1	0	46			0361-5235			WOS:000318569300020

Elementary and secondary groups were also compared. Data were drawn from the Special Education Elementary Longitudinal Study (SEELS). The sample consisted of 2,950 students ages 8 to 14 (Grades 1 -9) at the time of Wave 1 data collection. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used in the data analysis. It was found that, at the elementary level, Wave 1 academic achievement predicted Wave 2 self-concept and Wave 1 self-concept predicted Wave 2 achievement. Parent home involvement was a significant predictor for Wave 1 academic achievement. At the secondary level, family SES was a significant predictor for both Wave 1 academic achievement and self-concept.

We consider whether and how Arab-American representation shifted following September 11th as the group's social status changed rapidly. Methods We analyze the determinants of Senate voting alongside the Arab-American Institute from 2000 to 2008. We employ ordinary least square (OLS) regression models that account for the time series cross-sectional (TSCS) nature of our panel data. Results Our findings suggest that Arab-American representation significantly declined in the wake of September 11th, both among Democratic and Republican senators. As the political environment improved over time, representation slowly rose in subsequent years. Conclusions We show that the quality of Arab-American representation declined after September 11th despite no significant change in either their size or in electoral outcomes. We also show that broad theories of minority representation apply to even small ethnic groups, as the determinants of Arab-American representation parallel those of African Americans and Latinos.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0038-4941			WOS:000318305600014

More than 90% of the installed PV capacity employs bulk-silicon solar cells. Engineering problems that include thermal and optical challenges have not permitted the large-scale commercialization of concentration PV systems, lack of functional reliability- and the concomitant lack of economic bankability-being a major barrier. For increasing the efficiency of single-junction cells beyond the Shockley-Queisser limit, several approaches based on concepts such as multiple exciton generation, carrier multiplication, hot-carrier extraction, etc., have been proposed; however, these do not seem to be commercially viable. Since both bulk-silicon and thin-film (amorphous silicon, cadmium telluride, and copper indium gallium selenide) solar cells remain as the only two commercially viable options for terrestrial PV applications, a multi-terminal multi-junction architecture appears promising for inexpensive PV electricity generation with efficiency exceeding the currently feasible 25%. The architecture exploits the present commercial silicon solar cells along with abundant and ultra-low-cost materials such as Cu2O. With the availability of well-controlled manufacturing processes at the sub 2-nm length scale, it will become possible to manufacture ultra-high efficiency and ultra-low cost PV electricity generation modules based on silicon.									11	0	0	0	0	11			2168-6734			WOS:000209707700001

To predict effects of timber harvests in riparian areas on bats, more information is needed on the functional width of riparian zones for bats, and how bats respond to forest removal near small perennial streams. From May to August (2004-2007), we studied bat presence and activity in 1 unharvested site and 3 harvested sites with different riparian-buffer sizes (0 m, 10 m, and 30 m) in the southern Appalachian Mountains of the United States. We measured activity at 3 distances from the stream in each site (0 m, stream; 23 m, mid; and 46 m, far), classified bat calls by phonic group, and tested the effect of harvest on overall activity, detection, and naive occupancy rates for 4 phonic groups. Pre-harvest activity was higher at the far versus stream or mid positions. Position, harvest, and interactions affected post-harvest change in activity in the treatment sites. Pre- and post-harvest activity was similar at all positions in the 30-m site. Activity increased significantly in the 0-m and 10-m sites, likely due to the presence of edge after harvest. Detection probabilities were higher post-harvest for larger bats and occupancy of 0-m and 10-m sites was higher post-harvest for all phonic groups except Myotis. Post-harvest responses suggest that the functional width of riparian zones in our study area is >= 10 m. This study is the first to test the effects of harvesting on use of riparian forests by bats; further long-term landscape-scale studies are needed.

J	Wei, Na; Finneran, Kevin T.				Wei, Na/C-9172-2014				Low and high acetate amendments are equally as effective at promoting complete dechlorination of trichloroethylene (TCE)								BIODEGRADATION				24	3			413	425		10.1007/s10532-012-9598-x			JUN 2013	2013	Experiments with trichloroethylene-contaminated aquifer material demonstrated that TCE, cis-DCE, and VC were completely degraded with concurrent Fe(III) or Fe(III) and sulfate reduction when acetate was amended at stoichiometric concentration; competing TEAPs did not inhibit ethene production. Adding 10x more acetate did not increase the rate or extent of TCE reduction, but only increased methane production. Enrichment cultures demonstrated that similar to 90 mu M TCE or similar to 22 mu M VC was degraded primarily to ethene within 20 days with concurrent Fe(III) or Fe(III) + sulfate reduction. The dechlorination rates were comparable between the low and high acetate concentrations (0.36 vs 0.34 day(-1), respectively), with a slightly slower rate in the 10x acetate amended incubations. Methane accumulated to 13.5 (+/- 0.5) mu mol/tube in the TCE-degrading incubations with 10x acetate, and only 1.4 (+/- 0.1) mu mol/tube with low acetate concentration. Methane accumulated to 16 (+/- 1.5) mu mol/tube in VC-degrading enrichment with 10x acetate and 2 (+/- 0.1) mu mol/tube with stoichiometric acetate. The estimated fraction of electrons distributed to methanogenesis increased substantially when excessive acetate was added. Quantitative PCR analysis indicated that 10x acetate did not enhance Dehalococcoides biomass but rather increased the methanogen abundance by nearly one order of magnitude compared to that with stoichiometric acetate. The data suggest that adding low levels of substrate may be equally if not more effective as high concentrations, without producing excessive methane. This has implications for field remediation efforts, in that adding excess electron donor may not benefit the reactions of interest, which in turn will increase treatment costs without direct benefit to the stakeholders.									7	0	0	6	0	7			0923-9820			WOS:000318278000010	23064845	
J	Green, Benjamin R.; Bain, Lisa J.								Mrp2 is involved in the efflux and disposition of fosinopril								JOURNAL OF APPLIED TOXICOLOGY				33	6			458	465		10.1002/jat.1767			JUN 2013	2013	The multidrug-resistance-associated proteins 1 and 2 (MRP1/MRP2) are transporters responsible for the efflux of drugs and endogenous compounds. Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells transfected with the human MRP1 or MRP2 genes were used to assess whether several widely used pharmaceuticals are potential substrates by examining their differential toxicity, accumulation and efflux. Loratadine, an antihistamine, was 1.4-fold less toxic to MRP1 cells and its retention was 1.3-fold lower than that from MDCK control cells. Fosinopril, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, was 2.4-fold less toxic and its retention was 4.5-fold lower in MRP2-transfected cells compared with control cells. To determine whether fosinopril contributed to a drugdrug interaction, fosinopril efflux was examined in vitro in combination with other known or suspected MRP2 substrates over a period of 20min. When fosinopril was coincubated with desloratadine, loratadine or methotrexate, its retention was increased by 2-, 4.7- and 2-fold, respectively, which likely indicates that a drugdrug interaction is occurring. In vivo studies were conducted, in which FVB wild-type and FVB/Mrp2/ mice were dosed with fosinopril and the known MRP2 substrate methotrexate, and tissues collected after 1h. In mice lacking Mrp2, drug levels were reduced in the intestine by 1.5-fold, but increased in the liver, serum and kidneys, by 2.1-, 2.9- and 3-fold, respectively. These data suggest that, in the absence of Mrp2, fosinopril alters the retention of a second drug. These findings will help increase our understanding of the role that MRP2 plays in altering the retention and disposition of coadministered pharmaceuticals.

J	Grayson, J. Michael; Pang, Weichiang; Schiff, Scott								Building envelope failure assessment framework for residential communities subjected to hurricanes								ENGINEERING STRUCTURES				51				245	258		10.1016/j.engstruct.2013.01.027			JUN 2013	2013	This paper presents a modular framework utilized to assess the building envelope failures of light-frame wood construction subjected to hurricane wind hazards. A component-based approach is taken to develop an integrated building envelope model that is based on previous research of individual component capacities. Key modules of the proposed framework include a wind-borne Debris Generation Module and an impact-tracking module that interact with a Hurricane Simulation Module capable of simulating suites of synthetic or historical hurricanes. A significant difference between the proposed framework and other assessment models is that the proposed framework is extremely flexible in allowing the user to define the building stock within the area of interest, which will provide the user with the ability to investigate an unlimited number of "what if" scenarios. Another distinction of the proposed framework is that it is driven by a mechanics-based three-dimensional probabilistic debris trajectory model developed by the authors as opposed to incorporating empirical fragility curves developed from observed post-hurricane assessments, insurance claim data, or basic probabilistic analyses of wind-borne debris. As an illustrative example of results provided by the proposed framework, a debris impact vulnerability envelope presented in a polar coordinate system are developed for a representative South Carolina coastal subdivision subjected to Hurricane Hugo. The probabilities obtained from the debris impact vulnerability envelope generated by the framework can be utilized by officials, developers, architects, and designers either pre- or post-construction to mitigate damage to the building envelope of homes within a residential community located within hurricane-prone regions.

J	Huang, Yu-Chih; Backman, Sheila J.; Backman, Kenneth F.; Moore, DeWayne								Exploring user acceptance of 3D virtual worlds in travel and tourism marketing								TOURISM MANAGEMENT				36				490	501		10.1016/j.tourman.2012.09.009			JUN 2013	2013	The virtual world of Second Life provides opportunities for companies in communicating marketing messages to targeted markets and capturing the attention of potential customers. Second Life has also been used by the travel and tourism industry as a collaborative and commercial tool for communicating with travelers in marketing tourism destinations (e.g. Tourism Ireland) as well as business management (e.g. Starwood Hotels; Crowne Plaza; STA travel agents). However, few studies have applied formal theory to understand the significance of virtual worlds to tourism destination marketing. The purpose of our study was to develop a research framework identifying the factors that affect tourists' experience and behavioral intentions within a 3D tourism destination by examining the applicability of the Technology Acceptance Model and Hedonic Theory. From a theoretical point of view, this study provides a research framework to capture the entertainment nature of virtual worlds and to reflect the concept that people in these worlds are technology users as well as potential consumers; it does so by extending the Technology Acceptance Model to incorporate the hedonic elements of enjoyment, emotional involvement, positive emotions, and flow experience for understanding the use of 3D virtual worlds within the context of travel and tourism. For destination managers, this study could help in designing engaging and interactive 3D tourism destination sites that contribute to an increase in people's interests in visiting the tourism destination in the future.

Adaptive penalized quantile regression for high dimensional data								JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE				143	6			1029	1038		10.1016/j.jspi.2012.12.009			JUN 2013	2013	We propose a new adaptive L-1 penalized quantile regression estimator for high-dimensional sparse regression models with heterogeneous error sequences. We show that under weaker conditions compared with alternative procedures, the adaptive L-1 quantile regression selects the true underlying model with probability converging to one, and the unique estimates of nonzero coefficients it provides have the same asymptotic normal distribution as the quantile estimator which uses only the covariates with nonzero impact on the response. Thus, the adaptive L-1 quantile regression enjoys oracle properties. We propose a completely data driven choice of the penalty level lambda(n), which ensures good performance of the adaptive L-1 quantile regression. Extensive Monte Carlo simulation studies have been conducted to demonstrate the finite sample performance of the proposed method. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Here we demonstrate application of a ratiometric probe for pH quantification in T brucei glycosomes. The probe consists of a peptide encoding the peroxisomal targeting sequence (F-PTS1, acetyl-CKGGAKL) coupled to fluorescein, which responds to pH. When incubated with living parasites, the probe is internalized within vesicular structures that colocalize with a glycosomal marker. Inhibition of uptake of F-PTS1 at 4 degrees C and pulse- chase colocalization with fluorescent dextran suggested that the probe is initially taken up by non-receptor-mediated endocytosis but is subsequently transported separately from dextran and localized within glycosomes, prior to the final fusion of labeled glycosomes and lysosomes as part of glycosomal turnover. Intraorganellar measurements and pH calibration with F-PTS1 in T. brucei glycosomes indicate that the resting glycosomal pH under physiological conditions is 7.4 +/- 0.2. However, incubation in glucose-depleted buffer triggered mild acidification of the glycosome over a period of 20 min, with a final observed pH of 6.8 +/- 03. This glycosomal acidification was reversed by reintroduction of glucose. Coupling of ratiometric fluorescent sensors and reporters to PTS peptides offers an invaluable tool for monitoring in situ glycosomal response(s) to changing environmental conditions and could be applied to additional kinetoplastid parasites.									7	0	0	4	0	7			0006-2960			WOS:000319795500005	23651061

However, the number of the RNA-protein complex structures solved by experiments is still limited at present. To solve this problem, some computational protocols have been proposed to predict three-dimensional RNA-protein complex structures. But the prediction accuracies of these protocols are lower. The reason may be that these protocols don't fully incorporate the features of RNA-protein interfaces. Here we propose a novel computational protocol for three-dimensional RNA-protein complex structure prediction, 3dRPC, which applies new schemes to the discreteness of molecule and charge in docking algorithm and the construction of the reference state in scoring function in order to take account of the features of RNA-protein interfaces. This protocol achieves a high accuracy comparable to the well-developed algorithms for three-dimensional structure prediction of protein-protein complexes when tested on a RNA-protein docking benchmark.									20	1	0	12	0	21			2045-2322			WOS:000319495700001	23712416

Toxicity from exposure to crude oil can affect populations of fish that live or breed in oiled habitats as seen following the Exxon Valdez oil spill. In an ongoing study of the effects of Deepwater Horizon crude oil on fish, Gulf killifish (Fundulus grandis) were collected from an oiled site (Grande Terre, LA) and two reference locations (coastal MS and AL) and monitored for measures of exposure to crude oil. Killifish collected from Grande Terre had divergent gene expression in the liver and gill tissue coincident with the arrival of contaminating oil and up-regulation of cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) protein in gill, liver, intestine, and head kidney for over one year following peak landfall of oil (August 2011) compared to fish collected from reference sites. Furthermore, laboratory exposures of Gulf killifish embryos to field-collected sediments from Grande Terre and Barataria Bay, LA, also resulted in increased CYP1A and developmental abnormalities when exposed to sediments collected from oiled sites compared to exposure to sediments collected from a reference site. These data are predictive of population-level impacts in fish exposed to sediments from oiled locations along the Gulf of Mexico coast.									56	1	0	47	0	58			0013-936X			WOS:000319708600015	23659337

Here we assess whether the adsorption behavior of Pu at concentrations used in typical laboratory studies (>= 10(-10) [Pu] <= 10(-6) M) are representative of adsorption behavior at concentrations measured in natural subsurface waters (generally <10(-12) M). Pu(V) sorption to Na-montmorillonite was examined over a wide range of initial Pu concentrations (10(-8)-10(-18) M). Pu(V) adsorption after 30 days was linear over the wide range of concentrations studied, indicating that Pu sorption behavior from laboratory studies at higher concentrations can be extrapolated to sorption behavior at low, environmentally relevant concentrations. Pu(IV) sorption to montmorillonite was studied at initial concentrations of 10(-6)-10(-11) M and was much faster than Pu(V) sorption over the 30 day equilibration period. However, after one year of equilibration, the extent of Pu(V) adsorption was similar to that observed for Pu(IV) after 30 days. The continued uptake of Pu(V) is attributed to a slow, surface-mediated reduction of Pu(V) to Pu(IV). Comparison between rates of adsorption of Pu(V) to montmorillonite and a range of other minerals (hematite, goethite, magnetite, groutite, corundum, diaspore, and quartz) found that minerals containing significant Fe and Mn (hematite, goethite, magnetite, and groutite) adsorbed Pu(V) faster than those which did not, highlighting the potential importance of minerals with redox couples in increasing the rate of Pu(V) removal from solution.									23	0	0	11	0	23			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000319708600023	23614502

FORMATION OF C-n MOLECULES IN OXYGEN-RICH INTERIORS OF TYPE II SUPERNOVAE								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				769	1					38	10.1088/0004-637X/769/1/38			MAY 20 2013	2013	Two reaction-rate-based kinetic models for condensation of carbon dust via the growth of precursor linear carbon chains are currently under debate: the first involves the formation of C-2 molecules via radiative association of free C atoms, and the second forms C-2 molecules by the endoergic reaction CO + C -> C-2 + O. Both are followed by C captures until the linear chain eventually makes an isomeric transition to ringed carbon on which rapid growth of graphite may occur. These two approaches give vastly different results. Because of the high importance of condensable carbon for current problems in astronomy, we study these competing claims with an intentionally limited reaction rate network which clearly shows that initiation by C + C -> C-2 + gamma is the dominant pathway to carbon rings. We propose an explanation for why the second pathway is not nearly as effective as its proponents calculated it to be.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0004-637X			WOS:000319904500038

We connect these results together by describing a Cartesian tree construction algorithm based on a "bitonicity transform" running in O(n log k) time on a free tree with k leaves, noting that a path is the special case of a tree with just 2 leaves. We also provide a matching worst-case lower bound in the comparison model. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0020-0190			WOS:000317557500007

Here, we explored the DBP formation from chlorination and chloramination of Escherichia coli and found that most selected DBPs were detectable, including trihalomethanes, haloacetonitriles, chloral hydrate, chloropicrin, and 1,1,1-trichloro-2-propanone. A positive correlation (P = 0.08-0.09) between DBP formation and the log reduction of E. coli implied that breaking down of bacterial cells released precursors for DBP formation. As Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a dominant bacterial species in pipeline biofilms, the DBP formation potentials (DBPFPs) from its planktonic cells and biofilms were characterized. Planktonic cells formed 7-11 times greater trihalomethanes per carbon of those from biofilms but significantly lower (P < 0.05) chloral hydrate, highlighting the bacterial phenotype's impact on the bacteria-derived DBPFP. Pipe material appeared to affect the DBPFP of bacteria, with 4-28% lower bromine incorporation factor for biofilms on polyvinyl chloride compared to that on galvanized zinc. This study revealed both the in situ disinfection of bacterial planktonic cells in source water and ex situ reaction between biofilms and residual chlorine in pipeline networks as hitherto unknown DBP sources in drinking water.

The discovery of cis-acting DNA elements that encode these control mechanisms is of high importance. We have investigated the influence of conserved non-coding sequences (CNSs), DNA patterns retained after an ancient whole genome duplication event, on the breadth of gene expression and the rates of mRNA decay in Arabidopsis thaliana. The absence of CNSs near a duplicate genes was associated with a decrease in breadth of gene expression and slower mRNA decay rates while the presence CNSs near a duplicates was associated with an increase in breadth of gene expression and faster mRNA decay rates. The observed difference in mRNA decay rate was fastest in genes with CNSs in both non-transcribed and transcribed regions, albeit through an unknown mechanism. This study supports the notion that some Arabidopsis CNSs regulate the steady-state mRNA levels through post-transcriptional control mechanisms and that CNSs also play a role in controlling the breadth of gene expression.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1664-462X			WOS:000329902800001	23675377

We report here the fabrication of intricate networks of nanostructured tellurium, bismuth telluride, and bismuth-rich compounds with diverse morphologies. The nanostructured networks synthesized via solution-phase techniques consist of nanocrystalline Bi2Te3 with a grain size of about 15-20 nm, 3-5 nm thick rolled-up nanosheets of Te forming tubular structures, nanotubes of Bi2Te3 about 300-400 nm in diameter, Te and Bi4Te3 nanowires ranging from 50 to 200 nm diameter, and microspheres of 3-7 mu m diameter composed of self-assembled BiOCl nanorods. The formation and crystallinity of Bi-rich and Te-rich compounds were investigated using powder X-ray and electron back-scattered diffraction. We present the first detailed analysis of micro-Raman scattering of BixTey nanostructures of above morphologies using six different laser wavelengths. The BixTey nanostructures exhibit the most intense infrared (IR) active A(1u), mode at 120 cm(-1) in the Raman spectra, which disperses with a change in the chemical composition and laser power. In addition, we observe new internal strain-induced peaks in the Raman spectra of BixTey nanostructures. The rich morphologies and compositions present within the nanostructured Bi-Te compounds are expected to result in novel thermoelectric materials.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1932-7447			WOS:000318892000047

Microfluidic Synthesis of Monodisperse Nanoporous Oxide Particles and Control of Hierarchical Pore Structure								ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES				5	9			3524	3529		10.1021/am3030195			MAY 8 2013	2013	Particles with hierarchical porosity can be formed by templating silica microparticles with a specially designed surfactant micelle/oil nanoemulsion mixture. The nanoemulsion oil droplet and micellar dimensions determine the pore size distribution: one set of pores with diameters of tens of nanometers coexisting with a second subset of pores with diameters of single nanometers. Further practical utility of these nanoporous particles requires precise tailoring of the hierarchical pore structure. In this synthesis study, the particle nanostructure is tuned by adjusting the oil, water, and surfactant mixture composition for the controlled design of nanoemulsion-templated features. We also demonstrate control of the size distribution and surface area of the smaller micelle-templated pores as a consequence of altering the hydrophobic chain length of the molecular surfactant template. Moreover, a microfluidic system is designed to process the low interfacial system for fabrication of monodisperse porous particles. The ability to direct the assembly of template nanoemulsion and micelle structures creates new opportunities to engineer hierarchically porous particles for utility as electrocatalysts for fuel cells, chromatography separations, drug delivery vehicles, and other applications.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1944-8244			WOS:000318839100007	23387998

This study was designed to investigate if this reduction in progesterone persisted into old age, and if it did, what mechanisms are involved.Methods: Ewes were fed a nutrient restricted (NR, 50% of NRC recommendations) or control (C, 100% of NRC) diets from day 28 to 78 of gestation, then all were fed to requirements through parturition and weaning. Female offspring (4 per treatment group) were maintained as a group and fed to requirements from weaning until assigned to this study at 6 years of age. Ewes were synchronized for estrus (day 0) and blood samples were collected daily from day 0 to day 11 before necropsy on day 12. Blood serum and luteal tissue were assayed for progesterone concentrations by validated radioimmunoassay.Results: Circulation progesterone concentrations tended to be lower (P = 0.06) in NR than C offspring from day 0 to 11 of the estrous cycle. While total luteal weight was similar across groups, total progesterone content also tended to be reduced (P = 0.07) in luteal tissue of NR than C offspring. Activity of hepatic progesterone catabolizing enzymes and selected angiogenic factors in luteal tissue were similar between groups. Messenger RNA expression of steroidogenic enzymes StAR and P450scc were reduced (P < 0.05), while protein expression of StAR tended to be reduced (P < 0.07) and P450scc was reduced (P < 0.05) in luteal tissue of NR versus C offspring.Conclusions: There appears to be no difference in hepatic steroid catabolism that could have led to the decreased serum progesterone. However, these data are consistent with the programming of decreased steroidogenic enzyme expression in CL of NR offspring, leading to reduced synthesis and secretion of progesterone.									3	0	0	2	0	3			1477-7827			WOS:000319164700001	23656912

As one of the primary risk-drivers and contaminants of concern at nuclear waste repositories, the accurate determination of I-129 in aqueous systems is of significant concern. The redox-active nature of iodine makes its mobility and fate in the environment difficult to predict, thus underscoring the importance of species-specific determination of iodine concentrations. The developed method couples solid phase extraction with liquid scintillation counting, and scintillating anion exchange with a flow-cell detection system for a sequential measurement of each iodine species. Solid phase extraction disks were impregnated with polyvinylpyrrolidone for the selective extraction and stabilization of I-2 with subsequent analysis by liquid scintillation counting. Aqueous I- was concentrated and measured by a previously developed flow-cell system utilizing scintillating anion-exchange resin. A subsequent chemical reduction of IO3- to I- in the effluent was used to quantify IO3- by the same flow-cell system. Nearly quantitative results were found for standardized single-species samples of I-2 (95%), I- (101%), and IO3- (91%), respectively, while consistent measurements were obtained for multispecies samples using the developed method and algorithm.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0003-2700			WOS:000318756100064	23537102

The fibers were fabricated utilizing a molten-core method and exhibited baria (BaO) concentrations up to 18.4 mole %. Physical characteristics such as mass density, acoustic velocity, viscoelastic damping, and refractive index are determined for the baria component of the bariosilicate system. It is found that, of each of these parameters, only the acoustic velocity is less than that of pure silica. The effect of temperature and strain on the acoustic velocity also is determined by utilizing estimates of the strain-and thermo-optic coefficients. The dependencies are found to have signs opposite to those of silica, thus suggesting both Brillouin-frequency a-thermal and a-tensic binary compositions. Via the estimate of the strain-optic coefficient and data found in the literature, the Pockels' photoelastic constant p(12) is estimated, and both a calculation and measured estimate of the Brillouin gain versus baria content are presented. Such novel fibers incorporating the unique properties of baria could be of great utility for narrow linewidth fiber lasers, high power passive components (such as couplers and combiners), and Brillouin-based sensor systems.

Solution-cast PAN copolymer samples were irradiated for different durations (100, 300, and 600 s) and temperatures (approximate to 65 and 100 degrees C, below and above glass transition temperature respectively). FTIR spectra show the formation of carbonoxygen, carbonnitrogen, and carboncarbon double bonds (14501700 cm1 region) attributed to the development of cyclized structure. Conversion indices estimated from the FTIR spectra indicate samples containing hydrogen abstraction photoinitiator show higher extents of cyclization among the three main set of samples. This observation was also confirmed by higher gel percentages measured on the same set of samples. FTIR conversion indices of samples UV-treated above glass transition temperature were higher compared with that for the same specimens UV-treated below glass transition temperature. DSC results show that samples containing hydrogen abstraction photoinitiator enable a higher extent of post-UV thermal cyclization. FTIR spectra of the UV treated samples were compared with conventional thermal stabilized specimens. This comparison confirms that the addition of 1 wt % photoinitiator to PAN followed by 5 min of UV treatment increases the rate of the cyclization reaction and reduces the thermal oxidation time by over an hour, which could significantly reduce the conventional stabilization time by half. These results indicate the potential for an energy-efficient, cost-effective route for producing carbon fibers. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

There remains a question as to how accurately the stress-energy method can predict deceleration values and whether it is statistically comparable to the method described in ASTM D1596. There are three phases to this research that attempt to determine the accuracy of the stress-energy method: gathering data using the stress-energy method and analyzing the goodness of fit of the stress-energy equation, predicting a cushion curve and observing the upper and lower bounds for a given drop height and thickness, and using ASTM D1596 to create a cushion curve with the same drop height and thickness and comparing it to the predicted cushion curve. Analyzing ten stress-energy data sets using the root mean square error in addition to the coefficient of determination provided a more thorough goodness of fit analysis. Utilizing the stress-energy method to predict cushion curves produced minimal errors and similar decelerations when compared to six actual cushion curve data sets.									1	1	0	0	0	2			0090-3973			WOS:000318465000008

The venous and arterial connections of a total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC) test section were coupled with a physical lumped parameter (LP) model of the circulation. Intrathoracic and subdiaphragmatic pressure changes associated with normal breathing were applied. This system was tuned for two patients (5 years, 0.67 m(2); 10 years, 1.2 m(2)) to physiological values. System function was verified by comparison to the analytical model on which it was based and by consistency with published clinical measurements. Overall, subdiaphragmatic venous flow was influenced by respiration. Flow within the arteries and veins increased during inspiration but decreased during expiration, with retrograde flow in the inferior venous territories. System pressures and flows showed close agreement with the analytical LP model (p < 0.05). The ratio of the flow rates occurring during inspiration to expiration were within the clinical range of values reported elsewhere. The approach used to set up and control the model was effective and provided reasonable comparisons with clinical data.									9	0	0	1	0	9			1058-2916	1538-943X		WOS:000330472400010	23644612

Glutaraldehyde does not stabilize glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and they are lost during preparation, in vivo implantation, cyclic fatigue, and storage. We report that binding of neomycin, a hyaluronidase inhibitor, to the tissues with carbodiimide cross-linking improves GAG retention without reducing collagen and elastin stability. It also led to improved biomechanical properties. Neomycin carbodiimide cross-linking did not significantly reduce calcification in a rat subdermal implantation model when they were stored in formaldehyde after cross-linking. Removal of formaldehyde storage significantly reduced calcification.									4	0	0	3	0	4			0885-3282	1530-8022		WOS:000330324300003	22207605

Pharyngeal Odontoma in an Adult Walleye (Sander vitreus)								VETERINARY PATHOLOGY				50	3			483	487		10.1177/0300985812446149			MAY 2013	2013	An adult walleye (Sander vitreus) was submitted to Cornell University for evaluation of a hard pale-tan pharyngeal mass attached to the gill arches. Dozens of hard white conical structures radiated from the surface. Microscopically, conical structures were identified as denticles and rested on plates of dysplastic orthodentine, cementum, and acellular bone. A diagnosis of compound odontoma was made based upon the presence of proliferative epithelial and mesenchymal odontogenic tissues that recapitulated tooth structures normally present on gill rakers. Odontomas are classified as hamartomas and typically develop in immature diphyodont mammals. The pharyngeal location and lifelong regeneration of teeth in fish, however, both qualify the present diagnosis in the pharyngeal region of an adult teleost. Ontogenic and morphologic differences between mammalian and piscine dentition and differentials for tooth-bearing tumors in fish are presented within the context of a developmental anomaly.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0300-9858	1544-2217		WOS:000330298600018	22610032

Extension of a Current Continuum-Level Material Model for Soil into the Low-Density Discrete-Particle Regime								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				22	5			1268	1283		10.1007/s11665-012-0429-3			MAY 2013	2013	In this article, an attempt is made to construct a soil-material model which can be used over a wide range of soil densities. To construct such a model, an existing purely continuum-type soil material model (used in the high-density regime), within which the granular structure of the soil is neglected, is combined with an existing discrete-type soil material model (used in the low-density regime) within which soil is treated as an assembly of interacting particles. In order to enable it to be used in conventional transient, nonlinear dynamics, and finite element analyses, the new soil material model is cast using a continuum-type framework. Thus, while in the low-density regime soil behavior is fully dominated by the discrete-type soil-material model, soil has been treated as a continuum constituent properties of which are governed by particle geometrical parameters and particle-particle interaction laws. To demonstrate the utility and fidelity of the new soil material model, a series of uniaxial strain computational tests involving rectangular, parallelepiped-shaped soil-slug normal impact onto a rigid, fixed, flat surface is carried out. While these tests are of a one-dimensional character, they are generally considered as being representative of the loading and deformation histories experienced by mine-blast-ejected soil during its impact with the target structure. The results obtained using the newly proposed soil material model, in the low-density regime, are found to be fully consistent with their discrete-particle modeling and simulation counterparts, suggesting that the new model can be used in transient nonlinear dynamics, finite element simulations involving low-density soil.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1059-9495			WOS:000317652800006

Commercial fuels can differ considerably in composition and autoignition chemistry; hence, strategies intended to bring HCCI to market must account for this fuel variability. To this end, a test matrix consisting of eight gasoline fuels comprised of blends made solely from refinery streams were run in an experimental, single cylinder HCCI engine. All fuels contained 10% ethanol by volume and were representative of a cross section of fuels one would expect to find at gasoline pumps across the United States. The properties of the fuels were varied according to research octane number (RON), sensitivity (S - RON-MON), and volumetric content of aromatics and olefins. For each fuel, a sweep of load (mass of fuel injected per cycle) was conducted and the intake air temperature was adjusted in order to keep the crank angle of the 50% mass fraction burned point (CA50) constant. By analyzing the amount of temperature compensation required to maintain constant combustion phasing, it was possible to determine the sensitivity of HCCI to changes in load for various fuels. In addition, the deviation of fuel properties brought about variations in important engine performance metrics like specific fuel consumption. Though the injected energy content per cycle was matched at the baseline point across the test fuel matrix, thermodynamic differences resulted in a spread of specific fuel consumption for the fuels tested.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0742-4795	1528-8919		WOS:000326154200015

Concentric compound nozzle-based jetting has been favored due to its efficiency and precise control of the core-shell compound structure. Thus far, little is known about the underlying formation mechanism of double-layered microcapsules in compound nozzle jetting. This study aims to understand the formability of double-layered microcapsules in compound nozzle jetting by combining a theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. A linear temporal instability analysis is used to define the perturbation growth rates of stretching and squeezing modes and a growth ratio as a function of the wave number, and a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method is implemented to model the microcapsule formation process in order to determine the good microcapsule forming range based on the growth ratio curve. Using a pseudobisection method, the lower and upper bounds of the good formability range have been determined for a given materials-nozzle system. The proposed formability prediction methodology has been implemented to model a water-poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA)-air compound jetting system.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0098-2202	1528-901X		WOS:000326102400008

Due to heart-muscle complexity, progress in the development of knowledge concerning the role of MSCs in cardiac repair is heavily based on MSC-cardiomyocyte coculture. In conventional coculture systems, however, the in vivo cardiac muscle structure, in which rod-shaped cells are connected end-to-end, is not sustained; instead, irregularly shaped cells spread randomly, resulting in randomly distributed cell junctions. Consequently, contact-mediated cell-cell interactions (e.g., the electrical triggering signal and the mechanical contraction wave that propagate through MSC-cardiomyocyte junctions) occur randomly. Thus, the data generated on the beneficial effects of MSCs may be irrelevant to in vivo biological processes. In this study, we explored whether cardiomyocyte alignment, the most important phenotype, is relevant to stem cell cardiogenic differentiation. Here, we report (i) the construction of a laser-patterned, biochip-based, stem cell-cardiomyocyte coculture model with controlled cell alignment; and (ii) single-cell-level data on stem cell cardiogenic differentiation under in vivo-like cardiomyocyte alignment conditions.									15	5	0	4	0	18			2047-7538			WOS:000324468600002

The system under study embodies internetworking concepts requiring independent wireless networks to cooperate in order to provide a unified network to users. We propose a multi-attribute scheduling algorithm implemented by a central Global Resource Controller (GRC) that manages the resources of several different autonomous wireless systems. The attributes considered by the multi-attribute optimization function consist of system spectral efficiency, battery lifetime of each user (or overall energy consumption), and instantaneous and long-term fairness for each user in the system. To compute the relative importance of each attribute, we use the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) that takes interview responses from wireless network providers as input and generates weight assignments for each attribute in our optimization problem. Through Matlab/CPLEX based simulations, we show an increase in a multi-attribute system utility measure of up to 57% for our algorithm compared to other widely studied resource allocation algorithms including Max-Sum Rate, Proportional Fair, Max-Min Fair and Min Power.									11	1	0	0	0	12			0733-8716			WOS:000318164300015

In this paper, we investigate a path to democracy that is very different from that typically described. During the Archaic period (800-500 BCE), many Greek poleis (city-states) replaced aristocracies with a more narrow governing institution-an autocrat known as the tyrant. Yet as classical scholars have noted, many of the poleis where tyrants reigned in the Archaic period became among the broadest democracies in the subsequent Classical period (500-323 BCE). We analyze a data set of ancient Greek political regime types and review the history of the best-known Archaic period tyrants in order to explore why a transitory narrowing of power-Greek tyranny was a transitory institution-can set the stage for democratization. We briefly consider other historical and modern examples. Our paper shows why an understanding of progress toward democracy requires recognizing the potential importance of nonmonotonic transition paths.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0022-2186	1537-5285		WOS:000321893300005

This review focuses on changes in pK and protonation states of ionizable groups that accompany protein-ligand binding. Physical origins of these effects are outlined, followed by a brief overview of the computational methods to predict them and the associated corrections to receptor-ligand binding affinities. Statistical prevalence, magnitude and spatial distribution of the pK and protonation state changes in protein-ligand binding are discussed in detail, based on both experimental and theoretical studies. While there is no doubt that these changes occur, they do not occur all the time; the estimated prevalence varies, both between individual complexes and by method. The changes occur not only in the immediate vicinity of the interface but also sometimes far away. When receptor-ligand binding is associated with protonation state change at particular pH, the binding becomes pH dependent: we review the interplay between sub-cellular characteristic pH and optimum pH of receptor-ligand binding. It is pointed out that there is a tendency for protonation state changes upon binding to be minimal at physiologically relevant pH for each complex (no net proton uptake/release), suggesting that native receptor-ligand interactions have evolved to reduce the energy cost associated with ionization changes. As a result, previously reported statistical prevalence of these changes - typically computed at the same pH for all complexes - may be higher than what may be expected at optimum pH specific to each complex. We also discuss whether proper account of protonation state changes appears to improve practical docking and scoring outcomes relevant to structure-based drug design. An overview of some of the existing challenges in the field is provided in conclusion.									24	0	0	12	0	24			0033-5835	1469-8994		WOS:000322398500002	23889892

During reprocessing TBP degrades to dibutyl phosphate (DBP), butyl acid phosphate (MBP), butanol, and phosphoric acid over time. A method for rapidly monitoring TBP degradation is needed for the support of nuclear forensics. Therefore, a Fourier transform infrared spectrometry-attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR) technique was developed to determine approximate peak intensity ratios of TBP and its degradation products. The technique was developed by combining variable concentrations of TBP, DBP, and MBP to simulate TBP degradation. This method is achieved by analyzing selected peak positions and peak intensity ratios of TBP and DBP at different stages of degradation. The developed technique was tested on TBP samples degraded with nitric acid. In mock degradation samples, the 1,235 cm(-1) peak position shifts to 1,220 cm(-1) as the concentration of TBP decreases and DBP increases. Peak intensity ratios of TBP positions at 1,279 and 1,020 cm(-1) relative to DBP positions at 909 and 1,003 cm(-1) demonstrate an increasing trend as the concentration of DBP increases. The same peak intensity ratios were used to analyze DBP relative to MBP whereas a decreasing trend is seen with increasing DBP concentrations. The technique developed from this study may be used as a tool to determine TBP degradation in nuclear reprocessing via a rapid FTIR-ATR measurement without gas chromatography analysis.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0236-5731			WOS:000320282800045

This Open Time Key program, known as GASPS (Gas Survey of Protoplanetary Systems), targeted similar to 250 young stars in narrow wavelength regions covering the [OI] fine structure line at 63 mu m the brightest far-infrared line in such objects. A subset of the brightest targets were also surveyed in [OI]145 mu m, [CII] at 157 mu m, as well as several transitions of H2O and high-excitation CO lines at selected wavelengths between 78 and 180 mu m. Additionally, GASPS included continuum photometry at 70, 100 and 160 mu m, around the peak of the dust emission. The targets were SED Class II-III T Tauri stars and debris disks from seven nearby young associations, along with a comparable sample of isolated Herbig AeBe stars. The aim was to study the global gas and dust content in a wide sample of circumstellar disks, combining the results with models in a systematic way. In this overview paper we review the scientific aims, target selection and observing strategy of the program. We summarise some of the initial results, showing line identifications, listing the detections, and giving a first statistical study of line detectability. The [OI] line at 63 mu m was the brightest line seen in almost all objects, by a factor of similar to 10. Overall [OI]63 mu m detection rates were 49%, with 100% of HAeBe stars and 43% of T Tauri stars detected. A comparison with published disk dust masses (derived mainly from sub-mm continuum, assuming standard values of the mm mass opacity) shows a dust mass threshold for [OI] 63 mu m detection of similar to 10(-5) M-circle dot. Normalising to a distance of 140 pc, 84% of objects with dust masses >= 10(-5) M-circle dot can be detected in this line in the present survey; 32% of those of mass 10(-6)-10(-5) M-circle dot, and only a very small number of unusual objects with lower masses can be detected. This is consistent with models with a moderate UV excess and disk flaring. For a given disk mass, [OI] detectability is lower for M stars compared with earlier spectral types. Both the continuum and line emission was, in most systems, spatially and spectrally unresolved and centred on the star, suggesting that emission in most cases was from the disk. Approximately 10 objects showed resolved emission, most likely from outflows. In the GASPS sample, [OI] detection rates in T Tauri associations in the 0.3-4 Myr age range were similar to 50%. For each association in the 5-20 Myr age range, similar to 2 stars remain detectable in [OI]63 mu m, and no systems were detected in associations with age >20 Myr. Comparing with the total number of young stars in each association, and assuming a ISM-like gas/dust ratio, this indicates that similar to 18% of stars retain a gas-rich disk of total mass similar to 1 M-Jupiter for 1-4 Myr, 1-7% keep such disks for 5-10 Myr, but none are detected beyond 10-20 Myr. The brightest [OI] objects from GASPS were also observed in [OI]145 mu m, [CII]157 mu m and CO J = 18 - 17, with detection rates of 20-40%. Detection of the [CII] line was not correlated with disk mass, suggesting it arises more commonly from a compact remnant envelope.									40	0	0	1	0	41			0004-6280			WOS:000320241800001

We tested three acclimation temperatures (12,18,and 24 degrees C),and three LW temperature differentials (T = -4,0,and +4 degrees C) were tested at each acclimation temperature. Survival was monitored after 8h of LW confinement and during a 5-d retention period in 1,700-L tanks. None of the Walleyes that were acclimated to 24 degrees C and subjected to simulated tournament procedures survived the 5-d retention period; for fish subjected only to simulated angling at 24 degrees C,survival during the 5-d retention period was 29%. Five-day survival was generally over 70% at acclimation temperatures of 12 degrees C and 18 degrees C,and we observed a significant interaction between acclimation temperature and T; survival was greatest in LWs at -4 degrees C T for fish acclimated to 18 degrees C and in LWs at +4 degrees C T for fish acclimated to 12 degrees C. Best survival of Walleyes subjected to the stress of angling and tournament procedures was obtained at temperatures 6-8 degrees C below the optimum temperature for adult Walleyes (i.e.,optimum = 20-22 degrees C). Five-day survival exceeded 70% when LW DO was 5 or 12-15mg/L (at an acclimation and LW temperature of 18 degrees C),but survival was 0% when DO was 2mg/L. Anglers may increase survival of Walleyes through careful manipulation of LW temperature and DO when ambient temperature is at or below 18 degrees C,but high mortality of angled and LW-retained Walleyes should be expected when ambient water temperatures are 24 degrees C or greater.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0002-8487			WOS:000320642200026

The general characteristics and release behavior of microcapsules, and their repellent effect against insects were investigated. The morphology of microcapsules using SLS was spherical shape with smooth surface. Microcapsules began to degrade at 150 degrees C. The particle size ranged from 1 to 10 mu m and the loading efficiency of thyme oil was clearly affected by the emulsifier type. The highest loading efficiency appeared in microcapsules using SLS, which have good thermal resistance and smooth surface. The release rate of thyme oil from microcapsules was not only dependent on the storage temperature but also emulsifier type and microcapsules showed the sustained release properties for a long time. Diets, which were mixed with encapsulated thyme oil, expressed high insect repellent efficacy over 90% for 4 wk.									11	0	0	6	0	11			0022-1147	1750-3841		WOS:000320612500010	23551154

The ACS Exams Institute conducted a needs assessment survey of 1500 chemistry faculty members from across the country to investigate motivation, role, instrument use, and challenges associated with assessment efforts. For the more than 70% of participants who reported departmental efforts related to assessment, these findings emerged: motivations were primarily external factors related to accreditation and certification, ACS Exams and in-house exams were the most common instruments used, and time management associated with grading and reporting assessment results was the most frequently cited challenge. Summary results for each survey question related to these aspects of departmental assessment efforts are provided, along with logistic regression analyses of responses based on institution type. Logistic regression analyses were also used to identify differences among sex, years teaching, and chemistry subdiscipline for responses to departmental assessment efforts and instrument use.									14	0	0	0	0	14			0021-9584			WOS:000319709600007		
J	Krishna, Vibhor; Konakondla, Sanjay; Nicholas, Joyce; Varma, Abhay; Kindy, Mark; Wen, Xuejun								Biomaterial-based interventions for neuronal regeneration and functional recovery in rodent model of spinal cord injury: A systematic review								JOURNAL OF SPINAL CORD MEDICINE				36	3			174	190		10.1179/2045772313Y.0000000095			MAY 2013	2013	Context: There is considerable interest in translating laboratory advances in neuronal regeneration following spinal cord injury (SCI). A multimodality approach has been advocated for successful functional neuronal regeneration. With this goal in mind several biomaterials have been employed as neuronal bridges either to support cellular transplants, to release neurotrophic factors, or to do both. A systematic review of this literature is lacking. Such a review may provide insight to strategies with a high potential for further investigation and potential clinical application.Objective: To systematically review the design strategies and outcomes after biomaterial-based multimodal interventions for neuronal regeneration in rodent SCI model. To analyse functional outcomes after implantation of biomaterial- based multimodal interventions and to identify predictors of functional outcomes.Methods: A broad PubMed, CINHAL, and a manual search of relevant literature databases yielded data from 24 publications; 14 of these articles included functional outcome information. Studies reporting behavioral data in rat model of SCI and employing biodegradable polymer-based multimodal intervention were included. For behavioral recovery, studies using severe injury models (transection or severe clip compression (>16.9 g) or contusion (50 g/cm)) were categorized separately from those investigating partial injury models (hemisection or moderate-to-severe clip compression or contusion).Results: The cumulative mean improvements in Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scores after biomaterial- based interventions are 5.93 (95% CI = 2.41 - 9.45) and 4.44 (95% CI = 2.65 - 6.24) for transection and hemisection models, respectively. Factors associated with improved outcomes include the type of polymer used and a follow- up period greater than 6 weeks.Conclusion: The functional improvement after implantation of biopolymer- based multimodal implants is modest. The relationship with neuronal regeneration and functional outcome, the effects of inflammation at the site of injury, the prolonged survival of supporting cells, the differentiation of stem cells, the effective delivery of neurotrophic factors, and longer follow- up periods are all topics for future elucidation. Future investigations should strive to further define specific factors associated with improved functional outcomes in clinically relevant models.									9	2	0	6	1	12			1079-0268	2045-7723		WOS:000319500100002	23809587

A variety of water samples, representing a landscape gradient and different types of FDOM, were analyzed for their percentage distribution of five operationally defined FDOM fractions (aromatic protein I, aromatic protein II, fulvic acid-like, soluble microbial byproduct-like, and humic acid-like) using three numerical methods in integrating volume under the surface of the fluorescence EEMs: Riemann summation, composite trapezoidal rule, and composite Simpson's rule. The influence of wavelength increment was also examined for the precision of the percentage distribution of each fraction. Our results show that the FDOM fraction estimated by Riemann summation with a 10- or 5-nm excitation wavelength can cause >40% or >5% errors, respectively, when compared with the best estimated values obtained by averaging results from composite trapezoidal rule and composite Simpson's rule with 1-nm excitation wavelength at the same emission increment. Also, our experiments show that fluorescence matrix regional integration could underestimate the two aromatic protein fractions but could overestimate the soluble microbial byproduct-like and humic acid-like fractions if improper increment and integral methods are used. The error can be reduced if a smaller wavelength increment is used. The smallest increment in a spectrofluorometer and composite Simpson's rule should be used for scanning fluorescence EEMs and calculating the percentage distribution of each FDOM fraction. Alternatively, 5-nm wavelength increments with composite Simpson's rule could be cost effective, and the error of each FDOM fraction commonly falls within 5% compared with those estimated by 1-nm increments.									16	2	0	14	0	18			0047-2425			WOS:000318213000034	23673961

BIOMACROMOLECULES				14	5			1257	1261		10.1021/bm400290u			MAY 2013	2013	These studies illustrate synthetic paths to covalently attach T1 and Phi 11 bacteriophages (phages) to inert polymeric surfaces while maintaining the bacteriophage's biological activities capable of killing deadly human pathogens. The first step involved the formation of acid (COOH) groups on polyethylene (PE) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) surfaces using microwave plasma reactions in the presence of maleic anhydride, followed by covalent attachment of T1 and Phi 11 species via primary amine groups. The phages effectively retain their biological activity manifested by a rapid infection with their own DNA and effective destruction of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus human pathogens. These studies show that simultaneous covalent attachment of two biologically active phages effectively destroy both bacterial colonies and eliminate biofilm formation, thus offering an opportunity for an effective combat against multibacterial colonies as well as surface detections of other pathogens.									8	0	0	2	0	8			1525-7797			WOS:000319034600002	23590700

Approximation of coupled Stokes-Darcy flow in an axisymmetric domain								COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING				258				96	108		10.1016/j.cma2013.02.004			MAY 1 2013	2013	In this article we investigate the numerical approximation of coupled Stokes and Darcy fluid flow equations in an axisymmetric domain. The fluid flow is assumed to be axisymmetric. Rewriting the problem in cylindrical coordinates reduces the 3-D problem to a problem in 2-D. This reduction to 2-D requires the numerical analysis to be studied in suitably weighted Hilbert spaces. In this setting we show that the proposed approximation scheme has a unique solution, and derive corresponding a priori error estimate. Computations for an example with a know solution are presented which support the a priori error estimate. Computations are also given for a model of fluid flow in the eye. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The influence of PANI chemical structure formed under various polymerization conditions on the sensor response was investigated. The presence of aniline dimer derivatives in PANI structure was found to induce significant improvement of the limit of detection and the linear dynamic range without a change in sensitivity. The sensor prepared by aniline polymerization in pH7 buffer leading to the product containing mainly the aniline dimer-based units showed the best detection limit of 0.1 mu M. It was shown that the PANI-based sensor could be used for ascorbic acid analysis in the presence of citrate and lactate as interfering ions. A quantitative determination of ascorbic acid concentration in beverages and vitamins was performed.									11	1	0	3	0	11			1040-0397			WOS:000318798000031

Participants: The sample included 424 males recruited as freshmen from a large state university in the southeastern United States. Methods: Respondents completed survey measures in their first, second, and third years of enrollment at the university. Results: Path analyses revealed that the prospective effect of fraternity membership on sexual aggression was mediated by high-risk alcohol use. Conclusions: The findings indicate that high-risk alcohol use accounts for much of the association between fraternity membership and sexual aggression.									6	0	0	1	0	6			0744-8481			WOS:000318775700004	23663125

Computational Modeling of Microstructural-Evolution in AISI 1005 Steel During Gas Metal Arc Butt Welding								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				22	5			1209	1222		10.1007/s11665-012-0402-1			MAY 2013	2013	A fully coupled (two-way), transient, thermal-mechanical finite-element procedure is developed to model conventional gas metal arc welding (GMAW) butt-joining process. Two-way thermal-mechanical coupling is achieved by making the mechanical material model of the workpiece and the weld temperature-dependent and by allowing the potential work of plastic deformation resulting from large thermal gradients to be dissipated in the form of heat. To account for the heat losses from the weld into the surroundings, heat transfer effects associated with natural convection and radiation to the environment and thermal-heat conduction to the adjacent workpiece material are considered. The procedure is next combined with the basic physical-metallurgy concepts and principles and applied to a prototypical (plain) low-carbon steel (AISI 1005) to predict the distribution of various crystalline phases within the as-welded material microstructure in different fusion zone and heat-affected zone locations, under given GMAW-process parameters. The results obtained are compared with available open-literature experimental data to provide validation/verification for the proposed GMAW modeling effort.									8	0	0	0	0	8			1059-9495	1544-1024		WOS:000317652800001

The fabrication of these ceramics, however, requires ultrafine and uniform powders as precursors. Presented here is the synthesis of Er-doped Lu2O3 nanopowders by a solution precipitation method using Er-doped lutetium sulfate solution and hexamethylenetetramine as a precipitant and the fabrication of Er-doped Lu2O3 transparent ceramics from these nanopowders. The precipitated precursors were calcined at 1100 degrees C for 4 h in order to convert the precursors into Lu2O3 nanoparticles with an average particle size of 60 nm. Thermal decomposition and phase evolution of the precursors were studied by simultaneous thermal analysis (STA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Er-doped Lu2O3 transparent ceramics were fabricated from these nanopowders using vacuum sintering followed by hot isostatic pressing at 1700 degrees C for 8 h. The transparent ceramics exhibit an optical transmittance of 78% at a wavelength of 1.55 mu n. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Wavenumber and symmetry assignments are given for all expected 21 Raman active optical branches, except one LO component (out of the eight expected TOLO pairs) of the polar doublet E modes. Also, the four expected hyper-Raman active A2 (TO) modes have been observed. Moreover, we have observed a strong Kleinman-disallowed hyper-Rayleigh signal, which is tentatively assigned as a first evidence of hyper-Rayleigh optical activity.

Sumoylation modulates protein stability, subcellular localization and activity; thus, it regulates most cellular functions including response to environmental stress in plants. To study the feasibility of manipulating SUMO E3 ligase, one of the important components in the sumoylation pathway in transgenic (TG) crop plants for improving overall plant performance under adverse environmental conditions, we have analysed TG creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) plants constitutively expressing OsSIZ1, a rice SUMO E3 ligase. Overexpression of OsSIZ1 led to increased photosynthesis and overall plant growth. When subjected to water deficiency and heat stress, OsSIZ1 plants exhibited drastically enhanced performance associated with more robust root growth, higher water retention and cell membrane integrity than wild-type (WT) controls. OsSIZ1 plants also displayed significantly better growth than WT controls under phosphate-starvation conditions, which was associated with a higher uptake of phosphate (Pi) and other minerals, such as potassium and zinc. Further analysis revealed that overexpression of OsSIZ1 enhanced stress-induced SUMO conjugation to substrate in TG plants, which was associated with modified expression of stress-related genes. This strongly supports a role sumoylation plays in regulating multiple molecular pathways involved in plant stress response, establishing a direct link between sumoylation and plant response to environmental adversities. Our results demonstrate the great potential of genetic manipulation of sumoylation process in TG crop species for improved resistance to broad abiotic stresses.									17	0	0	16	0	18			1467-7644			WOS:000318423400004	23231430	
J	Weisensee, Katherine E.								Assessing the relationship between fluctuating asymmetry and cause of death in skeletal remains: A test of the developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN BIOLOGY				25	3			411	417		10.1002/ajhb.22390			MAY-JUN 2013	2013	Objectives This study examines the relationship between craniofacial fluctuating asymmetry and cause of death in an identified skeletal collection. This study tests the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease hypothesis using fluctuating asymmetry as the measure of developmental instability. Methods The skeletal sample used in this study comes from Lisbon, Portugal, and individuals in the sample were born between 1806 and 1935. This represents a period during which Lisbon was beginning to undergo the modern health transition, in which mortality from infectious disease began to decline while mortality from degenerative diseases began to increase. Approximately equal numbers of individuals in the sample died from infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, and from degenerative diseases. Fluctuating asymmetry is examined using three-dimensional landmark data collected from 392 individuals with documented causes of death. Landmark data may provide a more robust measure of fluctuating asymmetry, although it has not often been used in studies of fluctuating asymmetry in human skeletal samples. Results The results of the study show that individuals who died from degenerative diseases have higher rates of fluctuating asymmetry compared to individuals who died from infectious diseases. Males also exhibit higher rates of fluctuating asymmetry compared to females. Conclusions The results of this study confirm earlier findings that early development has a significant impact on adult health outcomes. Furthermore, the results suggest that fluctuating asymmetry in skeletal samples may offer a means of testing the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease hypothesis. Am. J. Hum.

Periodicity in Stem Growth and Litterfall in Tidal Freshwater Forested Wetlands: Influence of Salinity and Drought on Nitrogen Recycling								ESTUARIES AND COASTS				36	3			533	546		10.1007/s12237-012-9505-z			MAY 2013	2013	Many tidally influenced freshwater forested wetlands (tidal swamps) along the south Atlantic coast of the USA are currently undergoing dieback and decline. Salinity often drives conversion of tidal swamps to marsh, especially under conditions of regional drought. During this change, alterations in nitrogen (N) uptake from dominant vegetation or timing of N recycling from the canopy during annual litter senescence may help to facilitate marsh encroachment by providing for greater bioavailable N with small increases in salinity. To monitor these changes along with shifts in stand productivity, we established sites along two tidal swamp landscape transects on the lower reaches of the Waccamaw River (South Carolina) and Savannah River (Georgia) representing freshwater (a parts per thousand currency sign0.1 psu), low oligohaline (1.1-1.6 psu), and high oligohaline (2.6-4.1 psu) stands; the latter stands have active marsh encroachment. Aboveground tree productivity was monitored on all sites through monthly litterfall collection and dendrometer band measurements from 2005 to 2009. Litterfall samples were pooled by season and analyzed for total N and carbon (C). On average between the two rivers, freshwater, low oligohaline, and high oligohaline tidal swamps returned 8,126, 3,831, and 1,471 mg N m(-2) year(-1), respectively, to the forest floor through litterfall, with differences related to total litterfall volume rather than foliar N concentrations. High oligohaline sites were most inconsistent in patterns of foliar N concentrations and N loading from the canopy. Leaf N content generally decreased and foliar C/N generally increased with salinization (excepting one site), with all sites being fairly inefficient in resorbing N from leaves prior to senescence. Stands with higher salinity also had greater flood frequency and duration, lower basal area increments, lower tree densities, higher numbers of dead or dying trees, and much reduced leaf litter fall (103 vs. 624 g m(-2) year(-1)) over the five study years. Our data suggest that alternative processes, such as the rate of decomposition and potential for N mineralization, on tidal swamp sites undergoing salinity-induced state change may be more important for controlling N biogeochemical cycling in soils than differences among sites in N loading via litterfall.									12	0	0	10	0	12			1559-2723			WOS:000318295300008

The role of intrinsic motivation for utilitarian systems								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS				22	3			360	380		10.1057/ejis.2012.25			MAY 2013	2013	Since the introduction of the Motivational Technology Acceptance Model in 1992, many researchers have considered both extrinsic and intrinsic motivation as antecedents of intent to use and actual use of a system. However, it has been a long-standing and largely unchallenged assumption that intrinsic motivation (i.e., fun or enjoyment) is a more dominant predictor of hedonic (fun) application use and that extrinsic motivation (i.e., usefulness) is a more dominant predictor of utilitarian (practical) application use. In this article, we probe whether system type serves as a boundary condition (i.e., moderator) for understanding an individual's interaction with information technology. Specifically, we examine whether perceived enjoyment's influence on perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, intention, and use varies with system type. On the basis of a meta-analytic structural equation modeling analysis of 185 studies between 1992 and February 2011, our findings suggest intrinsic motivation is equally relevant for predicting intentions toward using and actual use of both hedonic and utilitarian systems. Therefore, our meta-analytic results call into question the rigidity of the assumption that system type is a 'boundary condition' for understanding individuals' interaction with information technology. The implications of these results for research and practice are discussed.									14	0	0	0	1	14			0960-085X			WOS:000317572500007

We simulate how consumer behavior responds to house price and income declines as well as tightening credit. In response to a negative home price shock, households early in the life cycle climb the housing ladder more quickly and invest more in housing assets due to the lower price. With a concurrent negative income shock, however, housing demand falls among young and middle aged households who stay in smaller homes rather than to trade up.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0020-6598			WOS:000317986200001

Despite the large and growing body of evidence pointing to the need to restore biodiversity to farm systems, incorporation of biodiversity and ecosystem services into local agricultural land-use decision-making remains limited. The lack of planned and associated biodiversity may reduce resiliency of local managed ecosystems and add management costs; however, the tradeoff for individual landowners of greater diversity is increased management complexity and uncertainty. To assist farmers in managing biodiversity and to encourage ecological thinking, we developed the Healthy Farm Index, a farm-scale tool that complements existing farm assessment tools by integrating multiple metrics and outputs suitable for applied decision-making and annual evaluation. In this article, we describe the impetus for the index development and the structure of the index and through a case study apply the index and discuss its varied outputs and applications.									3	0	0	2	0	3			1473-5903			WOS:000317893600006

In this study, the effects on DPPH inhibition of egg-white protein polypeptides ranging from 10 to 30 kDa treated by pulsed electric field (PEF) technology were investigated. RESULTS 2, 2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) inhibition (%) was used to evaluate the antioxidant activity of polypeptides. In order to develop and optimize a pulsed electric field (PEF) mathematical model for improving the antioxidant activity, we have investigated three variables, including concentration (6, 8 and 10 mg mL1), electric field intensity (10, 20 and 30 kV cm1) and pulse frequency (2000, 2350 and 2700 Hz) and subsequently optimized them by response surface methodology (RSM). The concentration (8 mg mL1), electric field intensity (10 kV cm1) and pulse frequency (2000 Hz) were found to be the optimal conditions under which the DPPH inhibition increased 28.44%, compared to the sample without PEF treatment. Both near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) and mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR) were used to analyze the change of functional groups (c) 2012 Society of Chemical Industry. CONCLUSION The results showed that PEF technology could improve the antioxidant activity of antioxidant polypeptides from egg-white protein under the optimized conditions.									7	0	0	6	0	7			0022-5142			WOS:000317614000016	23150498

Peach, a diploid Prunus species, is one of the best genetically characterized deciduous trees. Here we describe the high-quality genome sequence of peach obtained from a completely homozygous genotype. We obtained a complete chromosome-scale assembly using Sanger whole-genome shotgun methods. We predicted 27,852 protein-coding genes, as well as noncoding RNAs. We investigated the path of peach domestication through whole-genome resequencing of 14 Prunus accessions. The analyses suggest major genetic bottlenecks that have substantially shaped peach genome diversity. Furthermore, comparative analyses showed that peach has not undergone recent whole-genome duplication, and even though the ancestral triplicated blocks in peach are fragmentary compared to those in grape, all seven paleosets of paralogs from the putative paleoancestor are detectable.									266	13	0	245	3	279			1061-4036			WOS:000318158200009

Characterization of Monilinia fructicola Strains Resistant to Both Propiconazole and Boscalid								PLANT DISEASE				97	5			645	651		10.1094/PDIS-10-12-0924-RE			MAY 2013	2013	Chen, F., Liu, X., Chen, S., Schnabel, E., and Schnabel, G. 2013. Characterization of Monilinia fructicola strains resistant to both propiconazole and boscalid. Plant Dis. 97:645-651. In 2011 and 2012, significant brown rot disease caused by Monilinia fructicola was observed in a peach orchard in Spartanburg County, SC, despite preharvest fungicide applications of demethylation inhibitor (DMI), quinone outside inhibitor (QoI), and succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHI) fungicides. All 22 isolates obtained in 2011 from this orchard were sensitive to the QoI fungicide, azoxystrobin, and the methyl benzimidazole carbamate (MBC) fungicide, thiophanatemethyl. Five were resistant to the DMI fungicide, propiconazole, and were selected, together with five propiconazole-sensitive isolates, for further investigations. One of the 10 isolates was resistant to propiconazole but sensitive to the SDHI fungicide, boscalid (EC50, = 0.42 mu g/ml), 3 were resistant to propiconazole with intermediate sensitivity to boscalid (EC50 0.72 to 2.1 mu g/ml); 2 were sensitive to propiconazole with intermediate sensitivity to boscalid; 3 were sensitive to propiconazole but resistant to boscalid (EC50 >= 2.1 mu g/ml); and 1 (isolate MD22) was resistant to both propiconazole and boscalid. Disease incidence on detached fruit treated with formulated propiconazole or boscalid was significantly higher for MD22 compared to a sensitive control isolate. Continued monitoring of fungicide resistance in the same orchard in 2012 revealed an increase of isolates resistant to propiconazole from 22.7% in 2011 to 34.7%, and an increase of isolates resistant to both propiconazole and boscalid from 4.5% in 2011 to 18.4%. Propiconazole resistance was always associated with the presence of the 'Mona' mobile element located upstream of the sterol 14 alpha-demethylase (MfGYP51) gene. To investigate whether mutations in the subunits of the succinate dehydrogenase enzyme were involved in boscalid resistance, significant portions of the M. fructicola SdhA, SdhB, SdhC, and SdhD genes were cloned and analyzed for 2 sensitive, 2 boscalid-resistant, and 6 dual-resistant isolates. Although sequence variation was found among the isolates, no single change correlated with resistance. Interestingly, analysis of isolates collected from orchards in 2001 and 2002, prior to the registration of boscalid, revealed a range of sensitivities to boscalid (EC50 0.03 to 3.46 mu g/ml) including boscalid-resistant isolates. The presence of boscalid-resistant isolates in the baseline population was unexpected and requires further investigation.									7	1	0	7	0	8			0191-2917			WOS:000317559700010

In particular, force-based or haptic skills must be addressed in simulators, especially because a large percentage of surgical errors are caused by the over-application of force. In this work, the efficacy of a novel, salient haptic skills simulator is tested as a training tool for force-based laparoscopic skills.Thirty novices with no previous laparoscopic experience trained on the simulator using a pre-test-feedback-post-test experiment model. Ten participants were randomly assigned to each of the three salient haptic skills-grasping, probing, and sweeping-on the simulator. Performance was assessed by comparing force performance metrics before and after training on the simulator.Data analysis indicated that absolute error decreased significantly for all three salient skills after training. Participants also generally decreased applied forces after training, especially at lower force levels. Overall, standard deviations also decreased after training, suggesting that participants improved their variability of applied forces.The novel, salient haptic skills simulator improved the precision and accuracy of participants when applying forces with the simulator. These results suggest that the simulator may be a viable tool for laparoscopic force skill training. However, further work must be undertaken to establish full validity. Nevertheless, this work presents important results toward addressing simulator-based force-skills training specifically and surgical skills training in general.									11	0	0	5	0	13			0930-2794			WOS:000317853100027	23239301

Detection of Puccinia pelargonii-zonalis-infected Geranium Tissues and Urediniospores								JOURNAL OF PHYTOPATHOLOGY				161	5			341	347		10.1111/jph.12072			MAY 2013	2013	The occurrence of geranium rust (caused by Puccinia pelargonii-zonalis) in commercial greenhouses can result in unmarketable plants and significant economic losses. Currently, detection of geranium rust relies solely on scouting for symptoms and signs of the disease. The purpose of this research was to develop a rapid detection assay for P.pelargonii-zonalis-infected tissues or urediniospores on greenhouse-grown geraniums. Two oligonucleotide primers were designed based on internal transcribed spacer sequence data from three isolates of P.pelargonii-zonalis. The primers amplified a 131-bp product from genomic DNA from each isolate of P.pelargonii-zonalis but did not amplify a product from genomic DNA from twelve other rust fungi or four other plant pathogenic fungi. A PCR product was amplified consistently from solutions that contained 1ng or 100pg/ml of purified P.pelargonii-zonalis DNA in conventional PCR and at 1pg/ml using real-time PCR. The detection threshold was 102 urediniospores/ml for real-time PCR and 104 urediniospores/ml for conventional PCR using urediniospores collected by vacuum from sporulating lesions. Puccinia pelargonii-zonalis DNA was amplified by real-time PCR from urediniospores washed from a single inoculated leaf, but recovered urediniospores were below detection threshold from one inoculated leaf with 5, 10, 25 and 50 non-inoculated leaves. Conventional and real-time PCR did not detect P.pelargonii-zonalis in infected leaf tissues, presumably due to PCR inhibitors in the geranium leaf tissue. The inhibition of both conventional and real-time PCR by geranium tissues suggests that a detection assay focusing on urediniospore recovery and microscopic examination with subsequent species verification by PCR may be the most efficient method for assessing the presence of geranium rust in greenhouses.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0931-1785			WOS:000317359900006

Most studies of the one-way cyclic behavior of soils are performed in triaxial tests with constant confining pressure (CCP), which can apply cyclic compressive deviatoric stress only. However, the real stress field in subsoils under traffic loading includes varying normal stresses in three directions. Therefore, it is more desirable to simulate the in situ loading conditions induced by passing vehicles through a combination of the varying deviatoric stress and varying confining pressure. Recognizing this, two series of one-way cyclic triaxial tests on remolded saturated clay were conducted in this study; one in undrained conditions and the other in partially drained conditions. In each series, both tests with the CCP and variable confining pressure (VCP) were carried out. Comparisons between the results of the VCP and CCP tests show that the VCP plays an important role in the one-way cyclic behavior of saturated clay, in terms of excess pore-water pressure, permanent volumetric strain, and permanent axial strain. Specifically, in partially drained conditions VCP tests deliver much larger permanent axial strain than CCP tests, indicating that the conventional CCP tests may underestimate the settlement of subsoils induced by traffic loading.

Profiles of Sibling Bullying								JOURNAL OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE				28	8			1726	1736		10.1177/0886260512468327			MAY 2013	2013	Considerable research has been done on childhood bullying, including its antecedents and consequences. Yet, with all of the attention on bullying, particularly school bullying, sibling bullying has been vastly overlooked. Sibling bullying is a type of violence prevalent in the lives of most children, but little is known about the phenomenon. The purpose of this study was to profile sibling bullying by examining prevalence rates, the extent to which siblings perceive sibling bullying to be normative, and victim-perpetrator differences in perceptions of sibling bullying. Twenty-seven sibling pairs who wrote stories about personal experiences of sibling bullying and victimization completed questionnaires about these experiences and responded to their sibling partners' stories. Of the siblings surveyed, 78% reported being bullied by their sibling and 85% reported bullying their sibling during their childhood. This is far greater than published statistics on peer bullying. Not surprisingly, victims viewed sibling bullying more negatively than perpetrators. Sadly, there was a norm of acceptance of sibling bullying among most of the sibling pairs. Practical implications are discussed.									11	0	0	3	0	11			0886-2605			WOS:000317624100010	23348680

Isolates of Didymella bryoniae from South Carolina Remain Sensitive to DMI Fungicides Despite Multiyear Exposure								JOURNAL OF PHYTOPATHOLOGY				161	5			315	323		10.1111/jph.12063			MAY 2013	2013	Triazole fungicides, which are sterol demethylation inhibitors, have become the primary systemic fungicides applied to cucurbits to control gummy stem blight caused by Didymella bryoniae. Isolates of D. bryoniae from South Carolina that were never exposed to tebuconazole or exposed for several years were tested for sensitivity to tebuconazole and difenoconazole. Colony diameters, percentage germination of ascospores and conidia, and germ tube lengths were measured when isolates were grown on agar amended with 0.1010.0mg/l tebuconazole and 0.011.0mg/l difenoconazole. All 147 isolates tested were sensitive to tebuconazole and difenoconazole with mean EC50 values of 0.41 and 0.054mg/l, respectively. Ascospore germination was greater than conidia germination on fungicide-amended agar. Although the length of germ tubes arising from both spore types was reduced by both fungicides, the reduction was greater for ascospore germ tubes than for conidia germ tubes. Because many watermelon growers rotate crops among fields every two years, local populations of D. bryoniae have not been exposed repeatedly to tebuconazole. In addition, growers often apply a rotation of systemic and contact fungicides.

Location The Barro Colorado Nature Monument (BCNM), central Panama. The BCNM comprises Barro Colorado Island (BCI) and five adjacent mainland peninsulas and is a mosaic of tropical old-growth (OG) and secondary forests (SF). Methods We studied the species and functional composition of seedling, sapling and adult tree communities in a chronosequence of SF stands ranging in age from 20 to 100yrs since abandonment, as well as two OG stands for comparison. Functional composition was defined as the representation of species with different degrees of shade tolerance. We also examined patterns of species diversity and dominance to better understand processes driving compositional changes. Results Species diversity recovered rapidly, and, by 20yrs, species richness for all size classes was equivalent if not higher in SF compared to OG. Species diversity tended to be lower and species dominance higher for seedlings than saplings or adults. Seedling, sapling and adult tree species composition did not clearly increase in similarity to OG with forest age. Instead, differences in species composition among stands reflected variation in dominance by particular species. Light-demanding species became less common and shade-tolerant species more common over stand age, with the functional composition of older secondary forests converging on that of OG. The seedling and sapling communities across the chronosequence were composed of a shade-tolerant subset of those species found in the stands as adults. Conclusion Our results suggest that recruitment into the seedling community of SF is determined by both predictable (e.g. selection for shade-tolerant species) and unpredictable factors (e.g. species-specific reproduction events and dispersal limitation). Recruitment into the sapling and tree communities reflects stronger, and potentially compounded, selection for shade-tolerant species. Therefore, changes in the species composition of regenerating forests in this area appear to be unpredictable, even though the functional composition follows a more deterministic and predictable trajectory with convergence on OG over time.									22	2	0	23	0	25			1100-9233			WOS:000317018300013

To estimate the aggregate burden of maternal binge drinking on preterm birth (PTB) and low birth weight (LBW) across American sociodemographic groups in 2008. A simulation model was developed to estimate the number of PTB and LBW cases due to maternal binge drinking. Data inputs for the model included number of births and rates of preterm and LBW from the National Center for Health Statistics; female population by childbearing age groups from the U.S. Census; increased relative risks of preterm and LBW deliveries due to maternal binge drinking extracted from the literature; and adjusted prevalence of binge drinking among pregnant women estimated in a multivariate logistic regression model using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey. The most conservative estimates attributed maternal binge drinking to 8,701 (95 % CI: 7,804-9,598) PTBs (1.75 % of all PTBs) and 5,627 (95 % CI 5,121-6,133) LBW deliveries in 2008, with 3,708 (95 % CI: 3,375-4,041) cases of both PTB and LBW. The estimated rate of PTB due to maternal binge drinking was 1.57 % among all PTBs to White women, 0.69 % among Black women, 3.31 % among Hispanic women, and 2.35 % among other races. Compared to other age groups, women ages 40-44 had the highest adjusted binge drinking rate and highest PTB rate due to maternal binge drinking (4.33 %). Maternal binge drinking contributed significantly to PTB and LBW differentially across sociodemographic groups.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1092-7875			WOS:000317608200015	22711260	
J	Pei, Bin; Pang, Weichiang; Testik, Firat Y.; Ravichandran, Nadarajah								Error Quantification for Hurricane Storm Surge Simulations along the Coasts of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia								NATURAL HAZARDS REVIEW				14	2			79	88		10.1061/(ASCE)NH.1527-6996.0000095			MAY 2013	2013	This paper describes the development of a procedure to quantify errors in hurricane storm surge simulations using a decoupled wind-surge model. The state-of-the-art storm surge simulation program, advanced circulation (ADCIRC), and the Georgiou's wind-field model were used to simulate the storm surge heights associated with 169 historical hurricanes from 1922 to 2011 along the coasts of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. The storm surge modeling errors were quantified by comparing the measured with the simulated annual maximum surge heights at nine water-level observation stations maintained by the Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS). The simulated surge heights consisted of both systematic and random errors. A power equation was used to adjust the systematic errors in the simulated storm surge heights. The random errors, which are defined as the ratio of the measured to the systematic error-adjusted simulated annual maximum surge heights, were found to follow a lognormal distribution. To confirm the validity of the error quantification methodology, the simulated annual, 5-year, and 10-year maximum surge heights were adjusted using the modeling errors quantified for each of the nine CO-OPS water stations and compared with the actual storm surge observations. Good agreements were observed between the actual measurements and the error-adjusted surge elevations. The proposed methodology for quantifying modeling errors can be applied to adjust for storm surge predictions of longer return periods and can be used to develop design surge hazard maps.

J	Mobley, Catherine; Kilbourne, William								Gender Differences in Pro-Environmental Intentions: A Cross-National Perspective on the Influence of Self-Enhancement Values and Views on Technology								SOCIOLOGICAL INQUIRY				83	2			310	332		10.1111/j.1475-682X.2012.00431.x			MAY 2013	2013	While many studies have addressed the complex relationship between gender and environmental constructs, few have attempted to determine just how gender influences environmentalism. We argue that the interaction of gender with other sociocultural variables must be examined. Our study includes two of these variables: technological values and self-enhancement values. Study results indicate that the effect of gender on environmental intentions is moderated by these two variables. This is established in a multicountry study of college students in the United States, Canada, and Germany. In examining willingness to change consumption behaviors, when controlling for self-enhancement or technological values, the gender effect holds only when there are high scores for the other variable. When technological or self-enhancement scores are low, men and women are equally willing to change their intentions. The gender by technology effect was moderated somewhat by country. Thus, gender alone does not function independently in its impact on respondents' willingness to change consumption behaviors. The study results have implications for future research on the relationship between gender and environmentalism and for environmental education efforts.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0038-0245	1475-682X		WOS:000317433000006

Given an elliptic curve E, defined over K, we consider the problem of counting the number of degree two prime ideals of K with trace of Frobenius equal to r. Under certain restrictions on K, we show that "on average" the number of such prime ideals with norm less than or equal to x satisfies an asymptotic identity that is in accordance with standard heuristics. This work is related to the classical Lang-Trotter conjecture and extends the work of several authors.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0305-0041			WOS:000317068600007		
J	Hsiao, Hung-Chang; Chung, Hsueh-Yi; Shen, Haiying; Chao, Yu-Chang								Load Rebalancing for Distributed File Systems in Clouds								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS				24	5			951	962		10.1109/TPDS.2012.196			MAY 2013	2013	Distributed file systems are key building blocks for cloud computing applications based on the MapReduce programming paradigm. In such file systems, nodes simultaneously serve computing and storage functions; a file is partitioned into a number of chunks allocated in distinct nodes so that MapReduce tasks can be performed in parallel over the nodes. However, in a cloud computing environment, failure is the norm, and nodes may be upgraded, replaced, and added in the system. Files can also be dynamically created, deleted, and appended. This results in load imbalance in a distributed file system; that is, the file chunks are not distributed as uniformly as possible among the nodes. Emerging distributed file systems in production systems strongly depend on a central node for chunk reallocation. This dependence is clearly inadequate in a large-scale, failure-prone environment because the central load balancer is put under considerable workload that is linearly scaled with the system size, and may thus become the performance bottleneck and the single point of failure. In this paper, a fully distributed load rebalancing algorithm is presented to cope with the load imbalance problem. Our algorithm is compared against a centralized approach in a production system and a competing distributed solution presented in the literature. The simulation results indicate that our proposal is comparable with the existing centralized approach and considerably outperforms the prior distributed algorithm in terms of load imbalance factor, movement cost, and algorithmic overhead. The performance of our proposal implemented in the Hadoop distributed file system is further investigated in a cluster environment.									20	2	0	1	0	22			1045-9219	1558-2183		WOS:000316754600010

The method hinges on a new type of substitution, which reduces multivariate integral polynomials to bivariate polynomials over finite fields and keeps the sparsity of the polynomial. We retrieve the multivariate sparse factors, term by term, using discrete logarithms. We show that our method is really effective when used for factoring multivariate polynomials that have only sparse factors and when used to extract sparse factors of multivariate polynomials that may also have dense factors.

The economic impact of SCI is estimated to be more than 4 billion dollars annually. Preclinical studies, case reports, and small clinical trials suggest that early treatment may improve neurological recovery. To date, no proven therapeutic modality exists that has demonstrated a positive effect on neurological outcome. Emerging data from recent preclinical and clinical studies offer hope for this devastating condition.

Here we test the thesis that these discrepancies are both among countries and within the sub-regions of a country. We use U.S. county-level human footprint estimates, consumer expenditure information, and local air emissions estimates from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to explore the patterns of ecological inequality occurring domestically. We do so using a spatially weighted structural equations approach, aimed at accounting for both the spatial dependence of the units of analysis and the specified causal relationships among the determinants of both ecological footprint estimates and carbon emissions. At this smaller spatial scale, findings may be more easily incorporated into policy and planning decisions, as well as practical efforts to achieve improved sustainability, especially since a significant element of environmental politics is local (O'Neill and Hymel 1994).									0	0	0	0	0	0			0273-2173			WOS:000316779500001

Their tasks are complicated by fragmented and sometimes incomplete information. To help facility managers better manage lifecycle information pertinent to managing the facility and responding to facility related patient safety events, an object oriented product model is proposed in the context of developing a healthcare facility information management framework. The product model is developed as a result of various case analyses that were conducted using Unified Modeling Language (UML) Use Cases to examine information needs for existing healthcare facility maintenance operations. The resulting classification system and its uses to respond to patient safety events are discussed in this paper. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We used a medicinally rich vegetable crop, bitter melon, as a model to evaluate the effects of seed treatment with a carbon-based nanoparticle, fullerol [C-60(OH)(20)], on yield of plant biomass and fruit characters, and phytomedicine contents in fruits.Results: We confirmed the uptake, translocation and accumulation of fullerol through bright field imaging and Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy. We observed varied effects of seed treatment at five concentrations, including non-consequential and positive, on plant biomass yield, fruit yield and its component characters, and content of five phytomedicines in fruits. Fullerol-treatment resulted in increases up to 54% in biomass yield and 24% in water content. Increases of up to 20% in fruit length, 59% in fruit number, and 70% in fruit weight led to an improvement up to 128% in fruit yield. Contents of two anticancer phytomedicines, cucurbitacin-B and lycopene, were enhanced up to 74% and 82%, respectively, and contents of two antidiabetic phytomedicines, charantin and insulin, were augmented up to 20% and 91%, respectively. Non-significant correlation inter se plant biomass, fruit yield, phytomedicine content and water content evidenced for separate genetic control and biosynthetic pathways for production of plant biomass, fruits, and phytomedicines in fruits, and also no impact of increased water uptake.Conclusions: While our results indicated possibility of improving crop yield and quality by using proper concentrations of fullerol, extreme caution needs to be exercised given emerging knowledge about accumulation and toxicity of nanoparticles in bodily tissues.									34	2	0	25	0	35			1472-6750			WOS:000318421300001	23622112

The photostability of conjugated polymer nanoparticles and CdSe quantum dots was compared, at both the ensemble and single particle level. The results provide confirmation of the hypothesis that quenching by photogenerated hole polarons is a key factor limiting the fluorescence quantum yield and maximum emission rate in conjugated polymer nanoparticles. Additionally, the results indicate the involvement of oxygen in photogeneration of hole polarons. The results also provide insight into the origin of quenching processes that could limit the performance of conjugated polymer devices.									14	0	0	0	0	14			1520-6106			WOS:000318211600042	23214470

All the nanorods grew with good alignment on the ZnO seed layers and the ZnO nanorod dimensions could be controlled by the addition of the various dopants. For instance, the diameter of the nanorods decreased with increasing atomic number of the dopants. The ratio between the near-band-edge emission (NBE) and the deep-level emission (DLE) intensities (I-NBE/I-DLE) obtained by PL gradually decreased because the DLE intensity from the nanorods gradually increased with increase in the atomic number of the dopants. We found that the dopants affected the structural and optical properties of the ZnO nanorods including their dimensions, lattice constants, residual stresses, bond lengths, PL properties, transmittance values, optical band gaps, and Urbach energies.									26	0	0	0	0	26			0253-2964			WOS:000318748000034

ANALYSIS OF VARIABLE ROVIBRATIONAL CO EMISSION LINES								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				767	2					159	10.1088/0004-637X/767/2/159			APR 20 2013	2013	We present observations of rovibrational CO in HD 100546 from four epochs spanning 2003 January through 2010 December. We show that the equivalent widths of the CO lines vary during this time period with the v = 1-0 CO lines brightening more than the UV fluoresced lines from the higher vibrational states. While the spectroastrometric signal of the hot band lines remains constant during this period, the spectroastrometric signal of the v = 1-0 lines varies substantially. At all epochs, the spectroastrometric signals of the UV fluoresced lines are consistent with the signal one would expect from gas in an axisymmetric disk. In 2003, the spectroastrometric signal of the v = 1-0 P26 line was symmetric and consistent with emission from an axisymmetric disk. However, in 2006 there was no spatial offset of the signal detected on the red side of the profile, and in 2010 the spectroastrometric offset was yet more strongly reduced toward zero velocity. A model is presented that can explain the evolution of the equivalent width of the v = 1-0 P26 line and its spectroastrometric signal by adding to the system a compact source of CO emission that orbits the star near the inner edge of the disk. We hypothesize that such emission may arise from a circumplanetary disk orbiting a gas giant planet near the inner edge of the circumstellar disk. We discuss how this idea can be tested observationally and be distinguished from an alternative interpretation of random fluctuations in the disk emission.									19	1	0	0	0	19			0004-637X			WOS:000317346800062

Eyewitness accounts of these fires were generally stories of individual human tragedies with fire behavior often described using anthropomorphic or even religious prose. However, the scenes described by the survivors are now recognized as cases of extreme fire behavior. In this paper we describe development of an animated visual representation of the Hinckley Fire in east-central Minnesota that devastated the town of Hinckley and surrounding communities on September 1, 1894. This was accomplished using modern science and technology coupled with eyewitness accounts, environmental data, and other information, all of which are easily available to educators dealing with forest fires.Data layers developed by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources allowed reconstruction of the original forest cover types. The local fire museum's preservation of historical landuse information allowed reconstruction of the built environment to accompany the eyewitness accounts. ArcGIS was used to develop geographic gridded data layers of these known historic parameters and provide input for the fire simulation program FARSITE. ArcGIS was also used to develop geometries for Visual Nature Studio to render 3D visualization of the historic built and forested environments. ArcGIS was also used to transfer fire perimeters from FARSITE to Visual Nature Studio. ParticleIllusion 3 was used to apply certain visual effects associated with extreme fire behavior consistent with both FARSITE predictions and eyewitness accounts. Both the fire simulation and visualization were able to capture many aspects of the eyewitness accounts as a single coherent fire event. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Schadock-Hewitt, Abby J.; Pittman, Jennifer J.; Stevens, Kathryn A.; Marcus, R. Kenneth								Extrusion-Based Differences in Two Types of Nylon 6 Capillary-Channeled Polymer (C-CP) Fiber Stationary Phases as Applied to the Separation of Proteins via Ion Exchange Chromatography								JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE				128	2	SI		1257	1265		10.1002/app.38509			APR 15 2013	2013	Nylon 6 capillary-channeled polymer (C-CP) fibers used as the stationary phase in high-performance liquid chromatography protein separations have been investigated. A difference in chromatographic behavior between two (presumably identical) nylon 6 C-CP fibers, designated simply as nylon 6A and nylon 6B, reveals unknown differences in their chemical and physical nature as proteins are less retained on the latter. The possible differences are evaluated through several test methods, including Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), mechanical testing, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, an organic reaction with ninhydrin, and dilute solution viscometry. Nylon 6B is shown to be a larger perimeter, stronger fiber, yet in a 200 mm, 0.8 mm i.d. column having an interstitial fraction of similar to 0.6, it has an available surface area of similar to 189 cm(2), while nylon 6A is almost double that at similar to 374 cm(2). It is revealed that when in amorphous form, the base polymers have very comparable FTIR and DSC characteristics. When in their solid, extruded fiber form there are significant differences found in crystallinity, tensile strength, molecular weight distribution, and end group density. Nylon 6A is a lower molecular weight fiber, which results in similar to 1.3x more amine end groups than nylon 6B. It is the end group density that ultimately determines the separation qualities. These results imply that both a difference in base nylon 6 molecular weight and also the fiber extrusion process have a significant influence on the performance of nylon 6 C-CP fiber separation of proteins via ion exchange chromatography.

J	Huang, Jiayan; Shi, Lu; Chen, Yingyao								Staff retention after the privatization of township-village health centers: a case study from the Haimen City of East China								BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH				13						136	10.1186/1472-6963-13-136			APR 12 2013	2013	Background: Township-village health centers in rural areas play an important role in health service system in China. In East China's Jiangsu Province, the City of Haimen privatized all 25 township-village health centers in 2002. This study assesses the effect of privatization on staff retention among these health centers.Methods: This is a retrospective study based on 10-year administrative data from Haimen City. Three waves of administrative data were collected in 2000 (2 years before privatization), 2005 (3 years after privatization) and 2009 (7 years after privatization) for all health care providers in Haimen City, including 3 county hospitals, 6 central township health centers (CTHC) and 25 township-village health centers (TVHC). The effect of privatization on TVHCs' staff retention was evaluated in comparison with the other two types of health care providers. We conducted focus groups with people from Haimen Bureau of Health and various health care providers to help understand the context of these administrative statistics.Results: Each township-village health centers had an average of 40 staff members before the privatization, and the majority of those staff members were their permanent staff. In 2005, three years after the privatization, a substantial amount of staff decrease (from 39.7 staff members per TVHC to 27.5 per TVHC) occurred in these township-village health centers. From 2000 to 2009, the total payroll in TVHCs decreased by almost 29%, while the number of their permanent staff members and nurses decreased by more than 40%. Among the two types of health care providers that did not go through a privatization, those central township health centers had no significant change on their payroll size during this period whereas the county hospitals' average payroll size actually increased by 20%, especially for the number of doctors. In addition, the average salary and caseload in TVHC showed similar decreasing trends from 2000 to 2009, while no such trends can be observed among the other two types of providers that did not undergo privatization.Conclusion: The privatization of township-village health center could have adverse effects on their staff retention, a phenomenon that occurs with a decrease in salary and caseload in these centers. To ensure that these health institutions keep providing health care for rural communities, a stronger social safety net and stronger financing of rural health insurance might be helpful in their staff retention.									1	2	0	0	0	2			1472-6963			WOS:000318310300001	23587296	
J	Stanescu, T. D.; Tewari, Sumanta								Disentangling Majorana fermions from topologically trivial low-energy states in semiconductor Majorana wires								PHYSICAL REVIEW B				87	14					140504	10.1103/PhysRevB.87.140504			APR 11 2013	2013	Majorana fermions (MFs) are predicted to occur as zero-energy bound states in semiconductor nanowire-superconductor structures. However, in the presence of disorder or smooth confining potentials, these structures can also host nontopological nearly zero-energy states. Here, we demonstrate that the MFs and the nearly zero topologically trivial states have different characteristic signatures in a tunneling conductance measurement, which allows to clearly discriminate between them. We also show that low-energy nontopological states can strongly hybridize with metallic states from the leads, which generates the smooth background that characterizes the soft superconducting gap measured in tunneling experiments and produces an additional decoherence mechanism for the Majorana mode. Our results pave the way for the conclusive identification of MFs in a solid state system and provide directions for minimizing quantum decoherence in Majorana wires.

Additionally, cells of the same origin (tissue) behave differently depending on the biomaterial matrix in or on which they are grown in vitro. We examined both Matrigel(TM) and a collagen/agarose blend and demonstrated that two murine mammary derived cells lines, 4T1 and NMuMG, derived from a metastatic mammary tumor or a normal mammary gland, respectively, exhibit different growth and differentiation patterns depending on the three-dimensional matrix in which they are grown. The shape and size of the colonies that formed were matrix dependent. The two cell lines produced different levels of growth factors and metalloproteinases, and expressed differentiation markers specific to a matrix. Through the classification of different cell behaviors in different growth matrices, we will be able to intelligently design and tune tissue test systems to ask and answer specific challenging scientific questions.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0920-5063			WOS:000319094400008	23565914

The employed computational methods and tools are verified and validated by first demonstrating that they can quite accurately reproduce analytical solutions for a couple of well-defined blast wave propagation and interaction problems. Then the methods/tools are used to investigate the fluid-structure interaction phenomena involving deformable structures while accounting for both the interaction of the incident blast wave with the structure and for the structure-motion induced blast wave (at the back-face of the structure). To assess the role of the structure deformability, i.e. the role of the shock waves generated within the structure, the results obtained are compared with their rigid structure counterparts. This comparison established that no additional structure-deformability-related blast-mitigation effects are observed in the case of fully supported blast wave loading while, under exponentially decaying blast wave loading, such effects are observed but only under conditions when the shock wave propagation time within the structure is comparable with the incident wave decay time.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1464-4207			WOS:000318795300004

Enumeration of Sublethally Injured Escherichia coli O157:H7 ATCC 43895 and Escherichia coli Strain B-41560 Using Selective Agar Overlays versus Commercial Methods								JOURNAL OF FOOD PROTECTION				76	4			674	679		10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-12-363			APR 2013	2013	Quality control procedures during food processing may involve direct inoculation of food samples onto appropriate selective media for subsequent enumeration. However, sublethally injured bacteria often fail to grow, enabling them to evade detection and intervention measures and ultimately threaten the health of consumers. This study compares traditional selective and nonselective agar-based overlays versus two commercial systems (Petrifilm and Easygel) for recovery of injured E. coli B-41560 and O157:H7 strains. Bacteria were propagated in tryptic soy broth (TSB), ground beef slurry, and infant milk formula to a density of 10(6) to 10(8) CFU/ml and then were stressed for 6 min either in lactic acid (pH 4.5) or heat shocked for 3 min at 60 degrees C. Samples were pour plated in basal layers of either tryptic soy agar (TSA), sorbitol MacConkey agar (SMAC), or violet red bile agar (VRB) and were resuscitated for 4 h prior to addition of agar overlays. Other stressed bacteria were plated directly onto Petrifilm and Easygel. Results indicate that selective and nonselective agar overlays recovered significantly higher numbers (greater than 1 log) of acid- and heat-injured E. coli O157: H7 from TSB, ground beef, and infant milk formula compared with direct plating onto selective media, Petrifilm, or Easygel, while no significant differences among these media combinations were observed for stressed E. coli B-41560. Nonstressed bacteria from TSB and ground beef were also recovered at densities significantly higher in nonselective TSA-TSA and in VRB-VRB and SMAC-SMAC compared with Petrifilm and Easygel. These data underscore the need to implement food safety measures that address sublethally injured pathogens such as E. coli O157: H7 in order to avoid underestimation of true densities for target pathogens.									3	1	0	3	0	4			0362-028X	1944-9097		WOS:000326079100018	23575132	
J	Jones, Joshua J.; Mears, Laine								Thermal Response Modeling of Sheet Metals in Uniaxial Tension During Electrically-Assisted Forming								JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME				135	2					021011	10.1115/1.4023366			APR 2013	2013	For the current practice of improving fuel efficiency and reducing emissions in the automotive sector, it is becoming more common to use low density/high strength materials instead of costly engine/drivetrain technologies. With these materials there are normally many manufacturing difficulties that arise during their incorporation to the vehicle. As a result, new processes which improve the manufacturability of these materials are necessary. This work examines the manufacturing technique of electrically-assisted forming (EAF) where an electrical current is applied to the workpiece during deformation to modify the material's formability. In this work, the thermal response of sheet metal for stationary (i.e., no deformation) and deformation tests using this process are explored and modeled. The results of the model show good agreement for the stationary tests while for the deformation tests, the model predicts that all of the applied electrical current does not generate Joule heating. Thus, this work suggests from the observed response that a portion of the applied current may be directly aiding in deformation (i.e., the electroplastic effect). Additionally, the stress/strain response of Mg AZ31 under tensile forming using EAF is presented and compared to prior experimental work for this material.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1087-1357	1528-8935		WOS:000326181200011

Equitable Multi-Objective Optimization Applied to the Design of a Hybrid Electric Vehicle Battery								JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN				135	4					041004	10.1115/1.4023553			APR 2013	2013	This work considers the impact of thermal behavior in battery design. The cell performance worsens when the operating temperature falls outside of the ideal range, and evenness of cell temperatures is sought to prevent cell electrical unbalance which may lead to performance fading and premature failure. The heat transfer between the cells and the coolant depends on the cell packaging and layout. A multi-objective optimization model is posed whose Pareto efficient designs minimize cell temperature deviations while maintaining evenness of temperature distribution. The special characteristics of the battery design problem (comparable objectives, anonymity and Pigou-Dalton principle of transfers) make it suitable for the application of the equitability preference, which is a refinement of the Pareto optimality that has not been used in engineering design. The proposed approach based on equitability is applied to compute the spacing of the cylindrical cells in a battery module that yields an optimal thermal behavior.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1050-0472			WOS:000326171000005

Scanning electron microscopic-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy were used to characterize the GRT particles. The kinetic parameters of curing process were determined by isoconversional method given by Malek. The average activation energy E (a) was found to be 52.3-60.7 and 45-59.2 kJ/mol for neat epoxy amine (Epo am 31) and epoxy/amine with GRT (5 Epo am 31) systems, respectively. It was observed that the presence of GRT in epoxy/amine promotes the curing. A two parameter (m, n) autocatalytic model (SB equation) was found to be the most adequate to describe the cure kinetics of the studied epoxy/GRT system. A dominant catalyzing effect of GRT on the curing reaction was observed which is attributed to the complexity of the reaction at later stages of curing, therefore, it was not possible to model the reaction over the whole range of degree of conversion.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0170-0839			WOS:000316226700018

ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS				27				48	55		10.1016/j.ecolind.2012.11.015			APR 2013	2013	Taxonomic sufficiency (TS) - defined as the minimum taxonomic detail required to discern some ecological pattern of interest - has been used extensively in bioassessment and biodiversity studies as a way of avoiding a portion of the time and monetary costs associated with species diagnoses. The taxonomic sufficiency for detecting species-level patterns among floodplain-lake benthic-invertebrate assemblages remains unexplored. We examined cross-taxonomic-level congruence in assemblage-environment relationships among 23 Chinese floodplain lakes. Our objectives were: (1) to compare the correlation between species richness and density and those at coarser taxonomic resolution; (2) to identify whether assemblage-environment relationships depend on taxonomic scale; and (3) to test whether the proportion of between-lake variability accounted for by environmental variables was independent of taxonomic scale. When taxonomic structure was described using sequentially coarser taxonomic aggregations, species-level patterns of richness and abundance were sequentially obscured (i.e., genus-level taxonomy best preserved patterns in species composition, order- and class-level taxonomy poorly represented species composition). Similar environmental variables were important for distinguishing lake species assemblages and genus assemblages; however, different environmental variables were important for describing family-, order-, and class-level assemblage patters. Moreover, environmental variables accounted for a similar amount of biological variability, regardless of taxonomic scale. Our results suggest genus taxonomy as sufficient for rapid assessments of lake diversity. Numerical dominance of the species- and genus-rich Chironomidae, Tubificidae, and Naididae, may account for the marked loss of information that occurs when lake invertebrates are assigned only to their families. In summary, we describe taxonomic sufficiency to detecting patterns of richness and abundance among subtropical lake macroinvertebrate faunas. This study will interest Chinese benthologists concerned with conservation and bioassessment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We give the first published North American records (other than port-of-entry interceptions) of H. urticae, based on fieldwork in British Columbia in 2010 and 2011. We also give new distribution records for H. behrensii, a species of special concern in the province; it previously was known in Canada only from one site in British Columbia. Morphological characters are provided to distinguish the species. Both heterogastrids were collected from stinging nettle in British Columbia's Lower Fraser Valley and on Vancouver Island; H. urticae also was taken in the Vancouver Metro Area. The species were syntopic in two nettle colonies. We suggest that the heterogastrids' syntopy provides an opportunity to determine whether the adventive H. urticae might adversely affect the native H. behrensii.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0013-8797			WOS:000318753900009

As United States demographics shift and the nation continues to recognize the value of workplace diversity, engineering education stakeholders continue to seek ways to increase participation of women and minority students.Purpose Our research examines the following question: For Hispanic women whose parents have limited educational attainment, what available sources of potential social capital do they identify, and by what means do they access and activate these resources in their decisions to select and persist in engineering as a college major? We hope to provide insights for United States institutions that serve Hispanic students, as well as those seeking to diversify their student body.Design/method Utilizing Lin's network theory of social capital as a framework, we employed semi-structured interviews in a multiple case study research methodology, taking a constructivist epistemological view.Results Three major findings are that (1) lack of available family social capital was supplemented mostly by school personnel; (2) delayed recognition or identification of available resources slowed access and activation of resources, leading to difficult university transitions; and (3) if accessed and activated, peer groups and institutional support systems provided sources of social capital.Conclusions Even single instances or weak ties can be effective in bridging gaps in engineering-related social capital. Facilitating opportunities for students to develop sustained social capital may have potential to attract and retain underrepresented students in engineering.									18	0	0	0	0	18			1069-4730			WOS:000322314500003

Rotating the arm around the minimum inertia tensor axis (e(3)) reduces the contribution of muscle torque to net torque by employing interaction torque. The present experiment tested whether the MIR principle still governs rotational movements when subjects were instructed to maintain the humeral long axis (SH-EL) as closely as possible to horizontal. With this view, the variability of 3D trajectories of the minimum inertia axis (e(3)), shoulder-center of mass axis (SH-CM) and shoulder-elbow axis (SH-EL) was quantified using a VICON V8i motion capture system. The axis for which the 3D variability displacement is minimal is considered as the one constraining the control of arm rotation. Subjects (n = 15) rotated their arm in two elbow angular configurations (Elb90 degrees vs. Elb140 degrees), two angular velocity conditions (slow S vs. fast F), and two sensory conditions (kinaesthetic K vs. visuo-kinaesthetic VK). The minimum inertia axis e(3) is angled 5.4 degrees away from SH-CM axis, and varied from 27 degrees to 15 degrees away from de SH-EL axis, for Elb90 degrees and Elb140 degrees, respectively. We tested whether the participants would be able to maintain the instructed SH-EL rotation axis or if increasing the frequency of the arm rotations would override the initial rotation instructions and cause the limb to rotate around an axis closely aligned with e(3). We expected that VK inputs would minimize the variability of the SH-EL axis and that K should facilitate the detection and rotation around e(3) at the faster velocity. Taken together the results showed that the initial instruction, favoring rotation around the SH-EL axis, prevented the velocity-dependent change towards the minimum inertia (e(3)) and/or the mass axis (SH-CM), i.e., use of the MIR principle. However, the variability of the SH-EL axis was significantly increased in the F condition, confirming that arm rotations around the SH-EL axis produces larger mechanical instabilities in comparison to when the arm is rotated around a mass/inertial axis (Isableu et al., 2009).

Cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid is endogenously synthesized from palmitelaidic (C16:1 trans-9) acid in bovine adipocytes								JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE				91	4			1614	1623		10.2527/jas.2012-5590			APR 2013	2013	Palmitelaidic (C16:1 trans-9) acid has been suggested to have beneficial effects on human health, including reduced adiposity. Objectives of this research were to quantify the amounts of palmitelaidic acid in beef samples and determine the effect of palmitelaidic acid supplementation on lipogenesis in bovine preadipocytes and adipocytes in vitro. For the first objective, palmitelaidic acid content of LM samples from steers finished on forage or concentrate systems was determined. Palmitelaidic acid in LM samples from forage-finished beef ranged from 10 to 17 mg/100 g of muscle corresponding to 0.52% to 0.65% of total fatty acids. Forage species grazed during finishing, and animal age at harvest also altered palmitelaidic acid concentrations and contents in the LM of forage-finished beef. Palmitelaidic acid concentration of concentrate-finished beef was lower (P < 0.05; 0.25% vs. 0.56%); however, because of increased (P < 0.05) total fatty acid content with concentrate finishing, amount of palmitelaidic acid was similar (P > 0.05) to beef from steers finished on pearl millet and greater (P < 0.05) than those finished on alfalfa. For the second objective, undifferentiated preadipocytes and differentiated adipocytes were supplemented with 0 to 300 mu M of palmitelaidic acid. Palmitelaidic acid supplementation reduced (P < 0.05) cell viability of undifferentiated preadipocytes at greater levels (150 and 300 mu M) but did not affect (P > 0.05) the viability of differentiated adipocytes. In preadipocytes, palmitelaidic acid increased (P < 0.05) palmitelaidic and trans-11 vaccenic (C18:1 trans-11) acids at high levels of supplementation (300 mu M). In adipocytes, palmitelaidic acid supplementation increased (P < 0.05) palmitelaidic acid, trans-11 vaccenic acid, and total fatty acid content. In addition, cis-9, trans-11 CLA also increased (P < 0.05) with palmitelaidic acid supplementation in adipocytes. These results indicate that palmitelaidic acid can be elongated in both preadipocytes and adipocytes and desaturated in adipocytes to generate trans-11 vaccenic acid and cis-9, trans-11 CLA, respectively. Beef products are a source of palmitelaidic acid in the human diet, which can be elongated and desaturated to produce trans-11 vaccenic acid and cis-9, trans-11 CLA.

By virtue of its gravitational force, the Moon produces perturbations in the temperature, density, pressure, and winds throughout Earth's atmosphere. Lunar tidal winds in the dynamo region (similar to 100-150km) can furthermore generate electric fields that map into the F-region and redistribute ionospheric plasma. Direct penetration (propagation) of lunar tides to F-region heights can also transport ionospheric plasma. Decades-long satellite data sets now exist that can provide a global perspective on lunar tidal oscillations, but this resource has not yet been exploited for this purpose. In this paper, we examine the global structure of the main M2 (period=12.42h) lunar tide through examination of temperatures measured by the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics SABER instrument at 110km and densities at 360 and 480km inferred from accelerometers on the CHAMP and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellites, respectively. Ten year mean SABER M2 temperature amplitudes are of order 5-10K while the corresponding density perturbations during the 2007-2010 solar minimum period approach amplitudes of order 5% at 360km and 10% at 480km. The observed amplitudes are large enough to impose non-negligible day-to-day variability on the IT system. Global-Scale Wave Model simulations provide a theoretical and modeling context for interpreting these data, and moreover enable estimates of E- and F-region winds.									22	1	0	0	0	22			2169-9380	2169-9402		WOS:000319924400035

Comparison of zonal neutral winds with equatorial plasma bubble and plasma drift velocities								JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS				118	4			1802	1812		10.1002/jgra.50238			APR 2013	2013	A one-year dataset spanning March 2011 to March 2012 of coincident observations of nighttime thermospheric zonal neutral winds, equatorial plasma bubble (EPB) velocities, and zonal plasma drifts is used to examine the relationship between the thermosphere and the ionosphere near the geomagnetic equator over Peru. Thermospheric neutral winds are determined by using a bistatic Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) experiment located at Merihill and Nazca in Peru. The ambient plasma drift velocities were obtained using the incoherent scatter radar at the Jicamarca Radio Observatory in Peru. The EPB zonal velocities were estimated utilizing images of the OI 630.0nm emission recorded by a narrow-field optical imaging system at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. The joint analysis of these datasets illustrates that the nighttime and night-to-night variations in the zonal neutral winds, EPB velocities, and plasma drifts are well correlated. This consistent result of the local time variations of the neutral winds with that of EPB and plasma drifts illustrates that the F-region dynamo is, in general, fully activated. However, at times, the magnitude of the EPB velocities and the plasma drifts are different from the neutral winds. It is plausible that such a difference is due either to the effect of polarization electric fields developed inside the EPB or due to the latitudinal gradient of the neutral winds and EPB velocity measurements since the EPB velocities are estimated at a higher latitude, corresponding to an apex altitude of similar to 400 km, than the wind estimates, which derive from an apex altitude of similar to 250 km.									15	1	0	0	0	15			2169-9380			WOS:000319924400036

We show that the nonuniform current/gain distribution in our previous lasers excites the second-order Bragg mode and degrades the beam quality. Ion implantation is used to provide a more uniform current distribution by confining the injected current within the grating area. The far-field measurement result shows that the near-diffraction-limited single-lobe envelope is obtained. Smaller threshold and larger slope efficiency are observed in the L-I curve as well.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1943-0655			WOS:000318574700016

Each job is associated with a family, weight (priority), release time, and size. Batching machines can process simultaneously up to a specified total size of the jobs of a particular family. The scheduling problem can be represented by Pm vertical bar r(j), batch, fmls vertical bar Sigma w(j)C(j). We present a mathematical model and heuristic algorithms employing different local search procedures individually and sequentially under a variable neighbourhood search scheme. We have shown that among local searches, repositioning the batches instead of jobs yields better results. The best-performing heuristic algorithm is capable of generating solutions within 0.6% of the best overall heuristic solution for each instance in a reasonable amount of time. When this heuristic is compared against the mathematical model, solutions that are 3.7% above optimal on average in the 15-job problem instances are possible.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0020-7543	1366-588X		WOS:000315460200017

Previous approaches to this "up-resing" problem have focused on increasing the turbulence of the underlying velocity field. Motivated by measurements in the free surface turbulence literature, we observe that past certain frequencies, it is sufficient to perform a wave simulation directly on the liquid surface, and construct a reduced-dimensional surface-only simulation. We sidestep the considerable problem of generating a surface parameterization by employing an embedding technique known as the Closest Point Method (CPM) that operates directly on a 3D extension field. The CPM requires 3D operators, and we show that for surface operators with no natural 3D generalization, it is possible to construct a viable operator using the inverse Abel transform. We additionally propose a fast, frozen core closest point transform, and an advection method for the extension field that reduces smearing considerably. Finally, we propose two turbulence coupling methods that seed the high-resolution wave simulation in visually expected regions.									4	1	0	0	0	5			0730-0301	1557-7368		WOS:000318485100005

Although a substantial amount of effort has been dedicated to the problem of surface reconstruction, a comprehensive means of evaluating this class of algorithms is noticeably absent. We propose a simple pipeline for measuring surface reconstruction algorithms, consisting of three main phases: surface modeling, sampling, and evaluation. We use implicit surfaces for modeling shapes which are capable of representing details of varying size and sharp features. From these implicit surfaces, we produce point clouds by synthetically generating range scans which resemble realistic scan data produced by an optical triangulation scanner. We validate our synthetic sampling scheme by comparing against scan data produced by a commercial optical laser scanner, where we scan a 3D-printed version of the original surface. Last, we perform evaluation by comparing the output reconstructed surface to a dense uniformly distributed sampling of the implicit surface. We decompose our benchmark into two distinct sets of experiments. The first set of experiments measures reconstruction against point clouds of complex shapes sampled under a wide variety of conditions. Although these experiments are quite useful for comparison, they lack a fine-grain analysis. To complement this, the second set of experiments measures specific properties of surface reconstruction, in terms of sampling characteristics and surface features. Together, these experiments depict a detailed examination of the state of surface reconstruction algorithms.									8	1	0	0	0	9			0730-0301	1557-7368		WOS:000318485100010

While numerous values of the internal protein dielectric constant were reported in the literature, still there is no consensus of what the optimal value is. Perhaps this is due to the fact that the protein dielectric constant is not a "constant" but is a complex function reflecting the properties of the protein's structure and sequence. Here, we report an implementation of a Gaussian-based approach to deliver the dielectric constant distribution throughout the protein and surrounding water phase by utilizing the 3D structure of the corresponding macromolecule. In contrast to previous reports, we construct a smooth dielectric function throughout the space of the system to be modeled rather than just constructing a "Gaussian surface" or smoothing molecule-water boundary. Analysis on a large set of proteins shows that (a) the average dielectric constant inside the protein is relatively low, about 6-7, and reaches a value of about 20-30 at the protein's surface, and (b) high average local dielectric constant values are associated with charged residues while low dielectric constant values are automatically assigned to the regions occupied by hydrophobic residues. In terms of energetics, a benchmarking test was carried out against the experimental pK(a)'s of 89 residues in staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) and showed that it results in a much better RMSD (= 1.77 pK) than the corresponding calculations done with a homogeneous high dielectric constant with an optimal value of 10 (RMSD = 2.43 pK).									68	0	0	26	0	69			1549-9618			WOS:000317438100026	23585741

The model identifies conditions under which the court's optimal role may be to allow tyranny of the majority and the tyrannized minority will be better off as a result. This implication hinges on the timing of two events: lifting a veil of ignorance with respect to who gains and who loses from the policy subject to judicial review, and the revelation of new information (modeled as a random shock) that affects the level of the payoffs generated by that policy. We explain how the model applies to three controversial rulings (Serrano v. Priest, Kelo v. City of New London, In re Marriage Cases). In so doing, we demonstrate how the model can help distinguish scenarios in which judicial constraints on majority rule are socially beneficial from those in which they are harmful.

Ideally, a carbon-nanotube-based drug delivery system would exhibit low toxicity, sustained drug release, and persist in circulation without aggregation. Here, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) coated with a biocompatible block-co-polymer composed of poly(lactide)-poly(ethylene glycol) (PLA-PEG) are reported to reduce short-term and long-term toxicity, sustain drug release of paclitaxel (PTX), and prevent aggregation. The copolymer coating on the surface of CNTs significantly reduces in vitro toxicity. Moreover, the coating reduces the in vitro inflammatory response. Compared to non-coated CNTs, in vivo studies show no long-term inflammatory response with CNT coated with PLA-PEG (CLP) and the surface coating significantly decreases acute toxicity by doubling the maximum tolerated dose in mice. In vivo biodistribution and histology studies suggest a lower degree of aggregation in tissues.									29	0	0	15	0	29			0934-0866			WOS:000318106000010	27642231

As a result, alternative methods have been sought for bioseparations, including the use of stimulus-responsive tags that can reversibly precipitate out of solution in response to the appropriate stimulus. While effective, stimulusresponsive tags tend to require temperature changes or relatively harsh buffer conditions to induce precipitation. Here we describe a synthetic peptide, based on the natural repeat-in-toxin (RTX) domain that undergoes gentler calcium-responsive, reversible precipitation. When coupled to the maltose binding protein (MBP), our calcium-responsive tag efficiently purified the fusion protein. Furthermore, when the MBP was appended to green fluorescent protein (GFP), beta-lactamase, or a thermostable alcohol dehydrogenase (AdhD), these constructs could also be purified by calcium-induced precipitation. Finally, protease cleavage of the precipitating tag enables the recovery of pure and active target protein by cycling precipitation before and after cleavage.									5	0	0	5	0	5			0736-6205			WOS:000317712200005	23581466

The simple traditional empirical models updated with a reliable database are employed to predict the fatigue lives of various mixtures containing crumb rubber and/or reclaimed asphalt pavement. The effects of model uncertainty and input parameter uncertainty on the fatigue life are interpreted with the probability of fatigue failure, this is defined herein as the probability that the predicted fatigue life fails to satisfy the minimum requirements of fatigue life. The probabilistic analysis of fatigue failure is estimated with a simple reliability-based approach, known as point estimate approach (PEM). Comparison study shows that the probability of fatigue failure obtained with PEM is identical with that obtained with the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). The results indicated that the probabilistic analysis using PEM and MCS methodologies can be used for exploring the fatigue life probability effectively, requires very limited computational effort, and thus has the potential and ease as a practical tool to employ in pavement engineering.

Charisma and conservation: charismatic megafauna's influence on safari and zoo tourists' pro-conservation behaviors								BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION				22	4			959	982		10.1007/s10531-013-0462-z			APR 2013	2013	Annually, millions of tourists go on safari and visit zoos primarily to view large charismatic wildlife. These venues rely on the inherent appeal of these animals to increase visitation and anchor conservation efforts. In conservation campaigns, flagship species are used to stimulate a connection to a species and promote pro-conservation behaviors. However, empirical support for behavioral outcomes associated with flagships is lacking. Nor is it known how a connection to a species influences behaviors. This study explored (a) how tourists connect to wildlife, how this relationship is influenced by the on-site experience, and how these factors interact to influence behavior, and (b) how the experiences between safari and zoo venues differed. A model was developed using interactional theory and analyzed with structural equation modeling. Data were obtained from 416 tourists to Tanzanian parks and protected areas and 452 tourists to two U.S. zoos and one aquarium. An existing connection to wildlife and experiential factors directly influenced tourists' connection to a species, but not behaviors. Tourists' connection to a species had a significant positive influence on pro-conservation behaviors for individual species and general biodiversity. The influence of the experience was equivalent across safari and zoo venues. Results support the ability of safari and zoo wildlife tourism to produce conservation outcomes.									8	0	0	3	0	9			0960-3115			WOS:000317011700008

Sago pondweed (Stuckenia pectinata) was associated with lower average water depths than water milfoil (Myriophyllum sibiricum). We detected a nonlinear relationship when average water depths were used to predict percent cover in S. pectinata, with depths of 3040cm, producing the highest predicted average percent cover of S. pectinata; higher and lower depths resulted in lower percent cover predictions. For M. sibiricum, higher water depths were monotonically associated with higher average percent cover. To foster more S. pectinata and less M. sibiricum, managers might employ water control structures to reduce water depths below 1m, using both temporary drawdowns and average depths of 3040cm. Other species responded less markedly to water depth variation. Should decreased water depths become more common, these results suggest an increase in S. pectinata and a decrease in M. sibiricum.

A direct link is important for our understanding of the supernovae physics, the diversity of SNe Ia and the use of SNe Ia for high-precision cosmology because the details of the explosion depends sensitively on the initial conditions and the explosion scenario(s) realized in nature. Do SNe Ia originate from SD- or DD systems, and do they lead to M (Ch) mass explosions or dynamical mergers? Does the statistical distribtion of SNe Ia depend on their environment which can be expected to change with redshift?In this contribution, we will exam from the theoretical point of view the tell-tails for this connection, their consistency with the observations, and future directions.In a first section, we present the physics of the explosion, light curves and spectral formation in a nutshell to help understanding the connection. For details of the progenitor evolution and explosion physics, we refer to reviews and the other contributions in this issue.Each of the topical sections starts with a brief general review followed by a more detailed discussion of specific results. Because the youth of the field, some bias is unavoidable towards results obtained within our collaborations (and FSU).The imprint of the metallicity, progenitor stars and properties such as the central density of the exploding WD are presented. IR spectroscopy, polarimetry and imaging of SNR remnants are discussed as a tool to test for the WD properties, magnetic fields and asymmetries. We discuss different classes of Type Ia supernovae, and their environment. Possible correlations between the spectroscopic and light curve properties of SN Ia are discussed.

The goal of the algorithm is to create representative in silico model structures that can be imported into finite element analysis software for mechanical characterization. Segmentation of cell and nucleus boundaries is accomplished via standard thresholding methods. Using novel linear programming methods, a representative actin stress fiber network is generated by computing a linear superposition of fibers having minimum discrepancy compared with an experimental 3D confocal image. Qualitative validation is performed through analysis of seven 3D confocal image stacks of adherent vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) grown in 2D culture. The presented method is able to automatically generate 3D geometries of the cell's boundary, nucleus, and representative F-actin network based on standard cell microscopy data. These geometries can be used for direct importation and implementation in structural finite element models for analysis of the mechanics of a single cell to potentially speed discoveries in the fields of regenerative medicine, mechanobiology, and drug discovery.

Nolan/0000-0002-9002-3585			Bioresponsive Hydrogels								ADVANCED HEALTHCARE MATERIALS				2	4			520	532		10.1002/adhm.201200332			APR 2013	2013	Bioresponsive hydrogels are emerging with technological significance in targeted drug delivery, biosensors, and regenerative medicine. Their ability to respond to specific biologically derived stimuli creates a design challenge in effectively linking the conferred biospecificity with an engineered response tailored to the needs of a particular application. Moreover, the fundamental phenomena governing the response must support an appropriate dynamic range, limit of detection, and the potential for feedback control. The design of these systems is inherently complicated due to the high interdependency of the governing phenomena that guide sensing, transduction, and actuation of the hydrogel. Future advancements in bioresponsive hydrogels will out of necessity contain control loops similar to synthetic metabolic pathways. The use of these materials will continue to expand as they become coupled and integrated with new technologies.									14	0	0	3	0	14			2192-2640			WOS:000317284500001	23233355	
J	Rosa, Angelo O.; Yamaguchi, Naohiro; Morad, Martin					da Rosa, Angelo/0000-0003-3715-4751			Mechanical regulation of native and the recombinant calcium channel								CELL CALCIUM				53	4			264	274		10.1016/j.ceca.2012.12.007			APR 2013	2013	L-type calcium channels are modulated by a host of mechanisms that include voltage, calcium ions (Ca2+ dependent inactivation and facilitation), cytosolic proteins (CAM, CAMKII, PKA, PKC, etc.), and oxygen radicals. Here we describe yet another Ca2+ channel regulatory mechanism that is induced by pressure-flow (PF) forces of similar to 25 dyn/cm(2) producing 35-60% inhibition of channel current. Only brief periods (300 ms) of such PF pulses were required to suppress reversibly the current. Recombinant Ca2+ channels (alpha 1c77/beta 2a/alpha 2 delta and alpha 1c77/beta 1/alpha 2 delta), expressed in HEK293 cells, were similarly suppressed by PF pulses. To examine whether Ca2+ released by PF pulses triggered from different sub-cellular compartments (SR, ER, mitochondria) underlies the inhibitory effect of PF on the channel current, pharmacological agents and ionic substitutions were employed to probe this possibility. No significant difference in effectiveness of PF pulses to suppress I-Ca or I-Ba (used to inhibit CICR) was found between control cells and those exposed to U73122 and 2-APB (PLC and IP3R pathway modulators), thapsigargin and BAPTA (SERCA2a modulator), dinitrophenol, FCCP and Ru360 (mitochondrial inhibitors), L-NAME (NOS inhibitor signaling), CAMP and Pertussis toxin (G(i) protein modulator). We concluded that the rapid and reversible modulation of the Ca2+ channel by PF pulses is independent of intracellular release of Ca2+ and Ca2+ dependent inactivation of the channel and may represent direct mechanical regulatory effect on the channel protein in addition to previously reported Ca2+-release or entry dependent mechanism.

The restoration was conducted by harvesting marsh sods from an adjacent natural marsh and planting in the restoration site. Both restoration designs are on suitable scales for private property owners to conduct, but differed in initially planted coverage area. One design was fully planted (100% coverage of planted marsh sods; termed full density design) and the other design was planted at half the density of the fully planted design (50% coverage of planted marsh sods; termed half density design). We found no consistent differences in the measured metrics between the two restoration designs and few differences between restored sites and reference natural marsh stands. These findings suggest the potential similar functionality across all treatments. The only metrics with consistent differences among treatments were increased leaf nutrient and chlorophyll content in the restored plots when compared to natural stands. These differences are potentially attributable to nutrient-rich runoff from an adjacent parking lot to the restoration site. Total vegetated coverage area for half density plots was similar to full density plots at 2.1 years after planting. Cost-effectiveness analysis of both designs across eight differing restoration scenarios (based on hiring or donation of cost categories) resulted in half density plots having higher or equal cost-effectiveness in seven of the eight scenarios. Half density plots were approximately twice as cost-effective in scenarios with donated pre-planting site construction. Based on the similar vegetated area between the two designs and lower cost and restoration effort, we suggest the half density design as a more cost-effective restoration strategy than the full density design and should be considered for small-scale Black needlerush restoration projects.

Independently collected data for both generations allow us to establish effects of parental characteristics on children's orientations without the confounding potential inherent in children's reports about parents. We analyse first determinants of parental ambition and, through a series of stepwise regressions, the effects of these goals and other parental and family characteristics on children's aspirations and expectations. A structural equations model synthesizes the results of the analysis. The model confirms predictions from the research literature, especially those based on the Wisconsin status attainment model, but rejects others, including the predicted significance of private versus public school attendance. Parental ambition, knowledge of Spanish by parents and children, gender and children's age are major determinants of youths' educational and occupational goals. These results have direct implications for policy; these are discussed in the conclusion.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0141-9870			WOS:000317266100002	27761056

It enlisted cooks in hands-on "cooking with the chef' training and menu building exercises, and demonstrated development of flavor in foods through healthy ingredients. Cook ratings from pre- to post-training (possible range: 1-10) were evaluated with the Wilcoxon signed rank test.Results: 114 cooks from 57 churches over the period from 7/21/07 to 3/21/11 participated in trainings. Self-rated cooking skill increased from pre- (6.5 +/- SD) to post-training (7.9 +/- SD), p = 0.0001. Self-rated confidence in preparing meals also increased significantly (pre: 7.3 +/- SD; post: 8.3 +/- SD), p = 0001.Qualitative feedback from the cooks' training has been positive. Two of the more frequently stated changes cooks report are using less salt and using more vegetables and fruits in menus. Lessons learned include: choosing the right church to host the training, teamwork as a key component, need for support system for church cooks, allocation of time for planning as well as shopping for healthy ingredients, and incorporation of flexibility into the training plan.

We tested this hypothesis by examining whether the locomotion of tachymetabolic tetrapods (birds and mammals) is more rhythmic than that of bradymetabolic tetrapods (lizards, alligators, turtles, salamanders). Species averages of intraindividual coefficients of variation in cycle period were compared while controlling for gait and substrate. Variance in locomotor cycle periods is significantly lower in tachymetabolic than in bradymetabolic animals for datasets that include treadmill locomotion, non-treadmill locomotion, or both. When phylogenetic relationships are taken into account the pooled analyses remain significant, whereas the non-treadmill and the treadmill analyses become nonsignificant. The co-occurrence of relatively high rhythmicity in both feeding and locomotor systems of tachymetabolic tetrapods suggests that the anatomical substrate of rhythmicity is in the motor control system, not in the musculoskeletal components.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0014-3820			WOS:000317133800025	23550769

The WWTP effluent increased dissolved organic carbon (DOC), ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (UV254), anions, and DBP precursors at the discharge and downstream locations. During this study, the MIEX1 process reduced DOC by 42-47%, UV254 absorbance by 61-68%, and trihalomethane (THM) and haloacetic acid (HAA) formation potential (FP) by 50-70% at different downstream locations. On the other hand, only 10-15% halonitromethane (HNM) FP was reduced, and N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) FP increased as a result of chloramination after MIEX treatment. Uniform formation condition (UFC) experiments showed that NDMA concentrations remained below 10 ng/L when chlorine or prechlorination was used for postdisinfection. However, the use of preformed chloramine resulted in 36 ng/L of NDMA formation. Because MIEX is capable of removing a substantial amount of THM and HAA precursors, it may allow the use of more chlorine for longer contact time, which can result in less NDMA formation.									2	0	0	1	0	2			2164-4535			WOS:000317260600010

Relationship between anisotropic diffusion properties and tissue morphology in porcine TMJ disc								OSTEOARTHRITIS AND CARTILAGE				21	4			625	633		10.1016/j.joca.2013.01.010			APR 2013	2013	Objective: To investigate the relationship between anisotropic solute diffusion properties and tissue morphology in porcine temporomandibular joint (TMJ) discs.Design: TMJ discs from eleven pigs aged 6-8 months were divided into five regions: anterior, intermediate, posterior, lateral, and medial. The transport properties and tissue morphology were investigated in three orthogonal orientations: anteroposterior (AP), mediolateral (ML), and superoinferior (SI). The anisotropic diffusivity of fluorescein (332 Da) in the right discs was determined by the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) protocols. The tissue morphology in the left discs was quantified by scanning electron microscopy.Results: The diffusivities of fluorescein in the TMJ disc were significantly anisotropic, except for the anterior region. In the medial, intermediate, and lateral regions, the diffusion along the fiber orientation (i.e., AP direction) was significantly faster than the diffusion in ML and SI directions. In the posterior region, the diffusion along the fiber orientation (i.e., ML direction) was significantly faster than the diffusion in AP and SI directions. The diffusion in the anterior region was mostly isotropic with the lowest degree of diffusion anisotropy, as well as collagen fiber alignment, likely due to the multi-directional fiber arrangement. The anterior region had the highest mean diffusivity [65.6 (493-81.8) mu m(2)/s] in the disc, likely due to its high water content. The overall average diffusivity of fluorescein across the TMJ disc was 57.0 (43.0-71.0) mu m(2)/s.Conclusions: The solute diffusion in porcine TMJ discs was strongly anisotropic and inhomogeneous, which associated with tissue structure (i.e., collagen fiber alignment) and composition (e.g., water content).

Differential Gene Expression in Nuclear Label-Retaining Cells in the Developing Mouse Mammary Gland								STEM CELLS AND DEVELOPMENT				22	8			1297	1306		10.1089/scd.2012.0496			APR 2013	2013	The immortal strand theory postulates stem cells protect themselves from DNA replication-associated mutations and subsequent cancer risk through selective segregation of template DNA strands. Stem cells self-renew by asymmetric cellular division. During asymmetric division, stem cells maintain their template DNA strands, while the newly synthesized DNA strands segregate to newly formed daughter cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that self-renewing mammary stem cells originate in the expanding mammary ducts during puberty-associated allometric growth. In this study, we labeled newly forming mammary stem cells with the thymidine analog 5-ethynl-2'-deoxyuridine for 2 weeks during allometric ductal expansion. Cells that incorporate and retain the nuclear label following extended chase periods are termed label-retaining cells (LRCs). A second nuclear label, 5-bromodeoxyuridine, was administered before euthanasia to identify cells traversing the cell cycle. Mammary cells collected following euthanasia were sorted based on nuclear label retention. Members of the Notch and Wnt signaling pathways were found differentially expressed by mammary LRCs. These pathways are involved in the regulation of stem cells in the mouse mammary gland. Upon further analysis, we found that in contrast to non-LRCs, Notch1 and Notch2 are expressed and localized in the nuclei of the LRCs. Expression of Notch-inducible genes, Hes1 and Hey2, was elevated in LRCs. Inhibition of Notch1 by shRNA reduced colony forming potential and label retention by mammary epithelial cells in vitro. These results indicate that genes are differentially regulated in the LRC population of mammary glands and Notch1 mediates asymmetric cell division of mammary progenitor cells.									3	0	0	2	0	3			1547-3287	1557-8534		WOS:000317474500014	23199335

Joint location and dispatching decisions for Emergency Medical Services								COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING				64	4			917	928		10.1016/j.cie.2013.01.002			APR 2013	2013	The main purpose of Emergency Medical Service systems is to save lives by providing quick response to emergencies. The performance of these systems is affected by the location of the ambulances and their allocation to the customers. Previous literature has suggested that simultaneously making location and dispatching decisions could potentially improve some performance measures, such as response times. We developed a mathematical formulation that combines an integer programming model representing location and dispatching decisions, with a hypercube model representing the queuing elements and congestion phenomena. Dispatching decisions are modeled as a fixed priority list for each customer. Due to the model's complexity, we developed an optimization framework based on Genetic Algorithms. Our results show that minimization of response time and maximization of coverage can be achieved by the commonly used closest dispatching rule. In addition, solutions with minimum response time also yield good values of expected coverage. The optimization framework was able to consistently obtain the best solutions (compared to enumeration procedures), making it suitable to attempt the optimization of alternative optimization criteria. We illustrate the potential benefit of the joint approach by using a fairness performance indicator. We conclude that the joint approach can give insights of the implicit trade-offs between several conflicting optimization criteria. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A median x pi is a vertex for which the sum of the distances from x to the vertices in the profile is minimum. The median function finds the set of all medians of a profile. Medians are important in location theory and consensus theory. A median graph is a graph for which every profile of length 3 has a unique median. Median graphs have been well studied, possess a beautiful structure and arise in many arenas, including ternary algebras, ordered sets and discrete distributed lattices. They have found many applications, for instance in location theory, consensus theory and mathematical biology. Trees and hypercubes are key examples of median graphs.We establish a succinct axiomatic characterization of the median procedure on median graphs, settling a question posed implicitly by McMorris, Mulder and Roberts in 1998 [19]. We show that the median procedure can be characterized on the class of all median graphs with only three simple and intuitively appealing axioms, namely anonymity, betweenness and consistency. Our axiomatization is tight in the sense that each of these three axioms is necessary.

Such a separation exploits the reservoir-based dielectrophoresis, which is induced by the inherent electric field gradient formed at the reservoirmicrochannel junction, to isolate the trapped fluorescent particles within the reservoir from the streaming nonfluorescent particles. The effects of the DC field magnitude (or equivalently the electrokinetic flow magnitude) and the AC field frequency of DC-biased AC electric fields are investigated on particle separation. A numerical model is also developed to simulate the electrokinetic transport behaviors of the two types of particles. This demonstrated reservoir-based dielectrophoresis particle sorter can operate in parallel to increase the flow throughput. It is suitable for integration with other functional parts into lab-on-a-chip devices for diverse particle handling.									11	0	0	4	0	11			0173-0835			WOS:000317017000003	23161644

Despite the widespread occurrence of PFCs, little is known about the impact these contaminants have on the health of wildlife populations. The authors investigated the relationship between PFCs (including Sigma perfluorocarboxylates, Sigma perfluoroalkyl sulfonates, perfluorooctane sulfonate, perfluorooctanoic acid, and perfluorodecanoic acid) and the clinocopathologic and immune parameters in a highly exposed population (n=79) of Atlantic bottlenose dolphins (mean Sigma PFCs=1970ng/ml; range 5748670ng/ml) sampled from 2003 to 2005 near Charleston, South Carolina, USA. Age-adjusted linear regression models showed statistically significant positive associations between exposure to one or more of the PFC totals and/or individual analytes and the following immunological parameters: absolute numbers of CD2+ T cells, CD4+ helper T cells, CD19+ immature B cells, CD21+ mature B cells, CD2/CD21 ratio, MHCII+ cells, B cell proliferation, serum IgG1, granulocytic, and monocytic phagocytosis. Several PFC analyte groups were also positively associated with serum alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, creatinine, phosphorus, amylase, and anion gap and negatively associated with cholesterol levels, creatinine phosphokinase, eosinophils, and monocytes. Based on these relationships, the authors suggest that the PFC concentrations found in Charleston dolphins may have effects on immune, hematopoietic, kidney, and liver function. The results contribute to the emerging data on PFC health effects in this first study to describe associations between PFCs and health parameters in dolphins. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2013;32:736746.

Effects of a 48-h fast on heart rate variability and cortisol levels in healthy female subjects								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION				67	4			401	406		10.1038/ejcn.2013.32			APR 2013	2013	BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The physiological changes that occur during fasting are not completely understood, regardless of the cause for fasting (for example, medical, lifestyle, religious, political or famine). The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a 48-h fast on heart rate variability (HRV) and cortisol levels in healthy young female volunteers.SUBJECTS/METHODS: A total of 16 young healthy female volunteers underwent 48 h of total fasting under 24-h medical surveillance. Psychological (subjective feeling of hunger) as well as physiological data (HRV, diurnal cortisol profiles) were measured upon admission (Day 1), and after 24 (Day 2) and 48 h (Day 3) of fasting.RESULTS: There was a measured weight loss from Day 1 to Day 3 that resulted in significant body mass index (BMI) reduction across all subjects (P<0.001). The slope of the diurnal cortisol profile significantly shifted towards lower values from baseline to the end of experiment (P = 0.002). HRV during resting showed a significant (P<.001) decrease in standard deviation of the normal-to-normal interval (SDNN) and root mean square of successive differences (RMSSDs) from Day 1 to Day 3 of the experiment, with a small increase after 24 h that did not reach statistical significance. A 48 h of fasting also induced a significant (P<.001) decrease of mean interbeat intervals (IBIs), SDNN, RMSSD and log high-frequency (HF) power during head-up tilt testing.CONCLUSIONS: An acute (48 h) total fast induced parasympathetic withdrawal with simultaneous sympathetic activation. These changes appear to reflect stress. Further studies are needed to demonstrate the specificity of these changes to fasting.

Activities of muscadine grape skin and polyphenolic constituents against Helicobacter pylori								JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY				114	4			982	991		10.1111/jam.12129			APR 2013	2013	Aims To identify active phenolic constituents in muscadine grape skin (MGS) extracts and determine interactions among compounds while further exploring their anti-Helicobacter pylori potential in vitro. Methods and Results The inhibitory effects of quercetin and resveratrol, active polyphenols identified in MGS extracts, against H.pylori were investigated. Quercetin and resveratrol significantly (P<0 center dot 05) reduced H.pylori counts regardless of pH with minimal bactericidal concentrations of 256 and 128gml1, respectively. MGS extracts displayed the highest efficacy, suggesting additional unidentified compounds not determined in this study. Time-course viability experiments showed a dose-dependent anti-H.pylori response to quercetin and resveratrol. Interestingly, neither quercetin nor resveratrol affected H.pylori outer membrane (OM) integrity as determined by 1-N-phenylnaphthylamine (NPN) uptake assays. However, treatment with MGS extract did increase NPN uptake, indicating OM destabilization possibly by additional unknown components. Furthermore, quercetin was found to enter H.pylori as measured by HPLC supporting intracellular drug accumulation. Conclusions Quercetin and resveratrol possess strong anti-H.pylori activity in vitro and are independent of pH. Our results also suggest that these compounds do not affect H.pylori OM integrity as previously hypothesized and that the primary antimicrobial activity of quercetin may be linked to interactions with intracellular components. Significance and Impact of the Study The anti-H.pylori effects of quercetin and resveratrol suggest that these compounds may be useful in the dietary prevention and/or treatment of H.pylori infection.									10	1	0	7	1	12			1364-5072			WOS:000316572200007	23294280

After cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species may contribute to the disease process through alterations in the structure of DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids. We generated various nanoparticles (liposomes, polybutylcyanoacrylate (PBCA), or poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA)) that contained active superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme (4,000 to 20,000 U/kg) in the mouse model of cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury to determine the impact of these molecules. In addition, the nanoparticles were untagged or tagged with nonselective antibodies or antibodies directed against the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor 1. The nanoparticles containing SOD protected primary neurons in vitro from oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and limited the extent of apoptosis. The nanoparticles showed protection against ischemia and reperfusion injury when applied after injury with a 50% to 60% reduction in infarct volume, reduced inflammatory markers, and improved behavior in vivo. The targeted nanoparticles not only showed enhanced protection but also showed localization to the CA regions of the hippocampus. Nanoparticles alone were not effective in reducing infarct volume. These studies show that targeted nanoparticles containing protective factors may be viable candidates for the treatment of stroke.

Variation in thermal habitat introduces challenges to organisms and may reduce fitness unless organisms can physiologically adjust to such changes. Theory predicts that thermal variability should influence the capacity for acclimation such that increased variation should favor a reduction in the thermal sensitivity of physiological traits. In this study, we investigated acclimation to constant and variable conditions in populations of the salamander Desmognathus brimleyorum from the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas, USA. We exposed salamanders to constant and variable temperature regimes for 8 weeks in the laboratory. We then tested salamanders for acclimation of thermal tolerance, and the thermal sensitivities of swimming performance and standard metabolic rate. Our results indicate limited capacity for thermal acclimation to constant and variable conditions in D. brimleyorum. Instead, variation in physiological traits is dominated by differences among populations. Population differences do not appear to be correlated with observed variation in the thermal conditions of the streams, but are likely a consequence of structural and ecological differences. Due to the mixed support for theoretical predictions for acclimation to alternative environments, further consideration should be given to revising and expanding current theoretical models.									4	0	0	4	0	4			0174-1578	1432-136X		WOS:000316760900009	23132671

The current study examines how shared workplace aggression concerns relate to internal and external organizational outcomes. Drawing on the work stress, social identity, and social contagion literatures, we propose relationships between unit-level aggression concerns and unit-level measures of performance and employee attitudes in a public school sample (2989 employees; 163 schools). We also propose that these relationships differ depending on the resource context of the school. Consistent with our expectations, schools in which teachers had strong shared concerns about aggression also had poorer shared job attitudes and poorer student outcomes, as indicated by average standardized test scores at the school. The impact of shared concerns about aggression on school-level standardized test scores was stronger for resource-rich schools than for schools with fewer resources. The current study contributes to organizational research as it establishes that workplace aggression concerns have adverse consequences for the whole organization, not only for the individuals experiencing the events. Our findings demonstrate that employees' shared concerns about aggression have an impact on organizational outcomes and suggest a prevention-focused approach to workplace aggression.

The research also investigated the effectiveness of a classwide jigsaw team approach. A combination of qualitative and quantitative assessment tools, including surveys, journals, interviews, and timecards, was employed to investigate the research questions. Results revealed that a real-world project with a focus on sustainability positively impacted students' critical thinking skills and led to increased knowledge of sustainability, but it also correlated with a high workload for students and faculty. Additionally, the jigsaw organization structure proved successful and yielded a positive team-building experience for the students. These results suggest open-ended problems with real project constraints can yield a uniquely beneficial learning experience without sacrificing the quality of student design or project deliverables.

Values obtained in 1996 and 2006 were compared with the current World Health Organization guidelines for chronic disease prevention.Results: Adolescents surveyed in 2006 reported a significantly higher mean daily energy intake from linoleic acid (LA) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) (0.9% and 7.8%, respectively) compared with the 1996 cohort, whereas SFA and TFA were significantly lower (9.5% and 1.3%, respectively). Food sources of fat also changed. In 2006, 2% of SPA in the diet came from palm shortening (compared with 34% in 1996); 39% of TFA came from ruminant-derived foods (in 1996, soybean oil was the main contributor of TFA, 34%), and bakery products (mainly pre-packaged cookies) provided 25% of the source of TFA, compared with only 11% in 1996. Dietary fatty intake of Costa Rican adolescents in 2006 is closer to WHO guidelines compared with 1996.Conclusions: After public health initiatives that changed fatty acid profile of most foods, intakes of TFA, SFA, and food sources of fatty acids in adolescents' diets improved. Public health nutrition efforts should continue to strengthen diets that are low in SFA and TFA and higher in ALA content among Costa Rican adolescents. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

To our knowledge, this is the first truly single mode optical fiber fabricated from a precursor crystal. It is shown that MgO increases the acoustic velocity when added to silica (some physical parameters of MgO are identified) and that the Brillouin gain in the core is less than one third that in the cladding in one of the fibers. This results from a massive acoustic waveguide attenuation term that broadens the spectrum to well over 200 MHz. For the first time, to the best of our knowledge, this also enabled the validation of the intrinsic Brillouin line-width (similar to 20 MHz) of pure silica in fiber form via a direct measurement.

Acta Mater 2010;58:4795). In the present work, the same approach is adopted to the p-type half-Heusler compound Ti(Co,Fe)Sb. The results of resistivity, Seebeck coefficient, thermal conductivity and Hall coefficient measurements indicate that the combined high-mobility electron injection, low energy electron filtering and boundary scattering, again, lead to a simultaneous improvement in all three individual thermoelectric properties: enhanced Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity as well as reduced lattice thermal conductivity. A figure of merit of ZT approximate to 0.33 was attained at 900 K for the sample containing 1.0 at.% InSb nanoinclusions, a similar to 450% improvement over the nanoinclusion-free sample. This represents a rare case that the same nanostructuring approach works successfully for both p-type and n-type thermoelectric materials of the same class, hence pointing to a promising materials design route for higher-performance half-Heusler materials in the future and hopefully will realize similar improvement in thermoelectric devices based on such half-Heusler alloys.

In recent years there has been increased attention to SiC as a viable material for biomedical applications. Of particular interest in this review is its potential for application as a biotransducer in biosensors. Among these applications are those where SiC is used as a substrate material, taking advantage of its surface chemical, tribological and electrical properties. In addition, its potential for integration as system on a chip and those applications where SiC is used as an active material make it a suitable substrate for micro-device fabrication. This review highlights the critical properties of SiC for application as a biosensor and reviews recent work reported on using SiC as an active or passive material in biotransducers and biosensors.									30	0	0	4	0	30			1387-2176			WOS:000316201300014	23319268

Thermoelectrics based on classic bismuth telluride have also started to impact the automotive industry by enhancing air-conditioning efficiency and integrated cabin climate control. In addition to engineering challenges of making reliable and efficient devices to withstand thermal and mechanical cycling, the remaining issues in thermoelectric power generation and refrigeration are mostly materials related. The dimensionless figure of merit, ZT, still needs to be improved from the current value of 1.0 to 1.5 to above 2.0 to be competitive with other alternative technologies. In the meantime, the thermoelectric community could greatly benefit from the development of international test standards, improved test methods, and better characterization tools. Internationally, thermoelectrics have been recognized by many countries as a key component for improving energy efficiency. The International Energy Agency (IEA) group under the Implementing Agreement for Advanced Materials for Transportation (AMT) identified thermoelectric materials as an important area in 2009. This paper is part I of the international round-robin testing of transport properties of bulk thermoelectrics. The main foci in part I are the measurement of two electronic transport properties: Seebeck coefficient and electrical resistivity.									43	0	0	1	0	43			0361-5235			WOS:000316024500007

Specifically, high information content fingerprinting was used to assemble 126,445 BAC clones into 1,377 contigs and 12,919 singletons. Integration of the dense Chinese chestnut genetic map with the physical map was achieved via high-throughput hybridization using overgo probes derived from sequence-based genetic markers. A total of 1,026 probes were anchored to the physical map including 831 probes corresponding to 878 expressed sequence tag-based markers. Within the physical map, three BAC contigs were anchored to the three major fungal blight-resistant quantitative trait loci on chestnut linkage groups B, F, and G. A subset of probes corresponding to orthologous genes in poplar showed only a limited amount of conserved gene order between the poplar and chestnut genomes.

A transcriptome-based genetic map of Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollissima) and identification of regions of segmental homology with peach (Prunus persica)								TREE GENETICS & GENOMES				9	2			557	571		10.1007/s11295-012-0579-3			APR 2013	2013	The Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollissima) carries resistance to Cryphonectria parasitica, the fungal pathogen inciting chestnut blight. The pathogen, introduced from Asia, devastated the American chestnut (Castanea dentata) throughout its native range early in the twentieth century. A highly informative genetic map of Chinese chestnut was constructed to extend genomic studies in the Fagaceae and to aid the introgression of Chinese chestnut blight resistance genes into American chestnut. Two mapping populations were established with three Chinese chestnut parents, 'Mahogany', 'Nanking', and 'Vanuxem', totaling 337 progeny. The transcriptome-based genetic map was created with 329 simple sequence repeat and 1,064 single nucleotide polymorphism markers all derived from expressed sequence tag sequences. Genetic maps for each parent were developed and combined to establish 12 consensus linkage groups spanning 742 cM, providing the the most comprehensive genetic map for a Fagaceae species to date. Over 75 % of the mapped markers from the Chinese chestnut consensus genetic map were placed on the physical map using overgo hybridization, providing a fully integrated genetic and physical map resource for Castanea spp. About half (57 %) of the Chinese chestnut genetic map could be assigned to regions of segmental homology with 58 % of the peach (Prunus persica) genome assembly. A three quantitative trait loci (QTL) model for blight resistance was verified using the new genetic markers and an existing interspecies (C. mollissima x C. dentata) F-2 mapping population. Two of the blight resistance QTLs in chestnut shared synteny with two QTLs for powdery mildew resistance in peach, indicating the potential conservation of disease resistance genes at these loci.									12	1	0	8	1	14			1614-2942	1614-2950		WOS:000316366200020

This disease causes severe defoliation and blemishing of fruit, particularly in areas with high rainfall, strong winds, high humidity, and sandy soil. The molecular basis of its tolerance and susceptibility in peach is yet to be understood. An F-2 population of 63 genotypes derived from a cross between peaches "O'Henry" (susceptible) and "Clayton" (resistant) has been used for linkage map construction and quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. Phenotypic data for leaf and fruit response to Xap infection were collected over 2 years at two locations. A high-density genetic linkage map that covers a genetic distance of 421.4 cM with an average spacing between markers of 1.6 cM was developed using the International Peach Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Consortium (IPSC) 9K array v1. Fourteen QTLs with an additive effect on Xap resistance were detected, including four major QTLs on linkage groups (LG) 1, 4, 5, and 6. Major QTLs, Xap.Pp.OC-4.1 and Xap.Pp.OC-4.2, on LG4 were associated with Xap resistance in leaf; Xap.Pp.OC-5.1 on LG5 was associated with Xap resistance in both leaf and fruit, while Xap.Pp.OC-1.2 and Xap.Pp.OC-6.1 on LG1 and LG6, respectively, were associated with Xap resistance in fruit. This suggested separate regulation of leaf and fruit resistance for Xap in peach as well as participation of genes involved in general plant response to biotic stress. The potential for marker-assisted selection for Xap resistance in peach is discussed.									11	0	0	11	0	11			1614-2942			WOS:000316366200021		
J	Wu, Tonggui; Yu, Mukui; Wang, Geoff; Wang, Zongxing; Duan, Xi; Dong, Yi; Cheng, Xiangrong								Effects of stand structure on wind speed reduction in a Metasequoia glyptostroboides shelterbelt								AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS				87	2			251	257		10.1007/s10457-012-9540-6			APR 2013	2013	In a Metasequoia glyptostroboides coastal forest shelterbelt near Shanghai, China, we studied relationships between stand structure and wind shelter effect. We located 16 plots at intervals of 500 m along the shelterbelt and characterized both horizontal and vertical structure of each plot. Wind speed was measured within each plot and at different distances windward and leeward. We found that wind shelter effects were closely related to stand structure of the studied M. glyptostroboides shelterbelt. Stands with high basal area but intermediate crown index and intermediate proportion of large trees (LT) produced the best shelter effects, with significantly longer shelter distance (d70, shelter distance which the wind speed U does not exceed 70 % of U (0)) and slightly lower minimum relative wind speed (U (m) /U (0)). Simple structural indices that can be easily measured in the field were good predictors of the shelter effect. LT was the best predictor of d70, while basal area at ground level was the best predictor of U (m)/U (0). The relationships between stand structure and shelter effect provides a practical guideline to the design, construction and management of forest shelterbelts. In order to provide the best shelter effects, high basal area of > 50 m(2) ha(-1) at ground level or > 33 m(2) ha(-1) at breast height coupled with an intermediate LT value of about 60 % should be maintained for the studied M. glyptostroboides shelterbelt.									2	3	0	3	0	6			0167-4366			WOS:000316006500001		
J	McMahan, Christopher S.; Tebbs, Joshua M.; Bilder, Christopher R.								Regression models for group testing data with pool dilution effects								BIOSTATISTICS				14	2			284	298		10.1093/biostatistics/kxs045			APR 2013	2013	Group testing is widely used to reduce the cost of screening individuals for infectious diseases. There is an extensive literature on group testing, most of which traditionally has focused on estimating the probability of infection in a homogeneous population. More recently, this research area has shifted towards estimating individual-specific probabilities in a regression context. However, existing regression approaches have assumed that the sensitivity and specificity of pooled biospecimens are constant and do not depend on the pool sizes. For those applications, where this assumption may not be realistic, these existing approaches can lead to inaccurate inference, especially when pool sizes are large. Our new approach, which exploits the information readily available from underlying continuous biomarker distributions, provides reliable inference in settings where pooling would be most beneficial and does so even for larger pool sizes. We illustrate our methodology using hepatitis B data from a study involving Irish prisoners.									9	0	0	6	0	9			1465-4644			WOS:000316127100007	23197382

Potential improvement in the predictive accuracy of the simulation that can be gained through improving a constituent model depends not only on the relative importance, but also on the inherent uncertainty and inaccuracy of that particular constituent. A need exists for prioritization of code development efforts to cost-effectively allocate available resources to the constituents that require improvement the most. This article proposes a novel and quantitative code prioritization index to accomplish such a task and demonstrates its application on a case study of a steel frame with semirigid connections. Findings show that as high-fidelity constituent models are integrated, the predictive ability of model-based simulation is improved; however, the rate of improvement is dependent upon the sequence in which the constituents are improved.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1093-9687			WOS:000315859700004

It aims to replace the center of inertia (COI) for on-line transient stability assessment. Compared with COI, the proposed method can give more reasonable estimations of rotor angle difference between the individual generator and the multi-machine power system. In addition, it allows generators to have their own references for evaluating transient stability, which is more reasonable and accurate than using COI. Moreover, the proposed technique calculates the rotor angle difference by using the local generator's active and reactive power output. This does not add any extra burden to the communication channel. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0378-7796			WOS:000315934800002		
J	Kruzner, Kelly; Cox, Kristin; Machmer, Brian; Klotz, Leidy								Trends in observable passive solar design strategies for existing homes in the U.S.								ENERGY POLICY				55				82	94		10.1016/j.enpol.2012.10.071			APR 2013	2013	Passive design strategies are among the most cost-effective methods to reduce energy consumption in buildings. However, the prevalence of these strategies in existing U.S. homes is not well understood. To help address this issue, this research evaluated a nationally-representative sample of 1000 existing homes distributed geographically across the US. Using satellite images, each building was evaluated for three passive design strategies: orientation, roof color, and level of shading. Several statistically significant regional trends were identified. For example, existing homes in the High Plains, Ohio Valley, Northwest, and Southern regions show a statistically significant trend towards orientation in the East-West direction, an effective passive design strategy. Less intuitively, in terms of what would seem to be optimal passive design, buildings in the High Plains and Ohio Valley generally have lighter roof colors than buildings in the warmer Southwest region. At the national level, no statistically significant trends were found towards the passive design strategies evaluated. These trends give us no reason to believe they were a major consideration in the design of existing homes. Policy measures and education may be required to take advantage of the opportunity for cost-effective energy savings through more widespread passive solar design. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Cotet, Anca M.; Benjamin, Daniel K.								MEDICAL REGULATION AND HEALTH OUTCOMES: THE EFFECT OF THE PHYSICIAN EXAMINATION REQUIREMENT								HEALTH ECONOMICS				22	4			393	409		10.1002/hec.2807			APR 2013	2013	This article investigates the effect on health outcomes of the regulation prohibiting physicians from prescribing drugs without a prior physical examination. This requirement could improve health by reducing illegal access to prescription drugs. However, it reduces access to health care by making it more difficult for patients and physicians to use many forms of telemedicine. Thus, this regulation generates a trade-off between access and safety. Using matching techniques, we find that the physician examination requirement leads to an increase of 1% in mortality rates from disease, the equivalent of 8.5 more deaths per 100,000 people, and a decrease of 6.7% in injury mortality, the equivalent of 2.5 deaths per 100,000 people. The magnitude of these effects is larger in rural areas and in areas with low physician density and is accompanied by an 18% increase in the number of days lost each month to illness.

We have previously reported on the development and characterization of a novel biomimetic acellular porcine NP (APNP) hydrogel. Herein, we aimed to evaluate this material for use as a suitable scaffold for NP tissue regeneration. Human-adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) were cultured for 14 days on APNP hydrogels in chemically defined differentiation media and were analyzed for an NP-cell-like mRNA expression profile, evidence of hydrogel remodeling including hydrogel contraction measurements, extracellular matrix production, and compressive dynamic mechanical properties. The innate capacity of the hydrogel itself to induce stem cell differentiation was also examined via culture in media lacking soluble differentiation factors. Additionally, the in vivo biocompatibility of non-crosslinked and ethyldimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide and pentagalloyl glucose crosslinked hydrogels was evaluated in a rat subdermal model. Results indicated that hADSCs expressed putative NP-cell-positive gene transcript markers when cultured on APNP hydrogels. Additionally, glycosaminoglycan and collagen content of hADSC-seeded hydrogels was significantly greater than nonseeded controls and cell-seeded hydrogels exhibited evidence of contraction and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-1 production. The dynamic mechanical properties of the hADSC-seeded hydrogels increased with time in culture in comparison to noncell-seeded controls and approached values reported for native NP tissue. Immunohistochemical analysis of explants illustrated the presence of mononuclear cells, including macrophages and fibroblasts, as well as blood vessel infiltration and collagen deposition within the implant interstices after 4 weeks of implantation. Taken together, these results suggest that APNP hydrogels, in concert with autologous ADSCs, may serve as a suitable scaffold for NP tissue regeneration.									15	2	0	10	0	17			1937-3341			WOS:000315951500013	23140227

Prairie Dog Aboveground Aggressive Behavior Towards Black-footed Ferrets								AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST				169	2			422	425					APR 2013	2013	Black-footed ferrets typically prey upon prairie dogs at night while prairie dogs are presumably sleeping. Prairie dogs can act aggressively towards aboveground ferrets in daylight and we observed prairie dog aggression towards ferrets four times in South Dakota and Montana. Ten behaviors by prairie dogs were recorded during aggressive interactions with ferrets including chasing, blocking, and physical contact. One of the aggressive prairie dogs was confirmed as an adult male and three of four encounters occurred Jun. through Jul. Interactions lasted <10 min and neither the prairie dog nor ferret were visibly injured.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0003-0031	1938-4238		WOS:000338206900015

However, factors such as energy harvesting variability and unpredictable network connectivity make building robust and perpetual systems difficult. In this paper, we present a system, Tula, that balances sensing with data delivery, to allow perpetual and robust operation across highly dynamic and mobile networks. This balance is especially important in unpredictable environments; sensing more data than can be delivered by the network is not useful, while gathering less underutilizes the system's potential. Tula is decentralized, fair and automatically adapts across different mobility patterns. We evaluate Tula using mobility and energy traces from TurtleNet-a mobile sensor network we deployed to study Gopher tortoises-and publicly available traces from the UMass DieselNet testbed. Our evaluations show that Tula senses and delivers data at up to 85 percent of an optimal, oracular system that perfectly replicates data and has foreknowledge of future energy harvesting. We also demonstrate that Tula can be implemented on a small microcontroller with modest code, memory, and processing requirements.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1536-1233	1558-0660		WOS:000314937300016

At its core is to prepare high performance TE nanocomposites, both p- and n-type, in a time and energy efficient way. To this end, we in this article summarize our recent effort and results on both p- and n-type Bi2Te3-based nanocomposites prepared by a unique single-element-melt-spinning spark-plasma sintering procedure. The results of transport measurements, scanning and transmission electronic microscopy, and small angle neutron scattering have proved essential in order to establish the correlation between the nanostructures and the TE performance of the materials. Interestingly, we find that in situ formed nanocrystals with coherent boundaries are the key nanostructures responsible for the significantly improved TE performance of p-type Bi2Te3 nanocomposites whereas similar nanostructures turn out to be less effective for n-type Bi2Te3 nanocomposites. We also discuss the alternative strategies to further improve the TE performance of n-type Bi2Te3 materials via nanostructuring processes.									28	0	0	1	0	28			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000313495200002

With this model, we were able to examine the influence of the Gouy-Chapman-Stern electrical double layer and the solution concentration on the ionic conductance in the device. Results showed that the conductance-concentration relationship predicted from our model agreed well with experimental observation. Moreover, our model showed that the compact layer thickness increased with the increase of the bulk solution concentration, reducing the internal volume of the nanotube channel available for fluid transport. Fluid within the channel had an enhanced concentration and a net charge which increased the electroosmotic and electrophoretic transport properties of the device, increasing the total ionic conductance of the system.									5	1	0	1	0	6			0957-4484			WOS:000315929400006	23466571

Alignment of fillers in composites with specific structures and morphologies has been widely pursued to achieve high performance based on taking advantage of unique filler characteristics. In this work, few-layer graphene (FLG), obtained from direct exfoliation of graphite, was fabricated into paraffin wax to prepare FLG/wax composites and investigate their electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding performance. The as-exfoliated FLG/wax samples have shown much improved EMI performance compared to the commercial graphite/wax ones. For further improvement of EMI shielding performance, split-press-merge approaches were applied to align the FLG fillers to achieve anisotropic characteristics in the plane perpendicular to the pressing direction. Much enhanced EMI shielding performance coupled with an improvement in absorption and reflection was observed in the post-alignment FLG/wax composites. An average interparticle distance model associated with improved electrically conducting interconnection and enlarged effective reflection regions with respect to enhanced reflection efficiency were discussed. The results suggest a platform and promising opportunities for preparing high-performance EMI shielding composites.									31	0	0	0	0	31			0957-4484			WOS:000315715300023	23455571

A binding of an ion to a protein greatly affects protein's biophysical characteristics and needs to be taken into account in any modeling approach. However, ion's bounded positions cannot be easily revealed experimentally, especially if they are loosely bound to macromolecular surface.Results: Here, we report a web server, the BION web server, which addresses the demand for tools of predicting surface bound ions, for which specific interactions are not crucial; thus, they are difficult to predict.

J	Watkins, Derrick; Norris, F. A.; Kumar, Sunil; Arya, Dev P.								A fluorescence-based screen for ribosome binding antibiotics								ANALYTICAL BIOCHEMISTRY				434	2			300	307		10.1016/j.ab.2012.12.003			MAR 15 2013	2013	The development of new antibacterial agents has become necessary to treat the large number of emerging bacterial strains resistant to current antibiotics. Despite the different methods of resistance developed by these new strains, the A-site of the bacterial ribosome remains an attractive target for new antibiotics. To develop new drugs that target the ribosomal A-site, a high-throughput screen is necessary to identify compounds that bind to the target with high affinity. To this end, we present an assay that uses a novel fluorescein-conjugated neomycin (F-neo) molecule as a binding probe to determine the relative binding affinity of a drug library. We show here that the binding of F-neo to a model Escherichia coli ribosomal A-site results in a large decrease in the fluorescence of the molecule. Furthermore, we have determined that the change in fluorescence is due to the relative change in the pK(a) of the probe resulting from the change in the electrostatic environment that occurs when the probe is taken from the solvent and localized into the negative potential of the A-site major groove. Finally, we demonstrate that F-neo can be used in a robust, highly reproducible assay, determined by a Z'-factor greater than 0.80 for 3 consecutive days. The assay is capable of rapidly determining the relative binding affinity of a compound library in a 96-well plate format using a single channel electronic pipette. The current assay format will be easily adaptable to a high-throughput format with the use of a liquid handling robot for large drug libraries currently available and under development.

Graphenes exhibited comparable or better adsorption capacities than carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and granular activated carbon (GAC) in the presence of NOM. The presence of NOM reduced the SOC uptake of all adsorbents. However, the impact of NOM on the SOC adsorption was smaller on graphenes than CNTs and activated carbons. Furthermore, the SOC with its flexible molecular structure was less impacted from NOM preloading than the SOC with planar and rigid molecular structure. The results indicated that graphenes can serve as alternative adsorbents for removing SOCs from water. However, they will also, if released to environment, adsorb organic contaminants influencing their fate and impact in the environment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The Importance of Continuous and Discrete Elements in Continuum Robots								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED ROBOTIC SYSTEMS				10						165	10.5772/55270			MAR 14 2013	2013	In this paper, we examine key issues underlying the design and operation of robots featuring continuous body ("continuum") elements. We contrast continuum and continuum-like robots created to date with their counterparts in the natural world. It is observed that natural continuum locomotors or manipulators almost invariably rely on hard or discrete elements (in their structure or operation) in their interactions with their environment. We suggest innovations in continuum robot design and operation motivated by this observation, supported by experiments using the "Tendril" continuum robot. The results suggest new ways in which continuum robot operations could be significantly enhanced. In particular, the exploitation of "hard" and "discrete" environmental features can greatly enhance stability in continuum robot operations, compensating for inherent backbone compliance. Additionally, the incorporation of discrete behaviours (sweeping and striking with the backbone) can both compensate for imprecision in continuum robot control and enable new impulsive manipulation modes. We discuss the implications for the creation and potential application of novel hybrid continuum and discrete robots.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1729-8806	1729-8814		WOS:000316553200003

We have shown that high-affinity CMG2 binders can inhibit angiogenesis and tumor growth. We recently described a high-throughput FRET assay to identify CMG2 inhibitors. We now report the serendipitous discovery that PGG (1,2,3,4,6-penta-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucopyranose) is a CMG2 inhibitor with antiangiogenic activity. PGG is a gallotannin produced by a variety of medicinal plants that exhibits a wide variety of antitumor and other activities. We find that PGG inhibits CMG2 with a submicromolar IC50 and it also inhibits the migration of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells at similar concentrations in vitro. Finally, oral or intraperitoneal administration of PGG inhibits angiogenesis in the mouse corneal micropocket assay in vivo. Together, these results suggest that a portion of the in vivo antitumor activity of PGG may be the result of antiangiogenic activity mediated by inhibition of CMG2.									5	0	0	3	0	5			0022-2623			WOS:000316308300013	23394144

As the molar ratio of aliphatic amines to iron precursor is increased, the average diameter of the synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles decreases. This trend is opposite to previously reported results. We investigated this phenomenon by independently varying the ligand chain length, the ligand-precursor molar ratio, and the degree of saturation of the aliphatic chain. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of the precursor illustrated the presence of a primary amine peak before heating and the peak absence after heating, potentially indicating that the primary amine acts as reducing agent to promote the decomposition of the iron precursor. We hypothesize that the amine groups play a dominant role in the nucleation of the particles, while the chain length and degree of aliphatic saturation have only a minor effect on particle size. The nanoparticles' size and crystallinity were characterized with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, and X-ray diffraction, and the magnetic properties were characterized by magnetometry.									10	1	0	0	0	10			1932-7447			WOS:000316308400059

To study the chemotaxonomy of Mangshanyegan, its volatile profiles of fruit and leaf and those of 29 other genotypes of Citrus, Poncirus, and Fortunella were subjected to phylogenetic analyses. Results showed that 145 identified (including 64 tentatively identified) and 15 unidentified volatile compounds were detected from their peel oils. The phylogenetic analysis of peel oils based on hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) demonstrated a good agreement with the Swingle taxonomy system, in which the three genera of Citrus, Poncirus, and Fortunella were almost completely separated. As to Citrus, HCA indicated that Citrophorum, Cephalocitrus, and Sinocitrus fell into three subgroups, respectively. Also, it revealed that Mangshanyegan contain volatile compounds similar to those from pummelo, though it is genetically believed to be a mandarin. These results were further supported by the principal component analysis of the peel oils and the HCA results of volatile profiles of leaves in the study.									9	0	0	7	0	9			1932-6203			WOS:000316849200066

Distinguishing the relative impacts of demography from selection requires a baseline of expressed gene variation in naturally occurring populations. Six nuclear genes were sequenced to estimate the patterns and levels of genetic diversity in natural Arabidopsis lyrata subsp. petraea populations that differ in demographic histories since the Pleistocene. As expected, northern European populations have genetic signatures of a strong population bottleneck likely due to glaciation during the Pleistocene. Levels of diversity in the northern populations are about half of that in central European populations. Bayesian estimates of historical population size changes indicate that central European populations also have signatures of population size change since the last glacial maxima, suggesting that these populations are not as stable as previously thought. Time since divergence amongst northern European populations is higher than amongst central European populations, suggesting that the northern European populations were established before the Pleistocene and survived glaciation in small separated refugia. Estimates of demography based on expressed genes are complementary to estimates based on microsatellites and transposable elements, elucidating temporal shifts in population dynamics and confirming the importance of marker selection for tests of demography.									3	0	0	3	0	3			1932-6203			WOS:000316252500056	23554957

In the single resonator, the optomechanical transduction sensitivity is determined by the optical and mechanical quality factors of the resonator. In the coupled resonators, the optomechanical transduction is related to the energy distribution in the two resonators, which is strongly dependent on the input detuning. Compared to a single resonator, the coupled resonators can still provide very sensitive optomechanical transduction even if the optical and mechanical quality factors of one resonator are degraded.

Adsorption data for 29 aromatic compounds from literature (i.e., the training data) including some of the experimental results obtained in our laboratory were used to develop predictive models with multiple linear regression analysis. The generated QSAR (r(2) = 0.88), and LSER (r(2) = 0.83) equations were validated externally using an independent validation data set of 30 aromatic compounds. External validation accuracies indicated the success of parameter selection, data fitting ability, and the prediction strength of the developed models. Finally, the combination of training and validation data were used to obtain a combined LSER equation (r(2) = 0.83) that would be used for predicting adsorption of a wide range of low molecular weight aromatics by MWCNTs. In addition, LSER models at different concentrations were generated, and LSER parameter coefficients were examined to gain insights to the predominant adsorption interactions of low molecular weight aromatics on MWCNTs. The molecular volume term (V) of the LSER model was the most influential descriptor controlling adsorption at all concentrations. At higher equilibrium concentrations, hydrogen bond donating (A) and hydrogen bond accepting (B) terms became significant in the models. The results demonstrate that successful predictive models can be developed for the adsorption of organic compounds by CNTs using QSAR and LSER techniques.									24	3	0	15	0	26			0013-936X			WOS:000315844200021	22747100

Qualitative developmental research among low income African American adults to inform a social marketing campaign for walking								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY				10						33	10.1186/1479-5868-10-33			MAR 5 2013	2013	Background: This study describes the development of a social marketing campaign for increasing walking in a low income, high crime community as part of the Positive Action for Today's Health (PATH) trial.Methods: Focus groups were conducted with 52 African American adults (ages 18 to 65 yrs), from two underserved communities to develop themes for a social marketing campaign to promote walking. Participants responded to questions concerning social marketing principles related to product, price, place, promotion, and positioning for increasing neighbourhood walking.Results: Focus group data informed the development of the campaign objectives that were derived from the "5 Ps" to promote physical and mental health, social connectedness, safety, and confidence in walking regularly. Focus group themes indicated that physical and mental health benefits of walking were important motivators. Walking for social reasons was also important for overcoming barriers to walking. Police support from trusted officers while walking was also essential to promoting safety for walking. Print materials were developed by the steering committee, with a 12-month calendar and door hangers delivered to residents' homes to invite them to walk. Pride Stride walks empowered community walkers to serve as peer leaders for special walking events to engage new walkers.Conclusions: Essential elements for developing culturally tailored social marketing interventions for promoting walking in underserved communities are outlined for future researchers.									6	0	0	2	0	6			1479-5868			WOS:000317034400001	23497164

Mechanical and barrier properties of the coated films were evaluated according to clay type and concentration. PLA films coated by ink formulations containing Cloisite 30B displayed the best mechanical and barrier properties in six types of nanoclays. PLA films coated by Cloisite 30B-containing ink varying in clay concentration were investigated. Tensile strength and elongation at break of these coated films were improved in 1% Cloisite 30B. Oxygen permeability decreased significantly upon the addition of clay levels up to 1% and slightly decreased with further increases in the amount of the clay. The value of water vapor permeability also decreased depending on the increases of clay (0%20%). When the clay content in the sample was 2.0%, the surface of coated PLA films displayed aggregation visible using film emission scanning electron microscopy. X-ray diffractometry and transmission electron microscopy indicated that a mixture of exfoliated and intercalated structure was formed with addition of 1% (w/w) Cloisite 30B to the ink after ultrasonication.

Structured interviews incorporating both forced choice and free response questions were administered to the volunteers-healthcare providers and patients at a rehabilitation hospital.RESULTS: While the overbed tabletop and extendable tray are heavily used, all other features of the overbed table models are rarely used. Usability of the models exhibits the potential for improvement. Healthcare providers' and patients' feature preferences differ and occasionally conflict.CONCLUSIONS: Existing overbed tables are valued primarily for the top surface. Other features and functions of the overbed table present opportunities for refinement of design, durability, and usability. There are strong patterns of agreement and disagreement in the preferences of healthcare providers and patients with respect to overbed table design, use, features, and functionality. There is potential to improve overbed table designs from both the perspectives of the staff and the patient.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1937-5867	2167-5112		WOS:000340929500003	23817904

We first show that for the Taylor-Green vortex decay problem, NSV admits an exact solution which evolves slower than true fluid flow. Secondly, we show numerically for a channel flow test problem using standard discretisation methods that although NSV provides more regular solutions compared to usual Navier-Stokes solutions, NSV approximations take significantly longer to reach the steady state.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1061-8562			WOS:000320183100005

The FEM simulations replicate atomic force microscopy (AFM) nanoindentation experiments on live vascular smooth muscle cells. Individual cells are characterized mechanically with AFM and then imaged in 3D using a spinning disc confocal microscope. Using these images, geometries for the FEM are automatically generated via image segmentation and linear programming algorithms. The geometries consist of independent structures representing the nucleus, actin stress fiber network, and cytoplasm. These are imported into commercial software for mesh refinement and analysis. The FEM presented here is capable of predicting AFM results well for 500 nm indentations. The FEM results are relatively insensitive to both the exact number and diameter of fibers used. Despite the localized nature of AFM nanoindentation, the model predicts that stresses are distributed in an anisotropic manner throughout the cell body via the actin stress fibers. This pattern of stress distribution is likely a result of the geometric arrangement of the actin network.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0090-6964			WOS:000316295800016	23180027

Our research aims to combine our software interface designed for high usability with multimodal hardware configurations and to evaluate these systems to determine their user performance benefits and user acceptance data. We present two multimodal systems for using a novel system-directed interface to aid in inspecting vehicles along the assembly line: (1) wearable monocular display with speech input and audio output and (2) large screen display with speech input and audio output. We conducted two evaluations: (a) an experimental evaluation with novice users, resulting in accuracy, timing, user preferences, and other performance results and (b) an expert-based usability evaluation conducted on and off the assembly line providing insight on user acceptance, preferences, and performance potential in the production environment. We also compared these systems to current technology used in the production environment: a handheld display without speech input/output. Our results show that for visual and tactile tasks, benefits of system-directed interfaces are best realized when used with multimodal systems that reduce visual and tactile interaction per item and instead deliver system-directed information on the audio channel. Interface designers that combine system-directed interfaces with multimodal systems can expect faster and more efficient user performance when the delivery channel is different from channels necessary for task completion.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1530-9827	1944-7078		WOS:000326185000002

In doing so, it presents the algorithms to perform those reasoning, provides justification for the reasoning, and presents a software implementation called Concept Modeler (ConMod) to demonstrate the reasoning. Specifically, the representation is shown to support constructing function structure graphs in a grammar-controlled manner so that logical and physics-based inconsistencies are prevented in real-time, thus ensuring logically consistent models. Further, it is demonstrated that the representation can support post-modeling reasoning to check the modeled concepts against two universal principles of physics: the balance laws of mass and energy, and the principle of irreversibility. The representation in question is recently published and its internal ontological and logical consistency has been already demonstrated. However, its ability to support the intended reasoning was not validated so far, which is accomplished in this paper.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1530-9827	1944-7078		WOS:000326185000008

In this approach, real-time wide-area measurement data are processed and utilized to design a set of stability agents based on a Reinforcement Learning (RL) method. Recent technological breakthroughs in wide-area measurement system (WAMS) make the use of the system-wide signals possible in designing power system controllers. The main design objectives of these controllers are to stabilize the system after severe disturbances and mitigate the oscillations afterward. The proposed stability agents are decentralized and autonomous. The proposed method extends the stability boundary of the system and achieves the above goals without losing any generator or load area and without any knowledge of the disturbances causing the response. This paper describes the developed framework and addresses different challenges in designing such a network. A case study is provided to illustrate and verify the performance and robustness of the proposed approach.									5	1	0	0	0	6			1949-3053			WOS:000325485600053

Intelligent Local Area Signals Based Damping of Power System Oscillations Using Virtual Generators and Approximate Dynamic Programming								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SMART GRID				4	1			498	508		10.1109/TSG.2012.2233224			MAR 2013	2013	This paper illustrates the development of an intelligent local area signals based controller for damping low-frequency oscillations in power systems. The controller is trained offline to perform well under a wide variety of power system operating points, allowing it to handle the complex, stochastic, and time-varying nature of power systems. Neural network based system identification eliminates the need to develop accurate models from first principles for control design, resulting in a methodology that is completely data driven. The virtual generator concept is used to generate simplified representations of the power system online using time-synchronized signals from phasor measurement units at generating stations within an area of the system. These representations improve scalability by reducing the complexity of the system "seen" by the controller and by allowing it to treat a group of several synchronous machines at distant locations from each other as a single unit for damping control purposes. A reinforcement learning mechanism for approximate dynamic programming allows the controller to approach optimality as it gains experience through interactions with simulations of the system. Results obtained on the 68-bus New England/New York benchmark system demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in damping low-frequency inter-area oscillations without additional control effort.									38	1	0	1	0	38			1949-3053			WOS:000325485600054		
J	Fisher, Murray; Atamturktur, Sez; Khan, Abdul A.								A novel vibration-based monitoring technique for bridge pier and abutment scour								STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL				12	2			114	125		10.1177/1475921713476332			MAR 2013	2013	Scouring degrades the overall health of a bridge by removing the bed material surrounding the piers and abutments. If undetected, scour may lead to the catastrophic failure of a bridge resulting in hundreds of millions in repair costs. The loss of a bridge due to undetected scour formations can also hinder emergency evacuations since riverbed scouring typically occurs in peak flow periods such as hurricane or flood events. To take requisite precautions against such catastrophic events, a monitoring system that can reliably detect scour formation, without being adversely affected by the environmental conditions, is essential. This article presents a novel scour monitoring technique that exploits the differences between the low-frequency ambient excitations exerted on a thin, flexible plate located in the flow versus the same device located in the sediment. The underlying principle is that a flexible plate excited by the turbulent flow vibrates at significantly higher amplitudes compared to an identical plate surrounded by sediment. To validate this principle, a simplified numerical model is developed to guide the design of the scaled laboratory device; next, a prototype model is built in the laboratory and tested in an indoor flume. The energy content of the sensor in the flow is measured to be one to two orders of magnitude greater than the sensor in sediment. The findings obtained at various flow conditions indicate that this technique can supply reliable information on the water/sediment interface, and thus scour and refill processes. Experimental results also demonstrate that the presence of a scour hole further improves the ability to detect the interface location. Additionally, the results show that maximum slope of the sensor energy content as a function of the sensor depth can be used as a feature to estimate the water/sediment interface.									8	0	0	0	0	8			1475-9217	1741-3168		WOS:000325822000002

J	Wang, Eric T. G.; Tai, Jeffrey C. F.; Grover, Varun								EXAMINING THE RELATIONAL BENEFITS OF IMPROVED INTERFIRM INFORMATION PROCESSING CAPABILITY IN BUYER-SUPPLIER DYADS								MIS QUARTERLY				37	1			149	+					MAR 2013	2013	Information Systems research has studied how buyers and suppliers can benefit from improved information visibility in supply chains characterized by uncertainty. However, the relation-specific information processing solutions that provide visibility can only be exploited if the two firms engage in sufficient coordination efforts. This work takes a nuanced look at how dyadic benefits are derived in the supply chain. Drawing on the information processing view, resource-based view, and transaction cost theory, this study explicates how buyer performance can result from buyer's use of relation-specific information processing solutions and supplier's relational responses. Two interfirm information processing solutions are proposed and examined: the use of IT-based systems for planning and control, and the use of relational (normative) contracts. Based on a sample of 144 manufacturing firms, eight of the nine proposed research hypotheses receive empirical support using PLS analysis. The findings suggest that as buyers and suppliers utilize the IT and relational solutions, they induce relation-specific responses represented as supplier's business process investments and modification flexibility, which in turn lead to positive buyer outcomes. The results help us gain a more granular understanding on how relation-specific interfirm information processing solutions can lead to performance through enhanced interfirm governance capabilities.									20	0	0	0	1	21			0276-7783			WOS:000321340500007

Effects of forage species or concentrate finishing on animal performance, carcass and meat quality								JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE				91	3			1454	1467		10.2527/jas2012-5914			MAR 2013	2013	Angus-cross steers (n = 128; initial BW = 270 +/- 3.8 kg) were used in a 3-yr study to assess effects of forage species grazed before slaughter versus concentrate finishing on carcass and meat quality. At the completion of the stockering phase, steers were randomly allotted to mixed pasture (MP; n = 36/yr) or corn-silage concentrate (CON; n = 12/yr) finishing treatments. At 40 d before harvest, MP steers were randomly divided into 3 forage species treatments: alfalfa (AL), pearl millet (PM), or mixed pasture (MP). Average daily BW gain was greater (P = 0.001) for CON than for forage-finished (FOR) steers during the early and overall finishing phase. During the late finishing phase when FOR steers were grazing difference forage species, ADG was greater (P = 0.03) for PM than MP or AL. Harvest weight and HCW were greater (P < 0.001) for CON than FOR due to the differences in animal performance. Total fat percentage of the 9th to 11th rib section was 46% less(P = 0.028) for FOR than CON due to reductions (P < 0.001) in the percentage of subcutaneous fat. Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBS) values at 14 d and 28 d of aging did not differ (P > 0.78) between CON and FOR and were not altered (P > 0.40) by forage species. Trained sensory panel juiciness, initial tenderness, and overall tenderness scores did not differ (P > 0.17) by finishing treatment or forage species. Beef flavor intensity was greater (P < 0.001) for CON than FOR. Beef flavor intensity was greater (P < 0.02) for AL and PM than MP. Off-flavor intensity was greater (P < 0.001) for all forage-fed steaks, regardless of forage species, than CON. Finishing on forages reduced (P = 0.003) total lipid content by 61% for the LM compared with CON finished cattle. Forage species grazed before harvest did not alter (P > 0.05) total lipid content of the LM. Oleic acid concentration and total MUFA of the LM were 21% and 22% less (P = 0.001) for FOR than CON. Concentrations of all individual [ linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic (EPA), docosapentaenoic (DPA), and docosadexaenoic (DHA) acids] and total n-3 fatty acids were greater (P < 0.001) for FOR than CON. Finishing on AL increased (P = 0.017) the concentration of linolenic acid compared with MP or PM. The ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids was greater (P = 0.001) for CON than FOR and did not differ (P = 0.88) by forage species. Concentrate finishing increases carcass weight with same time endpoints and accelerates deposition of MUFA in comparison with FOR, which reduces carcass weight and fat deposition but maintains high concentrations of n-3 and CLA fatty acids. Finishing system or forage species grazed 40 d before slaughter did not alter beef tenderness but FOR had greater off-flavors according to both trained and descriptive sensory panelists.									21	0	0	18	1	21			0021-8812			WOS:000319691500045	23345568

A Dispatching Model for Server-to-Customer Systems That Balances Efficiency and Equity								M&SOM-MANUFACTURING & SERVICE OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT				15	2			205	220		10.1287/msom.1120.0411			SPR 2013	2013	The decision about which servers to dispatch to which customers is an important aspect of service systems. This decision is complicated when servers must be equitably-as well as efficiently-dispatched to customers. In this paper, we formulate a model for determining how to optimally dispatch distinguishable servers to prioritized customers given a set of equity constraints. These issues are examined through the lens of emergency medical service (EMS) dispatch, for which a Markov decision process model is developed that captures how to dispatch ambulances (servers) to prioritized patients (customers). It is assumed that customers arrive sequentially, with the priority and location of each customer becoming known upon arrival. Four types of equity constraints are considered-two of which reflect customer equity and two of which reflect server equity-all of which draw upon the decision analytic and social science literature to compare the effects of different notions of equity on the resulting dispatching policies. The Markov decision processes are formulated as equity-constrained linear programming models. A computational example is applied to an EMS system to compare the different equity models.									10	0	0	0	1	11			1523-4614			WOS:000318558700004		
J	Slack, Trever Z.; Murdoch, Lawrence C.; Germanovich, Leonid N.; Hisz, David B.								Reverse water-level change during interference slug tests in fractured rock								WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH				49	3			1552	1567		10.1002/wrcr.20095			MAR 2013	2013	Reverse water-level responses in monitoring wells are widely known during pumping tests, where they are recognized as the Noordbergum or Rhade effects, and a similar response was observed in many of the 100+ interference slug tests conducted at a well field near Clemson, South Carolina. The reverse water-level effect is characterized by a drop in pressure head by 1 cm to several centimeters and it occurs in the first 10-100 s of the test. The reverse response is followed by a rise and fall of pressure head that is typical of slug-in tests. The reverse water-level response is highly repeatable, and it increases when the pressure used to create the slug test is increased. A conceptual model recognizes that opening displacement of the fracture wall can cause a pressure drop, even when the pressure increases in the wellbore. The conceptual model is supported by a closed-form, analytical solution and a numerical model that couple fluid pressure and deformation in a fracture. Characteristics of the reverse water-level response are sensitive to properties of the fracture system and enveloping formation. Parameter estimation methods can be used to invert theoretical analyses and use the reverse response to improve the characterization of fractured rock aquifers. Citation: Slack, T. Z., L. C.

Daily Survival Rate for Nests and Chicks of Least Terns (Sternula antillarum) at Natural Nest Sites in South Carolina								WATERBIRDS				36	1			1	10					MAR 2013	2013	Although a species of conservation concern, little is known about the reproductive success of Least Terns (Sternula antillarum) throughout the southeastern USA where availability of natural beaches for nesting is limited. Daily survival rate (DSR) of nests and chicks was examined at four natural nesting sites in Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge, South Carolina, 2009-2010. Measures of nest success (n = 257 nests) ranged from 0-93% among colony sites. The DSR of nests was primarily related to colony site, but year and estimates of predation risk also were related to DSR. Predation was the principal cause of identifiable nest loss, accounting for 47% of nest failures when the two years of data were pooled. The probability (+/- SE) of a chick surviving from hatching to fledging = 0.449 +/- 0.01 (n = 92 chicks). DSR of chicks was negatively related to tide height and rainfall. Therefore, productivity of Least Terns is being lost during both the nesting and chick stage through a combination of biotic and abiotic factors that may prove difficult to fully mitigate or manage. Although natural nesting sites within Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge intermittently produce successful nests, the consistency of productivity over the long term is still unknown. Given that the long term availability of anthropogenic nest sites (e.g., rooftops, dredge-spoil islands) for Least Terns is questionable, further research is required both locally and throughout the region to assess the extent to which natural sites act as population sources or sinks.

Their transparency, combined with tailorable thermo-mechanical properties, makes them ideal candidates for various optic applications. Extrinsic impurities within the glass matrix can impede their integration in components where low optical loss is a requirement. Additionally, chalcogenide materials typically exhibit low mechanical strength due to the comparatively weaker average bond strength of constituents. Here, we report findings of efforts to explore various purification methods on As2Se3 glasses to improve their optical and mechanical properties. These methods involve oxides removal by thermal treatment of the reagents, and addition of AlCl3 impurity-getters in the melt followed by distillation. We show that these techniques yield very effective results on the removal of hydroxyls, water, and oxide impurities. We also observe a recurrent increase in the Se-H vibrational band, with the concentration of the Se-H species escalating to several tens-of-ppm, depending on the purification method. These increases are associated with the preferential dissociation of hydrogen-containing species. Investigations of the structural, thermal, and mechanical properties of the glass were compared as a function of purification method, and the influence of impurity content on these material attributes is presented.									9	2	0	0	0	10			2041-1286			WOS:000316631000005

With Their Help: How community members construct a congruent Third Space in an urban kindergarten classroom								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION				35	5			837	863		10.1080/09500693.2011.582521			MAR 1 2013	2013	Through the use of narrative enquiry, this paper tells the story of how a kindergarten teacher in an all-girls' school incorporates family and community members' involvement to the construction of the congruent Third Space present in the classroom, and the ways the girls respond to this involvement, thereby providing a successful model for other schools in marginalized communities. In this study, the author sought to understand how this teacher and the community members' in this classroom create a congruent Third Space. This research enquiry includes the systematic use of the methodology portraiture with analysis of critical events. The portraits are titled: Mutual Desire for the Girls to Succeed and Community Members' Involvement.

J	Heiliger, C.; Kaye, N. B.; Testik, F. Y.					Kaye, Nigel/0000-0001-7190-7791			A computational study of the role of particle size standard deviation on the collision frequency in differential settling								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH				28	1			34	45					MAR 2013	2013	The results of a simple computational model for differential settling are presented illustrating the significant role that particle size distribution plays in collision frequency and sedimentation rate of particles in a quiescent environment. The model tracks a large number of particles (order 10(5)) with log-normally distributed diameters, as they settle at their Stokes settling velocities. Particle collisions are detected and result in larger particles that fall more rapidly. A number of simplifying assumptions are made in the model in order to avoid empirical correlations for phenomena such as collision efficiency and particle shape. These simplifying assumptions were needed to isolate and quantify the role of the particle size distribution. Simulated concentration profiles indicate that, even in the absence of collisions, the standard deviation (sigma(D)) of the particle size strongly influences the bulk mass settling rate as, for larger sigma(D), more mass is concentrated in larger, faster falling particles. The collision frequency is also a strong function of sigma(D). For a given mass concentration the collision frequency first increases linearly with increasing sigma(D) as greater variation in particle size leads to greater variation in particle velocity, and shorter times for particles to catch each other. For larger sigma(D) more mass is concentrated in larger particles, so, for a given mass concentration, there are fewer particles per unit volume, increasing the mean distance between the particles and reducing the collision frequency. The implications of these results for sedimentation measurement using optical attenuation techniques are discussed.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1001-6279			WOS:000316807700004

The aim of this work was to assess the performance of LES in modelling turbulent thermal plumes in a naturally ventilated enclosure and to analyse their interaction with each other. The sub-grid scales of the flow have been resolved by using the Smagorinsky sub-grid scale model. It was found that LES results for the interface height agree well with the theoretical predictions of Linden and Kaye (2006). However, instead of a step change in temperature, as suggested by theory, there exists a more diffuse interface. The merging height of the two plumes and the volume flow rates in the far field merged plume agreed closely with theoretical predictions. Analysis of the pressure isosurfaces demonstrated the interaction phenomena of the two plumes, the coherent structures and the behaviour of the interface.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1473-3315			WOS:000316641300003

Based on the covariates measured on all individuals in every group, we propose a local likelihood estimator of the prevalence probability as a function of the covariate. We show that the proposed estimator has an asymptotic normal distribution. Finite sample performance of the method is exhibited via some simulated examples and a real data analysis.									4	0	0	3	0	4			1048-5252			WOS:000316668200012

Due to their unique characteristics, micro- and nanomaterials were hypothesized to play a critical role in enhancing the performance behavior of asphalt binders. In light of existing research, carbon micro-fiber (MCF) and Nanomer I.44P (NI.44P) were selected as the micro- and nanomaterials for this research. Then, these materials were added into the PG 58-34 control asphalt binder at the concentrations of 2% and 4% by weight. Superpave (TM) binder tests rotational viscosity (RV), dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), and bending beam rheometer (BBR) were then conducted for evaluating the performance of each modified asphalt binder. Also, the characterization tests were run on the aged samples prepared using the rolling thin film oven (RTFO) and pressure aging vessel (PAV) to simulate the short-term and long-term aging. Subsequently, the viscosity, dynamic shear modulus (vertical bar G*vertical bar) and phase angle (delta) of asphalt binders were analyzed, and the dissipated energy per load cycle was introduced to estimate the asphalt binders' rutting and fatigue cracking resistance. It was found that the dynamic shear modulus of asphalt binders can be improved by the selected micro- and nanomaterials. Furthermore, the NI.44P modified asphalt showed better properties relative to the other modified asphalt binders or the control (PG 58-34) binder.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0090-3973	1945-7553		WOS:000316837800012

MiR319 expression is regulated by environmental stimuli, suggesting its involvement in plant stress response, although experimental evidence is lacking and the underlying mechanism remains elusive. This study investigates the role that miR319 plays in the plant response to abiotic stress using transgenic creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera) overexpressing a rice (Oryza sativa) miR319 gene, Osa-miR319a. We found that transgenic plants overexpressing Osa-miR319a displayed morphological changes and exhibited enhanced drought and salt tolerance associated with increased leaf wax content and water retention but reduced sodium uptake. Gene expression analysis indicated that at least four putative miR319 target genes, AsPCF5, AsPCF6, AsPCF8, and AsTCP14, and a homolog of the rice NAC domain gene AsNAC60 were down-regulated in transgenic plants. Our results demonstrate that miR319 controls plant responses to drought and salinity stress. The enhanced abiotic stress tolerance in transgenic plants is related to significant down-regulation of miR319 target genes, implying their potential for use in the development of novel molecular strategies to genetically engineer crop species for enhanced resistance to environmental stress.									65	9	0	62	1	74			0032-0889			WOS:000316984100026	23292790

Fluorescence microscopy and image analysis are used to quantitatively characterize bubble formation, morphology, and mobility. Observations indicate the strong influence of interfacial tension and pore-geometry on bubble growth and evolution. Most of the gas exhibits little mobility during the course of depressurization and clogs water flow paths. However, a snap-off mechanism mobilizes a small portion of the trapped gas along the water flow paths. This feature contributes to the transport of the dispersed exsolved gas phase and the formation of intermittent gas flow. A new definition of critical gas saturation is proposed accordingly as the minimum saturation that snap-off starts to produce mobile bubbles. Low mobility of the water phase and CO2 phase in exsolution is explained by formation of dispersed CO2 bubbles which block water flow and lack the connectivity to create a mobile gas phase.

However, Joule heating may become an issue in iDEP microdevices due to the local amplification of electric field around the insulators. This results in an electrothermal force that can manifest itself in the flow field in the form of circulations, thus affecting the particle motion. We develop herein a transient, 3D, full-scale numerical model to study Joule heating and its effects on the coupled transport of charge, heat, and fluid in an iDEP device with a rectangular constriction microchannel. This model is validated by comparing the simulation results with the experimentally obtained fluid flow patterns and particle images that were reported in our recent works. It identifies a significant difference in the time scales of the electric, temperature, and flow fields in iDEP microdevices. It also predicts the locations of electrothermal flow circulations in different halves of the channel at the upstream and downstream of the constriction.									14	0	0	8	0	14			0173-0835			WOS:000316267100008	23192532

A resistancecapacitance electro-thermal model is used to couple the experimental boundary conditions (current, voltage, state of charge, and temperature) with the modeled battery resistance to capture its electro-chemical behavior and the cell exothermic reactions. Battery current, voltage, and temperature (discrete and full field) for a vehicle with a power-split hybrid configuration were collected under different standard (Federal Highway Driving Schedule and Federal Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (FUDS)) and artificially generated driving cycles. This manuscript analyzes the battery current and voltage in relation to vehicle speed and shows how the proposed FD model predicts the spatial and temporal temperature profiles of the power train in good agreement with the vehicle data as reported by the on-board diagnostics module.

These real wage series are the first continuous and consistent indicator of changing living standards in this part of Europe during industrialization. They show that while the living standards stagnated throughout the monarchy prior to 1850s, the West ( unlike the East) was able to launch onto a path of continuous growth in the second half of the century. The empire experienced little convergence onto the living standards of its neighbors and even internally the convergence record is mixed.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0022-0507			WOS:000316195100001

Because of the uncertainties originating from the poorly known soil parameters, the imperfect analysis model, and other factors such as construction variability, the soil parameters can only be inferred as probability distributions. In this paper, these posterior distributions are derived using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling method implemented with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. In the proposed framework, Bayesian updating is first realized with one type of response observation (maximum wall deflection or maximum settlement), and then this Bayesian framework is extended to allow for simultaneous use of two types of response observations in the updating.

An intrinsic grain boundary with no apparent impurity segregation was observed in an undoped TiO2 bicrystal. In a WO3-doped TiO2 bicrystal, WO3 second-phase particles formed along the boundary, with a nominally clean, intrinsic-type grain boundary in between the particles. In a CuO-doped bicrystal, a remarkable series of three distinct grain boundary complexions with abrupt structural transitions was discovered coexisting at the grain boundary, and the existence of a fourth equilibrium complexion at the annealing temperature was implied. Thus, the WO3- and CuO-doped TiO2 bicrystals exhibit dramatically different solute partitioning behavior which can be understood in terms of the relative interphase boundary energies of these two systems. STEM electron energy loss spectroscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis of the nanoscale lens-shaped films of amorphous material in the CuO-doped TiO2 bicrystal demonstrated an excess of CuO, as expected, yet also revealed the unintentional presence of SiOx. The multiple grain boundary complexions in CuO-doped TiO2 offer an explanation for the CuO-enhanced grain growth and sintering of TiO2 that has been reported in the literature. Conversely, the intrinsic grain boundary complexion observed in WO3-doped TiO2 is consistent with previous work showing that WO3 has no effect on grain boundary mobility in TiO2. A phenomenological thermodynamic model is proposed to explain the physical origin of these observed grain boundary complexions and the abrupt, first-order complexion transitions that are believed to occur upon cooling of the CuO-doped TiO2 bicrystal.

These wetlands are threatened due to climate change, sea level rise, and coastal urban development. Understanding the natural biogeochemical cycles of nutrients in these forested wetlands as ecosystems services such as carbon sequestration and nitrogen processing can provide important benchmarks to guide conservation plans and restoration goals. In this study, surface water and soil pore water samples were collected weekly from a cypress-tupelo wetland near Winyah Bay, South Carolina and analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), inorganic nitrogen, and phosphate during its flooding period between October 2010 and May 2011. DOC was further characterized by specific ultra-violet absorbance at 254 nm, spectral slope ratio (S-R) (ratio of two spectral slopes between 275-295 nm and 350-400 nm), E2/E3 ratio (ratio between A254 and A365), and fluorescence excitation-emission matrix. In addition, litterfall was collected on a monthly basis for a year while the biomass of the detritus layer (i.e., decomposed duff lying on the wetland floor) was determined before and after the flooding period. Results of the field study showed that concentrations of DOC, DON, NH4 (+)-N, and (NO2 (-) + NO3 (-))-N in the surface water were generally higher during the fall, or peak litterfall season (October to December), than in the spring season (March to May). Highest concentrations of 54.8, 1.48, 0.270, and 0.0205 mg L-1, for DOC, DON, NH4 (+)-N, and (NO2 (-) + NO3 (-))-N respectively, in surface waters were recorded during October. Lower SUVA, but higher S-R and E2/E3 ratios of DOC, were observed at the end of the flooding season comparing to the initial flooding, suggesting the wetland system converts high aromatic and large DOC molecules into smaller and hydrophilic fractions possibly through photochemical oxidation. A similar trend was observed in soil pore water, but the pore water generally had greater and relatively stable concentrations of dissolved nutrients than surface water. No obvious temporal trend in phosphate concentration and total nitrogen to total phosphorus ratio (N:P) were found. Results of the laboratory extraction and mass balance calculation suggested fresh litter was a major source of DOC whereas decomposed duff was the source of dissolved nitrogen in surface water. In summary, the biogeochemistry of this isolated cypress-tupelo wetland is not only driven by the vegetation within the wetland system but also by hydrology and weather conditions such as groundwater table position, precipitation, and temperature.					4th Conference on the Mechanisms of Organic Matter Stabilization and Destabilization (SOM) - Organic Matter Stabilization and Ecosystem Functions4th Conference on the Mechanisms of Organic Matter Stabilization and Destabilization (SOM) - Organic Matter Stabilization and Ecosystem Functions	SEP 19-23, 2010SEP 19-23, 2010	Bioemco Lab (Biogeochemistry and Ecol Continental Ecosystems), Soil Organ Matter GrpBioemco Lab (Biogeochemistry and Ecol Continental Ecosystems), Soil Organ Matter Grp	FRANCEFRANCE	17	1	0	17	0	20			0168-2563			WOS:000316018800038

A growing body of evidence has suggested that exogenous cell transplantation is one promising strategy to promote remyelination. However, direct injection of neural stem cells or oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) to the lesion site may not be an optimal therapeutic strategy due to poor viability and functionality of transplanted cells resulted from the local hostile tissue environment. The overall objective of this study was to engineer an injectable biocompatible hydrogel system as a supportive niche to provide a regeneration permissive microenvironment for transplanted OPCs to survive, functionally differentiate, and remyelinate central nervous system (CNS) lesions. A highly biocompatible hydrogel, based on thiol-functionalized hyaluronic acid and thiol-functionalized gelatin, which can be crosslinked by poly-(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA), was used. These hydrogels were optimized first regarding cell adhesive properties and mechanical properties to best support the growth properties of OPCs in culture. Transplanted OPCs with the hydrogels optimized in vitro exhibited enhanced survival and oligodendrogenic differentiation and were able to remyelinate demyelinated axons inside ethidium bromide (EB) demyelination lesion in adult spinal cord. This study provides a new possible therapeutic approach to treat CNS injuries in which cell therapies may be essential.-Li, X., Liu, X., Cui, L., Brunson, C., Zhao, W., Bhat, N.

The technique was used to quantify the rate of removal of aggregate from a two-dimensional building as a function of the building parapet height and the wind speed. The experimental results indicate that the mass flux varies over time. Initially the mass flux is quite high, and there is significant movement of aggregate within the roof cavity formed by the parapet. After this initial adjustment, the mass flux reduces by a factor of four and then remains steady. The adjustment time was found to be independent of the parapet height but strongly dependent on the wind speed. This suggests that the primary role of the parapet is to prevent removal of aggregate from the roof cavity, but that parapets are less effective at preventing aggregate motion within the roof cavity. Increasing the parapet height significantly reduces the mass flux. A parapet height equal to 15% of the building height reduces the blow-off rate by a factor of 100 compared to a roof without a parapet. Further, the addition of a parapet always reduced the mass flux. This stands in contrast to studies of the wind speeds required to initiate motion in which small parapets have been observed to reduce the critical wind speed required to initiate blow-off. Although the experiments were run at relatively small scale, the results were not significantly influenced by viscosity, indicating that small scale wind tunnel studies of mass blow-off rate may, with care, be scaled up to full-size buildings. Again this is in contrast to blow-off initiation studies, in which the wind speed required to start mass removal is strongly dependent on the Reynolds number, and only full scale experimental results should be used in design.

"Food Changed My Life": The Chef Jeff Project and the Politics of Rehabilitative Cooking								CRITICAL STUDIES IN MEDIA COMMUNICATION				30	1			34	51		10.1080/15295036.2012.693939			MAR 1 2013	2013	As one of the most popular entertainment genres in the US, food media continues to attract significant attention from communication and cultural critics. In an effort to complicate conversations regarding the relationship among food media, identity construction, and power, this paper examines Food Network's reality-based series, The Chef Jeff Project (TCJP). TCJP is a seemingly groundbreaking series featuring ex-con turned chef Jeff Henderson who attempts to change the lives of at risk youth through the power of food. We argue that, despite its altruistic appearance, TCJP appropriates normative politics surrounding kitchen culture, good taste, and food service in ways that reinforce participants' Otherness, the privileged normalcy of their clientele, and the viewing audience. We argue that TCJP represents the evolving subgenre rehabilitative cooking, a form of makeover media that aims to normalize so-called at-risk subjects through highly supervised unpaid (or underpaid) culinary labor under the guise of philanthropy.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1529-5036			WOS:000315439000003		
J	Dang, Viet D.; Walters, David M.; Lee, Cindy M.								Assessing ongoing sources of dissolved-phase polychlorinated biphenyls in a contaminated stream								ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY				32	3			535	540		10.1002/etc.2106			MAR 2013	2013	Few studies assess the potential of ongoing sources of fresh polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) to aquatic systems when direct discharge to the environment has been eliminated. In the present study, the authors used single-layered, low-density polyethylene samplers (PEs) to measure total PCB concentrations, congener profiles, and enantiomeric fractions (EFs) in a contaminated stream and to provide multiple lines of evidence for assessing ongoing inputs of PCB. Concentrations were well above background levels that have been monitored for years. Concentrations significantly increased with distance, the farthest downstream PE concentrations being almost five times greater than those at 79m downstream of a historical point source. The PCBs in the PEs at 79m downstream of the contamination source were dominated by low KOW congeners, similar to those in the mixture of Aroclors 1016 and 1254 (4:1v/v) historically released from the former capacitor manufacturer. The only two chiral congeners detected in the PEs downstream were PCBs 91 and 95. The EF values were nonracemic for PCB 91, while the values were either racemic or near racemic for PCB 95. Increased PCB concentrations with distance and a congener composition of predominantly low-weight congeners in the PEs at 79m downstream of the plant site suggested an ongoing PCB source from the plant site. Chiral signatures suggested aerobic biotransformation of dissolved PCBs but did not shed any light on possible ongoing PCB inputs. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2013;32:535540.

The test properties evaluated in this study included weight loss (%), indirect tensile strength (ITS), tensile strength ratio (TSR), wet flow, wet toughness, percent toughness loss, rut depth of dry and wet conditioned specimens, rut index, and beam fatigue life. The experimental design in this study included the use of foaming technology and three hydrated lime contents (0, 1, and 2% by weight of aggregate), three aggregate sources (designated as A, B, and C), three fractioned RAP sources from the same aggregate sources, and one PG 64-22 binder. A total of 27 mixtures was designed, and a total of 120 ITS samples, 162 asphalt pavement analyzer (APA) samples, and 36 fatigue beams were tested in this study. Results indicated that the addition of recycled materials such as RAP or roofing shingles can be effectively employed in HWMA mixtures, which did not reduce wet ITS and TSR values, although the compaction temperature was only 85 C. The influence of the moist aggregate used in HWMA on rut depth can be neglected and even results in a better rut resistance when incorporating recycled materials. Stiffness values of mixtures with recycled materials were generally dependent on the aggregate type. Based on the statistical analysis for the selected aggregates, no significant difference in fatigue life was observed for mixtures with recycled materials and control mixtures.

Laboratory Evaluation of Warm-Mix Open Graded Friction Course Mixtures								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING				25	3			403	410		10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0000611			MAR 2013	2013	The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using warm mix asphalt (WMA) technologies to produce quality open graded friction course (OGFC) mixtures. This evaluation was based on the comparison of Evotherm WMA and foamed WMA mixes with traditional hot mix asphalt (HMA) OGFC using three primary criteria: draindown, permeability, and abrasion resistance. The results of the study indicated that fibers could be removed from OGFC mixtures when using the WMA technologies included in this study. This conclusion was based on the performance evaluation of the mixtures, which showed that when the fibers were removed, the permeability of the mix almost doubled. Additionally, the WMA mixtures without fibers met typical aged abrasion loss requirements and the foamed WMA mixtures without fibers performed similarly with regard to aged abrasion resistance to the HMA mixture with fibers, whereas the HMA mix without fibers showed lower resistance to abrasion than the WMA mixtures. The enhanced performance of the mixtures can be attributed to the increased binder film thickness of the WMA mixtures compared to the HMA mixtures without fibers.

We present a detailed analysis of the formation of Ge23Sb7S70 films from solution: solvent removal was studied using in situ FTIR and UV-visible absorption spectroscopies during heat treatments at various temperatures, and the glass structure and glass-solvent interactions were studied through analysis of the far- and mid-IR regions, respectively. Correlations have been established between atomic-level structural aspects and macroscopic physical properties such as refractive index, band gap energies, and surface roughness.

Despite its paleontological significance and economical value as a rare relict species, genomic resources of Metasequoia are very limited. In order to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms behind the formation of reproductive buds and the transition from vegetative phase to reproductive phase in Metasequoia, we performed sequencing of expressed sequence tags from Metasequoia vegetative buds and female buds. By using the 454 pyrosequencing technology, a total of 1,571,764 high-quality reads were generated, among which 733,128 were from vegetative buds and 775,636 were from female buds. These EST reads were clustered and assembled into 114,124 putative unique transcripts (PUTs) with an average length of 536 bp. The 97,565 PUTs that were at least 100 bp in length were functionally annotated by a similarity search against public databases and assigned with Gene Ontology (GO) terms. A total of 59 known floral gene families and 190 isotigs involved in hormone regulation were captured in the dataset. Furthermore, a set of PUTs differentially expressed in vegetative and reproductive buds, as well as SSR motifs and high confidence SNPs, were identified. This is the first large-scale expressed sequence tags ever generated in Metasequoia and the first evidence for floral genes in this critically endangered deciduous conifer species.									6	2	0	6	0	8			0032-0935	1432-2048		WOS:000315382900009	23117391

DOM from two surface waters with a low (2.9 L/mg-m) and high (5.1 L/mg-m) specific UV absorbance (SUVA(254)) values was isolated and fractionated into three fractions based on the hydrophobicity [i.e., hydrophobic (HPO), transphilic (TPH) and hydrophilic (HPI)]. DOM mass balances and DBP reactivity checks were performed to characterize the effects of isolation and fractionation steps. The fractions were chloraminated at three pHs and three bromide concentrations. The results showed that pH was the most important factor controlling HAA formation and speciation. The HAA yields significantly decreased with increase in pH from 6.3 to 9.0. The impact of bromide in the formation of brominated HAA species also became less important with increasing pH, and no brominated specie was detectable at pH 9. HPO fractions of the two source waters consistently showed higher HAA yields than TPH and HPI fractions. On the other hand, HPI fractions showed higher bromine incorporation than HPO and TPH fractions. To maintain higher and relatively stable combined chlorine residuals while reducing HAA formation, water utilities may consider keeping pH above 7.5 as one strategy. This will also lower the formation of brominated HAA species which have been shown to be more cyto- and geno-toxic than their chlorinated analogs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Samples were collected from several drinking water source waters and wastewater treatment plant effluents. The effluent impacted source waters were simulated in the laboratory by mixing treated wastewater effluents with the same source water. Formation potential (FP) tests were conducted for regulated trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetic acids (HAAs), and selected N-DBPs (nitrosamines and halonitromethanes (HNMs)) before and after the MIEX (R) treatment. The MIEX (R) process substantially lowered UV absorbance, total organic carbon, and THM and HAA FPs in all examined water samples, ranging from 39 to 87% reduction. A relatively small portion (9-33%) of HNM precursors was removed by the MIEX (R) treatment. On the other hand, an increase in N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) FP was observed after the MIEX (R) process but only for the effluent impacted waters. Soluble metals, inorganic nitrogen, and bromide in effluent impacted waters did not correlate with the increase in NDMA FP. There was no effect of MIEX (R) treatment on the removal of other nitrosamine species precursors. Simulations of typical water treatment and distribution systems scenarios showed that NDMA concentrations remained below 10 ng/L, when chlorine alone or 40 min chlorine contact time prior to ammonia addition were employed for post-disinfection. However, when chlorine and ammonia were added simultaneously, NDMA concentration reached 36 ng/L for the water tested in the study. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

More recently, social scientists have been exploring ways to integrate spatial concepts with social science data related to natural resources for theoretical, practical, and methodological reasons. This trend is particularly evident with research in park and protected area (PPA) management and outdoor recreation. The purpose of this paper is to present an updated review of how space has been incorporated into PPA research, integrate concepts and methods, identify gaps, and propose future directions for research. Overall, this review suggests that the incorporation of spatially-related social science data is advancing the field PPA research in an effective and viable way. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The new design methodology seeks to achieve a certain level of design robustness, in addition to meeting safety and cost requirements. Here, a design is considered robust if the variation in the system response is insensitive to the variation of noise factors such as uncertain soil parameters and construction quality. When multiple objectives are considered, a single best design may not exist, and a trade-off may be necessary. In such a case, a genetic algorithm is adopted for multi-objective optimization and a Pareto Front, which describes a trade-off relationship between cost and robustness at a given safety level, is established. The new design methodology is illustrated with an example of spread foundation design. The significance of the RGD methodology is demonstrated. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Grujicic, M.; Pandurangan, B.; Snipes, J. S.; Yen, C. -F.; Cheeseman, B. A.								Multi-Length Scale-Enriched Continuum-Level Material Model for Kevlar(A (R))-Fiber-Reinforced Polymer-Matrix Composites								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				22	3			681	695		10.1007/s11665-012-0329-6			MAR 2013	2013	Fiber-reinforced polymer matrix composite materials display quite complex deformation and failure behavior under ballistic/blast impact loading conditions. This complexity is generally attributed to a number of factors such as (a) hierarchical/multi-length scale architecture of the material microstructure; (b) nonlinear, rate-dependent and often pressure-sensitive mechanical response; and (c) the interplay of various intrinsic phenomena and processes such as fiber twisting, interfiber friction/sliding, etc. Material models currently employed in the computational engineering analyses of ballistic/blast impact protective structures made of this type of material do not generally include many of the aforementioned aspects of the material dynamic behavior. Consequently, discrepancies are often observed between computational predictions and their experimental counterparts. To address this problem, the results of an extensive set of molecular-level computational analyses regarding the role of various microstructural/morphological defects on the Kevlar(A (R)) fiber mechanical properties are used to upgrade one of the existing continuum-level material models for fiber-reinforced composites. The results obtained show that the response of the material is significantly affected as a result of the incorporation of microstructural effects both under quasi-static simple mechanical testing condition and under dynamic ballistic-impact conditions.									11	0	0	0	0	11			1059-9495			WOS:000314899800005

Algebraic methods applied to shortest path and maximum flow problems in stochastic networks								NETWORKS				61	2	SI		117	127		10.1002/net.21485			MAR 2013	2013	We present an algebraic approach for computing the distribution of the length of a shortest s - t path, as well as the distribution of the capacity of a minimum s - t cut, in a network where the arc values (lengths and capacities) have known (discrete) probability distributions. For each problem, both exact and approximating algorithms are presented. These approximating algorithms are shown to yield upper and lower bounds on the distribution of interest. This approach likewise provides exact and bounding distributions on the maximum flow value in stochastic networks. We also obtain bounds on the expected shortest path length as well as the expected minimum cut capacity (and the expected maximum flow value). (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J	Taydas, Zeynep; Ozdamar, Ozgur								A Divided Government, an Ideological Parliament, and an Insecure Leader: Turkey's Indecision about Joining the Iraq War								SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY				94	1			217	241		10.1111/j.1540-6237.2012.00871.x			MAR 2013	2013	Objectives On March 1, 2003, the Turkish parliament rejected a government motion that would involve Turkey in the Iraq war and allow U.S. forces to use Turkish territory in an offensive against Iraq. This decision has been considered as a significant departure from traditional Western-oriented Turkish foreign policy. We investigate the reasons behind this rather unexpected foreign policy decision. Method To systematically examine the decision-making process and the outcome, we utilize the decision-units framework. We present primary and secondary evidence from government and media sources and utilize interviews conducted with some of the high-level decisionmakers that were involved in decision making at the time. This article combines traditional methodological tools, such as elite interviews and process tracing, with novel approaches in foreign policy analysis studies. Results The nature of the decision-unit, decision-making rules, the extraordinary circumstances surrounding the AKP (Adalet and Kalkinma PartisiJustice and Development Party) leadership, and the absence of a strong and decisive leader shaped the outcome. Conclusion The Turkish parliament's decision on its role in the Iraq war is an interesting and informative case for foreign policy studies. It challenges the conventional wisdom on parliamentary influence in foreign policy making in parliamentary regimes. Under certain circumstanceseven when a single-party enjoys parliamentary majorityparliaments can be major players in foreign policy decision making.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0038-4941			WOS:000314725200011		
J	Yan, Jingyuan; Huang, Yong; Chrisey, Douglas B.								Laser-assisted printing of alginate long tubes and annular constructs								BIOFABRICATION				5	1					015002	10.1088/1758-5082/5/1/015002			MAR 2013	2013	Laser-assisted printing such as laser-induced forward transfer has been well studied to pattern or fabricate two-dimensional constructs. In particular, laser printing has found increasing biomedical applications as an orifice-free cell and organ printing approach, especially for highly viscous biomaterials and biological materials. Unfortunately, there have been very few studies on the efficacy of three-dimensional printing performance of laser printing. This study has investigated the feasibility of laser tube printing and the effects of sodium alginate concentration and operating conditions such as the laser fluence and laser spot size on the printing quality during laser-assisted printing of alginate annular constructs (short tubes) with a nominal diameter of 3 mm. It is found that highly viscous materials such as alginate can be printed into well-defined long tubes and annular constructs. The tube wall thickness and tube outer diameter decrease with the sodium alginate concentration, while they first increase, then decrease and finally increase again with the laser fluence. The sodium alginate concentration dominates if the laser fluence is low, and the laser fluence dominates if the sodium alginate concentration is low.									20	1	0	9	0	21			1758-5082			WOS:000314813200002	23172571	
J	McNulty, Terry; Zattoni, Alessandro; Douglas, Thomas								Developing Corporate Governance Research through Qualitative Methods: A Review of Previous Studies								CORPORATE GOVERNANCE-AN INTERNATIONAL REVIEW				21	2	SI		183	198		10.1111/corg.12006			MAR 2013	2013	Manuscript Type Review Research Question/Issue The article is concerned with the prevalence, character, and development of qualitative research within the field of corporate governance. The paper provides an overview of published qualitative research in the field of corporate governance based on a structured literature search of papers published in scholarly peer-reviewed journals between 1986 and 2011. Research Findings/Insights A fine-grained search based on key words resulted in a sample of 78 qualitative corporate governance studies. A review and content analysis of these studies show that qualitative studies in governance have grown in number since the 1990s, but remain a small fraction of the published work on corporate governance. Studies are mostly developed by UK and European scholars, published in European journals and tend to explore boards of directors more than other governance related actors and mechanisms. These studies utilize a range of disciplines, predominantly management, adopting a wide range of methods, the most prevalent being that of the interview, often in combination with other methods to get a better account of the empirical phenomenon. Theoretical/Academic Implications The search reveals an eclectic range of theories, spanning several disciplines, which is serving to generate, elaborate, and refine theorizing about corporate governance and the associated meanings, mechanisms, processes and relationships. There is much scope and need for more qualitative studies of significant rigor and relevance which explore the array of interactions and processes involved in corporate governance, across different levels of analysis and contexts. Practitioner/Policy Implications After over two decades of research and reform of corporate governance, problems of practice remain, and corporate governance prescription via codes and other forms of regulation is increasing in search of better governance. Qualitative research can assist policy-makers and practitioners to develop more efficient governance mechanisms, by shedding light on the efficacy of policy prescription. Qualitative research provides a basis for rethinking and challenging some of the dominant assumptions and meanings about how governance actors and institutions actually function.									17	0	0	0	0	17			0964-8410			WOS:000314659900007		
J	Li, Zhe; Cho, Byung Rae; Melloy, Brian J.								Quality by Design Studies on Multi-response Pharmaceutical Formulation Modeling and Optimization								JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL INNOVATION				8	1			28	44		10.1007/s12247-012-9145-7			MAR 2013	2013	Formulation optimization, one of the most crucial components in quality by design, is performed to determine optimal settings of ingredients so that the desirable performance of critical pharmaceutical quality characteristics is achieved early in the design phase. Formulation optimization can be implemented by the use of a combination of scientific approaches; in particular, response surface methodology combined with design of experiments is typically utilized to fit linear or quadratic functions when estimating response surfaces. This approach may not always be suitable, though, since estimation accuracy heavily impacts the quality of the solutions. In addition, when a formulation with multiple quality characteristics is being considered, the desirability function (DF) approach is frequently incorporated into the optimization procedure. In this case, a weight-based overall DF is usually treated as an objective function to be maximized. However, this approach has several potential shortcomings. Therefore, in order to overcome the limitations of this traditional formulation optimization procedure, we propose a priority-based goal programming scheme that utilizes higher-order polynomial response surface functions and incorporates modified DF approaches to account for additional characteristics, such as the response variance and covariance. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1872-5120			WOS:000314775600003		
J	Lam, Son K.; Ahearne, Michael; Mullins, Ryan; Hayati, Babak; Schillewaert, Niels					Mullins, Ryan/0000-0002-7991-7975			Exploring the dynamics of antecedents to consumer-brand identification with a new brand								JOURNAL OF THE ACADEMY OF MARKETING SCIENCE				41	2			234	252		10.1007/s11747-012-0301-x			MAR 2013	2013	This study examines the dynamics of consumer-brand identification (CBI) and its antecedents in the context of the launch of a new brand. Three focal drivers of CBI with a new brand are examined, namely: perceived quality (the instrumental driver), self-brand congruity (the symbolic driver), and consumer innate innovativeness (a trait-based driver). Using longitudinal survey data, the authors find that on average, CBI growth trajectories initially rise after the introduction but eventually decline, following an inverted-U shape. More importantly, the longitudinal effects of the antecedents suggest that CBI can take different paths. Consumer innovativeness creates a fleeting identification with the brand that dissipates over time. On the other hand, company-controlled drivers of CBI-such as brand positioning-can contribute to the build-up of deep-structure CBI that grows stronger over time. Based on these findings, the authors offer normative guidelines to managers on consumer-brand relationship investment.									27	0	0	0	0	27			0092-0703			WOS:000314887300006		
J	Pavan, Enrique; Duckett, Susan K.								Fatty acid composition and interrelationships among eight retail cuts of grass-feed beef								MEAT SCIENCE				93	3			371	377		10.1016/j.meatsci.2012.09.021			MAR 2013	2013	The aim of this research was to evaluate: 1) fatty acid (FA) profile of eight retail cuts (eye of round, ribeye, top round, striploin, tenderloin, top-sirloin, underblade, ground beef) from grass-fed steers, 2) the association between striploin (longissimus muscle) FA profile and that from the other retail cuts, and 3) the changes in FA profile associated with retail cut total FA content. All of the retail cuts, except underblade and ground beef, would be considered lean (<10 g) based on total FA content. Total saturated fatty acids were positively correlated to total FA content; whereas, negative correlations were observed with total FA content and total monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. No correlation was observed between total FA and CLA cis-9, trans-11. Striploin trans-11 C18:1 and CLA cis-9, trans-11 proportions, and n-6:n-3 ratio were positive and highly correlated with those in the other retail cuts. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Reviewing, Categorizing, and Analyzing the Literature on BlackWhite Mean Differences for Predictors of Job Performance: Verifying Some perceptions and Updating/Correcting Others								PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY				66	1			91	126		10.1111/peps.12007			SPR 2013	2013	In both theoretical and applied literatures, there is confusion regarding accurate values for expected BlackWhite subgroup differences in personnel selection test scores. Much confusion arises because empirical estimates of standardized subgroup differences (d) are subject to many of the same biasing factors associated with validity coefficients (i.e., d is functionally related to a point-biserial r). To address such issues, we review/cumulate, categorize, and analyze a systematic set of many predictor-specific meta-analyses in the literature. We focus on confounds due to general use of concurrent, versus applicant, samples in the literature on BlackWhite d. We also focus on potential confusion due to different constructs being assessed within the same selection test method, as well as the influence of those constructs on d. It is shown that many types of predictors (such as biodata inventories or assessment centers) can have magnitudes of d that are much larger than previously thought. Indeed, some predictors (such as work samples) can have ds similar to that associated with paper-and-pencil tests of cognitive ability. We present more realistic values of d for both researcher and practitioner use. Implications for practice and future research are noted.									10	0	0	1	1	11			0031-5826			WOS:000314995000003		
J	Ferrer, Myra Clarisse; Hammig, Michael								Economic impacts of IPM sampling methods for collards								RENEWABLE AGRICULTURE AND FOOD SYSTEMS				28	1			43	49		10.1017/S1742170511000615			MAR 2013	2013	Integrated pest management (IPM) has been very successful in directing farming to a more environment-friendly production. It is a great tool for producers in transition to organic farming. However, the extent of its economic impact is not well understood by farmers. This study looks at the amount of savings and potential market profitability of using IPM in South Carolina collard production considering alternative scouting methods. Scouting is an essential part of IPM that is usually ignored. This analysis presents a comparative assessment of the merits of conventional sampling (CS) and binomial sequential scouting method (SSM). SSM is a recently developed scouting system for traditionally operated collard farms that is geared toward a more economical execution of scouting without forfeiting the effectiveness of the process. Financial analytical tools, specifically costs and returns methods and sensitivity analysis on prices, were utilized to determine the economic advantages or disadvantages of the two methods. Outcomes indicate that both scouting methods would result in cost savings if used on traditionally operated farms. Particularly, the cost savings per hectare generated from IPM with SSM [3.62% of total cost (TC) and 3.91% of total variable cost (TVC)] is higher than the cost savings from IPM with CS (2.91% of TC and 3.15% of TVC). The difference in cost savings between IPM with CS and IPM with SSM basically came from the less scouting time of SSM that entailed lower labor cost for the farm. Therefore, to attain maximum profitability potential, using IPM with the SSM is a better option. Some may conjecture that the cost savings were insignificant due to the low percentages in cost savings. However, its importance is evident at the potential savings per farm and at the aggregate/state level.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1742-1705			WOS:000314928700004

We first simulate a baseline scenario (S-1) that assumes no health behavior change, and compare this with three simulated intervention scenarios: expansion of Quitline reach to enhance smoking cessation (S-2), an increased penetration of diabetes screening (S-3) and construction of additional recreational facilities (S-4). We compared the disease-free life years (DFLY) gained from each intervention scenario by 2050 on a year-by-year and cumulative basis. Simulation results show that increasing access to recreational facilities achieves the greatest gain in DFLYs for every year from 2011 to 2050. By 2050, the cumulative DFLY gain is 22 393, 5956 and 41 396 for S-2, S-3, and S-4, respectively. The cost-effectiveness ratios for Quitline expansion, diabetes screening, and recreational facility construction are $1802, $1285, and $1322, per DFLY gained, respectively.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1078-4659			WOS:000314342300009	23358291

This demonstrates a method for coating nitinol alloys with nanometer thick layers of graphene for applications as a stent material. Graphene was grown on copper substrates via chemical vapor deposition and then transferred onto nitinol substrates. In order to understand how the graphene coating could change biological response, cell viability of rat aortic endothelial cells and rat aortic smooth muscle cells was investigated. Moreover, the effect of graphene-coatings on cell adhesion and morphology was examined with fluorescent confocal microscopy. Cells were stained for actin and nuclei, and there were noticeable differences between pristine nitinol samples compared to graphene-coated samples. Total actin expression from rat aortic smooth muscle cells was found using western blot. Protein adsorption characteristics, an indicator for potential thrombogenicity, were determined for serum albumin and fibrinogen with gel electrophoresis. Moreover, the transfer of charge from fibrinogen to substrate was deduced using Raman spectroscopy. It was found that graphene coating on nitinol substrates met the functional requirements for a stent material and improved the biological response compared to uncoated nitinol. Thus, graphene-coated nitinol is a viable candidate for a stent material.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1940-087X			WOS:000209226900040	23486380	
J	Zinzow, Heidi M; Brooks, Johnell; Stern, Erica B								Driving-related anxiety in recently deployed service members: cues, mental health correlates, and help-seeking behavior.								Military medicine				178	3			e357	61		10.7205/MILMED-D-12-00303			2013-Mar	2013	Recent military operations have involved repeated trauma exposure while driving vehicles. Combat deployment and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been associated with risky driving practices, increasing the likelihood of fatalities and problems adjusting to civilian life. However, no studies have specifically examined the role of driving-related anxiety, including common cues and mental health correlates. This study conducted structured interviews with 46 recently deployed service members. Interviews assessed the prevalence of driving-related anxiety or hyperarousal (anger or irritation) in relation to civilian driving scenarios, combat exposure, post-traumatic stress symptoms, depression symptoms, and help-seeking behavior. The majority of participants reported high driving anxiety or hyperarousal in response to scenarios involving close proximity to other cars. Driving-related anxiety was positively correlated with PTSD and depression. Although PTSD and driving anxiety were positively associated with help seeking, only one-third of soldiers sought help for driving anxiety and most sought help from informal sources (i.e., friend and battle buddy). The findings underscore the need to address driving-related anxiety in combat-exposed service members with mental health symptoms, with a particular focus on specific anxiety-provoking situations. Furthermore, interventions that reduce stigma and improve access to formal care could improve help seeking and treatment for these problems.									2	0	0	0	0	2				1930-613X		MEDLINE:23707125	23707125

The problem of modeling macromolecular electrostatics is reviewed from two different angles: as a mathematical task provided the specific definition of the system to be modeled and as a physical problem aiming to better capture the phenomena occurring in the real experiments. In addition, specific attention is paid to methods to extend the capabilities of the existing solvers to model large systems toward applications of calculations of the electrostatic potential and energies in molecular motors, mitochondria complex, photosynthetic machinery and systems involving large nano-objects.									0	0	0	0	0	0						MEDLINE:24199185	24199185

Hsein; Atamturktur, Sez				Wang, Lei/M-6627-2015				Reliability-based design of rock slopes - A new perspective on design robustness								ENGINEERING GEOLOGY				154				56	63		10.1016/j.enggeo.2012.12.004			FEB 28 2013	2013	Traditional reliability-based rock slope designs, in which the lowest-cost design is selected from all designs meeting target reliability requirements, are often sensitive to variations in noise factors such as rock shear properties. Consequently, a design that was initially judged acceptable may not satisfy reliability requirements if the variation of rock properties has been greatly underestimated. The authors present a Robust Geotechnical Design (RGD) approach for purposes of addressing this dilemma, by considering the robustness explicitly in the design process. In the context of rock slope design, this proposed RGD approach aims to make the response (i.e., failure probability) of a rock slope system insensitive to, or robust against, the variation of rock shear properties by adjusting design parameters (i.e., such as slope angle and height). Compared to traditional reliability-based design, the RGD approach adds design robustness as one of its design objectives. Thus, multi-objective optimization, considering both cost and robustness, is needed to select optimal designs in the acceptable design space where safety is guaranteed by a constraint on the reliability. In this paper, the concept of the Pareto Front, a collection of optimal designs that reflect the trade-off between cost and robustness, is implemented in the RGD approach. The proposed RGD approach is demonstrated with an example of a rock slope design. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									22	0	0	3	0	22			0013-7952			WOS:000315610000006		
J	Ge, Ting; Pierce, Flint; Perahia, Dvora; Grest, Gary S.; Robbins, Mark O.								Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Polymer Welding: Strength from Interfacial Entanglements								PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS				110	9					098301	10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.098301			FEB 28 2013	2013	Large-scale simulations of thermal welding of polymers are performed to investigate the rise of mechanical strength at the polymer-polymer interface with the welding time t(w). The welding process is at the core of integrating polymeric elements into devices as well as in the thermal induced healing of polymers, processes that require the development of interfacial strength equal to that of the bulk. Our simulations show that the interfacial strength saturates at the bulk shear strength long before polymers diffuse by their radius of gyration. Along with the strength increase, the dominant failure mode changes from chain pullout at the interface to chain scission as in the bulk. The formation of sufficient entanglements across the interface, which we track using a primitive path analysis, is required to arrest catastrophic chain pullout at the interface. The bulk response is not fully recovered until the density of entanglements at the interface reaches the bulk value. Moreover, the increase of interfacial strength before saturation is proportional to the number of interfacial entanglements between chains from opposite sides.

Adding 250 mu M AH(2)QDS increased the total substrate utilization by 23-66%, and specifically xylose utilization by 20-54% at glucose:xylose ratios of 1:1, 1:3 and 1:9. Adding 250 mu M AH(2)QDS also increased the substrate utilization by 40-88% at all tested glucose:xylose ratios (which ranged from 1:9 to 9:1). Increasing AH(2)QDS concentrations from 250 mu M to 2 mM increased xylose utilization (>99% xylose consumed) as well as cumulative hydrogen production during mixed sugar fermentation. The extent of glucose utilization was consistent amongst all tests, which was expected. However, hydroquinone amendment specifically increased the extent of xylose utilized irrespective of the starting glucose:xylose ratio. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of 100% xylose utilization by C. beijerinckii NCIMB 8052 grown under mixed sugar conditions. These data demonstrate that the substrate utilization, particularly xylose utilization, can be manipulated by amending extracellular redox active compounds. This will improve pentose utilization during fermentation of hydrolyzates that result from pre-treatment of lignocellulosic materials with wild type (non-GMO) cultures.

For this study, variations in dissolved organic matter (DOM) spectroscopic properties and DBP formation potentials (DBPFPs), and the correlations among these various parameters, were investigated in river water samples collected under two contrasting storm event conditions (a strong summer storm versus a weak fall event). Fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) combined with parallel factor analysis revealed that a combination of two humic-like components (C1 and C2) dominated the EEM data of the storm samples. Measured DOM characteristics and DBPFPs varied over a wider range during the more intense summer storm, exhibiting higher values of specific ultraviolet absorbance and C1/C2 ratio at high flow conditions. Variations in the fluorescence index were less pronounced during the two storm events. The spectroscopic changes were well explained by the input of terrestrial DOM sources from the surrounding catchments during the storms. Different trends of the formation potentials for trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids on the recession limb of the hydrographs suggest that the structures responsible for DBP precursors during storm events may not be the same for the two classes of DBPs. The ultraviolet light-absorbing moieties in DOM appear to play major roles in generating DBPs, as evidenced by their strong positive correlations with DBPFPs. Higher correlations with DBPFP for C1 versus C2 suggest that humic-like substances associated with more aromatic and condensed structures have a greater proclivity to generate DBP upon chlorination.

For the single-dot probes, the crosslinking further stabilizes the dot structure, while for those packed with multiple dots, the individual probe imaging results demonstrate that the fluorescence properties are additive, with more dots for higher emission intensities in a proportional fashion, thus enabling the preparation of ultra-bright fluorescence probes.									33	3	0	9	0	33			1613-6810			WOS:000315103300008	23413239

Using a Plackett-Burman experimental design to investigate the process of tip ultrasonication (23 kHz), conjugate formation was investigated as a function of ultrasonication times (0, 5, 60 min) and functionalized SWNTs of various tube lengths (SWNT-X-L), (X = -OH or -COOH and L = 3.0 mu m, 7.5 mu m).Results: Enzyme activity (K-M, k(cat), k(cat)/K-M, v(max) and n (the Hill parameter)) of pGOx (pristine), sGOx (sonicated) and GOx-SWNT-X-L revealed that sonication of any duration increased both K-M and k(cat) of GOx but did not change k(cat)/K-M. Functionalized tubes had the most dramatic effect, reducing both K-M and k(cat) and reducing k(cat)/K-M. UV-vis spectra over the range of 300 to 550 nm of native enzyme-bound FAD (lambda(max) at 381 and 452 nm) or the blue-shifted solvated FAD of the denatured enzyme (lambda(max) at 377 and 448 nm) revealed that ultrasonication up to 60 minutes had no influence on spectral characteristics of FAD but that the longer SWNTs caused some partial denaturation leading to egress of FAD. Circular dichroism spectral analysis of the 2 degrees structure showed that sonication of any duration caused enrichment in the a-helical content at the sacrifice of the unordered sequences in GOx while the presence of SWNTs, regardless of length and/or functionality, reduced the beta-sheet content of pristine GOx. Surface profiling by white light interferometry revealed that ultrasonication produced some aggregation of GOx and that GOx effectively debundled the SWNT.Conclusions: Supramolecular conjugates formed from shorter, -OH functionalized SWNTs using longer sonication times (60 min) gave the most favored combination for forming bioactive conjugates.									5	0	0	2	0	5			1477-3155			WOS:000315946300001	23425592

Physisorption of functionalized gold nanoparticles on AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors for sensing applications								APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS				102	7					074102	10.1063/1.4791788			FEB 18 2013	2013	AlGaN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) were used to measure electrical characteristics of physisorbed gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) functionalized with alkanethiols with a terminal methyl, amine, or carboxyl functional group. Additional alkanethiol was physisorbed onto the NP treated devices to distinguish between the effects of the Au NPs and alkanethiols on HEMT operation. Scanning Kelvin probe microscopy and electrical measurements were used to characterize the treatment effects. The HEMTs were operated near threshold voltage due to the greatest sensitivity in this region. The Au NP/HEMT system electrically detected functional group differences on adsorbed NPs which is pertinent to biosensor applications. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

It relies on a combination of two template-assisted nanofabrication/patterning methods: electrochemical growth of metal nanowires in nanoporous sacrificial templates and partial masking of a surface with a self-assembled colloidal monolayer. A great potential of this novel approach, termed here colloidal occlusion template method, is demonstrated on the example of the fabrication of omniphobic surfaces comprised of nickel micronails whose density is varied to approach highest possible contact angles. After chemical modification to reduce their surface tension, these microstructures with reentrant geometry support the non-wetting Cassie state for both high-surface-tension water and low-surface-tension hexadecane. In particular, superhydrophobic behavior (contact angles exceeding 150 degrees) is found for water, while oleophobicity (contact angles approaching 110 degrees) is observed for hexadecane. The proposed approach can be exploited for the fabrication of a large variety of supported high-aspect-ratio nano/microstructures in applications where a surface density of features has to be several orders of magnitude lower than can be obtained with conventional template methods.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1616-301X			WOS:000314925400013

Pathological remodeling of valve ECM is observed in both pediatric and adult cardiac disorders. It is well established that intracardiac hemodynamics play a significant role in the morphogenesis of cardiovascular tissues. However, the mechanisms that transduce mechanical forces into morphogenetic processes are not well understood. Here, we report the development of a threedimensional, in vitro culture system that allows for culture of embryonic valve tissue under specific pulsatile flow conditions. This system was used to investigate the role that fluid flow plays in fibrous ECM expression during valve formation and to test the underlying cellular mechanisms that regulate this mechanotransduction. When cultured under pulsatile flow, developing valve tissues upregulated fibrous ECM expression at both the transcript and protein levels in comparison to no-flow controls. Flow-cultured valve tissues also underwent morphological development, as cushions elongated into leaflet-like structures that were absent in no-flow controls. Furthermore, rhoA, a member of the cytoskeletal actin-regulating GTPase family of proteins, was upregulated and activated by flow culture. Inhibition of the downstream rhoA effector kinase, ROCK, blocked flow-driven fibrous ECM accumulation and tissue stiffening, while the addition of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a rhoA activator, stimulated fibrous ECM deposition and tissue stiffening. These results support a prominent role for the rhoA pathway in the mechanotransduction of hemodynamic forces during fibrous remodeling of developing valve tissue. Our results also point to a potential link between regulation of the actinomyosin cytoskeleton and fibrous ECM synthesis in cardiovascular tissues. 2012 Elsevier Inc.

However, in this setup the chemical potential of the nanowire is generally pinned by the Fermi surface of the superconductor. This makes the tuning of the chemical potential by external electrical gates, a crucial requirement for unambiguous detection of Majorana fermions, very challenging in experiments. Here we show that a tunable topological superconducting regime supporting Majorana fermions can be realized in semiconductor nanowires using uniaxial stress. For n-type nanowires the uniaxial stress tunes the effective chemical potential, while for p-type systems the effective pairing may also be modified by stress, thus significantly enhancing the topological minigap. We show that the required stress, of the order of 0.1%, is within current experimental reach using conventional piezocrystals.

J	Boylan, Gregory L.; Goethals, Paul L.; Cho, Byung Rae								Robust parameter design in resource-constrained environments: An investigation of trade-offs between costs and precision within variable processes								APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING				37	4			2394	2416		10.1016/j.apm.2012.05.017			FEB 15 2013	2013	Engineers and scientists often identify robust parameter design as one of the most important process and quality improvement methods. Focused on statistical modeling and numerical optimization strategies, most researchers typically assume a process with reasonably small variability. Realistically, however, industrial processes often exhibit larger variability, particularly in mass production lines. In such cases, many of the modeling assumptions behind the robust parameter design models available in the literature do not hold. Accordingly, the results and recommendations provided to decision makers could generate suboptimal modifications to processes and products. As manufacturers seek improved methods for ensuring quality in resource-constrained environments, experimenters should examine trade-offs to achieve the levels of precision that best support their decision making. In contrast to previous research, this paper proposes a trade-off analysis between the cost of replication and the desired precision of generated solutions. We consider several techniques in the early stages of experimental design, using Monte Carlo simulation as a tool, for revealing potential options to the decision maker. This is perhaps the first study to show the avenue which may lead to more effective robust parameter design models with the optimal combination of cost constraints and desired precision of solutions.

The national parks and wildlife sanctuaries in the Phetchabun Mountains are recognized as areas with a high density of endemic species deserving protection. Four new species of Cheumatopsyche (C. recta, C. diversa, C. triangula, and C. tongto) have been found in Phu Khieo Wildlife Sanctuary, Phu Kradueng National Park and Thung Salaeng Luang National Park; a fifth new species (C. cava) has been found in Phu Kradueng National Park. Describing hydropsychid species is important not only to study diversity and distribution but also to facilitate eventual descriptions of larvae for use in freshwater biomonitoring programs to detect pollution.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1175-5326			WOS:000314929900002	24698929

It has been thought that functional myocardial repair and regeneration could be regulated by stem cell-cardiomyocyte contact. However, because various contact modes (junction formation, cell fusion, partial cell fusion, and tunneling nanotube formation) occur randomly in a conventional coculture system, the particular regulation corresponding to a specific contact mode could not be analyzed. In this study, we used laser-patterned biochips to define cell-cell contact modes for systematic study of contact-mediated cellular interactions at the single-cell level. The results showed that the biochip design allows defined stem cell-cardiomyocyte contact-mode formation, which can be used to determine specific cellular interactions, including electrical coupling, mechanical coupling, and mitochondria transfer. The biochips will help us gain knowledge of contact-mediated interactions between stem cells and cardiomyocytes, which are fundamental for formulating a strategy to achieve stem cell-based cardiac tissue regeneration.									12	1	0	11	0	13			1932-6203			WOS:000315970300176	23418583
