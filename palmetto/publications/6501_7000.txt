J	Dong, Liang								Stimulated thermal Rayleigh scattering in optical fibers								OPTICS EXPRESS				21	3			2642	2656		10.1364/OE.21.002642			FEB 11 2013	2013	Recently, mode instability was observed in optical fiber lasers at high powers, severely limiting power scaling for single-mode outputs. Some progress has been made towards understanding the underlying physics. A thorough understanding of the effect is critical for continued progress of this very important technology area. Mode instability in optical fibers is, in fact, a manifestation of stimulated thermal Rayleigh scattering. In this work, a quasi-closed-form solution for the nonlinear coupling coefficient is found for stimulated thermal Rayleigh scattering in optical fibers. The results help to significantly improve understanding of mode instability. (C) 2013 Optical Society of America									58	6	0	0	0	63			1094-4087			WOS:000315991400010	23481720

Here, the development of biohybrid microfibers comprised of encapsulated bacteria in hydrogel matrices produced on-chip using microfluidics is reported. The fiber production process utilizes hydrodynamic shaping of a cell-laden core fluid by a miscible sheath fluid. Production of the fibers containing viable bacteria was continuous in contrast to the more typical methods in which cells infiltrated or were attached to prepared fibers. The biohybrid fibers were composed of poly (ethylene glycol dimethacrylate) matrices and individually both E. coli and B. cereus were explored as model cellular payloads. Post processing growth curves (24 h) of bacteria within fibers were in excellent agreement with that of controls suggesting minimal impact. Finally, the biohybrid fibers showed even distribution of encapsulated cells and >90% cell viability.									27	0	0	11	0	27			1616-301X			WOS:000314924900005

We show theoretically that end-fire coupling is a promising candidate to deliver light into regions with subwavelength dimension on flat metal surfaces. A design and optimization principle is presented for a flat metal surface and further demonstrated in a plasmonic Mach-Zehnder interferometer platform. The physical mechanism is discussed based on reciprocity. By considering the radiation pattern and position of the incidence, the coupling efficiency at the metal/air interface can be enhanced up to 77.6%-95.4%, which is promising to develop energy-efficient applications for on-chip plasmonic waveguide networks and sensors.

Gene co-expression networks built using microarray expression profiles are one technique for discovering and interpreting gene relationships. A knowledge-independent thresholding technique, such as Random Matrix Theory (RMT), is useful for identifying meaningful relationships. Highly connected genes in the thresholded network are then grouped into modules that provide insight into their collective functionality. While it has been shown that co-expression networks are biologically relevant, it has not been determined to what extent any given network is functionally robust given perturbations in the input sample set. For such a test, hundreds of networks are needed and hence a tool to rapidly construct these networks. To examine functional robustness of networks with varying input, we enhanced an existing RMT implementation for improved scalability and tested functional robustness of human (Homo sapiens), rice (Oryza sativa) and budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). We demonstrate dramatic decrease in network construction time and computational requirements and show that despite some variation in global properties between networks, functional similarity remains high. Moreover, the biological function captured by co-expression networks thresholded by RMT is highly robust.									11	0	0	6	0	11			1932-6203			WOS:000315157200080	23409071

While prokaryotic ACKs have been the subject of extensive biochemical and structural characterization, there is a comparative paucity of information on eukaryotic ACKs, and prior to this report, no structure of an ACK of eukaryotic origin was available. We determined the structures of ACKs from the eukaryotic pathogens Entamoeba histolytica and Cryptococcus neoformans. Each active site is located at an interdomain interface, and the acetate and phosphate binding pockets display sequence and structural conservation with their prokaryotic counterparts. Interestingly, the E. histolytica ACK has previously been shown to be pyrophosphate (PPi)-dependent, and is the first ACK demonstrated to have this property. Examination of its structure demonstrates how subtle amino acid substitutions within the active site have converted cosubstrate specificity from ATP to PPi while retaining a similar backbone conformation. Differences in the angle between domains surrounding the active site suggest that interdomain movement may accompany catalysis. Taken together, these structures are consistent with the eukaryotic ACKs following a similar reaction mechanism as is proposed for the prokaryotic homologs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

They play important roles in the ecology and economy in their existing forest ecosystems. Chestnut blight has caused catastrophic losses of C. dentata populations since 1904. It is especially important to understand the differences in chemical ecology characteristics between C. dentata and C. mollissima when scientists try to make use of blight resistance of C. dentata to help the recovery of C. mollissima populations in North America. The objective of this research is to compare the allelopathy effect of C. dentata and C. mollissima by leaf water extract bioassay method.Methods Using germination rate and vigor as seed germination parameters and radicle, plumule elongation and fresh weight change of seedling as seedling growth parameters, we studied the effect of water extract of C. mollissima leaves on dicotyledons lettuce, radish and cucumber and monocotyledons onion, rice and wheat. We compared the allelopathic intensity of water extract and 11 elution components that were separated by X-5 macroporous resins from water extract of C. dentata and C. mollissima. The strongest allelopathic fraction of C. dentata and C. mollissima was analyzed by liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometer technique and standard substance counterevidence experiment.Important findings Evidence of inhibition of seed germination and seedling growth of test plants indicated that water extract of C. mollissima leaf has allelopathic properties. Data on inhibition of seed germination and seedling growth in lettuce indicated that the allelopathy of C. mollissima leaves was stronger than C. dentata leaves. The allelochemicals of C. dentata and C. mollissima extracts are in 7:3, 6:4 and 5:5 elution fractions, as documented by the bioassay data. The strongest allelopathy fraction of C. dentata and C. mollissima extract (5:5 elution fraction) contained chlorogenic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, protocatechuic acid, gallic acid, etc. Results suggest that the difference of chemical ecology characteristics between C. dentata and C. mollissima should not be ignored by restoration ecologists.									0	5	0	0	0	5			1005-264X			BCI:BCI201400002642		
J	Willis, Ben E.; Alley, Bethany L.; Rodgers, John H., Jr.								Bioavailability and Analytical Measurement of Copper Residuals in Sediments								WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION				224	2					1423	10.1007/s11270-012-1423-y			FEB 2013	2013	Analytical measurements are commonly used to screen for toxicity or lack of toxicity from sediment-associated copper. Comparisons of analytical measurements with toxicological responses can be useful for determining the practicality of analytical measurements for assessing the toxicity of copper in sediments. The purpose of this research was to determine the utility of method detection limits (MDLs; i.e., minimum concentration of an analyte such as copper that can be measured with 99 % confidence with a specific analytical method and matrix) to predict the bioavailability of copper in five different sediments. The specific objectives of this research were to (1) select and characterize five sediments with different characteristics, (2) amend and measure a range of copper concentrations in the five sediments to determine MDLs and bioavailability of copper amendments in those sediments, (3) discern relationships with sediment characteristics to MDLs and bioavailability of copper in the five sediments, and (4) compare MDLs and observed toxicity to Hyalella azteca Saussure as an indicator of copper bioavailability in the five sediments. The lowest copper concentrations that elicited an observable adverse effect ranged from 15 to 550 mg Cu/kg, and the MDLs ranged from 1.5 to 6 mg Cu/kg. The MDLs and measured copper concentrations were not adequately predictive of the bioavailability and toxicity of copper in the five sediments. No adverse effects were observed for H. azteca exposed for 10 days to the sediment from California with simultaneously extractable metals > acid-volatile sulfides. Since the lowest observed effects concentrations of copper in the five sediments ranged two orders of magnitude, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration screening values (threshold and probable effect levels) were not predictive of H. azteca responses to the copper-amended sediments.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0049-6979	1573-2932		WOS:000315281300027		
J	Raftery, Tara D.; Lindler, Heidi; McNealy, Tamara L.								Altered Host Cell-Bacteria Interaction due to Nanoparticle Interaction with a Bacterial Biofilm								MICROBIAL ECOLOGY				65	2			496	503		10.1007/s00248-012-0128-5			FEB 2013	2013	Nanoparticle (NP) use in everyday applications creates the potential for NPs to enter the environment where, in aquatic systems, they are likely to settle on substrates and interact with microbial communities. Legionella pneumophila biofilms are found as part of microbial communities in both natural and man-made environments, especially in man-made cooling systems. The bacterium is the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease. Legionella requires a host cell for replication in the environment, and amoebae commonly serve as this host cell. Our previous work demonstrated significant changes in Legionella biofilm morphology after exposure to 0.7 mu g/L gold NPs (AuNPs). Here, we investigate how these morphology changes alter host-bacteria interactions using Acanthamoeba polyphaga as a model. Host-bacteria-NP interactions are affected by NP characteristics. Biofilms exposed to 4- and 18-nm, citrate-capped, spherical AuNPs significantly altered the grazing ability of A. polyphaga, which was not observed in biofilms exposed to 24-nm polystyrene beads. Uptake and replication of NP-exposed planktonic L. pneumophila within A. polyphaga were not altered regardless of NP size or core chemistry. Nanomaterial effects on the interaction of benthic organisms and bacteria may be directly or, as shown here, indirectly dependent on bacterial morphology. NP contamination therefore may alter interactions in a normal ecosystem function.									5	0	0	2	0	5			0095-3628			WOS:000314366900021	23052925

Experiments are presented for a range of canyon aspect ratios and flow Richardson numbers. The dynamics of the mixing is discussed qualitatively and four separate flow regimes are identified. The flow regime observed is shown to be dependent on both the canyon aspect ratio and the flow Richardson number. For taller, narrower canyons and higher Richardson numbers a two-layer stratification is observed throughout the flushing process. For wider canyons and intermediate Richardson numbers the canyon remains stably stratified but no distinct layers are observed. For low Richardson numbers and wide canyons, the canyon is relatively well mixed during the whole flushing process. A regime diagram showing the flow observed in Richardson number-aspect ratio space is presented.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1343-8875			WOS:000313711900006

Specifically, the sufficiency condition for approximating pairs to satisfy the LBB condition established by Stenberg in the Cartesian coordinate setting is presented for the cylindrical coordinate setting. For the cylindrical coordinate setting, the Taylor-Hood (k = 2) and conforming Crouzeix-Raviart elements are shown to be LBB stable. A priori error bounds for approximations to the axisymmetric Stokes flow problem using Taylor-Hood and Crouzeix-Raviart elements are given. The computed numerical convergence rates for the error for an axisymmetric Stokes flow problem support the theoretical results. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Antioxidant activity of carnosine extracted from various poultry tissues								POULTRY SCIENCE				92	2			444	453		10.3382/ps.2012-02480			FEB 2013	2013	The aim of the present research was 1) to extract carnosine from different low economic value poultry tissues and 2) to measure their antioxidant activities using different analytical methods. Low economic value poultry tissues such as the head, liver, lungs, tail, gizzard, brain, and heart were used in this study. Results have indicated that carnosine was present in all the tissue samples investigated. The liver had the highest (102.29 mg/g) and brain the lowest carnosine content (0.95 mg/g; P <= 0.05). Except for the brain, all tissue ultrafiltrates and reconstituted dry powders showed TBA reactive species inhibition ranging from 20.87 to 39.57% and 5.66 -14.47%, respectively. Free radical scavenging activity of ultrafiltrate from all tissues samples ranged from 25.11 to 79.38%, whereas this activity was higher (29.76 to 84.05%) in the reconstituted dry powder of all tissue samples. Conclusions include that extraction of bioactive dipeptide carnosine can be exploited from low economic value poultry tissues to increase the economy of the poultry industry.									4	1	0	4	0	5			0032-5791	1525-3171		WOS:000319313900022	23300312

Such film thicknesses are comparable with or thinner than electron mean-free-path (MFP) in gold. In this size effect regime, skin effect is negligible. The measured results show that the CPWs have less dispersion, but higher loss when compared with thick metal CPWs. A thin film resistivity model, which includes the effects of electron scatterings from metal surfaces, grain boundaries and surface roughness, is proposed to describe the microwave resistance of such CPWs. For an 8 nm CPW, it has much higher resistance and inductance given that 8 nm is around the percolation threshold of gold films. Furthermore, its inductance and resistance decrease with frequencies due to enhanced coupling among metallic islands. The quality factors of nanometer-CPWs are low, especially at low frequencies. Nevertheless, these CPWs have potential applications in local and regional interconnect, biomedical sensors, microwave nanofluidic channels, and disordered-electronic-system studies. Further work is needed to understand and accurately model nanometer CPWs.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1531-1309			WOS:000318501400010

BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION				158				410	419		10.1016/j.biocon.2012.09.019			FEB 2013	2013	Birds migrating to and from breeding grounds in the United States and Canada are killed by the millions in collisions with lighted towers and their guy wires. Avian mortality at towers is highly variable across species, and the importance to each population depends on its size and trajectory. Building on our previous estimate of avian mortality at communication towers, we calculated mortality by species and by regions. To do this, we constructed a database of mortality by species at towers from available records and calculated the mean proportion of each species killed at towers within aggregated Bird Conservation Regions. These proportions were combined with mortality estimates that we previously calculated for those regions. We then compared our estimated bird mortality rates to the estimated populations of these species in the United States and Canada. Neotropical migrants suffer the greatest mortality; 97.4% of birds killed are passerines, mostly warblers (Parulidae, 58.4%), vireos (Vireonidae, 13.4%), thrushes (Turdidae, 7.7%), and sparrows (Emberizidae, 5.8%). Thirteen birds of conservation concern in the United States or Canada suffer annual mortality of 1-9% of their estimated total population. Of these, estimated annual mortality is >2% for Yellow Rail (Coturnicops noveboracensis), Swainson's Warbler (Limnothlypis swainsonii), Pied-billed Grebe (Podilymbus podiceps), Bay-breasted Warbler (Setophaga castanea), Golden-winged Warbler (Vermivora chrysoptera), Worm-eating Warbler (Helmitheros vermivorum), Prairie Warbler (Setophaga discolor), and Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla). Avian mortality from anthropogenic sources is almost always reported in the aggregate ("number of birds killed"), which cannot detect the species-level effects necessary to make conservation assessments. Our approach to per species estimates could be undertaken for other sources of chronic anthropogenic mortality. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

U(VI) was mixed transverse to the direction of flow with hydrogen phosphate (HPO42-), in the presence or absence of calcium (Ca2+) or sulfate (SO42-), in order to identify precipitation rates, morphology and types of minerals formed, and effects of mineral precipitates on pore blockage. Precipitation occurred over the time scale of hours to days. Relative to when only U(VI) and HPO42- were present, precipitation rates were 2.3 times slower when SO42- was present, and 1.4 times faster when Ca2+ was present; larger crystals formed in the presence of SO42-. Raman backscattering spectroscopy and micro-X-ray diffraction results both showed that the only mineral precipitated was chernikovite, UO2HPO4 center dot 4H(2)O; energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy results indicate that Ca and S are not incorporated into the chernikovite lattice. A pore-scale model was developed, and simulation results of saturation ratio (SR = Q/K-sp) suggest that chernikovite is the least thermodynamically favored mineral to precipitate (0 < SR < 1) compared to uranyl hydrogen phosphate and Na-autunite (13 < SR < 40), and uranyl orthophosphate and Ca-autunite (when Ca2+ is present; SR > 10(5)). Fluorescent tracer studies and laser confocal microscopy images showed that densely aggregated precipitates blocked pores and reduced permeability. The results suggest that uranium precipitation with phosphate as chernikovite is rapid on the time scale of remediation for the conditions considered and can block pores, alter fluid flow paths, and potentially limit mixing and precipitation.

However, the effects of introduced species on temporal patterns of soil nutrient availability remain unexplored, which could be critical for invasion where the growing seasons are short. To test the hypothesis that the invasive species could alter seasonal patterns of resource availability via suppression of soil processes through secondary compounds in autumnal litter-fall, we measured nutrient dynamics in soils inside and outside stands of invasive Polygonum cuspidatum at four sites in northeastern US over the growing season. In the uppermost soil (0-5 cm depth), both concentrations of inorganic N and rates of N mineralization were 60% lower inside than outside stands of knotweed in spring but became as high or higher inside than outside by fall. Carbon and nitrogen mineralizing soil microbial enzymes also followed a similar seasonal trend with lower activity inside the knotweed stands than outside during spring and these differences disappearing by summer. Concentrations of dissolved organic N (DON) and phenolic compounds showed the opposite seasonal pattern and a strong correlational trend; they were nearly 3 times higher inside than outside stands in spring and similar inside and outside in fall. The estimated flux of tannins from knotweed litter to soil was calculated as 189.5 +/- 39.2 g m(-2) year(-1). Further, exogenous application of knotweed tannin reduced the soil N-mineralization and paralleled the field observed inhibition of mineralization. At 5-15 cm depth, concentrations of phenolics were uniformly low and differences between soils inside and outside stands were mostly non-significant. Our results suggests that invasion by polyphenol rich, yet fast growing exotic species would make the soil N pools more dynamic, which could facilitate invasion by creating stints of apparent deficiency and sufficiency of resources, and due to the localization of the invader effect the amelioration practices could be focused on the surface 0-5 cm layer of the mineral soil.

To provide insight into how warming and changes in precipitation regimes affect the rate and temperature sensitivity of R-s and rhizosphere respiration (R-r) across the year, we subjected a New England old-field ecosystem to four levels of warming and three levels of precipitation (ambient, drought, and wet treatments). We measured R-s and heterotrophic respiration (R-h) monthly (in areas of the plots with and without plants, respectively) and estimated R-r by calculating the difference in respiration between R-s and R-h. Even in this mesic ecosystem, R-s and R-r responded strongly to the precipitation treatments. Drought reduced R-s and R-r, both annually and during the growing season. Annual cumulative R-s responded nonlinearly to precipitation treatments; both drought and supplemental precipitation suppressed R-s compared to the ambient treatment. Warming increased R-s and R-r in spring and winter when soil moisture was optimal but decreased these rates in summer when moisture was limiting. Cumulative winter R-r increased by about 200% in the high warming (similar to 3.5 degrees C) treatment. The effect of climate treatments on the temperature sensitivity of R-s depended on the season. In the fall, the drought treatment decreased apparent Q(10) relative to the other precipitation treatments. The responses of R-s to warming and altered precipitation were largely driven by changes in R-r. We emphasize the importance of incorporating realistic soil moisture responses into simulations of soil carbon fluxes; the long-term effects of warming on carbon-climate feedback will depend on future precipitation regimes. Our results highlight the nonlinear responses of soil respiration to soil moisture and, to our knowledge, quantify for the first time the loss of carbon through winter rhizosphere respiration due to warming. While this additional loss is small relative to the cumulative annual flux in this system, such increases in rhizosphere respiration during the non-growing season could have greater consequences in ecosystems where they offset or reduce subsequent warming-induced gains in plant growth.									28	2	0	25	0	30			0012-9658			WOS:000316932800016	23691659

The powder constituents were hot pressed at two different temperatures, depending on prior conditioning of the milling vials. SEM and EDS were used to analyze microstructure impurities, and fracture mechanisms. XRD was used to verify proper phase formation and to check for impurity phases. The bulk AlMgB14+ZrB2 and AlMgB14+HfB2 show up to 973% and 98% densification, 222 and 24.5 GPa hardness (measured at 5K-gf), and 4.1 and 3.7 MPa(m)(1/2) toughness, respectively. Also the study of bulk AlMgB14+ZrB2 and AlMgB14+HfB2 composites has shown that these materials exhibit high resistance to erosive and abrasive wear. Multi-hour ASTM erosion tests with Al2O3 abrasive material against composite samples comprised of AlMgB14 (40 vol.%) + ZrB2 (60 vol.%) and AlMgB14 (40 vol.%) +HfB2 (60 vol.%) resulted in erosion rates as low as 4.49 mm(3) of (AlMgB14+ZrB2) wear per kg of erodent and 2.85 mm(3) of (AlMgB14+HfB2) wear per kg of erodent. These values were compared with 14.9 mm(3)/kg for wear-resistant grades of WC-6%Co. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0032-5910			WOS:000316039400118		
J	Hagan, Donald L.; Jose, Shibu; Lin, Chung-Ho								Allelopathic Exudates of Cogongrass (Imperata cylindrica): Implications for the Performance of Native Pine Savanna Plant Species in the Southeastern US								JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY				39	2	SI		312	322		10.1007/s10886-013-0241-z			FEB 2013	2013	We conducted a greenhouse study to assess the effects of cogongrass (Imperata cylindrica) rhizochemicals on a suite of plants native to southeastern US pine savanna ecosystems. Our results indicated a possible allelopathic effect, although it varied by species. A ruderal grass (Andropogon arctatus) and ericaceous shrub (Lyonia ferruginea) were unaffected by irrigation with cogongrass soil "leachate" (relative to leachate from mixed native species), while a mid-successional grass (Aristida stricta Michx. var. beyrichiana) and tree (Pinus elliottii) were negatively affected. For A. stricta, we observed a 35.7 % reduction in aboveground biomass, a 21.9 % reduction in total root length, a 24.6 % reduction in specific root length and a 23.5 % reduction in total mycorrhizal root length, relative to the native leachate treatment. For P. elliottii, there was a 19.5 % reduction in percent mycorrhizal colonization and a 20.1 % reduction in total mycorrhizal root length. Comparisons with a DI water control in year two support the possibility that the treatment effects were due to the negative effects of cogongrass leachate, rather than a facilitative effect from the mixed natives. Chemical analyses identified 12 putative allelopathic compounds (mostly phenolics) in cogongrass leachate. The concentrations of most compounds were significantly lower, if they were present at all, in the native leachate. One compound was an alkaloid with a speculated structure of hexadecahydro-1-azachrysen-8-yl ester (C23H33NO4). This compound was not found in the native leachate. We hypothesize that the observed treatment effects may be attributable, at least partially, to these qualitative and quantitative differences in leachate chemistry.									9	0	0	6	0	9			0098-0331			WOS:000316115900015	23334457

The relationships are derived using published laboratory test data for four different sands and one silt material. The laboratory test data based on V-P exhibit less scatter than the test data based on the ratio V-P/V-S. For this reason, the V-P-based relationship is recommended for correcting the liquefaction resistance of unsaturated soil. The influence of loading cycles and relative density on the recommended relationship is investigated. From a review of 40 field case history sites, it is found that in the critical layers at 20% of the sites, average V-P is less than 1,400 m/s, indicating unsaturated conditions. Liquefaction resistances computed for eight field case histories with V-P < 1,200 m/s in the critical layers are corrected and plotted on penetration-and V-S-based liquefaction evaluation charts. The results support the use of the correction for unsaturated conditions below the groundwater table. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)GT.1943-5606.0000770.

Sediment Pollution Assessment of Abandoned Residential Developments Using Remote Sensing and GIS								PEDOSPHERE				23	1			39	47					FEB 2013	2013	The current economic crisis has left numerous residential developments in the southeastern United States in various stages of construction. Many of them are currently graded and essentially abandoned, creating a major source of sediment runoff to waterways. Residential development locations with significant bare soil areas were identified through classification of Landsat 5 TM satellite imagery and subsequently verified from high-resolution county aerial photographs. The revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) was used in a geographic information system (GIS) as a tool for prioritizing identified locations on the basis of potential soil loss assuming the worst case scenario of a completely unmaintained site. Initial GIS identification indicated 301 sites with a total bare soil area of 2 378 ha over three counties in Upstate South Carolina. A random sample of 153 sites was visited over 17 days and assessed using a mobile GIS, global positioning system (GPS), and digital camera for field validation. Results indicated that 78% (119) of the sites were classified correctly (residential construction sites in varying stages of completion); 88% of identified areas were less than 25% built compared to the previous year; 48% were categorized as moderate to severe problems. Abandoned and unfinished developments in Upstate South Carolina may represent a major source of sediment pollution to streams. Well-maintained erosion control devices may be useful in preventing offsite sedimentation.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1002-0160			WOS:000315076700005

J	Beachley, Vince; Katsanevakis, Eleni; Zhang, Ning; Wen, Xuejun								A Novel Method to Precisely Assemble Loose Nanofiber Structures for Regenerative Medicine Applications								ADVANCED HEALTHCARE MATERIALS				2	2			343	351		10.1002/adhm.201200125			FEB 2013	2013	Polymer nanofibers are favorable for tissue engineering scaffolds because of their high surface-to-volume ratio and biomimicry of the extracellular matrix. Random and uniaxially oriented polymer nanofibers are easily fabricated by conventional electrospinning techniques; however, control over fiber organization within nanofiber structures is limited when they are collected directly from an electrospinning jet. The regenerative medicine applications of electrospun scaffolds could be expanded by developing assembly methods that allow better control of fiber organization. Here, a novel technique is presented that utilizes parallel automated tracks to orient and collect nanofibers from an electrospinning jet. The stabilized fibers are then subsequently assembled into desirable structures. It is difficult to assemble complex structures directly from an electrospinning jet because of high electrical charge and velocities, so this technology adds an intermediate step where nanofibers are immobilized on automated tracks. The result is a continuous steady-state delivery of static stabilized nanofibers that provides a unique and promising platform for automated post processing into useful nanofiber structures. This technique also allows for an indefinite amount of time, as determined by design parameters, for fibers to dry or cool before they contact other nanofibers in the collection site, thus eliminating potential for fiber-to-fiber adhesions even with slow evaporating solvents or high-temperature melts. To demonstrate potential in regenerative medicine applications, several nanofiber structures were fabricated, including: 2D structures with well-controlled fiber density; 3D loosely assembled aligned nanofiber structures with good cell penetration properties; and, complex layer-by-layer 3D aligned fiber structures assembled by integration with post-processing techniques.									6	0	0	1	0	6			2192-2640			WOS:000315122900016	23184622

Kinetics of 1,2-Dichloroethane and 1,2-Dibromoethane Biodegradation in Anaerobic Enrichment Cultures								APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY				79	4			1359	1367		10.1128/AEM.02163-12			FEB 2013	2013	1,2-Dichloroethane (1,2-DCA) and 1,2-dibromoethane (ethylene dibromide [EDB]) contaminate groundwater at many hazardous waste sites. The objectives of this study were to measure yields, maximum specific growth rates ((mu) over cap), and half-saturation coefficients (K-S) in enrichment cultures that use 1,2-DCA and EDB as terminal electron acceptors and lactate as the electron donor and to evaluate if the presence of EDB has an effect on the kinetics of 1,2-DCA dehalogenation and vice versa. Biodegradation was evaluated at the high concentrations found at some industrial sites (>10 mg/liter) and at lower concentrations found at former leaded-gasoline sites (1.9 to 3.7 mg/liter). At higher concentrations, the Dehalococcoides yield was 1 order of magnitude higher when bacteria were grown with 1,2-DCA than when they were grown with EDB, while (mu) over cap 's were similar for the two compounds, ranging from 0.19 to 0.52 day(-1) with 1,2-DCA to 0.28 to 0.36 day(-1) for EDB. K-S was larger for 1,2-DCA (15 to 25 mg/liter) than for EDB (1.8 to 3.7 mg/liter). In treatments that received both compounds, EDB was always consumed first and adversely impacted the kinetics of 1,2-DCA utilization. Furthermore, 1,2-DCA dechlorination was interrupted by the addition of EDB at a concentration 100 times lower than that of the remaining 1,2-DCA; use of 1,2-DCA did not resume until the EDB level decreased close to its maximum contaminant level (MCL). In lower-concentration experiments, the preferential consumption of EDB over 1,2-DCA was confirmed; both compounds were eventually dehalogenated to their respective MCLs (5 mu g/liter for 1,2-DCA, 0.05 mu g/liter for EDB). The enrichment culture grown with 1,2-DCA has the advantage of a more rapid transition to 1,2-DCA after EDB is consumed.									13	0	0	13	0	13			0099-2240			WOS:000314891500034	23263950

Study Design Biomechanical in vitro study. Sample Population Synthetic bone. Methods Twenty mini-anchors were inserted into synthetic bone blocks assigned to 1 of 2 groups (0 degrees ALF, 90 degrees ALF). Pullout was performed at 5mm/min. ALF, yield strength and stiffness were calculated. SA constructs were created with 4 groups of 5 anchors each with either 30lb nylon leader line (NLL), 40lb NLL, #2 Fiberwire or #5 Fiberwire. SA was performed at 0 degrees and 90 degrees with a sinusoidal wave form at 0.5Hz and 10N load for 1000 cycles or until failure. Data were summarized as mean +/- SD. ALF data were analyzed using t-tests. SA data were analyzed using log rank, Tukey-adjusted pairwise comparisons and sign tests. Significance was set at P=.05. Results Mean +/- SD ALF at 0 degrees and 90 degrees was 431.8 +/- 70.8N and 683 +/- 48.7N, respectively. 90 degrees ALF was significantly higher. Yield strength and stiffness were not significantly different at 0 degrees and 90 degrees. #5 and #2 Fiberwire survived significantly more cycles than 40lb and 30lb NLL at 90 degrees. At 0 degrees, 30lb NLL survived significantly less cycles than either Fiberwire size. Suture orientation did not have a significant effect on SA for Fiberwire constructs. Conclusion The novel mini-anchor has ALF comparable to other mini-anchors. Fiberwire survived more cycles in the novel anchor eyelet than NLL and FW suture orientation in the eyelet did not affect SA.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0161-3499			WOS:000314868500014	23373750

A promising approach to localizing drug release is to employ drug-loaded nanoparticles with coatings that release the drugs only in the presence of specific triggers found in the target cells such as pH, enzymes, or light. However, many parameters affect the nanoparticle distribution and drug release rate, and it is difficult to quantify drug release in situ. In this work, we show proof-of-principle for a "smart" radioluminescent nanocapsule with an X-ray excited optical luminescence (XEOL) spectrum that changes during release of the optically absorbing chemotherapy drug, doxorubicin. XEOL provides an almost background-free luminescent signal for measuring drug release from particles irradiated by a narrow X-ray beam. We study in vitro pH-triggered release rates of doxorubicin from nanocapsules coated with a pH-responsive polyelectrolyte multilayer using HPLC and XEOL spectroscopy. The doxorubicin was loaded to over 5% by weight and released from the capsule with a time constant in vitro of similar to 36 days at pH 7.4 and 21 h at pH 5.0, respectively. The Gd2O2S:Eu nanocapsules are also paramagnetic at room temperature with similar magnetic susceptibility and similarly good MRI T-2 relaxivities to Gd2O3, but the sulfur increases the radioluminescence intensity and shifts the spectrum. Empty nanocapsules did not affect cell viability up to concentrations of at least 250 mu g/mL. These empty nanocapsules accumulated in a mouse liver and spleen following tail vein injection and could be observed in vivo using XEOL. The particles are synthesized with a versatile template synthesis technique which allows for control of particle size and shape. The XEOL analysis technique opens the door to noninvasive quantification of drug release as a function of nanoparticle size, shape, surface chemistry, and tissue type.									45	1	0	14	0	46			1936-0851			WOS:000315618700035	23281651

Examining the Prospective Effects of Making a Virginity Pledge Among Males Across Their 4 Years of College								JOURNAL OF AMERICAN COLLEGE HEALTH				61	2			114	120		10.1080/07448481.2012.755188			FEB 1 2013	2013	Objectives: The authors examined prospective associations of making a virginity pledge on sexual behaviors among male college students. Participants: A sample of 795 males was followed for 4years (2008, 2009, 2010, 2011), with response rates ranging from 72% to 82% across the follow-up years. Methods: Males were surveyed at the end of each of their 4years in college about sexual behavior activities and other risky behaviors. Results: Multivariate regression analyses indicated that males who made private virginity pledges were significantly more likely to remain abstinent across all 4years of college and have fewer sexual partners at the end of their third and fourth years of college, even after controlling for age, race, high-risk drinking, impulsivity, and religiosity. Making a pledge was not related to condom use. Conclusion: Findings suggest that abstinence-based messages alone are not sufficient yet should be included as part of comprehensive sex education programs.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0744-8481			WOS:000315773900008	23409861

S. soldiers who had participated in a deployment to Iraq. Soldiers (N = 636) completed assessments at 4 (Time 1) and 10 (Time 2) months following their combat deployment. Combat exposure (both breadth and perceived stressfulness), morale, and PTSD symptoms were assessed at Time 1, and PTSD symptoms were assessed again at Time 2. Results of multivariate multiple regressions revealed that morale at Time 1 interacted with both the breadth and stressfulness of combat exposure to predict PTSD symptoms at both Time 1 and Time 2, even when partialling out the effect of unit support. The slope of the given combat exposure and PTSD symptoms relationship was weaker when reports of morale were higher (with the effect size of the interaction ranging from .01 to .04). The results suggest that morale may buffer soldiers from the negative consequences of combat stressors.									10	2	0	4	0	12			0894-9867			WOS:000315095900012	23371305

The purification techniques currently in use for the manufacturing of low loss ChGs are both laborious and time consuming, often without yielding the desired ultra high optical transparency in the spectral regime of interest. Here we present details of a rapid method for the purification of ChGs based on the simultaneous, microwave assisted melting of the elemental starting materials. Arsenic and selenium reagents are inserted in a domestic microwave oven cavity and irradiated for 5 or 15 min while kept under dynamic vacuum. The As2Se3 glasses prepared with this method show no thermal and structural property discrepancy as compared with conventionally melted glasses. In studies conducted to date we observe a reduction of 100% (i.e. below detection limit) in O-H and H2O, and of similar to 80% in the impurity levels of oxides. We believe the microwave assisted synthesis of ChGs is a significant milestone in the development of a more efficient tool for the manufacture of higher purity materials, with technological spin off expanding beyond the border of ChGs science itself									2	0	0	0	0	2			1753-3562			WOS:000315836300004

It was shown that gene defects resulting in amino acid changes of the wild type SMS cause Snyder-Robinson syndrome, which is a mild-to-moderate mental disability associated with osteoporosis, facial asymmetry, thin habitus, hypotonia, and a nonspecific movement disorder. These disease-causing missense mutations were demonstrated, both in silico and in vitro, to affect the wild type function of SMS by either destabilizing the SMS dimer/monomer or directly affecting the hydrogen bond network of the active site of SMS. In contrast to these studies, here we report an artificial engineering of a more efficient SMS variant by transferring sequence information from another organism. It is confirmed experimentally that the variant, bearing four amino acid substitutions, is catalytically more active than the wild type. The increased functionality is attributed to enhanced monomer stability, lowering the pKa of proton donor catalytic residue, optimized spatial distribution of the electrostatic potential around the SMS with respect to substrates, and increase of the frequency of mechanical vibration of the clefts presumed to be the gates toward the active sites. The study demonstrates that wild type SMS is not particularly evolutionarily optimized with respect to the reaction spermidine R spermine. Having in mind that currently there are no variations (non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism, nsSNP) detected in healthy individuals, it can be speculated that the human SMS function is precisely tuned toward its wild type and any deviation is unwanted and disease-causing.									9	0	0	5	0	9			1553-734X	1553-7358		WOS:000315708600031	23468611

Influence of Aggregate Gradation on the Performance Properties of Porous Asphalt Mixtures								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING				25	2			281	288		10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0000602			FEB 2013	2013	This research investigated the effect of aggregate gradation on the performance of porous asphalt mixtures. Ten aggregate gradations, which represent typical gradations used by 20 different United States highway agencies for open graded friction courses, were compared by evaluating draindown, permeability, Cantabro abrasion loss, indirect tensile strength, and rutting resistance. The results indicated that gradation does influence the performance of porous asphalt mixtures. An increase in the void ratio of the aggregate structure contributes to significant increases in porosity and permeability. Consequently, the indirect tensile strength and durability (as measured by the Cantabro abrasion test) generally decreased as the mixture porosity increased. The 10 mixes showed good moisture resistance characteristics and most of the mixes had no significant difference in tensile strength after the moisture-conditioning procedure. Furthermore, the effects of rutting did not correlate with mixture or aggregate porosity. Based on these results, it is evident that an aggregate gradation for a porous asphalt mixture can be optimized depending upon the performance requirements (permeability or strength) based on the void ratio of the gradation.

The main constituents of the investigated essential oils were as follows: FC: alpha-pinene 68.5% and myrcene 11.9%; MC: alpha-pinene 22.5%, epi-zonarene 9.9%, zonarene 6.9%, limonene 6.8% and cadina-3,5-diene 6.1%; NT: alpha-pinene 20.7%, epi-zonarene 10.4%, zonarene 7.6%, limonene 5.9% umbellulone 5.8% and cadina-3,5-diene 5.8%; WB: alpha-pinene 40.7%, limonene 3.2% and umbellulone 2.9%. Essential oils were evaluated for antifungal activity against the strawberry anthracnose causing fungal plant pathogens Colletotrichum acutatum, C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides. Only WB essential oil showed moderate activity when compared with the commercial antifungal standards. Carolina Sapphire essential oils exhibited biting deterrent activity at 10 mu g/cm(2) with Biting Deterrence Index (BDI) values of 0.64, 0.59, 0.65 and 0.72, for FC, MC, NT and WB, respectively, and were significantly lower (P <= 0.05) than the synthetic insect repellent, DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide), at 25 nmol/cm(2) against Aedes aegypti. The biting deterrence of NT and WB oils at 100 mu g/cm(2) with BDI values of 1.04 and 1.01, respectively, were similar, whereas the activity of MC (BDI=0.88) and PC (BDI=0.62) essential oils was lower than DEET at 25 nmol/cm(2). Essential oil from PC with LD50 of 33.7 ppm was most toxic against 1-day-old Ae. aegypti larvae at 24-h post treatment.

Formation mechanisms and precursors of NDMA are still not well understood. The main objectives of this study were to systematically investigate (i) the effect of tertiary amine structure, (ii) the effect of background natural organic matter (NOM), and (iii) the roles of mono vs. dichloramine species on the NDMA formation. Dimethylamine (DMA) and 20 different tertiary aliphatic and aromatic amines were carefully examined based on their functional groups attached to the basic DMA structure. The wide range (0.02-83.9%) of observed NDMA yields indicated the importance of the structure of tertiary amines, and both stability and electron distribution of the leaving group of tertiary amines on NDMA formation. DMA associated with branched alkyl groups or benzyl like structures having only one carbon between the ring and DMA structure consistently gave higher NDMA yields. Compounds with electron withdrawing groups (EWG) reacted preferentially with monochloramine, whereas compounds with electron donating group (EDG) showed tendency to react with dichloramine to form NDMA. When the selected amines were present in NOM solutions, NDMA formation increased for compounds with EWG while decreased for compounds with EDG. This impact was attributed to the competitions between NOM and amines for chloramine species. The results provided additional information to the commonly accepted mechanism for NDMA formation including chloramine species reacting with tertiary amines and the role of the leaving group on overall NDMA conversion.

J	Darlington, Ramona; Lehmicke, Leo G.; Andrachek, Richard G.; Freedman, David L.								Anaerobic abiotic transformations of cis-1,2-dichloroethene in fractured sandstone								CHEMOSPHERE				90	8			2226	2232		10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.09.084			FEB 2013	2013	A fractured sandstone aquifer at an industrial site is contaminated with trichloroethene to depths greater than 244 m. Field data indicate that trichloroethene is undergoing reduction to cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cDCE); vinyl chloride and ethene are present at much lower concentrations. Transformation of cDCE by pathways other than reductive dechlorination (abiotic and/or biotic) is of interest. Pyrite, which has been linked to abiotic transformation of chlorinated ethenes, is present at varying levels in the sandstone. To evaluate the possible role of pyrite in transforming cDCE, microcosms were prepared with groundwater, similar to 40 mg L-1 cDCE + [C-14]cDCE, and crushed solids (pure pyrite, pyrite-rich sandstone, or typical sandstone). During 120 d of incubation, the highest level of cDCE transformation occurred with typical sandstone (11-14% (CO2)-C-14, 1-3%C-14-soluble products), followed by pyrite-rich sandstone (2-4%(CO2)-C-14, 1%C-14-soluble products) and even lesser amounts with pure pyrite. These results indicate pyrite is not likely the mineral involved in transforming cDCE. A separate experiment using only typical sandstone compared the rate of cDCE transformation in non-sterilized, autoclaved, and propylene-oxide sterilized treatments, with pseudo-first order rate constants of 8.7, 5.4, and 1.0 yr(-1), respectively; however, transformation stopped after several months of incubation. Autoclaving increased the volume of pores, adsorption pore diameter, and surface area in comparison to non-sterilized typical sandstone. Nevertheless, autoclaving was less disruptive than chemical sterilization. The results provide definitive experimental evidence that cDCE undergoes anaerobic abiotic and biotic transformation in typical sandstone, with formation of CO2 and soluble products.

Automatic detection and identification of brown stink bug, Euschistus servus, and southern green stink bug, Nezara viridula, (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae) using intraspecific substrate-borne vibrational signals								COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE				91				154	159		10.1016/j.compag.2012.12.010			FEB 2013	2013	Stink bugs cost the southeastern US cotton industry millions of dollars each year in crop losses and control costs. These losses are reduced by strategic pesticide applications; however, current methods of monitoring these pests for making management decisions are time-consuming and costly. Therefore, improved methods to identify and monitor these bugs must be investigated in order to optimize pesticide applications. One such method would be to exploit the substrate-borne vibrational signals (SBVSs) of these insects. Recordings of SBVS for two prevalent regional pests, the brown stink bug, Euschistus servus, and southern green stink bug, Nezara viridula, were segmented into separate pulses of variable duration based on signal energy. For each pulse, the linear frequency cepstral coefficients, dominant frequency, and duration were calculated and used as features. These features were classified using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a probabilistic neural network (PNN) to discriminate these SBVS from incidental sounds and SBVS of different species from each other. Detection of SBVS generated by brown stink bugs was performed with over 92% accuracy for single male-female pairs with both PNN and GMM and with over 86% accuracy for 30 individuals with both PNN and GMM. Detection of SBVS generated by southern green stink bugs was performed with up to 82.5% accuracy with PNN and 68.0% accuracy with GMM for 30 individuals. Also, both PNN and GMM were over 90% accurate in identifying SBVS of brown and southern green stink bugs. Concurrent detection of SBVS from noise and identification of SBVS of brown and southern green stink bugs was 83.3% accurate using PNN and 71.5% accurate using GMM. These results indicated the capability of detecting and identifying stink bug species using their SBVS. Published by Elsevier B.V.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0168-1699			WOS:000315255500018

A review of the foundational processes that influence beliefs in climate change: opportunities for environmental education research								ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION RESEARCH				19	1			1	20		10.1080/13504622.2012.683389			FEB 1 2013	2013	Recently, many organizations involved in environmental education have initiated programs that aim to educate visitors or other publics who interact with nature-based resources about the impacts and landscape transformations occurring because of climatic changes. However, many psychological, human-evolutionary, and socialecological processes that impede individuals' ability to notice or respond to (e.g. adaptation and mitigation behaviors) climate impacts in nature-based areas, or in their urban-based home communities, may influence the educational process. By reviewing and examining these foundational processes and their potential influence on an audience's attitudes and beliefs towards climate change, we outline and explain their importance for research. Based on these important psychological, human-evolutionary, and socialecological processes, the authors conclude by identifying how researchers can investigate the influence of these processes and their potential impacts on environmental education outcomes.									13	0	0	1	0	13			1350-4622	1469-5871		WOS:000315192700001

The Modern Obesity Epidemic, Ancestral Hunter-Gatherers, and the Sensory/Reward Control of Food Intake								AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGIST				68	2			88	96		10.1037/a0030684			FEB-MAR 2013	2013	Obesity has become a true pandemic. In the United States, over two thirds of adults are obese or overweight. The prevalence of obesity has doubled since 1980. The increase in the prevalence of obese and overweight individuals has happened too rapidly for it to be due to an alteration in the genome. The gastrointestinal, sensory (taste and olfaction), and brain feeding mechanisms that developed during the past 2 million years were highly adaptive for ancestral hunter-gatherers living in an environment with limited high-density foods and periods of food deprivation. Today, however, humans in industrialized countries live in what has been called an "obesogenic environment." The nonhomeostatic brain reward circuitry that was acquired during evolution to seek out and eat as many nutritionally high-dense foods as possible is able to overrule the physiological inhibitory mechanisms that were designed to limit meal size and weight gain.									18	0	0	10	0	18			0003-066X	1935-990X		WOS:000315048400003	23244211

Characterization of Storm Flow Dynamics of Headwater Streams in the South Carolina Lower Coastal Plain. Journal of the American Water Resources Association (JAWRA) 1-14. DOI: 10.1111/jawr.12000 Abstract: Hydrologic monitoring was conducted in two first-order lower coastal plain watersheds in South Carolina, United States, a region with increasing growth and land use change. Storm events over a three-year period were analyzed for direct runoff coefficients (ROC) and the total storm response (TSR) as percent rainfall. ROC calculations utilized an empirical hydrograph separation method that partitioned total streamflow into sustained base flow and direct runoff components. ROC ratios ranged from 0 to 0.32 on the Upper Debidue Creek (UDC) watershed and 0 to 0.57 on Watershed 80 (WS80); TSR results ranged from 0 to 0.93 at UDC and 0.01 to 0.74 at WS80. Variability in event runoff generation was attributed to seasonal trends in water table elevation fluctuation as regulated by evapotranspiration. Groundwater elevation breakpoints for each watershed were identified based on antecedent water table elevation, streamflow, ROCs, and TSRs. These thresholds represent the groundwater elevation above which event runoff generation increased sharply in response to rainfall. For effective coastal land use decision making, baseline watershed hydrology must be understood to serve as a benchmark for management goals, based on both seasonal and event-based surface and groundwater interactions.									3	0	0	1	0	3			1093-474X			WOS:000314755700006		
J	Dragic, Peter D.; Ballato, John; Morris, Stephanie; Hawkins, Thomas								Pockels' coefficients of alumina in aluminosilicate optical fiber								JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA B-OPTICAL PHYSICS				30	2			244	250					FEB 2013	2013	The photoelastic constants of the alumina component in aluminosilicate optical fibers are evaluated and determined to be p(11) = -0.237 +/- 0.020 and p(12) = -0.027 +/- 0.012, thus confirming that the low and negative p(ij) characteristics of bulk alumina are conserved as part of a binary aluminosilicate glass system in optical fiber form. In order to enumerate these values, the strain- and stress-optic coefficients of two fibers (one with an aluminosilicate core and one with a pure silica core) were measured by applying mechanical tension or twist, respectively, to the fibers and measuring changes to an optical system as a function of the mechanical deformation. In the former, the strain- optic coefficient (epsilon OC) is measured directly by recording changes to the free spectral range of a ring fiber laser. In the latter, the stress-optic coefficient (sigma OC) is found by measuring the change in polarization angle after linearly polarized light propagates through a segment of twisted test fiber. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such measurement of its type, i.e., the retrieval of the component photoelastic constants, with their signs, of a multicomponent glass. Binary glass compositions wherein the constituents have opposite signs of the photoelastic constant (such as the aluminosilicates) have the potential to give rise to extremely low values of the Brillouin gain coefficient.

This bug appeared in 2009 in the southeastern United States, where it is closely associated with kudzu, Pueraria montana Lour. [Merr.] variety lobata [Willd.] Maesen & S. Almeida. However, the insect has become a consistent economic pest of soybeans, Glycine max (L.) Merr., and some other leguminous crops in areas where large numbers can build in kudzu, in addition to being a considerable nuisance in urban landscapes where kudzu occurs. The insect has remarkable capacity for movement and has spread rapidly from nine Georgia counties in 2009 to seven states in 2012. Despite being a nuisance in urban areas and a crop pest, high populations of the bug also reduce the biomass of kudzu, which is itself a seriously problematic invasive weed, complicating the status of M. cribraria in its expanded range. Extant predators and a pathogen in the US have been observed attacking kudzu bugs in the laboratory and field, but no parasitism of eggs or nymphs has been observed to date. A single record of parasitism of an adult kudzu bug by a tachinid fly is known from the US, but no other adult parasitism has been observed in the US or elsewhere. Extant enemies may eventually significantly reduce the bug's populations, but at present native enemies appear to be insufficient for the task, and exotic enemies from the kudzu bug's native range may offer the best possibility for effective biological control in the US. Based on the available literature, the best option for an importation biological control program appears to be the platygastrid egg parasitoid Paratelenomus saccharalis (Dodd) because of its apparent host specificity, intimate biological linkages with M. cribraria, and wide geographic distribution in the Eastern Hemisphere. Other natural enemies may eventually emerge as good candidates for importation, but at present P. saccharalis appears to be the most promising.									27	0	0	25	0	28			0003-6862			WOS:000314747000002

Despite the subduction history, the massif has preserved its sedimentary oceanic cover, suggesting that it may have preserved its oceanic structure. It is an exceptional case for studying the evolution of a fragment of the lithosphere from its oceanization to its subduction and then exhumation. We present a field and petrological study retracing the different serpentinization episodes and their impact on the massif structure. The Lanzo massif is composed of slightly serpentinized peridotites (<20% serpentinization) surrounded by an envelope of foliated serpentinites (100% serpentinization) bordered by oceanic metabasalts and metasedimentary rocks. The limit between peridotites and serpentinites defines the front of serpentinization. This limit is sharp: it is marked by the presence of massive serpentinites (80% serpentinization) and, locally, by dykes of metagabbros and mylonitic gabbros. The deformation of these gabbros is contemporaneous with the emplacement of the magma. The presence of early lizardite in the peridotites testifies that serpentinization began during the oceanization, which is confirmed by the presence of meta-ophicarbonates bordering the foliated serpentinite envelope. Two additional generations of serpentine occur in the ultramafic rocks. The first is a prograde antigorite that partially replaced the lizardite and the relict primary minerals of the peridotite during subduction, indicating that serpentinization is an active process at the ridge and in the subduction zone. Locally, this episode is followed by the deserpentinization of antigorite at peak PT (estimated in eclogitized metagabbros at 22.5GPa and 550620 degrees C): it is marked by the crystallization of secondary olivine associated with chlorite and/or antigorite and of clinopyroxene, amphibole and chlorite assemblages. A second antigorite formed during exhumation partially to completely obliterating previous textures in the massive and foliated serpentinites. Serpentinites are an important component of the oceanic lithosphere generated in slow to ultraslow spreading settings, and in these settings, there is a serpentinization gradient with depth in the upper mantle. The seismic Moho limit could correspond to a serpentinization front affecting the mantle. This partially serpentinized zone constitutes a less competent level where, during subduction and exhumation, deformation and fluid circulation are localized. In this zone, the reaction kinetics are increased and the later steps of serpentinization obliterate the evidence of this progressive zone of serpentinization. In the Lanzo massif, this zone fully recrystallized into serpentinite during alpine subduction and collision. Thus, the serpentinite envelope represents the oceanic crust as defined by geophysicists, and the sharp front of serpentinization corresponds to an eclogitized seismic palaeo-Moho.									19	1	0	1	0	19			0263-4929			WOS:000314756800004

To date, however, few of these interventions have used a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach, have targeted both physical activity and healthy eating, and have focused on structural changes in the church.Purpose: To report the results of a group randomized CBPR intervention targeting physical activity and healthy eating in African-American churches.Design: Group RCT. Data were collected from 2007 to 2011. Statistical analyses were conducted in 2012.Setting/participants: Seventy-four African Methodist Episcopal (AME) churches in South Carolina and 1257 members within them participated in the study.Intervention: Churches were randomized to an immediate (intervention) or delayed (control) 15-month intervention that targeted organizational and environmental changes consistent with the structural ecologic model. A CBPR approach guided intervention development. Intervention churches attended a full-day committee training and a full-day cook training. They also received a stipend and 15 months of mailings and technical assistance calls to support intervention implementation.Main outcome measures: Primary outcomes were self-reported moderate-to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA), self-reported fruit and vegetable consumption, and measured blood pressure. Secondary outcomes were self-reported fat-and fiber-related behaviors. Measurements were taken at baseline and 15 months. Intent-to-treat repeated measures ANOVA tested group X time interactions, controlling for church clustering, wave, and size, and participant age, gender, and education. Post hoc ANCOVAs were conducted with measurement completers.Results: There was a significant effect favoring the intervention group in self-reported leisure-time MVPA(d = 0.18, p = 0.02), but no effect for other outcomes. ANCOVA analyses showed an intervention effect for self-reported leisure-time MVPA (d = 0.17, p = 0.03) and self-reported fruit and vegetable consumption (d = 0.17, p = 0.03). Trainings were evaluated very positively (training evaluation item means of 4.2-4.8 on a 5-point scale).Conclusions: This faith-based structural intervention using a CBPR framework showed small but significant increases in self-reported leisure-time MVPA. This program has potential for broad-based dissemination and reach.									24	0	0	7	0	24			0749-3797			WOS:000314067600007	23332327

The effect of molecular composition and structure on the development of porosity in pitch-based activated carbon fibers								CARBON				52				267	277		10.1016/j.carbon.2012.09.028			FEB 2013	2013	Seven oligomeric fractions of well-defined composition and molecular weight distribution were generated via supercritical extraction from an isotropic petroleum pitch (M-50) and used as precursors for the production of activated carbon fibers. Both isotropic and mesophase-containing fractions were produced, so that the effects of molecular order and molecular weight could be separated. Carbonization weight loss was found to gradually decrease with increasing molecular weight (and oligomeric number), with mesophase content not being a significant factor. Similar behavior was observed for activation weight loss when the precursors were isotropic; however, even modest increases in molecular order significantly retarded the activation process and resulted in dramatic drops in specific pore volume. A 100% dimer precursor fraction with an average molecular weight of 480 Da produced activated carbon fibers with the highest (specific) pore volume, and the highest pore volume in the range desired for hydrogen adsorption (6-7 angstrom). Even for isotropic precursors, decreases in pore volume with increasing molecular weight were observed. The incremental pore size distribution generated from the nitrogen adsorption data consisted of discrete peaks, which is consistent with the formation of pores by the removal of short micrographene layers, with each layer being formed from an individual oligomeric molecule.

While many single-factor studies have examined the effects of environmental changes on N mineralization and nitrification, few have examined these effects in a multifactor context or recorded how these effects vary seasonally. In an old-field ecosystem in Massachusetts, USA, we investigated the combined effects of four levels of warming (up to 4 degrees C) and three levels of precipitation (drought, ambient, and wet) on net N mineralization, net nitrification, and potential nitrification. We also examined the treatment effects on the temperature sensitivity of net N mineralization and net nitrification and on the ratio of C mineralization to net N mineralization. During winter, freeze-thaw events, snow depth, and soil freezing depth explained little of the variation in net nitrification and N mineralization rates among treatments. During two years of treatments, warming and altered precipitation rarely influenced the rates of N cycling, and there was no evidence of a seasonal pattern in the responses. In contrast, warming and drought dramatically decreased the apparent Q(10) of net N mineralization and net nitrification, and the warming-induced decrease in apparent Q(10) was more pronounced in ambient and wet treatments than the drought treatment. The ratio of C mineralization to net N mineralization varied over time and was sensitive to the interactive effects of warming and altered precipitation. Although many studies have found that warming tends to accelerate N cycling, our results suggest that warming can have little to no effect on N cycling in some ecosystems. Thus, ecosystem models that assume that warming will consistently increase N mineralization rates and inputs of plant-available N may overestimate the increase in terrestrial productivity and the magnitude of an important negative feedback to climate change.									14	2	0	13	0	17			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000314219200028

Forelimb kinematics during swimming in the pig-nosed turtle, Carettochelys insculpta, compared with other turtle taxa: rowing versus flapping, convergence versus intermediacy								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY				216	4			668	680		10.1242/jeb.079715			FEB 2013	2013	Animals that swim using appendages do so by way of rowing and/or flapping motions. Often considered discrete categories, rowing and flapping are more appropriately regarded as points along a continuum. The pig-nosed turtle, Carettochelys insculpta, is unusual in that it is the only freshwater turtle to have limbs modified into flippers and swim via synchronous forelimb motions that resemble dorsoventral flapping, traits that evolved independently from their presence in sea turtles. We used high-speed videography to quantify forelimb kinematics in C. insculpta and a closely related, highly aquatic rower (Apalone ferox). Comparisons of our new data with those previously collected for a generalized freshwater rower (Trachemys scripta) and a flapping sea turtle (Caretta caretta) allow us to: (1) more precisely quantify and characterize the range of limb motions used by flappers versus rowers, and (2) assess whether the synchronous forelimb motions of C. insculpta can be classified as flapping (i.e. whether they exhibit forelimb kinematics and angles of attack more similar to closely related rowing species or more distantly related flapping sea turtles). We found that the forelimb kinematics of previously recognized rowers (T. scripta and A. ferox) were most similar to each other, but that those of C. insculpta were more similar to rowers than to flapping C. caretta. Nevertheless, of the three freshwater species, C. insculpta was most similar to flapping C. caretta. 'Flapping' in C. insculpta is achieved through humeral kinematics very different from those in C. caretta, with C. insculpta exhibiting significantly more anteroposterior humeral motion and protraction, and significantly less dorsoventral humeral motion and depression. Based on several intermediate kinematic parameters and angle of attack data, C. insculpta may in fact represent a synchronous rower or hybrid rower-flapper, suggesting that traditional views of C. insculpta as a flapper should be revised.									6	0	0	4	0	6			0022-0949			WOS:000314340500019	23125335

EFFECTS OF HIGH-INTENSITY PULSED ELECTRIC FIELD ON ANTIOXIDANT ATTRIBUTES OF HYDROLYSATES DERIVED FROM EGG WHITE PROTEIN								JOURNAL OF FOOD BIOCHEMISTRY				37	1			45	52		10.1111/j.1745-4514.2011.00598.x			FEB 2013	2013	Antioxidant activities, such as 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), free radical scavenging capacity and Fe2+ reducing power ability, of hydrolysates derived from egg white, were used to evaluate the effect of high-intensity pulsed electric field (HIPEF) in terms of its processing parameters including electric field intensity and pulsed number. Under the optimal condition, the antioxidant IC50 value of the hydrolysates on DPPH radicals was 5.69 mg/mL, and its synergistic ratio reached up to 1.76. The effect of the PEF on antioxidant attributes of hydrolysates was observed with a significant increase (P < 0.05) during 24 h. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) confirms the wide molecular distribution of the enzymatic hydrolysates. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS This paper mainly focused on the application of PEF on antioxidant peptide to improve its antioxidant activities. This research initially explores the effects of PEF on molecular weight on antioxidant peptide and provides a novel way to improve the activities of antioxidant. This study can help interested readers to take further insight into the application of PEF and the improvement of antioxidant activities.									5	0	0	2	0	5			0145-8884			WOS:000314173400007

A dual algorithm for the minimum covering weighted ball problem in								JOURNAL OF GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION				55	2			261	278		10.1007/s10898-011-9796-9			FEB 2013	2013	The nonlinear convex programming problem of finding the minimum covering weighted ball of a given finite set of points in is solved by generating a finite sequence of subsets of the points and by finding the minimum covering weighted ball of each subset in the sequence until all points are covered. Each subset has at most n + 1 points and is affinely independent. The radii of the covering weighted balls are strictly increasing. The minimum covering weighted ball of each subset is found by using a directional search along either a ray or a circular arc, starting at the solution to the previous subset. The step size is computed explicitly at each iteration.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0925-5001	1573-2916		WOS:000314278100004

The Role of Prolactin Receptor in GH Signaling in Breast Cancer Cells								MOLECULAR ENDOCRINOLOGY				27	2			266	279		10.1210/me.2012-1297			FEB 2013	2013	GH and prolactin (PRL) are structurally related hormones that exert important effects in disparate target tissues. Their receptors (GHR and PRLR) reside in the cytokine receptor superfamily and share signaling pathways. In humans, GH binds both GHR and PRLR, whereas PRL binds only PRLR. Both hormones and their receptors may be relevant in certain human and rodent cancers, including breast cancer. GH and PRL promote signaling in human T47D breast cancer cells that express both GHR and PRLR. Furthermore, GHR and PRLR associate in a fashion augmented acutely by GH, even though GH primarily activates PRLR, rather than GHR, in these cells. To better understand PRLR's impact, we examined the effects of PRLR knockdown on GHR availability and GH sensitivity in T47D cells. T47D-ShPRLR cells, in which PRLR expression was reduced by stable short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression, were compared with T47D-SCR control cells. PRLR knockdown decreased the rate of GHR proteolytic turnover, yielding GHR protein increase and ensuing sensitization of these cells to GHR signaling events including phosphorylation of GHR, Janus kinase 2, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5). Unlike in T47D-SCR cells, acute GH signaling in T47D-ShPRLR cells was not blocked by the PRLR antagonist G129R but was inhibited by the GHR-specific antagonist, anti-GHR(ext-mAb). Thus, GH's use of GHR rather than PRLR was manifested when PRLR was reduced. In contrast to acute effects, GH incubation for 2 h or longer yielded diminished STAT5 phosphorylation in T47D-ShPRLR cells compared with T47D-SCR, a finding perhaps explained by markedly greater GH-induced GHR down-regulation in cells with diminished PRLR. However, when stimulated with repeated 1-h pulses of GH separated by 3-h washout periods to more faithfully mimic physiological GH pulsatility, T47D-ShPRLR cells exhibited greater transactivation of a STAT5-responsive luciferase reporter than did T47D-SCR cells. Our data suggest that PRLR's presence meaningfully affects GHR use in breast cancer cells.

In particular, we establish that this 'Leray-alpha beta-deconvolution model has an energy cascade with an enhanced energy dissipation that enlarges the microscale of the model relative to the Kolmogorov microscale, but captures more of the small scales than does the Leray-alpha model. These theoretical results are confirmed via numerically determined energy spectra. We also propose and analyze an efficient finite-element algorithm method for the proposed model. In addition to establishing stability of the method, the essential ingredient for any numerical study, we demonstrate convergence to a Navier-Stokes solution. A numerical experiment for the two-dimensional flow around an obstacle is also discussed. Results show that enhancing the Leray-a model with deconvolution and dissipation scale modeling can significantly increase accuracy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The strain-induced change in the film resistance was utilized to perform the quantitative measurement of absolute pressure. The highest sensitivity obtained for a 200 mu m thick PDMS film sensor was 0.23/KPa with a range of 50 mm Hg, which is the best result reported so far, over that range, for any pressure sensor on a flexible membrane. The noise-limited pressure resolution was found to be 0.9 Pa (0.007 mm Hg), and a response time of similar to 200 ms, are the best reported results for these sensors. The ultrahigh sensitivity is attributed to the strain-induced formation of microcracks, the effect of which on the resistance change was found to be highly reversible within a certain pressure range. A physical model correlating the sensitivity with the sensor parameters and crack geometry has been proposed.									16	0	0	2	0	16			0960-1317	1361-6439		WOS:000313752800022

Fenhexamid resistance in Botrytis cinerea from strawberry fields in the Carolinas is associated with four target gene mutations. Plant Dis. 97:271-276. Botrytis cinerea, the causal agent of gray mold disease, is one of the most important pathogens of strawberry. Its control in commercial strawberry fields is largely dependent on the application of fungicides during bloom and fruit maturation. The hydroxyanilide fenhexamid is one of the most frequently used fungicides in the southeast of the United States for gray mold control. It inhibits the 3-ketoreductase (Erg27) of the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway and, due to this site-specific mode of action, is at risk for resistance development. Single-spore isolates were collected from 11 commercial strawberry fields in North and South Carolina and subjected to a conidial germination assay that distinguished sensitive from resistant phenotypes. Of the 214 isolates collected, 16.8% were resistant to fenhexamid. Resistance was found in three of four locations from North Carolina and in four of seven locations from South Carolina, indicating that resistance was widespread. Mutations in Erg27 (T63I, F412S, F412C, and F412I) were associated with resistance, with F412S the predominant and most widespread mutation. In this study, mutations T63I and F412C in field isolates of B. cinerea are described for the first time. Detached fruit studies showed that field rates of Elevate 50 WDG (fenhexamid) controlled sensitive but not resistant isolates carrying any of the four mutations. Resistant isolates produced the same lesion size and number of sporulating lesions on fruit sprayed with Elevate 50 WDG as on untreated controls, showing the fungicide's loss of efficacy against those isolates. A rapid polymerase chain reaction method was developed to quickly and reliably distinguish isolates sensitive or resistant to fenhexamid in the Carolinas and to determine the mutation associated with resistance. The presence of fenhexamid-resistant strains in B. cinerea from strawberry fields in the Carolinas must be considered in future resistance management practices for sustained gray mold control.									18	0	0	16	0	18			0191-2917			WOS:000313756200012

Here, we report the dynamic assembly process of contractile myosin filaments onto myofibrils in a live cardiomyocyte culture during myofibrillogenesis.Methods and results Utilizing a custom-built, two-photon excitation fluorescence and second harmonic generation imaging system equipped with an on-stage incubator, we observed new sarcomere additions in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes during 10 h of on-stage incubation. The new sarcomere additions occurred at the side of existing myofibrils, where we observed mature myofibrils acting as templates, or at the interstice of several separated myofibrils.Conclusions During sarcomeric addition, myosin filaments are assembled onto the premyofibril laterally. This lateral addition, which proceeds stepwise along the axial direction, plays an important role in the accumulation of Z-bodies to form mature Z-disks and in the regulation of sarcomeric alignment during maturation.									12	0	0	9	0	12			0008-6363			WOS:000313827400010	23118131

Travelling with tea: a Tuckerella's tale								EXPERIMENTAL AND APPLIED ACAROLOGY				59	1-2			177	202		10.1007/s10493-012-9627-9			FEB 2013	2013	Tuckerella japonica Ehara appears strongly associated with tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze, Theaceae) and, due to certain cultural practices in tea production, has in fact become a world traveller, accompanying the greatly coveted tea plant as it spread across the planet. The history of tea production and culture, and its arrival in the USA, provides the backdrop for this traveller's tale. Tuckerella japonica is morphologically similar to T. flabellifera Miller, described from Tasmania in Australia from Bedfordia salicina (Labill.) D.G. (Asteraceae). These two species have historically been misidentified as each other, creating inaccuracies in the collection records. The implications of this in terms of host plant lists and world distribution are discussed further, along with their morphological separation. The male and immature stages of T. japonica are described for the first time. Tuckerella xinglongensis Lin and Fu, from tea in China, is considered a junior synonym of T. japonica. The loss of the ancestral prostigmatan condition of three nymphal stages during ontogeny is confirmed for males of T. flabellifera, which do not retain a tritonymphal stage.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0168-8162			WOS:000313653200009	23266716

Heat treatment (HT) of carbon nanofibers at 2500 degrees C significantly improved their graphitic crystallinity and intrinsic transport properties, thereby increasing the EM SE of the nanocomposites. Nanocomposites containing 11 vol% (20 wt%) PR-19 HT displayed a DC electrical conductivity of about 1.0 +/- 0.1 X 101 S/m (n = 4), about 10 orders of magnitude better than that of as-received PR-19 CNF nanocomposites. Over a frequency range of 30 MHz to 1.5 GHz, nanocomposites (2.5 mm thick) containing PR-19 HT displayed EM SE average values of about 14 +/- 2 dB (n = 4). Absorption was determined to be the main EM SE mechanism for the heat-treated CNF nanocomposites. The nanocomposites possessed a modulus of 632 +/- 36 MPa (n = 6) (nominally twice that of pure LLDPE) and a strain-to-failure of 180 +/- 98% (n = 6), indicating that a significant ductility is retained in the nanocomposites. Such nanocomposites display potential as absorptive electromagnetic interference shielding materials for thin films and micromolding. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 2013.

J	Weaver, Justin; Husson, Scott M.; Murphy, Louise; Wickramasinghe, S. Ranil								Anion exchange membrane adsorbers for flow-through polishing steps: Part I. clearance of minute virus of mice								BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOENGINEERING				110	2			491	499		10.1002/bit.24720			FEB 2013	2013	Membrane adsorbers may be a viable alternative to the packed-bed chromatography for clearance of virus, host cell proteins, DNA, and other trace impurities. However, incorporation of membrane adsorbers into manufacturing processes has been slow due to the significant cost associated with obtaining regulatory approval for changes to a manufacturing process. This study has investigated clearance of minute virus of mice (MVM), an 1822?nm parvovirus recognized by the FDA as a model viral impurity. Virus clearance was obtained using three commercially available anion exchange membrane adsorbers: Sartobind Q(R), Mustang Q(R), and ChromaSorb(R). Unlike earlier studies that have focused on a single or few operating conditions, the aim here was to determine the level of virus clearance under a range of operating conditions that could be encountered in industry. The effects of varying pH, NaCl concentration, flow rate, and other competing anionic species present in the feed were determined. The removal capacity of the Sartobind Q and Mustang Q products, which contain quaternary ammonium based ligands, is sensitive to feed conductivity and pH. At conductivities above about 20?mS/cm, a significant decrease in capacity is observed. The capacity of the ChromaSorb product, which contains primary amine based ligands, is much less affected by ionic strength. However the capacity for binding MVM is significantly reduced in the presence of phosphate ions. These differences may be explained in terms of secondary hydrogen bonding interactions that could occur with primary amine based ligands. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2013; 110: 491499.

This contribution describes the clearance of minute virus of mice, DNA, and host cell proteins by three commercially available anion-exchange membranes: Sartobind Q, Mustang Q, and ChromaSorb. The Sartobind Q and Mustang Q products contain quaternary amine ligands; whereas, ChromaSorb contains primary amine based ligands. Performance was evaluated over a range of solution conditions: 0200?mM NaCl, pH 6.09.0, and flow rates of 420?membrane?volumes/min in the presence and absence of up to 50?mM phosphate and acetate. In addition contaminant clearance was determined in the presence and absence of 5?g/L monoclonal antibody. The quaternary amine based ligands depend mainly on Coulombic interactions for removal of negatively charged contaminants. Consequently, performance of Sartobind Q and Mustang Q was compromised at high ionic strength. Primary amine based ligands in ChromaSorb enable high capacities at high ionic strength due to the presence of secondary, hydrogen bonding interactions. However, the presence of hydrogen phosphate ions leads to reduced capacity. Monoclonal antibody recovery using primary amine based anion-exchange ligands may be lower if significant binding occurs due to secondary interactions. The removal of a specific contaminant is affected by the level of removal of the other contaminants. The results of this study may be used to help guide selection of commercially available membrane absorbers for flow-through polishing steps. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2013; 110: 500510.

This study aims to study the speed-dependent packet error rate (PER) of wireless sensor radios on rotating mechanical structures. A series of rotating IEEE 802.15.4 sensor radio transmission experiments and vector network analyzer measurements have been conducted to derive and validate a predictive PER model for a fast rotating sensor radio channel based on channel impulse response measurements. The proposed predictive PER model, including power attenuation, bit error rate (BER) and PER sub-models, captures the channel property of rotating sensors based on the received signal strength and the radio receiving sensitivity. The PER model has accurately predicted the PER profile of sensors on a rotating machine tool spindle as well as a rotating plate of a prototype rotation system. The analysis provides an in-depth understanding of how multipath propagation causes the fast power variation and the resulting speed-dependent PER for wireless sensors on rotating mechanical structures.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1551-3203			WOS:000312839600007

Correlates of Reasons for Not Reporting Rape to Police: Results From a National Telephone Household Probability Sample of Women With Forcible or Drug-or-Alcohol Facilitated/Incapacitated Rape								JOURNAL OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE				28	3			455	473		10.1177/0886260512455515			FEB 2013	2013	Rape tactics, rape incident characteristics, and mental health problems (lifetime depression, PTSD, and substance abuse) were investigated as correlates of eight different reasons for not reporting a rape to police among women who had experienced but did not report a rape to police (n = 441) within a national telephone household probability sample. Rape tactics (nonmutually exclusive) included drug or alcohol-facilitated or incapacitated rape (DAFR/IR; n = 119) and forcible rape (FR; n = 376). Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was conducted to extract a dominant set of patterns among the eight reasons for not reporting, and to reduce the set of dependent variables. PCA results indicated three unique factors: Not Wanting Others to Know, Nonacknowledgment of Rape, and Criminal Justice Concerns. Hierarchical regression analyses showed DAFR/IR and FR were both positively and significantly associated with Criminal Justice Concerns, whereas DAFR/IR, but not FR, was associated with Nonacknowledgment as a reason for not reporting to police. Neither DAFR/IR nor FR emerged as significant predictors of Others Knowing after controlling for fear of death or injury at the time of the incident. Correlations among variables showed that the Criminal Justice Concerns factor was positively related to lifetime depression and PTSD and the Nonacknowledgement factor was negatively related to lifetime PTSD. Findings suggest prevention programs should educate women about the definition of rape, which may include incapacitation due to alcohol or drugs, to increase acknowledgement and decrease barriers to police reporting.									10	0	0	1	0	10			0886-2605			WOS:000312731600001	22976904

As the established sustainability model consists of both quantitative and qualitative factors, the qualitative factors were transformed into numerical values prior to performing the materials selection process, aided by the Preference Selection Index (PSI) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) decision-making/supporting tools. The uniqueness of this study comes from using PCA as a scoring tool which is benchmarked against another scoring tool (PSI): however, both PSI and PCA avoid the bias that typically arises from assigning weights to different design attributes, as it is not necessary to assign a relative importance scheme between candidate materials. In this study, however, the authors detail the potential of this objective selection scheme to balance the technological, economical, societal and ecological constraints in the design of automobile bodies.

Standardized database development for EEG epileptiform transient detection: EEGnet scoring system and machine learning analysis								JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS				212	2			308	316		10.1016/j.jneumeth.2012.11.005			JAN 30 2013	2013	The routine scalp electroencephalogram (rsEEG) is the most common clinical neurophysiology procedure. The most important role of rsEEG is to detect evidence of epilepsy, in the form of epileptiform transients (ETs), also known as spike or sharp wave discharges. Due to the wide variety of morphologies of ETs and their similarity to artifacts and waves that are part of the normal background activity, the task of ET detection is difficult and mistakes are frequently made. The development of reliable computerized detection of ETs in the EEG could assist physicians in interpreting rsEEGs. We report progress in developing a standardized database for testing and training ET detection algorithms. We describe a new version of our EEGnet software system for collecting expert opinion on EEG datasets, a completely web-browser based system. We report results of EEG scoring from a group of 11 board-certified academic clinical neurophysiologists who annotated 30-s excepts from rsEEG recordings from 100 different patients. The scorers had moderate inter-scorer reliability and low to moderate intra-scorer reliability. In order to measure the optimal size of this standardized rsEEG database, we used machine learning models to classify paroxysmal EEG activity in our database into ET and non-ET classes. Based on our results, it appears that our database will need to be larger than its current size. Also, our non-parametric classifier, an artificial neural network, performed better than our parametric Bayesian classifier. Of our feature sets, the wavelet feature set proved most useful for classification. Published by Elsevier B.V.									11	0	0	5	0	11			0165-0270			WOS:000315974200017	23174094

This naringinase had a molecular mass (MW) of 348 kDa and contained four subunits with MWs of 100, 95, 84, and 69 kDa. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that the three larger subunits were beta-D-glucosidases and that the smallest subunit was an alpha-L-rhamnosidase. The naringinase and its alpha-L-rhamnosidase and beta-D-glucosidase subunits all had optimal activities at approximately pH 4 and 50 degrees C, and they were stable between pH 3 and 6 and below 50 degrees C. This naringinase was able to hydrolyze naringin, aesculin, and some other glycosides. The enzyme complex had a K-m value of 0.11 mM and a k(cat)/K-m ratio of 14 034 s(-1) mM(-1) for total naringinase. Its alpha-L-rhamnosidase and beta-D-glucosidase subunits had K-m values of 0.23 and 0.53 mM, respectively, and k(cat)/K-m ratios of 14 146 and 7733 s(-1) m(-1), respectively. These results provide in-depth insight into the structure of the naringinase complex and the hydrolyses of naringin and other glycosides.									6	5	0	4	0	11			0021-8561			WOS:000314492600020	23289582

The information obtained from selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) experiments greatly improves the accuracy of RNA secondary structure prediction. Recently, Das and colleagues [Kladwang, W., et al. (2011) Biochemistry 50, 8049-8056] proposed a "bootstrapping" approach for estimating the variance and helix-by-helix confidence levels of predicted secondary structures based on resampling (randomizing and summing) the measured SHAPE data. We show that the specific resampling approach described by Kladwang et al. introduces systematic errors and underestimates confidence in secondary structure prediction using SHAPE data. Instead, a leave-data-out jackknife approach better estimates the influence of a given experimental data set on SHAPE-directed secondary structure modeling. Even when 35% of the data were left out in the jackknife approach, the confidence levels of SHAPE-directed secondary structure prediction were significantly higher than those calculated by Das and colleagues using bootstrapping. Helix confidence levels were thus underestimated in the recent study, and the resampling approach implemented by Kladwang et al. is not an appropriate metric for evaluating SHAPE-directed secondary structure modeling.									7	0	0	6	0	7			0006-2960			WOS:000314391200003	23286327

However, there is still not an experimental system for genetic studies among basal angiosperms to facilitate comparative studies and functional investigation. It would be desirable to identify a basal angiosperm experimental system that possesses many of the features found in existing plant model systems (e. g., Arabidopsis and Oryza).Results: We have considered all basal angiosperm families for general characteristics important for experimental systems, including availability to the scientific community, growth habit, and membership in a large basal angiosperm group that displays a wide spectrum of phenotypic diversity. Most basal angiosperms are woody or aquatic, thus are not well-suited for large scale cultivation, and were excluded. We further investigated members of Aristolochiaceae for ease of culture, life cycle, genome size, and chromosome number. We demonstrated self-compatibility for Aristolochia elegans and A. fimbriata, and transformation with a GFP reporter construct for Saruma henryi and A. fimbriata. Furthermore, A. fimbriata was easily cultivated with a life cycle of just three months, could be regenerated in a tissue culture system, and had one of the smallest genomes among basal angiosperms. An extensive multi-tissue EST dataset was produced for A. fimbriata that includes over 3.8 million 454 sequence reads.Conclusions: Aristolochia fimbriata has numerous features that facilitate genetic studies and is suggested as a potential model system for use with a wide variety of technologies. Emerging genetic and genomic tools for A. fimbriata and closely related species can aid the investigation of floral biology, developmental genetics, biochemical pathways important in plant-insect interactions as well as human health, and various other features present in early angiosperms.									8	0	0	8	0	8			1471-2229			WOS:000317713400001	23347749

Many tissue-specific genes are involved in the pathogenesis of complex human diseases. However, experimental identification of tissue-specific genes is time consuming and difficult. The accurate predictions of tissue-specific gene targets could provide useful information for biomarker development and drug target identification.Results: In this study, we have developed a machine learning approach for predicting the human tissue-specific genes using microarray expression data. The lists of known tissue-specific genes for different tissues were collected from UniProt database, and the expression data retrieved from the previously compiled dataset according to the lists were used for input vector encoding. Random Forests (RFs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were used to construct accurate classifiers. The RF classifiers were found to outperform SVM models for tissue-specific gene prediction. The results suggest that the candidate genes for brain or liver specific expression can provide valuable information for further experimental studies. Our approach was also applied for identifying tissue-selective gene targets for different types of tissues.Conclusions: A machine learning approach has been developed for accurately identifying the candidate genes for tissue specific/selective expression. The approach provides an efficient way to select some interesting genes for developing new biomedical markers and improve our knowledge of tissue-specific expression.

Saliva viscosity of butterflies is 4-5 times greater than that of water and similar to that of 30%-40% sucrose solutions at 25 degrees C. Hence, viscosity stratification would not be expected when butterflies feed on nectar with 30%-40% sugar concentrations. We did not observe any viscoelastic effects or non-Newtonian behavior of saliva droplets. Thus, butterfly saliva is significantly different rheologically from that of humans, which demonstrates a viscoelastic behavior. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

Sheet samples were processed by seven consecutive ARB cycles, with an overall equivalent strain of 5.6. Mechanical characterization and microstructural examination were carried out on the processed material to track their changes and relationships with regard to one another. Electron microscopy, TEM in particular, revealed significant grain refinement in the material, with submicron microstructure achieved even after one cycle of warm processing. Further processing was shown to progressively fragment the highly elongated grains, ultimately producing a predominantly-equiaxed ultrafine grain structure with an average grain size of similar to 100 nm. Tensile strength and microhardness of the material increased with the number of ARB cycles; the strength-grain size relationship followed the Hall-Petch equation. The overall grain refinement and strengthening levels observed here are close to those reported in the literature for ARB processing of CP-Ti at ambient temperatures. This demonstrates the ability of warm ARE can be as effective as cold ARB, while offering several advantages for industrial utilization. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Four series of experiments for different aspect ratios (eta=0.45, 0.75, 1, 2) were conducted for a range of Richardson numbers. The qualitative and quantitative results are discussed and compared. Increasing the Richardson number and decreasing the canyon aspect ratio resulted in an increasingly strong stratification within the canyon and longer trapping times for the pollutant. The aspect ratio strongly affects the initial flushing mechanics and subsequent flow regime within the canyon. Narrower street canyons limit the width of large-scale vortices in the canyon and hence reduce vertical mixing. Based on the initial Richardson number, for all geometric configurations, three different flow regimes were observed in the canyon. The Richardson number at which there is a transition between these regimes is a function of the canyon geometry.

We have measured photodegradation rate constants of PAHs in bulk deposits of soot particles illuminated with simulated sunlight. The photodegradation rate constants at the surface (k(p)(0)), the effective diffusion coefficients (D-eff), and the light penetration depths (z(0.5)) for PAHs on soot layers of variable thickness were determined by fitting experimental data with a model of coupled photolysis and diffusion. The overall disappearance rates of irradiated low molecular weight PAHs (with 2-3 rings) on soot particles were influenced by fast photodegradation and fast diffusion kinetics, while those of high molecular weight PAHs (with 4 or more rings) were apparently controlled by either the combination of slow photodegradation and slow diffusion kinetics or by very slow diffusion kinetics alone. The value of 45 is more sensitive to the soot layer thickness than the k(p)(0) value. As the thickness of the soot layer increases, the z(0.5) values increase, but the k(p)(0) values are almost constant. The effective diffusion coefficients calculated from dark experiments are generally higher than those from the model fitting method for illumination experiments. Due to the correlation between k(p)(0) and z(0.5) in thinner layers, D-eff should be estimated by an independent method for better accuracy. Despite some limitations of the model used in this study, the fitted parameters were useful for describing empirical results of photodegradation of soot-associated PAHs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Assessment of fouling-resistant membranes for additive-free treatment of high-strength wastewaters								DESALINATION				309				222	230		10.1016/j.desal.2012.10.013			JAN 15 2013	2013	In this contribution, we investigate the use of fouling-resistant and cleanable membranes designed for treatment of oily water in the treatment of high-strength industrial wastewaters that present challenges to classical treatment technologies. Membrane surfaces were characterized by spectroscopy and electron microscopy pre- and post-filtration to determine the extent of fouling. Low molecular weight cutoff membranes showed stable permeate fluxes without the need for intermittent cleaning, characteristic of systems with low degrees of internal fouling. For 100 kDa molecular weight cutoff membranes, flux decline was more severe. While polymer-modified membranes processed similar to 26% more permeate than the unmodified membranes in this case, flux recovery after a membrane cleaning step was low and similar for the unmodified and modified membranes, characteristic of high degrees of internal fouling. All membranes reduced turbidity nearly 100% and chemical oxygen demand was reduced 70-84%. These results indicate that 'tight' ultrafiltration membranes designed for treatment of oily waters can be used for primary treatment of other highly impaired wastewaters, and the use of more 'open' ultrafiltration membranes will require further development and optimization of cleaning protocols.

In this work, phytochemical investigation of litchi pericarp methanol extracts led to the isolation of a novel phenolic, 2-(2-hydroxyl-5-(methoxycarbonyl) phenoxy) benzoic acid, together with kaempferol, isolariciresinol, stigmasterol, butylated hydroxytoluene, 3,4-dihydroxyl benzoate, methyl shikimate and ethyl shikimate. Most were found in litchi pericarp for the first time. Their structures were mainly elucidated by NMR and MS evidences. Antioxidant activities of the eight compounds were determined by a DPPH radical scavenging assay and the results showed that 2-(2-hydroxy-5-(methoxycarbonyl) phenoxy)benzoic acid, kaempferol, isolariciresinol, butylated hydroxytoluene and 3,4-dihydroxy benzoate exhibited good antioxidant activities. An interesting finding was that butylated hydroxytoluene was detected as a natural antioxidant in this work, which was usually taken as a synthesized antioxidant. Furthermore, the novel compound exhibited no inhibitory effects against tyrosinase and alpha-glucosidase activities. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Platinum micro- (phi=25 mu m) and macro- (phi=100 mu m) electrodes were electrochemically activated and chemically modified with 3-aminopropyl-trimethoxysilane (APTMS), functionalized with acryloyl(polyethyleneglycol)-N-hydroxysuccinamide (ACRL-PEG-NHS), dipped into a polyHEMA based hydrogel cocktail and UV cross-linked. Electropolymerization of Py in the presence of GOx produced glucose responsive biotransducers that showed; (i) a 4-fold reduction in sensitivity compared with directly electropolymerized PPy films, (ii) an electropolymerization charge density dependence of biotransducer sensitivity and enzyme activity that was maximal at 1.0 mC/cm(2) with an apparent K-M of 33 mM, (iii) interference screening of ascorbic acid and (iv) a temporal increase in sensitivity with storage over a 17 days period. This method has the ability to precisely and quantitatively add enzyme catalytic bioactivity to metal or semiconductor biointerfaces for applications in biosensors, bioelectronics and bionics.

J	Cao, Li; Meziani, Mohammed J.; Sahu, Sushant; Sun, Ya-Ping								Photoluminescence Properties of Graphene versus Other Carbon Nanomaterials								ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH				46	1	SI		171	180		10.1021/ar300128j			JAN 15 2013	2013	Photoluminescent nanomaterials continue to gamer research attention because of their many applications. For many years, researchers have focused on quantum dots (QDs) of semiconductor nanocrystals for their excellent performance and predictable fluorescence color variations that depend on the sizes of the nanocrystals. Even with these advantages, QDs can present some major limitations, such as the use of heavy metals in the high-performance semiconductor QDs. Therefore, researchers continue to be Interested in developing new QDs or related nanomaterials. Recently, various nanoscale configurations of carbon have emerged as potential new platforms in the development of brightly photoluminescent materials.As a perfect pi-conjugated single sheet, graphene lacks electronic bandgaps and is not photoluminescent. Therefore, researchers have created energy bandgaps within graphene as a strategy to impart fluorescence emissions. Researchers have explored many experimental techniques to introduce bandgaps, such as cutting graphene sheets into small pieces or manipulating then electronic network to form quantum-confined sp(2) "islands" In a graphene sheet, which apparently Involve the formation or exploitation of structural defects. In fact, defects in graphene materials not only play a critical role in the creation of bandgaps for emissive electronic transitions, but also contribute directly to the bright photoluminescence emissions observed in these materials. Researchers have found similar defect-derived photoluminescence In carbon nanotubes and small carbon nanoparticles, dubbed carbon "quantum" dots or "carbon dots". However, they have not systematically examined the emissions properties of these different yet related carbon nanomaterials toward understanding their mechanistic origins.In this Account, we examine the spectroscopic features of the observed photoluminescence emissions in graphene materials. We associate the structural characteristics in the underlying graphene materials with those emission properties as a way of classifying them into two primary categories: emissions that originate from created or induced energy bandgaps in a single graphene sheet and emissions that are associated with defects in single- and/or multiple-layer graphene. We highlight the similarities and differences between the observed photoluminescence properties of graphene materials and those found in other carbon nanomaterials including carbon dots and surface defect-passivated carbon nanotubes, and we discuss their mechanistic implications.									207	5	0	29	0	209			0001-4842			WOS:000313667600018	23092181

Combined HPLC/HPSEC study of Suwannee River Fulvic Acid adsorptive fractionation on alpha-aluminum oxide								JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE				390				242	249		10.1016/j.jcis.2012.09.053			JAN 15 2013	2013	A novel liquid chromatographic (LC) method with repeated injections of Suwannee River Fulvic Acid (SRFA) was used to investigate its adsorptive fractionation by synthetic alpha-Al2O3. Eluent (i.e., non-retained) SRFA for each injection was monitored by two ultraviolet (UV) absorbance detection channels (300 and 365 nm) and one fluorescence detection channel (lambda(ex) = 350 nm, lambda(em) = 450 nm). Preferential adsorption of SRFA constituents was revealed by the different responses of the three LC detection channels. Samples of non-retained SRFA from injections of three independent replicate experiments were collected and aggregated for subsequent analysis by steady state ultraviolet-visible (UV/vis) absorption spectrometry and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The ratio of absorbance at 254 and 204 nm, a surrogate for specific UV absorbance at 254 nm, increased with increasing injection number for the non-retained SRFA, indicating the preferential adsorption of SRFA constituents containing aromatic moieties. SEC analysis confirmed the preferential adsorption of higher molecular weight (MW) SRFA constituents as the non-adsorbed SRFA fractions increased in MW across the series of injections. The SEC results also suggested that certain SRFA constituents in the ca. 2-5 kDa MW range adsorbed in early injections were displaced by higher MW species (ca. 5-10 kDa) in later injections.

The X-ray and radio emission are coupled in such Galactic sources; the radio emission originates in a relativistic jet thought to be launched from the innermost regions near the black hole(4,5), with the most powerful emission occurring when the rate of infalling matter approaches a theoretical maximum (the Eddington limit). Only four such maximal sources are known in the Milky Way(6), and the absorption of soft X-rays in the interstellar medium hinders the determination of the causal sequence of events that leads to the ejection of the jet. Here we report radio and X-ray observations of a bright new X-ray source in the nearby galaxy M 31, whose peak luminosity exceeded 10(39) erg s(-1). The radio luminosity is extremely high and shows variability on a timescale of tens of minutes, arguing that the source is highly compact and powered by accretion close to the Eddington limit onto a black hole of stellar mass. Continued radio and X-ray monitoring of such sources should reveal the causal relationship between the accretion flow and the powerful jet emission.									56	1	0	2	0	56			0028-0836			WOS:000313259600032	23235823

Three generic characteristics of the Luttinger liquid are observed: power law behavior of the k-integrated spectral function down to temperatures just above the superconducting transition, k-resolved lineshapes that show holon and spinon features, and quantum critical (QC) scaling in the lineshapes. Departures of the lineshapes and the scaling from expectations in the Tomonaga-Luttinger model can be partially described by a phenomenological momentum broadening that is presented and discussed. The possibility that some form of 1D physics obtains even down to the superconducting transition temperature is assessed.									10	0	0	1	0	10			0953-8984			WOS:000312105900009	23221164

In the entire temperature range the suppression of the density of states at the Fermi energy can be fitted very well by a model describing the tunnelling into a Luttinger liquid at ambient temperature. The power-law exponent extracted from these fits reveals a significant increase above 200 K. It changes from alpha = 0.6 at low temperature to alpha = 1.0 at room temperature.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0953-8984			WOS:000312105900010	23221173

Selectivity of the Highly Preorganized Tetradentate Ligand 2,9-Di(pyrid-2-yl)-1,10-phenanthroline for Metal Ions in Aqueous Solution, Including Lanthanide(III) Ions and the Uranyl(VI) Cation								INORGANIC CHEMISTRY				52	1			15	27		10.1021/ic3002509			JAN 7 2013	2013	Some metal ion complexing properties of DPP (2,9-Di(pyrid-2-yl)-1,10-phenanthroline) are reported with a variety of Ln(III) (Lanthanide(III)) ions and alkali earth metal ions, as well as the uranyl(VI) cation. The intense pi-pi* transitions in the absorption spectra of aqueous solutions of 10(-5) M DPP were monitored as a function of pH and metal ion concentration to determine formation constants of the alkali-earth metal ions and Ln(III) (Ln = lanthanide) ions. It was found that log K-1(DPP) for the Ln(III) ions has a peak at Ln(III) = Sm(III) in a plot of log K-1 versus 1/r(+) (r(+) = ionic radius for 8-coordination). For Ln(M) ions larger than Sm(M), there is a steady rise in log K-1 from La(III) to Sm(III), while for Ln(III) ions smaller than Sm(III), log K-1 decreases slightly to the smallest Ln(II) ion, Lu(III). This pattern of variation of log K-1 with varying size of Ln(III) ion was analyzed using MM (molecular mechanics) and DFT (density functional theory) calculations. Values of strain energy (Sigma U) were calculated for the [Ln(DPP)(H2O)(5)](3+) and [Ln(qpy)(H2O)(5)](3+) (qpy = quaterpyrdine) complexes of all the Ln(III) ions. The ideal M-N bond lengths used for the Ln(II) ions were the average of those found in the CSD (Cambridge Structural Database) for the complexes of each of the Ln(III) ions with polypyridyl ligands. Similarly, the ideal M-O bond lengths were those for complexes of the Ln(III) ions with coordinated aqua ligands in the CSD. The MM calculations suggested that in a plot of Sigma U versus ideal M-N length, a minimum in Sigma U occurred at Pm(III), adjacent in the series to Sm(III). The significance of this result is that (1) MM calculations suggest that a similar metal ion size preference will occur for all polypyridyl-type ligands, including those containing triazine groups, that are being developed as solvent extractants in the separation of Am(III) and Ln(III) ions in the treatment of nuclear waste, and (2) Am(III) is very close in M-N bond lengths to Pm(III), so that an important aspect of the selectivity of polypyridyl type ligands for Am(III) will depend on the above metal ion size-based selectivity. The selectivity patterns of DPP with the alkali-earth metal ions shows a similar preference for Ca(II), which has the most appropriate M-N lengths. The structures of DPP complexes of Zn(II) and Bi(II), as representative of a small and of a large metal ion respectively, are reported. [Zn(DPP)(2)](ClO4)(2) (triclinic, P1, R = 0.0507) has a six-coordinate Zn(II), with each of the two DPP ligands having one noncoordinated pyridyl group appearing to be pi-stacked on the central aromatic ring of the other DPP ligand. [Bi(DPP)(H2O)(2)(ClO4)(2)](ClO4) (triclinic, P1, R = 0.0709) has an eight-coordinate Bi, with the coordination sphere composed of the four N donors of the DPP ligand, two coordinated water molecules, and the O donors of two unidentate perchlorates. As is usually the case with Bi(II), there is a gap in the coordination sphere that appears to be the position of a lone pair of electrons on the other side of the Bi from the DPP ligand. The Bi-L bonds become relatively longer as one moves from the side of the Bi containg the DPP to the side where the lone pair is thought to be situated.A DFT analysis of [Ln(tpy)(H2O)(n)](3+) and [Ln(DPP)(H2O)(5)](3+) complexes is reported. The structures predicted by DFT are shown to match very well with the literature crystal structures for the [Ln(tpy)(H2O)](3+) with Ln = La and n = 6, and Ln = Lu with n = S. This then gives one confidence that the structures for the DPP complexes generated by DFT are accurate. The structures generated by DFT for the [Ln(DPP)(H2O)(5)](3+) complexes are shown to agree very well with those generated by MM, giving one confidence in the accuracy of the latter. An analysis of the DFT and MM structures shows the decreasing O-O nonbonded distances as one progresses from La to Lu, with these distances being much less than the sum of the van der Waals radii for the smaller Ln(III) ions. The effect that such short O-O nonbonded distances has on thermodynamic complex stability and coordination number is then discussed.									13	0	0	0	0	13			0020-1669			WOS:000313220500006	23231454

Two ternary alkali hafnium fluorides are described: Li2HfF6 in space group P (3) over bar 1m with a = 4.9748(7) angstrom and c = 4.6449(9) angstrom and Na5Hf2F13 in space group C2/m with a = 11.627(2) angstrom, b = 5.5159(11) angstrom, and c = 8.4317(17) angstrom. Three new alkali hafnium oxyfluorides are also described: two fluoroelpasolites, K3HfOF5 and (NH4)(3)HfOF5, in space group Fm (3) over barm with a = 8.9766(10) and 9.4144(11) angstrom, respectively, and K2Hf3OF12 in space group R (3) over barm with a = 7.6486(11) angstrom and c = 28.802(6) angstrom. Infrared (IR) spectra were obtained for the title solids to confirm the structure solutions. Comparison of these materials was made based on their structures and synthesis conditions. The formation of these species in hydrothermal fluids appears to be dependent upon both the concentration of the alkali fluoride mineralizer solution and the reaction temperature. Both X-ray and visible fluorescence studies were conducted on compounds synthesized in this study and showed that fluorescence was affected by a variety of factors, such as alkali metal size, the presence/absence of oxygen in the compound, and the coordination environment of Hf4+.									7	0	2	0	0	9			0020-1669			WOS:000313220500027	23245214	
J	Cullen, Joshua A.; Maie, Takashi; Schoenfuss, Heiko L.; Blob, Richard W.								Evolutionary Novelty versus Exaptation: Oral Kinematics in Feeding versus Climbing in the Waterfall-Climbing Hawaiian Goby Sicyopterus stimpsoni								PLOS ONE				8	1					e53274	10.1371/journal.pone.0053274			JAN 4 2013	2013	Species exposed to extreme environments often exhibit distinctive traits that help meet the demands of such habitats. Such traits could evolve independently, but under intense selective pressures of extreme environments some existing structures or behaviors might be coopted to meet specialized demands, evolving via the process of exaptation. We evaluated the potential for exaptation to have operated in the evolution of novel behaviors of the waterfall-climbing gobiid fish genus Sicyopterus. These fish use an "inching'' behavior to climb waterfalls, in which an oral sucker is cyclically protruded and attached to the climbing surface. They also exhibit a distinctive feeding behavior, in which the premaxilla is cyclically protruded to scrape diatoms from the substrate. Given the similarity of these patterns, we hypothesized that one might have been coopted from the other. To evaluate this, we filmed climbing and feeding in Sicyopterus stimpsoni from Hawai'i, and measured oral kinematics for two comparisons. First, we compared feeding kinematics of S. stimpsoni with those for two suction feeding gobiids (Awaous guamensis and Lentipes concolor), assessing what novel jaw movements were required for algal grazing. Second, we quantified the similarity of oral kinematics between feeding and climbing in S. stimpsoni, evaluating the potential for either to represent an exaptation from the other. Premaxillary movements showed the greatest differences between scraping and suction feeding taxa. Between feeding and climbing, overall profiles of oral kinematics matched closely for most variables in S. stimpsoni, with only a few showing significant differences in maximum values. Although current data cannot resolve whether oral movements for climbing were coopted from feeding, or feeding movements coopted from climbing, similarities between feeding and climbing kinematics in S. stimpsoni are consistent with evidence of exaptation, with modifications, between these behaviors. Such comparisons can provide insight into the evolutionary mechanisms facilitating exploitation of extreme habitats.									3	0	0	3	0	3			1932-6203			WOS:000313670100030	23308184	
R			Clemson University						Transcriptome of the Wood-Degrading Fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium Grown on Red Oak								European Nucleotide Archive														2016-03-18	2013	As part of an effort to determine all the gene products involved in wood degradation, we have performed massively parallel pyrosequencing on an expression library from the white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium grown in shallow stationary cultures with red oak as the carbon source. Approximately 48,000 high quality sequence tags (246 bp average length) were generated. 53% of the sequence tags aligned to 4,262 P. chrysosporium gene models, and an additional 18.5% of the tags reliably aligned to the P. chrysosporium genome providing evidence for 961 putative novel fragmented gene models. Due to their role in lignocellulose degradation, the secreted proteins were focused upon. Our results show that the four enzymes required for cellulose degradation: endocellulase, exocellulase CBHI, exocellulase CBHII, and beta-glucosidase are all produced. For hemicellulose degradation, not all known enzymes were produced, but endoxylanases, acetyl xylan esterases and mannosidases were detected. For lignin degradation, the role of peroxidases has been questioned; however, our results show that lignin peroxidase is highly expressed along with the H(2)O(2) generating enzyme, alcohol oxidase. The transcriptome snapshot reveals that H(2)O(2) generation and utilization are central in wood degradation. Our results also reveal new transcripts that encode extracellular proteins with no known function.									1	0	0	1	0	1						DRCI:DATA2016188009590064

J	Belotti, Pietro; Kirches, Christian; Leyffer, Sven; Linderoth, Jeff; Luedtke, James; Mahajan, Ashutosh								Mixed-integer nonlinear optimization								ACTA NUMERICA				22				1	131		10.1017/S0962492913000032			2013	2013	Many optimal decision problems in scientific, engineering, and public sector applications involve both discrete decisions and nonlinear system dynamics that affect the quality of the final design or plan. These decision problems lead to mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems that combine the combinatorial difficulty of optimizing over discrete variable sets with the challenges of handling nonlinear functions. We review models and applications of MINLP, and survey the state of the art in methods for solving this challenging class of problems.Most solution methods for MINLP apply some form of tree search. We distinguish two broad classes of methods: single-tree and multitree methods. We discuss these two classes of methods first in the case where the underlying problem functions are convex. Classical single-tree methods include nonlinear branch-and-bound and branch-and-cut methods, while classical multitree methods include outer approximation and Benders decomposition. The most efficient class of methods for convex MINLP are hybrid methods that combine the strengths of both classes of classical techniques.Non-convex MINLPs pose additional challenges, because they contain non-convex functions in the objective function or the constraints; hence even when the integer variables are relaxed to be continuous, the feasible region is generally non-convex, resulting in many local minima. We discuss a range of approaches for tackling this challenging class of problems, including piecewise linear approximations, generic strategies for obtaining convex relaxations for non-convex functions, spatial branch-and-bound methods, and a small sample of techniques that exploit particular types of non-convex structures to obtain improved convex relaxations.We finish our survey with a brief discussion of three important aspects of MINLP. First, we review heuristic techniques that can obtain good feasible solution in situations where the search-tree has grown too large or we require real-time solutions. Second, we describe an emerging area of mixed-integer optimal control that adds systems of ordinary differential equations to MINLP. Third, we survey the state of the art in software for MINLP.									47	1	0	0	0	48			0962-4929	1474-0508		WOS:000344811600001

Strong magnetic fields generated in the trailing jet shock lead to transverse deflection and acceleration of the electrons. We have self-consistently calculated the radiation from the electrons accelerated in the turbulent magnetic fields for different jet Lorentz factors. We find that the synthetic spectra depend on the bulk Lorentz factor of the jet, the jet temperature, and the strength of the magnetic fields generated in the shock. We have investigated the generation of magnetic fields associated with velocity shear between an unmagnetized relativistic (core) jet and an unmagnetized sheath plasma. We discuss particle acceleration in collimation shocks for AGN jets formed by relativistic MHD simulations. Our calculated spectra should lead to a better understanding of the complex time evolution and/or spectral structure from gamma-ray bursts, relativistic jets, and supernova remnants.

While the error cone is one of the primary tools used by officials, and the general public, to make emergency response decisions, the uncertainty underlying this display can be easily misunderstood. This paper explores the design of an alternate display that provides a continually updated set of possible hurricane tracks, whose ensemble distribution closely matches the underlying statistics of a hurricane prediction. We explain the underlying algorithm and data structures, and demonstrate how our displays compare with the error cone. Finally, we review the design and results of a user study that we conducted as a preliminary test of the efficacy of our approach in communicating prediction uncertainty.									18	0	0	0	0	18			2152-5080	2152-5099		WOS:000343414600004

Satellite transmitters were fitted to eight Canada Geese at Santee National Wildlife Refuge during the winter of 2009-2010. Canada Geese departed Santee National Wildlife Refuge between 5 and 7 March 2010. Six Canada Geese followed a route that included stopovers in northeastern North Carolina and western New York, with three of those birds completing spring migration to breeding grounds associated with the Atlantic Population (AP). The mean distance between stopover sites along this route was 417 km, the mean total migration distance was 2838 km, and the Canada Geese arrived on AP breeding grounds on the eastern shore of Hudson Bay between 20 and 24 May 2010. Two Canada Geese followed a different route from that described above, with stopovers in northeastern Ohio, prior to arriving on the breeding grounds on 9 June 2010. Mean distance between stopover sites was 402 and 365 km for these two birds, and total migration distance was 4020 and 3650 km. These data represent the first efforts to track migratory Canada geese from the southernmost extent of their current wintering range in the Atlantic Flyway. We did not track any Canada Geese to breeding grounds associated with the Southern James Bay Population. Caution should be used in the interpretation of this finding, however, because of the small sample size. We demonstrated that migratory Canada Geese wintering in South Carolina use at least two migratory pathways and that an affiliation with the Atlantic Population breeding ground exists.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0008-3550			BCI:BCI201400772219

There is a lack of consistency in the assembly time analysis performed by planners. The decision support system that was developed in this research is based on mapping controlled language assembly work instructions to Methods-Time Measurement (MTM) tables. Automated analysis of historical work instructions and their related time study analysis were performed by employing knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) algorithms through the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) interface. As a result of this automated analysis, forty-six mapping rules were created that related work instructions to MTM tables and the data backbone for the decision support system that was created. Analyzing large sets of historical data is crucial while creating decision support systems. KDD provides a sustainable method of analyzing big data. Future work of this research includes applying the KDD process to create data backbones for decision support systems to aid in ergonomic evaluations. (C) 2013 The Authors.

In this paper, we test 5 feature sets derived from a group of morphology-based wavelet features and compare the results with that of a Guler-suggested feature set. We also implement a multiple-mother-wavelet strategy and compare performance with the usual single-mother-wavelet strategy. The results indicate that both the derived features and the multiple-mother-wavelet strategy improved classifier performance, using a variety of performance measures. We assess the statistical significance of the performance improvement of the new feature sets/strategy. In most cases, the performance improvement is either significant or highly significant.					35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)35th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	JUL 03-07, 2013JUL 03-07, 2013	IEEE Engn Med Biol Soc; Japanese Soc Med & Biol EngnIEEE Engn Med Biol Soc; Japanese Soc Med & Biol Engn	Osaka, JAPANOsaka, JAPAN	0	0	0	0	0	0			1557-170X		978-1-4577-0216-7	WOS:000341702106101

This challenge is driven by the increasing demand in achieving high performance, low power, and reconfigurable applications onto the same platform. As a consequence, there is an emerging need for fast, and efficient design space exploration, while providing abstract models for a wide range of applications, and types of processing units (PUs).Therefore, this paper proposes a framework for a fast MPSoC generation with joint task and core mapping with the objective of minimizing the average power consumption. The proposed framework considers the static, dynamic, reconfiguration and communication power components. A tool for high level MPSoC task and core mapping (MPMAP) is built based on the proposed framework. MPMAP provides a flexible XML interface that provides a high level description of the different PU architectures, and different applications scenarios. Additionally, the paper presents a case study of real-life applications that can be adopted in future heterogeneous wireless systems.					47th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers47th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers	NOV 03-06, 2013NOV 03-06, 2013	IEEE Signal Proc SocIEEE Signal Proc Soc	Pacific Grove, CAPacific Grove, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0			1058-6393		978-1-4799-2390-8	WOS:000341772900323

However, variations in tire/wheel technologies have resulted in lower torsional stiffnesses that cannot be captured well using these rigid wheel assumptions. This paper presents an adaptive nonlinear controller based on a model that incorporates sidewall flexibility, and transient & hysteretic tread-ground friction effects. The sidewall stiffness and damping and as well as tread parameters are assumed to be unknown and subsequently estimated through a set of gradient-based adaptation laws. A virtual damper is introduced via a backstepping controller design to address difficulties associated with tires with low torsional damping.

Our approach uses both geometric and color information in a direct manner that uses all the data in order to perform the association of data between two RGBD point clouds. Data association is performed by aligning the two color images associated with the two point clouds by estimating a projective warp using the Lucas-Kanade algorithm. This projective warp is then used to create a correspondence map between the two point clouds, which is then used as the data association for a point-to-plane error minimization. This approach to correspondence allows camera tracking to be maintained through areas of low geometric features. We show that our proposed LKDA data association technique enables accurate scene reconstruction in environments in which low geometric texture causes the existing approach to fail, while at the same time demonstrating that the new technique does not adversely affect results in environments in which the existing technique succeeds.

The object segmentation process is improved by using graph cuts along with a skin detector. We introduce an automatic mesh generator that provides a triangular mesh encapsulating the entire non-rigid object without predefined values. Our approach also handles in-plane rotation by reinitializing the mesh after data has been lost in the image sequence. Results display the proposed algorithm over a dataset consisting of seven shirts, two pairs of shorts, two posters, and a pair of pants.

Controllers have been proposed that exploit the null-space of redundant continuum manipulators, however studies of the nature of continuum robot null-spaces have not yet been done. In this paper, we first develop a convenient set of extensible, continuum manipulator forward kinematics and resolved-motion rate inverse kinematics.

S	Willimon, Bryan; Walker, Ian; Birchfield, Stan			IEEE					A New Approach to Clothing Classification using Mid-Level Layers								2013 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ROBOTICS AND AUTOMATION (ICRA)		IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation ICRA						4271	4278					2013	2013	We present a novel approach for classifying items from a pile of laundry. The classification procedure exploits color, texture, shape, and edge information from 2D and 3D local and global information for each article of clothing using a Kinect sensor. The key contribution of this paper is a novel method of classifying clothing which we term L-M-H, more specifically L-C-S-H using characteristics and selection masks. Essentially, the method decomposes the problem into high (H), low (L) and multiple mid-level (characteristics(C), selection masks(S)) layers and produces "local" solutions to solve the global classification problem. Experiments demonstrate the ability of the system to efficiently classify and label into one of three categories (shirts, socks, or dresses). These results show that, on average, the classification rates, using this new approach with mid-level layers, achieve a true positive rate of 90%.

To date, methodologists have yet to agree upon a best practice for detecting and controlling for CMV. In a recent paper, the unmeasured latent marker variable approach, a frequently employed technique, was shown to be incapable of detecting or controlling CMV in PLS analyses. Unfortunately, this was the only method to date suggested for handling CMV in PLS models. To fill this gap, we introduce a measured latent marker variable (MLMV) approach and demonstrate how it is able to both detect and correct for CMV when using Partial Least Squares.					7th Meeting of the Partial Least Squares (PLS)7th Meeting of the Partial Least Squares (PLS)	MAY 19-22, 2012MAY 19-22, 2012		Univ Texas, Houston, TXUniv Texas, Houston, TX	6	0	0	0	1	7			2194-1009		978-1-4614-8282-6; 978-1-4614-8283-3	WOS:000337590300016

In this paper, a control scheme for infrared drying of waterborne coatings is outlined and demonstrated. The drying process model, which is described by a coupled system of a nonlinear partial differential equation for moisture content and a nonlinear ordinary differential equation for coating temperature, is first reduced to a system of nonlinear ODEs using the POD-Galerkin method. Then, a nonlinear model predictive control framework is devised to track a prescribed moisture removal profile during the drying process, while optimizing energy consumption and quality criteria. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated using system simulations.

A DDPM uses solenoid-controlled valves for each cylinder. This provision offers flexibility of control that can be exploited to boost system efficiency by matching individual cylinder operations with load conditions. However, the added complexity from individual cylinder control necessitates mechanisms for fault diagnosis and control reconfiguration to ensure reliable operation of the DDPM. Furthermore, available measurements are often limited to supply and return line pressures, shaft angle and speed. In this paper, it is shown that, with only these measurements, individual cylinder faults are structurally unobservable and unisolable by the use of a system model relating the cylinder faults to the shaft dynamics. To overcome this difficulty, the phase angles at which possible individual cylinder faults can begin to affect the shaft dynamics are tabulated for each cylinder, and a fault indicator that is akin to a shaft acceleration fault is modeled and estimated via a fast sliding mode observer. Simultaneous detection and isolation of individual cylinder faults can be achieved using this fault indicator and a table of fault begin angles. Illustrative examples are included from simulations of a 5 cylinder DDPM to demonstrate this diagnosis process.

ISRN orthopedics				2013				398298	398298		10.1155/2013/398298			2013	2013	Background. Traditionally, osteolysis around total knee replacements (TKRs) is treated with complete revision. In certain subsets, polyethylene insert exchange and bone grafting may be applicable. This study reports the clinical outcomes for selective bone grafting in patients with osteolysis without complete revision of the TKR. Methods. This retrospective study analyzes 10 TKRs (9 patients, 66.5 ± 6.1 years old) presenting with osteolysis and revised after 8.7 ± 1.9 years of in vivo function. At index TKR, all patients were implanted with uncemented prosthesis and modular polyethylene insert with anteroposterior articular constraint (Ultracongruent, Natural Knee II, Sulzer Medica). The surgical technique for treating the osteolysis included removal of necrotic bone tissue using curettage, filling of the defect with bone graft materials, and polyethylene insert exchange. Results. Patients have not exhibited any further complications associated with osteolysis after 5.1 ± 2.4 years of followup. Routine radiographic exams show total incorporation of the graft material into the previously lytic regions in all patients. Conclusion. In some TKRs with osteolysis and firmly fixed components, the removal of lytic tissue and subsequent defect filling with bone graft materials can be a viable solution. This case series shows complete resolution of osteolysis in all patients with no complications.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2090-6161			MEDLINE:24959358	24959358

An extensible framework that allows various workflows has been constructed and used to conduct preliminary analysis of one of the facility's test benches. The framework dictates that component and subsystem models be developed according to a list of identified needs and modeled in software best suited for the particular task. Models are then integrated according to the desired execution target. This approach allows for compartmentalized model development which is well suited for collaborative work. The framework has been applied to one of the test benches and has allowed researches to begin characterizing its behavior in the time and frequency domain.

In Facebook, each datacenter has a full copy of all data and the master datacenter updates all other datacenters, which obviously generates tremendous load in this new model. Distributed data storage that only stores a user's data to his/her geographically-closest datacenters mitigates the problem. However, frequent interactions between far-away users lead to frequent inter-datacenter communication and hence long service latency. In this paper, we aim to reduce inter-datacenter communications while still achieve low service latency. We first verify the benefits of the new model and present OSN typical properties that lay the basis of our design. We then propose Selective Data replication mechanism in Distributed Datacenters (SD3). In SD3, a datacenter jointly considers update rate and visit rate to select user data for replication, and further atomizes a user's different types of data (e. g., status update, friend post) for replication, making sure that a replica always reduces inter-datacenter communication. The results of trace-driven experiments on the real-world PlanetLab testbed demonstrate the higher efficiency and effectiveness of SD3 in comparison to other replication methods.					21st IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP)21st IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP)	OCT 07-10, 2013OCT 07-10, 2013	IEEE; IEEE Comp Soc; VDE, Informat Technol Soc; Gesell InformatikIEEE; IEEE Comp Soc; VDE, Informat Technol Soc; Gesell Informatik	Gottingen, GERMANYGottingen, GERMANY	0	0	0	0	0	0			1092-1648		978-1-4799-1270-4; 978-1-4799-1270-4	WOS:000333967500012

QC processes need to enable the identification of aberrations, as well as trends that may indicate degradation or component failures. These QC processes form a framework to support the goal of verified data delivered in a timely manner. In this paper, we investigate a method of computing Local Correlation Score (LCS) to detect anomalous patterns among sensor platforms in a concurrent manner. We use the R programming language and OpenMPI. Using empirical tests, we determine the benefits of computing the LCS in parallel, and on various sizes of clusters. We also analyze its use for realtime mapping of Intelligent River data. Our results show that the LCS computed concurrently is an effective means for prompt quality assurance of natural resource data.					4th International Conference on Computing for Geospatial Research and Application (COM.Geo)4th International Conference on Computing for Geospatial Research and Application (COM.Geo)	JUL 22-24, 2013JUL 22-24, 2013	IEEE Comp Soc; Comp Geospatial Res Inst; NASA; OGC; Massachusetts Inst Technol; Stanford Univ; IEEE; Microsoft Res; GISCafe; Sensors & Syst; Microsoft; George Washington Univ; IEEE & CPSIEEE Comp Soc; Comp Geospatial Res Inst; NASA; OGC; Massachusetts Inst Technol; Stanford Univ; IEEE; Microsoft Res; GISCafe; Sensors & Syst; Microsoft; George Washington Univ; IEEE & CPS	San Jose, CASan Jose, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7695-5012-1	WOS:000335232000024

With the plethora of data available it becomes important to extract information from the available data, based on which knowledge of system condition can be formed. This knowledge can then be used in decision making. Metrics such as transient stability margin (TSM) and voltage stability load index (VSLI) help in assessing the stability of the system. In this study, cellular neural network (CNN) based stability margin prediction system is developed in a distributed computing framework. The developed system not only extracts information from available data but also predicts the same, one step ahead of time. Moreover, the framework employed uses distributed computing and hence could be used on a large scale power system with a linear increase in computation time instead of an exponential increase. A reduced version of New Zealand's South Island power system is used as the test. system to demonstrate the feasibility of CNNs for TSM and VSLI prediction.

Despite these strengths, PBIL still suffers from issues of loss of diversity in the population. The use of multi-population is seen as one way of increasing the diversity in the population.

This approach causes the problem of systematic errors because of the nonlinear relationship between power and wind speed. In this paper, recurrent neural networks are introduced as an alternative approach to model this nonlinear relationship. Based on actual wind speed input and wind power output, an input-output relationship is established for a permanent magnet synchronous machine based wind power generator. Experimental studies are carried out to the develop power curve that characterize dynamic power performance of the wind turbine generator.

As the complexity of the electric power grid and associated control increases in the future, modeling and simulation of the power network as well as the control becomes essential. This requirement will be even more prominent in the context of smart grid. As enabling technology, intelligent methods of monitoring and control that utilize computational intelligence techniques are expected to be an integral part of smart grids. Therefore integration of computational intelligence based tools in power system simulation tools is an important aspect of smart grid research. Most past and current applications of neural networks in power systems are carried out offline in non-real-time platforms. In this study, neural networks libraries are developed to run on RTDS. The neural networks component is then used to predict the speed deviation of a generator in a multi-machine power system. These neural networks components can be trained in real-time and hence can be useful tool for smart grid applications.

IEEE					System-of-Systems Platform Scoping								2013 4TH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON PRODUCT LINE APPROACHES IN SOFTWARE ENGINEERING (PLEASE)								1	4					2013	2013	In a system of systems, interoperability among constituent systems is a primary architecture concern. One architecture strategy to promote interoperability in this design context is to create a system-of-systems platform to provide certain common services to all constituent systems, with the goal of reducing development effort for the constituent systems and reducing integration and assurance cost for the system of systems. A successful system-of-systems platform must balance sufficient commonality to support economical reuse, while also providing variability and extensibility to enable innovation in system and system of systems capabilities. These commonality/variability tradeoffs for system-of-systems platforms are frequently tacit decisions, since there are no existing techniques for analyzing such decisions at the scale and degree of requirements uncertainty that characterize most systems of systems.					4th International Workshop on Product LinE Approaches in Software Engineering (PLEASE)4th International Workshop on Product LinE Approaches in Software Engineering (PLEASE)	MAY 20, 2013MAY 20, 2013		San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4673-6449-2	WOS:000333448300001

Changes to roadway infrastructure have reduced the severity of automotive crashes; however, it is driver performance which remains a primary contributing factor to these incidents. An on-board vehicle control system, using combined steering and differential braking, provides enhanced safety by removing driver error from the recovery process once the ROR event has been identified. In this study, two control algorithms, based on sliding mode and state flow theories, have been designed to automatically recover a vehicle from this dangerous scenario. A driver model was also developed based on experimental data gathered at a tire manufacturer's test track. The controllers were numerically evaluated for a common road departure and return situation with comparison to the empirical driver model. The results show that both controllers safely recovered the vehicle and outperformed the driver steering model. Specifically, the state flow controller reduced recovery time by 40% compared to the sliding mode controller, while the driver model resulted in vehicle spin out.

The approach addresses the well-known limitations of today's vehicle-initiated as well as base station-assisted handoff solutions; the former is reactive, therefore slow and inefficient, while the latter is mostly limited to within networks of a single technology. The handoff-as-a-service (HaaS) architecture leverages a cloud system's abundant computing and data storage resources to establish a database of key network properties and configuration options. By abstracting different networks' characteristics into a common set of descriptors, the database can aggregate and share properties of networks of different technologies. Leveraging network awareness of a wider scope, the HaaS service can further analyze optimal network configurations considering global efficiency and individual client requirements. The HaaS service in the computing cloud computes optimal handoff strategies on behalf of the vehicles, and OpenFlow is used to control both the vehicle and infrastructure side network interfaces seamlessly across multiple interfaces of different wireless technologies. This paper presents the proposed system architecture, its key components, and how they can be experimentally studied over National Science Foundation's Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI) testbed. Experiment results on PC Engine device show the feasibility and advantage of the proposed handoff solution.					2nd GENI Research and Educational Experiment Workshop (GREE)2nd GENI Research and Educational Experiment Workshop (GREE)	MAR 20-22, 2013MAR 20-22, 2013	GENI; GPO; NSFGENI; GPO; NSF	Salt Lake City, UTSalt Lake City, UT	2	0	0	0	0	2					978-0-7695-5003-9	WOS:000333520300008

The proposed approach addresses two major challenges for high throughput data transport from Internet to moving vehicles over infrastructure wireless networks such as today's 4G technologies: 1) difficulty in maintaining stable throughput over high latency wide area paths in core networks; 2) difficulty in maintaining continuous data download across road-side units (RSUs) in the edge. Specifically, the system multicasts network-encoded packets in the core network (wired Internet infrastructure) to multiple selected RSUs, while the RSUs collaborate in disseminating and scheduling delivery of the encoded packets to vehicles. Realizing the overall system requires network coding and multipath forwarding capabilities in the core network, and network decoding support in the vehicles. For network coding to be efficient, however, dynamic control of the forwarding paths of the network coded packets are essential. This paper presents the proposed system architecture, its key components, and how they can be experimentally studied over National Science Foundation's Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI) testbed. Experiments on ProtoGENI testbed show the feasibility and advantages of network coding in core networks.					2nd GENI Research and Educational Experiment Workshop (GREE)2nd GENI Research and Educational Experiment Workshop (GREE)	MAR 20-22, 2013MAR 20-22, 2013	GENI; GPO; NSFGENI; GPO; NSF	Salt Lake City, UTSalt Lake City, UT	2	0	0	0	0	2					978-0-7695-5003-9	WOS:000333520300010

We evaluated whether a traditional interaction metaphor of mouse and keyboard for both virtual and GUI sub-systems of our simulation was superior in terms of user preference and performance to a hybrid interaction metaphor of using touchscreen for the virtual environment while using mouse and keyboard for the GUI. We investigated the hybrid interaction metaphor due to its potential to provide a natural touch-based engagement for our trainees with the virtual patient and the 3D environment, while maintaining a familiar interaction metaphor of a keyboard and mouse for user input in the electronic health record view of the simulation. User preference and performance both indicate that the traditional interaction metaphor was more usable than the hybrid interaction metaphor, although each interaction technique was sufficiently usable for accomplishing simulation goals.					1st IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI)1st IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI)	SEP 09-11, 2013SEP 09-11, 2013	IEEE; IEEE Comp SocIEEE; IEEE Comp Soc	Philadelphia, PAPhiladelphia, PA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7695-5089-3	WOS:000332894400011

Unfortunately, this is far from simulating real world experiences that they will soon face, and does not provide the immediate, impartial feedback necessary for interviewing skills development. We developed a system for Scaffolded Interviews Developed by Nurses In Education (SIDNIE) that supports baccalaureate nursing education by providing multiple guided interview practice sessions with virtual characters. During the development and evaluation of SIDNIE we realized the importance of determining the visual and interaction fidelity requirements necessary for proper learning. In this paper we report on two fidelity studies conducted with nursing students. The goal of the visual fidelity study was to determine if our virtual characters containing lifelike animations would have an effect on learning or if we would get the same effect using a stationary image of our virtual environment. The second study focused on the interaction fidelity of our system and the goal was to determine if the interaction modality had an effect on the learning outcome. In particular we evaluated the effect of voice input as compared to a standard mouse-click input for question selection.					1st IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI)1st IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI)	SEP 09-11, 2013SEP 09-11, 2013	IEEE; IEEE Comp SocIEEE; IEEE Comp Soc	Philadelphia, PAPhiladelphia, PA	4	0	0	0	0	4					978-0-7695-5089-3	WOS:000332894400026

A PV system's output power fluctuates according to the weather conditions (irradiance and temperature), season, and geographic location. The power fluctuations of the PV plants raise frequency and voltage stability issues. This paper presents the impact of a large PV plant on the frequency stability of a power system under small and large disturbances. With automatic generation control and phasor measurement unit information, the power generations of conventional generators are adjusted to mitigate the frequency deviation. Furthermore, the effects of increased PV penetration in a given power system area are examined.					45th North American Power Symposium (NAPS)45th North American Power Symposium (NAPS)	SEP 22-24, 2013SEP 22-24, 2013	IEEE; Omaha Publ Power Dist; IEEE Power & Energy Soc; NSF; Schweitzer Engn Labs; Westar Energy; KCP&L; Burns & McDonnell; SegaIEEE; Omaha Publ Power Dist; IEEE Power & Energy Soc; NSF; Schweitzer Engn Labs; Westar Energy; KCP&L; Burns & McDonnell; Sega	Kansas State Univ, Manhattan, KSKansas State Univ, Manhattan, KS	0	0	0	0	0	0			2163-4939		978-1-4799-1255-1	WOS:000332902200105

In current algorithms, packets are forwarded gradually through nodes with higher probability of visiting the destination node or area. However, the number of such nodes usually is limited, leading to insufficient throughput performance. To solve this problem, we propose an inter-landmark data routing algorithm, namely DTN-FLOW. It selects popular places that nodes visit frequently as landmarks and divides the entire DTN area into sub-areas represented by landmarks. Nodes transiting between landmarks relay packets among landmarks, even though they rarely visit the destinations of these packets. Specifically, the number of node transits between two landmarks is measured to represent the forwarding capacity between them, based on which routing tables are built on each landmark to guide packet routing. Each node predicts its transits based on its previous landmark visiting records using the order-k Markov predictor. In a packet routing, a landmark determines the next hop landmark based on its routing table, and forwards the packet to the node with the highest probability of transiting to the selected landmark. Thus, DTN-FLOW fully utilizes all node movements to route packets along landmark paths to their destinations. We analyzed two real DTN traces to support the design of DTN-FLOW. We also deployed a small DTN-FLOW system in our campus for performance evaluation. This deployment and trace-driven simulation demonstrate the high efficiency of DTN-FLOW in comparison with state-of-the-art DTN routing algorithms.

Smart grid will have high uncertainty and variability owing to high penetration of intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar. At the same time, higher efficiencies and reliability is demanded and the electrical power network is being pushed closer to its operating limits. New equipments and technologies are being developed in order to cope with these requirements. It is necessary to have real-time simulation of power system phenomena, components, and intelligent methods of monitoring, communication and control under these changed scenarios in order to ensure stability, reliability, integrity and security of the electric power grid. The RTDS (R), along with its graphical interface RSCAD, provides the ability to design and simulate power systems and controls, and perform hardware-in-the-loop studies. In this paper, neural networks (NN) library developed for RSCAD is applied to intelligent power system applications. The results show that the NN library developed in RSCAD can be an important tool in the study and development of intelligent methods for smart grid applications.

IEEE					Coordinated Design of Local and Wide-area Damping Controllers for Power Systems Using Particle Swarm Optimization								2013 IEEE POWER AND ENERGY SOCIETY GENERAL MEETING (PES)		IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting PESGM												2013	2013	This paper describes an approach to coordinate the design of local and wide-area controllers for damping electromechanical oscillations in power systems. Some of the limitations of local controllers are first illustrated by simulations on a system exhibiting nearly decentralized fixed modes. These are modes that cannot be appreciably shifted using permissible local controls. Wide-area controllers with measurements from distant locations across the system are then added to improve the damping of these modes. The design procedure consists of finding the optimal parameters for local and wide-area controllers that minimize an eigenvalue-based objective function. All controllers are optimized simultaneously to improve coordination. The linear power system model used for control design is obtained by system identification. The optimization problem is solved using particle swarm optimization, which has been shown to be effective for designing local PSSs in the past. Numerical results for a 16-machine/68-bus benchmark power system model demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.

Given an object, a continuum manipulator tries to grasp it by wrapping tightly around it. Autonomous grasping requires real-time determination of whether an object can be grasped after it is identified, and if so, the feasible whole-arm wrapping around configurations of the robot to grasp it, which we call grasping configurations, as well as the path leading to a grasping configuration. In this paper, we describe the process for autonomous grasping from object detection to executing the grasping motion and achieving force-closure grasps, with a focus on a general analysis of all possible types of planar grasping configurations of a three-section continuum manipulator. We further provide conditions for existence of solutions and describe how to find a valid grasping configuration and the associated path automatically if one exists. Experimental results with the OctArm manipulator validate our approach, and shows that the entire process to determine an autonomous grasping operation, which includes automatic detection of the target object and determination of a grasping configuration and a path to the grasping configuration that avoids obstacles, can take just a small fraction of a second. Once a grasping configuration is reached, the manipulator can lift the object stably, i.e., a force-closure grasp can be achieved.

At the completion of the project it was realized that to address the complexity of a Smart Grid with vast numbers of intelligent connected devices and systems, computational intelligence techniques must move from top-down to the lowest levels of architectures, with interactive cooperation between smart components, each with a level of autonomy. The CS-SGVP team emphasized creative thought leadership and "blue sky" thinking to identify future Smart Grid operational visions and the role of computing to achieve these visions. The CS-SGVP team developed its visions using a three-tiered approach. Architectural concepts describe Smart Grid goals and characteristics, general grid types, as well as computing concepts considered common across grid types. Functional concepts describe how the grid will operate. Technological concepts describe the roles of certain technologies within the Smart Grid. The CS-SGVP expects that over the course of many years, various visions will come to fruition.

Database : the journal of biological databases and curation				2013				bat075	bat075		10.1093/database/bat075			2013 Oct 25	2013	Tripal is an open-source freely available toolkit for construction of online genomic and genetic databases. It aims to facilitate development of community-driven biological websites by integrating the GMOD Chado database schema with Drupal, a popular website creation and content management software. Tripal provides a suite of tools for interaction with a Chado database and display of content therein. The tools are designed to be generic to support the various ways in which data may be stored in Chado. Previous releases of Tripal have supported organisms, genomic libraries, biological stocks, stock collections and genomic features, their alignments and annotations. Also, Tripal and its extension modules provided loaders for commonly used file formats such as FASTA, GFF, OBO, GAF, BLAST XML, KEGG heir files and InterProScan XML. Default generic templates were provided for common views of biological data, which could be customized using an open Application Programming Interface to change the way data are displayed. Here, we report additional tools and functionality that are part of release v1.1 of Tripal. These include (i) a new bulk loader that allows a site curator to import data stored in a custom tab delimited format; (ii) full support of every Chado table for Drupal Views (a powerful tool allowing site developers to construct novel displays and search pages); (iii) new modules including 'Feature Map', 'Genetic', 'Publication', 'Project', 'Contact' and the 'Natural Diversity' modules.

The adoption of a new standard of care or healthcare technology needs to be evaluated based on patient outcomes. This review focuses on this problem and possible solutions. This retrospective study reviews clinical characteristics of cardiac resuscitative events associated with "code blue" team response. Team-based investigations are led by a faculty mentor and typically span 2 to 4 semesters. Students take ownership of their projects and take the risks necessary to solve problems and get answers. This review indicates areas of concern that need to be improved to create better patient outcomes. Findings include that improved documentation will provide data elements for review analysis that then may be utilized to improve care related to cardiac arrest.									2	0	0	0	1	3				1538-8646		MEDLINE:23222232	23222232

International journal of breast cancer				2013				369609	369609		10.1155/2013/369609			2013	2013	Research efforts investigating the potential of natural compounds in the fight against cancer are growing. Tannic acid (TA) belongs to the class of hydrolysable tannins and is found in numerous plants and foods. TA is a potent collagen cross-linking agent; the purpose of this study was to generate TA-cross-linked beads and assess the effects on breast cancer cell growth. Collagen beads were stable at body temperature following crosslinking. Exposure to collagen beads with higher levels of TA inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in normal and cancer cells. TA-induced apoptosis involved activation of caspase 3/7 and caspase 9 but not caspase 8. Breast cancer cells expressing the estrogen receptor were more susceptible to the effects of TA. Taken together the results suggest that TA has the potential to become an anti-ER(+) breast cancer treatment or preventative agent.									0	1	0	0	0	1			2090-3170			MEDLINE:24369505	24369505

Comparison of the axial stiffness of carbon composite and aluminium alloy circular external skeletal fixator rings								VETERINARY AND COMPARATIVE ORTHOPAEDICS AND TRAUMATOLOGY				26	3			172	176		10.3415/VCOT-12-03-0047			2013	2013	Objectives: The purpose of this study was to compare the axial stiffness of aluminium alloy and carbon composite single-ring constructs.Methods: Single-ring constructs were made with rings of different material compositions (aluminium alloy and carbon composite), diameters (55 mm, 85 mm, and 115 mm), and thicknesses (6 mm for the single-ring, 12 mm for the double-ring) with all other components remaining constant. Stiffness of each construct was determined under loading in axial compression with a materials testing machine. The axial stiffness of each group was compared using a three-factor factorial analysis of variance investigating all main effects and interactions between ring diameter, ring thickness, and ring material composition; p<0.05 was considered significant.Results: Carbon composite constructs were 16-55% as stiff as corresponding aluminium alloy constructs. Within each combination of ring material composition and ring diameter, stiffness did not significantly increase when the ring thickness was doubled. Within each combination of ring material composition and ring thickness, stiffness significantly decreased with increased ring diameter.Clinical significance: Aluminium alloy rings were found to be significantly stiffer than carbon composite rings. Although the carbon composite rings were considerably less stiff, clinical recommendations cannot be made from a single-ring in vitro analysis. Further studies are needed to evaluate the behaviour of these rings in vivo.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0932-0814			WOS:000319711500003	23677120

Meat, chicken offal, and feather samples collected from local supermarkets and rendering processing plants were used to isolate SPB (n = 142). Bacteriophages (n = 52) specific to SPB were isolated and purified from the above samples using 18 of those isolated SPB strains as hosts. The host ranges of bacteriophages against 5 selected SPB strains (Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, and Hafnia alvei) were determined. Electron microscopy observation of 9 phages selected for the phage cocktail revealed that 6 phages belonged to the family of Siphoviridae and 3 belonged to the Myoviridae family. Restriction enzyme digestion analysis with endonuclease DraI detected 6 distinguished patterns among the 9 phages. Phage treatment prevented the growth of SPB for up to 10 h with multiplicity of infection ratios of 1, 10, 100, and 1000 in tryptic soy broth at 30 degrees C, and extended the lag phase of SPB growth for 2 h at 22 degrees C with multiplicities of infection of 10, 100, and 1000. These results suggest that the selected bacteriophage cocktail has a high potential for phage application to control SPB in raw animal materials destined for the rendering process.									7	0	0	6	0	8			0008-4166	1480-3275		WOS:000314832100007	23391228	
J	Luo, Peng; Sharp, Julia L.; DeVol, Timothy A.								BAYESIAN ANALYSES OF TIME-INTERVAL DATA FOR ENVIRONMENTAL RADIATION MONITORING								HEALTH PHYSICS				104	1			15	25		10.1097/HP.0b013e318260d5f8			JAN 2013	2013	Time-interval (time difference between two consecutive pulses) analysis based on the principles of Bayesian inference was investigated for online radiation monitoring. Using experimental and simulated data, Bayesian analysis of time-interval data [Bayesian (ti)] was compared with Bayesian and a conventional frequentist analysis of counts in a fixed count time [Bayesian (cnt) and single interval test (SIT), respectively]. The performances of the three methods were compared in terms of average run length (ARL) and detection probability for several simulated detection scenarios. Experimental data were acquired with a DGF-4C system in list mode. Simulated data were obtained using Monte Carlo techniques to obtain a random sampling of the Poisson distribution. All statistical algorithms were developed using the R Project for statistical computing. Bayesian analysis of time-interval information provided a similar detection probability as Bayesian analysis of count information, but the authors were able to make a decision with fewer pulses at relatively higher radiation levels. In addition, for the cases with very short presence of the source (< count time), time-interval information is more sensitive to detect a change than count information since the source data is averaged by the background data over the entire count time. The relationships of the source time, change points, and modifications to the Bayesian approach for increasing detection probability are presented.

Similarly, medically diagnosed cases from a Tennessee-based managed care organization (MCO) claims data warehouse were extracted for the same time period. MCO and Tennessee Department of Health incidence rates were compared using a complete randomized block design within a general linear mixed model to measure potential supplemental reporting opportunity.Results MCO LD incidence was 7.7 times higher (p<0.001) than that reported to the state, possibly indicating significant under-reporting (similar to 196 unreported cases per year). MCO data also suggest about 33 cases of RMSF go unreported each year in Tennessee (p<0.001). Three cases of babesiosis were discovered using claims data, a significant finding as this disease was only recently confirmed in Tennessee.Discussion Data sharing between MCOs and health departments for vaccine information already exists (eg, the Vaccine Safety Datalink Rapid Cycle Analysis project). There may be a significant opportunity in Tennessee to supplement the current passive infectious disease reporting system with administrative claims data, particularly for LD and RMSF.Conclusions There are limitations with administrative claims data, but health plans may help bridge data gaps and support the federal administration's vision of combining public and private data into one source.									8	0	0	3	0	8			1067-5027			WOS:000313512900031	22811492

Studies in health technology and informatics				184				273	5					2013	2013	Laparoscopic surgery demands perceptual-motor skills that are fundamentally different from open surgery, and laparoscopists must be adept at perceiving tissue interaction at the surgical site and then applying precise amounts of forces through instruments without damaging tissues. A haptic simulator that emulates multiple salient laparoscopic tasks and renders differing degrees of forces was created. Two of the haptic skills tasks were evaluated in two studies to determine their ability to distinguish and then train laparoscopic force application sensitivity. Results suggested that the simulator has the capability of rendering salient force feedback information to which novices become increasingly more perceptually sensitive.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0926-9630			MEDLINE:23400169	23400169

Todd								Simvastatin Suppresses Cyclophosphamide-induced Changes in Urodynamics and Bladder Inflammation								UROLOGY				81	1					209.e9	10.1016/j.urology.2012.08.041			JAN 2013	2013	OBJECTIVE To assess the ability of daily oral simvastatin administration to reduce the negative urodynamic changes associated with cyclophosphamide (CP)-induced cystitis and to prevent bladder inflammation. Patients undergoing CP chemotherapy frequently develop cystitis, leading to urinary dysfunction and hemorrhage. Recent studies have suggested statins possess anti-inflammatory properties and might be uroprotective.MATERIALS AND METHODS Urodynamic properties were analyzed in 4 groups of female Sprague-Dawley rats: group 1, vehicle (300 mu L, 0.5% methylcellulose, orally for 7 days); group 2, simvastatin (1 mg/rat/d); group 3, vehicle plus CP (intraperitoneally 80 mg/kg, 24 h before cystometry); and group 4, simvastatin plus CP. The inflammation in the groups was assessed using Evans blue extravasation.RESULTS CP stimulated significant increases in the number of nonvoiding contractions (0.83 +/- 0.26 vs 4.97 +/- 1.90; P = .03) and decreases in the peak voiding pressure (53.46 +/- 5.08 vs 33.34 +/- 4.37 cm H2O; P = .01). Simvastatin returned these parameters to the control levels of 1.62 +/- 0.73 (P = .70) and 45.98 +/- 7.78 cm H2O (P = .38). CP at this level caused a slight, but significant, increase in the voided volume (0.82 +/- 0.13 vs 1.16 +/- 0.14 mL; P = .04), which returned to control levels (0.74 +/- 0.12 mL; P = .65) with simvastatin. Other urodynamic parameters, such as the threshold pressure, were not affected by simvastatin or CP, or the combination of the 2. CP-induced inflammation in the bladder (Evans blue extravasation) was suppressed by simvastatin.CONCLUSION Simvastatin was effective at ameliorating the negative urodynamic changes and inflammation in the bladder after CP administration and is a potential therapy for preventing side effects in patients undergoing this chemotherapy.

The fiber can be manipulated by varying the coil current in an electromagnet. The operating range of the fiber is divided into one region with stable equilibria and one region with unstable equilibria. In this paper, fiber dynamics are modeled as a rigid bar. This model is used to develop a nonlinear controller for the position of the fiber over the whole operating range. An experimental platform for sensing and controlling fiber position was developed. The controller is tested experimentally and results are presented. The results show that the controller can control the position of the fiber in the unstable region despite model uncertainty.					52nd IEEE Annual Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)52nd IEEE Annual Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	DEC 10-13, 2013DEC 10-13, 2013	Honeywell; MathWorks; Springer; Taylor & Francis; Univ Trieste; Elsevier; GE Global Res; Natl Instruments; PendCon; Soc Ind & Appl Math; Wolfram; Journal Franklin Inst; United Technologies Res Ctr; Danieli AutomatHoneywell; MathWorks; Springer; Taylor & Francis; Univ Trieste; Elsevier; GE Global Res; Natl Instruments; PendCon; Soc Ind & Appl Math; Wolfram; Journal Franklin Inst; United Technologies Res Ctr; Danieli Automat	Florence, ITALYFlorence, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0743-1546		978-1-4673-5717-3	WOS:000352223504005

With current investigations of sulfur-rich metalloenzyme active sites as well as the antioxidant activity of ergothioneine, selenoneine, and thione-containing anti-thyroid drugs, the coordination chemistry of thione and selone ligands with biologically common first-row transition metals has sparked considerable recent interest. This review focuses on the biological functions of thione- and selone-containing compounds, their coordination chemistry with iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, and zinc, and the biological implications of this chalcogenone-metal binding. While thione-metal coordination has been widely studied, only a few selone-metal complexes with first-row transition metals have been reported.					244th National Fall Meeting of the American-Chemical-Society (ACS)244th National Fall Meeting of the American-Chemical-Society (ACS)	AUG 19-23, 2012AUG 19-23, 2012	Amer Chem Soc, Div Hist Chem; Amer Chem Soc; Amer Chem Soc, Div Chem Educ; Amer Chem Soc, Div Inorgan Chem; Soc Biol Inorgan Chem; Amer Chem Soc, Div Polymer Chem IncAmer Chem Soc, Div Hist Chem; Amer Chem Soc; Amer Chem Soc, Div Chem Educ; Amer Chem Soc, Div Inorgan Chem; Soc Biol Inorgan Chem; Amer Chem Soc, Div Polymer Chem Inc	Philadelphia, PAPhiladelphia, PA	7	0	0	3	0	7			0097-6156		978-0-8412-2903-7	WOS:000331589700004

IEEE					Exploring Software Supply Chains From a Technical Debt Perspective								2013 4TH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON MANAGING TECHNICAL DEBT (MTD)								32	38					2013	2013	Software development has evolved from software development organizations building custom solutions for every need and creating a backlog of applications needed by users to specialized organizations producing components that are supplied to other software development organizations to speed the development of their software products. Our objective is to illustrate how a manager might use supply chain information to evaluate software being considered for inclusion in a product. We investigated the Eclipse platform code to illustrate analysis methods that produce information of use to decision makers. The technical debt of the software pieces was measured using the Technical Debt plug-in to Sonar as one input into the evaluation of supply chain quality. The dependency graphs of "uses" relationships among files were analyzed using graph metrics such as betweenness centrality. There was a statistically significant moderate correlation between the technical debt for a file and the betweenness centrality for that file. This relationship is used as the basis for a heuristic approach to forming advice to a development manager regarding which assets to acquire.					4th International Workshop on Managing Technical Debt (MTD)4th International Workshop on Managing Technical Debt (MTD)	MAY 20, 2013MAY 20, 2013		San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4673-6443-0	WOS:000331830500006

IEEE					VSPIN: A Framework for Developing Incremental Sensor Network Reprogramming Strategies								2013 4TH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING FOR SENSOR NETWORK APPLICATIONS (SESENA)		International Workshop on Software Engineering and Sensor Network Applications						30	34					2013	2013	We present VSPIN, a framework for developing incremental code update mechanisms to support efficient reprogramming of wireless sensor networks. The presentation emphasizes the supporting framework rather than the reprogramming mechanisms themselves. Concretely, VSPIN provides a modular testing platform on a host desktop system to plug-in and evaluate various incremental code update algorithms. The framework supports Avrdude, among the most popular programming tools for AVR microcontrollers.VSPIN consists of a virtual serial port device driver which executes in Linux kernel space, a user space component, and a corresponding boot loader which executes on the sensing (microcontroller) core. The framework is tailored for AVR microcontrollers, which support in-system reprogramming of on-chip flash memory through a serial interface (SPI or UART). On the host side, VSPIN can function with wireless communication devices (802.11b/g/n or 802.15.4), or wired communication devices which expose a serial device interface on the Linux platform (RS-232 or USB). We describe the overall architecture and detail the individual components of VSPIN. The development of VSPIN is the first such attempt to facilitate ease of development, testing, and use of incremental code update algorithms for efficient network reprogramming.					4th International Workshop on Software Engineering for Sensor Network Applications (SESENA)4th International Workshop on Software Engineering for Sensor Network Applications (SESENA)	MAY 21, 2013MAY 21, 2013		San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0			2327-1620		978-1-4673-6269-6	WOS:000331477400006

Understanding participant decision criteria could increase targeting of specific student populations, improve program outcomes, and increase efficiency of site directors. This ongoing study builds off previous work by the NSF [1] on REU programs to answer the following questions: (1) are participant selection criteria uniform for all STEM REU programs or do they vary by program primary discipline, (2) do additional factors not previously considered, such as geography and other offers they receive, significantly impact REU selection, and (3) do factors significantly vary by each successive student cohort. To collect data, a survey was sent to REU participants through nine participating National Science Foundation (NSF) site administrators. Geographic distributions of applications were classified based on distance and spread with respect to hometown and indicated applicant divisions. Initial results showed that twenty five percent of these participants were offered multiple positions and seven percent of respondents declined another offer before accepting their current position.					43rd Annual Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)43rd Annual Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)	OCT 23-26, 2013OCT 23-26, 2013	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers Comp Soc; Amer Soc Engn Educ, Educ Res Methods Div; Inst Elect & Elect Engineers; Inst Elect & Elect Engineers Educ SocInst Elect & Elect Engineers Comp Soc; Amer Soc Engn Educ, Educ Res Methods Div; Inst Elect & Elect Engineers; Inst Elect & Elect Engineers Educ Soc	Univ Oklahoma, Coll Engn, Oklahoma City, OKUniv Oklahoma, Coll Engn, Oklahoma City, OK	0	0	0	0	0	0			0190-5848		978-1-4673-5261-1	WOS:000330839100263

In our framework, identity is composed of students' perceptions of their performance/competence, recognition, and interest in a domain. This paper outlines the creation of a model of engineering choice based on this framework. The data utilized in this analysis come from the nationally-representative Sustainability and Gender in Engineering (SaGE) survey. Distributed during the fall of 2011, the survey was completed by 6,772 college students across the United States enrolled in first-year English courses. A structural equation model was built using previously validated constructs of mathematics, physics, and general science identities. These three constructs predict an engineering identity which, in turn, influences the choice of engineering in college. The model is a step towards a better understanding of the choice of an engineering major in college.					43rd Annual Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)43rd Annual Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)	OCT 23-26, 2013OCT 23-26, 2013	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers Comp Soc; Amer Soc Engn Educ, Educ Res Methods Div; Inst Elect & Elect Engineers; Inst Elect & Elect Engineers Educ SocInst Elect & Elect Engineers Comp Soc; Amer Soc Engn Educ, Educ Res Methods Div; Inst Elect & Elect Engineers; Inst Elect & Elect Engineers Educ Soc	Univ Oklahoma, Coll Engn, Oklahoma City, OKUniv Oklahoma, Coll Engn, Oklahoma City, OK	0	0	0	0	0	0			0190-5848		978-1-4673-5261-1	WOS:000330839100018		
S	Kirn, Adam; Benson, Lisa			IEEE					Quantitative Assessment of Student Motivation to Characterize Differences Between Engineering Majors								2013 IEEE FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE		Frontiers in Education Conference												2013	2013	Student motivation is often undervalued in comparison to academic performance measures for evaluating changes in higher education. There is a need to consider the affective domain in reform, in addition to academic performance. The effect of student motivation toward short-and long-term goals on student actions is not well understood. To assess this need, two research questions are addressed: 1) What elements of a motivation instrument designed for first-year engineering students are valid for upper-level engineering students? 2) How do motivations differ for upper level students in different engineering majors? Students in their major-specific engineering courses were surveyed with the Motivation and Attitudes in Engineering (MAE) instrument, which assesses long-term goal related expectancy, and perceptions of present and future tasks/goals. Short-term task self-efficacy was assessed using items adapted from the Attitudes and Approaches to Problem Solving survey. Results based on comparisons between major, class, and grade point average (GPA) showed: 1) Higher GPA indicates significantly higher expectancies and self-efficacy; 2) Bioengineers have significantly higher expectancies than mechanical engineers; and 3) Juniors have significantly higher GPAs, expectancies, and more positive perceptions of the present than sophomores. Results indicate that students' motivations toward short-and long-term goals may influence actions toward learning.					43rd Annual Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)43rd Annual Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)	OCT 23-26, 2013OCT 23-26, 2013	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers Comp Soc; Amer Soc Engn Educ, Educ Res Methods Div; Inst Elect & Elect Engineers; Inst Elect & Elect Engineers Educ SocInst Elect & Elect Engineers Comp Soc; Amer Soc Engn Educ, Educ Res Methods Div; Inst Elect & Elect Engineers; Inst Elect & Elect Engineers Educ Soc	Univ Oklahoma, Coll Engn, Oklahoma City, OKUniv Oklahoma, Coll Engn, Oklahoma City, OK	0	0	0	0	0	0			0190-5848		978-1-4673-5261-1	WOS:000330839100021

Some types of applications, such as rare event sampling, additionally require guaranteed completion of all subtasks for analysis, and place significant demands on the workflow management and execution environment. SciFlow is a user interface built over the Hadoop infrastructure that provides a framework to support the complex process and data interactions and guaranteed completion requirements of scientific workflows. It provides an efficient mechanism for building a parallel scientific application with dataflow patterns, and enables the design, deployment, and execution of data intensive, many-task computing tasks on a Hadoop platform. The design principles of this framework emphasize simplicity, scalability and fault-tolerance. A case study using the forward flux sampling rare event simulation application validates the functionality, reliability and effectiveness of the framework.

S	Corzine, Keith			IEEE					Dc Micro Grid Protection with the Z-Source Breaker								39TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS SOCIETY (IECON 2013)		IEEE Industrial Electronics Society						2197	2204					2013	2013	Many components of a modern micro grid operate using a dc interface including solar panels, fuel cells, and battery energy storage. For this reason, a dc micro grid has been suggested and utilized in some power systems. With the absence of a zero-crossing in the current waveform, the dc breaker faces a unique challenge in that there is no natural method of extinguishing an arc that occurs during breaker operation. This is handled in practice by using over-sized ac breakers, using a solid-state breaker, or using a hybrid solid-state/mechanical breaker. A recently introduced z-source breaker is a unique form of the solid-state breaker that automatically reacts in real-time to system faults; not requiring the typical fault sensing and detection. It has the ability to clear the fault within microseconds. Furthermore, the source will not experience the fault current. In this paper, the theory behind the z-source breaker is reviewed and the breaker is studied in the context of several micro grid topological arrangements using non-real-time and real-time simulation.					39th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial-Electronics-Society (IECON)39th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial-Electronics-Society (IECON)	NOV 10-14, 2013NOV 10-14, 2013	IEEE Ind Elect Soc; Inst Elect & Elect Engineers; Austrian Inst Technol; Vienna Univ TechnolIEEE Ind Elect Soc; Inst Elect & Elect Engineers; Austrian Inst Technol; Vienna Univ Technol	Vienna, AUSTRIAVienna, AUSTRIA	3	0	0	0	0	3			1553-572X		978-1-4799-0224-8	WOS:000331149502027		
J	Xie, Zhen; Zeng, Hai-Shen; Liu, Chen; Chen, Yong; Zhong, Ming-Yu								Simultaneous Quantification of Protocatechuic Acid, Caffeic Acid, Quercetin and Kaempferol in Urena lobata L. by HPLC-VWD								LATIN AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACY				32	2			251	256					2013	2013	A simple, rapid and specific HPLC method was developed with variable wavelength UV detection (VWD) for simultaneously quantification of four analytes in Urena lobata L., namely protocatechuic acid, caffeic acid, quercetin and kaempferol, with the help of Doehlert matrix and desirability function approach to optimize the extract procedure conditions for sample preparation. The chromatographic separation was performed on a Thermo Syncronis - C-18 (250 x 4.6mm, 5 mu m) by gradient elution of methanol and 0.5 % acetic acid at 25 degrees C, 258, 320 and 360 nm of VWD which were switched to determine the corresponding analytes. Protocatechuic acid was determined at 258 nm; caffeic acid was determined at 320nm; kaempferol and quercetin were determined at 360 nm. The method was validated through the following performance criteria: linearity, precision, repeatability, stability, recovery, limit of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ). This assay was successfully used for determination of four ingredients in 10 raw herbs collected from different regions in Guangxi province, China. Significant variations were demonstrated in the contents of four ingredients in these samples. This HPLC method provided a feasible and convenient technique for simultaneous determination of four analytes with different maximum UV absorption in one assay by VWD.									0	1	0	0	0	1			0326-2383			WOS:000331247800016

The channels employed by this network are nonoverlapping, and each channel differs significantly in its characteristics, such as achievable data rate, communication range, and traffic load. Each terminal is equipped with a frequency-agile radio that has the ability to change its carrier frequency and transmission rate over a wide range of possibilities. These radios communicate using contention-based access and are permitted to utilize multiple channels. A subset of the terminals form a backbone network, and are equipped with a second radio tuned to a traffic channel employing schedule-based access. We consider various hierarchical and heterogeneous multichannel ad hoc network topologies and investigate the backbone networks that increase network-layer performance over scenarios in which too few or too many terminals are selected to form the backbone network.

J	Xie, Fei; Huang, Yongxi					Xie, Fei/0000-0003-4325-2868			Sustainable Biofuel Supply Chain Planning and Management Under Uncertainty								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD					2385			19	27		10.3141/2385-03			2013	2013	The concept of environmental thinking is integrated into sustainable supply chain planning and management for biofuels, and a multiobjective modeling framework is developed. The aim is to seek best-compromise solutions that are economically and environmentally sustainable in supplying biofuels from cellulosic biomasses while satisfying demand, resource, and technology constraints. The least-cost objective and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions are integrated into the modeling framework, and carbon footprints are assessed with the Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation model, a life-cycle assessment framework, to ensure that strategies to mitigate GHG emissions are factored into system planning and management. Biomass-to-biofuel conversion efficiency can be highly variable because of uncertainties inherent in the conversion processes; this uncertainty is considered explicitly in the integrated modeling framework. A multiobjective, mixed-integer, stochastic programming model is proposed and solved by the compromise method, a subclass of the goal programming method. The model is used to evaluate the economic potential and environmental impact of establishing a cellulosic ethanol supply chain based on biowaste (i.e., corn stover and forest residue) in California as a case study. Significant trade-offs exist between economic competitiveness and environmental quality. The uncertainty inherent in biomass-to-biofuel conversion technology has substantial effects on multicriteria decision making, and the effects may vary with the choice of modeling approaches.									3	0	0	0	1	4			0361-1981	2169-4052		WOS:000331028300004

J	Munanura, Ian E.; Backman, Kenneth F.; Sabuhoro, Edwin								Managing tourism growth in endangered species' habitats of Africa: Volcanoes National Park in Rwanda								CURRENT ISSUES IN TOURISM				16	7-8	SI		700	718		10.1080/13683500.2013.785483			2013	2013	Like other developing African countries, Rwanda has embraced nature-based tourism for its economic potential. However, tourism can cause irreversible harm, especially in fragile but popular tourist destinations such as Volcanoes National Park (VPN) in Rwanda, which is home to endangered species. Instead of focusing greater attention on this risk, park management has embarked on expanding tourism for greater revenue opportunities. Thus, this paper aims to explore tourism growth and potential resulting threats, investigate the capacity of tourism staff to manage the projected growth, and provide recommendations for management to develop tourism while considering its long-term effects. In addition to conducting interviews with senior park management, Appreciative Inquiry was utilised, which involves stages of grounding, discovery, and design to promote stakeholders' discussions on the future of tourism for VPN and GIS ArcView to map tourism use zones. The results highlight three main findings. First, tourism revenue-driven enthusiasm overshadows the park's fragility. Second, the proposed growth does not include an appropriate impact mitigation strategy. Third, human resources' skills for managing the planned tourism growth are limited. Consequently, the planned tourism growth could potentially destroy the park. Several recommendations (e. g. tourism use zoning plan) are made.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1368-3500	1747-7603		WOS:000330409100006

Communities' displacement from national park and tourism development in the Usangu Plains, Tanzania								CURRENT ISSUES IN TOURISM				16	7-8	SI		719	735		10.1080/13683500.2013.785484			2013	2013	Land-use-change conflicts have shaped the conservation and tourism activities and human livelihood debate in the Usangu Plains over the last 10 years. This has led Ruaha National Park to become the largest national park in Tanzania and the second largest in Africa. The need to understand the rationale behind the expansion of Ruaha National Park and the local communities' views on tourism activities has become increasingly important. The purpose of this study was to examine land-use change in the Usangu Plains and its implication to local communities. Community members in five villages, Ikoga Mpya, Igomelo, Nyeregete, Mahango and Luhango, were surveyed using semi-structured interviews, focus groups and field notes. This resulted in a total of 79 semi-structured interviews, 4 focus group discussions and field observation data to analyse the situation in Usangu Plains. Data were analysed using NVIVO computer software for coding and themes' generation. Major themes that emerged from the analysis were land-use change, tourism as a form of land use, tourism benefits and coping mechanisms. The findings from this study suggest that local communities do not perceive that they are benefitting from the change from agricultural to tourism practices. Changing the way local communities perceived themselves and are involved in conservation activities is the key to achieving the best conservation results and community residents' involvement in future tourism activities in their areas.									5	0	0	1	0	5			1368-3500	1747-7603		WOS:000330409100007

To date, no reliable method has been developed for identifying individuals or monitoring their populations. Here we describe a non-invasive genetic monitoring technique for individual identification of sloth bears. After testing 18 micro satellites developed for other carnivore species, including ursids, we optimized a panel of 7 highly polymorphic microsatellite loci that yielded a cumulative Probability of Identity between siblings value of 2.15E-03. We used this panel to identify 55 individual sloth bears from 190 fecal and 4 hair samples collected in tiger reserves in central India. This panel can be used for population genetic studies and population monitoring of sloth bears.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1537-6176			WOS:000330415200007

For this to occur, the modulation must be selected to match the subchannel conditions as they evolve over time, which requires that subchannel state information be collected and routinely updated. In this study we develop and evaluate a method for modulation adaptation that does not rely on traditional channel measurements to assess subchannel quality.

A censorship-resistant web browsing system must be scalable, blocking resistant, and tracing resistant. However, current censorship-resistant web browsing systems, which use a group of dedicated proxies to bypass censorship, fail to meet these requirements. To tackle these challenges, we propose Freeweb, which relies on widely-distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) nodes in a decentralized manner rather than specified proxies in a centralized manner. Freeweb is built on top of a Distributed Hash Table (DHT)-based P2P network, where nodes not under censorship help nodes under censorship to access blocked webpages. Freeweb has a web browser front-end whose user interface resembles existing web browsers. The underlying complex process of retrieving blocked webpages is therefore hidden from users. We implemented and open-sourced Freeweb and conducted extensive real-world experiments on Planet Lab. The experimental results show that Freeweb has a high success rate and reasonable browsing latency.					42nd Annual International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP)42nd Annual International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP)	OCT 01-04, 2013OCT 01-04, 2013	INRIA; LIP Lab; Univ Lyon, MILYON; IEEE Comp SocINRIA; LIP Lab; Univ Lyon, MILYON; IEEE Comp Soc	Ecole Normale Superieure Lyon, Lyon, FRANCEEcole Normale Superieure Lyon, Lyon, FRANCE	1	0	0	0	0	1			0190-3918		978-0-7695-5117-3	WOS:000330046000014

IEEE					Wireless Infrastructure for Remote Environmental Monitoring: Deployment and Evaluation								2013 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SELECTED TOPICS IN MOBILE AND WIRELESS NETWORKING (MOWNET)								68	73					2013	2013	The world is witnessing tremendous innovation in wireless sensing technology, which creates opportunities to benefit environmental monitoring in significant ways. However, there are several challenges that are not thoroughly discussed by current studies in designing the wireless network infrastructure for these applications. In general, the monitoring units should provide reliable data communication across diverse environments. The wireless system should also meet requirements that most current platforms fail to satisfy, such as scalable coverage, reliability, robustness, and low operating cost. Finally, the network architecture should be kept simple to aid in the management of infrastructure deployments across disparate environments. With the aim of addressing these challenges, a two-tier network architecture for remote environmental monitoring is described in this study: (i) A sensor gateway is designed to transmit observation data from local sensors at the first tier. (ii) The second tier of the infrastructure reliably replays this data to a remote server for analysis via a wireless mesh network. A wide range of environments are supported, from open fields and dense forests, to Wi-Fi areas and cellular-only zones. In this study, a wireless backhaul network comprising wireless sensor gateways was deployed in Aiken, South Carolina. The network performance was systematically evaluated through experimental trials. Results demonstrate the infrastructures ability to support effective data collection and reliable data transmission.

Micro-patterning of streptavidin-biotin-ampicillin/heparin on poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) surfaces: simultaneous antimicrobial and anticoagulant activity								BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE				1	7			711	718		10.1039/c3bm00187c			2013	2013	Formation of heterogeneous and controllable surface patterns on polymeric materials containing antimicrobial and anticoagulant components represent an attractive way of maintaining synthetic materials "clean" from adverse bio-activities. The primary surface "contaminants" are microbial films as well as blood coagulation, both affecting not only performance of internal or external devices, but often exhibiting detrimental effects on patients. In an effort to simultaneously inhibit formation of microbial films and surface blood coagulation multifunctional assemblies containing streptavidin (STR)-biotin bioconjugates were developed on poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) surfaces. Using STR conjugated to a biotin-functionalized PTFE surface, spatially controlled micro-patterning was produced by grafting biotinylated polyethylene glycol (B-PEG) to COOH modified PTFE (MA-PTFE), followed by inkjet micro-printing of biotinylated ampicillin (B-AM) and biotinylated heparin (B-HP) molecules. These surfaces exhibit simultaneous antimicrobial and anticoagulant attributes manifested by "zone of inhibition" and anticoagulant measurements. Quantitative spectroscopic analysis revealed that the required surface density of COOH groups on PTFE is 2.94 x 10(-7) g cm(-2), and B-PEG and STR densities of 9.2 x 10(-8) g cm(-2) and 3.5 x 10(-8) g cm(-2), respectively, are sufficient to achieve simultaneous antimicrobial and anticoagulant responses. These studies also showed that the force required to remove STR-biotin conjugates attached to PTFE surfaces measured by atomic force microscopy is approximately 1090 pN, thus providing desirable surface mechanical stability.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2047-4830	2047-4849		WOS:000330136100003

The proposed model canbe used to design confinement reinforcement as an alternative to AASHTO's prescriptive requirements. The model considers a range of I-girder conditions and variations, yet is intended to be practical enough for use by bridge design engineers. Variables in the design model include flange and bearing geometry, strand size and placement, effective prestress force, concrete and steel material properties, and the effects of steel bearing plates. The model is based on strut-and-tie and shear-friction concepts and considers the lateral-splitting failure mode.

Although knowledge of CHD is limited, altered hemodynamic conditions are suspected as the factor that stimulates cardiovascular cell response, resulting in the heart morphology remodeling that ultimately causes CHDs. Therefore, one of recent efforts in CHD study is to develop high-speed imaging tools to correlate the rapidly changing hemodynamic condition and the morphological adaptations of an embryonic heart in vivo. We have developed a high-speed streak mode OCT that works at the center wavelength of 830 nm and is capable of providing images (292x220 mu m(2)) of the outflow tract of an embryonic chick heart at the rate of 1000 Hz. The modality can provide a voxel resolution in the range of 10 mu m(3), and the spectral resolution allows a depth range of 1.63 mm. In the study reported here, each of the 4D images of an outflow tract was recorded for 2 seconds. The recording was conducted every 2 hours (HH17 to HH18), 3 hours (HH14 to HH17), and 4 hours (HH18 to HH19). Because of the fast scan speed, there is no need for postacquisition processing such as use of gating techniques to provide a fine 3D structure. In addition, more details of the outflow tract are preserved in the recorded images. The 4D images can be used in the future to determine the role of blood flow in CHD development.

DIRECTIONAL WEIGHT BASED CONTOURLET TRANSFORM DENOISING ALGORITHM FOR OCT IMAGE								INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION AND SOFT COMPUTING				19	4	SI		525	535		10.1080/10798587.2013.869110			2013	2013	Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging system has been widely used in biomedical field. However, the speckle noise in the OCT image prevents the application of this technology. The validity of existing contourlet-based denoising methods has been demonstrated. In the contourlet transform, the directional information contained by spatial domain is reflected in the corresponding sub-bands, while the noise is evenly distributed to each sub-band, resulting in a big difference among the coefficients' distribution of sub-bands. The traditional algorithms do not take these features into account, and only use uniform threshold shrinkage function to each sub-band, which limits the denoising effect. In this paper, a novel direction statistics approach is proposed to build a directional weight model in the spatial domain based on image gradient information to represent the effective edge information of different sub-bands, and this weight is introduced into threshold function for denoising. The experiments prove the effectiveness of this method. The proposed denoising framework is applied in contourlet soft threshold and bivariate threshold denoising algorithms for a large number of OCT images, and the results of these experiments show that the proposed algorithm effectively reduces noise while preferably preserves edge information.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1079-8587	2326-005X		WOS:000329179800004

Effects of water quality changes on phytoplankton and lesser flamingo Phoeniconaias minor populations at Kamfers Dam, a saline wetland near Kimberley, South Africa								AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE				38	3			287	294		10.2989/16085914.2013.833889			2013	2013	Kamfers Dam, a wetland near Kimberley, South Africa, supports a population of Near Threatened lesser flamingos Phoeniconaias minor. The cyanobacterium Arthrospira fusiformis (Voronikhin) Komarek and Lund 1990, the flamingos' food source, was in bloom in April 2009. The city's wastewater treatment plant discharges partially treated and untreated sewage directly into Kamfers Dam, creating elevated water levels, poor water quality and hypereutrophication. Subsequently, a crash in the A. fusiformis population compromised the lesser flamingos' food source. The water quality and algal community of Kamfers Dam were monitored using historical water quality data plus water quality analyses from 2009 to 2011. Conductivity, pH, sodium, chloride and total dissolved salts showed significant decreases over time. Spearman rank correlation was used to measure relationships among physicochemical parameters and densities of algae. Arthrospira fusiformis was positively correlated with conductivity (Spearman rho = 0.661, p = 0.029), total dissolved salts (Spearman rho = 0.672, p = 0.026) and negatively correlated with total phosphorus (Spearman rho = -0.718, p = 0.003). While significant correlations were found, attempts to develop a model for predicting algal community composition were unsuccessful due to strong multicollinearity among the water chemistry parameters.									2	0	0	3	0	3			1608-5914	1727-9364		WOS:000327995900007

The availability of its genome sequence and methods for identifying genes responsible for important cacao traits will aid cacao researchers and breeders.Results: We describe the sequencing and assembly of the genome of Theobroma cacao L. cultivar Matina 1-6. The genome of the Matina 1-6 cultivar is 445 Mbp, which is significantly larger than a sequenced Criollo cultivar, and more typical of other cultivars. The chromosome-scale assembly, version 1.1, contains 711 scaffolds covering 346.0 Mbp, with a contig N50 of 84.4 kbp, a scaffold N50 of 34.4 Mbp, and an evidence-based gene set of 29,408 loci. Version 1.1 has 10x the scaffold N50 and 4x the contig N50 as Criollo, and includes 111 Mb more anchored sequence. The version 1.1 assembly has 4.4% gap sequence, while Criollo has 10.9%. Through a combination of haplotype, association mapping and gene expression analyses, we leverage this robust reference genome to identify a promising candidate gene responsible for pod color variation. We demonstrate that green/red pod color in cacao is likely regulated by the R2R3 MYB transcription factor TcMYB113, homologs of which determine pigmentation in Rosaceae, Solanaceae, and Brassicaceae. One SNP within the target site for a highly conserved trans-acting siRNA in dicots, found within TcMYB113, seems to affect transcript levels of this gene and therefore pod color variation.Conclusions: We report a high-quality sequence and annotation of Theobroma cacao L. and demonstrate its utility in identifying candidate genes regulating traits.									43	7	0	44	0	50			1465-6906	1474-760X		WOS:000328194200001	23731509

This is done by taking the glass to a temperature above T-g and exerting force using an upper and lower mold. These molds will, together, give the pressed lens its shape. This study focuses on the high temperature interactions between the mold tooling material and two optical oxide glasses, Ohara's L-BAL35 and Schott's N-FK5. Flat molds were used to press flat glass work pieces at high temperature and force; key post process parameters such as sample and mold surface contamination using EDS and visible degradation via SEM were catalogued and analyzed. The molds used were bare tungsten carbide (WC) and silicon carbide (SiC) with an amorphous SiC chemical vapor deposition (CVD) coating. The results showed that raw WC molds suffered the most degradation including physical damage as well as chemical adherence and reaction. The Ti binder used in the WC as well as some the tungsten itself transferred to both glasses and caused a white reflective layer to appear on the molded glass surface. Severe damage was evident after only 2 pressing cycles with potassium from N-FK5 being the most prominent chemical contaminant. N-FK5 proved to be the more corrosive of the two glasses in all occasions. The SiC coated molds fared better in terms of degradation than the WC, however sticking of glass to mold was a problem.

The incorporation of the PFSILi ionene adds ionic conducting channels inside the electrodes and prevents electrolyte depletion during rapid charging-discharging. The small composition change results in an increase in the battery performance, including a better reversibility, lower polarization or internal resistance and an improved discharge capacity, as well as a higher energy density at high rates or elevated temperatures. At the rate of 2 C and 60 degrees C, the discharge plateau potential for the cell with the ionene based binder is 0.29 V higher than that for the cell with a PVDF only cathode binder. At a 4 C rate, the discharge capacity and energy density of a LiFePO4-Li half-cell with the ionic binder are 50% and 66%, respectively, higher than those of the cell using the nonionic PVDF binder at room temperature. Thus, the ionene polymer offers a new route, rather than just altering the active materials, to overcome the limitations of capacity and power density for rechargeable lithium batteries.									7	0	0	0	0	7			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000326984500026

Specific examples include the challenge of maintaining uniform temperatures or through-cure during thick-film radiative drying and curing processes in the face of the effective input's variation with film depth due to the so-called Beer-Lambert effect. These distributed parameter control problems are modeled with parabolic PDEs for the diffusion processes along with an in-domain input with a spatial attenuation function. The approach presented in this paper involves transforming the original model to an equivalent boundary input problem to which existing output feedback backstepping boundary control design methods can be applied. The resulting compensation scheme includes a mechanism for tuning the closed-loop performance. The performance of this scheme is compared with a controller designed via modal approximation of the PDE.

The proposed control algorithm directly aims to drive the carrying capacity of the vascular support network to a desired trajectory that reduces overall tumor volume. For this aim, we present a closed-loop smooth robust controller that ensures the asymptotic tracking of a time-varying carrying capacity profile, despite the model uncertainties. A Lyapunov-based analysis approach is used to determine stability and performance results. Numerical simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance and feasibility of the proposed approach. Simulation studies also examine some practical issues regarding the clinical application of the proposed dosing algorithm. Finally, the paper provides some basics for real-time implementation of the overall system.

Predictive fields are used for incorporating moving obstacle information into the navigation function framework. Navigation functions have been limited by geometric restrictions for robot workspaces and cannot easily be used in everyday environments. A methodical description of indoor workspaces such that they follow the constraints of a navigation function based path planner is proposed. Typical use of navigation function based path planners as a gradient based control input requires large scaling factors in practical use. A direction based control input, which eliminates the scaling factor altogether, is proposed and its stability and convergence is proved using Lyapunov-type analysis. The proposed algorithm improves the practicability of navigation functions and makes it possible to envisage a person following mobile robot operating in indoor environments using predictive field navigation.

IEEE					Stochastic Passivity of Discrete-Time Markovian Jump Nonlinear Systems								2013 AMERICAN CONTROL CONFERENCE (ACC)		Proceedings of the American Control Conference						4879	4884					2013	2013	In this paper, we analyze stochastic passivity of discrete-time Markovian jump nonlinear systems (MJNS). We define the notions of general stochastic dissipativity, stochastic QSR dissipativity and then stochastic passivity for these systems. Based on these definitions, the discrete-time stochastic KYP lemma is derived, which gives a necessary and sufficient condition for such a Markovian jump nonlinear system to be stochastic QSR dissipative. Based on the stochastic KYP lemma, we prove that a Markovian jump nonlinear system is locally stochastic feedback passive if and only if its zero dynamics are locally stochastic passive. Furthermore, we extend these results to interconnected MJNS. Given such interconnected subsystems that are stochastic feedback passive, we design a feedback control law and obtain the conditions on the weighted Laplacian matrix between all the subsystems to stabilize the entire system in the stochastic sense.

The rider's level of fatigue, upcoming elevation changes, and varying wind speed all contribute to the problem complexity. This paper formulates the pacing strategy for a bicycle time-trial as an optimal control problem with the goal of finishing in minimum time while considering pedaling force constraints imposed by velocity and rider's fatigue. A phenomenological dynamic model for a rider's fatigue is constructed and the model parameters are estimated using experimental data from road tests. Assuming prior knowledge of the route elevation profile, the optimal control problem is solved using dynamic programming which generates a feedback strategy: Given measured bicycle velocity and the estimated rider's state of fatigue, the solution suggests a pacing strategy that if followed can reduce total travel time. Preliminary simulation results based on experimental data from a century (100 mile) ride show the potentials of the proposed approach.

Recent experiments that illuminate this viewpoint are described, along with data analysis methodology. It is concluded that a fuller understanding will require interdisciplinary research devoted to an improved understanding of complex system behaviour. (C) 2013 The Authors.

J	Holladay, Patrick Joseph; Powell, Robert Baxter				McLean, Laurence /C-7367-2014				Resident perceptions of social-ecological resilience and the sustainability of community-based tourism development in the Commonwealth of Dominica								JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM				21	8			1188	1211		10.1080/09669582.2013.776059			2013	2013	Despite major investments in community-based tourism to diversify economies, reduce poverty and improve life quality in the Caribbean, little is known about what conditions lead to resilience and sustainability. Sustainability from a resilience theory perspective is the likelihood an existing system of resource use will persist indefinitely without a decline in social and natural resource bases. Undertaking activities to enhance resilience and sustainability improves a system's ability to persevere, adapt and learn to meet challenges from unanticipated economic, political or natural events. This study investigated six communities in the Commonwealth of Dominica, all part of a seven-year community tourism program, and examined residents' perceptions of the social, institutional, economic and ecological resilience of their community, and therefore the resilience and sustainability of community tourism development. It used a new scale using eight steps suggested by Devellis' scale development methodology. Data indicated moderate to low resilience in all four domains across the communities. This suggests that communities should invest in strengthening social bonds, developing capacity in local institutions, in diversifying the tourism product and controlling infrastructure development. Indicators measuring trust, networks, local control, flexible governance, leakage prevention and controlled infrastructure development emerged as important in assessing social-ecological resilience and sustainability.									10	2	0	1	0	11			0966-9582	1747-7646		WOS:000327394400005

Previously, cationic poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers have been proposed as novel, biocompatible oil dispersants. Here, we investigate the effect of such dendrimer oil dispersants on the soil amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, using phenanthrene as a model polyaromatic hydrocarbon. In examining cell culture proliferation and changes in membrane potential, we find that low concentrations of cationic generation-4 PAMAM dendrimers were non-toxic to Dictyostelium discoideum. In comparison, the same low concentration of the primary surfactant in the COREXIT oil dispersant, Tween 80, did display limited acute cytotoxicity. Higher concentrations of dendrimer oil dispersant elicited cytotoxicity due to significant depolarization of the cell membrane resulting from the uptake of highly cationic PAMAM dendrimers. Cellular uptake of cationic PAMAM dendrimers was confirmed by a cellular association experiment conducted at room temperature and 2 degrees C, using fluorescence imaging. The uptake and corresponding membrane depolarization was found to be significantly inhibited by the presence of phenanthrene within and around the periphery of the dendrimers. This study offers new insight into the environmental implications of oil dispersants.									4	0	0	1	0	4			2046-2069			WOS:000327261700062		
S	Qiu, Chenxi; Yu, Lei; Shen, Haiying; Soltani, Sohraab			IEEE					Low-Latency Multi-flow Broadcasts in Fading Wireless Networks								2013 PROCEEDINGS IEEE INFOCOM		IEEE INFOCOM						455	459					2013	2013	Cooperative broadcast, in which a packet receiver cooperatively combines received weak signal power from different senders to decode the original packet, has gained increasing attention. However, existing approaches are developed based on the assumption that there is a single flow in the network; thus, they are not suitable for multi-flow broadcasting in which broadcasts are initiated by different nodes and consist of more than one packet at any point in time. In this paper, we aim to achieve low-latency multi-flow broadcast in wireless multi-hop networks with fading channels. We formulate this problem as a Minimum Slotted Delay Cooperative Broadcast (MSDCB) problem, and prove that it is NP-complete and o(logN) inapproximable. We then propose two heuristic algorithms named PCBH-S and PCBH-M to solve MSDCB. Our experimental results show that our algorithms outperform previous methods.					32nd IEEE INFOCOM Conference32nd IEEE INFOCOM Conference	APR 14-19, 2013APR 14-19, 2013	IEEEIEEE	Turin, ITALYTurin, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0743-166X		978-1-4673-5946-7	WOS:000326335200099		
S	Qiu, Chenxi; Shen, Haiying; Soltani, Sohraab; Sapra, Karan; Jiang, Hao; Hallstrom, Jason			IEEE					CEDAR: An Optimal and Distributed Strategy for Packet Recovery in Wireless Networks								2013 PROCEEDINGS IEEE INFOCOM		IEEE INFOCOM						2859	2867					2013	2013	Underlying link-layer protocols of wireless networks use the conventional "store and forward" design paradigm cannot provide highly sustainable reliability and stability in wireless communication, which introduce significant barriers and setbacks in scalability and deployments of wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a Code Embedded Distributed Adaptive and Reliable (CEDAR) link-layer framework that targets low latency and high throughput. CEDAR is the first comprehensive theoretical framework for analyzing and designing distributed and adaptive error recovery for wireless networks. It employs a theoretically-sound framework for embedding channel codes in each packet and performs the error correcting process in selected intermediate nodes in packet's route. To identify the intermediate nodes for the en/decoding for minimizing average packet latency, we mathematically analyze the average packet delay, using Finite State Markovian Channel model and priority queuing model, and then formalize the problem as a non-linear integer programming problem. Also, we propose a scalable and distributed scheme to solve this problem. The results from real-world testbed "NESTbed" and simulation with Matlab prove that CEDAR is superior to the schemes using hop-by-hop decoding and destination-decoding not only in packet delay but also in throughput. In addition, the simulation results show that CEDAR can achieve the optimal performance in most cases.					32nd IEEE INFOCOM Conference32nd IEEE INFOCOM Conference	APR 14-19, 2013APR 14-19, 2013	IEEEIEEE	Turin, ITALYTurin, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0743-166X		978-1-4673-5946-7	WOS:000326335202110

Anomalous Currents in Low Voltage Polymer Tantalum Capacitors								ECS JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				2	11			N197	N204		10.1149/2.046309jss			2013	2013	Low voltage Polymer Ta capacitors fabricated with porous Ta anodes, anodic oxide films of Ta as a dielectric, and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) cathodes were investigated. The polymer cathodes were formed by either pure in-situ polymerization or hybrid polymerization, with in-situ PEDOT inside the porous anodes and a pre-polymerized PEDOT cathode on the external surface of the anodes. Anomalous transient current, DC leakage, and breakdown voltage were observed and investigated at normal and reverse polarities in a broad range of temperatures and voltages. Anomalously high transient current in the ampere range was observed when a pulse of rated voltage at normal polarity (+ on the Ta anode) was applied to the capacitors, and anomalous DC current was observed when rated voltage was applied at low temperature. This effect was significantly more pronounced in the hybrid devices, but significantly decreased in all cases with humidification. The anomalous currents were explained by the presence of dipoles, charged polymer chains, in the conducting polymer cathode at its interface with the dielectric. (C) 2013 The Electrochemical Society.

Seven laziness indicators are described. These indicators are used to evaluate individual vehicle components to aid in identifying mass reduction potential and focus the attention of designers on components or assemblies with high potential for mass reduction. This method is applied to a complete automotive vehicle, demonstrating a mass savings potential of the overall vehicle of approximately 5% of the total mass of the vehicle.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0143-3369	1741-5314		WOS:000326931400002

The three impact factors are quantified to develop an overall underground sustainability index rating (USIR) for evaluating utility projects with competing installation technologies. The main contribution to the overall body of knowledge is the demonstration of a method for calculating a sustainability index that enables decision makers to quantify public works utility projects with guidance for evaluating proposed technologies based on environmental impact, costs, and social impact criteria. The aim is to help change the myopic thought process of typical public works owners who typically base contractor selection on lowest cost, rather than examining sustainability factors. An emission calculator was used in this research to quantify environmental impact by comparing six airborne emissions: carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM), nitrogen oxide (NOx), sulfur oxide (SOx), and hydrocarbons (HC). Costs were determined by estimating competing technology options including surface restoration. Social impacts were quantified by comparing and rating 13 factors affecting underground utility projects. The approach to calculating the USIR was demonstrated on a case study installation of 313m (1,026 linear feet) of 400mm (16in.) PVC sanitary sewer in a mature neighborhood in Portland, Oregon. The USIRs were compared for open-cut, pilot tube microtunneling, horizontal directional drilling, and vacuum microtunneling technology options.

Barriers and Facilitators of Mental Health Treatment Seeking Among Active-Duty Army Personnel								MILITARY PSYCHOLOGY				25	5			514	535		10.1037/mil0000015			2013	2013	The purpose of the current two-phase study was to comprehensively identify the barriers and facilitators of mental health treatment seeking among active-duty service members. For Sample 1, focus groups were conducted with a general sample (n = 78) of United States soldiers. For Sample 2, interviews were conducted with soldiers who had sought mental health treatment (n = 32). Transcripts were coded using Atlas.ti software (Berlin, Germany), and descriptive analyses identified key themes. Factors identified by this study that have been underinvestigated in previous research included medication concerns, discomfort with discussing mental health problems, beliefs promoted by military culture, positive leader behaviors, and witnessing treatment seekers' experiences. Common barriers included career concerns, stigma, treatment concerns, leadership problems, and practical barriers. Common facilitators included social support, leadership support, and perceived symptom severity. Findings suggest that treatment-facilitating interventions should reframe treatment-inhibiting perceptions, change leader behaviors, and employ testimonials.									16	0	0	2	0	16			0899-5605	1532-7876		WOS:000327059100009

This paper discusses the findings of an exploratory study aimed at understanding the current practices, information needs, and challenges of older adults (65 years and older) when selecting over-the-counter (OTC) medication. The context of this study lies in understanding older adults with the purpose of identifying opportunities for a consumer health application to assist them with selecting an appropriate OTC medication based on their health history. This research contributes to the understanding of the current practices of older adults as related to OTC medication selection. In addition, this paper provides a discussion of opportunities for future applications to help facilitate this task for older adults.					7th International Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare (PervasiveHealth)7th International Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare (PervasiveHealth)	MAY 05-08, 2013MAY 05-08, 2013		Venice, ITALYVenice, ITALY	1	0	0	1	0	1			2153-1633		978-1-936968-80-0; 978-1-4799-0296-5	WOS:000326842700016

Two models exist for explaining those fluctuations, as well as the apparent truncation of data for those elements for stars having metallicity of [Fe/H] < -3.5. We study the factors that place upper limits on the logarithmic ratio [Sr/Ba] in the two models. A model has been developed in which the collapse of type II supernovae may produce a pronounced [Sr/Ba] enhancement in single-site r-process enriched stars. This model is consistent with galactic chemical constraints of light-element enrichment in metal-poor stars.

The collagen content of the adult heart valve, as estimated by hydroxyproline assay, increases three times as compared with fetal heart valves. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that the diameter of collagen fibrils increased in adult heart valves compared with fetal heart valves. The level of collagen cross-linking is lower in the fetal heart valve than the adult heart valve. The reported age differences in the material properties of fetal and adult porcine heart valves were associated with increases in collagen content, the diameter of collagen fibrils and the level of collagen cross-linking. These data lay a foundation for systematic elucidation of the structural determinants of material properties of heart valves during embryonic and postnatal valvulogenesis. They are also essential to define the desirable level of tissue maturation in heart valve tissue engineering.									8	0	0	4	0	8			0300-8207	1607-8438		WOS:000326752400008	23869611

To understand the relationship between adsorption coefficients and physicochemical properties of aromatic compounds, a 3D quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) model was developed by the utilization of 3D molecular structures of 39 aromatic compounds. A Monte Carlo computational algorithm was utilized to generate 3D molecular descriptors and physicochemical properties for the QSPR model. Of the physicochemical descriptors: log Kow, number of nitrogen and oxygen atoms and number of atoms in rings present positive correlation. However, the dipole moment of the molecule and number of hydrogen bonds accepted by the solute present negative correlations. In the model development process, three different learning approaches, multiple linear regression (MLR), artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM), were used. The validation results showed that SVM-and ANN-based models resulted in a better agreement between predicted and measured values, with the coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.8317 and 0.7829, than the MLR-based model with R2 of 0.5093.									10	1	0	2	0	10			2046-2069			WOS:000326745100005

The phase-only SLM shapes an incoming mode-locked, near-infrared Ti:sapphire laser beam into multiple specific discrete-lines, which are designed according to the sizes and locations of the target samples. Only the target-sample areas of are scanned one-dimensionally, resulting in an efficient use of the laser's power. Compared with conventional multiphoton microscopies, this technique shortens scanning time and minimizes photodamage by concentrating scanning energy and dwell time on the areas of interest. Additionally, our discrete-line-focus design eliminates the cross-talk that occurs in conventional one-dimensional line-scanning multiphoton microscopes, thus enhancing the lateral and axial resolutions of the line-scanning imaging system.

Overall, actin displayed a higher propensity than tubulin for silver nanoparticles while both proteins experienced conformational changes upon binding. Conversely, ion release from silver nanoparticles was significantly compromised upon the formation of protein biocoronas, as shown by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. The implications of cytoskeletal protein biocorona on the transformation and cytotoxicity of silver nanoparticles have been discussed.									5	0	0	4	0	5			2046-2069			WOS:000326056600123

At a concentration of wsCNPs around 0.5 mg L-1, the full life cycle of the mosquito has been successfully imaged. However, at higher concentrations of wsCNPs (3 mg L-1), the growth of the mosquito from the larval stage to adulthood is blocked. Larvae ingesting such high concentrations of wsCNPs did not survive and after four weeks perished. The zebra fish can use such infected larvae as food with no ill effect, suggesting a new method to curb mosquito growth in stagnant pools of water treated with wsCNPs without affecting the ecosystem.									11	0	0	2	1	11			2046-2069			WOS:000326056600189

Secondary metabolites composition is key to the influence of the pharmaceutical and commercial qualities of this plant. In this work, the phytochemical profile of Z. jujuba seeds was analysed by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The UPLC-MS/MS information identified the main secondary metabolites in Z. jujuba seeds, including flavonoid C-glycosides, triterpene acids and unsaturated fatty acids. The leading chemical identified by UPLC-MS/MS was betulinic acid, and oleic acid was the leading volatile from the GC-MS results. All the samples tested showed similar phytochemical profiles, but levels of the chemical compounds varied. Principal component analysis revealed the principal secondary metabolites that could define the differences in quality. It was confirmed that the combination of UPLC-MS/MS and GC-MS was an effective technique to demonstrate the pharmaceutical quality of Z. jujuba seeds.									9	0	0	8	0	9			0003-2654	1364-5528		WOS:000325819300023	24071816	
B	Peasley, Brian; Birchfield, Stan			IEEE					Real-Time Obstacle Detection and Avoidance in the Presence of Specular Surfaces Using an Active 3D Sensor								2013 IEEE WORKSHOP ON ROBOT VISION (WORV)								197	202					2013	2013	This paper proposes a novel approach to obstacle detection and avoidance using a 3D sensor. We depart from the approach of previous researchers who use depth images from 3D sensors projected onto UV-disparity to detect obstacles. Instead, our approach relies on projecting 3D points onto the ground plane, which is estimated during a calibration step. A 2D occupancy map is then used to determine the presence of obstacles, from which translation and rotation velocities are computed to avoid the obstacles. Two innovations are introduced to overcome the limitations of the sensor: An infinite pole approach is proposed to hypothesize infinitely tall, thin obstacles when the sensor yields invalid readings, and a control strategy is adopted to turn the robot away from scenes that yield a high percentage of invalid readings. Together, these extensions enable the system to overcome the inherent limitations of the sensor. Experiments in a variety of environments, including dynamic objects, obstacles of varying heights, and dimly-lit conditions, show the ability of the system to perform robust obstacle avoidance in real time under realistic indoor conditions.

In general, worms are exposed to a dose of mutagen resulting in DNA damages and mutations. Screening the progeny of the mutagenized animals for a certain phenotype is the regular forward genetic approach in C. elegans. A mutant selected from such a population is stabilized to recover a pure homozygous strain. In this chapter, we categorize the protocol into mutagenesis, phenotype screen, and outcross and provide time-tested procedures for their implementation to create long-lived worm mutants.									8	0	0	6	0	8			1064-3745		978-1-62703-556-9; 978-1-62703-555-2	WOS:000325584400007	23929098

In many of these lasers, fiber nonlinearities are the main limits to further scaling. Although numerous specific techniques have studied for the suppression of a wide range of nonlinearities, the fundamental solution is to scale mode areas in fibers while maintaining sufficient single mode operation. Here the key problem is that more modes are supported once physical dimensions of waveguides are increased. The key to solve this problem is to look for fiber designs with significant higher order mode suppression. In conventional waveguides, all modes are increasingly guided in the center of the waveguides when waveguide dimensions are increased. It is hard to couple a mode out in order to suppress its propagation, which severely limits their scalability. In an all-solid photonic bandgap fiber, modes are only guided due to anti-resonance of cladding photonic crystal lattice. This provides strongly mode-dependent guidance, leading to very high differential mode losses. In addition, the all-solid nature of the fiber makes it easily spliced to other fibers. In this paper, we will show for the first time that all-solid photonic bandgap fibers with effective mode area of similar to 920 mu m(2) can be made with excellent higher order mode suppression.

S	Dragic, Peter D.; Hawkins, Thomas; Foy, Paul; Morris, Stephanie; Ballato, John						Hendow, ST		All-Glass Optical Fibers Derived From Sapphire								FIBER LASERS X: TECHNOLOGY, SYSTEMS, AND APPLICATIONS		Proceedings of SPIE		8601						86010I	10.1117/12.999361			2013	2013	Increasing power levels and novel applications are demanding from fibers performance capabilities that have, to-date, not been realized. One such example arises from the nascent push towards the 10-kW power threshold for narrow linewidth fiber lasers designed for applications including coherently-phased laser arrays and spectroscopic lidars. It is well-known that Brillouin scattering still restricts continued power scaling in these systems, despite several recent advances in acoustic-wave Brillouin management. Accordingly, novel fibers possessing a Brillouin gain coefficient 10 dB or more less than previously demonstrated would be of great practical benefit if they comprise novel materials in simple geometries and are manufactured using industry-accepted methods. Introducing a new and effective approach to the management of Brillouin scattering, we present on all-glass optical fibers derived from silica-clad sapphire with alumina concentrations up to 55 mole percent; considerably greater than conventionally possible enabling the design of optical fiber possessing a series of essential properties. Markedly, a Brillouin gain coefficient of 3.1 x 10(-13) m/W was measured for a fiber with an average alumina concentration of 54 mole percent. This value is nearly 100 times lower than standard commercial single-mode fiber and is likely the lowest ever specified value. This reduction in Brillouin gain is enabled by a number of key material properties of the alumina-silica system, amazingly even leading to a predicted, but not yet demonstrated, composition with zero Brillouin gain. Optical fiber materials with these and other crucial properties will be discussed in the context high energy fiber laser systems.

More specifically, MCVD-derived germanosilicate fibers were fabricated that exhibited a gradient of up to about 0.55 weight % GeO2 per meter. These gradients are about 1900 times greater than previously reported fibers possessing longitudinal changes in composition. The refractive index difference is shown to change by about 0.001, representing a numerical aperture change of about 10%, over a fiber length of less than 20 m. The lowest attenuation measured from the present longitudinally-graded fiber (LGF) was 82 dB/km at a wavelength of 1550 nm, though this is shown to result from extrinsic process-induced factors and could be reduced with further optimization. The stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) spectrum from the LGF exhibited a 4.4 dB increase in the spectral width, and thus reduction in Brillouin gain, relative to a standard commercial single mode fiber, over a fiber length of only 17 m. The method employed is very straight-forward and provides for a wide variety of longitudinal refractive index and acoustic velocity profiles, as well as core shapes, which could be especially valuable for SBS suppression in high-energy laser systems. Next generation analogs, with longitudinally-graded compositional profiles that are very reasonable to fabricate, are shown computationally to be more effective at suppressing SBS than present alternatives, such as externally-applied temperature or strain gradients.

It is currently limited by stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS). In recent years, a variety of techniques have been investigated for the suppression of SBS in optical fibers. A notable example is to design transverse acoustic properties of optical fibers in order to minimize optical and acoustic mode overlap. It was pointed out recently that SBS suppression from such transverse acoustic tailoring is limited when considering the existence of acoustic leaky modes. We demonstrate, for the first time, a post-processing technique where hydrogen is diffused in to a fiber core and then locally and permanently bonded to core glass by a subsequent UV exposure. Large local acoustic property can be altered this way for significant SBS suppression. It is also possible to use this technique to implement precisely tailored acoustic properties along a fiber for more optimized SBS suppression in a fiber amplifier. Change in Brillouin Stokes frequency of similar to 320MHz at 1.064 mu m has been demonstrated using hydrogen, corresponding to a SBS suppression of similar to 8dB. Much higher SBS suppression is possible at higher hydrogen concentrations.

Correlating lignin structural features to phase partitioning behavior in a novel aqueous fractionation of softwood Kraft black liquor								GREEN CHEMISTRY				15	10			2904	2912		10.1039/c3gc41182f			2013	2013	In this work, a set of softwood lignins were recovered from a Kraft black liquor using a novel pH-based fractionation process involving sequential CO2 acidification and separation of the solvated aqueous lignin fraction. These recovered lignin fractions were characterized with respect to properties that may be responsible for their phase partitioning behavior as well as properties that may render the lignins more suitable for materials applications. Lignin fractions were recovered between a pH range of 12.8 and 9.5 with the bulk of the lignin (90%) recovered between a pH of 11.1 and 10.0. While all the fractions were found to consist primarily of lignin as validated by sample methoxyl content, the first fractions to phase separated were found to be especially enriched in aliphatic extractives and polysaccharides. From the bulk of the lignin that was recovered between a pH of 11.1 and 10.0 a number of noteworthy trends were discernible from the data. Specifically, the phenolic hydroxyl content was found to exhibit a strong negative correlation to the fractionation pH and exhibited a nearly 50% increase with recovery at decreasing pH, while the GPC-estimated molecular weights and C-13 NMR-estimated beta-O-4 content showed strong positive correlations to the pH at recovery. The aliphatic hydroxyl content exhibited minimal differences between recovery conditions. Overall, these results suggest that this fractionation approach can generate lignin fractions enriched in select physical or structural properties that may be important for their application as feedstocks for renewable chemicals or materials.									21	2	0	5	0	22			1463-9262	1463-9270		WOS:000325593600035

First, the myofibrils shrank to shorten the sarcomere length. At the cell ends, the striated pattern of myosin filaments began to dissociate; at the center of the cell, the striated pattern of alpha-actinin first faded away and reappeared near the cell membrane during dedifferentiation. The results suggest that when freshly isolated adult cardiomyocytes are used to model cardiac muscle, the end-to-end connection may be important to maintain their striated myofibrillar structure and rod-shape morphology.

J	Cho, Byung Rae; Choi, Yongsun; Shin, Sangmun								APPLICATIONS OF QUALITY IMPROVEMENT AND ROBUST DESIGN METHODS TO A PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING-THEORY APPLICATIONS AND PRACTICE				20	3-4			289	U109					2013	2013	Researchers often identify robust design, based on the concept of building quality into products or processes, as one of the most important systems engineering design concepts for quality improvement and process optimization. Traditional robust design principles have often been applied to situations in which the quality characteristics of interest are typically time-insensitive. In pharmaceutical manufacturing processes, time-oriented quality characteristics, such as the degradation of a drug, are often of interest. As a result, current robust design models for quality improvement which have been studied in the literature may not be effective in finding robust design solutions. In this paper, we show how the robust design concepts can be applied to the pharmaceutical production research and development by proposing experimental and optimization models which should be able to handle the time-oriented characteristics. This is perhaps the first attempt in the robust design field. An example is given and comparative studies are discussed for model verification.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1943-670X			WOS:000325651000006		
J	Lee, T. -K.; Filipi, Z. S.								Representative Midwestern US Cycles: Synthesis and Applications								OIL & GAS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-REVUE D IFP ENERGIES NOUVELLES				68	1			117	126		10.2516/ogst/2012045			JAN-FEB 2013	2013	This paper proposed a set of representative real-world driving cycles in Midwestern US, which are capable of capturing the dependence of driving patterns on driving distance. Recent analyses of the real-world driving in USA show that most of certification cycles lead to underestimation of energy consumption per mile compared to the naturalistic driving patterns. Real-world driving is a mix of local driving and highway driving. Furthermore, the driving patterns show high dependency on the driving distance. To cover the wide range of real-world driving distances, five synthetic cycles are generated ranging from 4.78 miles to 40.71 miles following the real-world driving distance distribution. Each individual cycle is constructed by a stochastic process using the extracted driving information from the naturalistic trip data in the Midwestern US. While constructing the cycle set, the statistical criteria for validating the cycle representativeness are processed to capture the clear distance dependency and remove random variations. The synthesized cycles are subsequently used for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEVs) or Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEVs) design and control studies for the assessment of the impact of electrified vehicles on the grid.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1294-4475	1953-8189		WOS:000325598400011

Infected toenails of 12 patients were treated over a 3 month period using both long pulse and Q-switched laser output pulses. Our results compared favorably to Neodymium Yittrium Aluminum Garnet (Nd: YAG) laser fungus treatment studies as reported in literature. Nd: YAG laser devices, operating in the Near Infra-Red, (NIR) region at 1064nm, have recently become an effective alternative treatment to traditional oral medications used to treat nail fungal infections. Conventional nail infection treatments employ medications such as allylamines, azoles and other classes of antifungal drugs that are unpopular due to numerous side-affects and drug interactions. Side-effects of these drugs include headache, itching, loss of sense of taste, nausea, diarrhea, heart failure and even potential death from liver failure [1,2,3]. The effectiveness of conventional oral antifungal medications varies. In addition, antifungal prescription drugs are administered for long periods ranging from 6 weeks to 18 months. Nd: YAG antifungal laser treatment reports claim high success rates (65-95%) in eradicating toenail fungus and without adverse side-affects. Multiple laser treatments are administered over a 3 to 6 month period [4,5,6,7]. Our initial treatments performed with the Er: glass laser on toenail fungus patients required only 1 to 2 treatments for cure. This same SWIR laser was used in experiments to treat Athlete's Foot fungal infections. The 1534nm Er: glass laser emission has been found to be well optimized for dermatological treatments due high transmission properties of human skin in the SWIR region. Increased depth of tissue penetration is well-tolerated and provides for effective treatment of various skin conditions. [8,9,10,11] "Eye-safe" Class I lasers provide for practical skin and nail tissue treatment without the need for eye-protection goggles. Laser safety filters may inhibit a practitioner's vision and ability to distinguish skin and nail regions exhibiting different colors and textures. The laser is "eye-safe" due to the fact that Megawatt peak power Q-switched lasers operating at 1.54um in the narrow spectral window between 1.4um and 1.6um are approximately 8000 times more eye-safe than other laser devices operating in the visible and near infrared. Long-pulse or free running lasers operating in this wavelength range are similar to 2000 times more eye-safe [12].

B	Yang, Fan; Wang, Kuang-Ching; Huang, Yong			ASME					EXPERIMENTAL STUDY OF DATA TRANSMISSION PERFORMANCE FOR ROTATING WIRELESS SENSORS USING AUTOMATIC REPEAT REQUEST								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME/ISCIE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON FLEXIBLE AUTOMATION, ISFA 2012								239	244					2013	2013	IEEE 802.15.4 wireless sensor radios have limited resources, resulting in a higher probability of transmission errors in monitoring fast rotating structures such as the machinery spindle. To achieve reliable data transmission with wireless sensors, one feasible approach is to use automatic repeat request (ARQ) where packets that are not acknowledged are retransmitted immediately after timeout. The objective of this paper is to experimentally study the ARQ-based data transmission performance of IEEE 802.15.4 wireless sensor radios on a mechanical rotation apparatus. Using a specially designed rotation apparatus, the ARQ-based data transmission performance has been studied in terms of the data throughput and packet error rate (PER). It is found that ARQ is able to improve the data throughput performance and decrease the cycle PER at the cost of degrading the transmission energy efficiency. A throughput model is further proposed and validated for rotating wireless sensors when ARQ is implemented.

This variability can make standard errors sufficiently large that mean separation between treatment and control groups can be difficult without replicating numbers (n) of animals in groups by excessive amounts. Here, we describe the materials and protocol necessary for delivering a standardized non-transmural cryoinjury to the left ventricle of an adult mouse heart that may in part obviate the issue of injury variance between animals. As reported previously, this cryoinjury model generates a necrotic wound to the ventricle of consistent size and shape that resolves into a scar of uniform size, shape, and organization. The cryo-model also provides an extended injury border zone that exhibits classic markers of remodeling found in surviving cardiac tissue at the edge of a myocardial infarction, including connexin43 (Cx43) lateralization. In a further extension of the method, we describe how we have adapted the model to deliver a cryoinjury to the apex of the heart of neonatal mice-a modification that may be useful for studies of myocardial regeneration in mammals.									17	0	0	11	0	17			1064-3745		978-1-62703-505-7; 978-1-62703-504-0	WOS:000325609000021	24029946

Research in rehabilitation science has demonstrated that movement recovery is facilitated by extended task practice. However, 75% of stroke survivors are unable to successfully practice reaching tasks, due to the severity of the impairment of elbow and wrist movements. We hypothesize that expert action observation-observing normal avatar movement in response to impaired UE movement-may promote greater brain learning and contribute to greater UE movement recovery for patients with severe limitations of elbow and wrist movement.To incorporate extended task practice and expert action observation into current therapy, we have developed and begun initial exploratory testing of Duck Duck Punch, a 3D serious game for stroke neurorehabilitation. A Microsoft Kinect motion tracking sensor allows a stroke survivor to interact with the virtual game by moving their impaired arm. The visual display of a corresponding avatar arm enables a patient with impaired movement in the real world to appear to have normal movement in the virtual game environment. Data from a preliminary study suggests that our system may be effective in aiding in rehabilitation, especially in improving reaching efficiency and reducing abnormal movements.

We evaluated whether a single interaction metaphor of mouse and keyboard for both virtual and GUI sub-systems of our simulation was superior in terms of user preference and performance to a dual interaction metaphor of using touchscreen for the virtual environment while using mouse and keyboard for the GUI. User preference and performance both indicate that the single interaction metaphor was more usable, although each technique was sufficiently usable for accomplishing simulation goals.

We have examined the strong magnetic fields generated by kinetic shear (Kelvin-Helmholtz) instabilities. Compared to the previous studies using counter-streaming performed by Alves et al. (2012), the structure of the kinetic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KKHI) of our jet-sheath configuration is slightly different, even for the global evolution of the strong transverse magnetic field. In our simulations the major components of growing modes are the electric field E-z, perpendicular to the flow boundary, and the magnetic field B-y, transverse to the flow direction. After the B-y component is excited, an induced electric field E-x, parallel to the flow direction, becomes significant. However, other field components remain small. We find that the structure and growth rate of KKHI with mass ratios m(i)/m(e) = 1836 and m(i)/m(e) = 20 are similar. In our simulations in the nonlinear stage is not as clear as in counter-streaming cases. The growth rate for a mildly-relativistic jet case (gamma(j) = 1.5) is larger than for a relativistic jet case (gamma(j) = 15).									11	0	0	0	0	11			0992-7689			WOS:000325345800005

In this study, deltamethrin was used as an active ingredient, corn oil was used as a lipid medium, soybean lecithin and Tween-80 were used as surfactants. At 25 degrees C, the solubility of deltamethrin in SSD solution prepared by solvent-mediated method was 3.4 times and 1.5 times higher than that in saturated deltamethrin (SD) solution and that in SSD solution prepared by thermal-mediated method, respectively. Therefore, compared to the use of SD solution for the production of nanocarriers, the use of SSD solution significantly enhanced the payload, while keeping the encapsulation efficiency high. Particularly, nanocarriers produced from SSD solution prepared by solvent-mediated method had the higher payload of 2.1 times and 4.4 times compared with preparations using SSD solution prepared by thermal-mediated method and SD solution, respectively.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0265-2048			WOS:000325357300005	23425086	
J	Roth, Philip L.; Huffcutt, Allen I.								A Meta-Analysis of Interviews and Cognitive Ability Back to the Future?								JOURNAL OF PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY				12	4			157	169		10.1027/1866-5888/a000091			2013	2013	The topic of what interviews measure has received a great deal of attention over the years. One line of research has investigated the relationship between interviews and the construct of cognitive ability. A previous meta-analysis reported an overall corrected correlation of .40 (Huffcutt, Roth, & McDaniel, 1996). A more recent meta-analysis reported a noticeably lower corrected correlation of .27 (Berry, Sackett, & Landers, 2007). After reviewing both meta-analyses, it appears that the two studies posed different research questions. Further, there were a number of coding judgments in Berry et al. that merit review, and there was no moderator analysis for educational versus employment interviews. As a result, we reanalyzed the work by Berry et al. and found a corrected correlation of .42 for employment interviews (.15 higher than Berry et al., a 56% increase). Further, educational interviews were associated with a corrected correlation of .21, supporting their influence as a moderator. We suggest a better estimate of the correlation between employment interviews and cognitive ability is .42, and this takes us "back to the future'' in that the better overall estimate of the employment interviews - cognitive ability relationship is roughly .40. This difference has implications for what is being measured by interviews and their incremental validity.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1866-5888			WOS:000324915200001

The effect of metal ion binding on the photophysical properties of the polyelectrolyte was probed. By binding metal ions to the polycation, the relative charge loading could be progressively increased as a strategy to control its supramolecular assembly with polyanions. The metallated and metal-free polyelectrolytes were utilized in layer-by-layer self-assembly with poly(acrylic acid) or anionic conjugated polymers including a poly(p-phenylene vinylene) and polythiophene derivative. The photophysical properties, nanomorphology, and substrate dependence of the resultant multilayer films were examined, and indicate that layer density, composition, and morphology can be tuned by metallation and ion pairing effects.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1759-9954			WOS:000325405300003

The application of subcritical fluids for the stabilization of marine archaeological iron								STUDIES IN CONSERVATION				58	4			314	325		10.1179/2047058412Y.0000000079			2013	2013	The long-term stabilization of marine archaeological iron, whether cast or wrought, continues to challenge conservators responsible for treatment of this material. Results and observations obtained from past treatments highlight the daunting, prolonged, and laborious efforts required to desalinate large and complex ferrous artifacts recovered from the ocean. In general, the higher an artifact's chloride level, the less stable it is. Consequently, any stabilization treatment must involve the removal of as much Cl-1 as possible without affecting the integrity of the corroded artifact. This problem is particularly acute with corroding cast iron objects that have formed thick, fragile, and highly unstable corrosion layers. Over the course of the twentieth century, conservators have used a variety of techniques in an attempt to mitigate the negative effects of chloride ions on iron artifacts and prevent disintegration. In spite of early promise, each of these stabilization techniques has significant disadvantages, particularly with regard to treatment efficiency, duration of treatment, and/or unacceptable risks to the artifact during treatment. For these reasons, conservators and conservation scientists at the Warren Lasch Conservation Center in Charleston, South Carolina, decided to look at the possibility of using subcritical fluids to stabilize archaeological iron. This paper compares the efficiency and effectiveness of traditional stabilization techniques (i.e. alkaline soaking and cathodic polarization) to subcritical fluids on wrought iron rivets and metal shavings from the H. L. Hunley submarine as well as Civil War era cast iron artillery shells recovered from a marine environment.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0039-3630			WOS:000325138600005

With the target veins so close to the lungs and vital arteries, mistakes during this procedure can be fatal. Unfortunately, it is particularly challenging for students to learn this procedure and is often practiced by novice students on live patients as current simulators are ineffective. Simulators on the market are expensive, inconvenient, and often anatomically inaccurate, leading to improper student training. To address the shortcomings of current simulators, our patent-pending design includes features such as a fully rotatable head and proper anatomical landmarks. Our training simulator is ultrasoundable and can replicate both the pulsing of the arteries and the expanding of the veins under changes in fluid pressure. In addition, our simulator comes with training software allowing for tracking of students as they progress through the curriculum. We are currently performing usability testing of our prototype. Novice residents and expert practicing doctors perform CVC on our simulator for assessment of accuracy, ease of use, and training effectiveness in comparison to commercially available simulators.					29th Southern Biomedical Engineering Conference (SBEC)29th Southern Biomedical Engineering Conference (SBEC)	MAY 03-05, 2013MAY 03-05, 2013	IEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc; Tucker Davis Technologies; Univ Miami Biomed Engn; Delsys; Univ Florida, J Crayton Pruitt Family Dept Biomed Engn; IEEE Comp Soc; Florida Int Univ, Coll Engn & Comp, Dept Biomed EngnIEEE Engn Med & Biol Soc; Tucker Davis Technologies; Univ Miami Biomed Engn; Delsys; Univ Florida, J Crayton Pruitt Family Dept Biomed Engn; IEEE Comp Soc; Florida Int Univ, Coll Engn & Comp, Dept Biomed Engn	Miami, FLMiami, FL	0	0	0	0	0	0			1086-4105		978-0-7695-5032-9	WOS:000324751700047

The authors seek to extend existing theory by examining the impact of logistical business continuity planning (LBCP) - BCP in the context of logistics - on firms' operational capabilities and financial performance.Design/methodology/approach - Using data of firms operating in the US transportation and warehousing industries, the authors empirically test LBCP's affect on their business units' financial performance.Findings - The authors' findings suggest that LBCP influences financial performance via improvement in logistical competitive capability and enhanced disaster immunity. Further, the findings indicate that when a firm employs mindful-planning processes, an important element within LBCP, it can avoid the trade-off between risk management and efficiency.

In this work, a hot deformation induced in situ nanostructuring process is directly applied to the commercial unidirectionally grown p-type Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 ingots to explore the possibility of commercial application of the "top down" nanostructuring approach, and the thermoelectric properties are investigated over a wide temperature range of 15 K to 520 K. In comparison to the commercial zone melted ingot and the hot pressed sample, it is found that the hot deformed samples exhibit much less texture and significantly reduced lattice thermal conductivity due to in situ formed nanostructures and defects. A high ZT of similar to 1.3 is achieved near room temperature, similar to 50% improvement compared to that of the zone melted ingot. The hot deformation process thus provides a promising top down approach to prepare high performance Bi2Te3 based thermoelectric materials in a way that is more readily incorporated into the existing procedure of device manufacturing.									24	0	0	0	0	24			2050-7488			WOS:000324409700013		
J	McAlister, Justin S.; Moran, Amy L.				Moran, Amy/F-7072-2011				Effects of variation in egg energy and exogenous food on larval development in congeneric sea urchins								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				490				155	167		10.3354/meps10420			2013	2013	Planktotrophic larvae of marine invertebrates develop and grow by utilizing a combination of endogenous materials contained in the egg and exogenous food consumed during development. In general, larger eggs contain more reserves for morphogenesis and metabolism than smaller eggs. Interspecific comparisons among planktotrophic echinoderms have generally found that increased maternal provisioning decreases the length of development in the plankton, leading to the widely held idea that large eggs are likely to be selectively favored in low-food or high-mortality environments. Despite long interest in these patterns, however, few studies have examined how exogenous and endogenous supplies interactively affect larval development in phylogenetically controlled and environmentally relevant contexts. We investigated the direct and interactive effects of both endogenous egg materials and exogenous food supply on larval performance of 3 closely related tropical sea urchin species (Echinometra spp.). We found that egg size was positively correlated with egg energy among these 3 species, and that larvae of species with larger (and more energy-rich) eggs developed more rapidly than those from smaller (and lower-energy) eggs. Likewise, across species, larvae fed higher rations grew more rapidly than those fed less. Length of development was most strongly affected by food level in the species with the smallest eggs. Compared to the lowest food treatment, satiating levels shortened development by 9, 7, and 4 d for E. vanbrunti, E. lucunter, and E. viridis, respectively (listed in order of increasing egg energy). Our study supports the hypothesis that the growth and development of larvae are more strongly affected by exogenous food availability when they develop from lower-energy eggs than when larvae develop from energy-rich eggs.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000324550600013

Upon entering physiological environments, nanoparticles readily assume the form of a nanoparticle-protein corona that dictates their biological identity. Consequently, understanding the structure and dynamics of a nanoparticle-protein corona is essential for predicting the fate, transport, and toxicity of nanomaterials in living systems and for enabling the vast applications of nanomedicine. Here we combined multiscale molecular dynamics simulations and complementary experiments to characterize the silver nanoparticle-ubiquitin corona formation. Notably, ubiquitins competed with citrates for the nanoparticle surface, governed by specific electrostatic interactions. Under a high protein/nanoparticle stoichiometry, ubiquitins formed a multi-layer corona on the particle surface. The binding exhibited an unusual stretched-exponential behavior, suggesting a rich binding kinetics. Furthermore, the binding destabilized the alpha-helices while increasing the beta-sheet content of the proteins. This study revealed the atomic and molecular details of the structural and dynamic characteristics of nanoparticle-protein corona formation.									32	0	0	9	0	32			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000324500900054	23921560	
B	Mehta, Parikshit; Mears, Laine			ASME					CUTTING FORCE CONTROL IN MACHINING: BAYESIAN UPDATE OF MECHANISTIC FORCE MODEL								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME 5TH ANNUAL DYNAMIC SYSTEMS AND CONTROL DIVISION CONFERENCE AND JSME 11TH MOTION AND VIBRATION CONFERENCE, DSCC 2012, VOL 3								243	251					2013	2013	For closed loop control of machining forces in the turning process, it is well established that identification of the mechanistic force model is necessary to ensure stable operation of the process. This work proposes a novel approach to update the mechanistic force model by incorporating uncertainty in the deterministic framework Force coefficient values reported in literature are based on wide spectrum of machining conditions and so cause difficulty in predicting the machining force using the mechanistic force model. This variability stems from variation in material workpiece input quality variation. This work proposes to treat force coefficient and process variables (shear stress and friction angles) as random variables and use Bayesian Statistical techniques to infer true distribution of force coefficients via observing cutting force and feed force values and updating shear stress and friction angle joint probability distribution. A numerical analysis is performed for calculating force coefficients for Titanium alloy (Ti6-Al4V) Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation is performed to sample from the posterior distribution of the force coefficient. A single update cycle shows high reduction in the variability of the force coefficient. Numerical simulations presented indicate that it is possible to implement Bayesian update scheme in a closed loop control of cutting force for online identification of force coefficients and shear stress and friction angle distributions with few required update cycles and efficiently rejects the disturbance caused by changing machining parameters.					5th Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Division Conference / 11th JSME Motion and Vibration Conference5th Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Division Conference / 11th JSME Motion and Vibration Conference	OCT 17-19, 2012OCT 17-19, 2012	ASME, DSCD; JSMEASME, DSCD; JSME	Fort Lauderdale, FLFort Lauderdale, FL	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-4531-8	WOS:000324076500031

J	Pitt, Amber L.; Nickerson, Max A.								Potential recovery of a declined turtle population diminished by a community shift towards more generalist species								AMPHIBIA-REPTILIA				34	2			193	200		10.1163/15685381-00002883			2013	2013	Models suggest that a declined turtle population may rebound if the cause of decline is remedied and adult mortality is reduced, but recovery time will likely be slow. In 2005-2007, we reexamined a river turtle community which included a population of Northern Map Turtles (Graptemys geographica) that had been reduced by approximately 50% between 1969 and 1980 likely as a result of harvesting, and had failed to rebound by 2004 despite no evidence of continued harvesting. Comparisons of population estimates for G. geographica showed no significant differences between 2005 and 2006 (z = 1.79, P = 0.073) or between 2006 and 2007 (z = 1.07, P = 0.284). However, the population estimate for 2007 was not significantly different from the population estimate for 1969 (z = 0.48, P = 0.629) but was significantly higher than the population estimate for 1980 (z = 2.96, P = 0.003), suggesting the population had returned to its predecline (1969) size. While the recovery of the G. geographica population demonstrates that a previously harvested river turtle population may rebound if no further harvesting occurs, the recovery period will be extensive, thus confirming model predictions. Furthermore, the turtle community composition was shifting towards a higher relative abundance of generalist species and a lower relative abundance of specialist species - a pattern that can be expected with habitat degradation, another threat which may present new challenges to G. geographica, a dietary specialist.									3	0	0	4	0	4			0173-5373			WOS:000323052200005

The majority of mammary gland development occurs postnatally, and the mammary gland undergoes cyclical periods of growth, differentiation, lactation, and regression that are coordinated to provide nutrients for offspring or are driven by strategies to manage reproduction and milk production of domesticated species. Growth and maintenance of the mammary epithelium depends on the function of mammary stem cells and progenitor cells. In this review, we provide an overview of postnatal mammary gland development, cyclical phases of mammary gland regression ( regression during lactation and between successive lactations), and mammary stem cells and progenitor cells. Where possible, these processes are related to animal production and compared across species, particularly bovine, porcine, murine, and human.									10	0	0	9	1	11			2165-8102		978-0-8243-0001-2	WOS:000323479900009	25387016

Conventional optical fibers, such as standard telecommunications single-mode fibers, have been successfully used in these applications, and most typically in the time domain, such as with BOTDR. Such conventional fibers however are susceptible simultaneously to both temperature and strain, requiring either at least two fibers or specialized cabling to distinguish the effects of a local stress from those of a local change in temperature. Recently, methods utilizing fibers possessing at least two Brillouin frequency shifts, each with different temperature or strain coefficients have been proposed. However, realizing such fibers is challenging, requiring fibers with regions of very different compositions, all of which must have substantial overlap with the optical field, posing significant manufacturing challenges. We present several new specialty optical fibers based on novel and unconventional fabrication techniques with significant potential for use in distributed fiber sensor systems. First, we describe a class of fibers fabricated from materials whose Brillouin frequency shifts are immune to either temperature or strain, with a demonstration of the former using fiber derived from sapphire crystal, and modeling and measurements predicting the latter. The 'Brillouin-athermal' fiber enables the measurement of a local strain, independent of the local temperature. Second, we describe and demonstrate a novel group of longitudinally-graded (chirped) fibers enabling easily-implemented frequency-domain systems; affording the potential to simplify and reduce the cost of Brillouin-based distributed sensors.

Some are passive, based on acousto-optic fiber designs that incorporate longitudinally- or radially-tailored optical and/or acoustic index profiles, leading to broadened Brillouin gain spectra (BGS) with reduced peak gain. Some are active, relying on an applied temperature or strain distribution, also resulting in broadened BGS. Broadening the laser spectrum still represents the most effective method to-date to obtain large-scale (> 20 dB) decreases in the gain, but the suitability of this method depends largely on the application and system requirements on the laser spectrum. Despite these technologies, some introduced only in the last decade, the vast majority of high-energy, narrow-linewidth fiber laser systems are still limited by SBS rather than the availability of pump power. We present an alternative approach; rather than focusing on 'suppressing' SBS in waveguide or other designs, we propose implementing materials with intrinsically low Brillouin gain. We focus on high-density, high-sound-velocity, large acoustic-damping-coefficient, and low-photoelastic-constant materials wherein the correct balancing of physical characteristics gives rise to extremely low Brillouin gain. In general, the approach requires the use of compositions that would be considered to be highly unconventional and unachievable utilizing standard fiber fabrication methods. For example, we describe recent results on sapphire-derived fibers (among other compositions) wherein a Brillouin gain nearly 20 dB lower than those of more conventional fibers has been realized. Other compositions will also be presented, including new results on a novel baria doped fiber, including others predicted to have zero-valued photoelastic constants, and therefore zero Brillouin gain.

The method is based on the idea of balancing longitudinal and lateral tire force saturation levels using a cascade model predictive structure for the optimal distribution of tractive or braking torques. Balancing saturation levels also has the added benefit of reducing and evening-out tire wear. To demonstrate the energy-loss reduction benefits, we consider nonlinear simulations of a nominally unstable truck featuring an independent drive system. Comparisons against a commonly cited brake-based yaw stability control strategy with similar directional control performance shows that the proposed predictive saturation management approach provides energy-loss reductions of more than 60%. This energy efficiency benefits are retained whether or not the drive system has regenerative/energy recovery capabilities.					5th Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Division Conference / 11th JSME Motion and Vibration Conference5th Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Division Conference / 11th JSME Motion and Vibration Conference	OCT 17-19, 2012OCT 17-19, 2012	ASME, DSCD; JSMEASME, DSCD; JSME	Fort Lauderdale, FLFort Lauderdale, FL	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-4529-5	WOS:000323918100102

In order to construct the coarse-grained PPTA model (specifically, in order to define the nature of the coarse-grained particles/beads and to parameterize various components of the bead/bead force-field functions), the results of an all-atom molecular-level computational investigation are used. In addition, the microstructure/topology of the fiber core, consisting of a number of coaxial crystalline fibrils, is taken into account. Also, following our prior work, various PPTA crystallographic/topological defects are introduced into the model (at concentrations consistent with the prototypical PPTA synthesis/processing conditions). The analysis carried out clearly revealed (a) formation of the kink bands during axial compression; (b) the role of defects in promoting the formation of kink bands; (c) the stimulating effects of some defects on the fiber-fibrillation process; and (d) the detrimental effect of the prior compression, associated with fiber fibrillation, on the residual longitudinal-tensile strength of the PPTA fibers.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1687-8434			WOS:000323967100001

The control structure avoids the need for an explicit reference model to generate target responses.

The dynamic performance is measured by also considering the impact the integration of new technologies such as distributed generation (DG) and hybrid distributed generation (HDG) have on the grid. Hybrid distributed generation with one or more renewable (stochastic) energy sources interact with the existing grid during import and export of power generation. This interaction contributes more fault current therefore making the system vulnerable to instability more than a single energy source. This study investigates the dynamic impact of hybrid Wind/ PV/small Hydro power on transient stability. To investigate this impact, a detail modeling of grid connected wind / solar PV and small hydropower system with single machine infinite system is carried out. The simulation was done in DIgSILENT power factory software. The configuration of the proposed typical grid connected hybrid distributed generation (HDG) consists of variable speed Wind turbine with doubly -fed induction generator (DFIG), solar PV and small hydropower system. The wind turbine is integrated through PWM converter into the existing Grid while the solar PV incorporated into the system consists of DC sources integrated through PWM inverter and the hydro power is directly connected through a synchronous generator.

This study aims to print a tube structure using a laser-assisted orifice-free printing technique and further investigate the effect of sodium alginate concentration on the tube wall thickness. Alginate tubes have been successfully printed. It is found that highly viscous materials can be laser printed into well-defined tube structures. A higher concentration solution such as the 8% sodium alginate solution leads to a thin wall, meaning a better resolution. Imaging analysis also illustrates that higher concentration solutions help develop smooth, slim jets upon the incidence of laser pulse.

B	Henderson, Andrew; Bunget, Cristina; Kurfess, Thomas			ASME					INTEGRATION OF ON-MACHINE MEASUREMENTS IN THE FORCE MODELING FOR MACHINING OF ADVANCED NICKEL-BASED SUPERALLOYS								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME/ISCIE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON FLEXIBLE AUTOMATION, ISFA 2012								561	567					2013	2013	Nickel-based superalloys are specially designed for applications where high strength, creep resistance, and oxidation resistance are critical at high temperatures. Many of their applications are the hot gas sections of turbo-machinery (e.g. jet engines and gas turbines). With greater demands on the performance and efficiency of these types of machines, the firing temperatures are reaching higher levels and nickel-based superalloys are being utilized more because of their excellent mechanical qualities at extreme temperatures. However, the properties that make them attractive for these applications present difficult challenges for the manufacture, particularly machining, of the components that are made from these materials. Considering the extreme environment that these components operate in, part quality, in particular surface quality, is paramount. The damage and stresses introduced to the surfaces of these components during manufacture needs to be well understood and controlled in order to ensure that premature component and machine failures do not occur. With improved process models and on-machine measurement capabilities, the in-process cutting forces and temperatures can be better understood and therefore subsurface damage can be better controlled. Since cutting forces and temperatures are direct contributors to subsurface damage, better control of these aspects would then lead to better control of subsurface damage.

Poovarodom, S; Yingjajaval, S		Prunus Rootstocks Influence Peach Leaf and Fruit Nutrient Content								VII INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON MINERAL NUTRITION OF FRUIT CROPS		Acta Horticulturae		984				117	124					2013	2013	Prunus interspecific hybrids and plum species have replaced P. persica as the preferred rootstock for peach in Europe and some regions of North America. However, compatibility and nutrient uptake have not been assessed with many peach cultivars. 'Redhaven' peach was grafted to a total of 24 rootstocks represented in 2 replicated trials near Clemson, South Carolina. These trials were planted in 2006 and 2009 on a Cecil gravelly, sandy loam with a pH of 5.0 (no pre-plant lime) and 6.4 (pre-plant limed), respectively. The rootstock cultivars included 9 interspecific Prunus hybrids and 3 non-peach Prunus species. Leaf and fruit nutrient analyses were done on mature leaves (>100/tree) and ripe fruit (4/tree) collected in June 2011. Highly significant differences among rootstocks were found for scion leaf nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), sulfur (S) and sodium (Na). There were no significant differences due to rootstock for leaf copper (Cu) and iron (Fe). Only leaf Zn and Cu concentrations from trees on several rootstocks were below the minimum recommended. Highly significant differences among rootstocks for fruit flesh nutrients were found for P, Mn and S. Lesser differences occurred for K and Mg. Ca and Cu levels in the fruit of all rootstock combinations were below what has been reported in the literature for 'Redhaven'. Annual soil K may have competed with root uptake of Ca and a spray program lacking foliar Cu applications may have indirectly affected Cu levels in the fruit. Differences in mineral uptake between specific rootstock cultivars and rootstock species were observed in this study and may be indicators of efficiency for absorbing and transporting nutrients to peach scion cultivars.					7th International Symposium on Mineral Nutrition of Fruit Crops7th International Symposium on Mineral Nutrition of Fruit Crops	MAY 19-25, 2012MAY 19-25, 2012	Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)	Chanthaburi, THAILANDChanthaburi, THAILAND	1	0	0	0	1	1			0567-7572		978-90-66052-99-4	WOS:000323639300010

Evans, KM; Lata, B; Kellerhals, M		Development of a Genetic Linkage Map for Identification of Molecular Markers Associated with Resistance to Bacterial Spot (Xanthomonas arboricola pv. pruni) in Peach								XIII EUCARPIA SYMPOSIUM ON FRUIT BREEDING AND GENETICS		Acta Horticulturae		976				561	566					2013	2013	Bacterial spot, caused by Xanthomonas arboricola pv. pruni, is a serious disease that can affect peach fruit quality and production worldwide. This disease causes severe defoliation and blemishing of fruit, particularly in areas with high rainfall, strong winds, high humidity and sandy soil. The molecular basis of its tolerance and susceptibility in peach is yet to be understood. To study the genetics of the peach in response to bacterial spot, an F-2 segregating population between two peach cultivars, 'Clayton', a resistant phenotype, and 'O'Henry', which is very susceptible to bacterial spot, was created. Phenotypic data for leaf and fruit response to bacterial spot infection were collected at two locations: the Sandhills Research Station, Jackson Springs, North Carolina (NC); the Sandhill Research and Education Center, Pontiac, South Carolina (SC). Out of 574 SSR markers developed in Prunus, only 7% (38) were informative among parents and used to develop a framework genetic linkage map. Markers based on the NBS-LRR (nucleotide binding site, leucine-rich repeat) resistance gene analogs were developed to increase the map density. Single marker analysis indicates several interesting markers highly associated (P<0.001) with the bacterial spot resistance trait. Kruskal-Wallis and Simple Interval Mapping revealed one putative QTL associated with low incidence of bacterial spot located on LG4. Marker-assisted selection for bacterial spot resistance will be discussed.					13th Eucarpia Symposium on Fruit Breeding and Genetics13th Eucarpia Symposium on Fruit Breeding and Genetics	SEP 11-15, 2011SEP 11-15, 2011	Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)	Warsaw, POLANDWarsaw, POLAND	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-90-66051-19-5	WOS:000323823900080

The field of biomimesis has spawned many new materials and continues to be a fruitful field of investigation. This chapter presents the current state of bioinspiration in textiles, how this has resulted in improved fibrous materials, how it may inform our continued progress. Because I have found many preconceived notions about the field that need addressing before the application of biomimetics to textiles can be truly appreciated, I begin with an introduction to textiles. Next, naturally enough, the discipline of biomimesis is introduced and then fleshed out in terms of its textile engineering importance. Following this, some details on fiber and textile science and engineering are discussed and biological concepts germane to our topic are presented. In the last step in this journey, the marriage of biomimesis and textiles is performed and some consequences revealed. Finally, I offer some prognostications on the topic.									1	0	0	0	0	1					978-0-12-391432-3; 978-0-12-415995-2	WOS:000322241100013

Like Alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV), bromoviruses, and cucumoviruses they are isometric viruses and possess a single-stranded, tripartite RNA genome. However, unlike these other three groups, ilarviruses were recognized as being recalcitrant subjects for research (their ready lability is reflected in the sigla used to create the group name) and were renowned as unpromising subjects for the production of antisera. However, it was recognized that they shared properties with AMV when the phenomenon of genome activation, in which the coat protein (CP) of the virus is required to be present to initiate infection, was demonstrated to cross group boundaries. The CP of AMV could activate the genome of an ilarvirus and vice versa. Development of the molecular information for ilarviruses lagged behind the knowledge available for the more extensively studied AMV, bromoviruses, and cucumoviruses. In the past 20 years, genomic data for most known ilarviruses have been developed facilitating their detection and allowing the factors involved in the molecular biology of the genus to be investigated. Much information has been obtained using Prunus necrotic ringspot virus and the more extensively studied AMV. A relationship between some ilarviruses and the cucumoviruses has been defined with the recognition that members of both genera encode a 2b protein involved in RNA silencing and long distance viral movement. Here, we present a review of the current knowledge of both the taxonomy and the molecular biology of this genus of agronomically and horticulturally important viruses.									10	0	0	8	1	10			0065-3527		978-0-12-407698-3	WOS:000322845900005	23809923

The most significant low-order harmonics to be compensated are calculated using a multiple reference frame harmonic observer. This method of measuring and compensating harmonics is accurate straightforward, easily implementable and effective in the mitigation of any harmonic in the system. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of this proposed method. These results validate the effectiveness of the method in compensating the targeted harmonics in the system. The currents obtained in the fundamental reference frame can be further employed for control of active and reactive power flow.

Two different matrices (SELM-1 selenium-enriched yeast certified reference material and synthetic urine) were analyzed for the content of methionine and selenium species utilizing this analytical tool. An ion-paring reversed-phase chromatographic separation using a linear gradient of water and methanol (each containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid), at 0.9 mL min(-1) with an analysis time of less than 20 minute, was employed for the selenium speciation. Electron ionization mass spectra yielded clear and simple fragmentation patterns of the chemical species eluting from the chromatographic column. Quantification by a standard addition method was accomplished for methionine (m/z = 149 Da) and selenomethionine (m/z = 196 Da) with recoveries of 93% (9% RSD, n = 4) and 97% (11% RSD, n = 4), respectively. Absolute limits of detection on the nanogram level were obtained for each of the targeted species.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1759-9660			WOS:000323226800041

Strong magnetic fields generated in the trailing shock contribute to the electrons transverse deflection and acceleration. We have calculated, self-consistently, the radiation from electrons accelerated in these turbulent magnetic fields. We found that the synthetic spectra depend on the bulk Lorentz factor of the jet, its temperature and strength of the generated magnetic fields. We have also investigated accelerated electrons in strong magnetic fields generated by kinetic shear (Kelvin-Helmholtz) instabilities. The calculated properties of the emerging radiation will guide our understanding of the complex time evolution and/or spectral structure in gamma-ray bursts, relativistic jets in general, and supernova remnants.

Protein triggered fluorescence switching of near-infrared emitting nanoparticles for contrast-enhanced imaging								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B				1	36			4542	4554		10.1039/c3tb20681e			2013	2013	Sub-100 nm colloidal particles which are surface-functionalized with multiple environmentally-sensitive moieties have the potential to combine imaging, early detection, and the treatment of cancer with a single type of long-circulating "nanodevice". Deep tissue imaging is achievable through the development of particles which are surface-modified with fluorophores that operate in the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum and where the fluorophore's signal can be maximized by "turning-on" the fluorescence only in the targeted tissue. We present a general approach for the synthesis of NIR emitting nanoparticles that exhibit a protein triggered activation/deactivation of the emission. Dispersing the particles into an aqueous solution, such as phosphate buffered saline (PBS), resulted in an aggregation of the hydrophobic fluorophores and a cessation of emission. The emission can be reinstated, or activated, by the conversion of the surface-attached fluorophores from an aggregate to a monomeric species with the addition of an albumin. This activated probe can be deactivated and returned to a quenched state by a simple tryptic digestion of the albumin. The methodology for emission switching offers a path to maximize the signal from the typically weak quantum yield inherent in NIR fluorophores.									6	0	0	1	0	6			2050-750X			WOS:000323484100002

The neurons we obtained from these two cell types have no difference in morphology as observed under a high-magnification microscope. However, when flowing in the microfluidic channel and simultaneously being laser-guided, the two cell types gained quite different guidance velocities under the same experimental conditions. The experimental results demonstrate that different cell types with the same morphology (e.g., size, shape, etc.) can be effectively distinguished from each other by measuring the difference of guidance velocities (the maximum flow velocities minus the initial flow velocities). This technique is expected to provide a new approach to high-throughput, label-free cell sorting with sensitivity.

A striking chromic transformation from deep blue to bright red, accompanied by a characteristic change in the Raman spectra of the PDAs occurs as a result of environmental stresses, such as heating, mechanical shear, exposure to solvents and other agents. Modification of the pendant groups of the PDA can expand the triggering stresses to include toxins, bacteria and other chemical and biological entities. Mechanical impact sensors and thermal and environmental history recorders have been prepared. The potential application of the polymer blends as photolithographic receptors has also been explored.

Collective alignment of nanorods in thin Newtonian films								SOFT MATTER				9	35			8532	8539		10.1039/c3sm51467f			2013	2013	In this paper, we provide a complete analytical description of the alignment kinetics of magnetic nanorods in magnetic field. Nickel nanorods were formed by template electrochemical deposition in alumina membranes from a dispersion in a water-glycerol mixture. To ensure uniformity of the dispersion, the surface of the nickel nanorods was covered with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). A 40-70 nm coating prevented aggregation of the nanorods. These modifications allowed us to control alignment of the nanorods in a magnetic field and test the proposed theory. An orientational distribution function of nanorods was introduced. We demonstrated that the 0.04% volume fraction of nanorods in the glycerol-water mixture behaves as a system of non-interacting particles. However, the kinetics of alignment of a nanorod assembly does not follow the predictions of the single-nanorod theory. The distribution function theory explains the kinetics of alignment of a nanorod assembly and shows the significance of the initial distribution of nanorods in the film. It can be used to develop an experimental protocol for controlled ordering of magnetic nanorods in thin films.									10	1	0	1	0	10			1744-683X			WOS:000323269400015

Self-healing polymeric materials								CHEMICAL SOCIETY REVIEWS				42	17			7446	7467		10.1039/c3cs60109a			2013	2013	Inspired by nature, self-healing materials represent the forefront of recent developments in materials chemistry and engineering. This review outlines the recent advances in the field of self-healing polymers. The first part discusses thermodynamic requirements for self-healing networks in the context of conformation changes that contribute to the Gibbs free energy. The chain flexibility significantly contributes to the entropy changes, whereas the heat of reaction and the external energy input are the main contributors to enthalpy changes. The second part focuses on chemical reactions that lead to self-healing, and the primary classes are the covalent bonding, supramolecular assemblies, ionic interactions, chemo-mechanical self-healing, and shape memory polymers. The third part outlines recent advances using encapsulation, remote self-healing and the role of shape memory polymers. Recent developments in the field of self-healing polymers undeniably indicate that the main challenge will be the designing of high glass transition (T-g) functional materials, which also exhibit stimuli-responsive attributes. Build-in controllable hierarchical heterogeneousness at various length scales capable of remote self- healing by physical and chemical responses will be essential in designing future materials of the 21st century.									158	5	0	16	0	159			0306-0012	1460-4744		WOS:000322782700023	23864042

Currently, clinical diagnosis and determination of disease extent relies primarily on subjective assessment of pain, range of motion, and possibly X-ray or ultrasound images. The final treatment plan however is at the discretion of the clinician, who often bases their decision on personal experiences, and not quantitative standards.The use of ultrasound for the assessment of tissue biomechanics is established, such as in ultrasound elastography, where soft tissue biomechanics are measured. Few studies have investigated the use of ultrasound elastography in the characterization of musculoskeletal biomechanics. To assess tissue biomechanics we have developed a device, which measures the force applied to the underlying musculotendentious tissue while simultaneously obtaining the related ultrasound images. In this work, the musculotendinous region of the infraspinatus of twenty asymptomatic male organized baseball players was examined to access the variability in tissue properties with in a single patient and across a normal population. Elastic moduli at percent strains less than 15 were significantly different than those above 15 percent strain within the normal population. No significant difference in tissue properties was demonstrated within a single patient. This analysis demonstrated elastic moduli are variable across individuals and incidence. Therefore threshold elastic moduli will likely be a function of variation in local-tissue moduli as opposed to a specific global value.

Important questions arise as to how this long-range transport degrades in amorphous condensed solids which are most amenable to low-cost optoelectronic devices and how fast energy transfer could occur. Here, we address these in disordered, densely packed nanoparticles made from green-light-harvesting host polymers (PFBT) and deep-red-emitting dopant polymers (PF-DBT5). By femtosecond selective excitation of donor (BT) units, we study in detail the internal structure-mediated energy transfer to uniformly distributed, seldom acceptor (DBT) units. It has been unambiguously demonstrated that the creation of interchain species is responsible for the limitation of bulk exciton diffusion length in polymer materials. This interchain Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) becomes a preferred and dominant channel, and near 100% energy transfer efficiency could be achieved at high acceptor concentrations (>10 wt%). Side-chain carboxylic acid groups in functionalized polymer-blend dots slightly slow down the FRET rate, but it could not affect the Forster radius and FRET efficiency. These findings imply that a greater understanding of the role of interchain species could be an efficient approach to improve the cell efficiency.									8	2	0	0	0	9			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000322315600021	23817864

Using the open aperture Z-scan method in tandem with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Raman spectroscopy, we demonstrate the simultaneous tailoring of both electronic and NLO properties of SWCNTs, from ultrafast (femtosecond) to relatively slow (nanosecond) timescales, by doping with a single substituent, viz., boron. SWCNTs were doped via a wet chemical method using B2O3, and the boron content and bonding configurations were identified using XPS. While in the ns excitation regime, the nonlinear absorption was found to increase with increasing boron concentration in the SWCNTs (due to the increasing disorder and enhanced metallicity of the SWCNTs), the saturation intensity in the fs excitation regime decreased. We attribute this counter-intuitive behavior to excited state absorption on ns timescales, and saturable absorption combined with weak two-photon transitions on fs timescales between van Hove singularities.									13	0	0	1	0	13			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000322315600022	23817830

Effective cancer-targeting therapies will require both passive- and active-targeting strategies and a thorough understanding of physiologic barriers to targeted drug delivery. Designing a targeted therapy includes the selection and optimization of a nanoparticle delivery vehicle for passive accumulation in tumors, a targeting moiety for active receptor-mediated uptake, and stimuli-responsive polymers for control of drug release. The future direction of cancer targeting is a combinatorial approach, in which targeting therapies are designed to use multiple-targeting strategies. The combinatorial approach will enable combination therapy for delivery of multiple drugs and dual ligand targeting to improve targeting specificity. Targeted cancer treatments in development and the new combinatorial approaches show promise for improving targeted anticancer drug delivery and improving treatment outcomes.									18	0	0	11	0	18			0065-230X		978-0-12-407173-5	WOS:000321874400001	23768509

In this study, we used a qualitative approach to analyzing classroom discourse derived from Toulmin's model of argumentation in order to describe the ways in which students develop particulate-level justifications for claims about thermodynamic properties. Our analysis extends the construct of sociomathematical norms to a chemistry context in order to describe disciplinary criteria for reasoning and justification, which we refer to as sociochemical norms. By examining how whole class and small group discussions shape norms related to reasoning, we provide suggestions for teaching practices in inquiry-oriented settings.									16	0	0	0	0	16			1109-4028			WOS:000322017200008

Historically, ASDs were treated with open heart surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass, allowing a patch to be sewn over the defect. In 1976, King et al. demonstrated use of a transcatheter occlusion procedure, thus reducing the invasiveness of ASD repair. Localization during these catheter based procedures traditionally has relied on bi-plane fluoroscopy; more recently trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE) and intra-cardiac echocardiography (ICE) have been used to navigate these procedures. Although there is a high success rate using the transcatheter occlusion procedure, fluoroscopy poses radiation dose risk to both patient and clinician. The impact of this dose to the patients is important as many of those undergoing this procedure are children, who have an increased risk associated with radiation exposure. Their longer life expectancy than adults provides a larger window of opportunity for expressing the damaging effects of ionizing radiation. In addition, epidemiologic studies of exposed populations have demonstrated that children are considerably more sensitive to the carcinogenic effects radiation.Image-guided surgery (IGS) uses pre-operative and intra-operative images to guide surgery or an interventional procedure. Central to every IGS system is a software application capable of processing and displaying patient images, registration between multiple coordinate systems, and interfacing with a tool tracking system. We have developed a novel image-guided surgery framework called Kit for Navigation by Image Focused Exploration (KNIFE). In this work we assess the efficacy of this image-guided navigation system for ASD repair using a series of mock clinical experiments designed to simulate ASD repair device deployment.

The near-infrared (1.5 mu m) emission properties were evaluated as a function of Er3+ concentration. Judd-Ofelt intensity parameters, radiative rates, branching ratios, and emission lifetimes were calculated and compared with results reported for Er3+ doped Y2O3 single crystal and nanocrystals. Following pumping at 1.532 mu m, weak blue (similar to 0.41 mu m, H-2(9/2) -> I-4(15/2)), strong green (similar to 0.56 mu m, H-2(11/2), S-4(3/2) -> I-4(15/2)) and red (similar to 0.67 mu m, F-4(9/2) -> I-4(15/2)) emission bands were observed as well as weak near-infrared emissions at 0.8 mu m (I-4(9/2) -> I-4(15/2)) and 0.85 mu m (S-4(3/2) -> I-4(13/2)) at room temperature. The upconversion emission properties under similar to 1.5 mu m pumping were further investigated through pump power dependence and decay time studies. Sequential two-photon absorption leads to the I-4(9/2) upconversion emission while energy transfer upconversion is responsible for the emission from the higher excited states H-2(9/2), H-2(11/2), S-4(3/2), and F-4(9/2). The enhanced red emission with increasing Er3+ concentration most likely occurred via the cross-relaxation process between (F-4(7/2) -> F-4(9/2)) and (I-4(11/2) -> F-4(9/2)) transitions, which increased the population of the F-4(9/2) level.

Sub-wavelength grating based resonant optical filters are introduced and their application in 2 mu m thulium fiber laser and amplifier systems has been discussed. The paper focuses on applying such filtering techniques to 2.8 mu m mid-IR fiber laser systems. A narrowband mid-IR Guided-Mode Resonance Filter (GMRF) was designed and fabricated using Hafnium(IV) Oxide film/quartz wafer material system. The fabricated GMRF was then integrated into an Erbium (Er)-doped Zr-Ba-La-Al-Na (ZBLAN) fluoride glass fiber laser as a wavelength selective feedback element. The laser operated at 2782 nm with a linewidth less than 2 nm demonstrating the viability of GMRF's for wavelength selection in the mid-IR. Furthermore, a GMRF of narrower linewidth based on Aluminum Oxide/quartz wafer material system is fabricated and tested in the same setup. The potentials and challenges with GMRFs will be discussed and summarized.

S	Walker, Ian D.			IEEE					Robot Strings: Long, Thin Continuum Robots								2013 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE		IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings												2013	2013	We describe and discuss the development of long, thin, continuous "string-like" robots aimed at Space exploration missions. These continuous backbone "continuum" robots are inspired by numerous biological structures, particularly vines, worms, and the tongues of animals such as the anteater. The key novelty is the high length-to-diameter ratio of the robots. This morphology offers penetration into, and exploration of, significantly narrower and deeper environments than accessible using current robot technology. In this paper, we introduce new design alternatives for long thin continuum robots, based on an analysis and extension of three core existing continuum robot design types. The designs are evaluated based on their mechanical feasibility, structural properties, kinematic simplicity, and degrees of freedom.

J	Grover, Varun								Muddling Along to Moving Beyond in IS Research: Getting from Good to Great								JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS				14	5	SI		274	282					2013	2013	In this article, I argue that the IS field seems to be doing well when evaluated with sociometric techniques. However, while the progress of our field is commendable, we might have reached diminishing returns in the way we conduct research with our current modus operandi. Given that we are dealing with the most important phenomena of our time, I believe that it is time to become more ambitious and expand our impact to other domains and disciplines by creating more enduring and impactful research. I argue that four key dimensions on which we should place emphasis include: our institutionalization of a certain genre of research, monistic theorizing of our phenomena, the focus on questions for which data is easier to access, and our unwillingness to deeply engage with reference discipline theories. Addressing these through individual and collective efforts can help us expand the frontiers of our knowledge product and create broader value.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1536-9323			WOS:000321819700004

The polarizable water and ion models are based only on the classical Drude oscillators. The temperature dependence of the surface tension of water is examined for different water models. The dependence of salt densities on salt concentration is investigated through the nonpolarizable and Drude oscillator polarizable models. Finally, the reproduction of the surface tension of salt solution over a large range of concentrations is analyzed through a number of combinations between ions and water force fields. The structure of the interface is then discussed as a function of polarization effects. We establish here the inability of the Drude oscillator polarizable force fields to reproduce the salt concentration dependence of surface tension of NaCl aqueous solutions.									12	0	0	1	0	12			1463-9076			WOS:000321201500012	23752676

To this end, bilayer graphene films are synthesized using CVD method and substitutionally doped with Nitrogen (N). Previously, XPS measurements done in tandem with Raman spectroscopy revealed that the rich chemistry between carbon and nitrogen can result in pyridinic, pyrrolic, or graphitic configurations. The nonlinear optical properties (NLO) of both pristine and N-doped graphene samples are studied in both nanosecond and femtosecond excitation regimes using open aperture Z-scan method. Similar to the previous observations with Raman spectroscopy, we see that the NLO properties are more sensitive to the local bonding environments which determine the defect density in the graphene lattice, rather than just the dopant percentage. Our results give more insights into the effect of defects on the NLO properties of doped graphene which help in tailor making graphene samples for applications like modelocking and optical switching.

Rewriting the problem in cylindrical coordinates reduces the three-dimensional problem to a problem in two dimensions. This reduction to two dimensions requires the numerical analysis to be studied in suitably weighted Hilbert spaces. In this setting the Raviart-Thomas (RT) and Brezzi-Douglas-Marini (BDM) approximation pairs are shown to be LBB stable and corresponding a priori error estimates are derived. Presented numerical experiments confirm the predicted rates of convergence for the RT and BDM approximations.									4	2	0	0	0	6			0036-1429			WOS:000321043900003

Results: Parents exhibiting a laissez-faire parenting style reported lower levels of family nutrition and physical activity. In addition, parent BMI moderated the relationship be-tween laissez-faire parenting and these health behaviors. Conclusions: This study indicates that family-oriented nutrition and physical activity programs may benefit from including a focus on decreasing laissez-faire parenting, as well as helping overweight parents reduce their BMIs.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1945-7359			WOS:000321215200004	23985227

The paper seeks to identify their competitive priorities based on their recent developments and their anticipated opportunities and challenges.Design/methodology/approach - This is an exploratory study based on semi-structured telephone interviews. The interview guide contained around 30, mainly open-ended questions.Findings - The research both confirms and refutes previous research. It refutes the "traditional view" that small firms are driven by cost, quality, flexibility and delivery only; it supports recent research which has argued that there has been a shift in terms of what competitive priorities are being pursued. More specifically, irmovativeness was identified as an important new competitive priority, but there was little evidence in support of other recently proposed priorities like security and sustainability.Research limitations/implications - This study is restricted to one area of Brazil (Sao Carlos). Further research is therefore necessary to confirm the relevance of the findings to other small firms in other regions, e.g. through a large-scale survey.Originality/value - Much of the available literature focuses on large firms in developed economies, and it assumes operations strategy is built on four "traditional" broad competitive priorities. This study provides insight into the state of small manufacturers in an emerging economy. It identifies innovativeness as a fifth key priority and argues that firms must compete on a blend of outcomes; this adds to the complexity of managerial tasks.									5	0	0	1	0	5			0263-5577			WOS:000320902800005

Seasonal Prevalence of Hematodinium sp Infections of Blue Crabs in Three South Carolina (USA) Rivers								ESTUARIES AND COASTS				36	1			174	191		10.1007/s12237-012-9556-1			JAN 2013	2013	Blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, commercial landings in the USA have been declining at an alarming rate. In South Carolina, these declines are significantly correlated with years of decreased rainfall and elevated salt marsh salinity. Previous studies suggest that higher salinity increases the risk of infection by Hematodinium sp., a dinoflagellate parasite of blue crabs, C. sapidus. A 4-year survey (June 2008 to March 2012) of blue crabs in the ACE Basin National Estuarine Research Reserve documented (1) the temporal and spatial patterns of Hematodinium sp. infection in relation to salinity, (2) some environmental correlates of disease prevalence, and (3) the characteristics of infected blue crabs. Sampling was conducted four times a year in March, June, September, and December in the South Edisto, Ashepoo, and Combahee rivers beginning in June 2008. Crab hemolymph samples were collected and preserved and DNA was successfully amplified for 2,303 individuals. Hematodinium sp. infection was evaluated by PCR amplification of its 18S rRNA gene and adjacent regions. Prevalence was highest in December 2008 in the Combahee River at sites closest to St. Helena Sound. The spatial and temporal pattern of Hematodinium sp. infection was correlated with several environmental parameters. Infected crabs exhibited differences in carapace shape and body condition compared to uninfected crabs. Overall, these results suggest that blue crabs in regions of higher salinity are at greater risk of infection by Hematodinium sp. and infected individuals exhibit sub-lethal effects of the disease.									4	0	0	3	0	4			1559-2723			WOS:000312717400014

Parametric variables affecting the efficiency of protein extractions from buffer (Tris-HCl) and urine media using a capillary-channeled polymer (C-CP) fiber stationary phase in a tip-based format are evaluated. Proteins are immobilized on to polypropylene (PP) C-CP fibers and eluted in organic solvents conducive to high analytical performance using a simple benchtop centrifuge to drive the fluids. Experimental variables, including elution solvent strength, aqueous wash volume, the interactive aspects of fiber tip length (2.5-10 mm), and loading and elution volumes, were evaluated to gain insights into fundamental processes and to optimize protein recoveries/analytical signals. Based on the MALDI-MS responses of the test proteins cytochrome c, lysozyme, and myoglobin, the optimized elution solvent was determined to be a 60 : 40 ACN-H2O mixture with 0.07% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). It was determined that different aqueous wash volumes were required to flush test solution remnants, depending on the buffer concentration, concluding that a 100 mu L wash was effective at concentrations of up to 1 M. Fiber tip length was explored to determine the limits of loading volume/protein mass for each bed size while efficiently extracting from the buffer environment. Interestingly, the shortest C-CP fiber tips provided the best efficiency, isolating nanogram levels of protein from 1 mu L aliquots of sample. After optimization, a proof of practice experiment was performed to extract the three-protein suite (<5 mu M of each) from a synthetic urine matrix. The previously undetected proteins could be readily distinguished with high spectral clarity due to the SPE procedure utilizing C-CP fiber packed micropipette tips.									3	0	0	2	0	3			1759-9660			WOS:000320331200005

Heating was applied by a rapid media exchange with heated Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) in a temperature-controlled water bath. Cell viability was determined by MTS assay. Survival data was modelled by the Arrhenius model, and the thermal isoeffective dose (TID) model where kinetic parameters were determined via non-linear optimisation.Results: Results suggest that the thermal dose based on cumulative equivalent minutes and parameters as used for hyperthermia exposures (<43 degrees C) is not applicable for ablative exposures. We found R = 0.72 for temperatures between 45-60 degrees C for the TID model. The Arrhenius parameters were frequency factor A = 3.25E43 1/s, and activation energy E-a = 281 kJ/mol. These parameters correlate well with a prior study in the same cell line, and with threshold temperatures for necrosis from in vivo studies.Conclusions: Our results suggest that standard TID model kinetic parameters based on hyperthermia studies, often also used at ablation temperatures, are not applicable at these higher temperatures for HCC cells.									8	0	0	4	0	8			0265-6736			WOS:000319939600006	23738699

Color- and shape-tunable colloidal nanoparticles capable of nanopatterning								RSC ADVANCES				3	24			9357	9364		10.1039/c3ra40805a			2013	2013	Color- and shape-tunable nanoparticles consisting of phase-separated copolymers within each particle were synthesized using emulsion copolymerization synthesis. Each particle consists of two phases: (1) poly(methyl methacrylate/n-butylacrylate) (p(MMA/nBA)) phase, which is responsible for a particle shape control, and (2) poly(n-butylacrylate/pentafluorostyrene/N,N-dimethyl aminoazoaniline methacrylate) (p(nBA/PFS/DMAAZOAMm)) phase, facilitating tunable color changes and fluorescence emission induced by acidic/basic environments. Since these particles are capable of coalescence, these studies also show simple nano-deposition process will result in similar to 200-300 nm width nanowires with "polka-dot" morphologies, offering many diversified applications ranging from high-resolution inexpensive display technologies to nano-sensing devices, or multi-drug and multi-transient delivery systems.									3	0	0	0	0	3			2046-2069			WOS:000319524100040

Evaluation of fatty acid methyl ester profile and amplified fragment length polymorphism analyses to distinguish five species of Phytophthora associated with ornamental plants								Archives of Phytopathology and Plant Protection				46	3			295	311		10.1080/03235408.2012.740312			2013	2013	Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profiles and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) were evaluated as tools for identifying species of Phytophthora. Five isolates of each of Phytophthora cactorum, Phytophthora citrophthora, Phytophthora cinnamomi, Phytophthora nicotianae and Phytophthora cryptogea were subjected to both analyses to examine variation among and within species. In FAME analysis, isolates of P. cactorum, P. cinnamomi and P. nicotianae were clustered by species, but isolates of P. citrophthora and P. cryptogea were divided into multiple clusters based on greater variations within these two species. The AFLP analysis differentiated all five species of Phytophthora. The five isolates of each species were grouped in a separate terminal cluster, but diversity within a species cluster varied considerably with variation greater in P. cryptogea and P. citrophthora. Comparing the dendrograms based on FAME and AFLP analyses, the overall patterns of both were similar. The P. cactorum cluster was distinct from clusters of the other four species, which formed one large cluster. The higher values of percentages of polymorphic loci and gene diversity in AFLP analysis substantiated diversity observed among isolates of P. citrophthora and P. cryptogea in FAME and AFLP dendrograms. Both FAME and AFLP appear to be useful tools for identifying species of Phytophthora, but only AFLP analysis has potential to study genetic and phylogenetic relationships within and among species in this genus.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0323-5408	1477-2906		BCI:BCI201300430356		
B	Martin, Jim; Fu, Yunhui; Wourms, Nicholas; Shaw, Terry			IEEE					Characterizing Netflix Bandwidth Consumption								2013 IEEE CONSUMER COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING CONFERENCE (CCNC)								230	235					2013	2013	The widespread deployment and adoption of the Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) standard is making Internet video-on-demand a 'standard' Internet application similar in impact as email and web browsing. While video streaming has been widely deployed and studied for decades, DASH-based streaming is very different as it involves adaptation both by the application and by TCP. The dynamics and implications of multiple levels of end-to-end congestion control are not well understood. The contribution of the research presented in this paper is twofold: first, we characterize the bandwidth consumption of a widely deployed DASH application (i.e., Netflix); second, we provide insight in how different implementations and different access networks can impact bandwidth consumption. Our results suggest that Netflix adaptation defaults to underlying TCP mechanisms during periods of heavy, sustained network congestion. However, the application algorithm is clearly intertwined with the underlying TCP mechanisms during periods of volatile network conditions. In one network scenario, we observed that a backlogged TCP flow achieved a throughput of 6 Mbps while a Netflix session (under similar path conditions) consumed less than 3 Mbps of bandwidth.					10th IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference (CCNC)10th IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference (CCNC)	JAN 11-14, 2013JAN 11-14, 2013	IEEEIEEE	Las Vegas, NVLas Vegas, NV	5	0	0	0	0	5					978-1-4673-3133-3; 978-1-4673-4735-8	WOS:000318943600034

Ahuja, S; Hristovski, K		Functionalized Nanoparticles as Removable Membrane Coatings								NOVEL SOLUTIONS TO WATER POLLUTION		ACS Symposium Series		1123				189	203					2013	2013	Membrane fouling plagues all types of membrane filtration, from large-pore microfiltration to nonporous reverse osmosis (RO). Here we investigate the feasibility of using a coating of one or two layers that serves as a barrier between the membrane and foulant. This coating is electrostatically bound to the membrane at operational pH and removed with a simple pH adjustment once fouling has reduced operational efficiency. The water treatment polymer polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (polyDADMAC) was used to create a positive charge on the fully aromatic polyamide membrane surface. Carboxy-functionalized polyacrylate nanoparticles (NPs) composite with either silver [Ag-PA(-)] or titanium dioxide [TiO2-PA(-), both approximately 10 nm in size, were then adsorbed onto the polyDADMAC coating to reinstate an overall negative charge to the membrane surface. Acid washing removed the polyDADMAC coating by protonating the carboxyl groups on the membrane, promoting repulsion from the membrane surface. Coating and removal phases were characterized primarily by measurement of the surface zeta potential with an electrokinetic analyzer. Additional characterization was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. The overall results serve as a proof of concept that these materials could serve as removable coatings for RO membranes.

Typical simulations with Leray-alpha can oversmooth solutions, and our algorithm is proposed to help avoid this potential drawback. We prove the proposed scheme is unconditionally stable and optimally convergent, with choice of element order and fine mesh width guided by the analysis. A complete and rigorous numerical analysis of the scheme is given, along with experiments that demonstrate its effectiveness.					8th International Conference on Scientific Computing and Applications8th International Conference on Scientific Computing and Applications	APR 01-04, 2012APR 01-04, 2012	UNLV, Dept Math SciUNLV, Dept Math Sci	Univ Nevada, Las Vegas, NVUniv Nevada, Las Vegas, NV	0	0	0	0	0	0			0271-4132		978-0-8218-8737-0	WOS:000319240200009

More precisely, it is a case study on the relationship among these factors, gleaned from surveys conducted in 2010 and 2012 of Chilean college students and faculty. This survey is part of an overall multiyear and multination study examining the connections among symbols, language, culture, and ethics. In the Chilean case, the concern is with identifying the structure of political symbolism in building, communicating, and cultivating ethical responses. This article equally highlights an interdisciplinary approach that builds on the respective disciplines of the authors: public administration (Smith), international relations and comparative politics (Morris), and economics (Riveros).									0	0	0	0	0	0			0730-9139			WOS:000319182300008

GP-5000HT precision glass molding machine has been found to be a capable tool for bridging the gap between research-level instruments and the higher volume production machines typically used in industry, providing a means to apply the results of rigorous instrumentation analysis performed in the lab to industrial PGM applications. The GP-5000HT's thermal and mechanical functionality is explained and characterized through the measurement baseline functionality and the associated error. These baseline measurements were used to determine the center thickness repeatability of pressed glass parts, which is the main metric used in industrial pressing settings. The baselines and the repeatability tests both confirmed the need for three warm-up pressing cycles before the press reaches a thermal steady state. The baselines used for pressing a 2 mm glass piece to a 1 mm target center thickness yielded an average center thickness of 1.001 mm and a standard deviation of thickness of 0.0055 mm for glass samples pressed over 3 consecutive days. The baseline tests were then used to deconvolve the sources of error of final pressed piece center thickness.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1687-8132			WOS:000318718100001

The sensor is a planar crystalline silicon waveguide, which is highly transparent, between lambda = 1.3 and 6.5 mu m, so that its operational spectral range covers most characteristic chemical absorption bands due to bonds such as C-H, N-H, O-H, C-C, N-O, C=O, and C=N, as opposed to conventional UV, Vis, Near-IR sensors, which use weaker overtones of these fundamental bands. To extend light transmission beyond lambda = 3.7 mu m, a spectral region where a typical silicon dioxide under-clad is absorbing, we fabricate a unique air-clad silicon pedestal waveguide. The sensing mechanism of our Mid-IR waveguide sensor is based on evanescent wave absorption by functional groups of the surrounding chemical molecules, which selectively absorb specific wavelengths in the mid-IR, depending on the nature of their chemical bonds. From a measurement of the waveguide mode intensities, we demonstrate in situ identification of chemical compositions and concentrations of organic solvents. For instance, we show that when testing at lambda = 3.55 mu m, the Mid-IR sensor can distinguish hexane from the rest of the tested analytes (methanol, toluene, carbon tetrachloride, ethanol and acetone), since hexane has a strong absorption from the aliphatic C-H stretch at l = 3.55 mu m. Analogously, applying the same technique at lambda = 3.3 mm, the Mid-IR sensor is able to determine the concentration of toluene dissolved in carbon tetrachloride, because toluene has a strong absorption at lambda = 3.3 mm from the aromatic C-H stretch. With our demonstration of an air-clad silicon pedestal waveguide sensor, we move closer towards the ultimate goal of an ultra-compact portable spectrometer-on-a-chip.									27	0	0	0	0	27			1473-0197			WOS:000318514400018	23620303

However, our current understanding regarding the systemic toxicity of these CBN through intravenous (iv) injection is limited. In this study, we compare the immune response resulting from GNS and MWCNT exposure. We hypothesize that iv administration of GNS and MWCNT would result in divergent systemic inflammatory responses due to physicochemical differences between these two CBN. In the lungs of C57BL/6 mice, GNS actuate a Th2 immune response 1 day following iv administration, which consists of neutrophilic influx and a significant increase in interleukin (IL)-5, IL-13, IL-33, and its soluble receptor (sST2) in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. MWCNT elicited a significant increase in the messenger ribonucleic acid expression of cytokines in the spleen including IL-4 and IL-33, which are associated with an increase in splenic cell differentiation (CD)(4+) and CD8+ T-cells in C57BL/6 mice following iv injection. The observed Th2 responses in both the lung and spleen are absent in ST2(-/-) mice administrated GNS or MWCNT, suggesting a critical role for IL-33. In conclusion, the use of GNS or MWCNT as nanocarriers for drug delivery may result in Th2 immune responses that are mediated through the IL-33/ST2 axis and therefore may promote adverse allergic reactions.									29	0	0	20	0	29			1178-2013			WOS:000318335100001	23662055

Conductive electroactive polymers (CEPs) are one dimensional organic semiconductors synthesized from aromatic monomers into extended pi-conjugated polymers. The synthesis of CEP's, in association with hydrogels, produces a class of hybrid materials with the conductivity of the CEP and inherent biocompatibility of the hydrogel. CEPs provide a means for the additive electrodeposition of biorecognition molecules to specific nano- and micron-dimensioned metallic and semiconducting sites on microfabricated metallic or semiconductor MEMS devices. Through judicious engineering of repeat unit chemistry, polymer architecture, crosslink density and microstructure, the mechanical, transport and surface properties may be controlled. Implanted, these materials enable programmed low voltage electro-release of factors suitable for mitigating inflammatory response. Finally, these hydrogels can accommodate supramolecular assemblies of CNTs and enzymes supporting direct electron transfer for generation-3 biosensors and implantable biofuel cells.

So far, during three high-cadence observation campaigns with the X-ray telescopes XMM-Newton and Chandra from 2006 until 2009 we detected 21 CNe, only four of which were seen in X-rays before. This increased the total number of known CNe with X-ray counterparts in M 31 to 60, which is significantly larger than for any other galaxy, including the Milky Way. We compiled a catalog of X-ray and optical properties for these 60 sources which allowed us to perform source statistics and population studies of CNe with SSS state in M 31 for the first time. Here we review the results of this analysis: (i) several correlations between X-ray and optical parameters, (ii) an analysis of the intrinsic fraction of CNe with SSS state, and (iii) the first nova population study in X-rays. Our first results are promising, however a continuing monitoring of the unique target M 31 is strongly needed to extend this valuable data base and to refine the early statements and predictions.					281st Symposium of the International-Astronomical-Union281st Symposium of the International-Astronomical-Union	JUL 04-08, 2011JUL 04-08, 2011	INAF; City Padova; Univ Padova, Dept Astronomy; INAF Padova Observ; ANEMOSINAF; City Padova; Univ Padova, Dept Astronomy; INAF Padova Observ; ANEMOS	Padova, ITALYPadova, ITALY	1	0	0	0	0	1			1743-9213		978-1-107-01981-2	WOS:000316706100023

Sherwood-Rayleigh Parameterization for Evaporation in the Presence of Surfactant Monolayers								AICHE JOURNAL				59	1			303	315		10.1002/aic.13792			JAN 2013	2013	Presented here is an experimental investigation of the effects of several surfactant monolayers on evaporation driven by natural convection in the air above a water surface. Experiments were performed in a controlled laboratory setting with tanks of heated water for the following cases: (1) a clean water surface, and for surfaces covered with monolayers of (2) oleyl alcohol, (3) stearic acid, and (4) stearyl alcohol. Evaporation rates were measured using a laser-based method, and the Sherwood and Rayleigh numbers, Sh and Ra, were computed from the data. Power law scalings of the form Sh B center dot Ra-m were developed for each case which yielded, essentially, m = 1/3 for all four surface conditions. The oleyl alcohol and stearic acid conditions give essentially the same value for B as for the clean surface case. For stearyl alcohol, B is smaller than for all other surface conditions; this result is attributed to the ability of the stearyl alcohol monolayer to inhibit evaporation by blocking the passage of water molecules through the monolayer: the barrier effect. The surface temperature is measured in this work enabling a separation of the effect of surfactants on evaporation due to a reduction in surface temperature from their effect on evaporation due to a true barrier effect. This has not been accomplished heretofore. (C) 2012 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 59: 303-315, 2013									2	0	0	1	0	2			0001-1541			WOS:000317462700030

Mason, Scott/A-2934-2011				An Analysis of Special Needs Student Busing								JOURNAL OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION				16	1			21	45					2013	2013	Population growth can lead to public school capacity issues as well as increased school bus utilization, which, in turn, can result in longer school bus transport times for regular and special needs students. Special needs or medically fragile students are children with special health care needs who are at increased health and safety risk. It is common practice to provide special needs students with specially-equipped buses and/or special classroom environments with specific facilities or services. However, the assignment of student services to schools is regularly made without regard to bus transportation considerations for special needs students. Considering the potentially negative impact of long school bus rides on these students, we present the first systematic, integrated analyses of special needs student busing and classroom assignments. We provide models and algorithms for maintaining administration-based transportation financial performance measures while simultaneously designing smarter transportation networks considering both student geographical location and service needs.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1077-291X			WOS:000316031500002

In addition, personality perceptions were found to mediate partially the relation between altruistic behavior and job ratings (i.e. advancement potential and reward recommendations)Originality/value Research findings on citizenship behavior and personality are often based on the results of non-experimental designs. This paper utilized a randomized experiment to investigate a mediating effect using a contemporary approach for testing hypothesized mediation.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0268-3946	1758-7778		WOS:000316237300009

The research took place in a two-county area straddling the Blue Ridge Parkway in the Appalachian mountains of Virginia, USA. It was commissioned in order to develop a sustainable tourism centerpiece to enhance the region and encourage visitor expenditures while maintaining the environment and quality of life of the community. In response to Hollinshead and Jamal's 2007 call for a more bricoleur and third ear approach to tourism research, a gap analysis of the region's tourism offerings was performed using six interdisciplinary, mixed-method research phases seeking to identify discrepancies between the current region's tourism offerings, visitor preferences and community stakeholders. Phases included a Community Resource Assessment (GIS-based Inventory), Stakeholder Interviews, a Visitor Survey and GPS visitor tracking, the development of seven Potential Scenarios, a Potential Visitor Survey and an Economic Analysis. Subsequently, two potential tourism centerpieces were developed with the goal of showcasing the region's unique mountain and agricultural heritage. In addition to providing a detailed overview of the research project, the paper concludes with discussion of the practical and political challenges, time constraints and rewards that accompany this type of research.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0966-9582			WOS:000316116000001

Geology Museum-Based Learning in Soil Science Education								Natural Sciences Education				42				43	48		10.4195/nse.2012.0005			2013	2013	Museums provide unique learning opportunities in soil science. The Bob Campbell Geology Museum in Clemson, SC, features an exhibit of minerals and rocks common in the state and in its geologic history. We developed a hands-on laboratory exercise utilizing an exhibit that gives college students an opportunity to visualize regional minerals and rocks from which regional soil parent materials are derived. Clemson University students from various majors had a field trip and a hands-on experience with the local minerals and rocks during FNR 204: Soil Information Systems course taught in the fall 2008, summer 2011, and fall 2011 (134 students total). Students were then asked to fill out a survey providing answers to 15 questions related to their learning experience. Sixty-six percent of the students had never visited a Geology Museum before this field trip and 40% of the students did not know about the Geology Museum's existence on campus. Ninety-three percent of the students thought the visit to the Geology Museum would be helpful with preparation for class quizzes and exams, and 92% of the students would recommend that their friends visit this museum in their free time. Overall, student responses to the questionnaire about their laboratory experience at the Geology Museum were positive. Laboratory exercises that are specifically designed to bridge university-level course material and museum collections produce learning synergy that is greater than either an independent museum visit or classroom instruction.Impact Statement Geology museums commonly exhibit minerals and rocks common of an area and in its geologic history. We describe an example of museum based learning in introductory level soil science course that creates a synergy between a course laboratory and a museum collection. A post-museum visit survey of the students indicated that 66% of the students have never visited the geology museum before, and 93% of the students indicated that this visit was useful for the preparation for quizzes and exams in the course.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2168-8273	2168-8281		BCI:BCI201300313842

Proper ligament balancing, as well as knee laxity, has been shown to play an important role in optimizing kinematic behavior of these implant systems and improving long-term survival of the implant. This study investigates the effect of different simulated ligament laxity conditions of the anterior cruciate ligament and the posterior cruciate ligament on the resulting anteroposterior and mediolateral contact kinematics for medial and lateral pairs of UKR implants with flat and symmetric ultrahigh-molecular-weight polyethylene inserts during force-controlled ISO-14243-1 knee testing simulation. A novel method of capturing the tibiofemoral lowest point contact path was used to calculate the shear plane lowest point contact path kinematics in both the anteroposterior and the mediolateral directions. The results illustrated that multiple clinically relevant soft tissue configurations produce statistically different measured knee kinematics in unicondylar knee replacement systems than is seen in accepted "standard" knee simulator protocols with 95% confidence interval. The observed kinematic differences in anteroposterior and mediolateral movement from what was observed using standard wear testing protocols could aid in the development of unicondylar knee replacement design enhancements that are resistant to varying soft tissue deficiencies.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0954-4119			WOS:000316636800003	23516953

At the Cook Like a Chef camp for youth, the social cognitive theory supports increased cooking confidence as documented in areas of preparing healthy snacks, using healthy cooking techniques, eating healthy foods, and having a positive attitude toward food (P <.0001). Increased confidence was also seen in sauteing (P =.0026), stir-frying (P =.0015), limiting fat (P <.0001), limiting sugar (P <.0001), and eating more fiber (P <.0001). Cooking camps can influence cooking confidence and help children make healthier food choices.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0883-5691	1550-5146		WOS:000209552600005

Increased pepper yields following incorporation of biofumigation cover crops and the effects on soilborne pathogen populations and pepper diseases								APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY				63				67	77		10.1016/j.apsoi1.2012.09.007			JAN 2013	2013	The use of brassica cover crops and their associated degradation compounds as biofumigants to manage soilborne pathogens could offer vegetable growers an alternative to the restricted broad-spectrum fumigant methyl bromide. Biofumigation was tested in two experiments to manage Rhizoctonia solani, Sclerotium rolfsii, and Pythium spp., and the diseases they cause on pepper. Field plots were seeded in fall 2010 and spring 2011 to oilseed radish (Raphanus sativus L.), 'Pacific Gold' mustard (Brassica juncea (L.) Czern), or 'Dwarf Essex' winter rapeseed (Brassica napus L). Cover crops were disked into soil in spring 2011 and immediately covered with virtually impermeable film (VIF) to reduce the escape of volatile pesticidal compounds. Controls included fallow plots with (CVIF) and without (fallow) VIF. Green bell pepper was transplanted into all plots. Concentrations of isothiocyanates (ITCs), the brassica degradation compounds primarily responsible for pesticidal activity, were highest following incorporation of mustard. Rapeseed yielded the second highest ITC concentrations. Radish yielded very low ITC concentrations in experiment 1, and none during experiment 2. ITCs also were detected in low concentrations in CVIF treatments. All treatments that received VIF reduced populations of R. solani compared to fallow, with no differences between biofumigation treatments and CVIF. Biofumigation treatments did not reduce populations of Pythium spp. or S. rolfsii compared to CVIF. Pepper stunting was significantly lower in treatments that received VIF compared to fallow, with no consistently significant differences between biofumigation treatments and CVIF. Pythium isolated from roots of stunted peppers was identified as Pythium aphanidermatum. Biofumigation treatments did not reduce plant mortality. Pepper yields were highest in biofumigation treatments compared to CVIF, and CVIF yields were higher than fallow yields. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The Enabling Potential of Constraints								JOURNAL OF LEISURE RESEARCH				45	2			136	149					2013	2013	The purpose of this brief note is to share findings of an exploratory study focusing on a new measurement instrument. This article describes a 13-item scale, Enabling Outcomes Scale (EOS), designed to measure the enabling potential of constraints. The content of the scale was shaped by theoretical discussions in Kleiber, McGuire, and Aybar-Damali (2004) and Kleiber, McGuire, Aybar-Damali, and Norman (2008), which suggest that constraints have enabling potentials. Data on the psychometric properties of the scale are presented including its factor structure, internal consistency, and validity. The findings indicate that the scale shows promise as a tool for extending our insight regarding how to expand the use of constraints as a construct in leisure research.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0022-2216			WOS:000315842500002

Modeling tensile strength of materials processed by accumulative roll bonding								JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES				15	2			219	226		10.1016/j.jmapro.2013.02.001			2013	2013	Nanostructured materials are a relatively new class of materials that exhibit advanced mechanical properties, thus improving performance and capabilities of products, with potential applications in the automotive, aerospace and defense industries. Among the severe plastic deformation (SPD) methods currently used for achieving nanoscale structures, accumulative roll bonding (ARB) is the most favorable method to produce grain refinement for continuous production of metallic sheets at a bulk scale.In this article, a model that describes the evolution of material strength due to processing via accumulative roll bonding was developed. ARB experiments were conducted on CP-Ti Grade 2 at a selected set of conditions. The results showed significant grain refinement in the microstructure (down to similar to 120 nm) and a two-fold increase in tensile strength as compared to the as-received material. The developed model was validated using the experimental data, and exhibited a good fit over the entire range of ARB processing cycles. To further validate the model and ensure its robustness for a wider array of materials (beyond CP-Ti), a review of efforts on ARB processing was carried out for five other materials with different initial microstructures, mechanical properties, and even crystalline structures. The model was still able to capture the strengthening trends in all considered materials. (C) 2013 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Results from a survey of 425 consumers suggested that the hypothesized model was an accurate reflection of factors that affect privacy preferences of consumers. The results provide important implications for research and practice. Our study should contribute by initiating an integrative stream of research on the impact of IT and other factors on information privacy perception. For practitioners, our findings suggested that consumers hold corporations, not the IS, responsible for any inappropriate use of personal information. Organizations, therefore, must be proactive in formulating and enforcing information privacy policy in order to address consumers' concerns. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this study was to analyze how utilizing real-time information dissemination transferring capabilities to vehicles, as envisioned in the "connected vehicle" system, could effectively facilitate the EV charging process at fast-charging stations (CS). By simulating a traffic network of EVs in MATLAB, it was found that the total time due to the battery charging process was optimized at both the individual EV and the entire network levels for EVs that were able to use connected vehicle communications. As a result of this optimization, the improvement of two vehicle parameters, extra travel time due to charging and time spent in the CS queue, as well as two CS parameters, queue length and total energy output, were measured. Through connected vehicle technologies, the average extra travel time due to charging and the average time spent in the CS queue were significantly reduced, resulting in benefits at both a network level and individual vehicle level. However, as a tradeoff of the optimization, the charging infrastructure may need to be upgraded in order to increase the capacity of the network. Most importantly, the benefits of connected vehicle systems were found to steadily increase as the market penetration level of EVs also increased in the varying simulation scenarios.

Using data from a national survey of college students in introductory English courses (on scienc-erelated experiences, particularly in high school), we examine the influence of students' physics and math identities on their choice to pursue a physics career. Males have higher math and physics identities than females in all three dimensions of our identity framework. These dimensions include: performance/competence (perceptions of ability to perform/understand), recognition (perception of recognition by others), and interest (desire to learn more). A regression model predicting students' intentions to pursue physics careers shows, as expected, that males are significantly more likely to choose physics than females. Surprisingly, however, when physics and math identity are included in the model, females are shown to be equally likely to choose physics careers as compared to males.

Kennedy and Widener (2008) use a case study to develop a theoretical framework of management accounting and control practices for firms following a lean manufacturing strategy. We build on Kennedy and Widener (2008) by examining a structural equation model that provides evidence on the extent to which a lean manufacturing implementation is related to five management accounting and control practices. Using survey data from 244 US companies with an interest in lean manufacturing, we find a direct positive relation between the extent of a lean manufacturing implementation and a simplified strategic reporting system, value stream costing, visual performance measurement information, and employee empowerment We find a direct negative relation with inventory tracking; however, we find it is conditional on the extent of top management support for change in production strategies such that firms decrease reliance on inventory tracking in the presence of strong management support. We also conclude that the management accounting and control practices work together as a package in a lean manufacturing environment as evidenced by the many direct associations among the five management accounting and control practices.

ASSESSING MIGRATION OF RUBY-THROATED HUMMINGBIRDS (ARCHILOCHUS COLUBRIS) AT BROAD SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL SCALES								AUK				130	1			107	117		10.1525/auk.2012.12058			JAN 2013	2013	Phenological patterns in birds appear to be temperature-dependent in part, and global temperatures are undergoing change. Many studies of bird phenology are conducted at broad temporal but local spatial scales, making it difficult to assess how temperature affects bird migration across landscapes. Recently, networks of "citizen science" volunteers have emerged whose collective efforts may improve phenology studies as biases associated with such efforts are recognized and addressed. We compared mean Ruby-throated Hummingbird (Archilochus colubris) first arrival dates from Journey North (2001-2010) with data from the North American Bird Phenology Program (1880-1969). Ruby-throated Hummingbirds arrived earlier in the more recent period throughout the eastern United States; these advances, however, varied by latitude from 11.4 to 18.2 days, with less pronounced changes above 41 degrees N. Warmer winter and spring temperatures in North American breeding grounds were correlated with earlier arrivals at lower latitudes in our recent period. Surprisingly, Ruby-throated Hummingbirds arrived later at high latitudes (42-43 degrees N) during warmer winters and later at both mid- and high latitudes (38-39, 41-44 degrees N) during warmer springs, which perhaps indicates extended migratory stopovers below 40 degrees N during these years. Overall, weather variables predicted arrival dates better in the recent than in the historical period. Our results document spatial variability in how warming temperatures affect hummingbird arrivals and add credence to the hypothesis that spatial differences in arrival patterns at high versus low latitudes could exacerbate asynchrony between some birds and their food resources and modify associated ecosystem services such as pollination and insect pest suppression.

J	Boylan, Gregory L.; Cho, Byung Rae								Comparative studies on the high-variability embedded robust parameter design from the perspective of estimators								COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING				64	1			442	452		10.1016/j.cie.2012.10.012			JAN 2013	2013	Engineers and scientists often identify robust parameter design (RPD) as one of the most important process and quality improvement methods. Focused on determining the optimum operating conditions that facilitate target attainment with minimum variability, typical approaches to RPD use ordinary least squares methods to obtain response functions for the mean and variance by assuming that process data are normally distributed and exhibit reasonably low variability. Consequently, the sample mean and standard deviation are the most common estimators used in the initial tier of estimation, as they perform best when these assumptions hold. Realistically, however, industrial processes often exhibit high variability, particularly in mass production lines. If ignored, such conditions can cause the quality of the estimates obtained using the sample mean and standard deviation to deteriorate. This paper examines several alternatives to the sample mean and standard deviation, incorporating them into RPD modeling and optimization approaches to ascertain which tend to yield better solutions when highly variable conditions prevail. Monte Carlo simulation and numerical studies are used to compare the performances of the proposed methods with the traditional approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Synthesis of diazonium (perfluoroalkyl) benzenesulfonylimide zwitterions								JOURNAL OF FLUORINE CHEMISTRY				145				35	40		10.1016/j.jfluchem.2012.11.007			JAN 2013	2013	The synthesis and properties of diazonium (perfluoroalkyl) benzenesulfonylimide (PFSI) zwitterions are described. The general procedures for the diazonium PFSI zwitterions involve three steps: (1) a coupling reaction, (2) a reduction reaction and (3) a diazotization reaction. These novel diazonium PFSI zwitterions represent a new versatile class of remarkably stable diazonium materials with potential for modification of carbon supports for electrodes in proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells.

This time dependence has been linked to the formation of linear aggregates or chains in an applied magnetic field via numerical modeling. It is widely known that chain formation occurs in more concentrated ferrofluids systems and that this has an affect on the ferrofluid properties. In this work we examine the relationships between colloidal stability, the formation of these linear structures, and changes observed in the proton transverse relaxation rate of aqueous suspensions of magnetic particles. A series of iron oxide nanoparticles with varying stabilizing ligand brush lengths were synthesized. These systems were characterized with dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, dark-field optical microscopy, and proton transverse relaxation rate measurements. The dark field optical microscopy and R-2 measurements were made in similar magnetic fields over the same time scale so as to correlate the reduction of the transverse relaxivity with the formation of linear aggregates. Our results indicate that varying the ligand length has a direct effect on the colloidal arrangement of the system in a magnetic field, producing differences in the rate and size of chain formation, and hence systematic changes in transverse relaxation rates over time. With increasing ligand brush length, attractive inter-particle interactions are reduced, which results in slower aggregate formation and shorter linear aggregate length. These results have implications for the stabilization, characterization and potentially the toxicity of magnetic nanoparticle systems used in biomedical applications.									23	0	0	4	0	23			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000314931900061	23389324

Compared to the non-A. awamori-fermented LPP, the growth effects of A. awamori-fermented LPP on Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus were four and two times higher a. er 3 days of fermentation, respectively. Increased 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity and DNA protection activity of litchi pericarp polysaccharides were also achieved a. er A. awamori fermentation. Moreover, the relative content of glucose and arabinose in LPP a. er fermentation decreased from 58.82% to 22.60% and from 18.82% to 10.09%, respectively, with a concomitant increase in the relative contents of galactose, rhamnose, xylose, and mannose. Furthermore, lower molecular weight polysaccharides were obtained a. er A. awamori fermentation. It can be concluded that A. awamori was effective in biotransforming LPP into a bioactive mixture with lower molecular weight polysaccharides and higher antioxidant activity and relative galactose content.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2314-6133			WOS:000314942300001

Lightweight electromagnetic attenuation composites embedded with carbon materials, specifically carbon nanosheets or graphene, are considered to offer promising attenuation performance due to their excellent electrical properties. Generally, graphene and carbon nanosheets are mostly achieved via chemical oxidation and subsequent reduction of commercial graphite, and the recovery of the electrical properties for the resulting products substantially depends on the reducing approaches. In this work, a direct chemical exfoliation approach has been applied to fabricate carbon nanosheets without sacrificing electrical properties. Thickness effects of the carbon nanosheets on the percolation threshold were investigated in the ethylene-vinyl acetate-based composites. These polymeric composites filled with thickness-decreased carbon nanosheets were found to exhibit much lower percolation threshold compared to those filled with unexfoliated ones. Thickness-dependent dielectric properties and electromagnetic attenuation were investigated via a direct comparison between unexfoliated and thickness-decreased carbon nanosheets along with corresponding paraffin wax-based composites. The enhanced complex permittivity and efficient electromagnetic attenuation coupled with broadened attenuation bandwidth were observed in the wax-based composites filled with thickness-decreased carbon nanosheets, and the related mechanism was discussed.									41	1	0	0	0	41			2050-7526			WOS:000314809100021		
J	Yu, Min; Urban, Marek W.								Morphological control of ferromagnetic nanotubes: wall thickness, diameter, and length								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C				1	9			1863	1869		10.1039/c3tc00645j			2013	2013	Although magnetic nanotubes exhibit many potential applications ranging from drug or gene delivery to bioseparation, catalysis, electromagnetic or magneto-optic devices, and many others, their developments are at relatively infant stages. Recently, we utilized biologically active phospholipids (PLs) as templates to produce ferromagnetic magnetite/carbon/magnetite concentric nanotubes (FMNTs) in which simple synthetic efforts resulted in the formation of an electrically conductive carbon layer sandwiched between ferromagnetic magnetite phases, thus offering magnetic and electric attributes combined in one nanotube. Since the geometry and size of each of the FMNT components are critical factors in controlling desirable magnetic and electrical properties, control of the wall thickness as well as the diameter and length is of particular interest. This study reports the development of a simple synthetic approach to control the geometry of FMNTs by changing the concentration levels of the reactants and solvent conditions. Using this approach we synthesized concentric carbon-magnetite nanotubes with a variable thickness of 6, 10, and 60 nm conductive carbon layers and 12 to 45 nm magnetic magnetite layers. As a result, saturation magnetization values could be incrementally tuned from 40 to 79 emu g(-1).									1	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7526			WOS:000314809100023		
J	Prabhu, Saurabh; Atamturktur, Sez								Feature Assimilation for Vibration Based Damage Detection								JOURNAL OF TESTING AND EVALUATION				41	1			39	49		10.1520/JTE20120170			JAN 2013	2013	Structural health monitoring (SHM) technology for the early detection and mitigation of adverse structural effects, such as degradation or damage, is useful for enhancing the proactive maintenance of civil infrastructure. SHM techniques are advantageous because they eliminate the need for both a priori knowledge of the location of damage and access to the damaged portion of the structure. The underlying principle behind SHM involves measuring changes in a system's vibration response, which ultimately indicate changes in physical properties due to structural damage. A challenge to the successful application of SHM to civil infrastructure is the selection of suitable vibration response features that are highly sensitive to the presence and extent of damage while also having low sensitivity to extraneous noise. This study reveals that both damage and the noise sensitivity of vibration response features vary for different states of structural health; therefore, the selection of optimum features is dependent on the damage severity, which is of course not known a priori. This study illustrates that assimilating multiple low-dimensional features lessens this dependence and improves the sensitivity of the damage indicators for SHM diagnosis.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0090-3973			WOS:000315009100005

A key challenge is to load a high degree of targeting, imaging, and therapeutic functionality onto stable metal-oxide nanoparticles. Here we report a route for producing magnetic nanoclusters (MNCs) with alkyne surface functionality that can be utilized as multimodal imaging probes. We form MNCs composed of magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles and poly(acrylic acid-co-propargyl acrylate) by the co-precipitation of iron salts in the presence of copolymer stabilizers. The MNCs were surface-modified with near-infrared (NIR) emitting fluorophore used in photodynamic therapy, an azide-modified indocyanine green. The fluorophores engaged and complexed with bovine serum albumin, forming an extended coverage of serum proteins on the MNCs. These proteins isolated indocyanine green fluorophores from the aqueous environment and induced an effective "turn-on" of NIR emission.									14	0	0	4	0	14			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000314082800025	23205763	
J	Azam, Hossain M.; Finneran, Kevin T.								Ferric iron amendment increases Fe(III)-reducing microbial diversity and carbon oxidation in on-site wastewater systems								CHEMOSPHERE				90	4			1435	1443		10.1016/j.chemosphere.2012.09.002			JAN 2013	2013	Onsite wastewater systems, or septic tanks, serve approximately 25% of the United States population; they are therefore a critical component of the total carbon balance for natural water bodies. Septic tanks operate under strictly anaerobic conditions, and fermentation is the dominant process driving carbon transformation. Nitrate, Fe(III), and sulfate reduction may be operating to a limited extent in any given septic tank. Electron acceptor amendments will increase carbon oxidation, but nitrate is toxic and sulfate generates corrosive sulfides, which may damage septic system infrastructure. Fe(III) reducing microorganisms transform all major classes of organic carbon that are dominant in septic wastewater: low molecular weight organic acids, carbohydrate monomers and polymers, and lipids. Fe(III) is not toxic, and the reduction product Fe(II) is minimally disruptive if the starting Fe(III) is added at 50-150 mg L-1. We used C-14 radiolabeled acetate, lactate, propionate, butyrate, glucose, starch, and oleic acid to demonstrate that short and long-term carbon oxidation is increased when different forms of Fe(III) are amended to septic wastewater. The rates of carbon mineralization to (CO2)-C-14 increased 2-5 times (relative to unamended systems) in the presence of Fe(III). The extent of mineralization reached 90% for some carbon compounds when Fe(III) was present, compared to levels of 50-60% in the absence of Fe(III). (CH4)-C-14 was not generated when Fe(III) was added, demonstrating that this strategy can limit methane emissions from septic systems. Amplified 165 rDNA restriction analysis indicated that unique Fe(III)-reducing microbial communities increased significantly in Fe(III)-amended incubations, with Fe(III)-reducers becoming the dominant microbial community in several incubations. The form of Fe(III) added had a significant impact on the rate and extent of mineralization; ferrihydrite and lepidocrocite were favored as solid phase Fe(III) and chelated Fe(III) (with nitrilotriacetic acid or EDTA) as soluble Fe(III) forms.

Each site was a replicated experiment with a common design that compared an un-manipulated control, prescribed fire, mechanical and mechanical + fire treatments. Variables within the vegetation, fuelbed, forest floor and soil, bark beetles, tree diseases and wildlife were measured in 10-ha stands, and ecological response was compared among treatments at the site level, and across sites, to better understand the influence of differential site conditions. For most sites, treated stands were predicted to be more resilient to wildfire if it occurred shortly after treatment, but for most ecological variables, short-term response to treatments was subtle and transient. Strong site-specificity was observed in the response of most ecosystem variables, suggesting that practitioners employ adaptive management at the local scale. Because ecosystem components were tightly linked, adaptive management would need to include monitoring of a carefully chosen set of key variables. Mechanical treatments did not serve as surrogates for fire for most variables, suggesting that fire be maintained whenever possible. Restoration to pre-settlement conditions will require repeated treatments over time, with eastern forests requiring more frequent applications.									20	1	0	16	0	21			1049-8001	1448-5516		WOS:000314603700007

A commercial gauge was adapted as a low-cost instrument with a spherical antechamber for measurements in molecular flow conditions. Three roll-stabilized payloads on different trajectories each carried two instruments for measurements near the ram flow direction along the respective upleg and downleg segments of a flight path, and six density profiles were obtained within a period of 22 min covering spatial separations up to 200 km. The density profiles were integrated below 125 km to yield temperatures. The mean temperature structure was similar for all six profiles with two mesopause minima near 110 and 101 km, however, for the downleg profiles, the upper minimum was warmer and the lower minimum was colder by 20-30 K indicating significant variability over horizontal scales of 100-200 km. The upper temperature minimum coincided with maximum horizontal winds speeds, exceeding 170 m/s. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The objectives of this study were to elucidate the landside levee scour characteristics and evaluate the effectiveness of selected scour counter measures. Model levees, both with and without a scour protection measure, were constructed. Four scour protection armoring were tested: riprap, coreloc, riprap with an underlayer, and coreloc with an underlayer. The levee soil was composed of a sand-clay mixture. The geometric scour characteristics of interest driven by their practical importance were maximum scour depth and scour length. Both the maximum scour depth and the scour length exhibited an exponential trend in approaching equilibrium values, with the scour length reaching equilibrium sooner. Parameterizations for predicting the values of the maximum scour depth and length while approaching the equilibrium and at the equilibrium state were developed. Though the riprap armoring cover proved more effective than the coreloc armoring cover, the presence of an armoring underlayer was a greater impetus of the overall effectiveness of both protection measure types. Therefore, it is recommended that the placement and size distribution of the underlayer be adjusted in the field accordingly for the greatest disaster prevention and economic advantage.

J	Jacobson, M. R.; Testik, F. Y.								On the concentration structure of high-concentration constant-volume fluid mud gravity currents								PHYSICS OF FLUIDS				25	1					016602	10.1063/1.4774045			JAN 2013	2013	An exhaustive laboratory experimental campaign was undertaken in order to elucidate the concentration structure of two-dimensional constant-volume non-Newtonian fluid mud gravity currents. Two sets of experiments were conducted in a lock-exchange tank. The first set of experiments involved measuring the vertical concentration profiles using a siphoning technique; the second set involved auxiliary visual observations. The first set of experiments consisted of 32 experimental runs for four different experimental conditions, with an array of siphoned samples being withdrawn throughout the head and body of the gravity current. From these samples, vertical concentration profiles occurring in constant-volume fluid mud gravity currents were classified and the underlying physical processes that led to the occurrence of observed profiles were discussed. Furthermore, the functional form of the vertical concentration profiles within the head of relatively low-initial-concentration gravity currents was proposed. The relatively high-initial-concentration gravity currents revealed the presence of a lutocline in the current head and body, the presence of which was observed for constant-flux release gravity currents. To our knowledge, this is the first measurement of a lutocline in constant-volume gravity currents. Abrupt transitions, a phenomenon in which the bulk of the suspended sediment in the propagating gravity current drops out, were observed through the concentration profiles and through 15 auxiliary visual experimental runs. It was found that abrupt transitions were caused by the presence of a lutocline. The entrainment of ambient water resulting in the dilution of the gravity current at different concentration contours has been quantified. In a previous work by the authors of this study, it was shown that the initial reduced gravity is directly proportional to the growth rate of the visual area of the two-dimensional current. The analysis of our experimental observations presented in this study, however, showed the initial reduced gravity to be inversely proportional to the growth rate of the area enclosed by concentration contours with higher values than that of the visual area. These seemingly opposing conclusions are rationalized and the considerable practical impacts are discussed. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

Maternal Pre-Pregnancy Weight and Gestational Weight Gain and Their Association with Birthweight with a Focus on Racial Differences								MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH JOURNAL				17	1			85	94		10.1007/s10995-012-0950-x			JAN 2013	2013	Our objectives were to examine the interaction between maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and gestational weight gain (GWG) and their association with birthweight, with a focus on racial differences. We used birth certificate data from live singleton births of South Carolina resident mothers, who self-reported their race as non-Hispanic white (NHW, n = 140, 128) or non-Hispanic black (NHB, n = 82,492) and who delivered at 34-44 weeks of gestation between 2004 and 2008 to conduct a cross-sectional study. Linear regression was used to examine the relationship between our exposures (i.e., race, BMI and GWG) and our outcome birthweight. Based on 2009 Institute of Medicine guidelines, the prevalence of adequate, inadequate and excessive GWG was 27.1, 24.2 and 48.7%, respectively, in NHW women and 24.2, 34.8 and 41.0%, respectively, in NHB women. Adjusting for infant sex, gestational age, maternal age, tobacco use, education, prenatal care, and Medicaid, the difference in birthweight between excessive and adequate GWG at a maternal BMI of 30 kg/m(2) was 118 g (95% CI: 109, 127) in NHW women and 101 g (95% CI: 91, 111) in NHB women. Moreover, excessive versus adequate GWG conveyed similar protection from having a small for gestational age infant in NHW [OR = 0.64 (95% CI 0.61, 0.67)] and NHB women [OR = 0.68 (95% CI: 0.65, 0.72)]. In conclusion, we report a strong association between excessive GWG and higher infant birthweight across maternal BMI classes in NHW and NHB women. Given the high prevalence of excessive GWG even a small increase in birthweight may have considerable implications at the population level.									17	0	0	7	0	17			1092-7875			WOS:000314282500013	22322428

Other than species descriptions for four taxa little is known about these yeasts. Investigations were carried out to determine the ecological relationship and specificity with nematodes in addition to examining basic cell structure, thallus development and sexual reproduction. Based on previous examinations of the yeast and nematode it was hypothesized the fungus did not parasitize the nematode but instead remained attached to nematodes for dispersal. Electron micrographs supported our hypotheses and revealed a specialized cell wall and mucilage that aid in attachment to the nematode cuticle. Tests to determine the ability of Ascobotryozyma and Botryozyma to attach to different nematode taxa revealed that attachment varies across taxonomic groups Examinations of thallus cells, thallus growth, cell fusion and ascosporogenesis are presented. This study provides insight into an otherwise cryptic yeast genus.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0027-5514	1557-2536		WOS:000314387000003	22962352

These processes focus on the planning and design phases because they offer the greatest potential for influencing project performance. The concept mapping research method was applied to develop this framework on the basis of input from 25 experts in academia, industry, and government. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analyses were used to organize the experts' input into six categories defining social sustainability in construction projects: stakeholder engagement, user considerations, team formation, management considerations, impact assessment, and place context. Although previous research has recognized social sustainability as a series of processes, this study is the first to integrate them into a comprehensive framework. Practitioners can benefit from this framework, which will enhance existing sustainability assessment methods and help address the challenge of developing truly sustainable projects. This framework also provides academics with a tool for introducing students to social sustainability in construction projects. Future research could use this framework as a baseline, developing metrics using the processes included in the framework. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000566.

Phytophthora isolates associated with ornamental plants or recovered from irrigation water in six states in the southeastern United States (Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia) were identified and screened for sensitivity to mefenoxam. Isolates from forest and suburban streams in Georgia and Virginia were included for comparison. A new in vitro assay, utilizing 48-well tissue culture plates, was used to screen for mefenoxam sensitivity; this assay allowed high throughput of isolates and used less material than the traditional petri plate assay. In total, 1,483 Phytophthora isolates were evaluated, and 27 species were identified with Phytophthora nicotianae, P. hydropathica, and P gonapodyides, the most abundant species associated with plants, irrigation water, and streams, respectively. Only 6% of isolates associated with plants and 9% from irrigation water were insensitive to mefenoxam at 100 mu g a.i./ml. Approximately 78% of insensitive isolates associated with plants were P nicotianae, and most of these (67%) came from herbaceous annual plants. Most of the insensitive isolates recovered from irrigation water were P gonapodyides, P. hydropathica, P megasperma, and P pint, and 83% of the insensitive isolates from streams were P. gonapodyides. Overall, this study suggests that mefenoxam should continue to be a valuable tool in the management of Phytophthora diseases affecting ornamental plants in the southeastern United States.									10	0	0	9	0	10			0191-2917			WOS:000312519200010

J	Burdette, Carolyn Q.; Marcus, R. Kenneth								Solid phase extraction of proteins from buffer solutions employing capillary-channeled polymer (C-CP) fibers as the stationary phase								ANALYST				138	4			1098	1106		10.1039/c2an36126d			2013	2013	Polypropylene (PP) capillary-channeled polymer (C-CP) fibers are applied for solid phase extraction (SPE) of proteins from aqueous buffer solutions using a micropipette tip-based format. A process was developed in which centrifugation is used as the moving force for solution passage in the loading/washing steps instead of the previously employed manual aspiration. The complete procedure requires similar to 15 minutes, with the number of samples run in parallel limited only by the capacity of the centrifuge. The method performance was evaluated based on adsorption and elution characteristics of several proteins (cytochrome c, lysozyme, myoglobin, and glucose oxidase) from 150 mM phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solutions. Protein concentration ranges of similar to 2 to 100 mu g mL(-1) were employed and the recovery characteristics determined through UV-Vis absorbance spectrophotometry for protein quantification. The protein loading capacities across the range of proteins was similar to 1.5 mu g for the 5 mg fiber tips. Average recoveries from PBS were determined for each protein sample; cytochrome c similar to 86%, lysozyme similar to 80%, myoglobin similar to 86%, and glucose oxidase similar to 89%. Recoveries from more complex matrices, synthetic urine and synthetic saliva, were determined to be similar to 90%. A 10x dilution study for a fixed 1 mu g protein application yielded 94 +/- 3.2% recoveries. The C-CP tips provided significantly higher recoveries for myoglobin in a 150 mM PBS matrix in comparison to a commercially available protein SPE product, with the added advantages of low cost, rapid processing, and reusability.									11	0	0	4	0	11			0003-2654			WOS:000313805200020	23223274	
J	Jain, Abhiney; Morlok, Charles K.; Henson, J. Michael								Comparison of solid-state and submerged-state fermentation for the bioprocessing of switchgrass to ethanol and acetate by Clostridium phytofermentans								APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY				97	2			905	917		10.1007/s00253-012-4511-4			JAN 2013	2013	The conversion of sustainable energy crops using microbiological fermentation to biofuels and bioproducts typically uses submerged-state processes. Alternatively, solid-state fermentation processes have several advantages when compared to the typical submerged-state processes. This study compares the use of solid-state versus submerged-state fermentation using the mesophilic anaerobic bacterium Clostridium phytofermentans in the conversion of switchgrass to the end products of ethanol, acetate, and hydrogen. A shift in the ratio of metabolic products towards more acetate and hydrogen production than ethanol production was observed when C. phytofermentans was grown under solid-state conditions as compared to submerged-state conditions. Results indicated that the end product concentrations (in millimolar) obtained using solid-state fermentation were higher than using submerged-state fermentation. In contrast, the total fermentation products (in weight of product per weight of carbohydrates consumed) and switchgrass conversion were higher for submerged-state fermentation. The conversion of xylan was greater than glucan conversion under both fermentation conditions. An initial pH of 7 and moisture content of 80 % resulted in maximum end products formation. Scanning electron microscopy study showed the presence of biofilm formed by C. phytofermentans growing on switchgrass under submerged-state fermentation whereas bacterial cells attached to surface and no apparent biofilm was observed when grown under solid-state fermentation. To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting consolidated bioprocessing of a lignocellulosic substrate by a mesophilic anaerobic bacterium under solid-state fermentation conditions.									11	0	0	5	1	12			0175-7598			WOS:000313651700040	23111595

Classical novae (CNe) represent the main class of supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs) in the central region of our neighbouring galaxy M 31. Only three confirmed novae and three SSSs have been discovered in globular clusters (GCs) of any galaxy so far, of which one nova and two SSSs (including the nova) were found in M 31 GCs.Aims. To study the SSS state of CNe we carried out a high-cadence X-ray monitoring of the M 31 central area with XMM-Newton and Chandra. This project is supplemented by regular optical monitoring programmes at various observatories.Methods. We analysed X-ray and optical monitoring data of a new transient X-ray source in the M 31 GC Bol 126, discovered serendipitously in Swift observations. Our optical data set was based on regular M 31 monitoring programmes from five different small telescopes and was reduced using a homogeneous method. Additionally, we made use of Pan-STARRS 1 data obtained during the PAndromeda survey. We extracted light curves of the source in the optical and X-rays, as well as X-ray spectra.Results. Our observations reveal that the X-ray source in Bol 126 is the third SSS in an M 31 GC and can be confirmed as the second CN in the M 31 GC system. This nova is named M31N 2010-10f. Its properties in the X-ray (high black-body temperature, short SSS phase) and optical (relatively high maximum magnitude, fast decline) regimes agree with a massive white dwarf (M-WD greater than or similar to 1.3 M-circle dot) in the binary system. Incorporating the data on previously found (suspected) novae in M 31 GCs we used our high-cadence X-ray monitoring observations to estimate a tentative nova rate in the M 31 GC system of 0.05 yr(-1) GC(-1). An optical estimate, based on the recent 10.5-year WeCAPP survey, gives a lower nova rate, which is compatible with the X-ray rate on the 95% confidence level.Conclusions. Although still based on small-number statistics, there is growing evidence that the nova rate in GCs is higher than expected from primordial binary formation and under conditions as in the field. Dynamical binary formation and/or additional accretion from the intracluster medium are possible scenarios for an increased nova rate, but observational confirmation for this enhancement has been absent, so far. Regular X-ray monitoring observations of M 31 provide a promising strategy to find these novae.									5	1	0	0	0	6			0004-6361			WOS:000313745000120

Role of the conserved lysine within the Walker A motif of human DMC1								DNA REPAIR				12	1			53	62		10.1016/j.dnarep.2012.10.005			JAN 1 2013	2013	During meiosis, the RAD51 recombinase and its meiosis-specific homolog DMC1 mediate DNA strand exchange between homologous chromosomes. The proteins form a right-handed nucleoprotein complex on ssDNA called the presynaptic filament. In an ATP-dependent manner, the presynaptic filament searches for homology to form a physical connection with the homologous chromosome. We constructed two variants of hDMC1 altering the conserved lysine residue of the Walker A motif to arginine (hDMC1(K132R)) or alanine (hDMC1(K132A)). The hDMC1 variants were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to near homogeneity. Both hDMC1(K132R) and hDMC1(K132A) variants were devoid of ATP hydrolysis. The hDMC1(K132R) variant was attenuated for ATP binding that was partially restored by the addition of either ssDNA or calcium. The hDMC1(K132R) variant was partially capable of homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange in the presence of calcium and protecting DNA from a nuclease, while the hDMC1(K132A) variant was inactive. These results suggest that the conserved lysine of the Walker A motif in hDMC1 plays a key role in ATP binding. Furthermore, the binding of calcium and ssDNA promotes a conformational change in the ATP binding pocket of hDMC1 that promotes ATP binding. Our results provide evidence that the conserved lysine in the Walker A motif of hDMC1 is critical for ATP binding which is required for presynaptic filament formation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Most patients' records contained sensitive health information.Results No patients reported that they would prefer to share all information stored in an electronic medical record (EMR) with all potential recipients. Sharing preferences varied by type of information (EMR data element) and recipient (eg, primary care provider), and overall sharing preferences varied by participant. Patients with and without sensitive records preferred less sharing of sensitive versus less-sensitive information.Discussion Patients expressed sharing preferences consistent with a desire for granular privacy control over which health information should be shared with whom and expressed differences in sharing preferences for sensitive versus less-sensitive EMR data. The pattern of results may be used by designers to generate privacy-preserving EMR systems including interfaces for patients to express privacy and sharing preferences.Conclusions To maintain the level of privacy afforded by medical records and to achieve alignment with patients' preferences, patients should have granular privacy control over information contained in their EMR.									28	0	0	11	0	28			1067-5027			WOS:000313512900003	23184192

Dayton								Characterization of Peach TFL1 and Comparison with FT/TFL1 Gene Families of the Rosaceae								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE				138	1			12	17					JAN 2013	2013	We investigated the FT/TFL1 family of peach (Prunus persica), a gene family that regulates floral induction in annual and perennial plants. The peach terminal flower 1 gene (PpTFL1) was expressed in a developmental and tissue-specific pattern that, overall, was similar to that of TFL1 orthologs in other woody Rosaceae species. Consistent with a role as a floral inhibitor, ectopic expression of PpTFL1 in arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) delayed flowering and prolonged vegetative growth. Other members of the peach FT/TFL1 family were identified from the sequenced genome, including orthologs of flowering locus T, centroradialis, brother of ft, and mother of ft and tfl. Sequence analysis found that peach FT/TFL1 family members were more similar to orthologous genes across the Rosaceae than to each other. Together these results suggest that information on genes that regulate flowering in peach could be applied to other Rosaceae species, particularly ornamentals.									4	2	0	3	0	5			0003-1062			WOS:000313839600002		
J	Johnston, G. R.; Lee, M. S. Y.; Surasinghe, T. D.				Johnston, Gregory/G-6770-2013				Morphology and allometry suggest multiple origins of rostral appendages in Sri Lankan agamid lizards								JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY				289	1			1	9		10.1111/j.1469-7998.2012.00962.x			JAN 2013	2013	Rostral appendages occur in a very small number of species spread across the entire clade of iguanian lizards. The five species of Sri Lankan agamid lizards of the poorly known endemic genus Ceratophora show remarkable variation in the morphology and development of rostral appendages, which are absent in two species and present in the other three. Parsimony and Bayesian comparative methods do not robustly resolve whether the appendage evolved once (with two losses), twice (with one loss) or thrice independently. The appendage in C. tennentii is leaf-shaped, present in juveniles and monomorphic in adults. It is quite dissimilar to the appendages in C. aspera and C. stoddartii which are horn-shaped, absent in juveniles and dimorphic in adults. Ceratophora stoddartii is more closely related to C. erdeleni, which lacks the rostral appendage, than it is to C. aspera. The combined morphological, allometric and phylogenetic evidence suggests rostral appendages evolved three times within Ceratophora: perhaps once as a result of natural selection for crypsis (in C. tennentii) and twice as a result of sexual selection (in C. aspera and C. stoddartii). Our results suggest that these unusual ornaments can evolve by more than one mechanism and more readily than is suggested by their low frequency among iguanian lizards.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0952-8369	1469-7998		WOS:000313830900001

Error covariance matrix estimation using ridge estimator								STATISTICS & PROBABILITY LETTERS				83	1			257	264		10.1016/j.spl.2012.09.011			JAN 2013	2013	This article considers sparse covariance matrix estimation of high dimension. In contrast to the existing methods which are based on the residual estimation from least squares estimator, we utilize residuals from ridge estimator with the adaptive thresholding technique to estimate the error covariance matrix in high dimensional factor model. By obtaining the explicit convergence rates of the ridge estimator under regularity conditions, we formulated our thresholding estimator of the true covariance matrix. Our thresholding estimator can be applied to more scenarios and is shown to have comparable rate of convergence to Fan et al. (2011). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Underassessed phosphorus fixation mechanisms in soil sand fraction								GEODERMA				192				422	429		10.1016/j.geoderma.2012.06.021			JAN 2013	2013	Eutrophication caused by phosphorus (P) rich leachate from sandy soils has been one of the major ago-environmental issues in the world. In predicting P bioavailability in soils. P reactivity in soil clay fractions (e.g., iron oxyhydroxides) has been a major focus of soil chemistry research in the past. However, the role of sand fraction has been rarely investigated to accurately understand the retention and release mechanisms of P in soils, and remains poorly understood. In this case study, we report here on macroscopic and spectroscopic evidence for environmentally important P partitioning mechanisms in soil sand fractions. In the high P sandy soils, total desorbable P from the sand fraction was as high as similar to 50% of total desorbable P from the whole soils, and these bioavailable P were associated with ammonium oxalate extractable Al and Fe. Scanning transmission electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray analysis further revealed that P was associated with amorphous mixed Fe/Al/Si precipitates in the sand grain coating, and was not present with crystalline iron oxyhydroxides like goethite. Bulk- and microfocused-Fe K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy analysis showed that average FeO6 coordination environments in the grain coating did not exactly coincide with that in synthetic goethite, hematite, and ferrihydrite. The coordination numbers of second and third Fe shells were slightly larger/smaller than those in reference iron oxyhydroxides (hematite and goethite), suggesting the perturbation of local chemical structure of FeO6 linkages by Si/Al/P. Our research findings suggest that amorphous Al/Si/Fe grain coatings in soil sand fractions might be important in predicting the release of labile P in the surface and subsurface environment.

Here, the failure is defined when an excavation system's response in terms of the maximum wall deflection or ground settlement that exceeds the limiting value specified by the client or in an applicable code. The analysis for the probability of failure (or probability of exceedance) necessitates an evaluation of the means and SDs of critical soil parameters. In geotechnical practice, these means and SDs are often estimated from a very limited data set, which can lead to uncertainty in the derived sample statistics. Thus, in this study bootstrapping is used to characterize the uncertainty or variation of sample statistics and its effect on the failure probability. Through the bootstrapping analysis, the probability of exceedance can be presented as a confidence interval instead of a single, fixed probability. The information gained should enable the engineer to make a more rational assessment of the risk of serviceability failure in a braced excavation. The study points to the potential of the bootstrap method in coping with the problem of having to evaluate failure probability with uncertain sample statistics.

A discussion on the material requirements for these applications is included. We present X-ray diffraction (XRD) data on single phase materials obtained with SCS, as well as radioluminescence (RL), TL and OSL data of lanthanide-doped materials. The results demonstrate the possibility of producing TL and OSL materials with sensitivity similar to or approaching those of commercial TL and OSL materials used in dosimetry (e.g., LiF:Mg,Ti and Al2O3:C) using SCS. The results also show that the luminescence properties can be improved by Li co-doping and annealing. The presence of an atypical TL background and anomalous fading are discussed and deserve attention in future investigations. We hope that these preliminary results on the use of SCS for production of TL and OSL materials are helpful to guide future efforts towards the development of new luminescence materials for different applications.

The introduction of time-dependent functional relationships between stresses and strains leads to an analysis of the Volterra integral equation of the second kind. In practice, this equation is successfully used in modeling a wide class of structural materials. One of optimum kernels of the operator in the governing equation for describing the deformation of materials with "memory" is the Rabotnov fractional-exponential function. The search for the optimum values of model parameters is reduced to the problem of minimization of a functional. The results of analytic modeling are compared with experimental data obtained in the creep and quasi-static loading of polymer composites containing various carbon modifications in the form of nanotubes. The essential distinctions in the behavior of the nanocomposites are compared. These distinctions are found to correlate with the results of structural investigations by the atomic-force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and micro- and nanoindentation.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0191-5665			WOS:000313812200010

This novel effort meets all functional criteria for a biomedical implant coating as it is chemically inert, atomically smooth and highly durable, with the potential for greatly enhancing the effectiveness of such implants. Specifically, graphene coatings on nitinol, a widely used implant and stent material, showed that graphene coated nitinol (Gr-NiTi) supports excellent smooth muscle and endothelial cell growth leading to better cell proliferation. The authors further determined that the serum albumin adsorption on Gr-NiTi is greater than that of fibrinogen, which is an important and well understood criterion for promoting a lower thrombosis rate. These hemo- and biocompatible properties, along with high strength, chemical inertness and durability provide graphene with an edge over most antithrombogenic coatings for biomedical implants and devices.									30	0	0	11	0	30			2046-2069			WOS:000313513400005

Indirubin-3 '-(2,3 dihydroxypropyl)-oximether (E804) is a potent modulator of LPS-stimulated macrophage functions								TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY				266	1			157	166		10.1016/j.taap.2012.10.011			JAN 1 2013	2013	Indirubin is a deep-red bis-indole isomer of indigo blue, both of which are biologically active ingredients in Danggui Longhui Wan, an ancient Chinese herbal tea mixture used to treat neoplasia and chronic inflammation and to enhance detoxification of xenobiotics. Multiple indirubin derivatives have been synthesized and shown to inhibit cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and glycogen-synthase kinase (GSK-3 beta) with varying degrees of potency. Several indirubins are also aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonists, with AhR-associated activities covering a wide range of potencies, depending on molecular structure. This study examined the effects of indirubin-3'-(2,3 dihydroxypropyl)-oximether (E804), a novel indirubin with potent STAT3 inhibitory properties, on basal and LPS-inducible activities in murine RAW264.7 macrophages. Using a focused commercial qRT-PCR array platform (SuperArray (R)), the effects of E804 on expression of a suite of genes associated with stress and toxicity were determined. Most genes up-regulated by LPS treatment were suppressed by E804; including LPS-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and receptors, apoptosis control genes, and oxidative stress response genes. Using qRT-PCR as a follow up to the commercial arrays, E804 treatment suppressed LPS-induced COX-2, iNOS, IL-6 and IL-10 gene expression, though the effects on iNOS and COX-2 protein expression were less dramatic. E804 also inhibited LPS-induced secretion of IL-6 and IL-10. Functional endpoints, including iNOS and lysozyme enzymatic activity, phagocytosis of fluorescent latex beads, and intracellular killing of bacteria, were also examined, and in each experimental condition E804 suppressed activities. Collectively, these results indicate that E804 is a potent modulator of pro-inflammatory profiles in LPS-treated macrophages. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Tissue specimens were removed from the belly region of porcine AVs and subsequently treated with either an enzyme solution for GAG removal or a control (buffer with no enzyme) solution. A dual stress level test methodology was used to determine the effects at low and high (physiological) stress levels. In addition, planar biaxial tests were conducted both on-axis (i.e. aligned to the circumferential and radial axes) and at 45 degrees off-axis to induce maximum shear, to explore the effects of augmented fiber rotations on the fiber-fiber interactions. Changes in hysteresis were used as the primary metric of GAG functional assessment. A simulation of the low-force experimental setup was also conducted to clarify the internal stress system and provide viscoelastic model parameters for this loading range. Results indicated that under planar tension the removal of GAGs had no measureable affect extensional mechanical properties (either on- or 45 degrees off-axis), including peak stretch, hysteresis and creep. Interestingly, in the low-force range, hysteresis was markedly reduced, from 35.96 +/- 2.65% in control group to 25.00 +/- 1.64% (p < 0.001) as a result of GAG removal. Collectively, these results suggest that GAGs do not play a direct role in modulating the time-dependent tensile properties of valvular tissues. Rather, they appear to be strongly connected with fiber-fiber and fiber-matrix interactions at low force levels. Thus, we speculate that GAGs may be important in providing a damping mechanism to reduce leaflet flutter when the leaflet is not under high tensile stress. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc.

J	Gartner, William B.								Creating a community of difference in entrepreneurship scholarship								ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT				25	1-2	SI		5	15		10.1080/08985626.2012.746874			JAN 1 2013	2013	This article argues for alternative forms of inquiry for exploring aspects of entrepreneurship scholarship that are often unseen, ignored or minimized. The label, The European School of Entrepreneurship, might serve as a useful rubric for identifying a community of scholars with tendencies towards the following: (1) an interest in the history of ideas that inform entrepreneurship scholarship, (2) a willingness to step outside of the entrepreneurship field, itself, to embrace a variety of ideas, particularly from philosophy and the humanities and (3) a concern for the other, so as to challenge the unspoken and often unrecognized taken-for-granted aspects of what entrepreneurship is and what it might be. Such tendencies are fundamentally different by degree (rather than contrast) from current norms; yet, these tendencies can make a significant difference in current scholarly practice in entrepreneurship, as well as our understanding of the entrepreneurial phenomenon.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0898-5626	1464-5114		WOS:000313415800002		
J	Jiang, Guangyu; Chen, Luxin; He, Jian; Gao, Hongli; Du, Zhengliang; Zhao, Xinbing; Tritt, Terry M.; Zhu, Tiejun								Improving p-type thermoelectric performance of Mg-2(Ge,Sn) compounds via solid solution and Ag doping								INTERMETALLICS				32				312	317		10.1016/j.intermet.2012.08.002			JAN 2013	2013	Mg2X (X = Si, Ge, and Sn) compounds have attracted increasing attention owing to their promising thermoelectric properties and "green" constituent elements. While most studies to date have been on ntype Mg-2(Si,Sn) solid solutions, we herein report Ag-doping study in Mg-2(Ge,Sn) solid solutions to pursue higher p-type performance. Two series of samples. Mg2Ge1-xSnx and Mg2-yAgyGe0.4Sn0.6, were prepared by melting in evacuated Ta tubes, followed by hot pressing, and the thermoelectric properties of the solid solutions were investigated from room temperature to 723 K. An n- to p-type crossover in the Seebeck coefficient was observed for Mg2Ge0.4Sn0.6 and Mg2Ge0.2Sn0.8 at elevated temperatures. To enhance p-type performance, we doped Ag in Mg2Ge0.4Sn0.6 that exhibited lowest thermal conductivity among the Mg-2(Ge,Sn) solid solutions. It was found that (1) p-type behavior has been established in Mg2-yAgyGe0.4Sn0.6 (y = 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04) samples in the entire temperature range studied; and (2) the electrical conductivity increased with increasing Ag content until reaching the solution limit similar to 0.02. As a result, a dimensionless figure of merit ZT similar to 0.38 is attained for Mg1.98Ge0.4Sn0.6Ag0.02 at 675 K, which is one of the highest reported values in p-type Mg2X compounds.

A Social Exchange-Based Model of the Antecedents of Workplace Exclusion								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY				98	1			37	48		10.1037/a0030135			JAN 2013	2013	We conducted 2 studies of coworker dyads to test a theoretical model exploring why and under what circumstances employees are the targets of workplace exclusion. Adopting a victim precipitation perspective, we integrate belongingness and social exchange theories to propose that employees who display workplace incivility are distrusted and therefore are targets of workplace exclusion. Highlighting the importance of the context of the perpetrator-target relationship, we also find support for the postulation that this mediated relationship is strengthened when the target employee is perceived to be a weak exchange partner and is attenuated when he or she is viewed as a valuable exchange partner. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.									14	1	0	0	0	15			0021-9010			WOS:000313392600003	22985114

Blaming the Organization for Abusive Supervision: The Roles of Perceived Organizational Support and Supervisor's Organizational Embodiment								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY				98	1			158	168		10.1037/a0030687			JAN 2013	2013	Why do employees who experience abusive supervision retaliate against the organization? We apply organizational support theory to propose that employees hold the organization partly responsible for abusive supervision. Depending on the extent to which employees identify the supervisor with the organization (i.e., supervisor's organizational embodiment), we expected abusive supervision to be associated with low perceived organizational support (POS) and consequently with retribution against the organization. Across 3 samples, we found that abusive supervision was associated with decreased POS as moderated by supervisor's organizational embodiment. In turn, reduced POS was related to heightened counterproductive work behavior directed against the organization and lowered in-role and extra-role performance. These findings suggest that employees partly attribute abusive supervision to negative valuation by the organization and, consequently, behave negatively toward and withhold positive contributions to it.									33	2	0	0	0	35			0021-9010			WOS:000313392600012	23205496	
J	Kim, Hakseo; Lee, Soon-Jae; Amirkhanian, Serji N.; Jeong, Kyu-Dong								Quantification of Oxidative Aging of Polymer-Modified Asphalt Mixes Made with Warm Mix Technologies								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING				25	1			1	8		10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0000479			JAN 2013	2013	This research investigates the oxidative aging levels of polymer-modified asphalt (PMA) mixes using gel permeable chromatography (GPC), which can help to simplify the quantification of asphalt aging. Warm-mix asphalt (WMA) technologies, namely, Aspha-min and Sasobit, were especially adapted to the PMA mixes for the purpose of the aging reduction. A short-term oven aging (STOA) procedure was used under 135 and 154 C for 2 and 4 h, respectively, to simulate the asphalt binders aged during the field operations (i.e., production, hauling, and paving construction). The aging levels were analyzed based on large molecular size (LMS) of the binders extracted from the mixes. A rolling thin-film oven (RTFO) method was also utilized using PMA binders containing those WMA additives under 135 and 163 C for 85 minutes for comparison purposes. The results showed that (1) aging time and temperature were important parameters to influence the aging; (2) the STOA procedure had a higher aging level than the RTFO method, which could be influenced by thin film thickness on aggregates; (3) the use of WMA technologies was effective to reduce the aging level of PMA mixes; and (4) it was possible to quantify the oxidative aging of PMA mixes [both hot-mix asphalt (HMA) and WMA] using the GPC technique.
