Gene Expression Omnibus														2011-12-14	2009	The present study investigated arsenics effects on mummichogs (Fundulus heteroclitus), while also examining what role that gender or age of exposure might play. Adult male and female mummichogs were exposed to 172ppb, 575ppb, or 1,720ppb arsenic as sodium arsenite for 10 days immediately prior to spawning. No differences were noted in the number or viability of eggs between the groups, but there was a significant increase in deformities in the 1,720ppb arsenic exposure group. Total RNA from adult livers or 6-week-old juveniles was used to probe custom macroarrays for changes in gene expression. In females, 3% of the genes were commonly differentially expressed in the 172 and 575ppb exposure groups. In the males, between 1.1-3% of the differentially expressed genes were in common between the exposure groups. Several genes, including apolipoprotein, serum amyloid precursor, lysozyme, and tributyltin-binding protein, were commonly expressed in either a dose-responsive or dose-specific, but across genders, manner. These patterns of regulation were confirmed by QPCR. These findings will provide us with a better understanding of the effects of dose, gender, and exposure age on the response to arsenic.									0	0	0	0	0	0						DRCI:DATA2012107000393122

Gene Expression Omnibus														2011-12-14	2009	The transcriptome profiles for wild-type (plasmid-free) and recombinant (plasmid-bearing) Escherichia coli during well-controlled synchronized high-cell-density fed-batch cultures were analyzed by DNA microarrays. It was observed that the growth phase significantly affected the transcriptome profiles, and the transcriptome profiles were significantly different for the recombinant and wild-type cultures. The response of the wild-type and recombinant cultures to an isopropyl-1-thio-SS-D-galactopyranoside- (IPTG-) addition was examined, where IPTG induced recombinant protein production in the plasmid-bearing cultures. The IPTG-addition significantly altered the transcriptome response of the wild-type cultures entering the stationary phase. The IPTG-induced recombinant protein production resulted in a significant down-regulation of many energy synthesis genes (atp, nuo, cyo), as well as nearly all transcription- and translation-related genes (rpo, rpl, rpm, rps, rrf, rrl, rrs). Numerous phage (psp, hfl) and transposon-related genes (tra, ins) were significantly regulated in the recombinant cultures due to the IPTG-induction. These results indicate that the signaling mechanism, associated with the recombinant protein production, may induce a metabolic burden in the form of a phage defense mechanism. Taken together, these results indicated that recombinant protein production initiated a cascade of transcriptome responses that down-regulated the very genes needed to sustain productivity.<br />In this study, the transcriptome profiles for recombinant and wild-type E. coli cultures were compared. The recombinant and wild-type cultures were monitored during the exponential growth phase and as the cultures entered the stationary phase. Well-controlled fed-batch fermenters were used to synchronize the high-cell density cultures. E. coli MG1655 [pPROEx-CAT] and E. coli MG1655 (plasmid-free) were exposed to IPTG in the exponential phase, where chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) expression was induced in the plasmid-bearing cultures. Control cultures, not exposed to IPTG, were also examined. The gene expression profiles were determined using DNA microarrays. Recombinant protein production was shown to result in a metabolic burden due to significant down-regulation of the transcription, translation, and energy synthesis genes. This was the first comprehensive study that has examined the transcriptome of wild-type and recombinant cultures under the same set of conditions. This data indicated that one cannot merely extrapolate the behavior of recombinant cultures from wild-type culture data.									0	0	0	0	0	0						DRCI:DATA2012103000421951		
R	Harcum, Sarah W; Haddadin, Fu'ad T								GSE17507: Global transcriptome response of recombinant E. coli to heat-shock and dual heat-shock recombinant protein induction.								Gene Expression Omnibus														2011-12-14	2009	Recombinant Escherichia coli cultures are used to manufacture numerous therapeutic proteins and industrial enzymes, where many of these processes use elevated temperatures to induce recombinant protein production. The heat-shock response in wild-type E. coli has been well studied. In this study, the transcriptome profiles of recombinant E. coli subjected to a heat-shock and to a dual heat-shock recombinant protein induction were examined. Most classical heat-shock protein genes were identified as regulated in both conditions. The major transcriptome differences between the recombinant and reported wild-type cultures were heavily populated by hypothetical and putative genes, which indicates recombinant cultures utilize many unique genes to respond to a heat-shock. Comparison of the dual stressed culture data with literature recombinant protein induced culture data revealed numerous differences. The dual stressed response encompassed three major response patterns: induced-like, in-between, and greater than either individual stress response. Also, there were no genes that only responded to the dual stress. The most interesting difference between the dual stressed and induced cultures was the amino acid-tRNA gene levels. The amino acid-tRNA genes were elevated for the dual cultures compared to the induced cultures. Since tRNAs facilitate protein synthesis via translation, this observed increase in amino acid-tRNA transcriptome levels, in concert with elevated heat-shock chaperones, might account for improved productivities often observed for thermo-inducible systems. Most importantly, the response of the recombinant cultures to a heat-shock was more profound than wild-type cultures, and further, the response to recombinant protein induction was not a simple additive response of the individual stresses.<br />The objective of the present work is to gain a better understanding of the heat-shock response in recombinant cultures and how this response might impact recombinant protein production. To accomplish this objective, the transcriptome response of recombinant cultures subjected to a heat-shock and a dual heat-shock recombinant protein induction were analyzed. The transcriptome levels were determined using Affymetrix? E. coli Antisense DNA microarrays, such that the entire genome was evaluated. These two transcriptome responses were also compared to recombinant cultures at normal growth temperature that were not over-expressing the recombinant protein and a set of literature recombinant culture data that were chemically induced to over-express the recombinant protein. Additionally, the heat-shock response of the recombinant cultures was compared to the literature report of the heat-shock response in wild-type cultures. The results of the global transcriptome analysis demonstrated that recombinant cultures respond differently to a heat-shock stress than wild-type cultures, where the transcriptome response of the recombinant cultures is further modified by production of a recombinant protein.									0	0	0	0	0	0						DRCI:DATA2012103000422036		
R	Harcum, Sarah W; Haddadin, Fu'ad T								GSE17506: Serine hydroxamate and the transcriptome of high cell density recombinant E. coli MG1655.								Gene Expression Omnibus														2011-12-14	2009	For over 30 years, serine hydroxamate has been used to chemically stimulate a stringent response in Escherichia coli and other bacteria. These studies have elucidated numerous characteristics of the classical stringent response beyond the simple cellular response to an amino acid shortage, including phospholipid synthesis and protease up-regulation. In this study, the effects of a serine hydroxamate addition on high cell density recombinant E. coli were examined and compared to the effects of recombinant protein production to determine overlaps, as recombinant protein production stress has often been attributed to amino acid shortages. Both the transcriptome and growth characteristics were evaluated and compared. The serine hydroxamate addition profoundly decreased the culture growth rate, whereas, recombinant protein production did not. Conversely, the transcriptome profile of the recombinant E. coli cultures were relatively unaffected by the serine hydroxamate addition, yet recombinant protein production dramatically changed the transcriptome profile. A subset of the classical stringent response genes were effected by the serine hydroxamate addition, whereas, recombinant protein production regulated numerous classical stringent response genes; however, not all. The genes that were regulated by the serine hydroxamate addition include numerous fatty acid synthesis genes, in agreement with altered phospholipids synthesis reports. These results indicate that recombinant protein production and the stringent response have many overlapping responses; however, are far from identical.<br />It was hypothesized that recombinant protein production leads to a stringent response due to the high amino acid synthesis demands related to recombinant protein synthesis. A comparison of the transcriptomes during recombinant protein production and a chemical imposed stringent response would assist with determining what portion of the "metabolic burden" associated with recombinant protein production is due to amino acid shortages. In this study, the transcriptome profiles of recombinant E. coli were examined and compared for the three culture conditions: 1) Normal growth, no external stress; 2) L-serine hydroxamate addition (to mediate a stringent response); and 3) IPTG-induction to produce the recombinant protein chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). The transcriptome profiles from these three conditions were analyzed using Affymetrix Anti-sense E. coli GeneChip microarrays.									0	0	0	0	0	0						DRCI:DATA2012103000422006

R	Harcum, Sarah W; Caldwell, Mary								GSE17495: Gene Expression in NS0 cells under ammonium stress.								Gene Expression Omnibus														2011-12-14	2009	Ammonium is a waste product that inhibits cell growth, recombinant protein production, and protein glycosylation in mammalian cell culture. Recent studies have demonstrated that ammonium adversely affects glycosylation-related gene expression in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. However, since the CHO cell line species has not been fully sequenced, a glycosylation transcriptome analysis is not possible in this cell line. Therefore, to further understand the effects of ammonium on glycosylation-related gene expression, NS0 cells, a mouse myeloma cell line, were cultured under elevated ammonium. NS0 cells are similar to CHO cells, in that the NS0 cells are anchorage-independent and commonly used to commercially produce recombinant proteins. Additionally, DNA microarrays containing all known mouse glycosylation-related genes were available to be used to examine gene expression.<br />NS0 cells were cultured under normal (control), elevated ammonium, elevated salt, and elevated ammonium with proline. It was observed that the control and treatments culture growth rates were not significantly different; however, the final cell densities were significantly different. The DNA microarray data was analyzed using a Welch ANOVA test with a Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate correction for the multiple comparisons of the glycosylation-genes. No significant difference in gene expression levels between the four conditions examined were observed. The results of this study demonstrated that NS0 cells, at the gene expression level, are insensitive to ammonium. Thus, the decreased glycosylation observed in NS0 cell cultures at elevated ammonium is likely due to changes in synthesis and degradation enzyme activity. In contrast, CHO cells have decreased glycosylation levels due to decreased sialytransferase gene expression and not increased degradation enzyme activity. Therefore, even though NS0 and CHO cells are both commonly used recombinant hosts for glycoprotein synthesis, it appears that NS0 and CHO cells had different control mechanisms respect to glycosylation-related gene expression under elevated ammonium.									0	0	0	0	0	0						DRCI:DATA2012103000421323

When to Spray: a Time-Scale Calculus Approach to Controlling the Impact of West Nile Virus								ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY				14	2					21				2009	2009	West Nile Virus (WNV) made its initial appearance in the New York City (NYC) metropolitan area in 1999 and was implicated in cases of human encephalitis and the extensive mortality in crows (Corvus sp.) and other avian species. Mosquitoes were found to be the primary vectors and NYC's current policy on control strategies involved an eradication program that depends on the synchronicity of the summer mosquito population's increases with the occurrence of cases in humans. The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether this is the most effective control strategy because past mathematical models assumed discrete behavior that is modeled by difference equations for a single summer season was most important to the virus's life cycle. However, both surviving mosquito eggs and surviving migratory birds incubate the virus during the winter, leading to a continuation of infections in the following warmer spring and summer when the birds return and the eggs hatch. Additionally, the virulence of WNV has been observed to fluctuate with changes in temperature toward warmer conditions. Models are required that account for these multi-seasonal dynamics and time-scale calculus is a newly developed method for resolving the behavior of systems that exhibit both discrete and continuous behavior. We found that, although the static states of the new temperature delay model are no different from older models, simulations indicate that the rate of the infection is affected by avian recovery at a lower temperature threshold. Consequently, eradication strategies should consider that controlling mosquitoes during the fall when colder temperatures occur would cause a fast and efficient drop to a disease-free state. This could prove rather more effective than mosquito control in the warmer months.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1708-3087			WOS:000278707200001

Electrolyte Conductivity Through the Shell of the Eastern Oyster Using a Four-Electrode Measurement								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				156	12			P169	P176		10.1149/1.3230623			2009	2009	The bioceramic shell of the Eastern oyster was investigated to determine its physical and chemical compositions. Resistance and electrolyte conductivity measurements through the shell using a four-electrode cell configuration were made. The scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive spectroscopy analysis of oyster shell cross sections revealed that this multilayered biocomposite material is composed of numerous incongruent "chalky" and "nonchalky" layers, each containing similar chemical elements but having different overall chemical compositions and porosities, with the chalky layers being quite porous and voluminous, whereas the nonchalky layers appear to be nonporous, more dense, and compact. The electrolyte conductivity within the pores of the shell was dependent on the ionic concentration of the electrolyte, suggesting that the tortuosity across the shell material via the various chalky and nonchalky layers has an effect on the transport of ions. Rather, consideration of the data in terms of the space charge model indicates that the surface charges within the porous biocomposite facilitate the conduction of ions, much like a ceramic membrane. These findings suggest that the oyster shell may function not only as a protective physical structure, but also as a ceramic membrane allowing for the exchange of ions from the external environment.

J	Zabrucky, Karen M.; Agler, Lin-Miao L.; Moore, DeWayne								Metacognition in Taiwan: Students' calibration of comprehension and performance								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY				44	4			305	312		10.1080/00207590802315409			2009	2009	Researchers have increasingly investigated the role played by metacognition in students' learning and performance. Metacognition is comprised of metacognitive knowledge and metacognitive experiences, and both components of metacognition are viewed as being important to learning and performance in academic settings. Metacognitive experiences involve, in part, students' awareness of progress on cognitive tasks. Such awareness is critical to learning, for students may fail to spend additional time reviewing or studying material if they believe they have understood the material adequately. In the present study we examined Taiwanese students' ability to assess their comprehension of passages following reading as well as their ability to predict the number of questions they would be able to answer about passage content. Following an actual test on the material, students were asked to assess how many questions they felt they answered correctly about a passage (postdiction). Students were able to predict comprehension and test performance at better than chance levels and were more accurate at postdiction than prediction. Students with better performance, as measured by comprehension test scores, were better at both prediction and postdiction of comprehension performance. However, students' self-assessments of general calibration ability did not relate to their test performance. The metacomprehension skills of Taiwanese students were quite similar to those previously found for western students, but also diverged in some respects.									4	0	0	1	0	4			0020-7594			WOS:000270566800008	22029559

We consider d-linear approximation spaces on a uniform rectangular mesh, but our results can be extended to smoothly varying rectangular meshes. Using a blending or Boolean interpolation, we obtain a superconvergence error estimate in a discrete energy norm and an optimal-order error estimate in a semi-discrete norm for the parabolic equation. The L-2-optimality for the elliptic problem follows directly from the parabolic estimates. Numerical results are provided to validate our theoretical estimates. We also discuss the impact of penalty parameters on convergence behaviors of NIPG. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									7	1	0	0	0	8			0045-7825			WOS:000266297300012

Currently, hemlock stands in the southeast US are on the leading edge of the infestation. This study investigated HWA distributions in the Chattooga River watershed, and examined relationships between site and stand variables and hemlock susceptibility to HWA attack. The following variables were examined: latitude, longitude, elevation, slope, aspect, terrain shape index (TSI), landform index (LFI), percent infestation, quadratic mean diameter, total basal area (BA), hemlock BA, non-hemlock BA, hemlock BA(%), non-hemlock BA(%), and tree height. Multiple regression with backward selection showed statistically significant relationships of HWA infestation to latitude (P = 0.0006), longitude (P < 0.0001), and TSI (P = 0.0316). The proximity of a hemlock stand to existing HWA infestations appears to be the primary factor influencing its susceptibility to attack.									5	0	0	5	0	5			1528-7092			WOS:000265655600012

Here the authors report the development of a selectively semipermeable hollow fiber culture system that more accurately mimics the in vivo microenvironment experienced by mammalian distal airway cells than in conventional or standard air-liquid interface culture. Murine lung epithelial cells (MLE-15) were cultured within semipermeable polyurethane hollow fibers and introduced to controlled airflow through the microfiber interior. Under these conditions, MLE-15 cells formed confluent monolayers, demonstrated a cuboidal morphology, formed tight junctions, and produced and secreted surfactant proteins. Numerous lamellar bodies and microvilli were present in MLE-15 cells grown in hollow fiber culture. Conversely, these alveolar type II cell characteristics were reduced in MLE-15 cells cultured in conventional 2D static culture systems. These data support the hypothesis that MLE-15 cells grown within our microfiber culture system in the presence of airflow maintain the phenotypic characteristics of type II cells to a higher degree than those grown in standard in vitro cell culture models. Application of our novel model system may prove advantageous for future studies of specific gene and protein expression involving alveolar epithelial or bronchiolar epithelial cells.									9	0	0	8	0	9			0190-2148			WOS:000263870100005	19263283

In this study we demonstrate generation of singlet oxygen and other radical species upon exposure of quantum dots to blue light and therapeutic red light. Extent of radical production can be readily modified by antioxidants. Lay and scientific communities are two sites concerning potential hazards and enthusiastic applications of nanotechnology. Synthesis of quantum dots composed of less toxic materials is of great interest.

The analysis of the X-ray absorption edges indicates that some electronic differences may indeed exist in the state of Pt supported on the Ce-KL compared to that on the unpromoted KL zeolite. Although the Pt particle size and location inside the zeolite is very similar in the two zeolites, the presence of the Ce seems to have influence on the electronic potential around Pt, which may be responsible for the observed enhanced stabilization of the small metal clusters. The presence of Ce in the zeolite also greatly affects the reducibility of Pt.					14th International Conference on X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS14)14th International Conference on X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS14)	JUL 26-31, 2009JUL 26-31, 2009		Camerino, ITALYCamerino, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0	0			1742-6588		*****************	WOS:000275152100165

Document indexing is the key to search performance. However, it is challenging to guarantee high search performance with small document index. In this paper, we present iSearch which aims to build small document index to deliver high search performance on Gnutella-like P2P networks. The number of index terms per document is typically 4, which dramatically reduces associated cost in index storage and dissemination. iSearch explores two options to build index: top term-based indexing (TTI) and query-driven indexing (QDI). TTI bases selection of document index terms on term statistics, while QDI progressively refines document index by past queries. Our simulations show that that TTI and QDI improve search performance over random walk significantly. By dynamically adapting index based on past queries, QDI outperforms TTI greatly, by up to 2x recall improvement.					16th International Conference on High Performance Computing (HiPC 2009)16th International Conference on High Performance Computing (HiPC 2009)	DEC 16-19, 2009DEC 16-19, 2009	IEEE Comp Soc TCCP; HiPC Educ Trust; AMC SIGARCHIEEE Comp Soc TCCP; HiPC Educ Trust; AMC SIGARCH	Kochi, INDIAKochi, INDIA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4244-4921-7	WOS:000278129300033

In spite of the significant dependency of consistency maintenance on file replication, there has been little file replication research devoted to tackling the dependency issue. Most traditional file replication protocols focus on improving file lookup efficiency without considering the subsequent consistency maintenance. This paper presents a COoperative file Replication Protocol (CORP). CORP observes a set of factors including file update rate, file popularity, node available capacity, file load and node locality that affect the efficiency of consistency maintenance. It considers these factors to achieve high efficiency not only in file replication but also in consistency maintenance. CORP generates less replicas and optimally chooses infrequently-updated or popular files to replicate. In addition, it makes file replicas in physically close nodes. Further, CORP can dynamically adjust the number of replicas based on ever-changing file popularity and visit pattern. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of CORP in comparison with other file replication protocols. It dramatically reduces the overhead of both file replication and consistency maintenance. Moreover, it yields significant improvement in reducing overloaded nodes.					16th International Conference on High Performance Computing (HiPC 2009)16th International Conference on High Performance Computing (HiPC 2009)	DEC 16-19, 2009DEC 16-19, 2009	IEEE Comp Soc TCCP; HiPC Educ Trust; AMC SIGARCHIEEE Comp Soc TCCP; HiPC Educ Trust; AMC SIGARCH	Kochi, INDIAKochi, INDIA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4244-4921-7	WOS:000278129300034

We present a novel synergy-based approach for operator interfaces, by introducing a series of octopus-arm inspired grasp-synergies. These grasp-synergies automatically coordinate the degrees of freedom of the continuum manipulator, allowing an operator to perform kinematically complex grasping motions through simple and intuitive joystick inputs. This effectively reduces the complexity of operation and allows the operator to devote more of his attention to higher-level concerns (e.g. goal, environment). We demonstrate the grasp-synergies interface design in both simulation and hardware using the nine degree of freedom Octarm continuum manipulator.

A piezoelectrically-driven nanopositioning stage with high resolution capacitive position sensor is utilized in a set of experiments to study the performance of controllers tuned for tracking of continuous trajectories in tracking of stepped trajectories, and vice versa. Using a mixed Lyapunov-based robust adaptive and PID controller, it is observed that the controllers tuned for continuous trajectory tracking demonstrate large oscillations with light damping rate in tracking of stepped inputs. Conversely, when they are tuned for smoother step tracking, poor performance is achieved in tracking of continuous trajectories within a desired frequency range. Hence, a switching strategy is proposed to track desired trajectories using two controllers separately tuned for continuous and stepped trajectories.

For this, the governing equation of motion of a vertical PFM is derived at a given point on the sample. Using the expansion theorem, the governing ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of the system and their state-space representation are derived under applied external voltage. For the proof of the concept, the results obtained from both frequency and step responses of a PFM experiment are utilized to simultaneously identify the microcantilever parameters along with local spring constant and piezoelectric coefficient of a Periodically Poled Lithium Niobate (PPLN) sample. In this regard, a new parameter estimation strategy is developed for modal identification of system parameters under general frequency response. Results indicate good agreements between the identified model and the experimental data using the proposed modeling and identification framework.

The first FDI approach uses parity equations to decouple the two types of faults, while at the same time, minimizes the influence of the disturbance on the residuals. The second FDI method uses sliding mode observer design, and by monitoring the equivalent control of the observers, in which the fault information is contained, achieves the detection and isolation of the faults. Lane change maneuvers are simulated, and the results showed that, under the given simulation condition, both diagnostic approaches can successfully detect and isolate the two types of faults despite the existence of a lateral wind gust disturbance.

This paper presents and compares two strategies for online trajectory generation in the control of such a robotic paint curing system. The system proposed here incorporates thermal vision feedback from an infra-red (IR) camera to ensure cure quality in the face of changing surface geometries and irradiance characteristics. To compare the two proposed strategies a computer simulation of the robotic curing system is developed. The results indicate that both strategies give comparable cure quality in the face of uneven target characteristics.

Bioprinting technology can aid in the difficult task of arranging live mammalian cells and biomaterials in viable structures for tissue engineering purposes. This paper describes a system, based on HP26 series print cartridge technology, capable of precisely depositing multiple cell types in precise patterns. The paper discusses the research, design, and implementation of the printing system, which permits control of droplet firing parameters, including firing energy, speed, and spacing. The results demonstrate the system's fine patterning ability of viable cells, including two-dimensional patterned co-cultures of two cell types. The system has been specifically designed with the flexibility to be extended to print more than two cell types and/or materials simultaneously and to layer printed patterns to form three-dimensional constructs. With these features, the printing system will serve as the foundation for a biofabrication system capable of three-dimensional cell co-cultures, i.e. tissue test systems.

The target is represented by a Gaussian mixture model in a joint feature-spatial space, with each ellipsoid corresponding to a different fragment. The fragments are automatically adapted to the image data, being selected by an efficient region-growing procedure and updated according to a weighted average of the past and present image statistics. Modeling of target and background are performed in a Chan-Vese manner, using the framework of level sets to preserve accurate boundaries of the target. The extracted target boundaries are used to learn the dynamic shape of the target over time, enabling tracking to continue under total occlusion. Experimental results on a number of challenging sequences demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique.					12th IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision12th IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision	SEP 29-OCT 02, 2009SEP 29-OCT 02, 2009	IEEE; IEEE Comp SocIEEE; IEEE Comp Soc	Kyoto, JAPANKyoto, JAPAN	39	0	0	2	0	39			1550-5499		978-1-4244-4419-9	WOS:000294955300197

Contrary to other low data rate wireless sensor networks, the highway sensor network is expected to carry rich media (e.g., video) with high throughput and low latency requirements. While line power is potentially available at selected locations of selected highways, it is expected most sensors will be individually solar-powered to enable practical implementation at large scales and flexible locations. The paper presents a set of centralized and distributed slotted transmission scheduling methods for IEEE 802.11 based sensor platforms. The methods divide sensors into groups based on their deployed road segment and optimize the bidirectional relay throughput, delay, and energy efficiency for each segment. The approach conforms well to the prevalent practice of placing traffic controllers at regular intersections. Based on local network topology, the methods utilize controllers to coordinate sensor transmission time slots with a pipelined, rotational, and load weighted approach. Simulations in ns-2 showed 20-40% higher throughput, 65-90% less energy, and similar delays compared to unscheduled IEEE 802.11 mesh networks. With multi-intersection coordination, we show that the distributed method was able to achieve 96% of the centralized method's throughput at much lesser communication overheads.

To assess the feasibility and reliability of a given end-to-end communication need, it is essential for communication end points to accurately estimate their achievable end-to-end throughput. Several capacity, end-to-end throughput, and available bandwidth estimation techniques have been studied in the past for wired and wireless networks. The contention among wireless nodes arising due to the IEEE 802.11 medium access control protocol's channel access mechanism renders the estimation of such network attributes challenging in multi-hop networks. This paper evaluates one state-of-the-art capacity estimation approach for ad hoc wireless networks and shows that it in fact measures achievable throughput instead of capacity and its estimated achievable throughput is not realizable. An analysis of end-to-end delays of injected probe packets is presented to show the effects of medium access contention and network queuing on the delays and estimated achievable throughput subject to different network traffic patterns and multi-hop collisions. Based on the observations, an alternative less intrusive delay distribution based achievable throughput estimation solution is proposed. With ns-2 simulation, the scheme was shown to accurately estimate the achievable throughput under various cross traffic conditions.

This application has been penetrating wireless mobile networks with dramatic speed, which allows the sharing of data whenever and wherever. However, traditional client-server data sharing model suffers from single point failure and low-scalable transmission in a highly dense and dynamic scenario. MANET is a promising alternative structure for flexible and distributed data sharing. However, the topology-based flooding employed in MANETs for data routing and querying prevents the data sharing system from achieving high scalability and robustness. Building a DHT on a MANET reduces data query overhead, but the inconsistency between the overlay and the underlying topology degrade system's performance. Geographic routing based data sharing in MANETs reduces the data routing overhead. However, it has more requirements (e.g. GPS) on the nodes. This paper presents a LOcality-based distRibuted Data sharing system (LORD) for mobility and congestion resilient data management. LORD consists of a DHT-based data index and retrieval protocol and a locality-aware region-based data routing protocol. It provides highly efficient, scalable and dynamism-resilient data sharing with low overhead. Moreover, it offers similarity data searching function. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show the superiority of LORD compared with other data sharing systems in terms of scalability, overhead and dynamism-resilience in a highly dense and dynamic MANET.					6th International Conference on Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems6th International Conference on Mobile Adhoc and Sensor Systems	OCT 12-15, 2009OCT 12-15, 2009		Macau, PEOPLES R CHINAMacau, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4244-5114-2	WOS:000288888800109

The hybrid AMGA proposed in this paper is a combination of a classical gradient based single-objective optimization algorithm and an evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm. The gradient based optimizer is used for a fast local search and is a variant of the sequential quadratic programming method. The Matlab implementation of the SQP (provided by the fmincon optimization function) is used in this paper. The evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm AMGA is used as the global optimizer. A scalarization scheme based on the weighted objectives is proposed which is designed to facilitate the simultaneous improvement of all the objectives. The scalarization scheme proposed in this paper also utilizes reference points as constraints to enable the algorithm to solve non-convex optimization problems. The gradient based optimizer is used as the mutation operator of the evolutionary algorithm and a suitable scheme to switch between the genetic mutation and the gradient based mutation is proposed. The hybrid AMGA is designed to balance local versus global search strategies so as to obtain a set of diverse non-dominated solutions as quickly as possible. The simulation results of the hybrid AMGA are reported on the bound-constrained test problem described in the CEC09 benchmark suite.

The device can count the total number of bites the user has taken, and provide the bites-taken rate (bites per minute) of the user. Experiments have been conducted to determine its accuracy. Ten subjects ate a meal of their choice, using utensils (or fingers) of their choice. Video was recorded of subjects eating, and synchronized with our device, in order to evaluate its performance. The sensitivity of the device was found to be 91%. Our methods could find use in a number of applications, including helping a user with obesity, eating disorders or eating rate problems.

The control design is complicated by considering parametric uncertainty in the dynamic modeling of the quadrotor aerial-robot. Robust control schemes are then designed using a Lyapunov-based approach to compensate for the unknown parameters in each dynamic subsystem model. Lyapunov-type stability analysis suggests a global uniform ultimately bounded (GUUB) tracking result.

This paper proposes a control strategy to maximize the wind energy captured in a variable speed wind turbine, with an internal induction generator, at low to medium wind speeds. The proposed strategy controls the tip speed ratio, via the rotor angular speed, to an optimum point at which the efficiency constant (or power coefficient) is maximal for a particular blade pitch angle and wind speed. This control method allows for aerodynamic rotor power maximization without exact wind turbine model knowledge.

The position of the moving platform is assumed to be measurable, and a second object with known 3D Euclidean coordinates relative to the world frame is considered to be available a priori. To account for the unknown camera calibration parameters and to estimate the unknown 3D Euclidean coordinates, an adaptive least squares estimation strategy is employed based on prediction error formulations and a Lyapunov-type stability analysis. The developed estimator is proven to recover the 3D Euclidean position of the unknown object features despite the lack of knowledge of the camera calibration parameters.

The position of the moving platform is assumed to be measurable. To identify the unknown range, first a function of the projected pixel coordinates is related to the unknown 3D Euclidean coordinates of an object feature. This function is nonlinearly parameterized (Le., the unknown parameters appear nonlinearly in the parameterized model). An adaptive estimator based on a min-max algorithm is then designed to estimate the unknown 3D Euclidean coordinates of an object feature relative to a fixed reference frame which facilitates the identification of range. A Lyapunov-type stability analysis is used to show that the developed estimator provides an estimation of the unknown parameters within a desired precision.

This paper documents a case study examining the development of a demonstration project intended to show the value of usability testing to a large textbook publishing house. It also demonstrates what can happen when complex tasks go masquerading inside a whole field as simple, linear problems. The paper illustrates how complex problems manifest themselves in a traditional usability study and how recognizing them affords researchers opportunities to serve a client's needs.

On the physical fabric, scalable tools that "push" configuration changes and software updates to the compute nodes are effective, since the physical system administrators have complete system access. However, virtual clusters executing atop federated Grid sites may not be directly reachable for management purposes, as network or policy limitations may prevent unsolicited connections to virtual compute nodes. For these systems, a distributed middleware solution could permit the compute nodes to "pull" updates from a centralized server, thereby permitting the management of virtual compute nodes that are inaccessible to the system administrator. This paper compares both models of system administration and describes emerging software utilities for managing both the physical fabric and the virtual clusters.					23rd IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium23rd IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium	MAY 23-29, 2009MAY 23-29, 2009	IEEEIEEE	Rome, ITALYRome, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0	0			1530-2075		978-1-4244-3751-1	WOS:000272993601151

Moreover, their environmental implications are highly geographically heterogeneous. Consequently, they present a significant challenge to existing life cycle assessment techniques. Four specific issues are identified in this paper: determining changes in land use due to increased production of renewable energy, characterizing land use impacts, understanding geographic variability in inventory data, and modeling energy distribution effects. This paper reviews the extent of recent research activity in each of these areas as it applies to wind, solar, bioenergy or life cycle assessment in general. Some areas, such as land use needed for distribution of wind or solar energy, have received little or no research activity, despite an increased level of concern in political or policy arenas. This deficiency will be addressed in a new National Science Foundation workshop planned for September 2009 in Boston MA.

Aiming to achieve high replica utilization and efficient file query with low overhead, this paper presents a file replication mechanism based on swarm intelligence, namely SWARM. Recognizing the power of collective behaviors, SWARM identifies node swarms with common node interests and close proximity. It determines the location of a file replica based on the accumulated query rates of nodes in a swarm. Replicas are shared by the nodes in a swarm, leading to less replicas and high query efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the SWARM mechanism in comparison with other file replication methods.					9th International Conference on Peer-to-Peer Computing9th International Conference on Peer-to-Peer Computing	SEP 09-11, 2009SEP 09-11, 2009	IEEEIEEE	Seattle, WASeattle, WA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4244-5066-4	WOS:000274540500029

Experimental data were acquired with a DGF-4C (XIA, Inc) system in list mode. Simulated time-interval data were obtained using Monte Carlo techniques to perform a random radiation sampling of the Poisson distribution. The three methods (SIT, SPRT_fixed and SPRT_scaled) were compared in terms of detection probability and average time to make a decision about the source of radiation. For both experimental and simulated data, SPRT_scaled provided similar detection probabilities as other tests, but is able to make a quicker decision with fewer pulses at relatively higher radiation levels. SPRT_scaled has a provision for varying the sampling time depending on the radiation level, which may further shorten the time needed for radiation monitoring. Parameter adjustments to the SPRT_scaled method for increased detection probability are discussed.

The recent Izhikevich spiking neuron model is ideally suited for such large scale cortical simulations due to its efficiency and biological accuracy. In this paper we explore the feasibility of using FPGAs for large scale simulations of the Izhikevich model. We developed a modularized processing element to evaluate a large number of Izhikevich spiking neurons in a pipelined manner. This approach allows for easy scalability of the model to larger FPGAs. We utilized a character recognition algorithm based on the Izhikevich model for this study and scaled up the algorithm to use over 9000 neurons. The FPGA implementation of the algorithm on a Xilinx Virtex 4 provided a speedup of approximately 8.5 times an equivalent software implementation on a 2.2 GHz AMD Opteron core. Our results indicate that FPGAs are suitable for large scale cortical simulations utilizing the Izhikevich spiking neuron model.

In this study, a new machine learning method has been developed for sequence-based prediction of protein stability changes upon single amino acid substitutions. Support vector machines were trained with data from experimental studies on the free energy change of protein stability upon mutations. To construct accurate classifiers, twenty biological features were examined for input vector encoding. It was shown that classifier performance varied significantly by the use of different features. The most accurate classifier was constructed using a combination of several biological features. This classifier achieved an overall accuracy of 82.24% with 75.24% sensitivity and 85.36% specificity. Predictive results at this level of accuracy may be used in human genetic studies to distinguish between deleterious and tolerant alterations in disease candidate genes.

However, PSSM is rather designed for PSI-BLAST searches, and it may not contain all the evolutionary information for modeling specific sequence patterns. In this study, several new descriptors of evolutionary information have been developed and evaluated for sequence-based prediction of DNA and RNA-binding residues using support vector machines (SVMs). The new descriptors were shown to improve classifier performance. Interestingly, the best classifiers were obtained by combining the new descriptors and PSSM, suggesting that they captured different aspects of evolutionary information for DNA and RNA-binding site prediction. The SVM classifiers achieved 77.3% sensitivity and 79.3% specificity for prediction of DNA-binding residues, and 71.6% sensitivity and 78.7% specificity for RNA-binding site prediction. Predictions at this level of accuracy may provide useful information for protein functional annotation, protein-nucleic acid docking and experimental studies such as site-directed mutagenesis.

IEEE					Review of Available Transmission Capability (ATC) Calculation Methods								2009 POWER SYSTEMS CONFERENCE								272	280					2009	2009	In last few years, transfer of bulk electrical power over long distances has increased in order to have a reliable and economical electrical supply. For example, hydroelectric power generated in Canada can be transferred to consumers and industry in United States using the high voltage transmission system. But only limited amount of power can be transferred over the transmission system subject to thermal limits of transmission lines, bus voltage limits, dynamic stability and voltage stability limits. The maximum power that can be transferred over the existing amount is called the available transfer capability. To operate the power system safely and to gain the benefits of the bulk power transfers, the transfer capabilities must be calculated and the power system planned and operated so that the power transfers do not exceed the transfer capability. The purpose of this paper is to explain concepts and calculation methods used to calculate available transfer capability and also discuss advantages and disadvantages of each. The methods reviewed in this paper are based on DC and AC Power Transfer Distribution Factors (PTDF), Continuation Power Flow (CPF) and repeated AC Power Flow. Simulation results are presented for each method on IEEE 6-bus and 39-bus system.

The purpose of this study was to determine the relative performance characteristics of each of these classes. In addition, we compared two types of data representations to determine whether these selection techniques were suitable for interaction in different environments. The techniques were evaluated in terms of accuracy, completion times, TLX overall workload, TLX physical demand, and TLX cognitive demand.Our results suggest that symmetric and synchronous selection strategies both contribute to faster task completion. Our results also indicate that no class of bimanual selection was a significant contributor to reducing or increasing physical demand, while asynchronous action significantly increased cognitive demand in asymmetric techniques and decreased ease of use in symmetric techniques. However, for users with greater computer usage experience, accuracy performance differences diminished between the classes of bimanual action. No significant differences were found between the two types of data representations.

Hybrid Image/Model-Based Gaze-Contingent Rendering								ACM TRANSACTIONS ON APPLIED PERCEPTION				5	4					22	10.1145/1462048.1462053			JAN 2009	2009	A nonisotropic hybrid image/model-based gaze-contingent rendering technique utilizing ray casting on a GPU is discussed. Empirical evidence derived from human subject experiments indicates an inverse relationship between a peripherally degraded scene's high-resolution inset size and mean search time, a trend consistent with existing image-based and model-based techniques. In addition, the data suggest that maintaining a target's silhouette edges decreases search times when compared to targets with degraded edges. However, analysis suggests a point of diminishing returns with an inset larger than 15 degrees when target discrimination is a component of visual search. Benefits of the hybrid technique include simplicity of design and parallelizability, both conducive to GPU implementation.

The Ru atom in this complex is best described as having a considerably distorted octahedral coordination environment with the arene occupying three coordination sites. Two further coordination sites are occupied by chloride and bromide ligands, while the sixth site is occupied by the carbene. The carbene portion of the ligand is a benzimidazole ring. This ring is connected to the C6H4C(CH3)(3) arene by a CH2 bridge. This leads to a system with very little apparent strain. The two halogen atoms are disordered between Br and Cl. Two partial Cl atoms share the same sites as two partial Br atoms so that the title compound effectively has one Cl and one Br atom.

But the reaction time has been slow; the systems that realize this transformation are notoriously difficult to implement. Experiential evidence indicates that wireless link quality variation ill both the spatial and temporal dimensions is partially to blame. In short, it is difficult to realize reliable networks using unreliable links that fluctuate in quality over space and time.Here we present a software-centric approach to reducing the impact of wireless link quality variation in embedded networks, with a focus oil wireless sensor networks, We present an alternative radio stack implementation for TinyOS, the emerging operating system standard. The implementation is adaptive, masking packet loss over medium- to high-quality links, while identifying and avoiding transmissions over low-quality links. The impact is a simplification of the link quality spectrum: designers contend only with high-quality links; irreparable links are marked as (lead. We evaluate the performance of the alternative relative to its TinyOS Counterpart oil a network of 80 wireless nodes. Three representative evaluation contexts are considered: (i) neighbor-to-neighbor, (ii) distributed convergecast, and (iii) distributed divergecast.					3rd International Workshop on Dependable Embedded Systems3rd International Workshop on Dependable Embedded Systems	OCT 01, 2006OCT 01, 2006		Leeds, ENGLANDLeeds, ENGLAND	0	0	0	0	0	0			1551-9899	1552-0633		WOS:000263985500001

The problem is decomposed into several simpler subproblems. First, this paper presents a solution to the inverse kinematics problem for a single-section trunk. Assuming endpoints for all sections of a multi-section trunk are known, this paper then details applying single-section inverse kinematics to each section of the multi-section trunk by compensating for the resulting changes in orientation. Finally, an approach which computes per-section endpoints given only a final-section endpoint provides a complete solution to the multi-section inverse kinematics problem. The results of implementing these algorithms in simulation and on a prototype continuum robot are presented and possible applications discussed.

According to the proposed theory, employee perceptions involving the procedural and distributive justice of the gain-sharing plan influence employee trust in managers. Positive perceptions of fairness lead to high trust, which, in turn has positive consequences for the organization such as lower employee turnover. To investigate these issues, a survey was administered to employees of a large manufacturing company. Results of structural equation modeling indicate that employee perceptions regarding the fairness of the gain-sharing plan are positively related to employee trust in managers. Further, trust is linked to employee turnover intentions. The results imply that the organizational justice of an MCS has consequences for the attitudes and behaviors of employees and thus the success or failure of the MCS.									2	0	1	0	0	2					978-1-84855-738-3	WOS:000270894800001

We find that student reading assignments on earnings management and professionalism topics followed by individual testing do not alter student-reported beliefs. However, when the same students process and report their beliefs about earnings management practices in a group setting, the results are different from their initially reported individual beliefs. These statistically significant results suggest that a group dynamic that involves students in the learning process, may be effective in influencing the ethical judgments and perceptions of our future business professionals.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1085-4622		978-1-84855-882-3	WOS:000270576100006

Several biologically relevant features, including biochemical properties of amino acid residues and evolutionary information of protein sequences, were selected for input encoding. The evolutionary information was represented as position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) and several new descriptors developed in this study. The sequence-derived features were then used to train random forests (RFs), which could handle a large number of input variables and avoid model overrating. The use of evolutionary information together with biochemical features was found to significantly improve classifier performance. The RE classifier was further evaluated using a separate test dataset. The results suggest that the RF-based approach gives rise to more accurate prediction of DNA-binding residues than previous studies.					2nd International Conference on Future Generation Communication and Networking2nd International Conference on Future Generation Communication and Networking	DEC 13-15, 2008DEC 13-15, 2008	IEEEIEEE	Hainan, PEOPLES R CHINAHainan, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0			1865-0929		978-3-642-10237-0	WOS:000280184400015

The presence of six phenolic hydroxyl groups and two aldehydic groups makes gossypol chemically reactive. Gossypol can undergo Schiff base formation, ozonolysis, oxidation, and methylation to form gossypol derivatives. Gossypol and its derivatives have been the target of much research due to their multifaceted biological activities including antifertility, antivirus, anticancer, antioxidant, antitrypanosomal, antimicrobial, and antimalarial activities. Because of restricted rotation of the internaphthyl bond, gossypol is a chiral compound, which has two atropisomers (i.e., (+)- and (-)-gossypol) that exhibit different levels of biological activities. This chapter covers the physiochemical properties, analyses, biological properties, and agricultural and clinical implications of gossypol.									32	1	0	26	0	33			1043-4526		978-0-08-092237-9	WOS:000310873800006	19878861

In this paper, we present the strategy used at Clemson University to deploy and maintain a grid infrastructure by making resources available to both local and federated remote users for scientific research. Virtually no compute cycles are wasted. Usage trends and power consumption statistics collected from the Clemson campus grid are used as a reference for best-practices. After several years of cyber-evolution, the loosely-coupled components that comprise the campus grid work together to form a highly cohesive infrastructure that not only meets the computing needs of local users, but also helps to fill the needs of the scientific community at large. Experience gained from the deployment and management of this system may be adapted to other grid sites, allowing for the development of campus-wide, grid-connected cyberinfrastructures.					4th International Conference on Grid and Pervasive Computing4th International Conference on Grid and Pervasive Computing	MAY 04-08, 2009MAY 04-08, 2009		Geneva, SWITZERLANDGeneva, SWITZERLAND	0	0	0	0	0	0			0302-9743		978-3-642-01670-7	WOS:000266631800016

A solution that is based on a lattice-Boltzmann method is suggested. Reflectance, transmittance, and absorptance parameters are taken from measurements of real plants and integrated into a parameterized, dynamic global illumination model. When the model is combined with fast shadow rays, traced on a CPU. near real-time cinematic relighting is achievable for forest scenes containing hundreds of millions of polygons.					5th International Symposium on Visual Computing5th International Symposium on Visual Computing	NOV 30-DEC 02, 2009NOV 30-DEC 02, 2009	UNR Comp Vis Lab; Desert Res Inst; Berkeley Lab; NASA; intel; digitalPersona; EQUINOX; hp; Ford; Mitsubishi; GE; iCORE; Delphi Toyota; VOLT; MSDN MagazineUNR Comp Vis Lab; Desert Res Inst; Berkeley Lab; NASA; intel; digitalPersona; EQUINOX; hp; Ford; Mitsubishi; GE; iCORE; Delphi Toyota; VOLT; MSDN Magazine	Las Vegas, NVLas Vegas, NV	0	0	0	0	0	0			0302-9743		978-3-642-10330-8	WOS:000278937300006

With this method we can approximate ambient occlusion or rendering volumetric data with minimal additional cost over fast sweeping. We compare visualizations rendered with our algorithm to visualizations computed with only local shading, and with a ambient occlusion calculation using Monte Carlo sampling method. We also show how this method can be used for approximating low frequency shadows and subsurface scattering.					5th International Symposium on Visual Computing5th International Symposium on Visual Computing	NOV 30-DEC 02, 2009NOV 30-DEC 02, 2009	UNR Comp Vis Lab; Desert Res Inst; Berkeley Lab; NASA; intel; digitalPersona; EQUINOX; hp; Ford; Mitsubishi; GE; iCORE; Delphi Toyota; VOLT; MSDN MagazineUNR Comp Vis Lab; Desert Res Inst; Berkeley Lab; NASA; intel; digitalPersona; EQUINOX; hp; Ford; Mitsubishi; GE; iCORE; Delphi Toyota; VOLT; MSDN Magazine	Las Vegas, NVLas Vegas, NV	0	0	0	0	0	0			0302-9743		978-3-642-10330-8	WOS:000278937300016

To estimate the pose and viewpoint we introduce a novel motion descriptor that computes the spatial relationships of motion vectors representing various parts of the person using the trajectories of a number of sparse points. A nearest neighbor search for the closest motion descriptor from the labeled training data of human walking poses in multiple views is performed. This observational probability is fed to a Hidden Markov Model defined over multiple poses and viewpoints to obtain temporally consistent pose estimates. Experimental results on various sequences of walking subjects with multiple viewpoints demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. In particular, our purely not ion-based approach is able to track people even when other visible cues are not available, such as in low-light situations.					5th International Symposium on Visual Computing5th International Symposium on Visual Computing	NOV 30-DEC 02, 2009NOV 30-DEC 02, 2009	UNR Comp Vis Lab; Desert Res Inst; Berkeley Lab; NASA; intel; digitalPersona; EQUINOX; hp; Ford; Mitsubishi; GE; iCORE; Delphi Toyota; VOLT; MSDN MagazineUNR Comp Vis Lab; Desert Res Inst; Berkeley Lab; NASA; intel; digitalPersona; EQUINOX; hp; Ford; Mitsubishi; GE; iCORE; Delphi Toyota; VOLT; MSDN Magazine	Las Vegas, NVLas Vegas, NV	0	0	0	0	0	0			0302-9743		978-3-642-10330-8	WOS:000278937300040

The objective of this research was to determine the response of several cotton cultivars to mepiquat pentaborate (MPB) application in environments accumulating different levels of heat units. Four MPB application regimes were imposed on three cultivars in Virginia and South Carolina in 2005 and 2006. Total MPB season rates of 0.0, 54.9, 85.3, or 121.9 g ai ha(-1) applied at the five-leaf stage, pin-head square, match-head square, and early bloom were used. The cultivars were: Deltapine (DP) 444 BG/RR, an "early-maturing" cultivar; Fibermax (FM) 960 BR, a "medium-maturing" cultivar; and DP 555 BG/RR, a "late-maturing" cultivar. In South Carolina in 2006, FM 960 BR July plant height was reduced by 25% with MPB application compared to only 12 and 13% for DP 444 BG/RR and DP 555 BG/RR, respectively, although actual plant height reductions were not different among cultivars. Mepiquat pentaborate applications decreased plant height at harvest by 8 to 34%, height-to-node ratio by 10 to 32%, enhanced maturity as measured by nodes above white flower for all cultivars, and decreased lint yield by 3.7 to 8.5% compared to untreated cotton. Higher seasonal totals and earlier initiation of MPB application resulted in the greatest decrease in lint yield.									7	0	0	3	3	7			0002-1962			WOS:000263312100004		
J	Baldwin, Christian M.; Liu, Haibo; McCarty, Lambert B.; Luo, Hong; Toler, Joe E.								Nitrogen and Plant Growth Regulator Influence on 'Champion' Bermudagrass Putting Green under Reduced Sunlight								AGRONOMY JOURNAL				101	1			75	81		10.2134/agronj2008.0004x			JAN-FEB 2009	2009	Managing warm-season turfgrasses with reduced sunlight is challenging due to C(4) plant morphological limitations, such as reduced lateral stem growth. Adjusting cultural management practices, such as N and trinexapac-ethyl (TE) [4-(cyclopropyl-a-hydroxy-methylene)-3,5-dioxocyclohexanecarboxylic acid ethyl ester], application may benefit turfgrass performance when sunlight is reduced. Therefore, a 2-yr field study from 15 June to 15 September in 2006 and 2007 at Clemson University investigated the best management practices for sustaining a high quality 'Champion' bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pets. x C. transvaalensis Burtt-Davy] putting green maintained at a 3.2-min mowing height under reduced sunlight. Treatments included full-sunlight, 55% full-day shade, TE (0.02 kg a.i. ha(-1) 2 wk(-1)), Fe (2.7 kg ha(-1) 2 wk(-1)), and N as liquid urea at 147, 293, and 440 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). Data collection included visual turfgrass quality (TQ), total clipping yield, clipping chlorophyll concentration, root total nonstructural carbohydrates (TNC), thatch accumulation, and thatch depth. Overall, Fe applications minimally impacted parameters measured. Increasing N rates linearly increased TQ when grown under full sunlight. Applying N at similar to 40% lower (147 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) than the typical recommended rates for ultradwarf bermudagrass putting greens improved Champion TQ under reduced light compared to higher N rates. Applying TE resulted in a linear TQ increase for full sunlight and shade-grown Champion bermudagrass. Under reduced sunlight, a 15% chlorophyll concentration increase was noted for TE-treated plots compared to nonTE-treated plots. Shade reduced thatch accumulation 40% compared to sun-grown Champion, which suggests less aggressive cultivation practices are required for thatch control under reduced light. Champion bermudagrass did not provide an acceptable putting green quality when grown under 55% full-day shade, however, adjusting management practices enhanced Champion bermudagrass quality under reduced light.									12	0	0	12	0	12			0002-1962			WOS:000263312100011

We show how several elegant implementations of rank-sensitive priority queues can be obtained by applying novel modifications to treaps and amortized balanced binary search trees, and we show that in the comparison model, the bounds above are essentially the best possible. Finally, we conclude with a case study on the use of rank-sensitive priority queues for shortest path computation.					11th International Workshop on Algorithms and Data Structures (WADS 2009)11th International Workshop on Algorithms and Data Structures (WADS 2009)	AUG 21-23, 2009AUG 21-23, 2009		Banff, CANADABanff, CANADA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0302-9743		978-3-642-03366-7	WOS:000269932200016

Increased extracellular pressure enhances cancer cell integrin-binding affinity through phosphorylation of beta(1)-integrin at threonine 788/789. Am J Physiol Cell Physiol 296: C193-C204, 2009. First published November 12, 2008; doi:10.1152/ajpcell.00355.2008.-Increased extracellular pressure stimulates beta(1)-integrin-dependent cancer cell adhesion. We asked whether pressure-induced adhesion is mediated by changes in beta(1)-integrin binding affinity or avidity and whether these changes are phosphorylation dependent. We evaluated integrin affinity and clustering in human SW620 colon cancer cells by measuring differences in binding between soluble Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-Fc ligands and RGD-Fc-F(ab')(2) multimeric complexes under ambient and 15-mmHg increased pressures. Phosphorylation of beta(1)-integrin S785 and T788/9 residues in SW620 and primary malignant colonocytes was assessed in parallel. We further used GD25-beta(1)-integrin-null murine fibroblasts stably transfected with either wild-type beta(1A)-integrin, S785A, TT788/9AA, or T788D mutants to investigate the role of beta(1)-integrin site-specific phosphorylation. SW620 binding of RGD-Fc-F(ab')(2) multimeric complexes, but not soluble RGD-Fc ligands, was sensitive to integrin clustering. RGD-Fc ligand binding was significantly increased under elevated pressure, suggesting that pressure modulates beta(1)-integrin affinity. Pressure stimulated both beta(1)-integrin S785 and T788/9 phosphorylation. GD25-beta(1A)-integrin wild-type and S785A cells displayed an increase in adhesion to fibronectin under elevated pressure, an effect absent in beta(1)-integrin-null and TT788/9AA cells. T788D substitution significantly elevated basal cell adhesion but displayed no further increase under pressure. These results suggest pressure-induced cell adhesion is mediated by beta(1)-integrin T788/9 phosphorylation-dependent changes in integrin binding affinity.									16	0	0	12	0	16			0363-6143			WOS:000262910100020	19005162	
J	Stanelle, Rayman D.; Marcus, R. Kenneth								Nylon-6 capillary-channeled polymer (C-CP) fibers as a hydrophobic interaction chromatography stationary phase for the separation of proteins								ANALYTICAL AND BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				393	1			273	281		10.1007/s00216-008-2457-2			JAN 2009	2009	Nylon-6 capillary-channeled polymer (C-CP) fibers are used as the stationary phase for the hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) separation of a synthetic protein mixture composed of ribonuclease A, lysozyme, and holotransferrin. Nylon is a useful polymer phase for HIC as it has an alkyl backbone, while the amide functionality is hydrophilic (in fact ionic) in nature. The combination of a nonporous polymer surface of the fiber phases and high column permeability yields very efficient mass transfer characteristics, as exhibited by narrowing of peak widths with increases in mobile phase linear velocity. Retention factors and resolution were evaluated at flow rates ranging from 0.5 to 9 mL/min (linear velocities of ca. 2 to 15 mm/s) and at gradient slopes between 3.3 and 20 %B/min. Optimum resolution was achieved by employing fast flow rates (9 mL/min) and slow gradients (3 %B/min), also resulting in the highest peak capacities.									18	0	0	13	0	18			1618-2642			WOS:000261831000031	18958449

J	Larsen, M. F.; Fesen, C. G.				Larsen, Miguel/A-1079-2013				Accuracy issues of the existing thermospheric wind models: can we rely on them in seeking solutions to wind-driven problems?								ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE				27	6			2277	2284					2009	2009	We address the question of the ability of empirical and general circulation model neutral wind profiles in the lower thermosphere to reproduce the observed characteristics of the winds in that part of the atmosphere. The winds in that altitude range are critical for electrodynamic processes, but evaluations of the model winds are generally difficult because of the sparse observational data, which makes an evaluation of the wind predictions over large areas difficult or impossible. In this paper, we use a recently identified characteristic of the winds in the lower thermosphere, namely the enhanced winds and strong shears between 95 and 115 km altitude, as a test of the models, at least in a statistical sense. Our results show that the Horizontal Wind Model (HWM) significantly underestimates the maximum winds and shears in the lower thermosphere, although it has reasonable agreement with the average winds. The NCAR general circulation model used in this study also underestimates the maximum winds and shears significantly when run with standard resolution, as well as producing an unrealistic increase of the wind speed with height. The agreement between the model and the observations improves significantly however, in a statistical sense, when the altitude resolution is increased. The improved height resolution in the model appears to produce a greater improvement in the model predictions than any of the other factors that we examined, such as improving the geomagnetic forcing or the forcing at the lower boundary.									13	0	0	0	0	13			0992-7689			WOS:000267543600003

The vertical structure and seasonal variability of diurnal and semidiurnal tides from 80-100 km are presented.The analyses show a strong diurnal tide over Jicamarca for both zonal and meridional components with the meridional amplitudes being larger than the zonal ones. Maximal diurnal amplitudes, 45 m/s for zonal and 55 m/s for meridional, are observed around equinox. The zonal diurnal amplitudes reach maxima at 90-96 km, while the meridional diurnal amplitudes grow with altitude for most months. Semidiurnal amplitudes vary not as strong as diurnal amplitudes.The vertical structures of the tidal components are compared with Global ScaleWave Model (GSWM02) prediction and the tidal wind analysis results from TIDI measurements onboard of the TIMED satellite. The data from JASMET and TIDI show similar amplitudes for both diurnal and semidiurnal tides. GSWM02 overestimates diurnal amplitudes, but underestimates semidiurnal amplitudes for both zonal and meridional components.									5	1	0	1	0	6			0992-7689			WOS:000267543600030

Large RCS are found in thick layers around 70 km that also show wide radar spectra, which is interpreted as turbulent broadening. For typical atmospheric and ionospheric conditions, volume scattering RCS for stationary, homogeneous, isotropic turbulence at 3 are also in the range 10(-18) to 10(-16) m(-1), in reasonable agreement with measurements. Moreover, theory predicts maximum cross sections around 70 km, also in agreement with observations. Theoretical values are still a matter of order-of-magnitude estimation, since the Bragg scale of 3 m is near or inside the viscous subrange, where the form of the turbulence spectrum is not well known. In addition, steep electron density gradients can increase cross-sections significantly. For thin layers with large RCS and narrow spectra, isotropic turbulence theory fails and scattering or reflection from anisotropic irregularities may gain relevance.									7	1	0	0	0	7			0992-7689			WOS:000268622700007

Larsen et al. (2004) proposed that a convective roll instability, similar to that found in the planetary boundary layer, is the likely mechanism responsible for the events. This type of instability requires an inflection point in the background winds near the center of the vortex roll with a low static stability region capped by an inversion. The earlier paper argued that the conditions required to support the instability are common in the altitude range where the features are found. In this paper, we use data from the University of Illinois sodium lidar that was located at the Starfire Optical Range near Albuquerque, New Mexico, and from the Maui/MALT Lidar Facility in Hawaii and present several cases that are used to examine the behavior of the inflection point in detail as a function of time during the evolution of the overturning event. In addition, we examine the background static stability conditions using the temperature data from the lidar.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0992-7689			WOS:000268622700029

The species is morphologically similar to Simulium carpathicum (Knoz), but differs in each of these life stages and chromosomally by four fixed inversions and by having a partial chromocentre and a unique Y-chromosome rearrangement. Adults and larvae had been misidentified by previous workers as Simulium carpathicum and Simulium dolomitense (Rivosecchi), respectively.

We find that for the same initial Lorentz factor, the reverse shock becomes progressively weaker with increasing magnetization sigma (the Poynting-to-kinetic energy flux ratio), and the shock becomes a rarefaction wave when s exceeds a critical value, sigma(c), defined by the balance between the magnetic pressure in the flow and the thermal pressure in the forward shock. In the rarefaction wave regime, we find that the rarefied region is accelerated to a Lorentz factor that is significantly larger than the initial value. This acceleration mechanism is due to the strong magnetic pressure in the flow. We discuss the implications of these results for models of gamma-ray bursts and active galactic nuclei.									22	1	0	0	0	22						WOS:000262748100012

Acting White or Acting Black: Mixed-Race Adolescents' Identity and Behavior								B E JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS & POLICY				9	1					9				2009	2009	Although rates of interracial marriage are on the rise, we still know relatively little about the experiences of mixed-race adolescents. In this paper, we examine the identity and behavior of mixed-race (black and white) youth. We find that mixed-race youth adopt both types of behaviors, those that can be empirically characterized as 'black' and those that can be characterized as 'white.' When we combine both types of behavior, average mixed-race behavior is a combination that is neither white nor black, and the variance in mixed-race behavior is generally greater than the variance in behavior of monoracial adolescents, especially as compared to the black racial group. Adolescence is the time during which there is most pressure to establish an identity, and our results indicate that mixed-race youth are finding their own distinct identities, not necessarily 'joining' either monoracial group, but in another sense joining both of them.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1935-1682			WOS:000264803900001		
J	Cuberes, David								A Model of Sequential City Growth								B E JOURNAL OF MACROECONOMICS				9	1					18				2009	2009	Strong evidence indicates that in most countries cities tend to develop sequentially, with the initially largest cities growing first. This paper presents a model of city growth that rationalizes this pattern. Increasing returns to scale constitute the force that favors agglomeration of resources in a city, and convex costs associated with the stock of installed capital represent the congestion force that limits city size. The key to generating sequential city growth is the assumption of irreversible investment in physical capital. As expected, the presence of a positive external effect of aggregate city capital on individual firms makes the competitive equilibrium inefficient.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1935-1690			WOS:000266528600003

The key factors causing amphibian decline in Sri Lanka are of anthropogenic origins; habitat destruction and fragmentation, alien invasive species, wildlife diseases/pathogens, climate change and environmental pollution. Only 750 km2 of Sri Lanka are covered with tropical rainforests and this area is broken into 100 km2 fragments or less It is difficult for amphibians to tolerate disturbances and to maintain a sustainable population size under these conditions. Alien and domestic species impose threats by direct predation, competition, disease contraction and habitat alteration Parasites and pathogens, especially the chirtrid fungus, hamper the growth, reproductive success, and physical fitness of amphibians and can result in mortality Climate change has reduced the distribution of amphibians by modifying vegetation and habitat structure rendering them unsuitable for some amphibians Pollution, especially agro-chemicals, threaten amphibians causing anatomical malformations, physiological disorders and even mass mortalities. Furthermore, acid depositions causing diebacks in montane forests also destroy amphibian niches This paper recommends a number of conservation Initiatives including in-site, and ex-situ conservation, the establishment of buffer zones to protect core forests, promotion of research on biodiversity conservation, Improvement of conservation policies and legal frameworks as well as community based activities including raising public awareness, environmental education and the introduction of eco-friendly agricultural practices.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1488-8386			BCI:BCI200900367749

The adsorption behavior of a protein is governed by the complex set of interactions between the atoms making up the protein, surface, and surrounding solution. Molecular simulation provides a means of theoretically viewing, studying, and understanding these types of interactions at the atomic level. However, as with any application, molecular simulation methods must be properly developed and applied if protein-surface interactions are to be accurately portrayed. This chapter provides an overview of the basics of molecular simulation with a focus on the simulation of protein-surface interactions using molecular dynamics. Important issues such as force field transferability, solvation effects, and statistical sampling are addressed, as well as directions for further development. Molecular simulation methods have the potential to greatly enhance our ability to understand protein-surface interactions, leading to improvements in biomaterials design to control cellular response and to improve the sensitivity of biosensors and other bioanalytical systems.									2	0	0	0	0	2					978-0-387-98160-4	WOS:000269612400004

Prediction of DNA-binding residues from protein sequence information using random forests								BMC GENOMICS				10						S1	10.1186/1471-2164-10-S1-S1			2009	2009	Background: Protein-DNA interactions are involved in many biological processes essential for cellular function. To understand the molecular mechanism of protein-DNA recognition, it is necessary to identify the DNA-binding residues in DNA-binding proteins. However, structural data are available for only a few hundreds of protein-DNA complexes. With the rapid accumulation of sequence data, it becomes an important but challenging task to accurately predict DNA-binding residues directly from amino acid sequence data.Results: A new machine learning approach has been developed in this study for predicting DNA-binding residues from amino acid sequence data. The approach used both the labelled data instances collected from the available structures of protein-DNA complexes and the abundant unlabeled data found in protein sequence databases. The evolutionary information contained in the unlabeled sequence data was represented as position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) and several new descriptors. The sequence-derived features were then used to train random forests (RFs), which could handle a large number of input variables and avoid model overfitting. The use of evolutionary information was found to significantly improve classifier performance. The RF classifier was further evaluated using a separate test dataset, and the predicted DNA-binding residues were examined in the context of three-dimensional structures.Conclusion: The results suggest that the RF-based approach gives rise to more accurate prediction of DNA-binding residues than previous studies. A new web server called BindN-RF http://bioinfo.ggc.org/bindn-rf/ has thus been developed to make the RF classifier accessible to the biological research community.									43	2	0	36	0	46			1471-2164			WOS:000268634900002	19594868

ACM					Extending the Reggio Emilia Educational Approach to Creativity Support Environments								C & C 09: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2009 ACM SIGCHI CONFERENCE ON CREATIVITY AND COGNITION								375	376					2009	2009	Intelligent Systems can effectively bridge the wondrous world of childhood and the adult world of rules, goals and expectations. This paper explores the possibility of an embodied child-computer interaction that cultivates creativity a core value of the successful adult in an increasingly digital society. We draw specifically on the Reggio Emilia method of education, not by adding to it PCs (as has been done, with mixed results), but instead, by respecting its focus on haptics on the handling of physical things as a way of learning embedding computation in the very fabric of the physical environment. We call this embodied system a Creativity Support Environment to emphasize the role of the physical environment as, itself, a "teacher" of creativity.

B	Huffman, John W.						Reggio, PH		Cannabimimetic Indoles, Pyrroles, and Indenes: Structure-Activity Relationships and Receptor Interactions								Cannabinoid Receptors		RECEPTORS						49	94		10.1007/978-1-59745-503-9_3			2009	2009	A number of years ago it was found that 1-aminoalkyl-3-aroylindoles have affinity for the canabinoid receptor that is expressed in the central nervous system (CB1 receptor). More than 100 of these aminoalkylindoles were prepared and structure-activity relationships (SARs) were developed for these compounds. Subsequently it was found that the aminoalkyl substituent could be replaced by a straight chain alkyl group of four to six carbon atoms without loss of affinity for the CB1 receptor. One of these indoles, 1-propyl-3-(1-naphthoyl)indole was found to have relatively high affinity for the cannabinoid receptor that is expressed in the periphery (CB2 receptor), but with little affinity for the CBI receptor. In order to explore the SAR for these cannabimimetic 3-(1-naphthoyl)alkylindoles a number of compounds have been synthesized, some of which have very high affinity for the CB1 receptor and others which are highly selective for the CB2 receptor.On the basis of a suggested pharmacophore for the cannabimimetic indoles, a series of 1-alkyl-3-(1-naphthoyl)pyrroles was prepared, one of which had modest affinity for the CB1 receptor and was active in vivo. Subsequent work led to the development of a series of 1-alkyl-2-aryl-4-(1-naphthoyl)pyrroles, some of which have high affinity for the CB1 and/or CB2 receptor. Two groups have reported the synthesis of cannabimimetic indenes, which serve as rigid models for the CB1 receptor. Through a combination of molecular modeling and studies of mutant receptors a body of evidence has been acquired, which indicates that cannabimimetic indoles, and by extension pyrroles and indenes, interact with the CB1 and CB2 receptors primarily by aromatic stacking.									47	0	0	21	0	47					978-1-58829-712-9(H)	BCI:BCI200900277759

A detailed examination of soil organic and inorganic carbon distribution at depth in Mollisols of the U.S. Northern Great Plains and the Russian Chernozem shows that cultivation of these soils decreased soil organic stock and increased soil inorganic carbon stock. The global significance of these results is that one of the most fertile and productive agricultural soils in the world that was initially native grasslands incorporated massive amounts of organic matter into the soil during cultivation. This dramatic event (going from equilibrium native grassland state to being plowed) caused a loss of organic carbon, and our analysis indicates that there may have been a corresponding gain of soil inorganic carbon in fertile calcium rich soils in the temperate grassland ecosystem. Mollisols may be a significant sink of inorganic carbon through pedogenic carbonate formation, which may partially offset carbon loss from soil organic matter decomposition.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0065-8448		978-0-87590-448-1	WOS:000276577500010

The design of these clusters allows individual virtual machines to be independent of the underlying physical hardware, potentially allowing virtual clusters to span multiple grid sites. A major challenge in using Virtual Organization Clusters as a grid computing abstraction arises from the need to schedule and provision physical resources to run the virtual machines.This paper describes a virtual cluster scheduler implementation based on the Condor High Throughput Computing system. By means of real-time monitoring of the Condor job queue, virtual machines that belong to individual Virtual Organizations are provisioned and booted. Jobs belonging to each Virtual Organization are then run on the organization-specific virtual machines, which form a cluster dedicated to the specific organization. Once the queued jobs have executed, the virtual machines are terminated, thereby allowing the physical resources to be re-claimed. Tests of this system were conducted using synthetic work-loads, demonstrating that dynamic provisioning of virtual machines preserves system throughput for all but the shortest-running of grid jobs, without undue increase in scheduling latency.					9th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster Computing and the Grid9th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster Computing and the Grid	MAY 18-21, 2009MAY 18-21, 2009	IEEE; IEEE Comp Soc; Tech Comm Scalable CompIEEE; IEEE Comp Soc; Tech Comm Scalable Comp	Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINAShanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA	13	0	0	0	0	13					978-1-4244-3935-5	WOS:000270899400049

Electrochemical studies confirmed the formation of the [6,6] regioisomers for the Y3N@C-80-based dyads and the [5,6] re-gioisomers in the case of Sc3N@C-80-based dyads. Similar to other TNT endohedral metallofullerene systems previously synthesized, irreversible reductive behavior was observed for the [6,6]-Y3N@C-80-bascd dyads, whereas the [5,6]-Sc3N@C-80-based dyads exhibited reversible reductive electrochemistry. Density functional calculations were also carried out on these dyads confirming the importance of these structures as electron transfer model systems. Furthermore, pholophysical investigations on a ferrocenyl-Sc3N@ C-80-fulleropyrrolidine dyad demonstrated the existence of a photoinduced electron-transfer process that yields a radical ion pair with a lifetime three times longer than that obtained for the analogous C-60 dyad.									73	0	0	11	0	73			0947-6539			WOS:000262886800008	19053104

The products were further derivatized by using the "grafting from" strategy of in situ ring-opening polymerization (ROP) and atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). Using one-step nitrene chemistry with high-energy reagents, such as azidoethanol and azidoethyl 2-bromo-2-methyl propanoate, in N-methyl -2-pyrrolidone at 160 degrees C for 16 h, hydroxyl and bromide functionalities were introduced onto the surfaces of CNOs. These hydroxyl CNOs (CNO-OH) and bromic CNOs (CNO-Br) were extensively characterized by various techniques such as thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photo electron spectroscopy (XPS). TGA measurements indicated that the surface hydroxyl and bromide group density reached 1.49 and 0.49 mmolg(-1), respectively. The as-functionalized CNOs showed much better solubility in solvents than pristine CNOs. The CNO-OH were also observed to fluoresce at lambda = 453 nm in water. The CNO-OH and CNO-Br can be conveniently utilized as macroinitiators to conduct surface-initiated in-situ polymerizations. Poly(E-caprolactone) (PCL, 45wt%) and polystyrene (PS, 60wt%) were then grafted from surfaces of CNOs through the ROP of E-caprolactone with the macroinitiator CNO-OH and the ATRP of styrene with the macroinitiator CNO-Br, respectively. The structures and morphology of the resulting products were characterized by H-1 NMR, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), TEM, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The polymer functionalized CNOs have good solubility/dispersibility in common organic solvents. The facile and scalable functionalization approaches can pave the way for the comprehensive investigation of chemistry of CNOs and fabrication of novel CNO-based nanomaterials and nanodevices.									39	1	0	2	0	39			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000263093800014	19115308

CNOs were functionalized by 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition and the resulting products were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, Raman and energy dispersive spectroscopics. The electronic properties of the Fc-CNO derivative were investigated by electrochemical and photophysical techniques, complemented by quantum chemical calculations. On average, the CNOs have a spherical appearance with six shells. Functionalization saturates one carbon atom in 36 carbon atoms on the outer cage of the CNO. Through-space interactions between the Fc moiety and the CNO core were detected electrochemically. Fluorescence was observed at low and high energies with an intrinsic decay that is faster at lower energies. Based on theory and experiment, we conclude that, after absorption of a photon at low energy, there is emission from CNOs characterized by larger external shells and a lower degree of functionalization. At high energy, emission comes from CNOs with smaller external shells and a higher degree of functionalization.									25	0	0	3	0	25			0947-6539			WOS:000265874700024	19263442

The electronic structure of the singly oxidized and reduced MNEFs has been thoroughly analyzed and the first anodic and cathodic potentials, as well as the electrochemical gaps, have been predicted for a large number of M3N@C-2n Systems (M=Sc, Y, La, and Gd; 2n = 80, 84, 88, 92, and 96). In particular, calculations that include thermal and entropic effects correctly predict the different anodic behavior of the two isomers (I-h and D-5h) of Sc3N@C-80, which is the basis for their electrochemical separation. Important differences were found in the electronic structure of reduced M3N@C-80 when M = Sc or when M is a more electropositive metal, such as Y or Gd. Moreover, the changes in the electrochemical gaps within the Gd3N@C-2n series (2n=80, 84, and 88) have been rationalized and the use of Y-based computational models to study the Gd-based systems has been justified. The redox properties of the largest MNEFs characterized so far, La3N@C-2n (2n=92 and 96), were also correctly predicted. Finally, the quality of these predictions and their usefulness in distinguishing the carbon cages for MNEFs with unknown structures is discussed.									56	1	0	7	0	56			0947-6539	1521-3765		WOS:000271605900038	19760713

IEEE					Character recognition with two spiking neural network models on multicore architectures								CIMSVP 2009: IEEE SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE FOR MULTIMEDIA SIGNAL AND VISION PROCESSING								29	34					2009	2009	This paper presents the use of the Izhikevich and Hodgkin Huxley neuron models for image recognition. The former is more biologically accurate than the commonly used integrate and fire neuron model but has similar low computational requirements. Brain scale cortex models tend to use the more biological neuron models. The results of this work show that the Izhikevich model can be used for image recognition and would be a good candidate for a large scale visual cortex model. Neural networks based on these models are developed and applied to character recognition. They were able to identify 48 24x24 images and their noisy versions. The networks were accelerated using modern multicore processors and showed significant speedups. Such processors are likely to be used for developing high performance, large scale implementations of these image recognition networks.

The purpose of this article is to better understand tourists' preferences for management options and policies related to public beach access. A stated preference choice method is used to identify the extent of coastal tourists' concern about current beach management programs and support for prospective management actions related to public beach access. Results provide management agencies with a comprehensive understanding of tourists' preferences for management attributes, as well as willingness to make tradeoffs among the attributes. The article concludes with a discussion of beach management implications and future research that will benefit beach management.									13	0	0	1	0	13			0892-0753			WOS:000263088800001		
J	Powell, Robert B.; Cuschnir, Ariel; Peiris, Prakash								Overcoming Governance and Institutional Barriers to Integrated Coastal Zone, Marine Protected Area, and Tourism Management in Sri Lanka								COASTAL MANAGEMENT				37	6			633	655		10.1080/08920750903194272			2009	2009	One of the major barriers to addressing complex social-ecological issues through integrated coastal management (ICM) is a lack of intergovernmental coordination and cooperation (horizontal and vertical fragmentation). This article describes an effort to overcome the barriers to ICM in Sri Lanka by fostering intergovernmental collaboration and initiating adaptive governance to restore one town, Hikkaduwa, and its associated marine protected area (MPA) and coastal zone habitats. Administrators from 12 national and local governmental agencies that are responsible for aspects of coastal management in the town of Hikkaduwa participated in a series of formal and informal workshops and a week-long tour of ICM projects in the Philippines. Outcomes demonstrate that these informal and formal meetings, workshops, and travel experiences fostered trust, social capital, and attitudinal organizational commitment (AOC). The experiences motivated members to overcome vertical and horizontal governance fragmentation through the formation of an independent intergovernmental committee for the restoration of Hikkaduwa into a sustainable and resilient community. ICM activities undertaken by the newly formed organization suggest that internal leadership capacity, effective local-national partnerships, explicitly linked ecological-economic projects, and long-term commitment are necessary conditions for success. Overall, attainment of sustainability and resilience through successful ICM should be thought of as a journey and not a destination.									7	0	0	3	0	7			0892-0753			WOS:000272768700008

The largest integer which is not an element of S is called the Frobenius number of S. Recently, J. M. Marin, J. L. Ramirez Alfonsin, and M. P. Revuelta determined the Frobenius number of a Fibonacci semigroup, that is, a numerical semigroup generated by a certain set of Fibonacci numbers. In this paper, we consider numerical semigroups generated by certain generalized Fibonacci numbers. Using a technique of S. M. Johnson, we find the Frobenius numbers of such semigroups obtaining the result of Marin et al. as a special case. In addition, we determine the duals of such semigroups and relate them to the associated Lipman semigroups.

Femtosecond Laser Direct Writing (FLDW) in transparent materials is a powerful tool for the fabrication of such integrated devices. We demonstrate the use of FLDW to fabricate coupled micro-fluidic channels and optical waveguides towards an integrated sensing device for molecular detection. Waveguides were directly written into the host material and channels were formed by modifying the molecular structure through FLDW followed by wet chemical etching. Multiple host materials including chalcogenide glasses for IR detection are discussed.

The method involves a simple artificial viscosity stabilization of the linear system for the approximation of the new time level connected to anti-diffusion of its effects at the old time level, lowering the cell Reynolds number of the Oseen problem to O(1). The method requires only the solution of one linear system (arising from an Oseen problem) per time step. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated in several numerical experiments.

Specifically, we analyze the case of the Taipei National Enterprise Center (TNEC) excavation using two soil models, the Modified Cam-clay model (MCC) and the three-Surface Kinematic Hardening model (3-SKH). Our finite element analysis includes a consideration of the over-consolidated stress state and the high initial shear modulus of the clay. Results show that the observed wall deflection and surface settlement can be satisfactorily predicted simultaneously using the 3-SKH model. This is an improvement on the MCC model, for which only wall deflection, not ground settlement, can be accurately predicted. This study re-confirms the importance of considering small-strain non-linear behavior for the over-consolidated stress state in finite element analyses of braced excavation responses.

Annual Conference				2009				6001	5		10.1109/IEMBS.2009.5332513			2009	2009	Tissue engineering has the potential to improve the current methods for replacing organs and tissues and for investigating cellular process within the scope of a tissue test system. Bioprinting technology can aid in the difficult task of arranging live mammalian cells and biomaterials in viable structures for tissue engineering purposes. This paper describes a system, based on HP26 series print cartridge technology, capable of precisely depositing multiple cell types in precise patterns. The paper discusses the research, design, and implementation of the printing system, which permits control of droplet firing parameters, including firing energy, speed, and spacing. The results demonstrate the system's fine patterning ability of viable cells, including two-dimensional patterned co-cultures of two cell types. The system has been specifically designed with the flexibility to be extended to print more than two cell types and/or materials simultaneously and to layer printed patterns to form three-dimensional constructs. With these features, the printing system will serve as the foundation for a biofabrication system capable of three-dimensional cell co-cultures, i.e. tissue test systems.									0	1	0	0	0	1			1557-170X			MEDLINE:19963663	19963663

J	Thodesen, Carl; Shatanawi, Khaldoun; Amirkhanian, Serji								Effect of crumb rubber characteristics on crumb rubber modified (CRM) binder viscosity								CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS				23	1			295	303		10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2007.12.007			JAN 2009	2009	Asphalt binder viscosity is of great importance during the production process of hot mix asphalt mixture as typically asphalt plants will store binders between 149 degrees C and 177 degrees C. SHRP guidelines state that asphalt binder viscosity must not exceed 3 Pa s. Therefore, given the documented increases in asphalt viscosity when modified with crumb rubber modifier (CRM) it is necessary to produce asphalt binder that fulfills the SHRP criteria while not exceeding plant mixing and storing requirements. This paper reports the results of an investigation of the importance of CRM properties on viscosity of CRM binder. Two binder sources were modified at four concentration levels using four different crumb rubber sources; the viscosities of the produced binders were evaluated by AASHTO T 316. Crumb rubber properties were evaluated by elemental analysis using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and by determination of glass transition temperature (T(g)) using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). In general, results indicate that processing procedure and tire type plays an important role in the determination of CRM binder viscosity. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, the influence of the surface area of CRM blends on the high temperature properties, i.e., the complex modulus (G*), the phase angle and high temperature grade of the CRM binders was investigated. To this end, the surface areas of CRM particles were measured using the BET (Brunauer, Emmett and Teller) tester, while weighted average particle size of CRM blends was calculated based on their graduations and then used as a size index. High temperature properties of CRM binders were measured using Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR) test. A total of 108 CRM binders were produced using different combinations of these variables. Results observed from this study indicated: (1) the surface area of the ambient CRM was twice as large as that of the cryogenic one, leading to a much higher G* and phase angle of the CRM binders; (2) the phase angle and G* were affected by both the surface area and average size; however, the average size is the predominating factor; and (3) ambient CRM binders were produced about 3 degrees C in high temperature grade higher than cryogenic CRM binders.

J	Akisetty, Chandra K.; Lee, Soon-Jae; Amirkhanian, Serji N.								High temperature properties of rubberized binders containing warm asphalt additives								CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS				23	1			565	573		10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2007.10.010			JAN 2009	2009	Several studies have been conducted evaluating the properties of warm mix asphalt (WMA), and it is observed that warm asphalt additives work in different ways to either reduce the viscosity of the binder or to allow better workability of the mix at lower temperatures. In terms of rubberized asphalt mixtures, they are compacted at a higher temperature than conventional mixtures, based on the field experience. If the technologies of warm mix asphalt are incorporated, it is expected to reduce the mixing and compaction temperatures of rubberized asphalt mixtures to those of conventional mixtures. This paper presents the high temperature properties of rubberized binders containing warm asphalt additives. Rubberized binders were produced at 10% by binder weight using five binder sources, and the binders with the additives were produced using two (i.e. Aspha-min (R) and Sasobit (R)) of the available processes and artificially short-term aged through the rolling thin film oven (RTFO) method. Tests were conducted on the binders using the rotational viscometer and the Dynamic Shear Rheometer. The results indicated that the viscosity properties of rubberized binders can be changed significantly through the use of warm asphalt additives. Also, the addition of the additives was found to improve rutting resistance of the rubberized binders. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Chandra ACIS-S imagery shows that the Herbig Ae star has L-x/L-bol and a pulse height spectrum similar to beta Pic Moving Group early F stars, suggesting a similar magnetic field configuration and X-ray production in winds. The disk lacks the conspicuous Fe It emission and continuum seen in FUV spectra of actively secreting Herbig Ae stars, and FUSE, HST ACS FUV, and FEROS data suggest a 3 sigma upper limit on accretion rate of 4.0x 10(-10) M circle dot yr(-1). Weak, variable Ha and Br gamma emission suggest low levels of intermittent accretion or contamination by stellar activity. We confirm that HD 100453B is a common proper motion companion to HD 100453A, with a spectral type of M4.0V - M4.5V, and derive an age of 14 +/- 4 Myr It is likely the companion has truncated the circumprimary disk radius at less than similar to 50 AU, and we estimate the dust mass to be similar to 0.1 M-J. A sensitive upper limit to the CO J = 3-2 intensity indicates that the gas in the outer disk is likely optically thin. Assuming a [CO]/[H-2] abundance of 1 x 10(-4) and a depletion factor of 103, we find that the mass of cold molecular gas is less than similar to 0.33 M-J and that the gas-to-dust ratio is no more than similar to 4:1 in the outer disk.					15th Cambridge Workshop on Cool Stars, Stellar Systems and the Sun15th Cambridge Workshop on Cool Stars, Stellar Systems and the Sun	JUL 21-25, 2008JUL 21-25, 2008	Royal Astron Soc; Scottish Univ Phys Alliance; European Space Agcy; NASA Astrobiol InstRoyal Astron Soc; Scottish Univ Phys Alliance; European Space Agcy; NASA Astrobiol Inst	St Andrews, SCOTLANDSt Andrews, SCOTLAND	0	0	0	0	0	0			0094-243X		978-0-7354-0627-8	WOS:000264752500064

Students gain a familiarity with design tools as they use them in early engineering classes, and will traditionally implement similar methods to seek future design solutions. Problems arise because design tools are often used inappropriately, which may or may not lead to productive outcomes. Understanding how design tools are incorporated into engineering curriculum will reveal how that particular method was selected, the background information given to the student to facilitate tool use, and the benefit gained from using the specific tool in the given case. This information is valuable to the evaluation of the engineering curriculum of which few performance metrics exist. This case study utilizes a design team enrolled in a capstone design course to collect data on the use of design tools throughout their curriculum. Trends are revealed that relate how the tool use is implemented, how the instruction is delivered to the student, and the beneficial application of those to the given design project. These trends directly apply to the intellectual growth of the student as well as the topical coverage and implementation by the engineering department. Using this information, the engineering curriculum can improve its delivery of design instruction.

To this end a wheel which can perform in a lunar environment for an extended period of time and distance is needed. This paper analyzes and evaluates the attempts to develop such a solution and the challenges which have arisen. Furthermore, it builds upon an analytical basis for the proposed solution and examines further applications in vehicular mobility. Specifically, three concepts were conceived, analyzed, prototyped, and tested in a senior design project class supported by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Michelin Tire Corporation, then critically examined for failure modes. The lessons learned from the analysis are currently being applied in the development of third and fourth generation prototypes.

This approach computes lateral forces iteratively from two separate submodels. The first submodel is an appropriate tire model that computes per wheel lateral forces as functions of slip angles, from formulations preferably expressed in a non-dimensional format. The second is a lateral weight transfer submodel that computes per-axle lateral force contributions for a given lateral acceleration. The combination then allows for the estimation of the required steer angles for the prevailing lateral acceleration. Subsequent corrections are then applied to take into account steer effects such as roll steer, lateral force compliance steer and aligning moment compliance steer. The usefulness of the approach is demonstrated by comparing simulation results with test data for a small passenger car.

This regime shift provides a unique opportunity to estimate the elasticity of labor supply at a new margin: the length of the employment contract. A $5000 bonus differential is estimated to increase the probability that a recruit will choose a 6-year enlistment over a 4-year enlistment by 30 percentage points.

Without appropriate linkage between redesign decisions and strategic inputs, identifying processes that need to be modified will be difficult. In this paper, we draw attention to the analysis of business process change requirements in support of process change initiatives. Business process redesign is a multifaceted phenomenon involving processes, organizational structure, management systems, human resource architecture, and many other aspects of organizational life. To be successful, the business process initiative should focus not only on identifying the processes to be redesigned, but also pay attention to various enablers of change. Above all, a framework is just a blueprints management must lead change. We hope our modest contribution will draw attention to the broader framing of requirements for business process change.

The proffered taxonomy is evaluated by three approaches: (i) checking the orthogonality of the individual elements of the taxonomy, (ii) benchmarking the proposed taxonomy with existing classifications of prototypes, and (iii) demonstrating its utility by applying it to classify different prototypes. The results show the proposed taxonomy is capable of distinguishing prototypes with greater precision than what is possible with current classifications. Further, the proposed classification is generally orthogonal, allowing for more consistent delineation between prototypes. However, the findings also reveal that some of the taxa are interdependent; exploring these interdependencies to develop a deeper understanding of how prototyping influences design thinking is the focus of future research.

The procedure for functional decomposition, however, has not been formalized. In a larger effort to understand and develop rules for functional decomposition, this paper develops rules for composition of reverse-engineered functional models. First, the functional basis hierarchy is used in an attempt to compose the functional model of a hair dryer, which does not produce the desired results. Second, a set of rules for composition is presented and applied to the hair dryer functional model. This composed functional model is more similar to the desired decomposition result than the functional model developed by changing hierarchical levels. Ten additional functional models are also composed and the results shown. The findings demonstrate that composition rules can be developed empirically through analysis of functional models.

The proposed packing algorithm packs three-dimensional free-form objects inside an arbitrary enclosure such that the packing efficiency is maximized. The proposed packing algorithm can handle objects with holes or cavities and its performance does not degrade significantly with the increase in complexity of the enclosure or the objects. The packing algorithm takes as input the triangulated geometry of the container and all the objects to be packed and outputs the list of objects that can be placed inside the enclosure. The packing algorithm also outputs the location and orientation of all the objects, the packing sequence, and the packed configuration. An improved layout algorithm that works with arbitrary container geometry is also proposed. Several heuristics to improve the performance of the packing algorithm as well as certain aspects that facilitate fast and efficient handling of CAD data are also discussed. A comprehensive benchmarking of the proposed packing algorithm on synthetic and hypothetical problems reflects its superior performance as compared to other similar approaches.

These limitations are addressed by developing a new parametric-based exemplar approach. This approach calculates a set of maxima and minima based on the specifications of the query mold insert. The design exemplar is essentially useful to prototype the query mechanism. However due to time complexity, the parametric approach was implemented as a dedicated software package.

PDM are used in industrial applications for long-term archival of product information, to enhance collaboration and communication throughout the design process, support distributed design teams through advanced document sharing, track changes in product information, and control design documents ranging from requirements information to CAD. However, undergraduate mechanical engineering students typically graduate with limited or no exposure to PDM systems. This paper investigates the benefits and challenges associated with modem PDM systems. Moreover, the need for PDM systems in undergraduate education are discussed and means for integrating this technology is presented. A survey of engineering institutions in the U.S. is completed to understand the current usage in academic settings.

MDO frameworks have been developed which facilitate the integration of disciplinary analysis code and optimization techniques. Commonly used MDO frameworks include ModelCenter, iSIGHT, modeFRONTIER and FIDO. Recent advances in MDO framework have addressed issues related to data exchange, distributed computing, process integration and trade study. However managing, storing and sharing MDO problem information have not yet been addressed. Thus, the primary objective in this research is to propose a new configuration for MDO frameworks to enhance information management capabilities. This is achieved by (1) identifying requirements for managing decision-related information, (2) evaluating current MDO frameworks against the key information management requirements, and (3) extending current software to include a file information system and structured repository. Finally, a new configuration is developed augmenting a structured repository to enable reuse of information associated with the formulation of MDO problems.

Though they are used extensively, there appears to be no accepted systematic case study method used by design researchers. Considering its nature and objectives, the case study method could be considered as a suitable method for conducting design research. Many times, design researchers have to confront questions about the validity of using case studies and their results. The objective of this paper is to present a brief overview of case Study method, compare it with other qualitative and quantitative research methods, and study the merits and limitations of using the same in design research. Requirements are derived from the general characteristics of design research. Four popular research strategies are evaluated with respect to the requirements. A preliminary benchmark study suggests that case study method is a suitable method for conducting design research.

Effervescent systems are not stable in the presence of trace amount of moisture, and elimination or inactivation of free water is the key to stability apart from manufacturing in controlled humidity environment. Our main objective of the project was to develop FETs of glibenclamide based on highly plastic granules that can be compressed at low pressure to form fast-melting pharmaceutical tablets. In this study, we have screened various acid and carbonate sources for the effervescent system. Citric acid was coated with plastic materials such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), which provide a physical barrier to the reaction. The inherent hygroscopic nature of PEG could decrease the affinity for moisture of effervescent mixtures and can provide a stabilizing effect. Sodium bicarbonate was blended with sugar alcohol like mannitol, which would give a protective coating. PEG 1000 melts at body temperature (37C) and thereby does not delay the reaction between the acid source and base. The present formulation using citric acid-sodium bicarbonate and citric acid-sodium glycine carbonate tablet with PEG and mannitol was found to have better reaction properties and reaction stability than does the standard citric acid-sodium bicarbonate tablet. FETs of glibenclamide might aid in dissolution due to increase in microenvironmental pH around the granules and saliva. Sensory study on disintegration time and mouth feel attributes ranked the present formulation based on grittiness, chalkiness, and overall preference as best.									7	3	0	2	2	11			0363-9045			WOS:000263560700007	18821151

These are particularly important issues for scandium and scandium deuteride films used in neutron tube applications, where the interaction between the microstructure, high residual stresses and hydrogen diffusion can lead to premature failure. This study combines small-volume mechanical property and interfacial fracture tests to define the effects of ageing on properties of 150 nm thick scandium and scandium deuteride films. Film aging was simulated by rapid thermal annealing. During this treatment, the film's structure and composition were altered, resulting in mechanical property and fracture energy changes. The interfacial fracture energy decreased from over 3 J m(-2) to less than 1 J m(-2) after accelerated aging by rapid thermal annealing.

Service selection techniques often return a single value representing the rank of a service. Users of the service, however, may not always have identical needs and may be interested in ratings based on multiple categories.

To address this, our investigation will also include examining the issues of adding Quality of Service (QoS) factors with social service selection.					8th IEEE International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing8th IEEE International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing	DEC 12-14, 2009DEC 12-14, 2009	IEEE; IEEE Comp Soc, Tech Comm Scalable Comp; Natl Nat Sci Fdn China; Univ Elect Sci & Technol China; IEEE Chengdu SectIEEE; IEEE Comp Soc, Tech Comm Scalable Comp; Natl Nat Sci Fdn China; Univ Elect Sci & Technol China; IEEE Chengdu Sect	Chengdu, PEOPLES R CHINAChengdu, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7695-3929-4	WOS:000277026000042

Such a microring is typically made from an optically active polymer, which is fabricated on a metallic wire. Because of the operation frequency, the microring is modeled as an infinite dielectric cylinder with a metallic inner boundary. Vector potential Green functions, from which the whispering gallery mode fields are computed, are presented, and a simplified method of computing fields is introduced. Computed results show that the whispering gallery mode field in the dielectric cylinder is detached from its inner boundary and the phenomena can be achieved by increasing the thickness of the dielectric layer.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0272-6343			WOS:000262183000001

In addition, the optimization of the power acquired from the energy harvester is considered. The harvesting device is a piezoceramic element in a stack configuration, which scavenges mechanical energy emanating from a I D-sinusoidal-base excitation. The device is connected to a harvesting circuit, which employs an inductor and a resistive load. This circuit represents a generalization of the purely resistive circuit, which has received considerable attention ill the literature. The optimization problem is formulated as a nonlinear programming problem, wherein the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions are stated and the various resulting cases are treated. One of these cases is that of a purely resistive circuit. For resistive circuits, researchers usually neglect the effect of mechanical damping in their optimization procedures. However, in this chapter, we specifically explore the role of damping and electromechanical coupling on the optimization of circuit parameters. We show that mechanical damping has a qualitative effect oil the optimal circuit parameters. Further, we observe that beyond all optimal coupling coefficient, the harvested power decreases. This result challenges previously published results suggesting that larger coupling coefficients culminate in more efficient energy harvesters. As for the harvesting circuit, the addition of the inductor provides substantial improvement to the performance of the energy harvesting device. More specifically, at the optimal circuit parameters, optimal power values obtained through a purely resistive circuit at optimal excitation frequencies can be obtained at any excitation frequency. Moreover, simulations reveal that the optimal harvested power is independent of the coupling coefficient (within realistic values of the coupling coefficient); a result that supports our previous findings for a purely resistive circuit.									0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-387-76463-4	WOS:000268240100006

Agency and Governance in Strategic Entrepreneurship								ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY AND PRACTICE				33	1			149	166		10.1111/j.1540-6520.2008.00284.x			JAN 2009	2009	This paper aims to highlight the opportunity to contribute to our understanding of strategic entrepreneurship by exploring the construct through the lens of agency theory. In particular, we claim a fundamental link between a new venture's control of critical resources and the distribution of equity between the principal and agent. According to agency theory, assigning top executives ownership in the firm provides arrangements that are compatible with the incentives of the owners of the firm. This paper suggests that agency theory has special relevance when considered in a strategic entrepreneurship context. This is because the function of managers in entrepreneurial new ventures is fundamentally different from their counterparts in large established, incumbent corporations. While both types of managers have to provide managerial and organizational expertise, managers in entrepreneurial new ventures have an additional function that is essential to the competitive advantage and performance of the new venture-providing knowledge and human capital, which, in many cases, is intrinsically linked to the capital resources of the new venture. Our framework is tested using patent ownership as a proxy for both relationship-specific investments and indispensable human capital of the top manager of the new venture. The empirical results support the main hypotheses posited by the entrepreneurial governance model. In particular, patent ownership of the top manager significantly increases the percentage of equity held, while the number of patents held by the firm significantly decreases the percentage of ownership.									25	0	0	0	0	25			1042-2587	1540-6520		WOS:000262048300007

Klaine, Stephen/C-5352-2011				BIOCHEMICAL AND BEHAVIORAL EFFECTS OF DIAZINON EXPOSURE IN HYBRID STRIPED BASS								ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY				28	1			105	112		10.1897/08-001.1			JAN 2009	2009	The effects of environmental stimuli on biochemical processes may influence behavior. Environmental contaminants that alter behavior can have major impacts on populations as well as community structures by changing species' interactions. One important behavior is the ability to capture prey. We hypothesized that sublethal exposure to diazinon, an organophosphate pesticide, may lead to feeding behavior abnormalities in hybrid striped bass (Morone saxatilis x M. chrysops) through inhibition of brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. This can potentially reduce the organism's survival by affecting its ability to find and capture food. To test this hypothesis, bass were exposed to diazinon for 6 d, followed by a 6-d recovery period in clean water. Brain AChE activity and the ability of bass to capture prey fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) were measured every third day. Exposed fish exhibited a concentration-and duration-dependent decrease in ability to capture prey. While bass in all diazinon treatment groups had significantly inhibited brain AChE activity, only the medium and high treatment groups showed a dose-and time-dependent increase in time to capture prey. Acetylcholinesterase activity also decreased in an exposure duration-and concentration-dependent manner. The AChE levels in exposed fish did not recover to control levels during the 6-d recovery period. These results suggest that sublethal exposure to AChE-inhibiting substances may decrease the ecological fitness of hybrid striped bass by reducing their ability to capture prey.									15	1	0	13	0	16			0730-7268			WOS:000262399700013	18700818

Identification of ectodysplasin-A receptor gene deletion at 2q12.2 and a potential autosomal MR locus								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS				17	1			30	36		10.1038/ejhg.2008.183			JAN 2009	2009	Mental retardation (MR) is not a common feature observed in patients with classical ectodermal dysplasias (EDs). Several genes responsible for EDs and MR have been identified. However, the causation has yet to be identified in a significant number of patients with either ED or MR. Here, we have molecularly characterized a de novo balanced translocation t(1; 6)(p22.1; p22.1) in a female patient who had mild features of ED with hypodontia, microcephaly, and cognitive impairment. Mapping of the translocation breakpoints in the patient revealed no obvious causative gene for either ED or MR. Whole genome array CGH analysis unveiled two novel submicroscopic deletions at 2q12.2 and 6q22.3, unrelated to the translocation in the patient. The 2q12.2 deletion contains a known ED gene, ectodysplasin-A receptor (EDAR), and the loss of one copy of this gene is considered to be responsible for the ectodermal phenotype in the patient. It is plausible that a potential autosomal MR gene deleted at 2q12.2 or 6q22.3 is likely the cause of the neurodevelopmental defects in the patient.									3	0	0	3	0	3			1018-4813			WOS:000261588800005	18854857	
J	Daly, Aidan; Grove, Stephen J.; Dorseh, Michael J.; Fisk, Raymond P.								The impact of improvisation training on service employees in a European airline: a case study								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MARKETING				43	3-4			459	472		10.1108/03090560910935532			2009	2009	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the value of improvisation training, as used in schools of acting, in preparing front-stage service employees perform their roles when interacting with customers as cabin crew in Aer Arann, a regional Irish airline.Design/methodology/approach - To discern the relevance and impact of improvisation training, a case study methodology was employed. The subjects of the investigation were seven recently hired cabin crew personnel for Aer Arann. Data for the case study were collected from the new hires at three different times.Findings - The study shows that participants both enjoyed the improvisation training and found it to be very valuable as preparation for their roles in the airline. A key finding was that the new hires strongly recommended that improvisation training be incorporated into the airline's regular induction training programme. Specifically, participants felt the improvisation training improved their confidence, effectiveness, ability to adapt, spontaneity and comfort in successfully handling unique situations.Research limitations/implications - As with many case studies, the study presented here focuses on a single company for its data generation. Further, because of the realities of commercial life, the subject pool is quite small, i.e. due to the demands of their position, only seven new hires were available for the 12 hours needed to conduct the training, as well as the subsequent assessment activities. Nevertheless, the case study enabled the authors to gain meaningful insights into the utilisation of improvisation training in a real-world setting.Originality/value - The research makes several key contributions. First, it links theory and practice by demonstrating in a real world context the efficacy of framing service as theatre. Second, based on the service theatre literature, the paper details the utility of improvisation training as a means of preparing front-stage service employees for the rigours of their jobs. Finally, the research presents new, empirically based insights regarding the value and contribution of improvisation training in the services sector.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0309-0566			WOS:000265626600009

The dissociation constants for the dizinc complex of L2 (Zn(2)L2) binding to phosphate, pyrophosphate and commercially available complexometric indicators were determined under physiological pH [10 mm N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer at pH 7.4]. Colorimetric and fluorescence-based indicator displacement assays with selectivity for pyrophosphate over other anions were achieved with Zn(2)L2 as the receptor component. These assays show good response characteristics for quantification of pyrophosphate concentrations as low as 2.5 x 10(-6) m, suggesting their utility for measuring pyrophosphate levels in synovial fluid.

Since the hydraulic radius of nanochannels is comparable to the thickness of electric double layers, the enormous electric fields inherent to the latter generate transverse electromigrations causing charge-dependent solute distributions over the channel cross-section. As a consequence, the non-uniform fluid flow through nanochannels yields charge-dependent solute speeds enabling the separation of solutes by charge alone. In this chapter we develop a theoretical model of solute transport, dispersion and separation in electroosmotic and pressure-driven flows through nanofluidic channels. This model provides a basis for the optimization of solute separation in nanochannels in terms of selectivity and resolution as traditionally defined.									0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-60741-037-9	WOS:000273433900001

Unlike testing, formal verification can be used to certify that a component will behave correctly regardless of context, as long as that context satisfies component assumptions. Some verification systems for developing correct components in languages such as Java are simplified to be practical, but are not complete. Other systems that account for necessary semantic complications arising from underlying reference behavior demand non-trivial specification and verification. This paper describes an alternative. Under this approach, reusable components are specified, implemented, and verified in RESOLVE, a language with clean semantics, and are translated to Java. To improve confidence in the verification process, we are currently re-engineering the RESOLVE verification system itself with generated verified components.					11th International Conference on Software Reuse (ICSR 2009)11th International Conference on Software Reuse (ICSR 2009)	SEP 27-30, 2009SEP 27-30, 2009	Virginia Tech; Int Soc Adv Software Educ; Natl Sci Fdn; Software Generators; Reuse Software Engn; Pohang Univ Sci & TechnolVirginia Tech; Int Soc Adv Software Educ; Natl Sci Fdn; Software Generators; Reuse Software Engn; Pohang Univ Sci & Technol	Falls Church, VAFalls Church, VA	2	0	0	0	0	2			0302-9743		978-3-642-04210-2	WOS:000278805800002

S	Hallstrom, Jason O.; Soundarajan, Neelam						Edwards, SH; Kulczycki, G		Reusing Patterns through Design Refinement								FORMAL FOUNDATIONS OF REUSE AND DOMAIN ENGINEERING, PROCEEDINGS		Lecture Notes in Computer Science		5791				225	+					2009	2009	Refinement concepts, such as procedural and data refinement, are among the most important ideas of software engineering. In this paper, we investigate the idea of design refinement, the process of refining a set of design patterns to arrive at application-specific design components, and ultimately, to system implementations. The approach also enables designers to refine a given pattern to arrive at more specialized versions of that pattern-sub-patterns-thus enabling the creation of pattern hierarchies.We present three contributions: (i) We explore the concept of design refinement and consider what it means for such a refinement to be correct, in the sense of being faithful to the pattern being refined. (ii) We describe a two-part formalism for documenting patterns and subpatterns. A pattern contract captures the requirements and behavioral guarantees associated with a given pattern, while a subcontract captures the ways in which the pattern is specialized for use in a particular application or sub-pattern. Contracts and subcontracts serve as the basis for validating the correctness of a given refinement. (iii) We consider bow related patterns may be organized into suitable hierarchies based on the notion of design refinement. We focus on variations of the standard Observer pattern as examples. A key feature of our formalism is that while it enables us to specify patterns and sub-patterns precisely, it allows us to do so without compromising their flexibility.					11th International Conference on Software Reuse (ICSR 2009)11th International Conference on Software Reuse (ICSR 2009)	SEP 27-30, 2009SEP 27-30, 2009	Virginia Tech; Int Soc Adv Software Educ; Natl Sci Fdn; Software Generators; Reuse Software Engn; Pohang Univ Sci & TechnolVirginia Tech; Int Soc Adv Software Educ; Natl Sci Fdn; Software Generators; Reuse Software Engn; Pohang Univ Sci & Technol	Falls Church, VAFalls Church, VA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0302-9743		978-3-642-04210-2	WOS:000278805800022

This has led to the development of over 100 cannabimimetic aminoalkylindoles, and the development of SAR for these compounds. Later work demonstrated that the aminoalkyl moiety was not necessary, and could be replaced by a four-to six-membered alkyl chain without loss of affinity. Investigation of these indoles led to the discovery of a CB 2 selective ligand, 3-(1-naphthoyl)-N-propylindole. Subsequent work has provided several additional CB 2 selective indoles. On the basis of a proposed pharmacophore for the cannabimimetic indoles, a series of pyrroles and indenes were developed, some of which are potent cannabinoids. SAR for several series of pyrroles have been developed. Two groups have described cannabimimetic indenes, which have been employed as rigid models for the receptor interactions of cannabimimetic indoles with the CB 1 receptor. There is some evidence that the indoles bind to a somewhat different site on the receptor than traditional cannabinoids, and interact with the receptor primarily by aromatic stacking.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1567-2042(print)		978-1-60805-207-3(P)	BCI:BCI201600572122

We demonstrate that this instrument is also an effective technique for the detection of Au, Ag, and Cu nanoparticles within sol-gel derived silica films. Lastly, we show that the microthermal analyzer can also be used to measure thermal properties of bulk and film glassy materials, including thermal conductivity and probe penetration temperature.

The exploratory, theory-based, qualitative study design involved interviews with preschoolers (n=24) and their primary care providers (n=22) and childcare providers (n=2). Maps were used to qualitatively compare similarities in responses to questions regarding fruits and vegetables between a preschooler and her primary care provider and childcare provider. The concepts expressed by the preschoolers were shared minimally with their primary care providers and childcare providers. Further work is needed in understanding how to utilize primary care providers and childcare providers and the underlying preschool contextual setting to increase preschoolers' concepts and knowledge of fruits and vegetables.									0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-60741-596-1	WOS:000273339400010

For large tensile loadings, this effective Young's modulus is found to decrease significantly down to only 45% of its initial value, with a decrease rate which is found, here, to be nonlinear. The dependence with radius or chiral angle of this nonlinear decrease rate is studied. For all the tubes tested, we also find values of the initial Young's modulus in good agreement with those of previous studies, and a linear increase of the tubes' surface area for large axial deformations.									12	0	0	0	1	12			1536-383X			WOS:000262134000001

The payload consists of two wide field-of-view (FoV) instruments: a Low Energy Polarimeter (LEP) capable of polarization measurements in the energy range from 2-15 keV and a high energy polarimeter (Gamma-Ray Polarimeter Experiment or GRAPE) that would measure polarization in the 60-500 keV energy range. The POET spacecraft provides a zenith-pointed platform for maximizing the exposure to deep space. Spacecraft rotation provides a means of effectively dealing with any residual systematic effects in the polarization response. POET provides sufficient sensitivity and sky coverage to measure statistically significant polarization (for polarization levels in excess of 20%) for similar to 80 GRBs in a two-year mission. High energy polarization data would also be obtained for SGRs, solar flares, pulsars and other sources of astronomical interest.					6th Huntsville Symposium on Gamma-Ray Burst6th Huntsville Symposium on Gamma-Ray Burst	OCT 20-23, 2008OCT 20-23, 2008	Gamma Ray Burst Monitor; Swift; Univ Alabama; Curry FdnGamma Ray Burst Monitor; Swift; Univ Alabama; Curry Fdn	Huntsville, ALHuntsville, AL	6	0	0	0	0	6			0094-243X		978-0-7354-0670-4	WOS:000267717300017

We find that for the same initial Lorentz factor, the reverse shock becomes progressively weaker with increasing magnetization a (the Poynting-to-kinetic energy flux ratio), and the shock becomes a rarefaction wave when a exceeds a critical value, sigma(c), defined by the balance between the magnetic pressure in the ejecta and the thermal pressure in the forward shock. In the rarefaction wave regime, we find that the rarefied region is accelerated to a Lorentz factor that is significantly larger than the initial value. This acceleration mechanism is due to the strong magnetic pressure in the ejecta.					6th Huntsville Symposium on Gamma-Ray Burst6th Huntsville Symposium on Gamma-Ray Burst	OCT 20-23, 2008OCT 20-23, 2008	Gamma Ray Burst Monitor; Swift; Univ Alabama; Curry FdnGamma Ray Burst Monitor; Swift; Univ Alabama; Curry Fdn	Huntsville, ALHuntsville, AL	0	0	0	0	0	0			0094-243X		978-0-7354-0670-4	WOS:000267717300055

Meegan, C; Gehrels, N; Kouveliotou, C		Tracing Cosmic Chemical Evolution with GRBs								GAMMA-RAY BUSTS		AIP Conference Proceedings		1133				464	466					2009	2009	Abundance measurements with bright background light sources, such as quasars and GRBs, probe the large-scale distribution and the physical state of the baryonic components of cosmic gas- star - dark matter systems. Not all baryons inferred from big bang nucleosynthesis and the CMB are accounted for in the local Universe, and only a small fraction is trapped in compact objects. Most baryons probably reside in a warm-hot tenuous filamentary structure that traces the distribution of dark matter. The chemo-dynamical evolution of these baryons can be studied with absorption lines from bright, distant sources, in particular GRBs. Supernovae and galaxies are bright enough to be traced to high redshifts, but the diffuse gas in their vicinity is not luminous enough to be detectable in emission at cosmological distances. GRBs are ideal tools to pinpoint sites of cosmic star formation to very large distances, and simultaneously probe their hosts on galactic scales. Their large brightness allows abundances to be measured in low luminosity proto-galaxies that would otherwise not be found in ground-based surveys, and to trace abundances to the era of re-ionization at z > 6.					6th Huntsville Symposium on Gamma-Ray Burst6th Huntsville Symposium on Gamma-Ray Burst	OCT 20-23, 2008OCT 20-23, 2008	Gamma Ray Burst Monitor; Swift; Univ Alabama; Curry FdnGamma Ray Burst Monitor; Swift; Univ Alabama; Curry Fdn	Huntsville, ALHuntsville, AL	1	0	0	0	0	1			0094-243X		978-0-7354-0670-4	WOS:000267717300111

Our contribution has applied GXLs as a processing medium for the fractionation and deposition of metallic nanoparticles (Pt, Pd, Ag, Au) and quantum dots (CdSe/ZnS). The tunable nature of the GXLs provides advantages over conventional solvents, and enables rapid, precise, and scalable size-dependant fractionation of nanoparticles into uniform populations (less than +/- 0.5 nm in diameter). The wide range of accessible solvent strengths and facile removal of the CO(2), substantially reduces the amount of solvent needed for conventional anti-solvent size fractionation techniques and facilitates solvent recycling. We have also taken advantage of the reduced surface tension and interfacial forces exhibited by GXLs to produce wide-area, low defect nanoparticle arrays. Each of these nanoparticle processing applications is governed by the inter-particle interactions; dispersive and steric repulsion forces, resulting from the solvation forces between the nanoparticle stabilizing ligands and CO(2) expanded liquid medium. To better understand this system, we have developed an interaction energy modeling approach to determine the interparticle attractive and repulsive forces that control nanoparticle dispersibility through variations in the properties of the GXL medium.

Traditional sensing methods require the transmitters of the secondary users to be silent while spectrum monitoring is performed. Statistics that are derived easily in a communications receiver have the potential to permit a level of spectrum monitoring while the receiver is demodulating and decoding a packet, so that it is not necessary to silence the secondary transmitters. The proposed techniques for spectrum monitoring can supplement existing methods and reduce the amount of time that secondary users must refrain from communicating.

J	Schweisinger, Todd; Svenson, Erik J.; Murdoch, Lawrence C.								Introduction to Hydromechanical Well Tests in Fractured Rock Aquifers								GROUND WATER				47	1			69	79		10.1111/j.1745-6584.2008.00501.x			JAN-FEB 2009	2009	This article introduces hydromechanical well tests as a viable field method for characterizing fractured rock aquifers. These tests involve measuring and analyzing small displacements along with pressure transients. Recent developments in equipment and analyses have simplified hydromechanical well tests, and this article describes initial field results and interpretations during slug and constant-rate pumping tests conducted at a site underlain by fractured biotite gneiss in South Carolina. The field data are characterized by displacements of 0.3 mu m to more than 10 mu m during head changes up to 10 m. Displacements are a hysteretic function of hydraulic head in the wellbore, with displacements late in a well test always exceeding those at similar wellbore pressures early in the test. Displacement measurements show that hydraulic aperture changes during well tests, and both scaling analyses and field data suggest that T changed by a few percent per meter of drawdown during slug and pumping tests at our field site. Preliminary analyses suggest that displacement data can be used to improve estimates of storativity and to reduce nonuniqueness during hydraulic well tests involving single wells.									17	0	0	3	0	17			0017-467X			WOS:000262151200011	18823402

B	Wu, Yonnie; Heim, Kyle; Vasquez, Erick						Bentely, JV; Keller, MA		Mammalian Cell Sporulation - A Possible Link to Disease and Aging								HANDBOOK ON LONGEVITY: GENETICS, DIET AND DISEASE								429	452					2009	2009	This chapter reviews the physiochemical properties of mammalian spores and straw cells, which develop in vitro from the transformation of normal mammalian cells exposed to desiccative conditions. We hypothesize that this transformation is directly linked with aging and aging related diseases. Unlike many of the current damage related aging theories involving damage to DNA and protein molecules (leading to improper gene expression and protein function), this transformation is an active process at the cellular level. The metamorphosis of a normal cell into a mammalian spore is an inherited survival mechanism that can cause the loss of the body's most basic life-sustaining unit, the cell.Mammalian spores are extremely prevalent. It is estimated that a typical person currently possesses billions of spores in their blood; the amount of spores may fluctuate in a day, perhaps influenced by physiological conditions such as diet and exercise that affect the overall sporulation stress. These mammalian spores form long extensive and extremely hydrophilic filamentous network that could contribute to blood viscosity. Blood cholesterol level may be increased from sporulation of billions of cells per day.The metamorphosis of a mammalian spore from a normal mammalian cell is marked by a variety of distinct physical changes. First, the nuclei is broken into many pieces and reassembled within a tiny tube shaped structure. Second, tubular walls are constructed. Finally, upon the reintroduction of water, mammalian spores revert to normal mammalian cells and begin to divide. The early steps of this transformation resemble the development of apoptotic bodies. However, instead of destroying itself, the cell enters a robust spore-like cell survival phase, allowing it to remain viable under severe external conditions. Mammalian spores construct a strong cell wall using sulfated-glucose polymers and glycosylated acidic proteins, allowing it to withstand harsh treatment such as UV-C radiation.A direct inverse relationship is displayed between the number of mammalian spores present in the blood of 9 domestic animals and these animals' average lifespan. The number of mammalian spores present in the heart and lung tissues, as well as excreted in the urine, also increases with the age of the mammal. This increased production of mammalian spores may play a role in disrupting normal cell and organ function. The large number of mammalian spores produced by a variety of tissues makes this transformation appear to be a natural physiological process embedded within a cell's environmental response machinery. The universal nature of mammalian spores and their mobility within the bloodstream allow them to affect many parts of the body. The mobile character of these cells displays a potential link to longevity and the development of aging-related diseases, including the metastasis of various cancers.Water is the most essential component for cell survival. Throughout evolution organisms have developed many novel adaptations for particular environmental deficiencies and conditions. The formation of spores may be an early form of environmental adaptation for single celled organisms. However, in multicellular organisms the mammalian spore survival mechanism may not be beneficial because the organism loses necessary functional cells. Inhibiting mammalian spore biogenesis would prevent the depletion of normal healthy cells, as well as the spread of potentially harmful cells, and therefore improve mammalian longevity. Intervention of sporulation using membrane interacting molecules is discussed. Exogenous phosphotidylcholines (DOPC) significantly promote dehydration-induced sporulation while other phospholipids (DOPG, DOPE, DOPA, and DOPS) are ineffective.									0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-60741-075-1	WOS:000273336200018

Recent PIC simulations of relativistic electron-ion (or electron-positron) jets injected into a stationary medium show that particle acceleration occurs within the downstream jet. In collisionless, relativistic shocks, particle (electron, positron, and ion) acceleration is due to plasma waves and their associated instabilities (e.g., the Weibel (filamentation) instability) created in the shock region. The simulations show that the Weibel instability is responsible for generating and amplifying highly non-uniform, small-scale magnetic fields. These fields contribute to the electron's transverse deflection behind the jet head. The resulting "jitter" radiation from deflected electrons has different properties compared to synchrotron radiation, which assumes a uniform magnetic field. Jitter radiation may be important for understanding the complex time evolution and/or spectra in gamma-ray bursts, relativistic jets in general, and supernova remnants.					4th International Symposium on High Energy Gamma-Ray Astronomy4th International Symposium on High Energy Gamma-Ray Astronomy	JUL 07-AUG 11, 2008JUL 07-AUG 11, 2008	Max Planck Soc; German Fed Minist Educ & Res; ISEG; PHOTONICS CoMax Planck Soc; German Fed Minist Educ & Res; ISEG; PHOTONICS Co	Heidelberg, GERMANYHeidelberg, GERMANY	13	0	0	0	0	13			0094-243X		978-0-7354-0616-2	WOS:000263556300120

This minimally intrusive technique allows liquid/vapor interactions to be observed throughout the liquid core and compensation chamber. A low conductivity ceramic was used for the wick and ammonia as the working fluid. Results indicate that buoyancy driven flows, both two-phase and single-phase, play essential roles in evacuating excess heat from the core, which explains the several differences in performance between horizontal and vertical orientations of the evaporator. This study also found no discernable effect of the pre-start fill level of the compensation chamber on thermal performance during startup at moderate and high heat loads.

Individual Differences in the Ability to Fake on Personality Measures								HUMAN PERFORMANCE				22	1			86	103	PII 907765803	10.1080/08959280802541039			2009	2009	This study provides a partial test of the model of faking proposed by McFarland and Ryan (2000) by examining the degree to which self-monitoring, knowledge of the constructs being measured, job familiarity, and openness to ideas account for variance in ability to fake on a personality measure. Undergraduates (N = 342) completed a modified version of the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised under both honest and faking instructions. In addition, some participants were asked to fake good and others were asked to fake toward the requirements of a specific job (i.e., accountant). Consistent with prior research, the fake good manipulation was found to increase scores on 8 of the 9 personality variables. In contrast, the fake accountant manipulation resulted in a personality profile consistent with a priori hypotheses in which some personality scores were significantly increased whereas others were significantly decreased. Results also revealed that the individual difference variables explained a significant portion of the variance in the ability to fake and that the two faking conditions produced different relations with these individual difference variables. As hypothesized, the participants' openness to ideas was a significant predictor of the ability to fake like an accountant ( = .22) but not the ability to fake good. In contrast, the participants' knowledge of the constructs being measured was a significant predictor of the ability to fake good ( = .18) but not the ability to fake like an accountant. We conclude by elaborating on the importance of using a hypothesis testing approach in the assessment of the relations between personality variables and job performance.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0895-9285			WOS:000262472500005

Plantlets immersed in liquid were all hyperhydric, those from rayon were intermediate, and plantlets on polyester fiber were least hyperhydric. Middle and high density fiber plantlets had relatively high biomass (FW, DW) and high MR, along with lower hyperhydricity. A second experiment was conducted comparing liquid medium, agar and middle density polyester at different initial media volumes - 30 ml and 20 ml. Plantlets immersed in liquid had the highest biomass (FW and DW) except for S. baicalensis, but were all hyperhydric. Agar and fiber grown plantlets had relatively high biomass, higher MR and were less hyperhydric compared to plantlets immersed in liquid.					1st International Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Conference on Culinary Herbs1st International Medicinal and Aromatic Plants Conference on Culinary Herbs	APR 30, 2009APR 30, 2009		Antalya, TURKEYAntalya, TURKEY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-90-6605-468-4	WOS:000305620000019

Batsch] fails to cease growth and enter dormancy under dormancy-inducing conditions. The EVG locus has been mapped and sequenced in wild-type peach. Six dormancy associated MADS-box (DAM) genes have been found in this locus and proposed as candidates for the regulation of growth cessation and terminal bud formation in peach in response to dormancy-inducing conditions. To study the duplication history of the DAM genes, we identified two BACs corresponding to the EVG locus in apricot (P. armeniaca L.) by southern hybridization. We sequenced and annotated a 70 kb region that contains five predicted DAM genes in apricot. We compared the peach EVG locus by global pair-wise alignment with the 70 kb apricot sequence, and the Arabidopsis [Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh.] and poplar (Populus trichocarpa Torr. & A. Gray) sequenced genomes. The phylogenetic relationships among DAM genes were also studied. As expected, there was a strong similarity between peach and apricot genomic sequence with a conserved order and orientation of orthologous genes. The peach EVG locus had sequence similarity to three loci in poplar reflecting a different duplication history. Greater synteny between the peach EVG locus and the poplar loci was found, than between peach and Arabidopsis. DAM gene phylogeny and locus distribution in the respective genomes indicates that duplication of the DAM genes occurred after Prunus and poplar divergence. Our data suggest that poplar is a better model than Arabidopsis for predicting gene presence and order with Prunus although the large scale duplication history of poplar will complicate the comparison.					1st International Symposium on Biotechnology of Fruit Species - BIOTECHFRUIT1st International Symposium on Biotechnology of Fruit Species - BIOTECHFRUIT	JUL 14, 2009JUL 14, 2009		Dresden, GERMANYDresden, GERMANY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-90-6605-612-1	WOS:000305708800071

One of the features that distinguishes the affordance based approach from function based approaches is that affordances are form dependent. Designers can take advantage of this property during conceptual design by analyzing how well the form (or structure) of individual concepts satisfy the desired and undesired (positive and negative) affordances for the project. In other work, we have introduced a matrix based tool called the Affordance Structure Matrix (ASM). However, in the products we have studied to date, typically the desired and undesired affordances at the system level are mapped to individual parts at the component level. Our focus in this paper is utilizing the ASM to study how the satisfaction of affordances propagates hierarchically upward from the component level to the sub-system level, and finally system level. A hair-dryer is used as an example system to demonstrate the approach. We illustrate how component level affordances propagate upward from the component to the sub-system and system level, and how new affordances emerge at higher levels of hierearchy.					17th International Conference on Engineering Design17th International Conference on Engineering Design	AUG 24-27, 2009AUG 24-27, 2009	Stanford Univ, Ctr Design Res; Design SocStanford Univ, Ctr Design Res; Design Soc	Stanford Univ, Stanford, CAStanford Univ, Stanford, CA	1	0	0	0	0	1					978-1-904670-09-4	WOS:000301954800035

Four consumer products are analyzed using a product tear-down strategy, and function structures from the literature are utilized where available. System level, sub-system level, and component level function structures are studied for each product. Affordance structures and Affordance-Structure Matrices (ASMs) are also generated for each product. Comparisons are made between function structures and affordance structures at each level of abstraction based on the number and types of entities and number and types of flows in each representation. During the course of the experiments, additional metrics were added to the ASM including total helpful relationships, total harmful relationships, and the percent difference between helpful and harmful relationships. Function structures were also formatted to show force flows as distinct from energy flows to reduce ambiguity. The data from the sub-system and component level function structures show that they are consistently dominated by energy and material flows (50% and 48% respectively), while information flows account for only 2% of the flows captured. The data from the affordance structures show that more helpful than harmful relationships tend to be captured (between 60% and 80%). Quantitatively, the component level function structures captured on average 24 functions and 44 flows, while comparable ASMs captured on average 20 components, 14 affordances, and 36 intra-domain relationships. Qualitatively, the principal advantage of the function based representations is the ability to capture different kinds of flows between functions. The principal advantage of the affordance based representations is the ability to distinguish between helpful and harmful relationships and specific user groups.					17th International Conference on Engineering Design17th International Conference on Engineering Design	AUG 24-27, 2009AUG 24-27, 2009	Stanford Univ, Ctr Design Res; Design SocStanford Univ, Ctr Design Res; Design Soc	Stanford Univ, Stanford, CAStanford Univ, Stanford, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-904670-09-4	WOS:000301954800037

For applications that do not require adherence to the standard, it may be desirable to use forward error correction coding with CCK, but the bit-to-symbol mappings used in IEEE 802.11b degrade the performance of most standard binary codes. We show that a standard binary convolutional code performs much better with alternative bit mappings, and we demonstrate that chip scrambling gives additional improvement.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1089-7798	1558-2558		WOS:000262540800011

Participants explored either a real maze or a virtual maze using either natural walking or simulated walking. Reported scores for measures of overall simulator sickness, disorientation, nausea, and occulomotor discomfort were all higher in the natural walking condition than either the simulated walking or real world conditions. This indicates that simulated walking is a better choice for reducing simulator sickness during tasks requiring a navigationally complex environment and a long amount of time.

IEEE					Parallelizing Two Classes of Neuromorphic Models on the Cell Multicore Architecture								IJCNN: 2009 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS, VOLS 1- 6		IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)						2862	2869					2009	2009	There is a significant interest in the research community to develop large scale, high performance implementations of cortical models. These have the potential to provide significantly stronger information processing capabilities than current computing algorithms. At present we are investigating the implementation of six neuromorphic computational models on a large Sony Play Station 3 cluster at the Air Force research lab. These six models span two classes of neuromorphic algorithms: hierarchical Bayesian and spiking neural networks. In this paper we have presented the performance gain of these six neuromorphic computational models for implementations on the Cell multicore processor on the Play Station 3. We show that the Cell multicore architecture can provide significant performance gains for these models. We compare the performance gains of the two classes and see that the hierarchical Bayesian class provides higher speedups than the spiking network class in general. This is primarily due to the higher computational load per node in the former class. Our results indicate that the Cell processor based Play Station 3 would provide a good platform for the large scale implementation of the classes of neuromorphic models examined.

In this paper, the out-of-plane vibrations of the piezoelectrically actuated microcantilever are experimentally investigated. The microcantilever is covered with a piezoelectric layer on its top surface through which it can be excited by applying the voltage to the piezoelectric actuator. The nonlinear frequency response of the microcantilever is studied and shift in natural frequency due to nonlinearity is examined. By observing the subharmonics of the fundamental frequencies at 2X and 3X, it is experimentally shown that there exist cubic and quadratic nonlinearities in the microcantilever. A mathematical model based on these experimental tests is then proposed and verified. The out-of-plane measurements provide the ability to observe both transversal and torsional modes. In addition, the modes in which the microcantilever acts like a plate are observed.

Lattice dynamics is employed for the calculation of the phonon scattering properties as a function of strain. Cauchy-Born rule is used to model the deformed configuration of the atoms. The effective thermal conductivity of the nanocomposite material is modeled by using a modified effective medium approximation (EMA) approach. The strain effects are incorporated into the modified EMA through the strain dependent phonon mean free path. The effective thermal conductivity of the strained nanocomposite material is calculated for different characteristic lengths of the Si component. The results show that er 2% tensile strain can reduce the effective thermal conductivity by more than 10%.

B	Reba, Marilyn; Pargas, Roy						Reed, RH; Berque, DA; Prey, JC		Using Tablet PCs as Interactive Web-based Instruction Tools in Freshman Calculus								IMPACT OF TABLET PCS AND PEN-BASED TECHNOLOGY ON EDUCATION: EVIDENCE AND OUTCOMES, 2008								121	128					2009	2009	Too many students in freshman calculus are unprepared for the pace at which new concepts are introduced, are unable to implement prerequisite algebra skills, and are unwilling to seek answers to their questions in front of their classmates. We report on how the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Clemson University has used Tablet PCs and the Web-based interactive software, MessageGrid, to address these issues over the past three semesters. Pen-technology in large-enrollment, content-heavy calculus courses provides new ways to communicate with struggling students: projection of anonymous student-inked submissions; "personalized" feedback on group activities; student-generated audio-video pod-casts; and, in the fall 2008 semester, quick identification and remediation of weak algebra skills via inking on Mathpad. We report a higher percentage of students able to enroll in second-semester calculus. Despite this emerging evidence of greater student success and despite very positive faculty and student perceptions, it is not easy to expand the set of math faculty willing to try the technology. Yet, interest in Tablet PCs (and MessageGrid) is flourishing at Clemson, due to our 2007 Hewlett-Packard Leadership Grant, which placed Tablet PCs into a multi-disciplinary technology classroom and attracted faculty from other departments willing to invest time to learn new pedagogical techniques.									0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-55753-531-3	WOS:000294003700016

The main tool is an energy estimate which is uniform in the surface tension parameter. Before establishing estimates, we reformulate the problem using suitable variables and an isothermal parameterization. With these variables and parameterizations, estimates for the water wave with or without surface tension are straightforward. In particular, this provides a new proof of existence of irrotational water waves in three space dimensions.									31	0	0	0	0	31			0022-2518			WOS:000265899500001

To demonstrate the advantage of the closed-loop process in improving cure uniformity, detailed models and discussions of the irradiation process, the robotics and the control strategy are presented.Findings - A simulation-based comparison of the closed-loop robotic curing with the open-loop robotic curing clearly shows the benefits of using thermal signature feedback in improving cure level uniformity.Originality/value - This is a new approach proposed to exploit immerging technology and improve the efficiency of energy use in an automotive manufacturing process without sacrificing product quality.					11th International Conference on Climbing and Walking Robots (CLAWAR 2008)11th International Conference on Climbing and Walking Robots (CLAWAR 2008)	SEP 08-10, 2008SEP 08-10, 2008		Coimbra, PORTUGALCoimbra, PORTUGAL	6	0	0	0	0	6			0143-991X			WOS:000268219200013

Delivery systems for this information have traditionally been through extension agents in the USA but the internet is playing a larger role. IPM in developing countries, such as those in Southeast Asia, has been addressed most effectively through massive training of farmers through farmer field schools and farmer participatory research in the region. S.E. Asia is characterized by large numbers of farmers cultivating small plots. Production systems involve substantial amounts of labor inputs, which often put farm laborers at risk from exposure to harmful chemicals. Mechanical devices that replace labor in developed countries are not common in the S.E. Asia region. Technological advances have made an impact mainly through improved plant varieties and cultural practices to enhance yields. IPM training has taken hold throughout the region as a means to establish the farmer as the primary decision-maker and to equip him or her with an understanding of the critical relationship between agricultural output and field ecology. Training programs in all S.E. Asian countries are aggressively spreading the message to "grow a healthy crop" as the first step in establishing sound IPM programs. Results from some IPM programs are presented and discussed but the list is not all inclusive and is always evolving and changing with the farmers' crop mix and increased knowledge of the agricultural ecosystem.									4	0	0	4	0	4					978-1-4020-8989-3(H)	BCI:BCI200900433761

Recently, we have reported successful boron doping into single-walled CNTs (SWNTs) and also revealed its correlation with superconductivity. In the present study, we report results of pressure-applied magnetization measurements in films consisting of ropes of boron-doped SWNTs. It reveals that T(c) and magnitude for Meissner effect is mostly independent of applied pressure, while magnitude of graphite diamagnetism drastically increases as pressure increases. We also report result of resistance measurements in the samples and also correlation of boron doped SWNTs with multi-walled CNTs, in which we reported superconductivity previously.

J	Shappell, Scott; Wiegmann, Douglas								A Methodology for Assessing Safety Programs Targeting Human Error in Aviation								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AVIATION PSYCHOLOGY				19	3			252	269		10.1080/10508410902983904			2009	2009	There is a need to develop an effective methodology for generating and evaluating intervention strategies that map current and proposed safety programs onto well-established types of human error. Toward these ends, we conducted 2 studies using recommendations from National Transportation Safety Board accident investigations and two joint Federal Aviation Administration and industry working groups. The goal of these studies was to identify the types of interventions commonly recommended by these agencies, as well as to develop a framework for evaluating the potential impact of specific safety initiatives that target human error in aviation. The results suggest there are at least 5 approaches to reducing human errors associated with aviation accidents. However, not all are equally utilized by the agencies whose safety recommendations we evaluated in this study. Therefore, we propose a framework called the Human Factors Intervention Matrix as a potential tool for evaluating current aviation safety programs, as well as generating more comprehensive interventions in the future.									4	2	0	0	0	6			1050-8414			WOS:000270515200004

Problems associated with testing, debugging, and profiling are key contributing factors. While network simulators have proven useful, they are unable to capture the subtleties of underlying hardware, nor the dynamics of wireless signal propagation and interference; and physical experimentation remains a necessity. To this end, developers increasingly rely on shared deployments exposed for physical experimentation. Sensor network testbeds are under development across the world. We present a complementary testbed architecture that derives its novelty from three characteristics. First, the system is interactive; users can profile source and network level components across a network in real time, as well as inject transient state faults and external network traffic. Second, the system is source-centric; it enables automated source code analysis, instrumentation, and compilation. Finally, the design is open; developers can extend the set of exposed inter faces as appropriate to particular projects without modifying the underlying middleware. We present the testbed design and implementation, a graphical user interface, a shell-based macro programming interface, example scenarios that illustrate their use, and discuss the testbed's application in the research and teaching activities at client institutions.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1550-1477			WOS:000263995900001

We propose an approach that uses multicast communications and requires fewer encryptions than pairwise communications. The network is partitioned into multicast regions; each region is managed by a sensor node chosen to act as a keyserver. The keyservers solicit nodes in their neighborhood to join the local multicast tree. The keyserver generates a binary tree of keys to maintain communication within the multicast region using a shared key. Our approach supports a distributed key agreement protocol that identifies the compromised keys and supports membership changes with minimum system overhead. We evaluate the overhead of our approach by using the number of messages and encryptions to estimate power consumption. Using data from field tests of a military surveillance application, we show that our multicast approach needs fewer encryptions than pair-wise keying approaches. We also show that this scheme is capable of thwarting many common attacks.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1550-1477			WOS:000263995900002

In this paper, we present a criterion for determining whether or not a surveillance sensor network is viable. We use this criterion to compare methods for extending the effective lifetime of the sensor network. The life extension methods we consider are local adaptations that reduce the energy drain on individual nodes. They are communications range management, node repositioning, and data agreement. Simulations of a surveillance scenario quantify the utility of these methods. Our results indicate that data agreement provides the most improvement in network longevity, and communications range management is also useful. Repositioning nodes to reduce the power needed for communications is dependent on the amount of attenuation experienced by the node's communications signal and the volume of traffic between nodes. When these factors are considered, node repositioning is an effective strategy for network life extension. Synergies between the energy conservation approaches are also explored.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1550-1329			WOS:000263995900003

Cloned nodes subvert sensor network processing from within. In a companion paper [2], we show how to detect and remove clones from sensor networks using random key predistribution security measures. Keys that are present on the cloned nodes are detected by using authentication statistics based on key usage frequency. For consistency with existing random key predistribution literature, and ease of explanation, the network in that paper used an Erdos-Renyi topology. In the Erdos-Renyi topology, the probability of connection between any two nodes in the network is uniform. Since the communications ranges of sensor nodes are limited, this topology is flawed. This article applies the clone detection approach from [2] to more realistic network topologies. Grid and ad hoc topologies reflect the node connectivity patterns of networks of nodes with range limits. We provide analytical methods for choosing detection thresholds that accurately detect clones. We use simulations to verify our method. In particular we find the limitations of this approach, such as the number of nodes that can be inserted without being detected.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1550-1329	1550-1477		WOS:000265991300002

The South Carolina Merit Scholarship: Strategies Used by Engineering Students to Keep their LIFE Scholarship								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION				25	6	SI		1249	1256					2009	2009	We have examined the effects of South Carolina's LIFE merit scholarship on the decisions of engineering students at Clemson University. In Spring 2007, we interviewed 16 current and former engineering majors to learn more about their experiences negotiating their LIFE scholarship eligibility. While the LIFE scholarship influenced their decisions to attend Clemson, it had little influence on their decision to major in engineering. The students used a number of strategies to retain or regain their scholarship eligibility, including being selective about courses and professors, seeking grade redemption, attending summer school, studying harder, and seeking extra help. While merit-based scholarships seem to influence whether engineering students engage in certain behaviors, their reasons for doing so seem to be related less to financial issues and more to the belief that grades are important, a belief which is reinforced by the scholarship rules.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0949-149X			WOS:000275295400020

Furthermore, the results show that the hypothesized second-order multidimensional model is the best-fit and most parsimonious model.Originality/value - The paper contributes to the knowledge on supply chain risk management by providing empirically validated measures for the LBCP construct.

J	Rao, Apparao M.								Electrical actuation and detection of mechanical oscillations in cantilevered multi-walled carbon nanotubes								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOTECHNOLOGY				6	5-6			436	441					2009	2009	A novel detection scheme, called the Harmonic Detection of Resonance (HDR) method, is described for measuring mechanical oscillations in nano-sized cantilevers under ambient conditions. HDR overcomes the problem of parasitic capacitance, which in the past has significantly limited the performance of capacitive sensors, by measuring resonances at higher harmonics (integer multiples) of the driving frequency. Individual multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) were manipulated to serve as single-end clamped (diving board geometry) cantilevers and driven into resonance using a sharpened tungsten probe tip as the counter electrode. Two geometries between the MWNT and the probe tip were tested and HDR was found to work equally well for both geometries. Importantly, the HDR method has the advantage of being entirely electrical, both in actuation and detection, and thus is straightforward to integrate into standard CMOS technology.

A simple and robust linear eddy-viscosity formulation for curved and rotating flows								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NUMERICAL METHODS FOR HEAT & FLUID FLOW				19	6-7			745	776		10.1108/09615530910972995			2009	2009	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a new eddy-viscosity formulation designed to exhibit a correct response to streamline Curvature and flow rotation. The formulation is implemented into a linear k-epsilon turbulence model with a two-layer near-wall treatment in a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver.Design/methodology/approach - A simple, robust formula is developed for the eddy-viscosity that is curvature/rotation sensitive and also satisfies realizability and invariance principles. The new model is tested on several two- and three-dimensional problems, including rotating channel flow, U-bend flow and internally cooled turbine airfoil conjugate heat transfer. Predictions are compared to those with popular eddy-viscosity models.Findings - Converged solutions to a variety of turbulent flow problems are obtained with no additional computational expense over existing two-equation models. In all cases, results with the new model are superior to two other popular k-epsilon model variants, especially for regions in which rapid rotation or strong streamline curvature exists.Research limitations/implications - The approach adopted here for linear eddy-viscosity models may be extended in a straightforward manner to non-linear eddy-viscosity or explicit algebraic stress models.Practical implications - The new model is a simple "plug-in" formula that contains important physics not included in most linear eddy-viscosity models and is easy to implement in most flow solvers.Originality/value - The present model for curved and rotating flows is developed without the need for second derivatives of velocity in the formulation, which are known to present difficulties with unstructured meshes.									11	0	0	0	0	11			0961-5539	1758-6585		WOS:000271353200003		
J	Zhou, Yi; Omar, Mohammed								PIXEL-LEVEL FUSION FOR INFRARED AND VISIBLE ACQUISITIONS								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPTOMECHATRONICS				3	1			41	53		10.1080/15599610902717835			2009	2009	This article presents a unique combined routine to fuse Long Wave Infrared (7.5-13 micron) with visible (0.38-0.78 micron) acquisitions, and to track pedestrians and road information in night or low light driving scenarios. Three fusion levels are presented and discussed: pixel-level, feature-level and decision-level. A pixel-level fusion is then used, through a novel combination of an adaptive weighting algorithm for un-saturated data points, and a PCA statistics for saturated pixels. The registration is done at the hardware level with Gaussian smoothing, while the smoothed histograms provide initial threshold values. The proposed routine is then applied for different night-time driving scenarios, further compared with the tracking results for non-fused thermal imagery from a commercial night-vision module. The fused imagery coupled with the proposed pre and post-processing provide complete detection of reflective and emitting objects with better shape retrieval and orientation prediction, computed and judged through objects morphology. The result of current work is an enhanced passive display for: passing vehicles with glare, pedestrians and non-emitting road features, with its motion predicted.									5	1	0	0	0	6			1559-9612			WOS:000270085600004		
J	Shatanawi, Khaldoun; Biro, Szabolcs; Thodesen, Carl; Amirkhanian, Serji								Effects of water activation of crumb rubber on the properties of crumb rubber-modified binders								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PAVEMENT ENGINEERING				10	4			289	297		10.1080/10298430802169424			2009	2009	Hot water activation of crumb rubber has been suggested as a method of improving compatibility between crumb rubber and asphalt binder. This procedure removes light oil fractions present in the crumb rubber particles, thus decreasing segregation occurring between rubber particles and binder.For this research, a PG 64-22 binder was modified with four different crumb rubber sources at concentration of 15% by weight of binder. Binder properties were evaluated for virgin binders, water-activated crumb rubber-modified (CRM) binders, and for non-activated CRM binders. CRM surface morphologies were studied using a scanning electron microscope, molecular size distributions of modified binders were determined using gel permeation chromatography, while storage stability was evaluated by cigar tube testing.Rheological properties of the CRM binder were investigated; improved phase separation properties were observed following water activation, however, these improvements did not result in improved rheological properties of the activated CRM binder.									4	1	0	0	0	5			1029-8436			WOS:000270089100006

Laboratory investigation of moisture damage in rubberised asphalt mixtures containing reclaimed asphalt pavement								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PAVEMENT ENGINEERING				10	5			319	328		10.1080/10298430802169432			2009	2009	In many parts of the world, highway officials are utilising crumb rubber and reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) in order to save money, protect the environment, and improve the life of asphalt pavement. However, due to the use of these materials, the effects of moisture damage should be investigated for rubberised asphalt concrete (RAC) mixtures containing RAP. The objective of this research involved investigating the moisture susceptibility of RAC containing RAP. The testing conducted included the determination of binder viscosity, toughness and indirect tensile strength (ITS) analysis. Several mixtures containing different crumb rubber types, two different RAP sources and various percentages of rubber and RAP were evaluated. The results indicated that, in general, the additional of RAP was beneficial in improving the ITS values and reducing the moisture susceptibility of the mixture although the addition of crumb rubber had a slightly negative effect.									26	0	0	0	0	26			1029-8436			WOS:000270977700002		
J	Gandhi, Tejash; Akisetty, Chandrakiran; Amirkhanian, Serji								Laboratory evaluation of warm asphalt binder aging characteristics								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PAVEMENT ENGINEERING				10	5			353	359		10.1080/10298430802342724			2009	2009	As warm asphalt has been gaining increasing popularity in recent years, there are still several characteristics of warm asphalt, which are unknown. While several studies have been conducted to analyse the performance of warm asphalt mixtures, aging characteristics of warm-mix asphalt (WMA) binders are not known in great detail. This paper presents the results of a study to evaluate the aging characteristics of WMA binders artificially aged in the rolling thin film oven (RTFO) and the pressure aging vessel. RTFO aging was performed at 163 degrees C and a lower temperature to simulate warm asphalt aging. The results of this study indicated that reducing the aging temperature reduced the aging index and increased the m-values, but had no significant effects on G*/sin delta, G*sin delta and stiffness of the binders. Also, the addition of warm asphalt additives significantly increased the G*/sin delta values and lowered the m-values of the binders.									12	0	0	0	2	12			1029-8436			WOS:000270977700005

However, the mechanism by which the interaction between the asphalt base binder and the CRM blends added takes place has not been fully characterised. In this study, the surface areas of CRM were at first measured using the Brunauer, Emmett and Teller ( BET) tester. Second, 108 CRM binders were produced using different combinations of CRM blend variables and mixing conditions and consequently tested for their viscosity at 135 degrees C. The influence of the surface area and the average size of the CRM blends on the viscosity of the CRM binders was statistically investigated. Results from this study indicated that: (1) the surface area of the ambient CRM is almost twice as large as that of the cryogenic CRM, leading to an increase in the viscosity up to 16-58% over cryogenic CRM binders and (2) the viscosity of the CRM binders has a moderate correlation with both the surface area and the average size of the CRM blends, but is prevailingly influenced by the average size of the CRM blends.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1029-8436			WOS:000270977700007

Reducing heat dissipation and utilizing the unabsorbed part of the solar spectrum are the key driving forces for the development of nanostructure-based solar cells. Unrealistic assumptions involved in theoretical work and the tendency of stretching observed experimental results are the primary reasons why quantum phenomena-based nanostructures solar cells are unlikely to play a significant role in the manufacturing of future generations of PV modules. Similar to the invention of phase shift masks (to beat the conventional diffraction limit of optical lithography) clever design concepts need to be invented to take advantage of quantum-based nanostructures.

N., 2003. The link between supply chain and financial performance. Supply Chain Management Review, November/December, 40-47). The focus on integrating functional internal processes has expanded to include the need for integrating these with external processes of business partners (Edwards, P., Peters, M. and Sharman, G., 2001. The effectiveness of information systems in supporting the extended supply chain. Journal of Business Logistics, 22(1), 1-27). This need for enterprise efficiency is compelling companies to review, to identify, and to adopt supply chain initiatives. This research investigates the use of common measurement metrics in an attempt to determine which one(s) are most useful for measuring performance as companies implement SCM practices. For firms that were engaged in SCM we found inventory and cycle time to be the most significant metrics.									10	0	0	0	2	12			0020-7543			WOS:000264481300011

The dynamic model is developed based on the geometric model of extensible continuum robot manipulators with no torsional effects. The development presented in this paper extends the previously available models to include a class of extensible continuum robot manipulators. First, the kinetic energy of a slice of the continuum robot is evaluated. Next, the total kinetic energy of the manipulator is obtained by utilizing a limit operation (i.e., sum of the kinetic energy of all the slices). Then, the gravitational potential energy of the manipulator is derived. Next, the elastic potential energy of the manipulator is derived for both bending and extension. Finally, the dynamic model of a planar 3-section extensible continuum robot manipulator is derived by utilizing the Lagrange representation. Numerical simulation results are presented for a planar 3-section extensible continuum robot manipulator.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0826-8185	1925-7090		WOS:000273906300008		
J	Wang, Kuang-Ching; Jacob, Jobin; Tang, Lei; Huang, Yong								Transmission error analysis and avoidance for IEEE 802.15.4 wireless sensors on rotating structures								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SENSOR NETWORKS				6	3-4	SI		224	233					2009	2009	Wireless sensors are increasingly adopted in manufacturing and vehicular systems for monitoring critical components under continuous operation. Many such components move rapidly and frequently in metallic containments with challenging radio propagation characteristics. For wireless sensors mounted on rotating structures, previous experimental studies observed an eminent increase in packet transmission errors at higher rotation speeds. Such errors were found to occur at specific locations around the rotating spindle's periphery and such locations depended sensitively on sensor location and surrounding geometry. This paper analyses the expected packet error rates with different rotation speeds and error region distributions, and proposes a transmission error avoidance approach based on online error pattern inference and transmission time control for IEEE 802.15.4 compatible sensor radios. Simulation studies showed a 50% error reduction and up to 75% throughput increase; higher throughput gains are expected for applications with more frequent and larger size data transmissions.					1st International Workshop on Sensor Networks1st International Workshop on Sensor Networks	AUG, 2008AUG, 2008		St Thomas, VISt Thomas, VI	6	0	0	0	0	6			1748-1279			WOS:000280104500009

Fuel characterization in the southern Appalachian Mountains: an application of landscape ecosystem classification								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE				18	4			423	429		10.1071/WF08017			2009	2009	Prescribed fire has been widely used in the south-eastern United States to meet forest management objectives, but has only recently been reintroduced to the southern Appalachian Mountains. Fuel information is not available to forest managers in this region and direct measurement is often impractical owing to steep, remote topography. The objective of the present study was to determine whether landscape ecosystem classification (LEC) site units support different types and amounts of fuel in the Chauga Ridges, a subregion of the Blue Ridge Mountain Province. Ecosystem classification identifies vegetation assemblages that are the expressive result of soils, physiography and vegetation, and recur predictably on the landscape. Four fuel complexes were identified using LEC units and field measurements of fuel characteristics. Fuel bed depth, duff (Oe + Oa) thickness, 1000-h fuel loading, and Rhododendron maximum, R. minus, and Vaccinium spp. ground cover were discriminating fuel characteristics of xeric, intermediate, submesic, and mesic site units. Discriminant function analysis provided an overall 64% cross-validation success rate using 138 undisturbed, randomly located plots. This method of characterizing fuel complexes may also be possible in other forested ecosystems where LECs or other ecological vegetation classifications have been developed.									3	0	0	3	0	3			1049-8001			WOS:000267465600006

However, most research has focused on species loss at one trophic-level. We explored the relationship between functional diversity (FD) and species richness separately for trees and aquatic leaf-shredding detritivores. For trees, we collected information on species-specific leaf tissue chemistry and species co-occurrences in the mid-Atlantic region (USA). For shredders, we used a published trait database with information on communities from 38 streams in the same region. We used a clustering algorithm to estimate FD for each community and for randomly assembled communities. If FD was high, we concluded that species loss was important to change in function; if low, species were functionally redundant and insensitive to species loss. We found tree FD to be significantly different than expected, but shredders exhibited FD levels similar to patterns based on random assembly. Furthermore, there were more leaf species exclusively associated with very high or very low levels of functional diversity compared to shredders. This approach revealed greater implications for leaf than shredder species loss for litter breakdown.					5th Plant Litter Processing in Freshwaters Conference5th Plant Litter Processing in Freshwaters Conference	JUN, 2008JUN, 2008		Coimbra, PORTUGALCoimbra, PORTUGAL	6	0	0	4	0	6			1434-2944			WOS:000269832100009

Phase-contrast and scanning electron microscopy revealed a wealth of new characters in the esophageal armature of the foregut. Larval gut morphology, particularly characters of the esophageal armature, varied significantly among taxa, permitting generic diagnoses. A cladogram inferred from 13 gut characters supported a sister-group relationship between Parasimulium and the remaining simuliids, but did not show a strong phylogenetic signal for the current, well-supported concept of tribal level monophyly.									1	0	0	2	0	2			1077-8306			WOS:000266490400007

GraphPad works with Tablet PCs or PCs with attached WACOM tablets. We describe how GraphPad enables an instructor to: establish a temporary network with the instructor's Tablet as server and the students' Tablets as clients, broadcast instructions and collect student Ink responses, evaluate student submissions and distribute evaluations with a single button-click, use student submissions as examples to guide lecture, and save student submissions in a database. The saved submissions may be replayed and reviewed individually, tagged for errors, and analyzed statistically. We are currently using GraphPad almost daily in a data structures course. A long term goal is to analyze data collected by GraphPad to help understand the thought process of computer science students for the purpose of identifying students at risk early in order to provide intervention assistance.

J	Atluri, Mahesh; Chowdhury, Mashrur; Kanhere, Neeraj; Fries, Ryan; Sarasua, Wayne; Ogle, Jennifer								Development of a Sensor System for Traffic Data Collection								JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION				43	1			1	20					2009	2009	Although many types of traffic sensors are currently in use, all have some drawbacks, and widespread deployment of such sensor systems has been difficult due to high costs. Due to these deficiencies, there is a need to design and evaluate a low cost sensor system that measures both vehicle speed and counts. Fulfilling this need is the primary objective of this research. Compared to the many existing infrared-based concepts that have been developed for traffic data collection, the proposed method uses a transmission-based type of optical sensor rather than a reflection-based type. Vehicles passing between sensors block transmission of the infrared signal, thus indicating the presence of a vehicle. Vehicle speeds are then determined using the known distance between multiple pairs of sensors. A prototype of the sensor system, which uses laser diode and photo detector pairs with the laser directly projected onto the photo detector, was first developed and tested in the laboratory. Subsequently this experimental prototype was implemented for field testing. The traffic flow data collected were compared to manually collected vehicle speed and traffic counts and a statistical analysis was done to evaluate the accuracy of the sensor system. The analysis found no significant difference between the data generated by the sensor system and the data collected manually at a 95% confidence interval. However, the testing scenarios were limited and so further analysis is necessary to determine the applicability in more congested urban areas. The proposed sensor system, with its simple technology and low cost, will be suitable for saturated deployment to form a densely distributed sensor network and can provide unique support for efficient traffic incident management. Additionally, because it may be quickly installed in the field without the need of elaborate fixtures, it may be deployed for use in temporary traffic management applications such as traffic management in road work zones or during special events.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0197-6729			WOS:000261217300001

The flow rate was optimized at 0.7 mL min(-1) and the separation accomplished in less than 8 minutes. Baseline resolution was achieved in an elution window of about 4 minutes. The ion-exchange separation was performed on an anion-exchange column using a gradient mobile phase composition of 0.5 mM nitric acid containing 2% methanol and 50 mM nitric acid. The separation was accomplished in less than 8 minutes at a flow rate of 0.9 mL min(-1). The eluted species were detected and identified using a PB-EIMS system providing species-specific information. The influence of various instrument parameters was evaluated to achieve optimal mass spectrometric response for the test compounds. The absolute detection limits of arsenic species with HPLC/PB-EIMS were 0.03, 0.05, 0.008 ng and 0.005 (5 mL injection) in the SIM mode and 0.1, 0.14, 0.04 and 0.01 ng in the TIC mode for As (III), DMA, AB and As 328 respectively. These investigations revealed that the majority (90-95%) of the arsenic present in the ethanolic extract samples is in the form of inorganic arsenic, with minor amounts of As (5-10% of the total As) present in the form of DMA. There were no detectable levels of AB and arsenosugars. The total arsenic content in the ethanolic extracts was verified by ICP-OES and validated by analyzing NIST SRM 3241 Ephedra sinica Stapf Native Extract and SRM 3243 Ephedra-Containing Solid Oral Dosage Form. These investigations indicate that PB-EIMS is a viable approach for comprehensive speciation of various botanical extracts.									10	0	0	8	0	10			0267-9477			WOS:000262850100006

ASAS Centennial Paper: Future needs of research and extension in forage utilization								JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE				87	1			438	446		10.2527/jas.2008-1273			JAN 2009	2009	Forage-animal production agriculture is implementing infrastructure changes and management strategies to adjust to increased energy-related costs of fuel, feed grains, fertilizers, and seeds. The primary objectives of this position paper are to assess future research and extension scientific needs in forage utilization, financial support for the discipline, and changing status and number of scientists. A survey questionnaire returned from 25 land-grant universities in the eastern half of the United States rated the top 4 research needs as 1) pasture systems and efficiency of production; 2) interfacing with energy concerns; 3) forage cultivar evaluations and persistence; and 4) environment impacts. Plant-animal future research needs at 11 USDA-ARS regional locations are targeted at sustainable management and improved livestock performance, ecophysiology and ecology of grasslands, environment impacts, and improved technologies for nutritive value assessments. Extension scientists from 17 southern and northeastern states listed the top 3 needs as forage persistence, soil fertility and nutrient management, and pasture systems and efficiency of production. Grant funds currently provide more than 40% of land-grant university research and extension efforts in forage utilization, and scientists estimate that this support base will increase to 55 to 60% of the funding total by 2013. Reduced allocation of state and federal funding has contributed to a reduction in the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) scientists engaged in forage utilization research and extension activities. The current 25 state FTE conducting research number about 2.8 per state. This includes 10 states with > 3, 11 states with < 2, and 3 states with < 1 FTE. Increased interest in cellulosic energy, climate change, and environmental impact may offer new opportunities for these FTE to participate in integrated cross-discipline research Extension programming, and technology transfer methods will change to accommodate reduced funding but with increasing numbers of novice, recreation-oriented landowners.									4	0	0	3	0	4			0021-8812			WOS:000262389200045	18820155

The idea originates from utilizing the unique configuration and the embedded piezoelectricity of active probes for high amplitude vibration, the attribute that is essential for precise measurement of ultrasmall mass by cantilever-based vibratory sensors. In this work, using focused ion beam technique, a small mass in the order of picograms is added at the tip of active probes. To detect the added mass, a precise model for modal characterization of the probe with geometrical discontinuities is utilized along with a parameter estimation technique for system identification. Using the shifts in the resonant frequencies of the identified system, the amount of added tip mass is estimated at the most sensitive mode of operation. Through a sensitivity analysis, it is shown that the second mode of the present configuration of the active probe is the most reliable mode for mass detection. Moreover, the effect of parameters' uncertainties on the sensitivity of measurements is studied in more detail. Results indicate that system identification procedure proposed in this work is an inevitable step toward achieving precise measurement of ultrasmall masses through active probes with great potential in bio- and chemomass detection applications.

The dielectric constant of a regular set of SWNTs deposited on a plane is compared to that of a single MWNT having the same size when the same pressure of ammonia molecules is applied on them. The corresponding resonance frequency shifts in the two sensors display an enhanced sensitivity of SWNT over the MWNT in excellent agreement with the experimental measurements.

J	Kutty, Jaishankar K.; Webb, Ken								Mechanomimetic Hydrogels for Vocal Fold Lamina Propria Regeneration								JOURNAL OF BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE-POLYMER EDITION				20	5-6			737	756		10.1163/156856209X426763			2009	2009	Vocal fold injury commonly leads to reduced vocal quality due to scarring-induced alterations in matrix composition and tissue biomechanics. The long-term hypothesis motivating our work is that rapid restoration of phonation and the associated dynamic mechanical environment will reduce scarring and promote regenerative healing. Toward this end, the objective of this study was to develop mechanomimetic, degradable hydrogels approximating the viscoelastic properties of the vocal ligament and mucosa that may be photopolymerized in situ to restore structural integrity to vocal fold tissues. The tensile and rheological properties of hydrogels (targeting the vocal ligament and mucosa, respectively) were varied as a function of macromer concentration. PEG diacrylate-based hydrogels exhibited linear stress-strain response and elastic modulus consistent with the properties of the vocal ligament at low strains (0-15%), but did not replicate the non-linear behavior observed in native tissue at higher strains. Methacrylated hyaluronic acid hydrogels displayed dynamic viscosity consistent with native vocal mucosa, while elastic shear moduli values were several-fold higher. Cell culture studies indicated that both hydrogels supported spreading, proliferation and collagen/proteoglycan matrix deposition by encapsulated fibroblasts throughout the 3D network.

One of the most important aspects is the interaction between cells and the microtopography of the implant surface. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of D1 cells, multipotent mouse bone marrow stromal precursors, in differentiating to adipocytes and to characterize their metabolic activity (lactic acid released and glucose consumed), leptin secretion and lipid production when cultured on patterned poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) films. It was determined that, by appropriate stimulation, the D1 cells displayed morphological characteristics of adipocytes and produced lipid. The results showed that a patterned surface did affect the rate of lipid production. Polynomial models were proposed to predict the amount of leptin secreted by the cells over a period of time.

Skeels) Peel								JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICINE AND BIOTECHNOLOGY										612805	10.1155/2009/612805			2009	2009	Antioxidant activities of wampee peel extracts using five different solvents (ethanol, hexane, ethyl acetate, butanol and water) were determined by using in-vitro antioxidant models including total antioxidant capability, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity, reducing power, and superoxide scavenging activity. Ethyl acetate fraction (EAF) exhibited the highest antioxidant activity compared to other fractions, even higher than synthetic antioxidant butylated hydroxyl toluene (BHT). In addition, the EAF exhibited strong anticancer activities against human gastric carcinoma (SGC-7901), human hepatocellular liver carcinoma (HepG-2) and human lung adenocarcinoma (A-549) cancer cell lines, higher than cisplatin, a conventional anticancer drug. The total phenolic content of wampee fraction was positively correlated with the antioxidant activity. This is the first report on the antioxidant and anticancer activities of the wampee peel extract. Thus, wampee peel can be used potentially as a readily accessible source of natural antioxidants and a possible pharmaceutical supplement. Copyright (C) 2009 K.

J	Ward, Mark, Sr.								Squaring the Learning Circle Cross-Classroom Collaborations and the Impact of Audience on Student Outcomes in Professional Writing								JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION				23	1			61	82		10.1177/1050651908324381			JAN 2009	2009	Student compositions traditionally are written for the teacher. Yet instructors of professional communication genres have discovered that students' motivation may be enhanced when they write assignments for audiences of peers within the classroom or professionals outside the campus. Yet client-based projects require writing students who have never yet written for an external audience to make a leap beyond the classroom. To bridge the gap between writing for classroom peers and writing for professional clients, this article describes a third and intermediate choice of audience, namely, external peers in cross-classroom collaborations that occur via telecommunication. The author places this intermediate-audience strategy within the larger conversation about the impact of audience on student writing outcomes, applies the strategy to professional writing pedagogy, and reports the results of a small pilot study that provide some preliminary support for the strategy.									5	0	0	0	1	5			1050-6519			WOS:000261095300003

N-(diethylcarbamothioyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide, HL1, C12H22N2OS, crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group P212121, with Z = 4, and unit cell parameters, a = 6.6925(13) , b = 9.0457(18) , c = 22.728(5) . The conformation of the HL1 molecule with respect to the thiocarbonyl and carbonyl moieties is twisted, as reflected by the torsion angles O1-C6-N2-C5, C6-N2-C5-N1 and S1-C5-N2-C6 of 1.68, -67.47 and 115.50, respectively. The structure of HL1 also shows a delocalization of the electrons of the thiocarbonyl group over the C-N bonds. The ring puckering analysis shows that the cyclohexane ring has a chair conformation. The bis(N-(morpholine-4-carbonothioyl)cyclohexane carboxamido)nickel(II) complex, Ni(L5)2, C24H38N4NiO4S2, crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/c, with Z = 4, and unit cell parameters, a = 16.919(3) , b = 8.3659(17) , c = 19.654(4) , = 107.43(3).

The palladium in the mononuclear complex is four-coordinate in a square-planar configuration with two carbenes of two benzo[d]imidazole rings and two halides. The two halides are disordered between Br and Cl, with the Cl: Br ratio approximately 0.7 : 0.3. The angles C1-Pd1-Br1, 88.63(11)degrees and C1i-Pd1-Br1i, 91.37(11)degrees (i: 1-x, 1-y, 1-z) in the coordination sphere are very close to the ideal value of 90 degrees. The Pd-X distance is slightly longer than other carbene derivative Pd-Cl single bond distances and slightly shorter than Pd-Br single bond distances. These results agree with the Cl/Br disorder at the halogen position. The palladium-carbene complex was tested as a catalyst in the direct arylation reaction of benzoxazoles and benzothiazoles with aryl bromides.									15	0	0	2	0	15			0095-8972	1029-0389		WOS:000268032900002

A quasi-experimental design with a matched control group assessed GSF model effects on client perceptions of serviced quality and satisfaction. Survey data from 1181 users and potential users were collected at baseline, six months and 12 months after implementation of the franchise network. Regression analyses controlled for baseline differences between intervention and control groups. Commune health station franchise membership was significantly associated with improvement of community perceptions of service quality and client satisfaction as well as their likeliness to return and recommend low-cost, community-based RHFP services to others. This study provides preliminary evidence regarding the ability of the GSF model to increase client satisfaction with RHFP services in primary public healthcare clinics.									6	0	0	2	0	6			1943-9342			WOS:000208053600002

Controlling Liquid Release by Compressing Electrospun Nanowebs								JOURNAL OF ENGINEERED FIBERS AND FABRICS				4	3			14	23					2009	2009	Electrospun nanowebs with pores ranging from nanometers to micrometers, constitute new materials with enhanced absorbency and ability to retain liquids in pores for a long period of time. These materials can be used as nanofluidic probes collecting minute amount of liquids. However, extraction of liquids from nanofibrous materials presents a problem: menisci in the interfiber pores create very high suction pressure which holds the liquid inside the material. This problem can be resolved if the probe is completely filled with the liquid: menisci at the probe edges become flat to establish a pressure equilibrium with the atmosphere. Therefore, one can take advantage of the nanoweb softness and extract liquid by mechanically deforming the nanowebs. We show that the liquid-saturated nanowebs follow the Voigt-type rheology upon loading. We theoretically explain this behavior and derive the relations between the Voigt phenomenological parameters, nanoweb permeability and compression modulus. We show that the limiting deformations follow the Hooke's law which assumes linear relation between the extracted volume of liquid and the applied load. Because of this predictable behavior, the nanoweb probes can be engineered to release minute liquid doses upon compression. The developed experimental methodology can be used for characterization of nanostructured materials which otherwise impossible to analyze by using the existing instruments.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1558-9250			WOS:000271568700002

Simulation of Multifilament Semicrystalline Polymer Fiber Melt-Spinning								JOURNAL OF ENGINEERED FIBERS AND FABRICS				4	1			34	43					2009	2009	The goal of this effort is to provide an accurate simulation of multifilament fiber melt spinning, applicable for a wide range of material and process conditions. For ease of use, the model should run on a standard laptop or desktop computer in reasonable time (one hour or less). Most melt spinning models simulate the formation of a single filament, with little or no attention given to multifilament effects. Available multifilament simulations are primarily limited to Newtonian constitutive models for the polymer flow. We present a multifilament simulation based on the flow-enhanced crystallization approach of Shrikhande et al. [J. Appl. Polym. Sci., 100, 2006, 3240-3254] combined with a variant on the multifilament quench model of Zhang, et al. [J. Macromol. Sci. Phys., 47, 2007, 793-806]. We demonstrate the versatility of this model by applying it to isotactic polypropylene and polyethylene terephthalate, under a variety of process conditions.									2	1	0	0	0	2			1558-9250			WOS:000266198300006

The taxonomy includes top-level attributes of team composition, communication, distribution, design approach, information, and nature of the problem. Three taxonomic-oriented measures are introduced and used to evaluate the taxonomy: orthogonality, completeness, and usability. This taxonomy is an initial step towards the creation of new agent-based collaborative support tools structured upon a fundamental understanding of the collaborative process with a theoretical foundation. More significantly, the taxonomy provides a valuable way of organising the research literature in collaborative design that is at present dispersed across many domains and disciplines.									14	0	0	0	0	14			0954-4828	1466-1837		WOS:000263201000003

Black Tea and Lignin as Ultraviolet Protectants for the Beet Armyworm Nucleopolyhedrovirus								JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGICAL SCIENCE				44	1			50	58					JAN 2009	2009	A major constraint to the use of baculoviruses for biocontrol of insects is their sensitivity to UV degradation. In this study. we evaluated black tea (Lipton (R). London, UK) and lignin (Reax 85A (TM). MeadWestvaco. Charleston, SC) as potential UV protectants for beet armyworm Spodoptera exigua (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) multiple-embedded nucleopolyhedrovirus (SeMNPV). The original activity remaining (OAR%) from SeMNPV upon exposure to various lengths of time (up to 5 h) to a source of UVA and UVB was evaluated in bioassays using beet armyworm third-stage larvae under laboratory conditions. Beet armyworm mortality was measured after larvae fed on artificial diet treated with SeMNPV. Mortality of beet armyworm due to SeMNPV, with no UV ptotectants Lidded, was reduced to 23, 11.3 and 2.1% upon UV exposure for 15, 30 or 60 min, respectively. To investigate the mechanism of reduction in the efficacy of SeMNPV when exposed to UV was clue to the degradation of full-length viral genomic DNA. a modified DNA isolalion technique was developed to measure levels of the full length viral genomic DNA of SeMNPV through electrophoresis on an agarose gel. The efficacy of SeMNPV on beet annyworm was lost after 2 h of UV exposure. and the full-length genomic DNA also was degraded to levels that were riot visible on agarose gel. However, both black tea and lignin provided nearly 100%. UV protection for SeMNPV as measured in bioassays even after 5 h of UV irradiation. SeMNPV efficacy against beet armyworm in samples containing black tea or lignin resulted in no significant Visual reduction of the full length viral genomic DNA. To investigate the mechanism of UV protection for SeMNPV from black tea and lignin. absorption spectra of both protectants were measured with a spectrophotometer. High rate of absorption in the UV range, especially at the range of UVB (280-320nm). was detected for both materials. The absorption rate was higher with lignin than with black tea. Whereas lignin was a good absorber for both UVB and UVA radiation, black tea was primarily art absorber of UVB. Therefore. both black tea and lignin are potential natural UV protectants in the formulation of baculovirus-based biopesticides.									6	0	0	4	0	7			0749-8004			WOS:000264951200006

The four field waves of the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study (CILS) are described and the main theoretical models emerging from it are presented and graphically summarised. After considering critical views of this theory, we present the most recent results from this longitudinal research programme in the form of quantitative models predicting downward assimilation in early adulthood and qualitative interviews identifying ways for the disadvantaged children of immigrants to escape it. Quantitative results strongly support the predicted effects of exogenous variables identified by segmented assimilation theory and identify the intervening factors during adolescence that mediate their influence on adult outcomes. Qualitative evidence gathered during the last stage of the study points to three factors that can lead to exceptional educational achievement among disadvantaged youths, and which indicate the positive influence of selective acculturation. Finally, the implications of these findings for theory and policy are discussed.									79	0	0	0	1	80			1369-183X	1469-9451		WOS:000271652500002	23626483

Function of Arabidopsis hexokinase-like1 as a negative regulator of plant growth								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY				60	14			4137	4149		10.1093/jxb/erp252			2009	2009	A recent analysis of the hexokinase (HXK) gene family from Arabidopsis revealed that three hexokinase-like (HKL) proteins lack catalytic activity, but share about 50% identity with the primary glucose (glc) sensor/transducer protein AtHXK1. Since the AtHKL1 protein is predicted to bind glc, although with a relatively decreased affinity, a reverse genetics approach was used to test whether HKL1 might have a related regulatory function in plant growth. By comparing phenotypes of an HKL1 mutant (hkl1-1), an HXK1 mutant (gin2-1), and transgenic lines that overexpress HKL1 in either wild-type or gin2-1 genetic backgrounds, it is shown that HKL1 is a negative effector of plant growth. Interestingly, phenotypes of HKL1 overexpression lines are generally very similar to those of gin2-1. These are quantified, in part, as reduced seedling sensitivity to high glc concentrations and reduced seedling sensitivity to auxin-induced lateral root formation. However, commonly recognized targets of glc signalling are not apparently altered in any of the HKL1 mutant or transgenic lines. In fact, most, but not all, of the observed phenotypes associated with HKL1 overexpression occur independently of the presence of HXK1 protein. The data indicate that HKL1 mediates cross-talk between glc and other plant hormone response pathways. It is also considered Whether a possibly decreased glc binding affinity of HKL1 could possibly be a feedback mechanism to limit plant growth in the presence of excessive carbohydrate availability is further considered.									15	4	0	15	0	18			0022-0957			WOS:000270906800015	19706780

One hundred forty-three participants completed the Family Environment Scale (FES-R: Moos & Moos, 1986), the Attitudes Toward Lesbians and Gay Men scale (ATLG: Herek, 1994), and demographic questions. Results suggest that three family dimensions (conflict, intellectual-cultural orientation, and moral-religious emphasis) significantly predicted attitudes toward lesbians and gay men. The results also revealed that younger students held more negative attitudes toward lesbians and gay men than their older peers. Implications for educators, researchers, and practitioners are discussed.									5	0	0	2	0	5			0091-8369			WOS:000270453900006	19802762

Investigation of circular jets in shallow water								JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC RESEARCH				47	5			611	618		10.3826/jhr.2009.3474			2009	2009	The combined influence of the free surface and the bed on the flow characteristics of circular turbulent jets issued at mid-plane into shallow, stagnant ambient fluid is investigated using a physical model study. A total of nine experiments have been performed under different Reynolds numbers and submergence ratios. The velocity profiles in the horizontal plane are found to be similar, while the velocity profiles in the vertical plane are similar only in the near zone. The growth rate of velocity profiles in the horizontal plane consists of two distinct regions for low submergences, namely regions 1 and 2, corresponding to a mild and steep growth rates, respectively. The growth rate in the vertical plane within the near zone is linear. The local maximum velocity decay rate follows the free circular jet in the near zone and wall or surface jet in the far zone.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0022-1686			WOS:000272261700007		
J	Ma, Yongchang; Zhou, Yan; Chowdhury, Mashrur; Wang, Kuang-Ching; Fries, Ryan N.								A Framework for Performance Evaluation of Communication Alternatives for Intelligent Transportation Systems								JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS				13	3			111	126	PII 913826073	10.1080/15472450903084212			2009	2009	The communications infrastructure is critical for effective and efficient operation of intelligent transportation system (ITS) functions. Relatively large investments from the public sector are usually required to construct and maintain or provide leasing fee to private telecommunication companies for such infrastructure. Consequently, a rigorous analysis and evaluation of communication alternatives is of utmost importance. This research sought to develop a systematic framework and associated platform that will facilitate the evaluation of the communication alternatives for ITS. The framework includes identifying alternative architectures, such as distributed, centralized, or a combination of both, and identifying communication mediums including wired, wireless, or a combination of both. This article presents, as a part of the framework, important measures of effectiveness (MOE) for making objective comparisons between alternatives based on the performance of the communication systems related to ITS. A simulation platform that integrated a traffic and communication simulator was used for efficiently evaluating communication alternatives with different architecture and mediums by generating important MOEs. A case study was performed for a test network in Greenville, South Carolina. The proposed evaluation framework identified four communication alternatives, namely, the centralized wired, distributed wired, centralized wireless, and distributed wireless, to generate the selected MOEs, such as throughput, delivery ratio, and throughput cost ratios, for comparing and analyzing these alternatives.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1547-2450	1547-2442		WOS:000268833000001		
J	Hammitt, William E.; Kyle, Gerard T.; Oh, Chi-Ok								Comparison of Place Bonding Models in Recreation Resource Management								JOURNAL OF LEISURE RESEARCH				41	1			57	72					2009	2009	Conceptual studies of place bonding have often stopped short of verifying the relationship of scales/models to other relevant recreation behavior variables. The current paper addresses this concern by comparing three models (full, parsimonious, and partial models) of place bonding and their scale measurement to a dependent variable, experience use history (EUH), for degree of predictive validity. Results reveal that the full and parsimonious place bonding models predicted more EUH variance than the partial model. Because the parsimonious model's fit and psychometric properties were as good as the full model, the parsimonious model is recommended over the other models. The parsimonious scale provides researchers with a robust and nuanced measure of people's attachment to place.									27	0	0	0	0	27			0022-2216			WOS:000263308500004

They report no difference in perceived security of the ratings, utility of the ratings, or satisfaction with the PA. Online employees report significantly lower levels of quality for the PA ratings than traditional employees.Research limitations/implications - The paper is limited to employees in one organization and the variables examined. In the future, researchers should examine super-visor and human resource (FIR) manager reactions to the system, additional individual difference variables, variables related to technology acceptance and use, and additional PA reactions.Practical implications - The findings inform HR managers about how one sample of employees' reacted to an online appraisal. It is important for organizations to ensure all system users are well-trained in how to provide quality ratings and feedback through the system.Originality/value - This is the first quasi-experiment comparing employees' attitudes toward an online administration of PA to a traditional P&P administration.					23rd Annual Meeting of the Society-for-Industrial-and-Organizational-Psychology23rd Annual Meeting of the Society-for-Industrial-and-Organizational-Psychology	APR 10-12, 2008APR 10-12, 2008	Soc Ind & Org PsycholSoc Ind & Org Psychol	San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA	19	0	0	0	1	19			0268-3946			WOS:000269626100004

This paper presents the results and analysis from a research study conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of fly ash and ground granulated blast furnace slag (slag) in mitigating expansions induced by ASR in the presence of a potassium acetate based deicer. Standard and modified ASTM C 1260 and 1567 tests were conducted on mortar specimens prepared with five aggregates to study the mitigation behavior of fly ashes and slag. In this study, fly ash was evaluated at 15, 25, and 35%, and slag at 40 and 50% by mass replacement of cement. Changes in length, dynamic elastic modulus, and microstructure of the mortar bars were studied. Results from these studies indicate that low- and intermediate-lime fly ashes were more effective than high-lime fly ash at 25 and 35% cement replacement levels. High-lime fly ash was ineffective even at a replacement level of 35%. Slag at 50% cement replacement was more effective in mitigating expansions compared to 40% dosage level.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0899-1561			WOS:000263111900003

Miniature Spinning Enzyme-Retted Flax Fibers								JOURNAL OF NATURAL FIBERS				6	1			1	13		10.1080/15440470802700238			2009	2009	Flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) fibers can be blended with other short staple fibers, such as cotton (Gossypium barbadense L. or Gossypium hirsutum L.), processed into a yarn, and then manufactured into a fabric. Enzyme-retting is a new, experimental method that decomposes the pectinaceous and matrix substances to separate cellulose fibers from shives using pectinase-rich enzymes and chelators. Spinning tests were used to determine how well fibers were assembled to form yarn and provided an indirect measurement of fiber properties. Miniature spinning allows expanded predictive strategies for ranking fiber production methods such as enzyme-retting and resultant yarns beyond traditional fiber testing.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1544-0478			WOS:000282846900001

We have developed a set of laboratory exercises, assignments, and exam questions utilizing the state/representative soil that gives college students an opportunity to practice interpretation of soil series descriptions, taxonomic classes, soil forming factors, and soil physical and chemical properties. Sixty-seven Clemson University students from various fields (horticulture, forestry, agricultural mechanization, agricultural education, wildlife biology, and environmental science) had a hands-on experience with the State/Representative Soil Project during the CSENV 202: Soils course taught in the spring of 2006. Student responses to the laboratory exercises were strongly positive, both in terms of how the State/Representative Soil Project helped them understand a range of soil science topics as well as their practical applications. Incorporation of the State/Representative Soil Project into agricultural science education should have a significant impact on the quality of soil science education and training.									1	0	0	3	0	3			1059-9053			BCI:BCI201000105361

Journal of orthopaedic surgery and research				4				12	12		10.1186/1749-799X-4-12			2009 Apr 20	2009	Heterotopic ossification (HO) is defined as the process by which trabecular bone forms outside of the skeletal structure, occupying space in soft tissue where it does not normally exist. The current popular prophylactic treatment modalities include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and radiation therapy, although the literature remains inconclusive as to which is superior. Additionally, both treatments can lead to adverse effects to the patient. Recently there have been several studies attempting to identify new aspects of the etiology of heterotopic bone formation and introduce new prophylactic modalities with increased efficacy and fewer side effects. For this review, we selectively retrieved articles from Medline published from 1958-2008 on the prophylaxis of HO with the aim of assisting readers in quickly grasping the current status of research and clinical aspects of HO prophylaxis.									50	0	0	23	0	51				1749-799X		MEDLINE:19379483	19379483

No. GP-902, PI 653111) is a noncommercial breeding line of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) jointly released by the USDA-ARS, the Clemson University Experiment Station, and Cotton Incorporated in 2007. PD 99035 was selected from a cross of PD 93043 and 'DPL 5409'. PD 99035 possesses outstanding fiber-quality properties, significantly better than several commercial cultivars. Specifically, PD 99035 possesses outstanding fiber strength and length potential, while also maintaining micronaire values lower than commercial cultivars. PD 99035 possesses mid- to late maturity and produces lint yield similar to or just below commercial cultivars. PD 99035 is best adapted within the southeastern United States, although our data also suggest it has broad adaptation across the U.S. Upland cotton production region. The combination of longer fiber length, stronger fiber strength, lower micronaire, and acceptable lint yield potential makes PD 99035 a valuable genetic resource to cotton breeding programs.									3	0	0	3	0	3			1936-5209			WOS:000268932700015

Chicks were reared in battery cages and fed a practical diet with vitamin A (control) or the same diet without supplemental vitamin A from day-old to 23 or 30 days of age. The treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with 6-8 replications. At termination body weight, feed intake, and tissue weights were recorded and tissues analysed for ascorbic acid, GULO activity, antioxidant activty, and oxidant status. Growth, feed intake, relative weights of bursa of Fabricius, liver, spleen and testis were significantly reduced in vitamin A-deficient chicks. Vitamin A deficiency depressed renal GULO activity by 20016 (P<0.08) and 33% (P<0.007) in Experiment I and 2 respectively. Bursal, hepatic, splenic, testicular, and plasma ascorbic acid concentrations, plasma total antioxidant activity, and plasma oxidant status were not altered by the decrease in GULO activity. However, plasma advanced oxidation protein products were lower (P<0.02) in vitamin A-deficient chickens. The lack of effect on tissue ascorbic acid and antioxidant capacity suggest that metabolic changes associated with vitamin A deficiency may reduce ascorbic acid excretion. The reduction in plasma advanced oxidation protein products may be ascribed to lower metabolic activity because of hypothyroidism in vitamin A-deficient chicks. In conclusion, short-term vitamin A deficiency in broiler chicks reduced GULO activity without concomittant changes in tissue ascorbic acid.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1346-7395			WOS:000262795700003

Measurements were performed in two rounds by twelve laboratories involved in active thermoelectric research using a number of different commercial and custom-built measurement systems and techniques. In this paper we report the detailed statistical analyses on the interlaboratory measurement results and the statistical methodology for analysis of irregularly sampled measurement curves in the interlaboratory study setting. Based on these results, we have selected Bi2Te3 as the prototype standard material. Once available, this SRM will be useful for future interlaboratory data comparison and instrument calibrations.									11	0	0	0	0	11			1044-677X			WOS:000265284300004	27504212

To understand the flow and its effect on microstructure, this paper presents an integrated experimental and modeling approach for a synthetic discotic mesophase pitch (AR-HP). Careful control of shear rate and strain was exercised throughout the rheological studies. Wide-angle x-ray diffraction studies were conducted on carefully solidified rheological specimens to obtain azimuthal profiles for layer plane orientation. Cross-polarized microscopy was conducted in the reflected mode using a first-order red plate to examine the orientation in three orthogonal planes. Under the influence of steady shear, the microstructure of mesophase pitch became flow-aligned, which is similar to the fibrous structure reported in the literature. Transient stress response, however, displayed a nonmonotonic behavior. Microscopic observations indicate that the local maximum in the shear stress is likely caused by the deformation of the initial microstructure. To develop a better understanding of these complex flow dynamics, simulations based on the Landau-de Gennes nematodynamics adapted to discotic mesophases were performed, and a qualitative agreement between simulations and experiments was found. The experimentally obtained rheostructural results and the numerical simulations provide a systematic understanding of flow-microstructure relationships during transient and steady shear flow.									5	1	0	0	0	6			0148-6055			WOS:000262105000005

Hence, involvement does play a significant moderating role; in most cases the relationships are stronger for consumers with higher involvement.Research limitations/implications - Findings are generalizable only to the four industries investigated.Practical implications - Relative to customers with low levels of involvement, managers must be sure to motivate their employees to work with customers to help solve their problems and thus enhance the level of involvement. Conversely, for highly involved customers, contact employees must be aware that they may not play as significant a role in the overall purchase experience as the consumer feels they (the consumer) are an "expert" relative to the products offered. In such cases, customer-oriented employees' role is to be willing to play a supporting and less important role in a customer's purchase decision.Originality/value - While many studies have investigated service quality and satisfaction, the research represents the first effort to determine whether the relationship between these two variables differs based on a consumer characteristic; in this case, involvement.									21	0	0	0	3	23			0887-6045			WOS:000267712000005

Scaling analysis of a neocortex inspired cognitive model on the Cray XD1								JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING				47	1			21	43		10.1007/s11227-008-0195-z			JAN 2009	2009	This paper presents the implementation and scaling of a neocortex inspired cognitive model on a Cray XD1. Both software and reconfigurable logic based FPGA implementations of the model are examined. This model belongs to a new class of biologically inspired cognitive models. Large scale versions of these models have the potential for significantly stronger inference capabilities than current conventional computing systems. These models have large amounts of parallelism and simple computations, thus allowing highly efficient hardware implementations. As a result, hardware-acceleration of these models can produce significant speedups over fully software implementations. Parallel software and hardware-accelerated implementations of such a model are investigated for networks of varying complexity. A scaling analysis of these networks is presented and utilized to estimate the throughput of both hardware-accelerated and software implementations of larger networks that utilize the full resources of the Cray XD1. Our results indicate that hardware-acceleration can provide average throughput gains of 75 times over software-only implementations of the networks we examined on this system.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0920-8542			WOS:000261954400002

Journal of surgical orthopaedic advances				18	4			175	81					2009	2009	This study compared the biomechanical performance of 4.5-mm limited-contact dynamic compression plates (DCPs) and 3.5-mm locking compression plates (LCPs) for the fixation of unstable humeral shaft fractures. Composite humeri were divided into two groups: 3.5-mm LCPs and 4.5-mm DCPs. Osteotomy gaps of 5 mm, simulating diaphyseal comminution, were created. Stiffness tests were performed in anterior-posterior (AP) bending, medial-lateral (ML) bending, torsion, and axial compression. Results showed that while construct stiffnesses in ML bending and torsional loading are significantly higher for the 4.5 DCP group (p < .05), no statistically significant differences were observed in AP bending or axial compression. Fatigue characteristics under cyclic AP bending conditions were also evaluated, although no failures occurred. Data from the literature suggest that stiffness results for the LCP constructs perhaps afford sufficient fixation strength capable of supporting the physiologic loads most commonly applied during postoperative rehabilitation. However, results indicate that the DCP construct is mechanically advantageous for stabilizing diaphyseal comminuted fractures.									5	0	0	1	0	5			1548-825X			MEDLINE:19995496	19995496	
J	Grover, Varun; Gokhale, Rahul A.; Narayanswamy, Ravi S.								Resource-Based Framework for IS Research: Knowledge Firms and Sustainability in Knowledge Markets								JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS				10	4			306	332					2009	2009	The open and fragmented nature of IS research has spawned a vibrant debate about sustainability of the IS discipline. Intellectually stimulating and rooted in a rich repertoire of approaches, the debate is frequently polarized along a dialectical spectrum, where advocates take positions on appropriate boundaries and audiences for the discipline. With the objective of reframing this debate, and the hope of moving it forward, this paper develops a resource-based metaphorical model for IS research. We establish that disciplines can be viewed as analogous to contemporary firms, and thus, resource-based concepts for the sustainability of contemporary firms can be extended to examining the sustainability of knowledge firms. Our central proposition is that differences in "knowledge product" heterogeneity, when positioned appropriately with the market demand, can affect the sustainability of the IS firm. In resolving the issue of boundary conditions, our analysis suggests that the likelihood of IS outperforming other competing disciplines is feasible regardless of whether a distinct identity is forged. This relation is contingent on the ability of a knowledge firm to secure resources. Distinctness is required however, when a knowledge firm is unable to generate resources. Our analysis also indicates that the debate on audiences maybe misplaced. Beyond addressing the debate, however, we conclude that an inductive approach to research with a focus on addressing problems faced by emical markets is more likely to ensure sustainability when contrasted with other perspectives.									8	0	0	0	0	8			1536-9323			WOS:000267037900001		
J	Freeman, Yuri; Harrell, William R.; Luzinov, Igor; Holman, Brian; Lessner, Philip								Electrical Characterization of Tantalum Capacitors with Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) Counter Electrodes								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				156	6			G65	G70		10.1149/1.3116246			2009	2009	A combination of structural and electrical characterization techniques was applied to polymer Ta capacitors with in situ and prepolymerized poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) cathodes with a broad range of Ta(2)O(5) dielectric thicknesses. The in situ PEDOT was produced by polymerizing the EDOT monomer using an oxidizer/dopant. The prepolymerized material was an aqueous suspension of doped polymer which was dried to produce the PEDOT film. Experimental data show that polymer Ta capacitors with prepolymerized PEDOT have lower dc leakage and higher breakdown voltage (BDV) compared to polymer Ta capacitors with in situ PEDOT. The difference in dc leakage and BDV between these two types of capacitors becomes greater with increasing thickness and improved structure of the Ta(2)O(5) dielectric film. These experimental results are inconsistent with current theories presented in the literature. An alternative model is presented based on classical metal/insulator/semiconductor (MIS) theory, where in this case M corresponds to the Ta metal, I corresponds to the Ta(2)O(5) insulator, and S corresponds to the semiconducting PEDOT. According to this model, a potential barrier for the current carriers at the insulator/semiconductor interface controls the current flow through the Ta(2)O(5) dielectric under normal operating conditions (positive polarity on the Ta anode and a temperature range of -55 degrees C <= T <= 105 degrees C). In situ polymerization of the PEDOT adversely affects this barrier, while the prepolymerized PEDOT suspension leaves it essentially intact. The different migratory ability of the dopants in in situ and prepolymerized PEDOT also contributes to the differences in electrical performance of polymer Ta capacitors with in situ and prepolymerized PEDOT cathodes.									11	0	0	0	0	11			0013-4651			WOS:000265737600040

Since vacation lifestyle variables, which could be utilized as a base for marketing research, have not received much attention from market researchers, this article attempts to further purify the extant scale and use Taiwanese travelers as a case study. The study survey was conducted of 443 tourists staying at least one night at the Ken-Ting National Park in Taiwan from April to May, 2002. This study collected 420 useful samples. Three groups of users merged from the cluster analysis: (a) Family Oriented Travelers, (b) Social Oriented Travelers, and (c) Stylish Travelers. The study shows that the differences in trip characteristics are the frequencies of domestic travel, the frequencies of international travel, the hotel preferences, and the average expenditure on accommodations. The variations in demographic characteristics relate to age, family life cycle, education, and household income. This study on vacation lifestyle subsequently renders a new assessment tool to tourism professionals in Taiwan to grasp the lifestyle profile of their customers and develop strategies to entice the travel market.									8	0	0	0	0	8			1054-8408			WOS:000284827300004

Toward an Understanding of Racial and Ethnic Differences in Conservation Attitudes among Recreation Participants								LEISURE SCIENCES				31	1			53	67	PII 906931500	10.1080/01490400802558186			2009	2009	With significant demographic changes in the United States, an understanding of racial and ethnic differences in conservation support is essential for successful resource management and protection. The purpose of this paper was to construct the causal framework of fostering recreationists' conservation attitudes using recreation specialization and identify how the developmental process differs by race and ethnicity. Results indicated strong support for the proposed model that recreation specialization and other latent factors provided a good understanding of conservation support for both Hispanic and Anglo recreationists. Recreationists showed similar patterns of fostering conservation attitudes regardless of racial and ethnic origins.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0149-0400			WOS:000261803700004

Whether the self-classification measure can accurately classify respondents as casual, active, and committed divers was examined. A questionnaire was sent to 646 scuba divers recruited for the study, and a 78% response rate was obtained. The categories accurately predicted responses to a multiple indicator approach with a high level of replicability. These categories were used to estimate three stated preference models. Results for casual and active divers were as expected, but committed divers were the least favorable toward trip profiles with greater management restrictions. Alternative explanations worthy of future research are identified and discussed.									12	0	0	1	0	12			0149-0400			WOS:000263647000001

Extremely high flexibility of these materials poses a challenge: their pore structure easily changes upon contact with the fluid in question. This paper sets a physical basis for analyses of absorption processes in nanotubular and nanofibrous materials. As an example, we study absorption of droplets by yams and webs made of nanofibers and microfibers. We show that absorption can induce different types of deformations: visible deformations of the sample profile and deformations of the yarn diameter/length caused by the capillary forces. Using experimental data and theory, we estimate elastic and transport characteristics of the nanofibrous materials. The reported experiments and proposed theory open a new area of research on absorption-induced deformations of nanotubular and nanofibrous materials and show their potential applications as sensors to probe minute amount of absorbable liquids.

Like Berlekamp's algorithm for univariate polynomials, the new method is based on the invariant subspace of the Frobenius map acting on the quotient algebra. The dimension of the invariant subspace equals the number of primary components, and a basis of the invariant subspace yields a complete decomposition. Unlike previous approaches for decomposing multivariate polynomial systems, the new method does not need primality testing nor any generic projection, instead it reduces the general decomposition problem directly to root finding of univariate polynomials over the ground field. Also, it is shown how Grobner basis structure can be used to get partial primary decomposition without any root finding.									3	2	0	0	0	3			0025-5718	1088-6842		WOS:000260130200025		
J	Srivastava, Nilabh; Haque, Imtiaz								A review on belt and chain continuously variable transmissions (CVT): Dynamics and control								MECHANISM AND MACHINE THEORY				44	1			19	41		10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2008.06.007			JAN 2009	2009	Over the last two decades, significant research effort has been directed towards developing vehicle transmissions that reduce the energy consumption of an automobile. This effort has been a direct consequence of the growing environmental concern imposing the directives of reduced exhaust emissions and increased vehicle efficiency on current vehicle manufacturers and users. A continuously variable transmission (CVT) offers a continuum of gear ratios between desired limits, which consequently enhances the fuel economy and dynamic performance of a vehicle by better matching the engine operating conditions to the variable driving scenarios. Although a CVT plays a crucial role in the plan to improve vehicle fuel economy, its complete potential has not been realized in a mass-production vehicle. The current paper reviews the state-of-the-art research on dynamic modeling and control of friction-limited continuously variable transmissions. The basic concepts, mathematical models, and computational schemes are extensively discussed. Challenges and critical issues for future research on modeling and control of such CVTs are also discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We evaluated the immune status of eight dolphins with lobomycosis and 40 healthy dolphins from the Indian River Lagoon (IRL), Florida. Lobomycosis cases had multiple abnormalities in their immunologic parameters when compared to healthy dolphins. The absolute number of circulating lymphocytes and serum albumin concentration were reduced (P0.05) while the segmented neutrophils, alpha 1, total beta, total gamma and total globulins were increased (P0.05). Although innate immunity was relatively intact and phagocytosis and natural killer cell activity were not affected, the plasma lysozyme concentrations were elevated in dolphins with lobomycosis (P0.05). Adaptive immunity was depressed with statistically significant decreases found in the absolute numbers of CD4+ helper T cells and CD19+ and CD21+ B cells. The ratios of CD2+ T cells to CD4+ cells and CD2+ to CD21+ cells were increased (P=0.05 and P0.05, respectively) and the numbers of lymphocytes expressing MHC class II molecules was decreased in dolphins with lobomycosis (P0.05). Lymphocyte proliferation was reduced in response to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide and concanavalin A (P0.05). Antibody titers to Erysipelas rhusiopathiae, a common marine micro-organism, were decreased (P0.05). In summary, dolphins with lobomycosis exhibit significant impairment in adaptive immunity.									25	0	0	21	0	26			1369-3786			WOS:000262721300002	18608890

Thus, researchers hypothesize academic motivation to be a negative factor for educational aspirations when applied to an urban sample of African American middle school students (N = 198). The authors tested this hypothesis using a cross-sectional sample of sixth, seventh, and eighth graders. Logistic regression analyses failed to support. the hypothesis; however, the results highlighted the disproportionate ratio between African American females and males in desiring postsecondary education, which is consistent. with national data on academic achievement.

We design a new transmission scheduling protocol that takes advantage of the multiple-access capabilities of DSSS through two key features. First, the transmission schedule employs a more aggressive spatial reuse policy. Second, our protocol reduces overhead by accounting for fewer terminals in the scheduling because only the strongest interferers disrupt packet reception. Transmissions use both common and transmitter-oriented spreading codes to support reliable neighbor discovery and broadcast capability, respectively. Spreading factors may be adapted to increase throughput of unicast traffic on links with high SINR. Through simulations, we evaluate the performance of the transmission scheduling protocol in mobile and stationary scenarios.

The demodulator performance is sensitive to errors in these estimates, and the sensitivity increases as M increases. We examine the effects of phase and amplitude errors on the performance of QAM communication systems with error-control coding and soft-decision decoding.

The statistics from one packet are employed to select the code for the next packet. The design and evaluation of cross-layer protocols that use such statistics typically require numerous simulations of the network, and each simulation of the network has numerous embedded simulations of the demodulators and decoders that are in the radios. The embedded simulations of the decoder are especially computationally intensive if the radios employ iterative decoding. We present a method for the direct generation of receiver statistics that avoids the time-consuming embedded simulations of the demodulator and decoder, thereby accelerating the process of designing, developing, and evaluating adaptive cross-layer protocols. The required statistics are modeled as random variables that can be generated quickly, yet their distributions approximate the distributions of the actual receiver statistics. The method is illustrated for an adaptive coding protocol in a network of frequency-hop (FH) radios that employ turbo product codes with soft-decision iterative decoding. Results are given on the quality of the approximations and the reductions in simulation time that they provide. Our method for the direct generation of receiver statistics provides even greater benefits in the design and evaluation of higher-layer protocols that employ receiver statistics.

The statistics are also employed by an adaptive transmission protocol to select the modulation parameters and the rate of the error-control code for each packet. The power-adjustment protocol uses the statistics to ensure that the transmitter power level is high enough to satisfy the signal strength requirements at the receiver and low enough to prevent unnecessary interference to nearby radios. We describe a protocol for which modulation and coding parameters are adapted to achieve the most efficient combination for the given channel conditions. We evaluate the performance of each protocol for several channels. The protocols are not given any information about the type of channel or the channel parameters, yet they are able to use the demodulator statistics to efficiently set the initial power level and adapt transmissions throughout the session.

Specifically, we are interested in bounding the packet transmission delay within the terminal router for uplink traffic in a future satellite network Previous work has provided delay bounds for wireline networks with a fixed transmission rate. However, these bounds do not apply to the time-varying satellite link that we are considering here. It has been shown that the terminal router in a future SATCOM terminal can accommodate the varying uplink RF data rate by using Ethernet pause frames. We show that by encapsulating the pause frame information into two parameters: a window size and the minimum transmission time within a window, we are able to achieve a guaranteed packet transmission delay. We also quantify the tradeoff between the packet transmission delay and the throughput on the uplink.

Their distinguishing feature is an 'ectoplasmic net,' an external cytoplasmic network secreted by a specialized organelle that attaches the cell to its substrate and secretes digestive enzymes for absorptive nutrition. In this study, one of our aims was to infer the phylogenetic position of the labyrinthulomycetes relative to the non-photosynthetic bicoeceans and oomycetes and the photosynthetic ochrophytes and thereby evaluate patterns of change from photosynthesis to saprotrophism among the stramenopiles. For the labyrinthulomycetes, we determined sequences of the actin, beta-tubulin, and elongation factor 1-alpha gene fragments and where necessary, ribosomal small subunit (SSU) genes. Multilocus analysis using standard tree construction techniques not only strongly supported the oomycetes as the sister group to the phototrophic stramenopiles, but also, for the first time with moderate statistical support, showed that the labyrinthulomycetes and the bicoecean as sister groups. The paraphyly of the non-photosynthetic groups was consistent with independent loss of photosynthesis in labyrinthulomycetes and oomycetes. We also wished to develop a phylogenetically based hypothesis for the origin of the gliding cell bodies and the ectoplasmic net found in some labyrinthulomycetes. The cells of species in Labyrinthula and Aplanochytrium share a specialized form of motility involving gliding on ectoplasmic tracks. Before our study, only ribosomal DNA genes had been determined for these genera and their phylogenetic position in the labyrinthulomycetes was equivocal. Multilocus phylogenies applying our newly determined protein-coding sequences divided the labyrinthulomycetes between sister clades 'A' and 'B' and showed that the monophyletic group containing all of the gliding species was nested among non-gliding species in clade B. This phylogeny suggested that species that glide via an ectoplasm evolved from species that had used the ectoplasm mainly for anchorage and assimilation rather than motility. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The objective is to demonstrate the ability to position an X-Y stage with high resolution, using direct position sensing of a dynamically controlled image. In order to achieve high spatial resolution using a pixel array as a target, an algorithm that processes both the geometric shape and the grayscale intensities of the image is implemented. The test platform consists of an X-Y stage carrying a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) screen that is imaged by a stationary digital camera. The pixel intensities on the LCD screen are modified dynamically to provide 2-dimensional position command inputs that translate to the desired stage motion. The digital images acquired by the camera are used to provide position error feedback to the controller. Experimental results show that direct position sensing is possible to a certain degree of accuracy. However, in order to match today's CNC machines' accuracy levels further processing of the digital images is required. A noise reduction algorithm to filter the fluctuations of the measurements in the digital images is proposed as future work, as well as other considerations.

The sensor has the physical attributes of polymer, but is electrically conductive and can therefore be used oil a conductive substrate to gauge pressure and Subsequently load. Benefits over traditional force sensing include reduced cost, full control of geometry, reduced form factor, resistance to impact and to corrosion. A test circuit was developed to Study the behavior of the sensor at different loads and Surface conditions, and behavior over time. Prospective applications on manufacturing and automotive fields are proposed.

ASME					VISCOELASTICITY EFFECTS OF POLYMERIC MATERIAL IN MICRO INJECTION MOLDING								MSEC 2008: PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING CONFERENCE 2008, VOL 2								399	404					2009	2009	An experimental study has been carried Out to determine the effect of viscoelasticity in comparison to viscosity on micro-injection molded parts. In this study, two different polymeric materials- Polystyrene (PS) as a viscous material and High Density Poly-Ethylene (HDPE) as a viscoelastic material- have been selected to observe the effect of melt elasticity on the filling phase of micro molding based on cavity pressure of molded part. All process parameters except temperature are the same for both polymers. Process temperatures have been selected in order to match the viscosity for both polymers used. Polymer viscosity was characterized at different shear rate and temperature. Viscoelasticity of both polymers were investigated using rotational rheometry in the oscillation mode. The mold geometry with high aspect ratio has been used and the effect of viscoelasticity on cavity pressure has been discussed. It was observed that there is retardation on the response of pressure because of elastic response of material during filling. Despite the differences in slope, peak value, area, and cycle time between two curves, they share similar trends. The only difference is their response during solidifying because of material property.

ASME					BUBBLE FORMATION MODELING IN MATRIX-ASSISTED PULSED-LASER EVAPORATION DIRECT WRITE								MSEC 2008: PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING CONFERENCE 2008, VOL 2								497	504					2009	2009	Matrix-assisted pulsed-laser evaporation direct write (MAPLE DW) is emerging as a promising direct-write technology for printing microelectronics as well as biological constructs. To widely employ this technology, understanding of its physical mechanism is of need. In this study, the bubble formation process in MAPLE DW of glycerol-water coating is modeled based on the nucleation-based phase explosion theory. Based on the proposed model, the bubble diameter after expansion and cooling and bubble pressure can be predicted. Although the prediction overall overestimates the bubble diameter during the MAPLE DW experiments, the proposed model is considered satisfactory in reasonably predicting the bubble diameter as a first step endeavor for this complex process. It is expected that the introduction of more accurate models for energy loss should further help improve the model prediction accuracy.

B	Wang, Wei; Li, Gang; Huang, Yong			ASME					MODELING OF BUBBLE EXPANSION-INDUCED CELL MECHANICAL PROFILE IN LASER-ASSISTED CELL DIRECT WRITING								MSEC 2008: PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING CONFERENCE 2008, VOL 2								505	514					2009	2009	Cell damage due to the mechanical impact during laser-assisted cell direct writing has been observed and is a possible hurdle for broad applications of fragile cell direct writing. The objective of this study is to numerically investigate the bubble expansion-induced cell mechanical loading profile in laser-assisted cell direct writing. Some conclusions have been drawn as follows. The cell velocity oscillates initially and then smoothes out gradually with a constant ejection velocity. Both the cell acceleration and pressure can be very high at the beginning period of bubble expansion and then quickly approaches zero in an oscillation manner. A high viscosity can lead to an observable velocity increment at the initial stage, but the ejection velocity decreases. The pressure magnitude decreases when the distance is large, and a larger initial pressure induces a larger cell pressure as expected. This study serves as a foundation to further investigate the cell damage mechanism in laser-assisted cell direct writing to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of cell direct writing techniques.

It is of interest to model the phase inversion-based HFM fabrication process and control the fabricated HFM geometry. The effect of gravity and surface tension which is frequently ignored in general fiber spinning should be carefully addressed in HFM fabrication modeling. Both the volume Of fluid (VOF) method and the scale analysis have been applied to appreciate the effect of gravity and surface tension on the HFM geometry profile. The VOF method-based Simulation results reveal that both the gravity and/or Surface tension significantly reduce the predicted radii/diameters, while the scale analysis reveals that the gravity or Surface tension affects the HFM fabrication process dynamics. Both the approaches warrant the need of including the gravity and surface tension in HFM fabrication process modeling.

Three specific research issues are discussed in this context, namely, the modelling of decision maker's preferences, the development of a concept of optimality, and the development of solution approaches to finding a preferred feasible solution for the overall problem. Two models of preferences that generalize the classical Pareto preference and two solution approaches to a class of multi-scenario multi-objective optimization problems are presented. Illustrative examples are included.					7th Multi-Objective Programming and Goal Programming Conference7th Multi-Objective Programming and Goal Programming Conference	JUN 12-14, 2006JUN 12-14, 2006		Tours, FRANCETours, FRANCE	6	0	0	0	0	6			0075-8442		978-3-540-85645-0	WOS:000267800600026

To increase the initial surface reactivity of the membranes, air plasma treatment was applied for a short time. The reactive anchoring interface was created by deposition of several nanometers of poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (PUMA) onto the membrane boundary. Next, polymers containing reactive (amino and carboxy) groups were grafted to the macromolecular PGMA anchoring layer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and a gas permeation test demonstrated that the polymers could be chemically attached to the PET membranes modified with PGMA. Grafted polymers uniformly covered the surface and did not block pores. We also demonstrated that the PET membranes modified with the PGMA anchoring layer can be successfully used to build membrane assemblies by incorporating silica or titanium oxide microparticles as spacers.					234th American-Chemical-Society National Meeting234th American-Chemical-Society National Meeting	AUG 17-19, 2007AUG 17-19, 2007	Amer Chem Soc, Div Colloid & Surface ChemAmer Chem Soc, Div Colloid & Surface Chem	Boston, MABoston, MA	2	0	0	0	0	2			0097-6156		978-0-8412-6981-1	WOS:000292990100022

Because of their ability to self-renew and differentiate into any cell type, stem cells offer the potential to regrow all types of damaged or degenerated tissues that are unrepairable by currently available treatment methods. Nanomaterials may prove to be ideal growth substrates for tissue regeneration as well as an ideal delivery vehicle for the diagnostic markers, growth factors, and drugs that are required to promote tissue regeneration and treat degenerative disease. Despite their great potential, stem cell behaviors such as proliferation and differentiation must be tightly regulated in order for this technology to be practical in a clinical setting. Experimental evidence has shown that the interactions of nanomaterials with stem cells can have a significant effect on many types of stem cell behaviors. In addition, nanomaterials can be used to provide targeted delivery of various agents in a controlled manner that allows for regulation of the chemical environment. Regulation of the chemical environment is critical for controlled guidance of stem cell behavior and for the treatment of degenerative disease. A precise understanding of the interactions between stem cells and nanomaterials is an important step toward unlocking the great potential of these two technologies.									0	0	0	0	0	0					978-3-540-49660-1	WOS:000268396200001

However, recent practices in offering drugs with long circulation time and efficient targeting, and/or developing new therapeutic strategies are challenging nano-sized drug delivery carriers with more defined biological properties and functionalities. Most nano-sized delivery vehicles and materials currently being used cannot completely fulfill these requirements. To address these issues, syntheses of new carrier materials and modification of existing nanosized materials with tunable properties are considered to be two effective strategies thus far. In this review article, we will focus on the latter. It is thought that through modification one can control and tailor the properties of nano-sized materials in a predictable manner, as well as provide them with precise properties and functionalities. These modifications can bring new and unique capabilities to many drug delivery systems. Recent progress on drug delivery applications for modified and functionalized nano-sized materials will be highlighted, after the methods used to modify nano-sized materials are discussed briefly.									0	0	0	0	0	0					978-3-540-49660-1	WOS:000268396200015

Considering the metal-nutrient mobilization ability of many allelochemicals, it is hypothesized that, along with the reported toxic effect on the neighbors, these compounds could be directly involved in resource acquisition by the allelopathic plant.Using nutrient manipulation treatments in hydroponic culture, this hypothesis was tested using Centaurea diffusa, an invasive species that produces the putative phytotoxin 8-hydroxyquinoline (8HQ).The exudation of 8HQ by C. diffusa was very limited and transient. It was further shown that: C. diffusa utilizes 8HQ for its own acquisition of iron, a nutrient deficient in many of its alkaline, invaded habitats; there possibly exists a unique mechanism for the uptake of the 8HQ-complexed iron (Fe) in C. diffusa, which is novel to the nongraminaceous species; although phytotoxic at very low concentrations, the toxic effect of 8HQ showed a conditional response in the presence of metals, and was significantly reduced when 8HQ was complexed with copper (Cu) and Fe.This study, in addition to elucidating one of the possible adaptive mechanisms conferring competitive advantage to C. diffusa, also outlines measures to negate the phytotoxicity of its putative allelochemical. The results indicate that the exudation of 8HQ by C. diffusa could be primarily for nutrient acquisition.New Phytologist (2009) 181: 424-434doi: 10.1111/j.1469-8137.2008.02647.x.									30	2	0	25	0	31			0028-646X			WOS:000261792900017	19121037

Multiple-class spatiotemporal flow estimation using a modified neural gas algorithm								OPTICAL ENGINEERING				48	1					017003	10.1117/1.3070666			JAN 2009	2009	The problem of estimating optical flow fields corresponding to multiple moving objects in a spatiotemporal image sequence is addressed. A modified version of the neural gas (NG) unsupervised learning algorithm is used to implement a nonlinear interpolation strategy to overcome the aperture problem encountered during local motion estimation. Local motion constraints are formulated, and the best information over four point pairs is used to produce a single motion estimate. Wherever the aperture problem is encountered the minimum-norm estimate is produced. These local estimates are then refined using the modified NG. NG provides a framework for the fusion of local incomplete motion information into complete global estimates. Due to the self-organizing nature of NG the number of motion classes need not be specified a priori. The technique leads to generation of an optical flow field without the smearing of flow fields encountered in regularization-based techniques. Motion estimation results obtained on synthetic natural image sequences are shown. (C) 2009 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

Low bone mineral density, termed osteopenia, is the result of decreased bone formation and/or increased bone resorption. In this study, Raman spectroscopy is used to examine if the physicochemical composition of murine femurs is altered in response to simulated spaceflight conditions (hindlimb suspension). Female C57BL/6J mice, aged 53 days, were divided into ground control and simulated spaceflight groups for a period of 12 days, modeling the experiment profile of mice flown on Space Shuttle flight STS-108. After the study, the mice were sacrificed and femur specimens harvested. Mid-diaphysis sections were probed using near-infrared Raman microscopy. Spectra were collected at various anatomical sites (anterior, lateral, medial, and posterior quadrants) and/or cortical locations (periosteal, midosteal, and endosteal). Chemometric recovery of spectra was employed to reduce signal contributions from the epoxy embedding agent. Mean values for mineralization, carbonation, crystallinity, and other parameters associated with the matrix were estimated. Correlations between mineralization and carbonation were observed, despite the small absolute changes between the two groups. We present more detailed analysis of this data and comment on the prospects for Raman spectroscopic evaluation of bone quality in hindlimb suspended (HLS) specimens.

Fipronil had an exponential decay at all sites. The DT(50) of fipronil in a silt loam soil in Oktibbeha Co., MS in covered and exposed plots was 202 and 177 d, respectively. Fipronil dissipation appeared to be faster at the secondary site (Oktibbeha Co, MS) compared to the primary tests sites. Dissipation was faster in covered plots in AZ and MS compared to FL and SC; while that in exposed plots was similar among sites. In 7 d bioassays, termite penetration of soil cores from primary test sites was significantly greater in exposed plots (33.9 +/- 1.2 mm) than that from covered plots (25.7 +/- 1.2 mm). Differences in termite penetration and termite mortality between covered and exposed plots at the secondary test site were not significant. Average distance penetrated by termites, averaged over treatments and primary sites, significantly increased during the last three years (37.2 mm) of sampling compared to the first three sampling times (20.7 mm). Termite mortality averaged over sites and years for covered and exposed plots was not significantly different. Freundlich adsorption coefficients (K(f)), determined from adsorption isotherms, ranged from 0.14 on a gravelly sand (Pima Co., AZ) to 5.47 on a silt loam (Oktibbeha Co.

We show that the partly inverse spinel CdIn2S4 turns into the perfeet normal spinel, while in GaP the impurity ordering leads to the formation of a new type of crystal lattices. Periodically disposed impurities and inherent structural defects modify, improve and stabilize properties of the crystals. New luminescent phenomena of these crystals, including stimulated emission and "hot" luminescence have been discovered. The existing technologies help us to reproduce these naturally ordered structures and to apply them for new generation of optoelectronic devices. (C) 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Lutchyn, Roman/B-1873-2009; Das Sarma, Sankar/B-2400-2009				Loss of superfluidity by fermions in the boson Hubbard model on an optical lattice								PHYSICAL REVIEW A				79	1					011606	10.1103/PhysRevA.79.011606			JAN 2009	2009	The experimentally observed loss of superfluidity by introducing fermions to the boson Hubbard system on an optical lattice is explained. We show that the virtual transitions of bosons to higher Bloch bands, coupled with contact boson-fermion interactions of either sign, result in an effective increase of the boson on-site repulsion. If this renormalization of the on-site potential is dominant over the fermion screening of the boson interactions, the Mott insulating lobes of the Bose-Hubbard phase diagram will be enhanced for either sign of the boson-fermion interactions. We discuss the implications for cold-atom experiments where expansion of the Mott lobes by fermions has been conclusively established.									24	0	0	0	0	24			1050-2947			WOS:000262979000013

DONOSTIA INTERNATIONAL PHYSICS CTR., DIPC/C-3171-2014				Theory of direct scattering, trapping, and desorption in atom-surface collisions								PHYSICAL REVIEW B				79	4					045424	10.1103/PhysRevB.79.045424			JAN 2009	2009	As a part of his studies explaining how an enclosed gas comes to equilibrium, Maxwell [Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. 170, 231 (1879)] proposed what is now known as the "Maxwell assumption," namely, that when gas particles collide with the walls of their container, a fraction is directly scattered with little change in state, while the remaining fraction becomes trapped at the surface and subsequently desorbs in a distribution at equilibrium with the surface temperature. In this paper a scattering theory is developed, using an iterative algorithm and classical mechanics for the collision process, which describes both direct scattering and trapping-desorption of the incident beam. That portion of an incident beam that is initially trapped in the physisorption potential well can be followed as the trapped atoms continue to make further interactions with the surface until they are all eventually ejected back into the continuum and leave the surface region. Several calculations show that this theory predicts when a system will obey the Maxwell assumption. Additional calculations show that the theory quantitatively explains recent experimental measurements [K. D. Gibson, N. Isa, and S. J. Sibener, J. Chem. Phys. 119, 13083 (2003)] of Ar scattering from a self-assembled monolayer on Ag(111) in which clear signals of both direct scattering and a trapping-desorption fraction are exhibited in the energy-resolved spectra.									13	0	0	2	0	13			1098-0121			WOS:000262978400105

Their structures and absolute configurations were determined through extensive spectroscopic analyses including MS, NMR, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments. The results established that two previously reported khayanolicles, 1 alpha-acetoxy-2 beta,3 alpha,6,8 alpha, 14 beta-pentahydroxy-[4.2.1 (10,30).1(1.4)]-tricyclomeliac-7-oate 6 and 1 alpha,2 beta,3 alpha,6,8 alpha,14 beta-hexahydroxy-[4.2.1 (10.30).1(1,4)]-tricyclomeliac-7-oate 7, were, in fact, 1-O-acetylkhayanolide B 1 and khayanolide B 2, and that the two reported phragmalin derivatives, methyl 1 alpha-acetoxy-6,8 alpha,14 beta,30 beta-tetrahydroxy-3-oxo-[3.3.1 (10.2).1(1.4)]-tricyclomeliac-7-oate 8 and methyl 1 alpha,6,8 alpha,14 beta,30 beta-pentahydroxy-3-oxo-[3.3.1 (10.2).1(1.4)]-tricyclomeliac-7-oate 9. were, in fact, khayanolide E 3 and 1-O-deacetylkhayanolide E 4, respectively. Based on the results from this study and consideration of the biogenetic pathway, the methyl 6-hydroxyangolensate in African mahogany K. senegalensis should have a C-6 S configuration while methyl 6-hydroxyangolensate in genuine mahogany Swietenia species should have a C-6 R configuration.

S	Otim, Samuel; Grover, Varun; Segars, Albert H.						King, WR		THE ROLE OF ORGANIZATIONAL LEARNING IN STRATEGIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS PLANNING IN UNCERTAIN ENVIRONMENTS								PLANNING FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS		Advances in Management Information Systems		14				233	256					2009	2009	Improving strategic planning within the realm of information technology management is consistently identified by top corporate executives as a critical competitive issue. This study attempts to take a major step in conceptualizing the strategic information systems planning (SISP) process and examining its effectiveness. Two profiles of SISP process and four of SISP effectiveness are developed conceptually and supported with empirical analysis. The six dimensions of SISP process identified in the previous literature are grouped into radical and incremental profiles both conceptually and empirically based on the patterns they display. Similarly, the four dimensions of SISP effectiveness from prior literature are grouped into fit and fitness profiles, from which four types of organizations emerge based on their performance along these two dimensions. The results suggest that a radical approach to SISP consists of high comprehensiveness, high formalization, creativity focus, bottom-up flow, high participation, and high consistency while an incremental approach exhibits the opposite emphases along these dimensions. For SISP effectiveness, empirical analysis supported four types of organizations (adaptive, learning-impaired, alignment-impaired, and planning-impaired). Adaptive organizations are adept at balancing exploration and exploitation and they achieve high levels of both fitness and fit. Other organizations are impaired in either one or both dimensions. Thus, organizations need to think in terms of both fit and fitness if they are to align their business-IT plans and thereby avoid long periods of underperformance. Since the competitive environment is continually evolving, they should consider fit as requiring constant monitoring and regular updating, rather than intermittent interventions.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1554-6152		978-0-7656-1950-1	WOS:000288750400013

Bauer, S; Cheng, Z; Wrobleski, DA; Zhang, Q		A Route Toward Wet Spinning of Single Walled Carbon Nanotube Fibers: Sodium Alginate - SWCNT Fibers								POLYMER-BASED SMART MATERIALS - PROCESSES, PROPERTIES AND APPLICATION		Materials Research Society Symposium Proceedings		1134				127	132					2009	2009	Polymeric fibers enriched with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) are known as promising candidates for many applications in textile composites. In these applications, the fiber flexibility, toughness, as well as the fiber conductivity are important parameters. Ideally, one intends to make a fiber which would consist of an interwoven structure of nanotubes and polymer chains. This would make the fibers unique and distinguishable from ally composite materials where the reinforcing elements are incorporated into a polymer matrix forming islands-in-a-sea-type structures. In popular method of fiber spinning based on injection of SWCNT dispersion into polymeric coagulation bath, the concentration of SWCNTs in the fibers is very difficult to control, and, typically, the polymer/SWCNT composition is unknown. As ail alternative to this approach, we propose a new method based on conventional wet spinning technique. The idea is to exploit electrostatic assembling of SWCNTs coated with Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS). Many polymers important for applications, for example, alginate, chitosan, and polyacrylamide crosslink by ionic crosslinkers. Hence, if one manages to introduce SWCNTs-SDS into the network of these polymers, the resulting material is expected to be very strong and functional. We report oil successful spinning of alginate fibers with carbon nanotube loading as high as 23 wt %. The Young's modulus increases up to 6.38 GPa at 23 wt % SWCNT loading. A transition from a composite structure (discrete SWCNTs embedded in alginate matrix) to a two-component polymer structure (SWCNTs incorporated into Alginate macromolecular network) is discussed using the results of mechanical and morphological characterizations.

Ling, HI; Smyth, A; Betti, R		Adsorption-Induced Deformations in Nanofibrous Materials: Freely Suspended Yarns and Webs								PORO-MECHANICS IV								965	970					2009	2009	Current advances in manufacturing nanotubular and nanofibrous materials with high surface- to - volume ratios call for the development of adequate characterization methods and predictive estimates of their absorption capacity. Extremely high flexibility of these materials poses a challenge: their pore structure easily changes upon contact with the fluid in question. One more complication is that the absorption process is sufficiently fast: one hundred micron droplets disappear in milliseconds. This paper sets a physical basis for analyses of absorption processes in nanotubular and nanofibrous materials. As an example, we study the absorption of droplets by yams made of nanofibers and nanofibrous webs. Through our experiments, we show that absorption can induce different types of nanoyarn deformations: visible deformations of the yam profile and deformations of the yam diameter/length caused by the capillary pressure. Using our experimental data and theory, we estimate elastic and transport characteristics of the nanofibrous materials. The reported experiments and proposed theory open a new area of research on absorption-induced deformations of nanotubular and nanofibrous materials and show their potential applications as sensors to probe minute amount of absorbable liquids.					4th Biot Conference on Poromechanics4th Biot Conference on Poromechanics	JUN 08-10, 2009JUN 08-10, 2009	Columbia Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci; Univ Oklahoma, Poromechan Inst; ASCE Engn Mech Inst; ADAMA Engn; ERG Construct Trade & Ins Co IncColumbia Univ, Sch Engn & Appl Sci; Univ Oklahoma, Poromechan Inst; ASCE Engn Mech Inst; ADAMA Engn; ERG Construct Trade & Ins Co Inc	Columbia Univ, New York, NYColumbia Univ, New York, NY	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-60595-006-8	WOS:000270143600146

Proceedings Beltwide Cotton Conferences				2009				860	864					2009	2009	The incidence of stink bug infestations and damage in southeastern cotton production has greatly increased in the last decade. To improve sampling and management of these pests, a better understanding of temporal and spatial relationships in cotton fields is needed. Stink bugs were sampled in commercial cotton fields in South Carolina during 2007 and 2008. Fields were first divided into one acre sampling grids and then sampled for stink bugs (adult and immature stages) using two direct sampling techniques (drop cloth and sweep net) and one indirect method (dissection of immature bolls for internal symptoms of feeding). Geostatistical software was used to map and analyze the spatial-temporal dynamics of populations of stink bugs in the fields. The dispersal of the stink bugs tended to be aggregated. Significant spatial and temporal variation of stink bug populations and boll injury was found. However, there was not a strong correlation detected between average stink bug density and boll injury.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1059-2644			ZOOREC:ZOOR14803021822

The inspection process often involves fitting analytic primitives such as sphere, cone, torus, cylinder and plane to these points which represent an object with the corresponding shape. Typically, a least squares fit of the parameters of the shape to the point set is performed. The least squares fit attempts to minimize the sum of the squares of the distances between the points and the primitive. The objective function however, cannot be solved in the closed form and numerical minimization techniques are required to obtain the solution. These techniques as applied to primitive fitting entail iteratively solving large systems of linear equations generally involving arithmetic intensive operations. The current problem in-process metrology faces is the large computational time for the analysis of these millions of streaming data points. This paper presents a framework to address the bottleneck using a Graphical Processing Unit (GPU), to optimize operations and obtain significant gain in computation time.					9th Biennial Conference on Engineering Systems Design and Analysis9th Biennial Conference on Engineering Systems Design and Analysis	JUL 07-09, 2008JUL 07-09, 2008	ASME, Petroleum DivASME, Petroleum Div	Haifa, ISRAELHaifa, ISRAEL	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-4835-7	WOS:000263618000030

The two degrees of freedom provided by use of two dc/dc convertors enable independent low-level control of the DC BUS voltage and the current split between the fuel cell and ultracapacitor The high-level control objectives are to respond to rapid variations in load while minimizing damaging fluctuations in fuel cell current and maintaining the ultracapacitor charge (or voltage) within allowable bounds. Experiments show that both strategies can be tuned to meet these control objectives; however the predictive nature of the model predictive scheme coupled with its ability to aggressively push the ultracapacitor to its constraint line results in smoother fuel cell current transients.					1st Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Conference (DSC 2008)1st Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Conference (DSC 2008)	OCT 20-22, 2008OCT 20-22, 2008	Amer Soc Mech Engineers, Dynam Syst & Control Div; IEE Japan; Inst Syst, Control & Informat Engineers; Japan Soc Precis Engn; Soc Automot Engineers Japan; Inst Elect, Informat & Commun EngineersAmer Soc Mech Engineers, Dynam Syst & Control Div; IEE Japan; Inst Syst, Control & Informat Engineers; Japan Soc Precis Engn; Soc Automot Engineers Japan; Inst Elect, Informat & Commun Engineers	Ann Arbor, MIAnn Arbor, MI	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-4335-2	WOS:000266709500017

An experimental setup consisting of a commercial NMC Active Probe from Veeco and a state-of-the-art microsystem analyzer, the MSA-400 from Polytec, for non-contact vibration measurement is developed to verify the theoretical derivations. Mode shapes and modal frequency response of system for the first three modes obtained from the proposed model are compared with those obtained from the experiment and commonly used theory for uniform beams. Results indicate that the uniform beam model fails to accurately predict the actual system response in multiple-mode operation, while the proposed discontinuous beam model demonstrates good agreement with the experimental data. The Active Probe is then utilized in an ultra small mass detection application. For this, a sensitivity analysis is carried out to measure the added mass at the most sensitive mode of operation. Results indicate detection of tip masses as small as a few hundreds of picograms.					1st Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Conference (DSC 2008)1st Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Conference (DSC 2008)	OCT 20-22, 2008OCT 20-22, 2008	Amer Soc Mech Engineers, Dynam Syst & Control Div; IEE Japan; Inst Syst, Control & Informat Engineers; Japan Soc Precis Engn; Soc Automot Engineers Japan; Inst Elect, Informat & Commun EngineersAmer Soc Mech Engineers, Dynam Syst & Control Div; IEE Japan; Inst Syst, Control & Informat Engineers; Japan Soc Precis Engn; Soc Automot Engineers Japan; Inst Elect, Informat & Commun Engineers	Ann Arbor, MIAnn Arbor, MI	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-4335-2	WOS:000266709500109

Among varieties of nanoscale force sensing platforms, NMC is an attractive approach to measure and apply forces at this scale when compared with other previously reported configurations utilizing complicated MEMS devices or inconvenient-to-handle nanowires and nanotubes. More specifically, a piezoresistive layer is utilized here to measure nanoscale forces at the NMC's tip instead of bulky laser-based feedback which is commonly used in Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). In order to track a predefined force trajectory at the NMC's tip, there is a need to model the piezoresistive NMC and design appropriate controller to move its base to provide the desired force. In previous publications of the authors, a new distributed-parameters modeling framework has been proposed to precisely predict the force acting on the microcantilever's tip. In contrast to this approach and in an effort to case the follow-Lip controller development, the NMC-based force sensor is modeled here as a lumped-parameters system. However, replacing the NMC with a linear mass-spring-damper trio, creates a variety of uncertainties and unmodeled dynamics that need to be addressed for a precise force sensor's read-out. Moreover, the very slow response of NMC's piezoresistive layer to force variations at the NMC's tip, makes the tracking problem even more challenging. For this, a new controller is proposed to overcome these roadblocks. Using extensive numerical simulations and experimental results it is shown that utilizing the proposed controller instead of the commonly used PID controller can significantly enhance the controller's stability and performance characteristics, and ultimately the imaging resolution and manipulation accuracy needed at this scale.					1st Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Conference (DSC 2008)1st Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Conference (DSC 2008)	OCT 20-22, 2008OCT 20-22, 2008	Amer Soc Mech Engineers, Dynam Syst & Control Div; IEE Japan; Inst Syst, Control & Informat Engineers; Japan Soc Precis Engn; Soc Automot Engineers Japan; Inst Elect, Informat & Commun EngineersAmer Soc Mech Engineers, Dynam Syst & Control Div; IEE Japan; Inst Syst, Control & Informat Engineers; Japan Soc Precis Engn; Soc Automot Engineers Japan; Inst Elect, Informat & Commun Engineers	Ann Arbor, MIAnn Arbor, MI	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-4335-2	WOS:000266709500110

The model is based on three properties of hysteretic materials which have been recently established for piezoelectric actuators. These properties are: targeting of turning points, curve alignment and the wiping-out effect. To describe the anhysteretic behavior of the actuator, we initially separate the nonlinearity of the hysteretic response from the hysteresis looping effect and approximate it with a piecewise exponential function. This function is then utilized in a nonlinear mapping procedure, where it is mapped between consequent turning points recorded in the model's memory unit. This mapping requires two constant shaping parameters for the ascending and two for the descending trajectories. To assess the performance of the proposed model and for experimental verification, a Galfenol-driven micro-positioning cantilever actuator is utilized. The results indicate that the model is able to precisely predict the response of the actuator for its full-range motion including both major and minor hysteresis loops. The maximum error percentage and the average error between the experiment and the model for a 120 mu m stroke are 1.5% and 435 rim, respectively. With using Only 14 coefficients, the proposed framework not only offers a precise model, but also a computationally efficient algorithm to quantify the hysteresis response of Galfenol-driven actuators.					1st Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Conference (DSC 2008)1st Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Conference (DSC 2008)	OCT 20-22, 2008OCT 20-22, 2008	Amer Soc Mech Engineers, Dynam Syst & Control Div; IEE Japan; Inst Syst, Control & Informat Engineers; Japan Soc Precis Engn; Soc Automot Engineers Japan; Inst Elect, Informat & Commun EngineersAmer Soc Mech Engineers, Dynam Syst & Control Div; IEE Japan; Inst Syst, Control & Informat Engineers; Japan Soc Precis Engn; Soc Automot Engineers Japan; Inst Elect, Informat & Commun Engineers	Ann Arbor, MIAnn Arbor, MI	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-4335-2	WOS:000266709500130

Most of today's modeling frameworks adopt lumped-parameter representation for system dynamics due to its more straightforward analysis and control. In this article, a distributed-parameters rod-like configuration is considered for free and forced motion analysis of structure. To Include the effects of widely-used flexural mechanisms, a mass-spring-damper boundary condition is considered for the system. Moreover, the effect of electromechanical actuation is included as a concentrated force at the boundary. The problem is then divided into two parts: first part deals with free motion analysis of system to obtain eigenvalues and eigenfunctions using the expansion theorem and a standard eigenvalue problem procedure. The effects of different boundary mass and spring values on the natural frequencies and mode shapes are demonstrated, which indicate their significant contribution to system dynamical properties. In the second part, forced motion analysis of system and its state-space conversion tools are presented. It is shown that distributed-parameters modeling is inevitable when precision high frequency motions are demanded. This can enhance control bandwidth and performance of rod-like solid-state actuators such as piezoelectric and magnetostrictive positioners with moving to next generation digital signal processing systems which enable ultrahigh-frequency sampling rates.					1st Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Conference (DSCC 2008)1st Annual Dynamic Systems and Control Conference (DSCC 2008)	OCT 20-22, 2008OCT 20-22, 2008	Amer Soc Mech Engineers, Dynam Syst & Control Div; IEE Japan; Inst Syst, Control & Informat Engineers; Japan Soc Precis Engn; Soc Automot Engineers Japan; Inst Elect, Informat & Commun EngineersAmer Soc Mech Engineers, Dynam Syst & Control Div; IEE Japan; Inst Syst, Control & Informat Engineers; Japan Soc Precis Engn; Soc Automot Engineers Japan; Inst Elect, Informat & Commun Engineers	Ann Arbor, MIAnn Arbor, MI	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-4335-2	WOS:000266709500132

For safe and reproducible cell direct writing, the process-induced cell damage must be understood in addition to biological property research. The objective of this study is to investigate the cell membrane stability under the external normal pressure. It is performed by studying the dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayer behavior under different normal pressures using molecular dynamics (MD). It is found that as the normal pressure increases, the thickness of DPPC bilayer decreases and the area of per DPPC molecule increases; and as the normal pressure increases, the rupture force to break the bilayer structure decreases, which can also be explained by the change of free energy difference before and after rupture under different normal pressures. This study serves as the first step towards understanding of the cell damage mechanism in cell direct writing.

In place of a rotary encoder or linear glass scale, a combination of a digital camera and a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) screen is used to actively monitor two dimensional position changes on an XY table. In order to achieve precise spatial resolution, an actively-controlled planar pixel matrix is used as the tracking target for the system. A digital camera senses the location of the moving image displayed on the LCD screen and provides 2 dimensional position feedback. Thus, the liming and the quality of the visual feedback to the controller are the significant factors to determine the accuracy of the system. Due to the long image processing time, the vision feedback of the actual position of the stage is delayed. At the same time, with the slow frame capturing rates of the camera, dead time occurs between consecutive acquisitions of feedback signals from the vision system to the motion controller, which is detrimental to the performance of the system. Hence, studies and detailed analysis on different dead time compensation strategies and path planning algorithms have been performed to select the optimal strategy to address these challenges. Based on simulation results, a proposed method for integrating predictive control with virtual intermittent setpoints algorithm to mitigate dead time problem is presented in the final section of the paper.

Existing wear models relate the cutting parameters of feed, speed, and depth of cut to tool wear. The tool wear is often reported as changes in flank width or crater depth. However, these one-dimensional wear measurements do not fully characterize the tool condition when tools wear by other types of wear such as notching, chipping, and adhesion. This is especially true when machining difficult-to-machine materials such as titanium. This paper proposes another approach for characterizing tool wear. It is based on taking measurements of the retained volume of the cutting tool. The new wear characterization approach is used to demonstrate the progression of volumetric wear in titanium milling.

The objective of this study is to model the thermoelastic stress wave propagation inside the coating in laser-assisted cell direct writing when the vaporization or optical breakdown of coating materials is not available. It is found that a bipolar pressure pair has been developed within a finite thin coating medium, locations near the laser focal spot experience higher stresses, and shorter duration laser pulses lead to higher thermoelastic stresses. This study will help understand the photomechanical stress and its relevance with biomaterial damage in laser-assisted cell direct writing.

The investigations include fluid flow properties, temperature profile and heat transfer as well as diffusion and concentration of carbon species along the Substrate. These properties are examined in a great detail for a horizontally placed substrate. For each physical property, the effects Of Substrate dislocation as well as the angle between substrate and reactor chamber longitudinal axis are investigated. It is shown that the temperature in the gas phase reactions region is significantly lower compared to the temperature profile around the substrate. Based on the obtained results, two new CVD system designs are proposed to enhance the temperature in the reactor chamber section where gas phase reactions take place. Moreover, it is shown that Substrate dislocation and angle change result in physical property change Such as species concentration on upper and lower Substrate surfaces. This study is also applicable to other CVD-based fabrication process such as deposition of any layer, since the methodology of the fabrication process remains the same.

ASME					ATOMIC SCALE INVESTIGATION OF NANOPARTICLE AND FABRICATION TEMPERATURE EFFECTS ON CARBON NANOTUBE DIAMETER AND CHIRALITY								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL MECHANICAL ENGINEERING CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION, VOL 13, PTS A AND B								1109	1117					2009	2009	Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are one of the best candidates for utilizing in the future nanoelectronic devices. However, the semiconductivity property of CNTs varies as diameter and chirality number change. Several nanoelectronic applications require semiconductivity to be of a certain value with little variability. Therefore, it is necessary to reliably produce uniform CNTs with unique diameter and chirality. However, this still remains one of the challenging problems in the large scale production and application of CNTs. In this paper, the effect of fabrication temperature change on CNTs diameter and chirality are experimentally and theoretically Studied. Utilizing chemical vapor deposition (CVD) fabrication process and by conducting experimental investigation, it is observed that a CNT possesses a larger diameter at its base compared to the section far away from deposited nanoparticles. Moreover, using MD simulation technique, it is observed that the energy of the CNTs molecular structure will increase by applying higher fabrication temperature. Usually this energy increase is greater in the thicker CNTs. However, the energy increase percentage is found to be affected by the chirality of the CNT. Among CNTs of the same diameter, the armchair conformation has the highest percent increase, followed by the chiral CNTs. and the zigzag nanotube has the lower percent increase. The obtained results can be utilized in a controllable CNTs diameter and chirality design process.

Cross-stream filtering is employed to obtain the FMDF and other filtered variables. The mean of the FMDF conditional on the subgrid-scale (SGS) scalar variance at it given location are found to vary from unimodal to bimodal, cot-responding to quasi-equilibrium distributed reaction zones and laminar flamelets (including extinguished flamelets), respectively. The conditionally filtered mixture fraction dissipation for small SOS variances has a relatively weak dependence on the mixture fraction, and is not sensitive to temperature for extinguished samples. For large SOS variance the large dissipation is concentrated in the cliffs and increases with decreasing temperature. The conditionally filtered temperature dissipation for small SOS variances is the highest for intermediate temperature. For large SGS variance the dependence is more complex and the pilot gas appears to be playing an important role. The different SOS mixture fraction structures for small and large SOS variances, as reflected by the unimodal and bimodal FMDF, have a strong impact on the small-scale mixing and turbulence-chemistry interaction, as reflected by the results for the conditionally filtered temperature dissipation. The results have implications for understanding and modeling multiple reactive scalar SOS mixing. (C) 2009 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.
