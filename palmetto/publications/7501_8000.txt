Among widely studied nanoscale fillers are carbon nanomaterials of superior thermal transport characteristics, whose incorporation into polymeric matrices may result in nanocomposites that exhibit a good combination of processability and thermal conductivity. In this work we prepared specifically exfoliated few-layer graphene nanosheets (GNs), and dispersed them into two different polymeric matrices, the poly(ethylene-vinyl acetate) copolymer (PEVA) and polyimide (PI). The GNs, generally less than 10 nm in thickness according to X-ray and microscopy characterization results, were found to substantially enhance the thermal transport properties in the resulting polymeric nanocomposite films. The same enhancement was also found in the devices fabricated from the nanocomposites, specifically tubes from melt-extrusion, suggesting significant application potentials of the polymeric/GN nanocomposite materials. The ability for the GNs to impart electrical conductivity into the nanocomposite films was also determined, with the results correlated in terms of the percolation theory. The relative enhancement effects of the GNs at different loadings in the nanocomposite films on thermal and electrical transports are highlighted and discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J	King, Ada V.; Welter, Brenda H.; Koushik, Amrita B.; Gordon, Lindsay N.; Temesvari, Lesly A.								A Genome-Wide Over-Expression Screen Identifies Genes Involved in Phagocytosis in the Human Protozoan Parasite, Entamoeba histolytica								PLOS ONE				7	8					e43025	10.1371/journal.pone.0043025			AUG 14 2012	2012	Functional genomics and forward genetics seek to assign function to all known genes in a genome. Entamoeba histolytica is a protozoan parasite for which forward genetics approaches have not been extensively applied. It is the causative agent of amoebic dysentery and liver abscess, and infection is prevalent in developing countries that cannot prevent its fecal-oral spread. It is responsible for considerable global morbidity and mortality. Given that the E. histolytica genome has been sequenced, it should be possible to apply genomic approaches to discover gene function. We used a genome-wide overexpression screen to uncover genes regulating an important virulence function of E. histolytica, namely phagocytosis. We developed an episomal E. histolytica cDNA over-expression library, transfected the collection of plasmids into trophozoites, and applied a high-throughput screen to identify phagocytosis mutants in the population of over-expressing cells. The screen was based on the phagocytic uptake of human red blood cells loaded with the metabolic toxin, tubercidin. Expression plasmids were isolated from trophozoites that survived exposure to tubercidin-charged erythrocytes (phagocytosis mutants), and the cDNAs were sequenced. We isolated the gene encoding profilin, a well-characterized cytoskeleton-regulating protein with a known role in phagocytosis. This supports the validity of our approach. Furthermore, we assigned a phagocytic role to several genes not previously known to function in this manner. To our knowledge, this is the first genome-wide forward genetics screen to be applied to this pathogen. The study demonstrates the power of forward genetics in revealing genes regulating virulence in E. histolytica. In addition, the study validates an E. histolytica cDNA over-expression library as a valuable tool for functional genomics.									6	0	0	6	0	6			1932-6203			WOS:000307500800038	22905196	
J	Hayes, W. W.; Manson, J. R.								Determination of the Surface Corrugation Amplitude from Classical Atom Scattering								PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS				109	6					063203	10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.063203			AUG 10 2012	2012	The energy landscape of an atomic or molecular projectile interacting with a surface is often described in terms of a corrugation function that gives the classical turning point as a function of position vector parallel to the surface. It is shown here that the relative height variation of the corrugation function for scattering of atoms under classical conditions can be determined by a measurement of the maximum intensity in energy-resolved scattering spectra as a function of surface temperature. This is demonstrated by developing a semiclassical quantum theory of atomic scattering from corrugated surfaces and then extending the theory to the classical limit of large incident energies and high surface temperatures. Comparisons of calculations with available data for Ar atom scattering determine the corrugation amplitude for a molten In surface to be about 29% of the mean interparticle spacing in the bulk liquid.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0031-9007			WOS:000307381900004	23006264

J	Hur, Jaewoong; Stuart, Steven J.								Modified reactive empirical bond-order potential for heterogeneous bonding environments								JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS				137	5					054102	10.1063/1.4738879			AUG 7 2012	2012	An improvement to the AIREBO potential for hydrocarbons is presented in which contributions to the bond order are determined by the local bonding environment around the bond, rather than the average of the environments around the two constituent atoms. This bond-centric approach decreases the errors by similar to 80% in the fullerene-type systems for which the original approach leads to the most severe errors. With the newly developed and parameterized method, energy errors are less than 0.7 eV for a collection of hydrocarbon molecules not used in the fitting. This modified AIREBO potential is expected to be more useful not only for the molecular hydrocarbons and fullerene isomers studied here, but also for the full range of carbon and hydrocarbon systems to which the AIREBO potential has been applied.

The layers exhibit periodic structuring which is attributed to shear instability in the neutral flow. Estimates of the time-varying vector neutral wind profiles in which the layer was embedded are analyzed and shown to be shear unstable in the Richardson number sense. In addition to the calculation of the Richardson number values, we present an eigenvalue analysis of the model of Miles (1961) and Howard (1961) for the observed wind profiles. The calculated eigenmodes have dominant Kelvin-Helmholtz modes for the estimated flow that are propagating to the southwest with phase speeds near 50 m/s and horizontal wavelengths between 10-15 km. The growth times for the waves would have been as little as about 1 min. These features are in reasonable agreement with the observed of E-s-layer structure. The Miles-Howard model has been analyzed extensively in the past using both analytic and numerical techniques, but calculations of eigenmodes for the equations in a case with background winds that have turning and speed shear have not been carried out previously, as far as we know. The difficulties associated with the calculation are related to identifying the fastest growing modes among the large number of modes that satisfy the equations. The technique and the relationship of the solutions to the observed sporadic E layer wave structure are described.									5	1	0	0	0	6			2169-9380	2169-9402		WOS:000307181400008		
J	Kucukkal, Tugba G.; Stuart, Steven J.								Polarizable Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Aqueous Dipeptides								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B				116	30			8733	8740		10.1021/jp300528m			AUG 2 2012	2012	Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for concentrated aqueous solutions of three dipeptides: Gly-Ala, Gly-Pro, and Ala-Pro. The simulations were performed using both polarizable and nonpolarizable force fields, as a method of assessing the effects of polarization in a well-characterized biomolecular system, and to determine whether the models are adequate to reproduce observed aggregation behavior. The structure and dynamics of both solute and solvent were analyzed and the results compared to experiment, including neutron diffraction measurements of peptide aggregation. The polarizable water is depolarized in concentrated peptide solutions, reflecting its ability to adapt to heterogeneous electrostatic environments. Significant differences between the polarizable and nonpolarizable models are found in terms of both the structure and the dynamics of water as a solvent. Although the water shows more realistic structure and dynamics in the polarizable simulations, consistent with enhanced peptide-water interaction, the peptide aggregation behavior agrees less well with the experiment. Neither model successfully reproduces the experimentally observed dipeptide aggregation behavior.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1520-6106			WOS:000306989800001	22747103

Palmer; Hwu, Shiou-Jyh								Synthesis and structure of a new family of 3d-4f heterometallic compounds Rb(7)LnFe(6)O(2)(PO4)(8) (Ln= Sm, Eu, Gd, Dy): Magnetic properties of the Sm-, Gd-, Dy-derivatives								JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE CHEMISTRY				192				337	341		10.1016/j.jssc.2012.04.039			AUG 2012	2012	A new family of mixed lanthanide(III) and iron(III) oxo-phosphate phases, Rb(7)LnFe(6)O(2)(PO4)(8) (Ln =Sm 1, Eu 2, Gd 3, Dy 4), was isolated by using a high-temperature, solid-state method in molten-salt media. The X-ray single-crystal structure analysis shows that these isomorphic derivatives crystallize in a triclinic space group P-1 (no. 2); Z=1. The 3-D framework of these 3d-4f oxo-phosphates are comprised of LnO(6) octahedral, FeO5 trigonal bipyramidal (tbp), and mu(3)-oxo [Fe4O18] tetrameric units interconnected through PO4 tetrahedra. The preliminary results of the temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility measurements for selected compounds (1, 3, 4) reveal antiferromagnetic-like behavior. 1 shows a weak antiferromagnetric ordering at T-N=similar to 7K while others show little evidence of long-range magnetic order down to 2 K. All three compounds have measured magnetic moments significantly smaller than the expected values. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-4596			WOS:000307028300049

Attitudes, Knowledge, and Perception of Fuel Reduction among Involved Publics in the Southern Appalachians: Implications for Responsive Communication								SOUTHERN JOURNAL OF APPLIED FORESTRY				36	3			159	165		10.5849/sjaf.08-029			AUG 2012	2012	An understanding of how identifiable groups perceive fuel reduction will help forest managers develop formal and informal communication strategies responsive to each group's concerns. This study identified three opinion segments on the basis of their attitudinal and behavioral characteristics about fuel reduction in the southern Appalachians and further described them on the basis of general forest use attitudes and behaviors In = 640). A Let Nature Take Its Course segment was preservation oriented and supported fuel reduction only to the extent that it was thought to enhance biological diversity. More trusting of federal land managers, they should be approached through natural history and hiking clubs with messages emphasizing effects on nongame species. A Management for Human Benefits group was most supportive of fuel reduction and was concerned about availability of game and nongame species. More trusting of state land managers and strongly supportive of fuel reduction, they should be approached with messages about human benefits of fuel reduction. A Visually Appealing segment tended to evaluate fuel reduction mostly on the basis of aesthetic impacts. This amorphous group is more likely to object to fuel reduction on the basis of aesthetic issues, such as charring, downed timber, and loss of rhododendron and mountain laurel. Each group should be approached through a different channel, by forest managers from agencies it most prefers, with message content emphasizing perspectives on forest management already salient to the group.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0148-4419			WOS:000307622400009		
J	Farnham, Mark W.; Lester, Gene E.; Hassell, Richard								Collard, mustard and turnip greens: Effects of genotypes and leaf position on concentrations of ascorbic acid, folate, beta-carotene, lutein and phylloquinone								JOURNAL OF FOOD COMPOSITION AND ANALYSIS				27	1			1	7		10.1016/j.jfca.2012.04.008			AUG 2012	2012	Leaf green Brassica crops: collard (Brassica oleracea L), mustard (Brassica juncea L) and turnip (Brassica rapa L) greens are important commercial and culinary vegetables, especially in the southern United States. However, almost no information on essential human-health vitamins [ascorbic acid (vitamin C), folate (vitamin B-9), phylloquinone (vitamin K-1) and the carotenoids lutein and beta-carotene (provitamin A)] is available. Leafy green Brassicas (15 collard, 2 mustard and 2 turnip greens) were harvested at peak whole-plant maturity, separated into younger (top-canopy) or older (bottom-canopy) leaves and assayed for the aforementioned vitamins and carotenoids. On a 100 g fresh mass basis, percent dry mass (14.7 g versus 13.2 g), total (132.7 mg versus 109.1 mg) and free (58.7 mg versus 52.8 mg) ascorbic acid, folate (183 mu g versus 112 mu g) and lutein (9790 mu g versus 8950 mu g) concentrations were significantly higher in younger versus older leaves. Phylloquinone (435 mu g versus 459 mu g) and beta-carotene (11,130 mu g versus 11,619 mu g) were equally concentrated in younger and older leaves. On a fresh mass basis, all vitamins were found to be highly concentrated in all nineteen leafy green Brassica genotypes, with particular genotypes within each Brassica species having exceptionally high concentrations. Findings from this study revealed that leafy green Brassica genotypes are nutritionally dense in essential human-health vitamins C, B-9, K, provitamin A (beta-carotene) and lutein. Concentration differences in the examined nutritional components among the genotypes (e.g. significant differences in lutein concentrations from 5120 to 15,360 mu g/100 gfm) reveal potential differences that might be exploited in genetic improvement through plant selection and breeding.

Influence of Warm Mix Additives on PMA Mixture Properties								JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING				138	8			991	997		10.1061/(ASCE)TE.1943-5436.0000406			AUG 2012	2012	The objective of the study in this paper was to investigate the influence of warm mix additives on polymer-modified asphalt (PMA) mixtures in regards to engineering properties. Twelve PMA mixtures (four control PMA mixtures and eight warm PMA mixtures) were prepared by using two additives (Aspha-min and Sasobit), two binder sources, and two aggregate sources. An evaluation of all PMA mixtures included the following testing procedures: tensile strength ratio (TSR), asphalt pavement analyzer (APA), resilient modulus, and indirect tensile strength (ITS) after longterm oven aging. The results from this research generally indicated that (1) the PMA mixtures containing the additives can satisfy the current Superpave mixture requirements (including moisture susceptibility and rutting resistance) and (2) no statistical differences existed between the control and the warm PMA mixtures for the properties that the authors evaluated in this study, suggesting using of WMA technologies in PMA mixes has no negative effect on the mixture's engineering properties.

Current Status of Genetic Studies of Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency in Dogs								TOPICS IN COMPANION ANIMAL MEDICINE				27	3			109	112		10.1053/j.tcam.2012.04.001			AUG 2012	2012	Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) is a disorder wherein the pancreas fails to secrete adequate amounts of digestive enzymes. In dogs. EPI is usually the consequence of an autoimmune disease known as pancreatic acinar atrophy. Originally believed to be a simple autosomal recessive disorder, a test-breeding recently revealed that EPI has a more complex mode of inheritance. The contributions of multiple genes, combined with environmental factors, may explain observed variability in clinical presentation and progression of this disease. Research efforts aim to identify genetic variations underlying EPI to assist breeders in their efforts to eliminate this disease from their breed and provide clinicians with new targets for therapeutic intervention and/or disease prevention. Genome-wide linkage, global gene expression, and candidate gene analyses have failed to identify a major locus or genetic variations in German Shepherd Dogs with EPI. Recently, genome-wide association studies revealed numerous genomic regions associated with EPI. Current studies are focused on alleles of the canine major histocompatibility complex. In this article we review findings from scientific investigations into the inheritance and genetic cause(s) of EPI in the purebred dog. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The design team consisted of four senior level mechanical engineering students each with less than 1 year of professional experience are observed while completing an industry sponsored mechanical engineering capstone design project across a 17 week semester. Factors investigated include what CAD tools are used, when in the design process they are implemented, the justification for their use from the students' perspectives, the actual knowledge gained from their use, the impact on the final designed artifact, and the contributions of any sketches generated. At each design step, comparisons are made between CAD and sketching. The students implemented CAD tools at the onset of the project, generally failing to realize gains in design efficiency or effectiveness in the early conceptual phases of the design process. As the design became more concrete, the team was able to recognize clear gains in both efficiency and effectiveness through the use of computer assisted design programs. This study is augmented by interviews with novice and experienced industry users and academic instructors to align the trends observed in the case study with industry practice and educational emphasis. A disconnect in the perceived capability of CAD tools was found between novice and experienced user groups. Opinions on the importance of sketching skills differed between novice educators and novice industry professionals, suggesting that there is a change of opinion as to the importance of sketching formed when recent graduates transition from academia to industry. The results suggest that there is a need to emphasize the importance of sketching and a deeper understanding as to the true utility of CAD tools at each stage of the design process.									10	1	0	0	0	10			0890-0604			WOS:000307946900006

Determining these roles requires knowledge of spatio-temporal Fgf gene expression patterns. In this study, we report the cloning of chick Fgf5, 6 and 7, and examine their gene expression patterns by whole mount in situ hybridization. We show that Fgf5's spatio-temporally restricted expression pattern indicates a potentially novel role during inner ear development. Fgf6 and Fgf7, although belonging to different subfamilies with diverged sequences, are expressed in similar patterns within the mesoderm. Alignment of protein sequences and phylogenetic analysis demonstrate that FGF5 and FGF6 are highly conserved between chick, human, mouse and zebrafish. FGF7 is similarly conserved except for the zebrafish, which has considerably diverged. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1567-133X			WOS:000309372200004	22634565	
J	Randunu, K. Manoj; Marcus, R. Kenneth								Microbore polypropylene capillary channeled polymer (C-CP) fiber columns for rapid reversed-phase HPLC of proteins								ANALYTICAL AND BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				404	3			721	729		10.1007/s00216-012-6163-8			AUG 2012	2012	The performance of microbore columns with polypropylene (PP) capillary-channeled polymer (C-CP) fibers as the support/stationary phase for separation of macromolecules has been investigated. Polypropylene C-CP fibers (40 mu m diameter) were packed in fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) tubing of inner diameter 0.8 mm and lengths of 40, 60, 80, and 110 cm. The performance of PP fiber packed microbore columns (peak width, peak capacity, and resolution) was evaluated for separation of a three-protein mixture of ribonuclease A, cytochrome c, and transferrin under reversed-phase gradient conditions. The low backpressure characteristics of C-CP fiber columns enable operation at high linear velocities (up to 75 mm s(-1) at 1.5 mL min(-1)). In contrast with the performance of other phases, such velocities enable enhanced resolution of the three-protein mixture, because peak widths decrease with velocity. Increased column length resulted in increased resolution, because the peak widths remained essentially constant, although retention times increased. In addition, it was found that the peak capacity increased with column length and linear velocity. Radial compression of the microbore tubing enhanced the homogeneity of the packing and, thereby, separation efficiency and resolution. Radial compression of columns resulted in a decrease in the interstitial fraction (similar to 5 %), but increased resolution of similar to 14 % between ribonuclease A and cytochrome c. Even so, a linear velocity of 75 mm s(-1) required a backpressure of 9.5 MPa only. It is clear that the fluid and solute-transport properties of the C-CP fiber microbore columns afford far better performance than is obtainable by use of standard format columns. The ability to achieve high separation efficiencies, rapidly and with low volume flow rates, holds promise for high-capacity protein separations in proteomics applications.					7th international conference on instrumental methods of analysis - modern trends and applications7th international conference on instrumental methods of analysis - modern trends and applications	SEP 18-22, 2011SEP 18-22, 2011		Chania, GREECEChania, GREECE	11	0	0	8	0	11			1618-2642	1618-2650		WOS:000307251900014	22736228	
J	Leksrisompong, Pattarin; Gerard, Patrick; Lopetcharat, Kannapon; Drake, MaryAnne								Bitter Taste Inhibiting Agents for Whey Protein Hydrolysate and Whey Protein Hydrolysate Beverages								JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE				77	8			S282	S287		10.1111/j.1750-3841.2012.02800.x			AUG 2012	2012	Whey protein hydrolysates (WPH) are known for bioactivity and functionality, but WPH also have a distinct bitter taste. Identification of effective bitter taste inhibiting agents for WPH would broaden the use of this ingredient. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of 24 documented bitter taste inhibitors for WPH. Two spray-dried WPH with different levels of hydrolysis (DH) were evaluated with each potential inhibitor. Quinine hydrochloride (quinine) was presented as a control with each WPH. Percent bitter taste inhibition was reported relative to quinine bitterness. Effective bitter taste inhibitors were subsequently evaluated in WPH beverages with vanilla and chocolate flavoring followed by descriptive analysis. The compounds evaluated did not inhibit bitter taste of quinine and the 2 WPH in a similar manner (P < 0.05). Effective bitter taste inhibitors (P < 0.05) of both WPH were sucralose, fructose, sucrose, adenosine 5 monophosphate (5AMP), adenosine 5monophosphate disodium (5AMP Na2), sodium acetate, monosodium glutamate, and sodium gluconate. Sodium chloride inhibited bitter taste of WPH with high DH but not WPH with low DH. Amino acids (l-Lysine, l-arginine) inhibited bitter taste of quinine but not WPH. All effective inhibitors in rehydrated WPH were also effective in the beverage applications. Sweeteners (fructose, sucralose, and sucrose) enhanced vanilla and chocolate flavors in beverages. Most salts and a nucleotide, while effective for bitter taste inhibition, suppressed vanilla and chocolate flavors and potentiated other flavors (that is, sour aromatic), and basic tastes (salty, sour). Practical Applications: The bitter taste of whey protein hydrolysates (WPH) limits their use as ingredients. This study identified effective bitter taste inhibitors of WPH with different peptide composition and provides insights for effective bitter inhibitors for product applications with WPH.									12	1	0	8	0	13			0022-1147			WOS:000307385800019	22809256

Proteins readily adsorb to the polypropylene (PP) C-CP fibers while buffer species are easily washed off the tips using DI-H2O. Elution of the solutes is achieved with an aliquot of 50:50 ACN:H2O, which is compatible with the subsequent spotting on the MALDI target with the matrix solution. Lysozyme and cytochrome c are used as test species, with a primary buffer composition of 100 mM Tris-HCl. In this case, direct MALDI-MS produces no discernible protein signals. SPE on the C-CP fibers yields high fidelity mass spectra for 1 mu L sample volumes. Limits of detection for cytochrome c in 100 mM Tris-HCl are on the order of 40 nM. Extraction of cytochrome c from buffer concentrations of up to 1 M Tris-HCl, provides signal recoveries that are suppressed by only similar to 50 % versus neat protein solutions. Finally, extraction of 3.1 mu M cytochrome c from a synthetic urine matrix exhibits excellent recovery.									12	0	0	6	0	12			1044-0305			WOS:000307355700012	22653465

We find that secondary phases (such as InSb) can be formed upon surpassing the filling fraction limit and these in turn result in improved thermoelectric properties. A maximum dimensionless figure of merit, ZT approximate to 0.9 at similar to 650 K was obtained for the sample with the nominal composition In0.1Ce0.9Fe3.5Ni0.5Sb12. Interestingly, we also observe Kondo-like behavior and evidence of the crystal field effect in these samples. The low-temperature (T < 100 K) thermopower and electrical resistivity of our samples exhibit Kondo-like behavior while their corresponding magnetic susceptibility suggests that the Ce3+ ions are influenced by the cubic crystal symmetry of the skutterudites class of materials, thus resulting in the crystal field effect. Lastly, the magnetic susceptibility data can be interpreted in the context of a second-order perturbation model. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

The executive's key agents in this conflict are his appointees, who frequently play one of two roles: Congressional allies, where they help Congress implement policy and Congressional adversaries, where they fight with Congress to shift policy strongly toward the executive. This article studies how these two roles arise and what implications they have for administrative policymaking. It highlights how intrinsically motivated bureaucrats combined with hierarchical control affect the ability of the political principals to control the execution of policy. I explore how this interaction shifts under alternative institutional forms, and how it leads appointees to "go native." The model makes several predictions concerning Congressional oversight of bureaucratic agencies. An empirical analysis of audit reports released by the Government Accountability Office finds patterns of oversight consistent with these predictions.									2	0	0	0	0	2			8756-6222			WOS:000308233600002

To enable robust and confident industrial adoption of wireless sensor systems, their data transmission performance must be guaranteed before deployment. Moving objects such as forklifts in common manufacturing settings are known to cause errors and losses in wireless sensor data transmission. As an essential step toward building wireless sensor-based manufacturing plant floor monitoring systems, this study has conducted systematic data transmission performance measurements with IEEE 802.15.4 sensors in the presence of a moving forklift. It is found that for a typical moving forklift, its path loss profile can be predicted based on its stationary path loss profile. Specifically, the path loss for a moving forklift can be adequately modeled using a two-state time-dependent model with both deterministic and random contributions. Such a two-state path loss model can be applied to adequately estimate the packet error rate in the presence of moving objects.

Continuous monitoring of several human metabolites can be addressed by using fully integrated and minimally invasive devices located in the sub-cutis, typically in the peritoneal region. This extends the techniques of continuous monitoring of glucose currently being pursued with diabetic patients. However, several issues have to be considered in order to succeed in developing fully integrated and minimally invasive implantable devices. These innovative devices require a high-degree of integration, minimal invasive surgery, long-term biocompatibility, security and privacy in data transmission, high reliability, high reproducibility, high specificity, low detection limit and high sensitivity. Recent advances in the field have already proposed possible solutions for several of these issues. The aim of the present paper is to present a broad spectrum of recent results and to propose future directions of development in order to obtain fully implantable systems for the continuous monitoring of the human metabolism in advanced healthcare applications.									22	0	0	3	0	22			1424-8220			WOS:000308212100064	23112644

Neural stem cells (NSCs) are the most versatile and promising cell source for the regeneration of injured and diseased CNS. However, cell therapy faces many problems related to cell survival, control of cell fate and proper cell engraftment after transplantation. Cell survival is one of the most challenging technical issues as only a small percentage of implanted cells can survive after transplantation. These cells often die in the first few days after transplantation due to acute inflammation/immune response, trophic factor withdrawal, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, hypoxia, or anoikis. To use appropriate size of cell aggregates, such as neurospheres, rather than individual cell suspension, may prevent anoikis and improve viability. Cells in aggregates or groups can form a community to provide paracrine signaling or trophic support for neighboring transplanted cells to be able to survive in the community manner. One important parameter in the neurosphere structure is the size or diameter. If the sphere size is too big, the nutrient and oxygen support for the cells in the core of the neurosphere will be limited or insufficient. If the sphere size is too small, the beneficial impact of the multicellular community may be limited. To this end, we hypothesize that the survival of transplanted NSCs may be improved with the transplantation of multicellular neurospheres as compared to the transplantation of individual cells in suspension, and there is an optimal range of the sphere size to get the highest viability for the transplanted neural cells. Another major factor is the immune response to the transplanted neural cells. Even with immunosuppressant used, host immune response can still jeopardize the viability of the transplanted cells. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been demonstrated to possess immunosuppressive and neuroprotective properties. We further hypothesize that the viability of transplanted neural cells may be further improved in neurospheres coated with layers of MSCs on the surface of neurospheres by suppressing the host immune response at the transplantation site.

The observations were done in spectroscopic mode, and cover the far-infrared lines of [OI], [CII], CO, CH+, H2O, and OH. We have a [OI] 63 mu m detection rate of 100% for the Herbig Ae/Be and 0% for the debris discs. The [OI] 145 mu m line is only detected in 25% and CO J = 18-17 in 45% (and fewer cases for higher J transitions) of the Herbig Ae/Be stars, while for [CII] 157 mu m, we often find spatially variable background contamination. We show the first detection of water in a Herbig Ae disc, HD 163296, which has a settled disc. Hydroxyl is detected as well in this disc. First seen in HD 100546, CH+ emission is now detected for the second time in a Herbig Ae star, HD 97048. We report fluxes for each line and use the observations as line diagnostics of the gas properties. Furthermore, we look for correlations between the strength of the emission lines and either the stellar or disc parameters, such as stellar luminosity, ultraviolet and X-ray flux, accretion rate, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) band strength, and flaring. We find that the stellar ultraviolet flux is the dominant excitation mechanism of [OI] 63 mu m, with the highest line fluxes being found in objects with a large amount of flaring and among the largest PAH strengths. Neither the amount of accretion nor the X-ray luminosity has an influence on the line strength. We find correlations between the line flux of [OI] 63 mu m and [OI] 145 mu m, CO J = 18-17 and [OI] 6300 A, and between the continuum flux at 63 mu m and at 1.3 mm, while we find weak correlations between the line flux of [OI] 63 mu m and the PAH luminosity, the line flux of CO J = 3-2, the continuum flux at 63 mu m, the stellar effective temperature, and the Br gamma luminosity. Finally, we use a combination of the [OI] 63 mu m and (CO)-C-12 J = 2-1 line fluxes to obtain order of magnitude estimates of the disc gas masses, in agreement with the values that we find from detailed modelling of two Herbig Ae/Be stars, HD 163296 and HD 169142.									54	0	0	0	0	54			1432-0746			WOS:000308290100078

Nevertheless, the metal rim of the wheel and the metallic components of the vehicle have a profound effect on the electromagnetic wave propagation between a sensor located in the tire and a receiver mounted on the vehicle chassis. This paper evaluates the vehicle body's effect on tire sensor transmission and propagation; relates these effects to receiver antenna packaging requirements; and describes an antenna design that takes advantage of the car body to improve the efficiency of the power transmission.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0018-926X			WOS:000308435800042

Consisting of four frequency-independent elements and four elements related to loss tangent and frequency, the equivalent circuit is sufficiently accurate for a broadband simulation including the resonant frequency at which antennas are generally designed to operate. Acceptable relative errors are demonstrated by comparing the results of the equivalent circuit with simulated data obtained from a full wave analysis. The equivalent circuit can be used to replace complex antenna models in lossy media and quantify the effect of the loss on antenna performance.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0018-926X			WOS:000308435800043

To mitigate contour errors in a three-axis machine tool feed drive system, the control development in this paper is based on an error system that is transformed into tangential, normal, and binormal components to the desired contour (i.e., a cross-coupling controller (CCC)). Unlike previous CCCs, the controller developed in this paper does not assume exact knowledge of the inertia and friction matrices. Specifically, an adaptive estimate is developed to compensate for uncertain friction and inertial parameters. Lyapunov-based methods are used to craft the adaptive estimate and to prove global asymptotic contour tracking. Experimental results of the proposed controller on the x-y-axes of the high speed milling machine showed improvement of the contouring accuracy compared to proportional-derivative controller and a benchmark CCC.									8	0	0	0	1	8			0268-3768			WOS:000307285400020

The presence of ZnO was found to decrease the hydrocarbon (CH4 primarily) formation ability of Cu. By comparing the surface reaction parameters, it could be shown that Cu and ZnO catalysts (supported on Al2O3) exhibit lower MeOH formation rates compared to their combination in either CuZnO or CuZnO/Al2O3 due, especially, to lower intrinsic "site" activities. The synergy between Cu and ZnO was most obvious in the increase in MeOH TOFITK (a measure of site activity for MeOH formation), more than double that for Cu without ZnO. Al2O3 did not seem to impact MeOH synthesis in any way other than to increase dispersion of the CuZnO. However, it did furnish acid sites for the conversion of some MeOH to DME.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1022-5528			WOS:000307778600009

University employees representing diverse occupations completed measures of self-engagement, organizational constraints, and leader effectiveness. Supervisors provided ratings of OCB. Tests of mediated moderation using random coefficient modeling revealed that leadership mediated the relationship between constraints and OCB for highly engaged employees. Results are discussed in terms of highly engaged workers being attuned to stressors in the work environment that may compromise performance, potentially blaming leaders for the presence of these obstacles, thus causing withdrawal of effort on nonessential performance tasks.									4	0	0	1	0	4			0021-9029			WOS:000307383500002

Different types of parking strategies are considered as potential tools for improving campus mobility and meeting increased parking demand. Limited information is available on how removing on-street parking from the center of a university campus, relocating motorists to park on the periphery of campus, will impact the neighboring transportation system. Although dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) is a valuable tool for evaluating such impacts, most previous studies have used DTA with mesoscopic models. Thus, there is also limited guidance on the application of DTA within microscopic simulation models. The purpose of this study was to test a novel methodology for evaluating the mobility impact of relocating parking. The authors developed a method of utilizing DTA within a microscopic traffic simulation model. This model was applied to a case study capturing the changes in traffic patterns and volumes as a result of university parking changes. The authors found the methodology efficient and repeatable, and identified several simulator challenges with this new application. The case study findings suggest that, due to the significant number of motorists searching for the high-demand parking in the core of campus, relocating this parking to periphery lots will reduce the average travel time, even when accounting for the increased walking time.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0037-5497	1741-3133		WOS:000306511000004

To support online traffic management, wireless traffic surveillance networks have the potential to collect and relay real-time traffic information from a wide-area transportation network. However, limited research effort has been done to provide an evaluation method to assess the wireless communication performance and reliability for use in a traffic monitoring network. This paper proposed a multi-step analysis method to transportation professionals, and analyzed the performance of a wireless traffic surveillance network for online traffic surveillance using the Network Simulator Version 2 (ns-2) communication network simulator, following the proposed steps. Potential environmental disturbances, such as adverse weather, foliage, and interference, can induce transmission errors in the communication network. Following the proposed method, this study analyzed the impacts of various error rates on the selected measure of effectiveness (MOE) - data throughput and delivery ratio. The study considered wireless sensors connected to roadside controllers through multi-hop relays. A relay is used to pass data from one equipment to another when the distance between traffic sensors and controllers exceeds the wireless transmission range. Simulation results quantified the end-to-end throughput and delivery ratio dependency on the number of fixed range wireless relays and their relationship with different error rates and wireless relay ranges. The findings formed an essential foundation for systematic evaluation of the performance of a wireless traffic sensor network, utilizing a simulation analysis process, for online traffic management systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0037-5497	1741-3133		WOS:000306511000005

A two-state Markov chain is used to induce dependence in the precipitation amounts; our dynamics allow for seasonality in the daily observations, a structure inherent to many nonequatorial region series. No current precipitation changepoint techniques exist that consider day-to-day dependencies, the zero support set aspect (the fact that most measurements are zero), and the periodic dynamics of the problem. The test statistic is constructed by applying cumulative sum methods to a strategically devised set of one-step-ahead prediction residuals. The methods are robust to distributional assumptions, requiring only seasonal mean and transition probability estimators. Simulations are presented that demonstrate the efficacy of the methods; application to two daily precipitation series is made.

Using a standard recognition memory task, we conducted a pilot study to examine how 24 hours of tobacco abstinence in moderate to heavy smokers would affect memory in males and females. Twenty-five moderate to heavy smokers were tested following a period of smoking normally and following 24 hours of tobacco abstinence. At each session, participants completed a recognition memory task in which items were studied under full- and divided-attention conditions (a standard manipulation of memory encoding) as well as tests of passive short-term and working memory (forward and backward digit span). Tobacco abstinence significantly reduced memory performance under full attention conditions for males but not for females. A significant main effect of smoking status in which abstinence significantly reduced performance, as well as a main effect of encoding condition (divided attention < full attention), were found. Our results demonstrate that there may be substantial sex differences in the cognitive effects of tobacco abstinence. While preliminary, the data suggest the need for further, more extensive study of how males and females differ during tobacco abstinence. Such information will inform the best strategies for tobacco cessation efforts.									8	0	0	7	0	8			1064-1297			WOS:000307319700002	22369669	
J	Singh, Randhir; Jiang, Xiuping								Thermal Inactivation of Acid-Adapted Escherichia coli O157:H7 in Dairy Compost								FOODBORNE PATHOGENS AND DISEASE				9	8			741	748		10.1089/fpd.2011.1110			AUG 2012	2012	It is well documented that stress-adapted microorganisms can develop cross-resistance to other unrelated stress. This study was designed to evaluate the thermal resistance of acid-adapted Escherichia coli O157:H7 in both fresh and finished dairy composts. A three-strain mixture of E. coli O157:H7, either acid-adapted or non-adapted (control), was inoculated into dairy compost to a final concentration of approximately 10(7) CFU/g. The inoculated compost was kept in an environmental chamber which was programmed to raise temperature from room to target temperatures (50 degrees C, 55 degrees C, and 60 degrees C) in 2 days, simulating the early phase of composting. In fresh dairy compost with 2 days of come-up time, acid-adapted and control E. coli O157:H7 survived for 19 and 17 days at 50 degrees C, respectively, and 6 and 4 days for both types of culture at 55 degrees C and 60 degrees C, respectively. Overall, pathogen survival was non-significant (p > 0.05) between control and acid-adapted cultures at all tested temperatures. In finished compost, the same trend in pathogen survival between control and acid-adapted cultures was observed at 55 degrees C. However, the duration of survival for both cultures was short in comparison to that in fresh compost. In fresh compost with short come-up time (15 min), acid-adaptation provided E. coli O157:H7 some cross-protection to heat at 55 degrees C up to 30 min of exposure. The effect of heating medium on thermal resistance of acid-adapted E. coli O157:H7 revealed that in saline, acid-adapted E. coli O157:H7 was inactivated slower (p < 0.05) with 0.5 and 1 h of heat exposure at 55 degrees C as compared to control culture. Our results revealed that cross-protection against heat in E. coli O157:H7 due to acid-adaptation was demonstrated in saline but lost in fresh dairy compost with 2 days of come-up time during composting. Additionally, the type of compost and heating medium can influence the rate of pathogen inactivation at composting temperatures.									3	0	0	3	0	3			1535-3141			WOS:000307506400010	22827549

The origin of solid-state activated sintering is attributed to the enhanced mass transport in sintering-aid-based, nanoscale, quasi-liquid, interfacial films that are stabilized below the bulk solidus line. Interfacial thermodynamic models have been developed via extending a phenomenological premelting theory and incorporating the computational thermodynamic (CalPhaD) methods. A primitive type of interfacial phase diagrams, ?-diagrams, have been computed, and these diagrams have been validated by experiments and proven useful. More rigorous interfacial phase diagrams with well-defined transition lines and critical points may also be constructed. A long-range scientific goal is proposed to develop interfacial phase diagrams as a new materials science tool. Future studies should be conducted in several areas to achieve this goal, and special efforts should be made to predict the complex interfacial phase behaviors in multicomponent ceramic materials. Potential broad applications are envisaged.									27	0	0	1	0	27			0002-7820			WOS:000307101000002

Stressful environments have generally been shown to increase inbreeding depression; however, little is known about the underlying genetic mechanisms of the inbreeding-by-stress interaction and to what extent the fitness of individual deleterious mutations is altered under stress. Using microsatellite marker segregation data and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping methods, I performed a genome scan for deleterious mutations affecting viability (viability or vQTL) in two inbred families of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, reared in a stressful, nutrient-poor diet and a favourable, nutrient-rich diet, which had significant effects on growth and survival. Twice as many vQTL were detected in the stressful diet compared with the favourable diet, resulting primarily from substantially greater mortality of homozygous genotypes. At vQTL, estimates of selection (s) and dominance (h) were greater in the stressful environment ( = 0.86 vs. 0.54 and = 0.35 vs. 0.18, in stressful and nonstressful diets, respectively). There was no evidence of interaction between vQTL. Individual vQTL differed across diets in selection only, or in both selection and dominance, and some vQTL were not affected by diet. These results suggest that stress-associated increases in selection against individual deleterious alleles underlie greater inbreeding depression with stress. Furthermore, the finding that inbreeding-by-environment interaction appears, to some extent, to be locus specific, helps to explain previous observations of lineage-specific expression of inbreeding depression and environment-specific purging, which have important implications for conservation and evolutionary biology.									12	1	0	11	1	14			0962-1083			WOS:000306897500008	22747636

Prior research has indicated that alkylimidazole solvents exhibit different, and potentially advantageous physical properties, when compared to corresponding imidazolium-based ionic liquids. Given that even the most fundamental physical properties of alkylimidazole solvents have only recently been reported, there is still a lack of data for other relevant imidazole derivatives, including benzimidazoles. In this work, we have synthesized a series of eight 1-n-alkylbenzimidazoles, with chain lengths ranging from ethyl to dodecyl, all of which exist as neat liquids at ambient temperature. Their densities and viscosities have been determined as functions of both temperature and molecular weight. Alkylbenzimidazoles have been found to exhibit viscosities that are more similar to imidazolium-based ILs than alkylimidazoles, owed to a large contribution to viscosity from the presence of a fused ring system. Solubilities of CO2 and SO2, two species of concern in the emission of coal-fired power generation, were determined for selected alkylbenzimidazoles to understand what effects a fused ring system might have on gas solubility. For both gases, alkylbenzimidazoles were determined to experience physical, non-chemically reactive, interactions. The solubility of CO2 in alkylbenzimidazoles is 10%-30% less than observed for corresponding ILs and alkylimidazoles. 1-butylbenzimidazole was found to readily absorb at least 0.333 gram SO2 per gram at low pressure and ambient temperature, which could be readily desorbed under an N-2 flush, a behavior more similar to imidazolium-based ILs than alkylimidazoles. Thus, we find that as solvents for gas separations, benzimidazoles share characteristics with both ILs and alkylimidazoles.									13	0	0	1	0	13			1674-7291	1869-1870		WOS:000307351500022

The kinetics of hydrogen production from glucose, xylose and cellobiose were investigated using pure culture Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052. Adding anthrahydroquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AH(2)QDS) at concentrations ranging from 100 mu M to 500 mu M increased the hydrogen production rates from 0.80 to 1.35 mmol/L-hr to 1.20-2.70 mmol/L-hr with glucose, xylose, or cellobiose as the primary substrates. AH(2)QDS amendment also increased the substrate utilization rate and biomass growth rate by at least two times. These findings suggest that adding hydroquinone reducing equivalents influence cellular metabolism with hydrogen production rate, substrate utilization rate, and growth rate being simultaneously affected. Resting cell suspensions were conducted to investigate the influence of AH(2)QDS on the hydrogen production rate from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, which is a shared intermediate in both glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway. Data demonstrated that hydrogen production rate increased by 1.5 times when glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate was the sole carbon source, suggesting that the hydroquinone may alter reactions starting with or after glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate in central metabolism. These data demonstrate that adding hydroquinones increased overall metabolic activity of C. beijerinckii. This will eventually increase the efficiency of industrial scale production once appropriate hydroquinone equivalents are identified that work well in large-scale operations, since fermentation rate is one of the two critical factors (production rate and yield) influencing efficiency and cost.

The critical condition for gravel blow-off from the top of a roof depends on the building geometry, particle properties, and the wind conditions. A series of two-dimensional wind tunnel tests were run to measure the critical condition for particle removal. The experimental results demonstrate that the critical condition for blow-off, parameterized in terms of a particle densimetric Froude number, is a function of the dimensionless particle size (d(*)) and the building geometry. Results for buildings without a parapet show that the critical particle densimetric Froude number has a power-law relationship with the dimensionless particle size as Fr-d(2) = 8.1(d(*))(-0.44) for the range of parameters tested. For buildings with a parapet, the densimetric Froude number for the critical condition depends on both Reynolds number and parapet height to building height ratio. The experimental results indicate that buildings without a parapet are not always the most prone to blow-off, and that under certain conditions, a small parapet height can increase the risk of gravel removal.As the critical Froude number is dependent on the Reynolds number, raw data from small scale experiments cannot simply be scaled up by using a Froude number. Further, it is demonstrated that the current approach of using the Shields Diagram (or equivalent data) to scale results from small to large scale are also flawed as the motion initiation mechanism is different. Therefore, existing design guides should be re-visited and full-scale experiments should be conducted in order to fully analyze the risk of blow-off. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Attempts to stop the disease through the eradication of infected trees have been unsuccessful. Introgression of PPV resistance for crop improvement is therefore the most important goal in Prunus breeding programs. Due to time- and labour-consuming protocols, phenotyping for sharka is still the major bottleneck in the breeding pipeline. In this context, screening of seedlings at early stages of development and marker-assisted selection (MAS) provide the best solution for enhancing breeding efficiency. In this study, we generated 42 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers from the peach genome assembly v1.0 and an apricot bacterial artificial chromosome clone identified in the physical map of the PPV resistance locus previously defined in apricot. Using a linkage mapping approach, we found SSR markers tightly linked to PPV resistance trait in all our progenies. Three SSR markers, PGS1.21 PGS1.23 and PGS1.24, showed allelic variants associated with PPV resistance with no recombinants in the crosses analysed. These markers unambiguously discriminated resistant from susceptible accessions in different genetic backgrounds. The results presented here are the first successful application of their use in MAS for breeding resistance in Prunus species.									14	0	0	13	0	15			1380-3743			WOS:000307270900032

Different sources of neural stem cells for CNS tissue regeneration exist, including embryonic stem cells (ESCs), fetal stem cells, adult stem cells, and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and so on. However, before stem cell therapy can be a viable option for treatments, many issues still need to be resolved, including low viability, lack of control of stem cell fate, and low cell engraftment after transplantation. Though controlling these parameters is extremely challenging, engineering structures that create permissive niches for the transplanted cells, such as the use of biocompatible hydrogels, is a promising approach. This review will focus on highlighting existing hydrogel systems currently being investigated for CNS tissue regeneration, as well as discuss design criteria for hydrogels and methods for manipulating stem cells within hydrogels systems. Finally, the use of these hydrogel systems as carriers for stem cell transplantation in CNS injury and disease models will be discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Receipt of Post-Rape Medical Care in a National Sample of Female Victims								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE				43	2			183	187		10.1016/j.amepre.2012.02.025			AUG 2012	2012	Background: It is important for rape victims to receive medical care to prevent and treat rape-related diseases and injuries, access forensic exams, and connect to needed resources. Few victims seek care, and factors associated with post-rape medical care-seeking are poorly understood.Purpose: The current study examined prevalence and factors associated with post-rape medical care-seeking in a national sample of women who reported a most-recent or only incident of forcible rape, and drug-or alcohol-facilitated/incapacitated rape when they were aged >= 14 years.Methods: A national sample of U. S. adult women (N = 3001) completed structured telephone interviews in 2006, and data for this study were analyzed in 2011. Logistic regression analyses examined demographic variables, health, rape characteristics, and post-rape concerns in relation to post-rape medical care-seeking among 445 female rape victims.Results: Aminority of rape victims (21%) sought post-rape medical attention following the incident. In the final multivariate model, correlates of medical care included black race, rape-related injury, concerns about sexually transmitted diseases, pregnancy concerns, and reporting the incident to police.Conclusions: Women who experience rapes consistent with stereotypic scenarios, acknowledge the rape, report the rape, and harbor health concerns appear to be more likely to seek post-rape medical services. Education is needed to increase rape acknowledgment, awareness of post-rape services that do not require formal reporting, and recognition of the need to treat rape-related health problems.

The data are the displacement at a single frequency throughout the imaging domain. The goal is to determine how the quantities-(1) amplitude of displacement, or alternatively (2) the displacement itself, the average displacement, the phase or the phase gradient-change within a homogeneous stiff inclusion embedded within a homogeneous background. The results are easily interpreted formulas that show the dependence on the radius of the inclusion, the frequency and the stiffness contrast between the inclusion and the background. Our assumptions are: (1) the displacement satisfies the Helmholtz equation with the variable stiffness parameter; (2) the experiment produces a plane wave in the absence of any inclusions; (3) in 3D, the inclusion is spherical; (4) in 2D the inclusion is a circular disc; and alternatively in 3D the inclusion is an infinite circular cylinder. Our method of analysis is to use series expansions of the solution expanded about the center of the inclusion.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0266-5611			WOS:000307012900005

In this study, we have characterized the structural and biomechanical properties of porcine myocardial ECM. Fresh myocardium were decellularized in a rotating bioreactor using 0.1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate solution. Masson's trichrome staining and SEM demonstrated the removal of cells and preservation of the interconnected 3D cardiomyocyte lacunae. Movat's pentachrome staining showed the preservation of cardiac elastin ultrastructure and vascular elastin distribution/alignment. DNA assay result confirmed a 98.59 % reduction in DNA content; the acellular myocardial scaffolds were found completely lack of staining for the porcine alpha-Gal antigen; and the accelerating enzymatic degradation assessment showed a constant degradation rate. Tensile and shear properties of the acellular myocardial scaffolds were also evaluated. Our observations showed that the acellular myocardial ECM possessed important traits of biodegradable scaffolds, indicating the potentials in cardiac regeneration and whole heart tissue engineering.									18	0	0	15	0	19			0957-4530			WOS:000306586900002	22584822

Specifically, we report results of a systematic study to evaluate the relationship between compositional variation, glass properties and dominant bonding configurations. These materials are important to applications in optics manufacturing where correlation of physical and optical properties is required to predict fabrication behavior and ultimate material performance. It has been found that the dominant bonds in the glass system change upon reaching a specific molar ratio (percentage, %) of chalcogen substitution, between 30<x<45 mol%, changing from Ge-Se to Sb-Se bonds as the dominant bond type. This singularity has been observed using micro-Raman spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. This effect of the dominant bond configurational change was also shown to impart changes in important physical properties including micro-hardness, thermal properties, and the glass' viscometric behavior. Results indicate that the observed dominant bond change was responsible for a constant value in the evolution of both the micro-hardness and calorimetric glass transition temperature. The viscosity was also affected by the change in dominant bond type, breaking the monotony of the viscosity evolution during the S substitution, due to the total strength of the vitreous system which does not linearly increase.

In order to precisely describe the whole process, we firstly build the mathematical model to simulate this problem numerically. Taking into consideration of the characteristics of contaminant flow, we employ two partial differential equations to formulate the whole problem. One is flow equation; the other is reactive transport equation. The first equation is used to describe the total flow of contaminant wastes, which is based on Darcy law. The second one will characterize the adsorption, diffusion and convection behavior of contaminant species, which describes most features of contaminant flow we are interested in. After the construction of numerical model, we apply locally conservative and compatible algorithms to solve this mathematical model. Specifically, we apply Mixed Finite Element (MFE) method to the flow equation and Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for the transport equation. MFE has a good convergence rate and numerical accuracy for Darcy velocity. DG is more flexible and can be used to deal with irregular meshes, as well as little numerical diffusion. With these two numerical means, we investigate the sensitivity analysis of different features of contaminant flow in our model, such as diffusion, permeability and fracture density. In particular, we study K-d values which represent the distribution of contaminant wastes between the solid and liquid phases. We also make omparisons of two different schemes and discuss the advantages of both methods.									4	0	0	0	0	4			2070-0733			WOS:000306793800001

The greatest barrier to establishing quantitative XRD is the lack of appropriate cellulose standards, which are needed to calibrate the XRD measurements. In practice, samples with known CI are very difficult to prepare or determine. In a previous study,(14) we reported the development of a simple algorithm for determining fiber crystallinity information from Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Hence, in this study we not only compared the fiber crystallinity information between FT-IR and XRD measurements, by developing a simple XRD algorithm in place of a time-consuming and subjective curve-fitting process, but we also suggested a direct way of determining cotton cellulose CI by calibrating XRD with the use of CIIR as references.									14	0	0	4	0	14			0003-7028			WOS:000306720600017	22800914

Scale-up fabrication with the ability to precisely control the microsphere size and morphology has always been of great manufacturing interest. The objective of this work is to experimentally study the performance differences of bipolar and tripolar excitation waveforms in using drop-on-demand (DOD)-based single nozzle jetting for alginate microsphere fabrication. The fabrication performance has been evaluated based on the formability of alginate microspheres as a function of materials properties (sodium alginate and calcium chloride concentrations) and operating conditions. The operating conditions for each excitation include voltage rise/fall times, dwell times and excitation voltage amplitudes. Overall, the bipolar excitation is more robust in making spherical, monodispersed alginate microspheres as good microspheres for its wide working range of material properties and operating conditions, especially during the fabrication of highly viscous materials such as the 2% sodium alginate solution. For both bipolar and tripolar excitations, the sodium alginate concentration and the voltage dwell times should be carefully selected to achieve good microsphere formability.									11	0	0	2	0	11			0960-1317			WOS:000306649000025

When individuals from hosta plants were transferred to a fungus culture, expression of the enzyme decreased 1,812-fold after five generations on the fungus diet. Afr-eng-1 was readily detected in the genome of 75% of nematodes from the plant population but only in 38% of the diet-changed population. The gene cannot be detected in nematodes maintained on fungus for over 100 generations. Diet was also associated with changes in nematode body size and in the severity of symptoms caused on hosta leaves. Plant-diet nematodes caused larger lesions and were longer and thinner than fungusdiet nematodes. Nematodes moved from a plant diet to a fungus diet for five generations had the same body size as the nematodes that had fed on the fungus for 100 generations. Full-length sequences of Afr-eng-1 were obtained and found to encode a glycosyl hydrolase family 5 protein. This is the first 13-1,4-endoglucanase and plant-parasitism-related gene described in the genus Aphelenchoides.									8	0	0	8	0	8			0031-949X			WOS:000306639800010	22779746

Resistance to pyraclostrobin and boscalid in Botrytis cinerea isolates from strawberry fields in the Carolinas. Plant Dis. 96:1198-1203.Botrytis cinerea, the causal agent of gray mold disease, is one of the most important plant-pathogenic fungi affecting strawberry. During the last decade, control of gray mold disease in the southeastern United States has largely been dependent on captan and the use of at-risk fungicides with single-site modes of action, including a combination of the quinone outside inhibitor (QoI) fungicide pyraclostrobin and succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHI) fungicide boscalid formulated as Pristine 38WG. Reports about loss of efficacy of Pristine in experimental fields in North Carolina prompted us to collect and examine 216 single-spore isolates from 10 conventional fields and 1 organic field in North Carolina and South Carolina in early summer 2011. Sensitivity to pyraclostrobin or boscalid was determined using a conidial germination assay with previously published discriminatory doses. Pyraclostrobin- and pyraclostrobin+boscalid-resistant isolates were found in all conventional fields (with some populations revealing no sensitive isolates) and in the organic field. Among the isolates collected, 66.7% were resistant to pyraclostrobin and 61.5% were resistant to both pyraclostrobin and boscalid. No isolates were identified that were resistant to boscalid but sensitive to pyraclostrobin, indicating that dual resistance may have derived from a QoI-resistant population. The molecular basis of QoI and SDHI fungicide resistance was determined in a subset of isolates. Polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the partial cytochrome b (CYTB) gene showed that pyraclostrobin-resistant isolates possessed the G143A mutation known to confer high levels of QoI fungicide resistance in fungi. Boscalid-resistant isolates revealed point mutations at codon 272 leading to the substitution of histidine to arginine (H272R) or tyrosine (H272Y), affecting the third Fe-S cluster region of the iron-sulfur protein (SdhB) target of SDHIs. The results of the study show that resistance to QoI fungicides and dual resistance to QoI and SDHI fungicides is common in B. cinerea from strawberry fields in the Carolinas. Resistant strains were more frequent in locations heavily sprayed with QoI and SDHI fungicides. However, resistance to both fungicides was also found in the unsprayed, organic field, indicating that some resistant strains may have been introduced from the nursery.									43	3	0	36	0	46			0191-2917			WOS:000306620400016

Research suggests that north-up maps benefit some navigational tasks and track-up maps benefit others. However, little research has investigated how map configuration affects the important navigation task of judging cardinal direction or how individual differences in spatial ability interact with map configuration in affecting navigation performance.Method: In an aerial reconnaissance task, 16 participants completed route-following, cardinal direction, and map reconstruction tasks. Participants also completed three spatial ability tests.Results: The track-up map led to better performance on the cardinal direction and route-following tasks. The north-up map led to better performance on the map reconstruction task. Effects of map configuration showed small to medium effect sizes. Spatial ability correlated positively with performance of each navigation task, showing medium to large effect sizes. For some tasks, a helpful map interface compensated for low ability. For other tasks, ability facilitated the performance of the helpful interface; optimal performance required a helpful interface and high ability.Conclusion: Achieving high performance at particular navigation subtasks requires two things: using the map configuration that optimizes subtask performance and having high spatial ability.Application: Some aspects of navigation performance can be improved primarily by using the optimal map configuration; other aspects require using the optimal configuration and having better spatial ability.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0018-7208			WOS:000306375300010	22908682

This research investigates the role of information quality in transitioning retail consumers to complete the purchasing process online, thereby replacing physical channels with online channels. This research makes three contributions: 1) it highlights the importance of information quality and its influence on a consumer's choice to use e-channels to purchase online; 2) it supports the premise that high-quality information can convert experience attributes into search attributes; and 3) it identifies four antecedents that increase perceived information quality: higher telepresence, screening capability, channel trustworthiness, and lower cognitive overhead. Data from 309 consumers were analyzed using structural equation modeling and regression.

Although a weak labor market has limited the quantity of turnover, organizations' most skilled IT personnel are still coveted and valuable resources. These IT professionals are also those most equipped to leave their firm and find new work. In order to reduce costs, retain key employees, and manage turnover, managers need to understand the factors that drive quitting behavior. The research model suggests that the utility of present and alternative IT work are key cognitive influences on an IT professional's decision to search for new employment, intention to quit, and, ultimately, turnover. We test the research model using longitudinal data that include actual turnover behavior. The research model explains 44% of the variance in intention to quit and 13% of the variance in actual turnover.

J	Ni, Hui; Cai, Huinong; Chen, Feng; You, Qi; Xiao, Anfeng; Wang, Yaqi								PURIFICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF beta-D-GLUCOSIDASE FROM ASPERGILLUS NIGER NARINGINASE								JOURNAL OF FOOD BIOCHEMISTRY				36	4			395	404		10.1111/j.1745-4514.2011.00556.x			AUG 2012	2012	beta-D-glucosidase has been purified from naringinase of Aspergillus niger to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate fractionation and chromatographies on diethylaminoethyl Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose and Sephacryl S-200 HR, with the aid of prunin used as a specific substrate to detect the beta-D-glucosidase activity by a high-performance liquid chromatography method. The molecular weight of the beta-D-glucosidase was determined to about 100 kDa by exclusive gel chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. Optimal pH and stable pH range of the enzyme were 4.55 and 3.58.0, respectively. Its optimal temperature was in the range of 5560C. The enzyme was strongly inhibited by 1 and 5 mM of Fe2+, Fe3+, Zn2+, Al3+, Mn2+, Cu2+, Ag+ and Hg2+ ions and SDS. This beta-D-glucosidase had a higher specific affiliation to prunin than p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside. Its Km and Vmax toward prunin were 2.59 mM and 18.76 U/mg. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS This paper mainly focused on the purification and characterization of the beta-D-glucosidase from the enzyme complex naringinase, which was prepared from a fermented broth of Aspergillus niger. To our knowledge, it is the first successful attempt to purify and characterize the beta-D-glucosidase from this naringinase, which is considered safe for food use. This study can help interested readers to take further insights into naringinase from A. niger and set strong base for the production and industrial applications of the beta-D-glucosidase, which is useful to debitter citrus juice and produce medical ingredients.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0145-8884	1745-4514		WOS:000306473700002

Potential Improvements in Shock-Mitigation Efficacy of a Polyurea-Augmented Advanced Combat Helmet								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				21	8			1562	1579		10.1007/s11665-011-0065-3			AUG 2012	2012	The design of the currently used Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH) has been optimized to attain maximum protection against ballistic impacts (fragments, shrapnel, etc.) and hard-surface collisions. However, the ability of the ACH to protect soldiers against blast loading appears not to be as effective. Polyurea, a micro-segregated elastomeric copolymer has shown superior shock-mitigation capabilities. In the present work, a combined Eulerian/Lagrangian transient non-linear dynamics computational fluid/solid interaction analysis is used to investigate potential shock-mitigation benefits which may result from different polyurea-based design augmentations of the ACH. Specific augmentations include replacement of the currently used suspension-pad material with polyurea and the introduction of a thin polyurea internal lining/external coating to the ACH shell. Effectiveness of different ACH designs was quantified by: (a) establishing the main forms of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI); (b) identifying the key mechanical causes for these injuries; and (c) quantifying the extents of reductions in the magnitude of these mechanical causes. The results obtained show that while the ACH with a 2-mm-thick polyurea internal lining displays the best blast mitigation performance, it does not provide sufficient protection against mTBI.									18	0	0	3	0	18			1059-9495			WOS:000306549400002

Molecular-Level Simulations of Shock Generation and Propagation in Soda-Lime Glass								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				21	8			1580	1590		10.1007/s11665-011-0064-4			AUG 2012	2012	A non-equilibrium molecular dynamics method is employed to study the mechanical response of soda-lime glass (a material commonly used in transparent armor applications) when subjected to the loading conditions associated with the generation and propagation of planar shock waves. Specific attention is given to the identification and characterization of various (inelastic-deformation and energy-dissipation) molecular-level phenomena and processes taking place at, or in the vicinity of, the shock front. The results obtained revealed that the shock loading causes a 2-4% (shock strength-dependent) density increase. In addition, an increase in the average coordination number of the silicon atoms is observed along with the creation of smaller Si-O rings. These processes are associated with substantial energy absorption and dissipation and are believed to greatly influence the blast/ballistic impact mitigation potential of soda-lime glass. The present work was also aimed at the determination of the shock Hugoniot (i.e., a set of axial stress vs. density/specific-volume vs. internal energy vs. particle velocity vs. temperature) material states obtained in soda-lime glass after the passage of a shock wave of a given strength (as quantified by the shock speed). The availability of a shock Hugoniot is critical for construction of a high deformation-rate, large-strain, high pressure material model which can be used within a continuum-level computational analysis to capture the response of a soda-lime glass based laminated transparent armor structure (e.g., a military vehicle windshield, door window, etc.) to blast/ballistic impact loading.									9	0	0	0	0	9			1059-9495	1544-1024		WOS:000306549400003

This research presents the development and comparison of two models to predict the quality of the blanked edge represented by burrs height, the first model is an artificial neural network (ANN) based, while the second model is a multiple regression analysis (MRA) based. Finite Element modeling of the blanking process was used to generate the data for both models. Both ANN and MRA are able to give good prediction results, however, ANN still more accurate because it deals efficiently with hidden nonlinear relations when compared to MRA. The comparison between experimental and model results shows that average absolute relative error in the case of ANN was < 2.20% for carbon steel and 4.85% for corrosion-resistant steel (CRES) compared to 15.18% for carbon steel and 14.22% for CRES obtained from the second order MRA. Therefore, by using ANN outputs, satisfactory results can be estimated rather than measured and hence reduce testing time and cost.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1059-9495			WOS:000306549400006

The complete blood cell count and differential have been previously evaluated as diagnostic tools for EOS in small, single-center reports. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the complete blood cell count and differential in EOS in a large, multicenter population of neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit.Methods: Using a cohort of 166,092 neonates with suspected EOS with cultures admitted to 293 neonatal intensive care units, we calculated odds ratios and receiver operating characteristic curves for complete blood cell count indices and prediction of a positive culture. We determined sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios for various commonly used cutoff values from the complete blood cell count.Results: Low white blood cell counts, low absolute neutrophil counts and high immature-to-total neutrophil ratios were associated with increasing odds of infection (highest odds ratios: 5.38, 6.84 and 7.97, respectively). Specificity and negative predictive values were high (73.7%-99.9% and >99.8%). However, sensitivities were low (0.3%-54.5%) for all complete blood cell count indices analyzed.Conclusion: Low white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count and high immature-to-total neutrophil ratio were associated with increasing odds of infection, but no complete blood cell count-derived index possesses the sensitivity to rule out reliably EOS in neonates.									27	5	0	18	0	32			0891-3668	1532-0987		WOS:000306572500008	22531231

Temperature and open circuit potential of the reaction mixture were collected to monitor the reaction progress. The polymer is characterized by various techniques including gel permeation chromatography, dynamic light scattering, infrared spectroscopy, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, and differential scanning calorimetry for elucidating the molecular architecture obtained by this method. As-synthesized PANI was found to possess high molecular weight, reduced branching, reduced cross-linking, and to predominantly consist of linear polymer chains. This polymer was also found to be more stable in solution form. JV characteristics of as-synthesized PANI films indicate a high current density which is due to increased free pathways and less traps for the charge transport to occur in PANI films. POLYM. ENG.

In the present study, a fusion gene between IL-12 and mouse sonic hedgehog C-terminal domain (Shh-C) was constructed. The fusion protein was autocatalytically processed to form cholesterol-modified IL-12 molecules and an autocrine loop of IL-12 was established for the sustained activation of NK cells. The transduced NK cells matured more rapidly in vitro with the enhanced expression of granule-related proteins. NKIL-12/Shh-C cells reached the same proliferation rate as NK cells transduced with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)/Shh-C (NKEGFP/Shh-C) with <10-fold IL-2 supplementation, suggesting that the fusion protein reduced the dependency of NK cells on IL-2. The amount of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in the supernatants of NKIL-12/Shh-C cells 5 and 7 days after transduction was significantly higher than that in the supernatants of NKIL-12 cells. Immunofluorescent staining of lung tissues from B16-bearing mice which had received an intravenous injection of lentivirus-transduced NK cells without exogenous IL-2 confirmed that donor NK cells successfully infiltrated into the lung tissues. The survival time of the mice which had received NKIL-12/Shh-C cells was significantly prolonged compared to the mice which had received NKEGFP/Shh-C cells.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1019-6439			WOS:000306154400031	22581115

In a continued effort to better understand the nature of the crystal formation this work studies the role of the cross-sectional geometry on the resultant core crystallography with respect to the fiber axis. More specifically, a molten-core approach was used to fabricate silicon optical fibers clad in silica tubes of either circular or square inner cross-sections. In both geometric cases, the silicon core was found to possess regions of single crystallinity where specific crystal orientations persisted along a fiber length of about 4-5 mm prior to transitioning through polycrystalline regions. However, the rotation and tilting angular combination needed to align a given crystallographic axis with the fiber axis was more constant over the single crystalline region in the case of the square-core fiber while more significant variations were observed in the round-core case. This work begins to elucidate some of the microstructural features, not present in conventional glass optical fibers, that could be important for future low-loss single crystalline semiconductor optical fibers.

Lithium ion batteries have also been considered to be used in electric and hybrid vehicles(1) or even electrical grid stabilization systems(2). All these applications simulate a dramatic increase in the research and development of battery materials(3-7), including new materials(3,8), doping(9), nanostructuring(10-13), coatings or surface modifications(14-17) and novel binders(18). Consequently, an increasing number of physicists, chemists and materials scientists have recently ventured into this area. Coin cells are widely used in research laboratories to test new battery materials; even for the research and development that target large-scale and high-power applications, small coin cells are often used to test the capacities and rate capabilities of new materials in the initial stage.In 2010, we started a National Science Foundation (NSF) sponsored research project to investigate the surface adsorption and disordering in battery materials (grant no. DMR-1006515). In the initial stage of this project, we have struggled to learn the techniques of assembling and testing coin cells, which cannot be achieved without numerous help of other researchers in other universities (through frequent calls, email exchanges and two site visits). Thus, we feel that it is beneficial to document, by both text and video, a protocol of assembling and testing a coin cell, which will help other new researchers in this field. This effort represents the "Broader Impact" activities of our NSF project, and it will also help to educate and inspire students.In this video article, we document a protocol to assemble a CR2032 coin cell with a LiCoO2 working electrode, a Li counter electrode, and (the mostly commonly used) polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder. To ensure new learners to readily repeat the protocol, we keep the protocol as specific and explicit as we can. However, it is important to note that in specific research and development work, many parameters adopted here can be varied. First, one can make coin cells of different sizes and test the working electrode against a counter electrode other than Li. Second, the amounts of C black and binder added into the working electrodes are often varied to suit the particular purpose of research; for example, large amounts of C black or even inert powder were added to the working electrode to test the "intrinsic" performance of cathode materials(14). Third, better binders (other than PVDF) have also developed and used(18). Finally, other types of electrolytes (instead of LiPF6) can also be used; in fact, certain high-voltage electrode materials will require the uses of special electrolytes(7).									2	0	0	0	0	2			1940-087X			WOS:000209225000031	22895280

A novel microfabricated multidisc electrode array biotransducer intended for trauma management has been coated with poly(HEMA)-polypyrrole and characterized by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry using ferrocene monocarboxylic acid (FcCOOH) as a probe molecule. Electrodeposition of polypyrrole (700 mV vs. Ag/AgCl) to 100 mC/cm(2) onto the hydrogel coated microdisc electrode array resulted in large and unstable background currents relative to uncoated electrodes. Overoxidation of polypyrrole (0-1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl, 20 cylces, 100 mV/s) eliminates background current. Dose-response curves with FcCOOH showed that the transducer has good reproducibility with molecules of facile electrochemical properties. Polypyrrole provides interference screening of endogenous interferents in biosensor applications with a 12: 1 rejection ratio. GOx was immobilized via electropolymerization of polypyrrole into hydrogel coated MDEA 5037s to yield biotransducers with sensitivity of 0.045 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2). Changes to improve biotransducer sensitivity are proposed.					14th IUPAC International Symposium on Macromolecular Complexes (MMC)14th IUPAC International Symposium on Macromolecular Complexes (MMC)	AUG 14-17, 2011AUG 14-17, 2011	IUPACIUPAC	Helsinki, FINLANDHelsinki, FINLAND	3	0	0	0	0	3			1022-1360	1521-3900		WOS:000337179400024

Among widely used nanoscale fillers in the development of these materials are carbon nanotubes and graphene sheets. As concluded in previous reviews, the performance of carbon nanotubes for imparting high thermal conductivity into polymeric matrices was generally poor. Here recent results associated with the effort on significant performance improvements are reviewed as an update. By contrast, graphene sheets have emerged as effective nanoscale fillers for polymeric nanocomposites of excellent thermal transport performance, reaching levels that are competitive to those achieved by metals. The significant recent results on thermally conductive polymeric nanocomposites with graphene sheets are highlighted, and their potential applications and issues on their further performance improvements are discussed.									7	0	0	0	0	7			2191-9089	2191-9097		WOS:000208982800004

Four factors were identified: Personal Harm, Grade Inflation, Carelessness and Public/Private boundary violation. Personal Harm violations were rated as most serious and Carelessness violations most frequent. Professional educators viewed Carelessness violations as less serious than did teachers in training. Implications for a code of ethics for teachers were addressed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0742-051X			WOS:000306253900011

However, since the nodes are usually constrained by limited computation resources, selfish nodes may refuse to be cooperative. Reputation systems and price-based systems are two main solutions to the node noncooperation problem. A reputation system evaluates node behaviors by reputation values and uses a reputation threshold to distinguish trustworthy nodes and untrustworthy nodes. A price-based system uses virtual cash to control the transactions of a packet forwarding service. Although these two kinds of systems have been widely used, very little research has been devoted to investigating the effectiveness of the node cooperation incentives provided by the systems. In this paper, we use game theory to analyze the cooperation incentives provided by these two systems and by a system with no cooperation incentive strategy. We find that the strategies of using a threshold to determine the trustworthiness of a node in the reputation system and of rewarding cooperative nodes in the price-based system may be manipulated by clever or wealthy but selfish nodes. Illumined by the investigation results, we propose and study an integrated system. Theoretical and simulation results show the superiority of the integrated system over an individual reputation system and a price-based system in terms of the effectiveness of cooperation incentives and selfish node detection.									49	3	0	1	0	52			1536-1233	1558-0660		WOS:000305705800004		
J	Chowdhury, M. R.; Testik, F. Y.								Viscous propagation of two-dimensional non-Newtonian gravity currents								FLUID DYNAMICS RESEARCH				44	4					045502	10.1088/0169-5983/44/4/045502			AUG 2012	2012	This paper presents the results of a detailed experimental and theoretical investigation on the viscous propagation of non-Newtonian gravity currents. Laboratory gravity currents are generated in a horizontal rectangular tank by releasing a constant flux of high-concentration fluid mud suspensions that exhibit profound non-Newtonian (shear thinning) behavior. Experimental observations on the propagation of fluid mud gravity currents revealed that viscous propagation of these currents was typically preceded by two phases as expected: an initial momentum-driven horizontal buoyant wall jet and a buoyancy-driven inertial phase. The experimental transition times, t**, and positions, x**, at which fluid mud gravity currents transition into viscous propagation phase were determined. The experimental data that correspond to the viscous propagation of fluid mud gravity currents (i.e. experimental time, t >= t**, and front position, x(N) >= x**) were used to evaluate the predictive capabilities of two well-known mathematical modeling approaches: the lubrication theory approximation and the box-model approaches. Regarding the lubrication theory approximation, a recently developed self-similarity solution for viscous propagation of power-law gravity currents that has not been experimentally evaluated was used. Regarding the box-model approach, a viscous box-model solution for two-dimensional (2D) non-Newtonian gravity currents was developed. The evaluation of these models using experimental data revealed that both models were in good agreement with the experimental observations, despite several simplifying assumptions embedded in each. Given its more advanced mathematical development, the lubrication theory approximation model provides a more complete description of a gravity current (i.e. shape and velocity variation along the gravity current) than the box model at the expense of a relatively simple computational effort.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0169-5983			WOS:000305402400003

Oryzicola, is a major rice disease in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia. Rice proteins responsive to BLS are still not well characterized. We took a proteomics approach to identify the proteins that are up-regulated in rice leaves after infection. Approximately 1,500 protein spots were detected on each 2-D gel after silver-staining; those with increased protein levels were selected for MALDI-TOF-MS analysis. We identified 32 up-regulated proteins that might be involved in disease resistance signal transduction, pathogenesis, and regulation of cell metabolism. By using publicly available microarray data, we determined the mRNA transcripts of 23 proteins expressed in the leaves. Seven genes were analyzed by northern blots, which demonstrated that transcript levels were increased after bacterial infection. Our findings help elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying BLS and provide a solid foundation for further research on the functions of relevant genes.									9	2	0	8	0	11			1226-9239			WOS:000305462000008		
J	Boothby, T.; Burkert, J.; Eichwald, M.; Ernst, D. C.; Green, R. M.; Macauley, M.								On the cyclically fully commutative elements of Coxeter groups								JOURNAL OF ALGEBRAIC COMBINATORICS				36	1			123	148		10.1007/s10801-011-0327-z			AUG 2012	2012	Let W be an arbitrary Coxeter group. If two elements have expressions that are cyclic shifts of each other (as words), then they are conjugate (as group elements) in W. We say that w is cyclically fully commutative (CFC) if every cyclic shift of any reduced expression for w is fully commutative (i.e., avoids long braid relations). These generalize Coxeter elements in that their reduced expressions can be described combinatorially by acyclic directed graphs, and cyclically shifting corresponds to source-to-sink conversions. In this paper, we explore the combinatorics of the CFC elements and enumerate them in all Coxeter groups. Additionally, we characterize precisely which CFC elements have the property that powers of them remain fully commutative, via the presence of a simple combinatorial feature called a band. This allows us to give necessary and sufficient conditions for a CFC element w to be logarithmic, that is, a""(w (k) )=ka <...a""(w) for all ka parts per thousand yen1, for a large class of Coxeter groups that includes all affine Weyl groups and simply laced Coxeter groups. Finally, we give a simple non-CFC element that fails to be logarithmic under these conditions.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0925-9899			WOS:000305006400008		
J	Daqaq, Mohammed F.								On intentional introduction of stiffness nonlinearities for energy harvesting under white Gaussian excitations								NONLINEAR DYNAMICS				69	3			1063	1079		10.1007/s11071-012-0327-0			AUG 2012	2012	A significant body of the open literature on vibratory energy harvesting is currently focused on the concept of purposeful inclusion of stiffness nonlinearities for broadband transduction. When compared to their linear resonant counterparts, nonlinear energy harvesters have a wider steady-state frequency bandwidth, leading to the idea that they can be utilized to improve performance especially in random and non-stationary vibratory environments. To further investigate this common belief, this paper studies the response of vibratory energy harvesters to white Gaussian excitations. Both mono- and bi-stable piezoelectric Duffing-type harvesters are considered. The Fokker-Plank-Kolmogorov equation governing the evolution of the system's transition probability density function is formulated and used to generate the moment differential equations governing the response statistics. The moment equations are then closed using a fourth-order cumulant-neglect closure scheme and the relevant steady-state response statistics are obtained. It is demonstrated that the energy harvester's time constant ratio, i.e., the ratio between the nominal period of the mechanical subsystem and the time constant of the harvesting circuit, plays a critical role in characterizing the performance of nonlinear harvesters in a random environment. When the time constant ratio is large, stiffness-type nonlinearities have very little influence on the voltage response. In such a case, no matter how the potential function of the harvester is altered, it does not affect the average output power of the device. When the time constant ratio is small, the influence of the nonlinearity on the voltage output becomes more prevalent. In this case, a Duffing-type mono-stable harvester can never outperform its linear counterpart. A bi-stable harvester, on the other hand, can outperform a linear harvester only when it is designed with the proper potential energy function based on the known noise intensity of the excitation. Such conclusions hold for harvesters with nonlinearities appearing in the restoring force.									62	3	0	0	0	64			0924-090X			WOS:000304878400029		
J	Simar, Leopold; Vanhems, Anne; Wilson, Paul W.								Statistical inference for DEA estimators of directional distances								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH				220	3			853	864		10.1016/j.ejor.2012.02.030			AUG 1 2012	2012	In productivity and efficiency analysis, the technical efficiency of a production unit is measured through its distance to the efficient frontier of the production set. The most familiar non-parametric methods use Farrell-Debreu, Shephard, or hyperbolic radial measures. These approaches require that inputs and outputs be non-negative, which can be problematic when using financial data. Recently, Chambers et al. (1998) have introduced directional distance functions which can be viewed as additive (rather than multiplicative) measures efficiency. Directional distance functions are not restricted to non-negative input and output quantities; in addition, the traditional input and output-oriented measures are nested as special cases of directional distance functions. Consequently, directional distances provide greater flexibility. However, until now, only free disposal hull (FDH) estimators of directional distances (and their conditional and robust extensions) have known statistical properties (Simar and Vanhems, 2012). This paper develops the statistical properties of directional d estimators, which are especially useful when the production set is assumed convex. We first establish that the directional Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) estimators share the known properties of the traditional radial DEA estimators. We then use these properties to develop consistent bootstrap procedures for statistical inference about directional distance, estimation of confidence intervals, and bias correction. The methods are illustrated in some empirical examples. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									25	0	0	1	0	25			0377-2217	1872-6860		WOS:000303787900026

The coordinated development of the AIS controllers mainly consists of two parts-innate immunity (optimal) and adaptive immunity. The parameters of the controllers for the former, to provide optimal performance, are determined simultaneously using particle swarm optimization. For dramatic changes in the ship's power system, adaptive control based on the immune system feedback law is developed. The feedback law adapts the controllers' parameters only during transient disturbances. After the disturbance, the controllers' parameters are restored to their innate values. A ship's real-time power system and the proposed AIS control of all excitation systems have been implemented on a real-time digital simulator and a digital signal processor, respectively. Results from the hardware-in-the-loop studies show that the AIS controllers can provide effective control of all generators' terminal voltages during pulsed loads, restoring and stabilizing them quickly.									15	0	0	0	0	15			0278-0046			WOS:000302545700007

Longitudinally-graded optical fibers								OPTICS EXPRESS				20	16			17393	17401		10.1364/OE.20.017393			JUL 30 2012	2012	Optical fibers have become ubiquitous tools for the creation, propagation, manipulation, and detection of light. However, while the intensity of light propagating through the fiber can increase or decrease along the length through amplification or attenuation, respectively, the properties of the fiber itself generally do not, thus removing an opportunity to further control the behavior of light and performance of fiber-based devices. Shown here are optical fibers that exhibit significant changes in their longitudinal optical properties, specifically a tailored longitudinal numerical aperture change of about 12% over less than 20 meters of length. This is about 1900 times greater than previously reported. The Brillouin gain coefficient was found to decrease by over 6 dB relative to a standard commercial single mode fiber. Next generation analogs are expected to exhibit more than a 10 dB reduction in SBS gain using larger, yet still reasonably manufacturable gradients over practical lengths.

Here we show that poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers of both generations 1 (G1) and 4 (G4) can host 1 fullerenol per 2 dendrimer primary amines as evidenced by isothermal titration calorimetry, dynamic light scattering, and spectrofluorometry. Thermodynamically, the interactions were similarly spontaneous between both generations of dendrimers and fullerenols, however, G4 formed stronger complexes with fullerenols resulting from their higher surface charge density and more internal voids, as demonstrated by spectrofluorometry. In addition to hydrogen bonding that existed between the dendrimer primary amines and the fullerenol oxygens, hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions also contributed to complex formation and dynamics. Such a hybrid of soft and condensed nanoassembly may have implications for environmental remediation of discharged nanomaterials and entail new applications in drug delivery.									5	1	0	2	0	6			1932-7447			WOS:000306725200070	23185644

The coated films were composed of natural materials based on biodegradable and biocompatible polymers, which exhibit excellent oxygen-barrier properties compared with neat PLA films. Thus, these films can contribute toward effectively reducing environmental pollution. The chitosan/clay nanocomposite solutions were effectively dispersed through the clay using an ultrasonic bath and homogenizer. The barrier and morphology properties of the PLA films were tested by measuring selected film properties such as oxygen transmission rate (OTR), water vapor transmission rate (WVTR), field emission scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscope. OTR values measured using the chitosan and chitosan/clay nanocomposite coatings were significantly lower than those measured for neat PLA film. WVTR values measured using chitosan/clay nanocomposite coatings were also lower than those measured for neat PLA film and PLA film coated with chitosan. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Inheritance studies have shown that the rumpless (Rp) and ear-tufted (Et) loci each act in an autosomal dominant fashion, segregate independently, and are associated with an increased rate of embryonic mortality. To find genomic regions associated with Rp and Et, we generated genome-wide SNP profiles for a diverse population of 60 Araucana chickens using the 60 K chicken SNP BeadChip. Genome-wide association studies using 40 rumpless and 11 tailed birds showed a strong association with rumpless on Gga 2 (P-raw = 2.45x10(-10), P-genome = 0.00575), and analysis of genotypes revealed a 2.14 Mb haplotype shared by all rumpless birds. Within this haplotype, a 0.74 Mb critical interval containing two Iroquois homeobox genes, Irx1 and Irx2, was unique to rumpless Araucana chickens. Irx1 and Irx2 are central for developmental prepatterning, but neither gene is known to have a role in mechanisms leading to caudal development. A second genome-wide association analysis using 30 ear-tufted and 28 non-tufted birds revealed an association with tufted on Gga 15 (P-raw = 6.61x10(-7), P-genome = 0.0981). We identified a 0.58 Mb haplotype common to tufted birds and harboring 7 genes. Because homozygosity for Et is nearly 100% lethal, we employed a heterozygosity mapping approach to prioritize candidate gene selection. A 60 kb region heterozygous in all Araucana chickens contains the complete coding sequence for TBX1 and partial sequence for GNB1L. TBX1 is an important transcriptional regulator of embryonic development and a key genetic determinant of human DiGeorge syndrome. Herein, we describe localization of Rp and Et and identification of positional candidate genes.									8	4	0	9	0	12			1932-6203			WOS:000306687700030	22844420	
J	McAlister, Justin S.; Moran, Amy L.

However, few studies have examined the relationships among egg size, composition, and energetic content in a phylogenetically controlled context. We investigated the associations among egg size, composition, and energy using a comparative system, geminate species formed by the closure of the Central American Seaway. We examined western Atlantic (WA) and eastern Pacific (EP) species in three echinoid genera, Echinometra, Eucidaris, and Diadema. In the genus with the largest difference in egg size between geminates (Echinometra), the eggs of WA species were larger, lipid rich and protein poor compared to the smaller eggs of their EP geminate. In addition, the larger WA eggs had significantly greater total egg energy and summed biochemical constituents yet significantly lower egg energy density (energy-per-unit-volume). However, the genera with smaller (Eucidaris) or no (Diadema) differences in egg size were not significantly different in summed biochemical constituents, total egg energy, or energy density. Theoretical models generally assume a strong tradeoff between egg size and fecundity that limits energetic investment and constrains life history evolution. We show that even among closely-related taxa, large eggs cannot be assumed to be scaled-up small eggs either in terms of energy or composition. Although our data comes exclusively from echinoid echinoderms, this pattern may be generalizable to other marine invertebrate taxa. Because egg composition and egg size do not necessarily evolve in lockstep, selective factors such as sperm limitation could act on egg volume without necessarily affecting maternal or larval energetics.									6	0	0	6	0	6			1932-6203			WOS:000306687700122	22911821

Growth and flowering responses of Petunia x hybrida to different photoperiods, light qualities and temperatures. Does light quality affect photosynthetic apparatus of petunia? - Phyton (Horn, Austria) 52 (1): 163-175.Factorial combinations of two photoperiods (10 and 14 hd(-1)), two day temperatures (20 and 26 degrees C) and two light qualities Red (R) and Far red (FR) were imposed on growth, flowering development and chlorophyll fluorescence of Petunia x hybrida VILM. plants grown for 6 weeks in growth chambers. 14 hd(-1) photoperiod decreased the day to flowering by 8 d while the days to flower (DF) were on average 3.1 longer under R light compared to FR light. Light intensity was on average 5.38 higher under R light compared to FR light. Stem dry weight was on average 0.17 g higher when temperature was 20 degrees C as compared to 26 degrees C. Leaf dry weight can effect by temperature and light quality while the interaction between them can affect the number of lateral shoots and the number of unflowering buds. Light quality can affect the number of flowers. The differences in flowering, height and weight observed for petunia suggest that they may be useful sources of variability for petunia breeding programs. Additionally temperature and photoperiod under FR light quality didn't affect the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters while under R light the maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm) decreased significantly.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0079-2047			WOS:000306637500008

We show that solutions of these models exactly conserve model quantities for the integral invariants of fundamental physical importance: kinetic energy, helicity, and (in two dimensions) enstrophy. The kinetic energy conservation is the key that allows us to next apply the phenomenology of homogeneous, isotropic turbulence to establish the existence of a model energy cascade and, in particular, that the cascade exhibits enhanced energy dissipation in a secondary accelerated cascade, which ends at the model's microscale (which we establish is larger than the Kolmogorov microscale). We also prove that the model dissipates energy at the same rate as true turbulent flow,?similar to?O(U3?/?L), independent of Reynolds number. Lastly, we prove the existence of global attractors for the model solutions; the proof of which also shows that solutions are actually one degree of regularity higher than previously known.

Cage-filling by guest atoms has thus become an important approach to reducing the lattice thermal conductivity and optimizing the thermoelectric performance. To probe the impact of filler atoms on lattice dynamics, we herein reported specific heat measurements in two single-filled skutterudite samples In0.2Co4Sb12 and Yb0.2Co4Sb12, and a double-filled skutterudite sample In0.2Yb0.2Co4Sb12. The low temperature specific heat data was analyzed in the context of combined electronic specific heat (the Sommerfeld term), the Debye mode (long wavelength acoustic phonon modes), and the Einstein modes (localized vibration modes). We found that the specific heat difference between the single and double-filled samples can be well accounted by one extra Einstein mode, as expected from the extra filler atom and confirmed by the results of inelastic neutron scattering measurements. Interestingly, two Einstein modes, in addition to the Sommerfeld term and the Debye term, are needed to satisfactorily account for the specific heat of the single-filled sample. The Einstein mode with lower frequency has the frequency close to the low-lying mode reported in La, Ce, Tl single-filled skutterudites, this mode is largely unaffected when the second type of filler atoms is introduced. The frequency of this mode has been verified by inelastic neutron scattering measurement. The other Einstein mode with higher frequency may be originated from the motion of Sb atoms.

Carbon accumulates rapidly for the first 20 years of succession, but few studies have considered forests older than 20 years, and the available data do not yield a consistent pattern. Two alternative hypotheses have been proposed: (1) an asymptotic increase, with the highest carbon stocks occurring in the oldest stands, and (2) an intermediate peak, caused by roughly synchronous tree maturity (and thus high carbon stocks) after which time treefall gaps cause carbon stocks to regress. Here we revisited a well-studied tropical moist forest chronosequence in Barro Colorado Nature Monument, Central Panama, consisting of 35, 55, 85, and 115-year-old stands, as well as old-growth stands, to determine whether past evidence for the intermediate peak hypothesis was influenced by the spatial limitations of the field plots used to assess forest structure. We used airborne LiDAR (light detection and ranging) to measure carbon stocks at the scale of the original transects (0.16 ha), in surrounding forest of the same age (up to 20 ha), and at a landscape scale incorporating thousands of hectares not previously measured. We also compared forest structure as measured in three dimensions by LiDAR, considering vertical and horizontal variation in canopy organization, as well as the abundance of treefall gaps. Our results suggested a strong scale-dependence of aboveground carbon accumulation, supporting the intermediate peak hypothesis at the fine scale of the 0.16-ha transects, but an asymptotic model at the landscape scale incorporating thousands of hectares. Further analyses of forest structure suggest that both the limitations of small plots and intrinsic scaling of forest structure and carbon dynamics account for the scale-dependence of aboveground carbon accumulation in this secondary forest matrix.

Harvesting was used to create seven canopy treatments, four with uniformly distributed canopies at different residual basal areas [Control (16.2 m(2)/ha), MedBA (9.0 m(2)/ha), LowBA (6.4 m(2)/ha), and Clearcut (0 m(2)/ha)] and three circular gaps defined by area [LG (similar to 5281 m(2)), MG (similar to 3217 m(2)), and SG (similar to 1576 m(2))]. Within each canopy treatment, we applied three cultural treatments designed to benefit planted seedling early growth: no treatment (NT), herbicide (H), and herbicide plus fertilization (H + F). Three growing seasons after planting, seedling survival significantly differed among canopy treatments; compared to Controls, Clearcut plots had higher survival (80.6%). H and H + F treatments did not affect seedling survival in the first two years after application. Canopy removal generally increased seedling root collar diameter (RCD) but interacted with cultural treatments. NT within Controls had the smallest RCD, and H + F within Clearcuts had the largest RCD. Canopy treatments significantly affected the percentage of seedlings in height growth (i.e., terminal bud >15 cm high); Control plots had a significantly lower percentage of seedlings in height growth than other canopy treatments. H and H + F treatments also significantly increased the percentage of seedlings in height growth when compared to NT. Our results indicate that canopy removal improves early establishment of longleaf pine seedlings and that herbicides may additionally be used to increase early longleaf pine seedling growth. Our results are similar to those reported in previous studies conducted in mature longleaf pine stands. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The genome project provides new insight and data into how an aquatic crustacean may respond to environmental stressors, including toxicants. We cloned Daphnia pulex HR96 (DappuHR96), a nuclear receptor orthologous to the CAR/PXR/VDR group of nuclear receptors. In Drosophila melanogaster, (hormone receptor 96) HR96 responds to phenobarbital exposure and has been hypothesized as a toxicant receptor. Therefore, we set up a transactivation assay to test whether DappuHR96 is a promiscuous receptor activated by xenobiotics and endobiotics similar to the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and the pregnane X-receptor (PXR). Transactivation assays performed with a GAL4-HR96 chimera demonstrate that HR96 is a promiscuous toxicant receptor activated by a diverse set of chemicals such as pesticides, hormones, and fatty acids. Several environmental toxicants activate HR96 including estradiol, pyriproxyfen, chlorpyrifos, atrazine, and methane arsonate. We also observed repression of HR96 activity by chemicals such as triclosan, androstanol, and fluoxetine. Nearly 50% of the chemicals tested activated or inhibited HR96. Interestingly, unsaturated fatty acids were common activators or inhibitors of HR96 activity, indicating a link between diet and toxicant response. The omega-6 and omega-9 unsaturated fatty acids linoleic and oleic acid activated HR96, but the omega-3 unsaturated fatty acids alpha-linolenic acid and docosahexaenoic acid inhibited HR96, suggesting that these two distinct sets of lipids perform opposing roles in Daphnia physiology. This also provides a putative mechanism by which the ratio of dietary unsaturated fats may affect the ability of an organism to respond to a toxic insult.

The potential effects of bioactive peptides were submitted to bioactivity screening with ACE inhibitory activity, antioxidant property, and anticoagulation activity. Bioactive peptides from egg white protein were characterized by LC tandem mass spectrometric, and secondary structures of those peptides were investigated by FT-IR. Our results showed that total 11 bioactive peptides with three new and eight known structures were identified with LC/MS/MS, which then were synthesized by Fmoc solid phase method. Peptide Thr-Asn-Gly-Ile-Ile-Arg (INCUR) exhibited higher activity against ACE to other two new peptides. The concentration of the peptide TNGIIR, necessary to inhibit 50% the activity of ACE was 70 mu M. Results also suggested that the secondary structural differences between peptides could also influence the ACE inhibition capacity. Thus, it appears that primary and secondary structure of peptide plays the potential role inhibiting the ACE activity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Efficient Stabilization of Phosphodiester (PO), Phosphorothioate (PS), and 2 '-O-Methoxy (2 '-OMe) DNA"RNA Hybrid Duplexes by Amino Sugars								BIOCHEMISTRY				51	27			5496	5505		10.1021/bi3004507			JUL 10 2012	2012	Antisense strategies that target DNARNA hybrid structures offer potential for the development of new therapeutic drugs. The alpha-sarcin loop region of the 16S rRNA domain has been shown to be a high value target for such strategies. Herein, aminoglycoside interaction with three RNA.DNA a-sarcin targeted duplexes (rR.dY, rRS-dY, and rR2'OMe-rY) have been investigated to determine the overall effect of aminoglycoside interaction on the stability, affinity, and conformation of these hybrid duplexes. To this end, UV thermal denaturation, circular dichroism spectroscopy, fluorescence intercalator displacement, and ITC as well as DSC calorimetry experiments were carried out. The results suggest the following. (1) Of all the aminoglycosides studied, neomycin confers the highest thermal stability on all three hybrid duplexes studied. (2) There is no appreciable difference in aminoglycoside-induced thermal stability between the unmodified 'RAY and phophorothioate modified rR.S-dY duplexes. (3) The rR.2'OMe-rY duplexes thermal stability is slightly less than the other two hybrids. (4) In all three duplexes, aminoglycoside-induced thermal stability decreased as the number of amino groups decreased. (5) CD scans revealed similar spectra for the rR.dY and rRS-dY duplexes as well as a more pronounced A-form signal for the rR.2'OMe-rY duplex. (6) FID assays paralleled the CD results, yielding similar affinity values between the rR.dY and rRS-dY duplexes and higher affinities with the rR.2'OMe-rY duplex. (7) The overall affinity trend between aminoglycosides and the three duplexes was determined to be neomycin > paromomycin > neamine > ribostamycin. (8) ITC K-a values revealed similar binding constants for the rR.dY and rR.S-dY duplexes with rRdY having a K1 of (1.03 +/- 0.58) X 10(7) M-1 and K-2 of (1.13 +/- 0.07) X 10(5) M-1 while rR.S-dY produced a K-1 of (1.17 +/- 0.54) X 10(7) M-1 and K-2 of (1.27 +/- 0.69) X 10(5) M-1. (8) The rR.2'OMe-rY produced a slightly higher binding constant values with a K-1 of (1.25 +/- 0.24) X 10(7) M-1 and K-2 of (3.62 +/- 0.18) x 10(5) M-1. (9) The Delta T-m-derived K-Tm of 3.81 x 10(7) M-1 for rR.S-dY was in relative agreement with the corresponding K-1 of 1.17 X 10(7) M-1 derived constant from the fitted ITC. These results illustrate that the increased DNA.RNA hybrid duplex stability in the presence of aminoglycosides can help extend the roles of aminoglycosides in designing modified ODNs for targeting RNA.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0006-2960			WOS:000306203100013	22639785

We sought to compare niche models developed via classic (correlative only), niche (process-based information), and hybridized (correlative augmented with process-based derived information) approaches, with the goal of determining if the added effort of process-based model development yielded better model fit. Correlative data layers (i.e., habitat models) included vegetation community types. Euclidean distance statistics, neighborhood analyses, and topographically-derived information. Mechanistic data layers were estimates of thermal suitability derived from field-collected datasets and biophysical calculations, and estimates of prey biomass interpolated from monitoring stations. We applied these models at high resolution (1 m x 1 m pixel size) to habitat occupied by a population of Texas horned lizards (Phrynosoma cornutum) located in central Oklahoma. Results suggested that our treatment of process-based information offered dramatically better identification of suitable habitat when compared to correlative information, but that these results were likely due to low variability of niche variable pixel values. Niche layers nearly perfectly predicted lizard locations; the interpretation of these results suggest that lizards occupy habitat based on thermal suitability over the duration of a field season. Given the low variability observed in thermal suitability layers, we question the ecological reality of these predictions. Correlative models may accurately describe the niche at small spatial scales, and may suffice in situations where time and financial resources are limiting constraints on project goals. Process-based information continues to be an important part of the niche, and may offer additional predictive accuracy via correlative approaches when included in an ecologically meaningful context.

Substrate-Baited Nanoparticles: A Catch and Release Strategy for Enzyme Recognition and Harvesting								SMALL				8	13			2083	2090		10.1002/smll.201200013			JUL 9 2012	2012	The isolation of a single type of protein from a complex mixture is vital for the characterization of the function, structure, and interactions of the protein of interest and is typically the most laborious aspect of the protein purification process. In this work, a model system is utilized to show the efficacy of synthesizing a baited nanoparticle to capture and recycle enzymes (proteins that catalyze chemical reactions) from crude cell lysate. Enzyme trapping and recycling is illustrated with the carbazole 1,9a-dioxygenase (CARDO) system, an enzyme important in bioremediation and natural product synthesis. The enzymes are baited with azide-modified carbazolyl moieties attached to poly(propargyl acrylate) nanoparticles through a click transformation. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis indicates the single-step procedure to immobilize the enzymes on the particles is capable of significantly concentrating the protein from raw lysate and sequestering all required components of the protein to maintain bioactivity. These results establish a universal model applicable to concentrating and extracting known substrateprotein pairs, but it can be an invaluable tool in recognizing unknown proteinligand affinities.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1613-6810			WOS:000306011500017	22532510

Specifically, at lower voltages, charge storage is achieved by swapping co-ions in the pore with counterions in the bulk electrolyte. As voltage increases, further charge storage is due mainly to the removal of co-ions from the pore, leading to a capacitance increase. The capacitance eventually reaches a maximum when all co-ions are expelled from the pore. At even higher electrode voltages, additional charge storage is realized by counterion insertion into the pore, accompanied by a reduction of capacitance. The molecular mechanisms of these observations are elucidated and provide useful insight for optimizing energy storage based on supercapacitors.									35	0	0	0	0	35			1948-7185			WOS:000306251900002	26291851

This gap, also called minigap, facilitates experimental detection of the pristine TS state and MFs at experimentally accessible temperatures T << E-qp. Here, we show that the linear scaling of minigap with E-qp can fail in quasi-1D wires with multiple confinement bands when the applied Zeeman field is greater than or equal to about half of the confinement-induced band gap. TS states in such wires have an approximate chiral symmetry supporting multiple near-zero energy modes at each end leading to a minigap, which can effectively vanish. We show that the problem of small minigap in such wires can be resolved by forcing the system to break the approximate chirality symmetry externally with a second Zeeman field. Although experimental signatures such as zero-bias peak from the wire ends is suppressed by the second Zeeman field above a critical value, such a field is required in some important parameter regimes of quasi-1D wires to isolate the topological physics of end-state MFs. We also discuss the crucial difference of our minigap calculations from the previously reported minigap results appropriate for idealized spinless p-wave superconductors and explain why the clustering of fermionic subgap states around the zero-energy Majorana end state with increasing chemical potential seen in the latter system does not apply to the experimental TS states in spin-orbit-coupled nanowires.									39	0	0	0	0	39			1098-0121			WOS:000306088700010

Microcosms were designed with four environmental matrices in order to determine the contribution of each environmental compartment to changes in toxicity: water only (14 water + sediment (WS), water + plants (WP), and water + plants + sediment (WPS). Silver treatments included AgNPs with two different coatings, gum arabic (GA-AgNPs) or polyvinylpyrollidone (PVP-AgNPs), as well as AgNO3. Water samples taken from the microcosms at 24 h postdosing were used in acute toxicity tests with two standard model organisms, early life stage zebrafish (Danio rerio) and Daphnia magna. Speciation of Ag in these samples was analyzed using Ag L3-edge X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES). Silver speciation patterns for the nanoparticle treatments varied significantly by coating type. While PVP-AgNPs were quite stable and resisted transformation matrices (>92.4% Ag(0)), GA-AgNP speciation patterns suggest significantly higher transformation rates, especially in treatments with plants (<69.2% and <58.8% Ag(0) in WP and VVPS, respectively) and moderately increased transformation with sediments (<85.6% Ag(0)). Additionally, the presence of plants in the microcosms (with and without sediments) reduced both the concentration of Ag in the water column and toxicity for all Ag treatments. Reductions in toxicity may have been related to decreased water column concentrations as well as changes in the surface chemistry of the particles induced by organic substances released from the plants.									62	2	0	54	0	63			0013-936X			WOS:000305876500005	22680837

A United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) standard method (OPPTS 835.1110) for estimating soluble pollutant removal during wastewater treatment using freeze-dried, heat-treated (FDH) activated sludge (AS) has been recently proposed for predicting ENM fate in WWTPs. This study is the first to evaluate the use of FDH AS in batch experiments for quantifying ENM removal from wastewater. While soluble pollutants sorbed equally to fresh and FDH AS, fullerene, silver, gold, and polystyrene nanoparticles' removals with FDH AS were approximately 60-100% less than their removals with fresh AS. Unlike fresh AS, FDH AS had a high concentration of proteins and other soluble organics in the liquid phase, disintegration due to freeze-drying and heat exposure. This cellular matter stabilized ENMs such that they were poorly removed by FDH AS. Therefore, FDH AS is not a suitable sorbent for estimating nanoparticle removal in WWTPs, whereas fresh AS has been shown to reasonably predict full-scale performance for titanium removal. This study indicates that natural or engineered processes (e.g., anaerobic digestion, biosolids decomposition in soils) that result in cellular degradation and matrices rich in surfactant-like materials (natural organic matter, proteins, phospholipids, etc.) may transform nanoparticle surfaces and significantly alter their fate in the environment.									40	2	0	30	0	43			0013-936X			WOS:000305876500019	22320890

Using various beamsplitting techniques, MMM splits the near-infrared laser beam into multiple beamlets and produces a multifocal array on the sample for parallel multiphoton excitation and then records fluorescence signal from all foci simultaneously with an area array detector, which significantly improves the imaging speed of multiphoton microscopy and allows for high efficiency in use of the excitation light. In this paper, we discuss the features of several MMM setups using different beamsplitting devices, including a Nipkow spinning disk, a microlens array, a set of beamsplitting mirrors, or a diffractive optical element (DOE). In particular, we present our recent work on the development of an MMM using a spatial light modulator (SLM).									14	1	0	5	0	14			1793-5458			WOS:000315591700007

The seismic performance of these masonry domes is simulated with nonlinear finite-element (FE) models. To support the assumptions and decisions established during the development of the FE models, the vibration response of the domes is measured on-site and systematically compared against the numerical model predictions. Linear FE models are developed that are in close agreement with the measured natural frequencies and in visual agreement with the measured mode shapes. Next, these linear models are extended into the nonlinear range by incorporating the Drucker-Prager damage criterion. Finally, nonlinear FE models are used to assess the performance of these two domes under seismic loadings obtained from the 1940 El Centro earthquake acceleration records. The predicted displacements and internal tensile stress levels are used to make inferences about the potential behavior of these two buildings under the selected earthquake load.

At 10 K, the nanocomposites exhibited four emission peaks at 3.108, 2.929, 2.730, and 2.248 eV, which correspond to the DX, AX, DX-1LO, and DX-2LO phonon replicas, respectively. With an increase in temperature from 10 to 275 K, the curves in the intensities of the emission peaks formed an inverted "S" shape while their energies remained nearly constant. At 300 K, however, only the AX emission peak was observed; the DX and LO phonon replicas disappeared. The intensities of the DX and AX emission peaks exhibited anomalous behaviors.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1533-4880			WOS:000307604700156	22966687

The method is based on variation of the periodicity, the duty cycle, and the groove tilt angle of the grating. Grating design involves numerical analysis of the optical field propagated through the grating by applying the rigorous coupled wave approach method. Experimental evaluation of the designed grating components was done by fabrication and testing the broad area semiconductor lasers with the monolithically integrated grating outcouplers. We present a grating design that provides the spreading of a single optical output into multibeams at different outcoupling angles in the emitting plane. We also present an approach to provide uniform optical intensity profile from the grating outcoupler based on varying duty cycle. (C) 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

Bioretention cells (BRCs) are a pollution mitigation option that can address the new regulations. In order to implement BRCs in the landscape, models are needed so stormwater engineers and managers can estimate the impact of the mitigation technique. While several BRC models are available, users must supply input parameters, which are many times poorly understood. The objective of this work was to determine the level of input specificity in hydraulic parameters needed to accurately estimate water movement through a BRC. A water movement model was developed that incorporates infiltration, drainage, and overflow for a single storm event. Then pilot-scale BRCs were constructed and operated to obtain data for model testing. The model was run with four sets of input parameters with increasing specificity: soil type, fraction sand/silt/clay, an adjustment for bulk density, and a macropore routine to serve as a fitting parameter While the model with the highest input specificity proved to match experimental values closest (drainage volume between 0.7% and 8.8% from observed, and maximum drainage flow rate between 1.4% and 18% from observed), it is unlikely that storm water managers would have access or time to obtain this information. However, a simulation with the fraction sand/silt/clay and an adjustment for bulk density provided acceptable results (drainage volume between 0.7% and 18% from observed, and maximum drainage flow rate between 30% and 39% from observed).									0	0	0	0	0	0			2151-0032			WOS:000309089900009

A priori analysis of subgrid mass diffusion vectors in high pressure turbulent hydrogen/oxygen reacting shear layer flames								PHYSICS OF FLUIDS				24	7					075114	10.1063/1.4739065			JUL 2012	2012	Direct numerical simulations of high pressure (100 atm), turbulent H-2/O-2 non-premixed temporally developing shear layer flames are conducted at initial Reynolds numbers ranging from 850 >= Re-delta 0 >= 4500, with up to similar to 3/4 x 10(9) grid points. A real gas equation of state, real property models, detailed chemistry, and generalized diffusion models are included. The results of the simulations focus on the mass diffusion vectors and their subgrid contributions relevant to large eddy simulation of turbulent combustion. Comparisons of the actual filtered mass flux vectors with their corresponding forms evaluated with filtered primitive variables are shown through correlation coefficients, probability density functions (PDFs) of the ratios between the vector magnitudes, and PDFs of the angles between the vectors. The results show a reasonable correlation (>= 0.75) for all species and simulations when evaluated globally. However, the correlations weaken substantially in regions of large temperature subgrid scale (SGS) variance and filtered SGS scalar dissipation. Within these regions, the correlations are also shown to vary inversely with Reynolds number. Vector analysis indicates that evaluating the mass flux vector using only the filtered primitive variables accurately predicts the direction of the actual filtered flux; however, the magnitude is poorly predicted in the aforementioned regions. Comparisons of the subgrid mass fluxes to the subgrid scalar fluxes are also represented as PDFs of the ratios between the vector magnitudes. These results show the subgrid mass flux to be significantly smaller (less than or similar to 5%) than the subgrid scalar flux, and this ratio is shown to diminish with increasing Reynolds number. A final comparison of the divergence of the subgrid mass fluxes to the subgrid scalar fluxes are also represented as PDFs of the ratios between the magnitudes. At lower Reynolds numbers, these ratios suggest comparable values between the subgrid diffusion and turbulent stirring terms in regions of large temperature SGS variance and filtered SGS scalar dissipation. However, this ratio is shown to diminish, but remain significant, with increasing Reynolds number. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Sixty mature consumers participated in a laboratory experiment and completed a shopping task on a mock apparel website with or without a VSA. Results revealed that participants in the VSA (vs. no-VSA) condition perceived significantly greater social support; however, no significant difference existed in perceived technical support between the two conditions. This study also revealed that mature consumers' perceived social support and ease of use of the retail website positively influenced their attitude toward the retail website, which in turn led to their website patronage intentions. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed with respect to the potential of VSAs in enhancing the e-tail service quality for mature consumers.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0887-302X			WOS:000308028700005

J	Chastain, J. P.; Coloma-del Valle, A.; Moore, K. P.								USING BROILER LITTER AS AN ENERGY SOURCE: ENERGY CONTENT AND ASH COMPOSITION								APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE				28	4			513	522					JUL 2012	2012	Broiler farms produce large amounts of litter that is typically spread on nearby cropland or is sold to other farmers for use as a fertilizer substitute. Burning litter biomass to provide energy for space heating in broiler houses or for off-site electric generation has been viewed as an attractive alternative to land application and a source of renewable energy. A large litter sample was obtained from a commercial broiler farm following clean-out to evaluate the energy content, ash yield, and characteristics of ash following combustion. Litter ash was evaluated as a possible lime substitute and fertilizer The energy content of the broiler litter was 14,425 kJ/kg(DM) and had an ash content of 24.7% dry basis. Broiler litter ash contained large amounts of Ca and a pH of 11.6, however the calcium carbonate equivalency (CCE) was only 32.4% on a dry basis. It was determined that broiler litter ash should not be used as a liming agent since it would result in excessive application of P2O5 K2O, Cu, Zn, and Na. Small applications of litter ash, on the order of 2 t/ha or less, can provide the P or K needs of a crop and can serve as a source of key micronutrients without application of large amounts of Zn, Cu, or Na. A 1-MW litter fueled electric power plant would provide enough P2O5 in litter ash to fertilize only 1600 ha at a rate of 100 kg P2O5/ha. It was also estimated that only 59% of the electrical generating capacity would be available for use by the distribution system over and above the electricity required by the broiler houses that supply litter to the plant. The amount of litter produced on broiler farms is theoretically adequate to provide enough heat to eliminate the purchase of propane for space heating but is limited by heating system efficiency The amount of land needed to accommodate the ash from an on-farm litter furnace was estimated to be about 20 ha per broiler house. Many technical and economic obstacles need to be overcome to see large scale use of litter as a source of biomass fuel.									4	0	0	3	0	4			0883-8542			WOS:000307798700005

Merle								Field Evaluation of a Kudzu/Cottonseed Oil Formulation on the Persistence of the Beet Armyworm Nucleopolyhedrovirus								JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGICAL SCIENCE				47	3			197	207					JUL 2012	2012	A plant extract from kudzu, Pueraria lobata (Willd.) Ohwi (Fabaceae), was tested as a UV protectant for the beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), nucleopolyhedrovirus (SeMNPV), with and without the addition of an oil/emulsifier (cottonseed oil/lecithin) formulation. Aqueous and oil emulsion formulations of SeMNPV were applied to collards and the residual virus activity was determined for 7 d. Sunlight exposure of SeMNPV resulted in an activity loss of 42%, 85%, and 95% at days 2, 4, and 7, respectively. The addition of the oil/emulsifier to SeMNPV did not provide UV protection. At days 2, 4, and 7, activity losses were 67%, 84%, and 92%, respectively. Whereas the addition of kudzu (5%) to SeMNPV provided significant UV protection during the sunlight exposure period, activity losses of 17%, 62%, and 76% occurred at days 2, 4, and 7, respectively. The greatest UV protection for SeMNPV was achieved when cottonseed oil/lecithin were used in conjunction with kudzu. In this formulation, activity losses were 2%, 40%, and 55% at days 2, 4, and 7, respectively. Although the mode of action is currently unknown, the addition of cottonseed oil to kudzu resulted in an increase of both UVB (280 - 320 nm) and UVA (320 - 400 nm) absorbance.									0	0	0	1	0	1			0749-8004			WOS:000306775300001		
J	Smith, Melissa C.; Peterson, Gregory D.								Optimization of Shared High-Performance Reconfigurable Computing Resources								ACM TRANSACTIONS ON EMBEDDED COMPUTING SYSTEMS				11	2					36	10.1145/2220336.2220348			JUL 2012	2012	In the field of high-performance computing, systems harboring reconfigurable devices, such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), are gaining more widespread interest. Such systems range from super-computers with tightly coupled reconfigurable hardware to clusters with reconfigurable devices at each node. The use of these architectures for scientific computing provides an alternative for computationally demanding problems and has advantages in metrics, such as operating cost/performance and power/performance. However, performance optimization of these systems can be challenging even with knowledge of the system's characteristics. Our analytic performance model includes parameters representing the reconfigurable hardware, application load imbalance across the nodes, background user load, basic message-passing communication, and processor heterogeneity. In this article, we provide an overview of the analytical model and demonstrate its application for optimization and scheduling of high-performance reconfigurable computing (HPRC) resources. We examine cost functions for minimum runtime and other optimization problems commonly found in shared computing resources. Finally, we discuss additional scheduling issues and other potential applications of the model.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1539-9087			WOS:000307052900011

Archaeological tourism celebrates the cultural richness of a region's history and has the potential to bring local or descendant communities financial gain. But what is the role of the archaeologist in the sustainable and responsible development and maintenance of archaeological tourism? Drawing upon their own field research, the authors suggest that when tourism and archaeological sites meet, archaeologists avoid arguments about ownership and act as facilitators for frank conversations about the consequences of tourism development for all parties involved.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0160-7383			WOS:000307144100014

We find that incommensurate folding in bilayer graphene results in a shift of the second-order G' band frequency, similar to that observed in folded single-layer graphene due to fold-induced changes in the phonon/electronic energy dispersion. Importantly, we show that the contrasting Raman shifts reported for the G' band frequency in folded graphene can be rationalized by taking into account the relative strength of fold-induced electron/phonon renormalization. More interestingly, we find that curvature in scrolled graphene lifts the degeneracy of the G band and results in a splitting of the G band and the appearance of low-frequency radial breathing-like (RBLM) modes. This study highlights a variety of Raman signatures for fold-induced and curvature-induced graphene and sets the stage for further theoretical and experimental studies of these novel structures.									20	2	0	2	0	21			1936-0851			WOS:000306673800006	22738128

This was due to two factors affecting men. First, men's improving labor market prospects made them more attractive as marriage partners. Second, immigration had a dynamic effect on search costs. In the short-run, it fragmented the marriage market, making it harder to find a partner of one's preferred background. The high search costs led to less marriage and later marriage in the 1890s. In the long-run, as immigration declined, immigrants' descendants integrated with American society. This reduced search costs and increased the marriage rate. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The method interpolates between a given set of Pareto optimal outcomes. The interpolation provided by the PAINT method implies a mixed integer linear surrogate problem for the original problem which can be optimized with any interactive method to make decisions concerning the original problem. When the scalarizations of the interactive method used do not introduce nonlinearity to the problem (which is true e.g., for the synchronous NIMBUS method), the scalarizations of the surrogate problem can be optimized with available mixed integer linear solvers. Thus, the use of the interactive method is fast with the surrogate problem even though the problem is computationally expensive. Numerical examples of applying the PAINT method for interpolation are included.									17	0	0	0	0	17			0926-6003			WOS:000306836900012

This study reports biochemical properties of human endonuclease V with respect to repair of deaminated base lesions. Using soluble proteins fused to thioredoxin at the N-terminus, we determined repair activities of human endonuclease V on deoxyinosine (I)-, deoxyxanthosine (X)-, deoxyoxanosine (O)- and deoxyuridine (U)-containing DNA. Human endonuclease V is most active with deoxyinosine-containing DNA but with minor activity on deoxyxanthosine-containing DNA. Endonuclease activities on deoxyuridine and deoxyoxanosine were not detected. The endonuclease activity on deoxyinosine-containing DNA follows the order of single-stranded I > G/I > T/I > A/I > C/I. The preference of the catalytic activity correlates with the binding affinity of these deoxyinosine-containing DNAs. Mg2+ and to a much less extent, Mn2+, Ni2+, Co2+ can support the endonuclease activity. Introduction of human endonuclease V into Escherichia coli cells deficient in nfi, mug and ung genes caused three-fold reduction in mutation frequency. This is the first report of deaminated base repair activity for human endonuclease V. The relationship between the endonuclease activity and deaminated deoxyadenosine (deoxyinosine) repair is discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Stromal-epithelial interactions modulate cross-talk between prolactin receptor and HER2/Neu in breast cancer								BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT				134	1			157	169		10.1007/s10549-012-1954-3			JUL 2012	2012	Prolactin (PRL) promotes the proliferation and survival of breast cancer cells in part via the transactivation of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), also known as Neu in rodents. A PRL receptor (PRLR) antagonist, G129R, has been developed, which indirectly inhibits the tyrosine phosphorylation of HER2 (p-HER2) in human breast cancer cell lines. In this study, we investigate the effects of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) upon this molecular cross-talk using tumor cells and CAFs derived from spontaneous mammary tumors of female MMTV-neu transgenic mice. Tumors were resected and cultured as small tumor chunks (similar to 3 mm(3)) or were cultured in monolayer. G129R reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of Neu (p-Neu) in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 similar to 10 mu g/ml) in tumor chunks, but had no effect on primary tumor epithelial cells grown in monolayer. Direct co-culture of mouse or human tumor epithelial cell lines with CAFs restored the epithelial cells' response to G129R, similar to that observed in mouse tumor chunks. The addition of PRL, as expected, induced p-Neu in both the tumor chunk and co-culture models. The inhibitory effect of G129R was absent when CAFs were physically separated from mouse tumor epithelial cells using a transwell system, or when CAFs were replaced with normal fibroblasts in direct co-culture with human or mouse tumor epithelial cells. In vivo, G129R reduced p-Neu levels in primary mammary tumors of mice in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, CAFs play a critical role in bridging the cross-talk between PRL and HER2/Neu in both mouse and human models of breast cancer. The inhibitory effects of G129R on p-Neu and on tumor growth are dependent upon interactions of tumor epithelial cells with CAFs.									5	0	0	5	0	5			0167-6806			WOS:000306437500015	22270933

On one hand, it is risky to allocate all available sensing resources at a single location while ignoring other regions. On the other hand, the sensor may miss-detect or miss-classify a critical object with insufficient observations. Therefore, we develop a decision-making strategy that balances the tolerable risks and the desired decision precision under limited resources.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0018-9251	1557-9603		WOS:000306517100045

In the first experiment, whether climbing juveniles preferentially ascend water sources with conspecifics or whether the presence of just stream water is sufficient to attract fish to ascend a climbing path were assessed. In the second experiment, whether climbing juveniles create a trail of mucus that facilitates the ability of conspecifics to follow their lead was determined. The results indicate that juvenile S. stimpsoni are less likely to climb in waters devoid of organic cues but are strongly attracted to stream water with or without the odour of conspecifics. Once climbing, performance did not differ for juveniles climbing in differing water choices, suggesting an all-or-nothing commitment once climbing commences. Climbing S. stimpsoni did produce a mucous trail while climbing that was associated with a mucous gland that dramatically increases in size just prior to juveniles gaining the ability to climb. The trail was not followed closely by subsequent juveniles traversing the same channel, however, suggesting only weak trail-following in waterfall climbing S. stimpsoni. Previous genetic studies suggest that juvenile S. stimpsoni do not home to natal streams in the face of strong near-shore oceanic currents. Instead, these fish appear primarily to rely on cues that suggest the presence of organic growth in streams, a factor that may indicate suitable habitat in an ever-changing stream environment but which may also be vulnerable to interference through human activity.									8	0	0	6	0	8			0022-1112			WOS:000306473000028	22803741

Domesticated livestock comprise a unique population for the analysis of mammary gland and lactation biology, where much of what has been learned about these topics originates from studies of these species. However, with the strong trend toward using rodents as flexible and attractive models for normal mammary biology and cancer, there is a growing void of new information related to biology of the mammary glands in these relevant and informative domestic livestock. In turn, this trend threatens to reduce opportunities to either capitalize on an abundance of pre-existing data or to apply this information to studies of lactation and cancer. Herein we review the unique and discerning features of mammary gland development in several domestic livestock species including cows, sheep and pigs and provide an overview of the factors regulating it. At the same time we discuss some of the key considerations for studying these species, their limitations, and the associated opportunities. From such an analysis it quickly becomes clear that much remains to be learned about the mammary glands of domestic livestock, particularly given their many similarities to the human breast, the unique biological mechanisms they employ, and the phenotypic variation they afford.

Merr.] golf green to reduced light environments (RLE) treated with trinexapac-ethyl (TE) at 0 and 0.013 kg ha(-1) wk(-1). Three levels of RLE, 0, 60, and 90%, were imposed to coincide with maximum seasonal growth of zoysiagrass. Plant growth measurements included turf quality (TQ), chlorophyll concentration, clipping yield, and total nonstructural carbohydrates. Zoysiagrass grown in full sunlight and 60% RLE maintained commercially acceptable TQ (>= 7) with and without TE throughout Year 1 while 90% RLE treatments fell below an acceptable level 2 mo aft er study initiation. Sixty percent RLE treatments without TE demonstrated unacceptable TQ during Year 2. Application of TE sustained turf viability in 90% RLE through Year 2. Clipping yield increased in 60% RLE without TE compared to full sunlight treatments. Application of TE to 60% RLE treatments reduced clipping yield 30 to 76% in Year 1. Chlorophyll concentration in 60% RLE treatments was similar 10 wk aft er RLE implementation compared to full sunlight treatments in Year 1 and higher in Year 2. Total nonstructural carbohydrate concentration of roots, rhizomes, and stolons was similar in full sun and 60% RLE treatments at the end of both years and between 47 and 100% lower in 90% RLE treatments compared to full sun treatments. These results support the use of Diamond zoysiagrass in up to 60% reduced light putting green environments with concurrent use of a gibberellin biosynthesis inhibiting product such as TE.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0002-1962			WOS:000305957800001

This study evaluated the influence of starter culture, whey solids and composition, and spray drying on bleaching efficacy. Cheddar cheese whey with annatto was manufactured with starter culture or by addition of lactic acid and rennet. Pasteurized fat-separated whey was ultrafiltered (retentate) and spray dried to 34% whey protein concentrate (WPC34). Aliquots were bleached at 60 degrees C for 1 h (hydrogen peroxide, 250 ppm), before pasteurization, after pasteurization, after storage at 3 degrees C and after freezing at -20 degrees C. Aliquots of retentate were bleached analogously immediately and after storage at 3 or -20 degrees C. Freshly spray dried WPC34 was rehydrated to 9% (w/w) solids and bleached. In a final experiment, pasteurized fat-separated whey was ultrafiltered and spray dried to WPC34 and WPC80. The WPC34 and WPC80 retentates were diluted to 7 or 9% solids (w/w) and bleached at 50 degrees C for 1 h. Freshly spray-dried WPC34 and WPC80 were rehydrated to 9 or 12% solids and bleached. Bleaching efficacy was measured by extraction and quantification of norbixin. Each experiment was replicated 3 times. Starter culture, fat separation, or pasteurization did not impact bleaching efficacy (P > 0.05) while cold or frozen storage decreased bleaching efficacy (P < 0.05). Bleaching efficacy of 80% (w/w) protein liquid retentate was higher than liquid whey or 34% (w/w) protein liquid retentate (P < 0.05). Processing steps, particularly holding times and solids composition, influence bleaching efficacy of whey. Practical Application: Optimization of whey bleaching conditions is important to reduce the negative effects of bleaching on the flavor of dried whey ingredients. This study established that liquid storage and whey composition are critical processing points that influence bleaching efficacy.									4	0	0	4	0	4			0022-1147			WOS:000305975700033	22757701

Bacterial Diversity in Dried Colostrum and Whey Sold as Nutraceutical Products								JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE				77	7			M359	M363		10.1111/j.1750-3841.2012.02771.x			JUL 2012	2012	The microbial communities were analyzed from commercially available dried dairy nutraceutical products, including 4 brands of dried colostrum, 2 brands of dried whey, and 1 brand of nonfat dry milk. A culture-dependent 16S rRNA sequencing approach was utilized to elucidate the identity of individual isolates recovered from each dried dairy product. Approximately 69% of all bacterial isolates were members the genus of Bacillus, while approximately 14% of all bacterial isolates were identified as members of the genus Pseudomonas. Members of the Kocuria, Microbacterium, and Enterococcus genera were identified as well. Practical Application: This project investigated the microbial populations inherent in dried commercially available nutraceutical products. Bovine colostrum has been reported to have protective activity against certain viral and bacterial pathogens. This project was designed to identify the bacterial populations within dried dairy nutraceutical products to determine if any species were common to all products and which may impact the reported nutraceutical properties.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0022-1147			WOS:000305975700015	22708784

The structural and the optical properties of the porous ZnO nanorods were investigated using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and temperature-dependent photoluminescence. The average diameter and density of the nanosized pores were 32 nm and 7 x 10(10) cm(-2), respectively. The crystal quality, stoichiometry, and optical properties of the porous ZnO nanorods were enhanced in comparison with those of the as-prepared ZnO nanorods. The activation energies for the exciton with increasing temperature in the as-prepared and the porous ZnO nanorods were 27.0 and 37.8 meV, respectively. At temperatures of 50 K < T < 125 K, the free exciton emission peak energy of the porous ZnO nanorods exhibited an anomalous behavior. The values of the fitting parameters in Varshni's empirical formula were alpha = 1 x 10(-3) eV/K and beta = 720 K for the as-prepared ZnO nanorods and alpha = 1 x 10(-3) eV/K and beta = 710 K for the porous ZnO nanorods. With increasing temperature, the exciton radiative lifetime of the porous ZnO nanorods exhibited an inverted S-shape while that of the as-prepared ZnO nanorods increased linearly.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0374-4884			WOS:000306287100019

Ultrafast, large-field multiphoton microscopy based on an acousto-optic deflector and a spatial light modulator								OPTICS LETTERS				37	13			2532	2534					JUL 1 2012	2012	We present an ultrafast, large-field multiphoton excitation fluorescence microscope with high lateral and axial resolutions based on a two-dimensional (2-D) acousto-optical deflector (AOD) scanner and spatial light modulator (SLM). When a phase-only SLM is used to shape the near-infrared light from a mode-locked titanium: sapphire laser into a multifocus array including the 0-order beam, a 136 mu m x 136 mu m field of view is achieved with a 60x objective using a 2-D AOD scanner without any mechanical scan element. The two-photon fluorescence image of a neuronal network that was obtained using this system demonstrates that our microscopy permits observation of dynamic biological events in a large field with high-temporal and -spatial resolution.

Twelve storage approaches were investigated to determine their effects on instability of propiconazole resistance for three demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicide-resistant and two DMI-sensitive isolates of Monilinia fructicola. They included mycelium in PDA slants under mineral oil, in PDA plugs under 10% glycerol, on dried filter paper and conidia on silica gel, each stored for 36 weeks at 4, - 20, and - 80 degrees C. RESULTS: None of the storage approaches prevented the rapid decline of EC50 values for propiconazole in the three resistant isolates, and no significant differences were found among storage approaches (P = 0.787) or between storage approaches and consecutive transfers (P = 0.053). Most of the decline in resistance occurred during the first 4 weeks of storage. The DMI resistance-associated genetic element Mona, located in the immediate upstream region of the MfCYP51 gene, was still present in the three resistant isolates after 36 weeks of storage and weekly transfers. Furthermore, the Mona element and a portion of the MfCYP51 gene, which encodes the target enzyme for DMIs, did not reveal signs of DNA methylation. Resistance to propiconazole was partially regained in resistant isolates after two growth cycles on fresh peach fruit. CONCLUSIONS: Obtained data indicate that the decline of DMI resistance in M. fructicola cannot be prevented using commonly employed storage methods at various temperatures. The number of consecutive transfers and the storage duration prior to fungicide sensitivity tests in M. fructicola should be indicated in scientific papers.

In order to reduce the photodegradation of pesticides, and so increase their killing activity against target pests, chitosan-coated beeswax solid lipid nanoparticles (CH-BSLNs) were prepared by a combination of hot homogenization and sonication, with deltamethrin as an active ingredient. RESULTS: Under optimal conditions, the highest encapsulation efficiency (95%) and a high payload of deltamethrin (approximately 12.5%) were achieved. In direct photolysis, in the case of CH-BSLNs after UV irradiation for 24 h, 37.3% of deltamethrin remained, as opposed to only 14.6% of the free-form deltamethrin. In addition, in indirect photolysis, in the case of CH-BSLNs after UV irradiation for 2 h in 2% acetone solution, approximately 74.5% of deltamethrin remained, as opposed to only 37.6% of the free-form deltamethrin. CONCLUSION: CH-BSLNs showed good protection for deltamethrin against photodegradation. This novel nanocarrier may be useful in crop protection as an economical strategy to enhance the effect of pesticides in the field and protect the environment as well.

Effectiveness of potassium carbonate sesquihydrate to increase dietary cation-anion difference in early lactation cows								JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE				95	7			3919	3925		10.3168/jds.2011-4840			JUL 2012	2012	The effect of additional dietary potassium in early lactation dairy cows was evaluated with the addition of potassium carbonate sesquihydrate, which increased dietary K from 1.3 to 2.1% of dry matter (DM) from wk 3 to 12 of lactation. Cows fed potassium carbonate sesquihydrate in the form of DCAD Plus (Church & Dwight Co. Inc., Princeton, NJ) had increased DM intake, milk fat percentage and yield, energy-corrected milk, and efficiency of milk production per unit of DM intake. Milk fat of cows fed higher dietary K had a lower concentration of trans fatty acids, suggesting a role for potassium carbonate sesquihydrate in the rumen in the biohydrogenation processes converting linoleic to stearic acid. Cows fed the diet with 2.1% K had greater apparent balance of K, and no effects were noted on the concentration of blood Mg or amount of fecal Mg. The data support the feeding of greater amounts of K in the early lactation cow.									6	0	0	6	0	6			0022-0302			WOS:000305363100040	22720946

While the crushing responses in terms of energy absorption and densification strains have been extensively researched and reported, a gap is identified in the generalization of honeycombs with contr'olled and varying geometric parameters. This paper addresses this gap through a series of finite element (FE) simulations where the cell angle and the inclined wall thickness, are varied while maintaining a constant mass of the honeycomb structure. A randomly filled, nonrepeating design of experiments (DOEs) is generated to determine the effects of these geometric parameters on the output of energy absorbed and a statistical sensitivity analysis is used to determine the parameters significant for the crushing energy absorption of honeycombs. It is found that while an increase in the inclined wall thickness enhances the energy absorption of the structure, increases in either the cell angle or ratio of cell angle to inclined wall thickness have adverse effects on the output. Finally, the optimization results suggest that a cellular geometry with a positive cell angle and a high inclined wall thickness provides for maximum energy absorption, which is verified with a 6% error when compared to a FE simulation.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1050-0472			WOS:000305794800005

Its effects on fluid and ionic species transport in capillary and microchip electrophoresis have been well studied. However, JH effects on the electrokinetic motion of microparticles in microchannels have been nearly unexplored in the literature. This paper presents an experimental investigation of JH effects on electrokinetic particle transport and manipulation in constriction microchannels under both pure dc and dc-biased ac electric fields. It is found that the JH effects reduce the dielectrophoretic focusing and trapping of particles, especially significant when dc-biased ac electric fields are used. These results are expected to provide a useful guidance for future designs of electrokinetic particle handling microdevices that will avoid JH effects or take advantage of them.									12	0	0	7	0	12			0960-1317			WOS:000305890600025

Physiological relationships of the early posthatch performance of broilers to their embryo and eggshell characteristics								POULTRY SCIENCE				91	7			1552	1557		10.3382/ps.2011-02065			JUL 2012	2012	Relationships between physiological parameters of early posthatch chicks with their corresponding egg and embryo parameters were examined in progeny of young broiler breeders. Four hundred and 80 broiler hatching eggs that were obtained from a 29-wk-old Ross 308 breeder flock were incubated on 8 replicate tray levels of an incubator until hatch. Between 10.5 and 18.5 d of incubation, internal (T-emb) and external (T-ext) egg temperatures were recorded twice daily using temperature transponders. Beginning at 18.5 d, the eggs were individually monitored for hatch every 12 h. Average T-emb, T-ext, and average daily incubational egg weight loss (EWL) for the 10.5- to 18.5-d incubation period were used to calculate eggshell water vapor conductance (G(H2O)), specific G(H2O) (g(H2O); G(H2O) 90; adjusted to 100 g of set egg weight basis), and a G(H2O) constant (K-H2O) for each egg. Chicks were grown out for 10 d in pens of a single battery brooder. In each pen, on d 3 posthatch, carcasses, yolk sac; liver, and pipping muscle samples were collected from at least 2 chicks that hatched from eggs implanted with transponders for determination of their relative weights and moisture concentrations. Livers and pipping muscles were also analyzed for glucose, glycogen, fat, and protein concentrations. Yolk sac weight as a percentage of chick BW (YW) and its moisture concentration (YSM) were positively correlated with Tenth. Egg g(H2O) was positively correlated with chick carcass moisture concentration and its relative weight as a percentage of set egg weight, but it was negatively correlated with YW. The positive functional relationship between Temb and incubation length may be mediated via their common positive relationships to YSM. A negative correlation was observed between percentage EWL and relative BW on d 0 and 0.5 posthatch for chicks hatched from unimplanted eggs. The results suggest that a higher g(H2O) results in an increased metabolism of the broiler embryo, which subsequently increases growth and yolk sac absorption in broiler chicks through 3 d posthatch.									7	0	0	6	0	7			0032-5791	1525-3171		WOS:000305590200007	22700498

The results of a study of 172 public e-commerce investment announcements show that resolution of external (exogenous) and internal (endogenous) uncertainty has a significant effect on option exercise decisions. However, the results also imply that simply waiting without investment in active learning does not create significant value from real options. The key differentiator is how a firm resolves endogenous uncertainty as this endows it with the ability to successfully undertake the information technology investment and exploit the economic opportunity implied by the resolution of exogenous uncertainty. Furthermore, our results imply that different options should be used to manage situations involving certainty of loss on one hand and severity of loss on the other hand. Thus, it is important for firms to make the right choices when using options-based investing to manage risk. We suggest that, perhaps, managers need to maintain a portfolio of options to manage the two dimensions of risk simultaneously.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1350-1917	1365-2575		WOS:000305241600002

Specifically, using a sample of 156 sales organizations, we review how sales force structure, eLearning, and technological tools can influence coordination and the level of customer orientation within an organization. While current literature touts the benefits of an outside sales force, our results suggest that this type of structure, when coupled with eLearning and technological tools, leads to even greater positive outcomes of an outside sales force. By utilizing different forms of technology in conjunction with an outside sales force, this research offers a new dynamic technological environment to further improve salesperson performance.

Fiber-Level Modeling of Dynamic Strength of Kevlar (R) KM2 Ballistic Fabric								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				21	7			1107	1119		10.1007/s11665-011-0006-1			JUL 2012	2012	In recent years, modeling of the high-performance ballistic fabric has gradually shifted from the continuum and yarn length scales to the sub-yarn length scale which enabled establishment of the relationships between the fabric penetration resistance and various fiber-level phenomena such as fiber-fiber friction, fiber twist, transverse properties of the fibers, and the stochastic nature of fiber strength. In general, these sub-yarn modeling schemes involve special numerical techniques (e. g., digital-element method) and customized computational codes. This status of the sub-yarn fabric-modeling methods and tools makes them not readily available to wider academic and industrial research communities. In the present work, an attempt is made to use conventional finite-element methods and tools in order to carry out sub-yarn numerical analysis of the penetration resistance of Kevlar (R) KM2 ballistic fabric. The goal was to demonstrate that results could be obtained which are comparable to their digital-element method = based counterparts. Specifically, a series of transient nonlinear dynamics finite-element analyses was carried out in order to investigate the role of the following two important sub-yarn phenomena on the penetration resistance of Kevlar (R) KM2 fabric: (a) fiber transverse properties including nonlinear elastic and plastic response and (b) fiber-fiber friction within the context of stochastically distributed fiber axial strength. It is generally found that the results obtained are consistent with their digital-element method-based counterparts.									12	0	0	0	0	12			1059-9495			WOS:000305522800001

An important innovation was the escapement mechanism, which converts stored energy into oscillatory motion for fixed time intervals through the pendulum swing. Previous work has modeled the escapement mechanism in terms of inelastic and elastic collisions. We derive and experimentally verify a theoretical model in terms of impulsive differential equations for the Graham escapement mechanism in a Seth Thomas tower clock. The model offers insight into the clock's mechanical behavior and the functionality of the deadbeat escapement mechanism. (C) 2012 American Association of Physics Teachers.

Small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) can be covalently and reversibly conjugated to the sumoylation sites of target proteins, many of which are implicated in various human genetic disorders. The accurate prediction of protein sumoylation sites may help biomedical researchers to design their experiments and understand the molecular mechanism of protein sumoylation. In this study, a new machine learning approach has been developed for predicting sumoylation sites from protein sequence information. Random forests (RFs) and support vector machines (SVMs) were trained with the data collected from the literature. Domain-specific knowledge in terms of relevant biological features was used for input vector encoding. It was shown that RF classifier performance was affected by the sequence context of sumoylation sites, and 20 residues with the core motif Psi KXE in the middle appeared to provide enough context information for sumoylation site prediction. The RF classifiers were also found to outperform SVM models for predicting protein sumoylation sites from sequence features. The results suggest that the machine learning approach gives rise to more accurate prediction of protein sumoylation sites than the other existing methods. The accurate classifiers have been used to develop a new web server, called seeSUMO (http://bioinfo.ggc.org/seesumo/), for sequence-based prediction of protein sumoylation sites.

Azimuthal distribution scans showed the evolution of crystalline orientation in the bubble from an isotropic state to an oriented state as inferred from (110) and (200) planes. These real-time X-ray diffraction measurements in a blown film line are consistent with prior observations using polarized Raman spectroscopy (Gururajan and Ogale, J.

Comparative evaluation of air cell and eggshell temperature measurement methodologies used in broiler hatching eggs during late incubation								POULTRY SCIENCE				91	7			1536	1541		10.3382/ps.2011-01978			JUL 2012	2012	The current study was conducted to compare and contrast the uses of 2 devices (temperature transponder or infrared thermometer) and their locations (inner air cell membrane or outer eggshell surface) in Ross x Ross 708 broiler hatching eggs. The air cells of 14 embryonated and 10 nonembryonated eggs were implanted with temperature transponders on d 13.5 of incubation. Likewise, for these same eggs, eggshell surface temperature was detected with the use of transponders and an infrared thermometer. Temperatures were recorded every 12 h between 14.5 and 18 d of incubation, and graphs and corresponding regression values were used to track the temperatures over these time periods. The temperature readings using all methods in embryonated and nonembryonated eggs were positively correlated. In nonembryonated eggs, temperatures in the air cell and on the eggshell surface using transponders were higher than those on the eggshell surface using an infrared thermometer. Mean air cell temperature readings of embryonated eggs using transponders were higher than those of the eggshell, as determined with the use of transponders or an infrared thermometer. Furthermore, the differences in air cell temperature using transponders and eggshell temperature using an infrared thermometer in embryonated eggs increased with embryonic age. These readings confirmed increased embryo heat production during the incubational period examined. It was further concluded that when compared with actual embryo body temperatures determined in previous studies, the use of transponders in the air cells of broiler hatching eggs detected a higher and closer temperature than eggshell surface temperature. It is suggested that the air cell transponders in embryonated eggs circumvented the confounding effects of the thermal barrier properties of the eggshell and the flow of air across its surface.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0032-5791			WOS:000305590200005	22700496

However, the current conclusions on the protective effect of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were obtained by analyzing the overall amount of protein and factor secretion in a conventional co-culture system. These results neglected the heterogeneity of MSC population and failed to determine the importance of cellular contact to the protective effects. To address these issues, we have constructed two biochips by microfabrication methods and laser-guided cell micropatterning technique. Using the biochips, the protective effect of MSCs on CMCs can be quantitatively analyzed at single-cell level with defined cellular contact. The role of cellular contact on protective effect can be clarified according to our statistical results.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0141-5492			WOS:000305210900028	22426842

JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION				89	7			850	853		10.1021/ed200394d			JUL 2012	2012	The use of the curved-arrow notation to depict electron flow during mechanistic processes is one of the most important representational conventions in the organic chemistry curriculum. Our previous research documented a disturbing trend: when asked to predict the products of a series of reactions, many students do not spontaneously engage in mechanism use even when explicitly prompted to do so. Building upon those results, this study revealed that students who engaged in mechanism use were better equipped to solve organic chemistry problems but only those that involve transfer of knowledge.									11	0	0	0	0	11			0021-9584			WOS:000305308600007		
J	Foster, Kathleen L.; Higham, Timothy E.								How forelimb and hindlimb function changes with incline and perch diameter in the green anole, Anolis carolinensis								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY				215	13			2288	2300		10.1242/jeb.069856			JUL 2012	2012	The range of inclines and perch diameters in arboreal habitats poses a number of functional challenges for locomotion. To effectively overcome these challenges, arboreal lizards execute complex locomotor behaviors involving both the forelimbs and the hindlimbs. However, few studies have examined the role of forelimbs in lizard locomotion. To characterize how the forelimbs and hindlimbs differentially respond to changes in substrate diameter and incline, we obtained three-dimensional high-speed video of green anoles (Anolis carolinensis) running on flat (9 cm wide) and narrow (1.3 cm) perches inclined at 0, 45 and 90 deg. Changes in perch diameter had a greater effect on kinematics than changes in incline, and proximal limb variables were primarily responsible for these kinematic changes. In addition, a number of joint angles exhibited greater excursions on the 45 deg incline compared with the other inclines. Anolis carolinensis adopted strategies to maintain stability similar to those of other arboreal vertebrates, increasing limb flexion, stride frequency and duty factor. However, the humerus and femur exhibited several opposite kinematic trends with changes in perch diameter. Further, the humerus exhibited a greater range of motion than the femur. A combination of anatomy and behavior resulted in differential kinematics between the forelimb and the hindlimb, and also a potential shift in the propulsive mechanism with changes in external demand. This suggests that a better understanding of single limb function comes from an assessment of both forelimbs and hindlimbs. Characterizing forelimb and hindlimb movements may reveal interesting functional differences between Anolis ecomorphs. Investigations into the physiological mechanisms underlying the functional differences between the forelimb and the hindlimb are needed to fully understand how arboreal animals move in complex habitats.									25	2	0	22	0	25			0022-0949			WOS:000305090600023	22675190

Remobilization of Co-60, Sr-85, Cs-137, Eu-152, and Am-241 from a Contaminated Soil Column by Groundwater and Organic Ligands								TRANSPORT IN POROUS MEDIA				93	3			799	813		10.1007/s11242-012-9983-2			JUL 2012	2012	The desorption rate of Co-60, Sr-85, Cs-137, Eu-152, and Am-241 from soil collected from Inshas disposal site in Egypt was investigated to understand the desorption and mobility of these radionuclides in the environment. Effect of a synthetic groundwater (GW) and the GW amended to 2 x 10(-5)M of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or ethylenediaminediacetic acid (EDDA), GW+ETDA and GW+EDDA, respectively, was studied in flow-through experiments. These experiments were designed to compare the influence of EDTA relative to one of its degradation products that can exist in natural water, EDDA. First-order desorption and two-site first-order desorption equations were used to describe the time-dependent desorption data. The desorption rate for Sr-85 and Cs-137 was high in the first 50 h followed by a slow release suggesting that two different mechanisms involved. The trace metal removal was not completely reversible for all radionuclides tracers except for Sr-85. The quantity of Sr-85, Cs-137, Eu-152, and Am-241 desorbed from soil follows the order GW+EDTA > GW+EDDA > GW, while Co-60 gives unexpected trends where the effect of EDDA is twice as high as that of EDTA. This behavior was discussed based on the aqueous species distribution of Co-60 in both aqueous solutions.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0169-3913			WOS:000305225500026

International journal of yoga				5	2			151	6		10.4103/0973-6131.98244			2012-Jul	2012	BACKGROUND: Individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID) have an increased risk of obesity and are significantly less likely to engage in physical activity compared to their nondisabled peers. A growing body of research supports the physical and mental health benefits of yoga. While the benefits of yoga have been studied across a host of populations with varying ages and physical disabilities, no studies could be identified investigating the benefits of yoga for young adults with ID.AIMS: This study investigated the impact of participating in yoga classes on the amount of exercise behavior and perception of physical exertion when compared to non-structured exercise sessions between two young adults with ID in a post-secondary education setting.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single subject multiple baseline research design was implemented across two young adults with mild ID to determine the effects of a yoga exercise class on frequency of exercise behavior and perception of physical exertion when compared to non-structured exercise sessions. Partial interval recording, the Eston-Parfitt curvilinear rating of perceived exertion scale, and the physical activity enjoyment scale were implemented to collect data on dependent variables and consumer satisfaction during each non-structured exercise session and each yoga class.RESULTS: indicated that percentage of exercise behavior and perceived exertion levels during yoga group exercise sharply increased with large effect sizes when compared to non-structured exercise sessions.									0	0	0	0	0	0				2231-2714		MEDLINE:22870001	22870001

The type of plate used and the way it is processed affect the trace resolution and ink transfer of the conductive material. The authors have recently completed one of, if not the largest research studies ever conducted in printed electronics. Over 45,000 resistances were measured and nearly 1000 three-dimensional optical profiles were obtained, from which a variety of morphological parameters were measured. Many printing variables were examined, including plate material, imaging and plate processing conditions, trace orientation, anilox cell volume, plate type, line and gap width, and orientation. Aqueous, nano-silver inks were printed on both PET and coated paper. The impact of these printing process variables on the conductivity and resulting printed trace width and minimum reverse will be discussed.

J	Mellott, Mark; Thatcher, Jason; Roberts, Nicholas; Carter, Michelle								An Examination of the Role of Military Medical Chief Information Officer								MILITARY MEDICINE				177	7			850	855					JUL 2012	2012	Although research has described the roles, responsibilities, and skills of effective chief information officers (CIOs) in for-profit organizations, little is known regarding the traits and skills that characterize effective military medical CIOs. This study identifies skills a military medical CIO needs to act as a technology strategist who can successfully identify information technology (IT) innovations and convert those innovations into organizational health IT solutions. We assessed the level of necessary informational, decisional, and interpersonal skills in a cross-sectional survey of 48 military medical CIOs. We also compared military medical CIO characteristics to general CIO characteristics. Our results show that both decisional and interpersonal skills are strongly related to informational skills necessary to convert innovations into organizational IT solutions. Further, decisional skills are strongly related to a CIO's ability to act as a technology strategist. Our study provides implications for research and practice.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0026-4075	1930-613X		WOS:000209026800015	22808894

Transplantation strategies face many difficulties including low viability, lack of control of stem-cell fate, and low levels of cell engraftment after transplantation. An alternative strategy for CNS repair without transplantation is using endogenous neural stem cells (NSCs) and precursor cells. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a pleiotropic cytokine of mesenchymal origin, exerts a strong chemoattractive effect on stem cells. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a key regulator for stem-cell proliferation, mobilization, and fate choices, is currently being characterized for endogenous NSC manipulation for brain regeneration. In this study, HGF and LIP have been loaded into hydrogels and degradable nanoparticles, respectively, for sustained, long-term, localized delivery. We examine the use of HGF-loaded hydrogels and LIF-loaded nanoparticles for manipulating migration and mobilization of human NSCs in vitro. The combination of LIF-loaded nanoparticles and HGF-loaded hydrogels significantly mobilized hNSCs and promoted their migration in vitro. Studies are in progress to evaluate endogenous NSC mobilization and migration in vivo with simultaneous, controlled delivery of LIF at the natural reservoir of endogenous NSCs and HGF at the injury or disease site for in situ tissue regeneration.

This study investigated the gelation behavior and physical properties of hydrogels formed from homogeneous and blended solutions of two acrylated poloxamines (Tetronics (R) T1107 and T904) of various molecular weights and hydrophilic/lipophilic balances relative to a PEG control. Hydrogels were formed by reverse thermal gelation at physiological temperature (T1107-containing formulations) and covalent crosslinking by Michael-type addition with dithiothreitol. All poloxamine-based hydrogels exhibited thermosensitive behavior and achieved significantly reduced swelling, increased tensile properties and increased tissue bond strength relative to the PEG hydrogel at physiological temperature. Swelling and tensile properties of all poloxamine-based hydrogels were significantly greater at 37 degrees C relative to 4 degrees C, suggesting that their improved physical properties derive from cooperative crosslinking by both noncovalent and covalent mechanisms. Poloxamine-based hydrogels were cytocompatible and underwent hydrolytic degradation over 2-5 weeks, depending on their T1107/T904 composition. In conclusion, select poloxamine-based hydrogels possess a number of properties potentially beneficial to tissue sealant applications. including a substantial increase in viscosity between room/physiological temperatures, resistance to cell adhesion and maintenance of a stable volume during equilibration.

Additionally, we present and study a numerical scheme for the model, based on an extrapolated Crank-Nicolson finite element method. We show the numerical scheme is unconditionally stable, preserves energy and cross-helicity, and optimally converges to the MHD solution. Numerical experiments are provided that verify convergence rates, and test the scheme on benchmark problems of channel flow over a step and the Orszag-Tang vortex problem. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

We tested our method on subjects sitting at a computer performing a low workload surveillance task and a high workload video game task. The proposed algorithm showed superior performance compared to the classic CUSUM method for detecting task changes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Evidence from Three Coastal Regions								JOURNAL OF TRAVEL RESEARCH				51	4			464	472		10.1177/0047287511426342			JUL 2012	2012	Tourism has been a popular development strategy based on its potential of economic impacts and job opportunities, but the quality of jobs created by tourism has received little empirical investigation. This article uses data from IMPLAN and the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics to examine the income distribution of jobs created by tourism and compares the income distribution from tourism expenditures to the income distribution in three different coastal regions with large tourism industries. To examine the distribution of income from tourism, an eight-step procedure was developed by modifying previous procedures for estimating income distribution. Study findings indicate that the jobs generated by tourism expenditures had a lower income distribution than the overall income distribution in the three regions, with the difference being most apparent in more urban areas. The various implications of the low-income distribution of the tourism industry are discussed.									10	0	0	0	0	10			0047-2875			WOS:000304886600008

The results of the EMGB, which uses structural equation modeling, indicate that desire had the strongest relationship with casino visitors' intention to gamble, followed by positive anticipated emotion, perceived behavioral control, perceptions of a responsible gambling strategy, negative anticipated emotion, and attitude. The perception of a responsible gambling strategy was also a significant predictor of both desire and behavioral intention, as casino visitors had positive perceptions of casinos that implemented responsible gambling strategies. Casino managers should consider a responsible gambling strategy as an important long-term business activity to increase casino visitor's intention to gamble.									13	0	0	0	0	13			0047-2875			WOS:000304886600012

In particular, we consider an assortment planning problem under a locational choice model for consumer choice with both vertical and horizontal differentiation. We present a combined dynamic programming/line search approach which finds an optimal solution when customer preference for the horizontal attributes are distributed according to a unimodal distribution. The dynamic program makes use of new analytical results, which show that high quality products will be distributed near the mode. This enables significant state reduction and therefore efficient solution times. Efficient computation times allow us to study the solution for a wide range of system parameters and thereby draw several managerial conclusions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The focus is specifically on overloaded lines. Contingency indicative phasor limits are investigated using current magnitude and voltage angle. These limits are applied to a rotating phasor chart. An algorithm which predicts sensitivity is applied to an off-line system in order to determine the buses that need to be monitored. An online system with available phasor measurement unit (PMU) data is used to verify the phasor chart obtained using off-line data. The chart is completed for on-line PMU data, and compared with the off-line chart for further verification. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

On the complexity of the Eulerian closed walk with precedence path constraints problem								THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE				439				16	29		10.1016/j.tcs.2012.03.014			JUN 29 2012	2012	The Eulerian closed walk problem in a digraph is a well-known polynomial-time solvable problem. In this paper, we show that if we impose the feasible solutions to fulfill some precedence constraints specified by paths of the digraph, then the problem becomes NP-complete. We also present a polynomial-time algorithm to solve this variant of the Eulerian closed walk problem when the set of paths does not contain some forbidden structure. This allows us to give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of feasible solutions in this polynomial-time solvable case.

We have previously shown that anthrax protective antigen (PA), a nonpathogenic component of anthrax toxin, is an inhibitor of angiogenesis, apparently as a result of interaction with the cell surface receptors capillary morphogenesis gene 2 (CMG2) protein and tumor endothelial marker 8 (TEM8). Hence, molecules that bind the anthrax toxin receptors may be effective to slow or halt pathological vascular growth. Here we describe development and testing of an effective homogeneous steady-state fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) high throughput screening assay designed to identify molecules that inhibit binding of PA to CMG2. Molecules identified in the screen can serve as potential lead compounds for the development of anti-angiogenic and anti-anthrax therapies. The assay to screen for inhibitors of this protein-protein interaction is sensitive and robust, with observed Z' values as high as 0.92. Preliminary screens conducted with a library of known bioactive compounds identified tannic acid and cisplatin as inhibitors of the PA-CMG2 interaction. We have confirmed that tannic acid both binds CMG2 and has anti-endothelial properties. In contrast, cisplatin appears to inhibit PA-CMG2 interaction by binding both PA and CMG2, and observed cisplatin antiangiogenic effects are not mediated by interaction with CMG2. This work represents the first reported high throughput screening assay targeting CMG2 to identify possible inhibitors of both angiogenesis and anthrax intoxication.									5	0	0	4	0	5			1932-6203			WOS:000305892100136	22768167

After being purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulphate fractionation and chromatography on diethylaminoethanol (DEAE) Sepharose and Sephacryl S-200 HR columns, the enzyme was determined by the exclusive gel chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) to have a molecular weight of approximately 87 kDa. Its optimal pH and stable pH values were within the range of 4.5 to 5 and 3.5 to 7.5, respectively while its optimal temperature was in 50 to 60 degrees C. In addition, the enzyme was strongly inhibited by Fe2+, Fe3+, Zn2+, Al3+, Mn2+, Cu2+, Ag+, Hg2+ ions and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and slightly activated by K+ and Ba2+ ions. Its K-m towards naringin was 0.27 mM and the V-max was 9805.15 U/mg. The enzyme could efficiently convert naringin to prunin with a transforming rate above 97%. These results indicate that the alpha-L-rhamnosidase separated from A. niger could be a promising candidate for its commercial application in food and pharmaceutical industries.									0	2	0	0	0	2			1996-0808			WOS:000307504500031

Reproductive Characteristics of the Turquoise Darter (Etheostoma inscriptum) in the Upper Piedmont of South Carolina								COPEIA					2			237	242		10.1643/CI-11-013			JUN 27 2012	2012	Sex ratio, fecundity, gonosomatic indices (GSI), and time of spawning were examined for the Turquoise Darter (Etheostoma inscriptum) from January through June 2009. Approximately 30 specimens per sample were captured and examined in roughly three-week intervals. Additional sex ratio data were collected on 314 specimens from 3 to 13 March 2009. Sex ratio favored females 1.8:1. Male weight and length were both found to be significantly greater than those of females. Peak GSI for males was the 2 April sample (1.1%), declining considerably by 19 June (0.4%). Peak GSI for females occurred 23 April (12.83%) followed by a decline through May, and continued to decline through June, when spawning appeared to end. Fecundity analysis showed a continuum of ova maturation during the spawning period with annual fecundity estimates ranging from 122 to 235 ova/yr. GSI and fecundity analysis together support that spawning in E. inscriptum initiates near mid April and continues until June in a series of multiple spawns. These previously unknown life history aspects of E. inscriptum are a valuable asset in management applications for the species.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0045-8511			WOS:000305928700008

Electromagnetic ferrofluid-based energy harvester								PHYSICS LETTERS A				376	32			2163	2166		10.1016/j.physleta.2012.05.033			JUN 25 2012	2012	This Letter investigates the use of ferrofluids for vibratory energy harvesting. In particular, an electromagnetic micro-power generator which utilizes the sloshing of a ferrofluid column in a seismically-excited tank is proposed to transform mechanical motions directly into electricity. Unlike traditional electromagnetic generators that implement a solid magnet, ferrofluids can easily conform to different shapes and respond to very small acceleration levels offering an untapped opportunity to design scalable energy harvesters. The feasibility of the proposed concept is demonstrated and its efficacy is discussed through several experimental studies. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, band excitation piezoresponse force microscopy (BEPFM) has been proven useful for recognition and imaging of bacteria of different types in pure water. Here, the BEPFM method is performed for the first time on physiologically relevant electrolyte media, such as Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). Distinct electromechanical responses for Micrococcus lysodeikticus (Gram-positive) and Pseudomonas fluorescens (Gram-negative) bacteria in DPBS are demonstrated. The results suggest that mechanical properties of the outer surface coating each bacterium, as well as the electrical double layer around them, are responsible for the BEPFM image formation mechanism in electrolyte media.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0957-4484	1361-6528		WOS:000305160500013	22641388

However, the molecular mechanism of synthetic lethal genetic interactions remains unclear.Results: In this study we used the clusters of short polypeptide sequences, which are typically shorter than the classically defined protein domains, to characterize the functionalities of proteins. We developed a framework to identify significant short polypeptide clusters from yeast protein sequences, and then used these short polypeptide clusters as features to predict yeast synthetic lethal genetic interactions. The short polypeptide clusters based approach provides much higher coverage for predicting yeast synthetic lethal genetic interactions. Evaluation using experimental data sets showed that the short polypeptide clusters based approach is superior to the previous protein domain based one.Conclusion: We were able to achieve higher performance in yeast synthetic lethal genetic interactions prediction using short polypeptide clusters as features. Our study suggests that the short polypeptide cluster may help better understand the functionalities of proteins.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1477-5956			WOS:000306166700004	22759581	
J	Petukh, Marharyta; Zhenirovskyy, Maxim; Li, Chuan; Li, Lin; Wang, Lin; Alexov, Emil								Predicting Nonspecific Ion Binding Using DelPhi								BIOPHYSICAL JOURNAL				102	12			2885	2893		10.1016/j.bpj.2012.05.013			JUN 20 2012	2012	Ions are an important component of the cell and affect the corresponding biological macromolecules either via direct binding or as a screening ion cloud. Although some ion binding is highly specific and frequently associated with the function of the macromolecule, other ions bind to the protein surface nonspecifically, presumably because the electrostatic attraction is strong enough to immobilize them. Here, we test such a scenario and demonstrate that experimentally identified surface-bound ions are located at a potential that facilitates binding, which indicates that the major driving force is the electrostatics. Without taking into consideration geometrical factors and structural fluctuations, we show that ions tend to be bound onto the protein surface at positions with strong potential but with polarity opposite to that of the ion. This observation is used to develop a method that uses a DelPhi-calculated potential map in conjunction with an in-house-developed clustering algorithm to predict nonspecific ion-binding sites. Although this approach distinguishes only the polarity of the ions, and not their chemical nature, it can predict nonspecific binding of positively or negatively charged ions with acceptable accuracy. One can use the predictions in the Poisson-Boltzmann approach by placing explicit ions in the predicted positions, which in turn will reduce the magnitude of the local potential and extend the limits of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. In addition, one can use this approach to place the desired number of ions before conducting molecular-dynamics simulations to neutralize the net charge of the protein, because it was shown to perform better than standard screened Coulomb canned routines, or to predict ion-binding sites in proteins. This latter is especially true for proteins that are involved in ion transport, because such ions are loosely bound and very difficult to detect experimentally.									8	0	0	4	0	8			0006-3495			WOS:000305546500023	22735539

Linkage of oxygen deficiency defects and rare earth concentrations in silica glass optical fiber probed by ultraviolet absorption and laser excitation spectroscopy								OPTICS EXPRESS				20	13			14494	14507		10.1364/OE.20.014494			JUN 18 2012	2012	Ultraviolet absorption measurements and laser excitation spectroscopy in the vicinity of 248 nm provide compelling evidence for linkages between the oxygen deficiency center (ODC) and rare earth concentrations in Yb and Er-doped glass optical fibers. Investigations of YAG-derived and solution-doped glass fibers are described. For both Yb and Er-doped fibers, the dependence of Type II ODC absorption on the rare earth number density is approximately linear, but the magnitude of the effect is greater for Yb-doped fibers. Furthermore, laser excitation spectra demonstrate unambiguously the existence of an energy transfer mechanism coupling an ODC with Yb3+. Photopumping glass fibers with a Ti:sapphire laser/optical parametric amplifier system, tunable over the 225-265 nm region, or with a KrF laser at 248.4 nm show: 1) emission features in the 200-1100 nm interval attributable only to the ODC (Type II) defect or Yb3+, and 2) the excitation spectra for ODC (II) emission at similar to 280 nm and Yb3+ fluorescence (lambda similar to 1.03 mu m) to be, within experimental uncertainty, identical. The latter demonstrates that, when irradiating Yb-doped silica fibers between similar to 240 and 255 nm, the ODC (II) defect is at least the primary precursor to Yb3+ emission. Consistent with previous reports in the literature, the data show the ODC (II) absorption spectrum to have a peak wavelength and breadth of similar to 246 nm and similar to 19 nm (FWHM). Experiments also reveal that, in the absence of Yb, incorporating either Al2O3 or Y2O3 into glass fibers has a negligible impact on the ODC concentration. Not only do the data reported here demonstrate the relationship between the ODC (II) number density and the Yb doping concentration, but they also suggest that the appearance of ODC defects in the fiber is associated with the introduction of Yb and the process by which the fiber is formed.

Cloning and expression of porcine Dicer and the impact of developmental stage and culture conditions on MicroRNA expression in porcine embryos								GENE				501	2			198	205		10.1016/j.gene.2012.03.058			JUN 15 2012	2012	MicroRNA (miRNA) is a class of small, single-stranded ribonucleic acids that regulate gene expression posttranscriptionally and are involved in somatic cell, germ cell, and embryonic development. As the enzyme responsible for producing mature miRNA, Dicer is crucial to miRNA production. Characterization of Dicer and its expression at the nucleotide level, as well as the identification of miRNA expression in reproductive tissues, have yet to be reported for the domestic pig (Sus scrora), a species important for disease modeling, biomedical research, and food production. In this study we determined the primary cDNA sequence of porcine Dicer (pDicer), confirmed its expression in porcine oocytes and early stage embryos, and evaluated the expression of specific miRNA during early embryonic development and between in vivo (IVO) and in vitro (IVF) produced embryos. Total cellular RNA (tcRNA) was isolated and subjected to end point RT-PCR, subcloning, and sequencing. The pDicer coding sequence was found to be highly conserved, and phylogenetic analysis showed that pDicer is more highly conserved to human Dicer (hDicer) than the mouse homolog. Expression of pDicer mRNA was detected in oocytes and in IVO produced blastocyst embryos. Two RT-PCR procedures were conducted to identify and quantitate miRNA expressed in metaphase II oocytes (MII) and embryos. RT-PCR array was conducted using primers designed for human miRNA, and 86 putative porcine miRNA in MII and early embryos were detected. Fewer miRNAs were detected in 8-cell (8C) embryos compared to MII and blastocysts (B) (P = 0.026 and P<0.0001, respectively). Twenty-one miRNA (of 88 examined) were differentially expressed between MlI and 8C, 8C and B, or MII and B. Transcripts targeted by the differentially expressed miRNA were enriched in gene ontology (GO) categories associated with cellular development and differentiation. Further, we evaluated the effects of IVF culture on the expression of specific miRNA at the blastocyst stage. Quantitative RT-PCR was conducted on blastocyst tcRNA isolated from individual IVO and IVF produced embryos for miR-18a, -21, and -24. Only the expression level of miR-24 differed due to culture conditions, with lower levels detected in the IVO embryos. These data show that pDicer and miRNA are present in porcine oocytes and embryos. In addition, specific miRNA levels are altered due to stage of embryonic development and, in the case of miR-24, due to culture conditions, making this miRNA a candidate for screening of embryo quality. Additional studies characterizing Dicer and miRNA expression during early embryonic development from IVO and IVF sources are required to further examine and evaluate the use of miRNA as a marker for embryo quality.

J	Gasmi, Amir; Joseph, Paul F.; Rhyne, Timothy B.; Cron, Steven M.								Development of a two-dimensional model of a compliant non-pneumatic tire								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOLIDS AND STRUCTURES				49	13			1723	1740		10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2012.03.007			JUN 15 2012	2012	An analytical model for a compliant non-pneumatic tire on frictionless, rigid ground is presented. The tire model consists of a thin flexible annular band and spokes that connect the band to a rigid hub. The annular band is modeled using curved beam theory that takes into account deformations due to bending, shearing and circumferential extension. The effect of the spokes, which are distributed continuously in the model and act as linear springs, is accounted for only in tension, which introduces a nonlinear response. The quasi-static, two-dimensional analysis focuses on how the contact patch, vertical tire stiffness and rolling resistance are affected by the stiffness properties of the band and the spokes. A Fourier series representation of the shear strain in the annular band and the complex modulus of the material were used to predict rolling resistance due to steady state rolling. From the analysis point of view, when the wheel is loaded at its hub, the following three distinct regions develop: (1) a support region where the hub hangs by the spokes from the upper part of the flexible band, (2) a free surface region where the spokes buckle and have no effect, and (3) a contact region where the flexible band is supported by the ground without the effect of the spokes. The angular bounds of these three regions are determined by the spoke angle and the contact angle, which are respectively the angle at which the spokes start to engage in tension and the angle that defines the edge of contact. Closed-form expressions of contact stress, stress-resultants and displacements at the centroids of the cross-sections of the flexible band are expressed in terms of these angles, which must be determined numerically. A thorough parametric analysis of quantities of interest for the tire is presented, which can be used to help support the optimal and rational design of compliant non-pneumatic tires. The model was validated by comparison with two computational models using the commercial finite element software ABAQUS and by experimental rolling resistance data. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Most simulation programs providing these methods enable only one set of force field parameters to be used for the entire system. Whereas this is generally suitable for single-phase systems, the molecular environment at the interface between two phases may be sufficiently different from the individual phases to require a different set of parameters to be used to accurately represent the system. Recently published simulations of peptide adsorption to material surfaces using the CHARMM force field have clearly demonstrated this issue by revealing that calculated values of adsorption free energy substantially differ from experimental results. Whereas nonbonded parameters could be adjusted to correct this problem, this cannot be done without also altering the conformational behavior of the peptide in solution, for which CHARMM has been carefully tuned. We have developed a dual-force-field approach (Dual-FF) to address this problem and implemented it in the CHARMM simulation package. This Dual-FF method provides the capability to use two separate sets of nonbonded force field parameters within the same simulation: one set to represent intraphase interactions and a separate set to represent interphase interactions. Using this approach, we show that interfacial parameters can be adjusted to correct errors in peptide adsorption free energy without altering peptide conformational behavior in solution. This program thus provides the capability to enable both intraphase and interphase molecular behavior to be accurately and efficiently modeled in the same simulation.

Through investigation of three independent variables, including electric field strength (10 to 50 kV/cm), pulse numbers (2 to 16 mu s), and liquid-solid ratio (20: 1 to 60: 1), the optimal extraction parameters for protein were obtained by one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) experiment and quadratic regression orthogonal design. The results showed that the extraction yield of protein could reach 2.788 +/- 0.014% when electric fields intensity was chosen by 10 kV/cm, pulse number was 8, and liquid-solid ratio was of 40:1. Meanwhile, PEF method was a novel and promising method to extract protein from waste beer yeast which will benefit food and agriculture industry. The article mainly focuses on the extraction of dissoluble protein from waste beer yeasts by PEF. PEF could be considered as a highly efficient and energy saving technique to extract bio-component from raw materials.									6	0	0	4	0	6			1996-0808			WOS:000307409700018

Structure of Hydrated Poly(D,L-lactic acid) Studied with X-ray Diffraction and Molecular Simulation Methods								MACROMOLECULES				45	11			4896	4906		10.1021/ma3004778			JUN 12 2012	2012	The effect of hydration on the molecular structure of amorphous poly(D,L-lactic acid) (PDLLA) with 50:50 L-to-D ratio has been studied by combining experiments with molecular simulations. X-ray diffraction measurements revealed significant changes upon hydration in the structure functions of the copolymer. Large changes in the structure functions at similar to 10 days of incubation coincided with the large increase in the water uptake from similar to 1 to similar to 40% and the formation of voids in the film. Computer modeling based on the recently developed TIGER2/TIGER3 mixed sampling scheme was used to interpret these changes by efficiently equilibrating both dry and hydrated models of PDLLA. Realistic models of bulk amorphous PDLLA structure were generated as demonstrated by close agreement between the calculated and the experimental structure functions. These molecular simulations were used to identify the interactions between water and the polymer at the atomic level including the change of positional order between atoms in the polymer due to hydration. Changes in the partial O-O structure functions, about 95% of which were due to water polymer interactions, were apparent in the radial distribution functions. These changes, and somewhat smaller changes in the C-C and C-O partial structure functions, clearly demonstrated the ability of the model to capture the hydrogen-bonding interactions between water and the polymer, with the probability of water forming hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl oxygen of the ester group being about 4 times higher than with its ether oxygen.									5	0	0	1	0	5			0024-9297			WOS:000305092200055	22707795

The EPB zonal drift velocities are estimated utilizing images of the O I 630.0 nm emissions recorded by a wide-angle imaging system at Cajazeiras. Thermospheric neutral wind estimates are based upon common volume observations made by a bistatic Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) experiment using FPIs located at Cajazeiras and Cariri in Brazil observing the Doppler shift of the O I 630.0 nm emission. The results illustrate a similar pattern of nighttime and night-to-night variations in the zonal neutral winds and EPB zonal drift velocities. In general, the geomagnetic zonal neutral winds and the EPB velocities show an excellent agreement illustrating that the F region dynamo is fully developed. However, in the early evening hours the EPB zonal speed is slower than that of the background winds on several occasions. We conclude that this indicates that during the bubble evolution period in the early evening the F region dynamo is not fully activated.									14	0	0	0	0	14			0148-0227			WOS:000305147300007		
J	Byun, Youngjae; Whiteside, Scott; Thomas, Ron; Dharman, Mahalaxmi; Hughes, Jeremy; Kim, Young Teck								The effect of solvent mixture on the properties of solvent cast polylactic acid (PLA) film								JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE				124	5			3577	3582		10.1002/app.34071			JUN 5 2012	2012	The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of various solvents on the crystallinity and thermal expansion stability of PLA film. Three different PLA films were produced by the solvent casting technique; PLA in chloroform (PLA-C), PLA in methylene chloride (PLA-M), and PLA in methylene chloride: acetonitrile = 50: 50 (PLA-MA). The PLA-MA had higher % crystallinity, 46.15, than the PLA-C, 24.03, and the PLA-M, 14.25. With this increase in crystallinity, the PLA-MA had improved thermal expansion stability as shown by very low accumulated dimensional changes at 20 to 100 degrees C. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction identified multiple crystalline structures for the PLA-MA. Film barrier properties were also measured. PLA-MA had the lowest oxygen permeability. However, there was no significant difference in water vapor permeability among the three PLA films. The mechanical property tests revealed that the PLA-C and PLA-M were ductile while the PLA-MA was brittle in behavior. The PLA-MA was very hazy as compared with the PLA-C and PLA-M. This work has shown that the PLA-MA had increased % crystallinity and, more importantly, it had improved thermal expansion stability which can be very beneficial for the flexible packaging industry.

Tokarev, Alexander/G-4060-2012				Magnetic Rotational Spectroscopy with Nanorods to Probe Time-Dependent Rheology of Microdroplets								LANGMUIR				28	26			10064	10071		10.1021/la3019474			JUN 3 2012	2012	In situ characterization of minute amounts of fluids that rapidly change their rheological properties is a challenge. In this paper, the rheological properties of fluids were evaluated by examining the behavior of magnetic nanorods in a rotating magnetic field. We proposed a theory describing the rotation of a magnetic nanorod in a fluid when its viscosity increases with time exponentially fast. To confirm the theory, we studied the time-dependent rheology of microdroplets of 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA)/diethylene glycol dimethacylate (DEGDMA)-based hydrogel during photopolymerization synthesis. We demonstrated that magnetic rotational spectroscopy provides rich physicochemical information about the gelation process. The method allows one to completely specify the time-dependent viscosity by directly measuring characteristic viscosity and characteristic time. Remarkably, one can analyze not only the polymer solution, but also the suspension enriched with the gel domains being formed. Since the probing nanorods are measured in nanometers, this method can be used for the in vivo mapping of the rheological properties of biofluids and polymers on a microscopic level at short time intervals when other methods fall short.									19	1	0	2	0	20			0743-7463			WOS:000305869500021	22668085

Isolation and characterization of 12 microsatellites for the commercially important sablefish, Anoplopoma fimbria								CONSERVATION GENETICS RESOURCES				4	2			415	417		10.1007/s12686-011-9563-8			JUN 2012	2012	Sablefish, Anoplopoma fimbria, are long-lived, highly migratory, bathydemersal, commercially important fishes that inhabit continental slope waters of the North Pacific Ocean. Here we describe 12 microsatellite loci developed for sablefish, and cross-species amplification in skilfish, Erilepis zonifer. Microsatellites were developed from one sablefish and characterized using 55 juveniles collected in the eastern Gulf of Alaska. The number of alleles ranged from 3 to 27 per locus, and observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.074 to 0.964. There was no significant evidence for linkage disequilibrium or departure from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. Ten of the 12 microsatellite loci were successfully amplified in skilfish. These new microsatellites were developed for use in sablefish fishery management and conservation applications including selecting broodstock for aquaculture operations and defining population boundaries for stock assessments.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1877-7252			WOS:000303536400050

Geospatial Analysis Application to Forecast Wildfire Occurrences in South Carolina								FORESTS				3	2			265	282		10.3390/f3020265			JUN 2012	2012	Wildfire occurrence and intensity have increased over the last few decades and, at times, have been national news. Wildfire occurrence is somewhat predictable based on physical factors like meteorological conditions, fuel loads, and vegetation dynamics. Socioeconomic factors have been not been widely used in wildfire occurrence models. We used a geospatial (or geographical information system) analysis approach to identify socioeconomic variables that contribute to wildfire occurrence. Key variables considered were population change, population density, poverty rate, educational level, geographic mobility, and road density (transportation network). Hot spot analysis was the primary research tool. Wildfire occurrence seemed to be positively related to low population densities, low levels of population change, high poverty rate, low educational attainment level, and low road density. Obviously, some of these variables are correlated and this is a complex problem. However, socioeconomic variables appeared to contribute to wildfire occurrence and should be considered in development of wildfire occurrence forecasting models.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1999-4907			WOS:000315414900007

Design and Performance of Pilot-Scale Constructed Wetland Treatment Systems for Treating Oilfield Produced Water from Sub-Saharan Africa								WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION				223	5			1945	1957		10.1007/s11270-011-0996-1			JUN 2012	2012	Pilot-scale constructed wetland treatment systems (CWTSs) were designed and built to decrease concentrations of constituents of concern in water simulated to match characteristics of water produced from specific oilfields in sub-Saharan Africa. The oilfield produced water has low ionic strength (704-1,370 mg L-1 total dissolved solids) and contains Fe, Mn, Ni, Zn, and oil and grease (O&G). To treat these constituents, biogeochemical pathways were targeted in the design of two subsurface flow (SSF) CWTS series planted with Phragmites australis and a free-water surface (FWS) series planted with Typha latifolia. These systems were designed for prevailing conditions at the sub-Saharan site studied. Concentrations of O&G, Fe, Mn, Ni, and Zn in outflow from the SSF series met use criteria for irrigation and livestock watering. For the FWS series, outflow concentrations of O&G, Fe, and Mn met use criteria for irrigation and livestock watering, and Ni concentrations met use criteria for livestock watering. Both SSF and FWS series were effective in reducing concentrations of O&G in the produced water investigated with > 98% efficiency. The high-removal efficiency is attributed to achieving aerobic conditions in the wetland cells. Both SSF and FWS series reduced concentrations of Fe and Mn but with a wider range of efficiency compared with O&G removal. The removal of Ni and Zn could be increased by the addition of organic matter, such as plant detritus, to wetland cells to promote reducing conditions and dissimilatory sulfate reduction.									6	1	0	6	0	7			0049-6979			WOS:000304467000003

Contact solutions for a circular orthotropic beam accounting for transverse normal strain								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCE				55				1	17		10.1016/j.ijengsci.2012.01.011			JUN 2012	2012	A higher order orthotropic circular beam theory, which accounts for radial and circumferential normal strain, as well as deformations due to transverse shearing and bending, is developed using the principle of virtual work. As such, the governing differential equations are expressed in terms of the four independent stiffness quantities, EA(1), EA(2), GA and EI. Special cases that can be obtained by appropriate limits include a Timoshenko beam (GA, EI) and an Euler beam (EI) with or without axial extension (EA(2)). Using these equations the frictionless contact problem of a compressed ring is solved analytically and the significance of transverse normal strain is studied by comparing with solutions from the more elementary beam theories. Furthermore, the limitations of these theories are studied through comparison with plane elasticity solutions obtained using finite elements. The effect of the radial stiffness (EA(1)) on the contact pressure is quantified and shown to be important for many practical problems, such as a tire that includes the effect of a tread.

We consider the model where there is one designated master node and all other nodes are anonymous and have constant space. Recently, Lee et al. obtained such an algorithm for determining the size of a unidirectional ring. We provide a new algorithm that converges much quicker. This algorithm exploits a token-circulation idea due to Afek and Brown. Disregarding the time for stabilization, our algorithm computes the size of the ring at the master node in O(n log n) time compared to O(n(3)) steps used in the algorithm by Lee et al. We have also shown that the master node, after determining the size of the ring, can compute the average of observations made at each node in O(n) rounds or O(n(2)) steps. It seems likely that one should be able to obtain master-slave algorithms for other problems in networks.					12th Workshop on Advances in Parallel and Distributed Computational Models (APDCM)/International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS)12th Workshop on Advances in Parallel and Distributed Computational Models (APDCM)/International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS)	APR 19, 2010APR 19, 2010		Atlanta, GAAtlanta, GA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0129-0541			WOS:000306071800002		
J	Simionescu, Dan T.; Chen, Joseph; Jaeggli, Michael; Wang, Bo; Liao, Jun								Form Follows Function: Advances in Trilayered Structure Replication for Aortic Heart Valve Tissue Engineering								JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE ENGINEERING				3	2			179	202		10.1260/2040-2295.3.2.179			JUN 2012	2012	Tissue engineering the aortic heart valve is a challenging endeavor because of the particular hemodynamic and biologic conditions present in the native aortic heart valve. The backbone of an ideal valve substitute should be a scaffold that is strong enough to withstand billions of repetitive bending, flexing and stretching cycles, while also being slowly degradable to allow for remodeling. In this review, we highlight three overlooked aspects that might influence the long term durability of tissue engineered valves: (i) replication of the native valve trilayered histoarchitecture, (ii) duplication of the three-dimensional shape of the valve, (iii) and cell integration efforts focused on getting the right number and type of cells to the right place within the valve structure and driving them towards homeostatic maintenance of the valve matrix. We propose that the trilayered structure in the native aortic valve that includes a middle spongiosa layer cushioning the motions of the two external fibrous layers should be our template for creation of novel scaffolds with improved mechanical durability. Furthermore, since cells adapt to micro-loads within the valve structure, we believe that interstitial cell remodeling of the valvular matrix will depend on the accurate replication of the structures and loads, resulting in successful regeneration of the valve tissue and extended durability.									17	0	0	9	0	17			2040-2295			WOS:000311674500001	23355946

To date, cladding compositions have relied on commercially-available expedients and have not been tailored for the specific semiconductor core nor the application. In this work, more-optimum silicate and nonoxide glass compositions are developed for unary (Si, Ge), binary (InSb, GaAs), and ternary (GaAlSb) semiconductor cores based on two main design criteria: (1) matching the thermal expansion coefficient between semiconductor core and glass cladding and (2) matching the viscosity-temperature dependences such that the cladding glass draws into fiber at a temperature slightly above the melting point of the semiconductor. While this latter requirement is critical to the molten core fabrication method, which offers a practical approach to long fiber lengths at acceptable manufacturing speeds (>m/s), these compositions are more broadly applicable to other semiconductor fiber processing methods. Preliminary experimental results on silicon core optical fiber are provided and show a marked diminution in oxygen content relative to analogous fibers drawn using a pure silica cladding.									12	0	0	0	0	12			2041-1286			WOS:000310849000005

Sheet specimens were deformed through a series of four elliptical die inserts, with aspect ratios ranging between 1.0 and 0.4, producing ellipsoidal domes with different biaxial strain combinations. Testing was carried out in two scenarios, i.e. with the major strains aligned either along or across the rolling direction of the material. Circle grid analysis was then used to map the planar strains of the deformed specimens; the latter were used to generate comprehensive material forming limits curves (FLCs) that bound the safe, marginal and failure deformation zones. Orientation effects were quantified by constructing a "composite FLD" for each of the four sheets; the diagrams collectively showed that greater formability limits are achieved along the material's rolling direction. Furthermore, detailed comparisons between the four sheets were carried out based on formability limits, deformation uniformity, maximum dome height prior to failure, and fracture surface morphology and chemistry. Disparities in formability were linked to differences in grain structure and material inhomogeneities. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The resulting statistics are weighted sums of the squares of the sample autocorrelation coefficients that, unlike many other tests appearing in the literature, are numerically stable even when the number of lags considered is relatively close to the sample size. The statistics behave asymptotically as a linear combination of chi-squared random variables and their asymptotic distribution can be approximated by a gamma distribution. The proposed tests are modified to check for nonlinearity and to check the adequacy of a fitted nonlinear model. Simulation evidence indicates that the proposed goodness of fit tests tend to have higher power than other tests appearing in the literature, particularly in detecting long-memory nonlinear models. The efficacy of the proposed methods is demonstrated by investigating nonlinear effects in Apple, Inc., and Nikkei-300 daily returns during the 2006-2007 calendar years.

This was done using structured interviews to ask participants about multiple features of the novel nightstand designs.Results: There were several features that all groups preferred. There were also some distinctly opposing opinions between groups. In general, the patient group showed the most similarities to the other groups.Conclusion: This research explores differences and similarities in preferences for nightstand design across a variety of user groups. It yields ideas for improving the nightstand design to be useful for a wider group of people.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1937-5867			WOS:000309436900008	23224809

The Bayesian approach involves three steps: (1) prior estimate of the maximum ground settlement and model bias factor, (2) establishment of the likelihood function and posterior distribution of the model bias factor using the settlement measurement in the centrifuge test, and (3) development of posterior distribution of the predicted maximum settlement. This Bayesian approach is demonstrated with a case study of a well-documented braced excavation, and the results show that the accuracy of the maximum settlement prediction can be improved and the model uncertainty can be reduced with Bayesian updating.

The Impact of Information Technology Investments on Downside Risk of the Firm: Alternative Measurement of the Business Value of IT								JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS				29	1			159	193		10.2753/MIS742-1222290105			SUM 2012	2012	We examine the effect that investments in information technology (IT) have on downside risk profiles of companies that made public announcements of their investments in technology. Given the limitations of financial and decision theory perspectives on risk, we adopt the strategic management perspective that stresses downside risk as an important alternative measure of firm performance. We examine whether different types of IT investments have a differential impact on firm downside risk. Drawing on the resource-based view of the firm and the real options perspective, we find evidence that IT investments and their timing influence organizational downside risk. Transformational and informational IT investments lead to a reduction in downside risk only if they lead to strategic IT investments in the industry. For competitive necessities such as IT investments that automate business functions, a reduction in downside risk is realized by investing in parity with industry participants. Our study contributes to the literature by offering an alternative perspective on the benefits of IT investments, particularly where no apparent incremental financial results may be evident. It also generates insights on IT investment strategies that may help firms keep up with or stay ahead of the competition.									14	0	0	0	0	14			0742-1222			WOS:000308830800006

Exposure to Host Ligands Correlates with Colocalization of Gal/GalNAc Lectin Subunits in Lipid Rafts and Phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-Bisphosphate Signaling in Entamoeba histolytica								EUKARYOTIC CELL				11	6			743	751		10.1128/EC.00054-12			JUN 2012	2012	Entamoeba histolytica is an intestinal parasite that causes dysentery and liver abscess. Parasite cell surface receptors, such as the Gal/GalNAc lectin, facilitate attachment to host cells and extracellular matrix. The Gal/GalNAc lectin binds to galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine residues on host components and is composed of heavy (Hgl), intermediate (Igl), and light (Lgl) subunits. Although Igl is constitutively localized to lipid rafts (cholesterol-rich membrane domains), Hgl and Lgl transiently associate with this compartment in a cholesterol-dependent fashion. In this study, trophozoites were exposed to biologically relevant ligands to determine if ligand binding influences the submembrane distribution of the subunits. Exposure to human red blood cells (hRBCs) or collagen, which are bona fide Gal/GalNAc lectin ligands, was correlated with enrichment of Hgl and Lgl in rafts. This enrichment was abrogated in the presence of galactose, suggesting that direct lectin-ligand interactions are necessary to influence subunit location. Using a cell line that is able to attach to, but not phagocytose, hRBCs, it was shown that physical attachment to ligands was not sufficient to induce the enrichment of lectin subunits in rafts. Additionally, the mutant had lower levels of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2); PIP2 loading restored the ability of this mutant to respond to ligands with enrichment of subunits in rafts. Finally, intracellular calcium levels increased upon attachment to collagen; this increase was essential for the enrichment of lectin subunits in rafts. Together, these data provide evidence that ligand-induced enrichment of lectin subunits in rafts may be the first step in a signaling pathway that involves both PIP2 and calcium signaling.									12	0	0	10	0	12			1535-9778			WOS:000307190500005	22505337

Operational applications of Vectobac (R) 12AS (Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis) were conducted during times characterized by water temperature and turbidity extremes. Applications were conducted in the Yellow River in central Wisconsin targeting Simulium annulus and S. johannseni when water temperatures were 1-2 degrees C. Applications were conducted in the Green River in western North Carolina targeting the S. jenningsi group after a rain event, when portions of the treatment zone experienced turbidities of 276 nephelometric turbidity units. Excellent larvicidal activity was observed in both programs, with 97% mortality or greater being observed at distances over 5 km downstream of a treatment site. Mortality data for larval black flies in 2 operational suppression programs conducted in 2011 demonstrated a negligible effect of near-freezing water temperatures and exceptionally high turbidity on Bti activity.									2	0	0	3	0	3			8756-971X			WOS:000306556400013	22894128

The finger of an angel: memory return with epigenetic manipulation								EPIGENOMICS				4	3			295	302		10.2217/EPI.12.19			JUN 2012	2012	Scientists have been trying to crack the memory code for hundreds of years; however, centuries later, even the simplest elements of memory formation are still not fully understood. Recent studies in epigenetics indicate neuronal activity can induce transient reprogramming of epigenetic codes required for long-term memory consolidation. This suggests epigenetics as a basic mechanism in the regulation of long-term memory; and highlights the possibility that epigenetic modifications, as well as environmental factors, can change certain gene expression of brain neurons to restore the ability to remember, even with an aging brain or innate mental deficits. This article is an overview of basic knowledge and current research on epigenetic regulation of long-term memory, and prospects for future research.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1750-1911			WOS:000306530200008	22690665

Molecular characters supported the monophyly of the Simulium ceylonicum species group, but not of the Simulium batoense species group, suggesting that revisionary work is needed for the latter. Both ecological and geographical isolation of similar taxa were revealed. Stream velocity and altitude were among the principal ecological factors differing between closely related species. Most closely related species in the subgenus Gomphostilbia overlap geographically, suggesting the possibility of sympatric speciation driven by ecological divergence. Geographical isolation via dispersal also might have contributed to species divergence, while Pleistocene climate changes possibly influenced population genetic structure, demographic history, and speciation of some members of the subgenus.									8	0	0	7	0	8			1439-6092	1618-1077		WOS:000305528000007

A SIMPLE, FLEXIBLE ESTIMATOR FOR COUNT AND OTHER ORDERED DISCRETE DATA								JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECONOMETRICS				27	4			646	665		10.1002/jae.1211			JUN-JUL 2012	2012	This paper examines a flexible way to model empirically discrete data outcomes using 'hazard rate' decompositions. It presents a general data-generating mechanism based on potential outcomes to describe why the approach should work for almost any discrete distribution. Monte Carlo evidence indicates that these models estimate well the impacts of covariates on expected counts when the data follow a Poisson distribution. With data from more complex processes, these estimators continue to perform well. Since most economic count outcomes arise from occurrence-dependent behavioral processes, using flexibly estimated distributions should reduce the dependence of results on convenient but invalid assumptions.

This magnetic rotator allows one to generate rotating magnetic fields in a broad frequency band, from hertz to tens kilohertz. We illustrate its flexibility and robustness by conducting the rheological studies of simple and polymeric fluids at the nano and microscale. First we reproduce a temperature-dependent viscosity of a synthetic oil used as a viscosity standard. Magnetic rotational spectroscopy with suspended nickel nanorods was used in these studies. As a second example, we converted the magnetic rotator into a pump with precise controlled flow modulation. Using multiwalled carbon nanotubes, we were able to estimate the shear modulus of sickle hemoglobin polymer. We believe that this multifunctional magnetic system will be useful not only for micro and nanorheological studies, but it will find much broader applications requiring remote controlled manipulation of micro and nanoobjects.

J	White, Sarah A.; Taylor, Milton D.; Damrel, Dixie Z.								Floral Colonization of a Free-Water Surface Constructed Wetland System in Grady County, Georgia								CASTANEA				77	2			159	171		10.2179/11-045			JUN 2012	2012	A comprehensive survey of the vascular flora of a constructed wetland in Grady County, Georgia was conducted at monthly intervals between August 2004 and May 2006. The constructed wetland is used as a part of a nutrient remediation system to improve the sustainability of plant nursery water-handling practices. The survey evaluated vegetation in a 3.1 ha, two-stage constructed wetland consisting of two deep cells (Stage 1; mean depth 0.75 m) totaling 1.8 ha that drain into two shallow cells (Stage 2; mean depth 0.2 m) totaling 1.3 ha. Each cell was band planted in 1997 with seedlings or liners of six wetland plant species. During the 2-yr survey, 141 distinct species were collected from the 3.1 ha constructed wetland; of the taxa collected, there were 101 genera from 51 families. Native taxa made up 76.6% of the species recorded, and 24.1% of the taxa were introduced. Hydrophytic plants accounted for 68.1% of the plants collected and the remainder (31.9%) were classified as nonhydrophytes. Because 57.4% of the taxa surveyed were perennial, it is likely that plant propagules introduced by wildlife (waterfowl, reptiles, and amphibians) were the dominant method of plant introduction rather than primary succession. Vascular plant community diversity increased 24-fold during the 9-yr period after constructed wetland installation.									4	0	0	4	0	4			0008-7475			WOS:000305545100005

Evaluation of USDA Interval Forecasts Revisited: Asymmetry and Accuracy of Corn, Soybean, and Wheat Prices								AGRIBUSINESS				28	3			310	323		10.1002/agr.21295			SUM 2012	2012	This study evaluates the accuracy of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) interval forecasts for corn, soybean, and wheat prices using Christoffersen's (1998) tests for unconditional coverage, independence, and conditional coverage adjusted for asymmetries in tail probabilities. The findings demonstrate that due to the uneven distribution of forecast misses around the intervals, calibration of several corn, soybean, and wheat price forecasts was rejected by basic coverage tests (suitable for symmetric intervals), but not rejected by the tests adjusted for asymmetry. Thus, these forecasts were asymmetric, but accurate. USDA analysts should consider accounting for asymmetry and volatility of the underlying prices in their forecasts.

However, little is known about the factors that influence accountants' decisions to seek careers with different types of firms. In our paper, we use Ajzen's (1991) theory of planned behavior to examine the reasons why some accountants seek careers at Big 4 firms, while other accountants seek careers at non-Big 4 firms. We survey accounting students and find that attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control each influence firm-choice decisions. To provide additional insight into our results, we survey accounting professionals from Big 4 and non-Big 4 accounting firms. We find that, overall, students' perceptions, while more limited, are similar to those of accounting professionals. Further, we find that accounting professionals provide a number of insightful comments that offer several important implications for accounting firms. Finally, we assess whether accounting professionals perceive that certain types of accounting students are more likely to succeed at Big 4 versus non-Big 4 firms, and whether recruiting efforts are consistent with these perceptions.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0888-7993			WOS:000305803400004

White II, Gregory/F-8267-2013				Structural and Thermal Analysis of Lipid Vesicles Encapsulating Hydrophobic Gold Nanoparticles								ACS NANO				6	6			4678	4685		10.1021/nn2042016			JUN 2012	2012	The structure and stability of hybrid lipid vesicles containing bilayer-encapsulated hydrophobic nanoparticles is dependent upon lipid phase behavior. By embedding stearylamine-stabilized gold nanoparticles in dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine/dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol vesicles, we show that encapsulation at lipid to nanoparticle ratios from 10000:1 to 5000:1 leads to bilayer thickening and hydrophobic mismatch, favoring nanoparticle inclusion in gel phase vesicles. High loadings lead to large increases in the gel to fluid melting temperature upon heating and significant hysteresis on cooling, which cannot be attributed solely to excess free ligand. This behavior is due to a cooperative effect of excess free SA ligand and nanoparticle embedment. Nanoparticle clustering was observed during lipid melting and could be reversed upon lipid freezing owing to lateral capillary forces within the bilayer. The impact of nanoparticle embedment on vesicle structure and properties at such low concentrations is reminiscent of hydrophobic proteins, suggesting that the underlying lipid biophysics between proteins and nanoparticle are similar and may provide a predictive design tool for therapeutic applications.									19	0	0	3	0	19			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000305661300015	22632177

In this study, glucose fed-batch fermentation was performed to increase final biomass and lipid production. The biomass productivity and lipid productivity were 6.28 and 2.06 g/L day, respectively. Biomass/glucose conversion and the lipid/glucose conversion were 43.3% and 14.2%, respectively. Extraction of lipids from algae has been identified as a key bottleneck in bioprocessing operations. Supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) was applied for neutral lipids extraction and the SC-CO2 kinetics was investigated by the Goto et al. model. The modeling showed a good fit with experimental data. Additionally, neutral lipids extracted by SC-CO2 displayed a suitable fatty acid profile for biodiesel [mainly C18:1 (60.0%), C18:2 (18.7%) and C16:0 (11.5%)]. Our study demonstrated the ability to produce high levels of neutral lipids through heterotrophic algal culture and subsequent extraction of lipids with SC-CO2 method developed.

J	Wiley, Jenny L.; Marusich, Julie A.; Martin, Billy R.; Huffman, John W.								1-Pentyl-3-phenylacetylindoles and JWH-018 share in vivo cannabinoid profiles in mice								DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE				123	1-3			148	153		10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2011.11.001			JUN 1 2012	2012	Background: Smoking of synthetic cannabinoid-enhanced "herbal incense" is an emerging substance abuse problem. The indole-derived cannabinoids identified in these products were originally developed as research tools and are structurally distinct from cannabinoids in the cannabis plant. Although abused by humans, most published research on this class of compounds has been performed in vitro. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a novel series of 1-pentyl-3-phenylacetylindoles in mice. Methods: The potencies of these analogs to produce the cannabinoid agonist effects of antinociception, hypothermia and suppression of locomotion were evaluated in ICR mice. The major structural manipulations in the present series included the type of substituent (i.e., unsubstituted, methyl, methoxy, chloro, bromo, and fluoro) and the position of the substituent on the phenyl ring (i.e., 2-, 3- or 4-position). Results: Potencies of this series of phenylacetylindoles for each cannabinoid effect were highly correlated with CB1 receptor affinities reported previously. Active compounds produced a profile of effects that resembled that exhibited by Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The most critical factor affecting in vivo potency was the position of the substituent. Whereas compounds with 2- and 3-phenylacetyl substituents were efficacious with good potencies, 4-substituents resulted in compounds that had poor potency or were inactive. Conclusions: These results suggest that phenylacetylindoles with good CB1 binding affinity share pharmacological properties with THC in mice; however, they also emphasize the complexity of molecular interactions of synthetic cannabinoids with CB1 receptors and suggest that scheduling efforts based solely upon structural features should proceed with caution.

The mechanism of receptor binding by E. coli in eukaryotic cells differs based on the adhesin domains, patterns in the macromolecular structure and the ligand-binding groove. Current sensor technologies utilize biosensors that are based on the carbohydrate moieties that are involved in pathogen adhesion to host cells. Nanoparticles have been extensively used as carriers for pathogen detection. Gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) of 200 nm size were functionalized with two distinct glycoconjugates mannose (Mn-Au NPs) and Neu alpha c(alpha 2-3)-Gal-(beta 1-4)Glc-Paa (Sg-Au NPs) in order to investigate primary and fine sugar specificity of uropathogenic E. coli ORN178 and enterotoxigenic E. coli 13762, respectively. The UV-Vis measurement of pristine, 16-mercaptohexadecanoic acid (MHDA)/2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethanol (AEE)/sugar functionalized Au NPs showed a surface plasmon resonance band for Au. Dynamic light scattering analysis showed that the mean averages of the MHDA/AEE/Mn-Au NP samples increased due to aggregation. The negative zeta potentials of the samples were indicative of aggregation. Fine sugar specificity was observed when Neu alpha c(alpha 2-3)-Gal-(beta 1-4)Glc-Paa functionalized Au NPs (Sg-Au NPs) specifically showed binding with E. coli 13762 but not with E. coli ORN178. This specificity of E. coli strains to identify and bind to characteristic sugar moieties can be used in the development of biodiagnostic tools with Au NPs as carriers for diagnosis/treatment of human and veterinary diseases. In regards to the growing antibiotic resistance of microorganisms, gold nanoparticles can also be functionalized specifically to reverse adhesion of E. coli to host tissue and can be detected by their optical properties.									5	0	0	2	0	5			1557-1955			WOS:000305986300016

An Integrated Child Safety Seat Cooling System-Model and Test								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY				61	5			1999	2007		10.1109/TVT.2012.2191427			JUN 2012	2012	Vehicle safety remains a prominent automotive issue for engineers, consumers, and government regulators. One area that merits attention is the safety issue of when a child is left alone in a parked vehicle during the summer months when the ambient air temperatures are warmer. Injuries and deaths of infants, young children, and elderly adults have occurred due to elevated body temperatures for prolonged time periods. One proposed solution is the design of a car safety seat that offers temporary thermal protection to the occupant. This seat features thermoelectric cooling and forced air convection to maintain the body temperature within acceptable ranges for a limited time. In this paper, a system thermal model and experimental results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the thermoelectric-based safety system. The experimental system demonstrates the capability of maintaining localized cabin air temperatures below critical survivability thresholds in a closed parked vehicle for up to 95 minutes. This represents an 85% increase over standard child seating units, in cabin temperatures up to 69 degrees C, for an emulated 7 kg infant.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0018-9545			WOS:000305576800005

The simulated temperature, condensate production, contaminant and bromide concentrations are similar to experimental data. A key observation from the experiment and simulation is that boiling out approximately 1/2 pore volume (50 mL) of water results in the removal of essentially 100% of the dissolved volatile contaminant (1,2-DCA). A field-scale simulation using the multiple interacting continua (MINC) discretization approach is conducted to illustrate possible applications of thermal remediation of fractured geologic media, assuming uniform heating. The results show that after 28% of the pore water (including both steam vapor and liquid water) was extracted, and essentially all the 1,2-DCA mass (more than 99%) was removed.

In the 1st column, toluene was used as the SC solvent, and a monomer- and dimer-rich cut was obtained as the top product. In the 2nd column, supercritical pentane was used to obtain 96+% pure monomer (as top product) and 96+% pure dimer (as bottom product) streams. All of the monomer and almost 90% of the dimer present in the original feed pitch were recovered in these two product streams. High (>10) solvent-to-feed ratios, positive column temperature gradients, and rectifying/stripping (vs. stripping only) operation were all found to significantly improve selectivities for a given oligomer. The above two-column setup was also used to isolate a trimer-rich cut by using SC toluene as the solvent for both columns. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Ideal ultrafiltration membrane structures consist of high porosity, highly interconnected uniform pores in order to display a sharp molecular weight cut off (MWCO) as well as high permeate flux. In this work, uniform pore size, high-porosity ultrafiltration membranes were developed using three dimensionally-ordered macroporous templates. A membrane casting cell was designed for self-assembly of silica spheres into a colloidal crystal template. The resulting close-packed colloidal crystal was infiltrated with a reactive monomer solution. After polymerization, the silica spheres were etched away, resulting in an inverse colloidal crystal (ICC) membrane with high porosity and uniform pores that are highly interconnected.Atom transfer polymerization was used to tailor the membrane pore size. Poly[(polyethylene glycol) methacrylate] (PPEGMA) chains were grown from the outer and internal (pore) membrane surface. The resulting ultrafiltration membranes were characterized using FESEM, ATR-FTIR, XPS, and water contact angle measurements. PPEGMA chains were grown successfully from the membrane surface. Membrane performance was evaluated using direct flow filtration experiments. Dextran rejection and the variation of permeate flux with degree of modification were determined. Permeate flux decreased monotonically with increasing polymerization time, as the average pore size decreased. Surface modification may be used to convert a microporous ICC membrane into an ultrafiltration membrane. (C) 2012 Elsevier By.

The reliability index computed with this KCP technique is compared with those using other approaches such as the Excel Solver-based method. The new technique for determining the reliability index involves a global search method and is found effective and efficient. Reliability analysis with this KCP technique is then used to examine the influence of parameter uncertainties and correlations among the parameters on the failure probability of rock wedges. Significant findings are derived from the sensitivity and parametric analysis. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)GT.1943-5606.0000618.

Two abstraction factors are controlled in the experiment: the type of functions and the specificity of the terms, thus resulting in functional models are four level of abstraction. The user study shows that free language significantly improves the accuracy and speed of human interpretability over the functional basis vocabulary. Further, pruned function structures significantly improve the speed of interpretability over reverse-engineered function structures without a loss of accuracy. It is concluded that the levels of each factor are useful for different activities and stages of design. Recommendations are made for the appropriate combinations of factor levels for various design activities. [DOI: 10.1115/1.4006442]									3	0	0	0	0	3			1050-0472			WOS:000305116300002

From photoluminescence (PL), the asymmetric-shaped near-band-edge emission (NBE) peaks comprised of a free exciton (FX) and a longitudinal-optical phonon replica of the FX (FX-1LO) were observed from the ZnO thin films at room temperature (RT). The intensity ratio of the FX and the FX-1LO peaks decreased with increasing the temperature. The Huang-Rhys factor S of the ZnO thin films increased linearly from 0.576 to 1.519 with increasing the temperature, resulting from a decrease in the probability of exciton-phonon scattering. The crystal quality of the ZnO thin films was degraded with increasing the temperature. Nonetheless, the degradation of the crystal quality for the ZnO thin films grown on PS was much smaller than that of the ZnO thin films grown on Si substrates at higher temperatures.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0374-4884			WOS:000305223000022

Batsch] genome sequence has been recently made available to the scientific community. This represents the culmination of a long process that started less than two decades ago with the release of the first marker-based linkage maps. The process has advanced rapidly with the studies of molecular diversity, detection of genome positions of major genes and quantitative trait loci, development of large DNA sequence collections, transcriptome and proteome analyses, comparative genomic studies, construction of a physical map, and development of databases where researchers can access information. The growth of genomics knowledge has been partly due to the simplicity of the peach genome: short (230 Mbp), diploid, and distributed on eight pairs of chromosomes. Its unusually short intergeneration period (2-4 years) and selfing mating behavior, plus a dynamic peach scientific community that has often collaborated in the development of the necessary tools, have also facilitated in constructing a robust sequence of its complete genome. Peach is one of the best known species genetically among tree crops, with the promise of rapid advancement in the next few years. This paper reviews the resources available and the main results obtained, with emphasis placed on application to the development of improved varieties.									39	8	0	36	2	48			1614-2942	1614-2950		WOS:000305241900005

These databases hold similar sequence data and provide resources for the submission and recovery of this information in order to enable comparative genomics research. Large-scale genotype and phenotype projects have recently spawned the development of independent tools and interfaces within these repositories to deliver information to both geneticists and breeders. The increase in next generation sequencing projects has increased the amount of data as well as the scale of analysis that can be performed. These two repositories are now working towards a similar goal of archiving the diverse, independent data sets generated from genotype/phenotype experiments. This is achieved through focused development on data input standards (templates), pipelines for the storage and automated curation, and consistent annotation efforts through the application of widely accepted ontologies to improve the extraction and exchange of the data for comparative analysis. Efforts towards standardization are not limited to genotype/phenotype experiments but are also being applied to other data types to improve gene prediction and annotation for de novo sequencing projects. The resources developed towards these goals represent the first large-scale coordinated effort in plant databases to add informatics value to diverse genotype/phenotype experiments.									7	0	0	6	0	7			1614-2942			WOS:000305241900006

The Fagaceae is a large plant family comprising more than 900 species belonging to 8-10 genera. Using a wide range of molecular markers, population genetics and gene diversity surveys were the focus of many studies during the past 20 years. This work set the stage for investigations in genomics beginning in the early 1990s and facilitated the application of genetic and quantitative trait loci mapping approaches. Transferability of markers across species and comparative mapping have indicated tight macrosynteny between Quercus and Castanea. Omic technologies were more recently developed and the corresponding resources are accessible via electronic and physical repositories (expressed sequence tag sequences, single-nucleotide polymorphisms, candidate genes, cDNA clones, bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries) that have been installed in North America and Europe. BAC libraries and physical maps were also constructed in Castanea and Quercus and provide the necessary resources for full nuclear genome sequencing projects that are currently under way in Castanea mollissima (Chinese chestnut) and Quercus robur (pedunculate oak).									33	0	0	26	0	33			1614-2942	1614-2950		WOS:000305241900009

In Study 1, a two-wave study of hospital employees, results support the prediction that the mediated effect of envy on social undermining behavior through moral disengagement is stronger when employees have low social identification with coworkers. Study 2, a four-wave, multilevel study of student teams, shows that the indirect effect of envy on social undermining through moral disengagement is stronger in teams with low team identification and high team undermining norms.									54	4	0	1	1	59			0001-4273			WOS:000305072700007

A Quantitative Metric for Pattern Fidelity of Bioprinted Cocultures								ARTIFICIAL ORGANS				36	6			E151	E162		10.1111/j.1525-1594.2012.01460.x			JUN 2012	2012	This article describes a quantitative metric for coculture pattern fidelity and its use in the assessment of bioprinting systems. Increasingly, bioprinting is used to create in vitro cell and tissue models for the purpose of studying cell behavior and cell-cell interaction. To create meaningful models, a bioprinting system must be able to place cells in biologically relevant patterns with sufficient fidelity. A metric for assessing fidelity would be valuable for tuning experimental processes and parameters within a bioprinting system and for comparing performance between different systems. Toward this end, the "bioprinting fidelity index" (BFI), a metric which rates a bioprinted patterned coculture with a single number based on the proportions of correctly placed cells, is proposed. Additionally, a mathematical model of drop-on-demand printing is introduced, which predicts an upper bound on the BFI based on drop placement statistics. A proof-of-concept study was conducted in which patterned cocultures of D1 and 4T07 cells were produced in two different demonstration patterns. The BFI for the patterned cocultures was calculated and compared to the printing model fidelity prediction. The printing model successfully predicted the best BFI observed in the samples, and the BFI showed quantitatively that post-processing techniques negatively impacted the final fidelity of the samples. The BFI provides a principled method for comparing printing and post-processing methods.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0160-564X			WOS:000304751000002	22591403

Computational and Crystallographic Studies of Pseudo-Polyhalides								CRYSTAL GROWTH & DESIGN				12	6			2759	2768		10.1021/cg201231t			JUN 2012	2012	Pseudo-polyhalides represent a relatively new class of compounds in which the dihalogen molecules of the polyhalide ions are replaced by organohalogen molecules. Like polyhalides, the anion structure is strongly dependent on the size, shape, and charge of the countercation, but with additional variables provided by the specific organohalogen used. The charge transfer contribution to the halogen bonding interaction in polyhalides can be quite large but is much less so in the pseudo-polyhalides. Density functional calculations show that the interaction is primarily electrostatic. The charge-transfer contribution generally increases with increasing halogen bond strength but is not enough to cause significant angular dependence at the halide ion. The structures of 10 pseudo-polyiodide salts with either cryptand[2.2.2] (K222) or hexaethyleneglycol (HEG) encrypted alkali metal cations and tetraiodoethylene as the organohalogen are reported. Three salts obtained with M(K222)(+) have widely different structures ranging from steeply corrugated layers to more planar layers with pendant groups to a three-dimensional network. Identical stoichiometries with different cations (M(K222)(+) or M(HEG)(+)) give a layered or network solid, respectively, which are directly related. The latter has the unusual property of a completely disordered cationic phase, located within a perfect honeycomb anionic network.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1528-7483			WOS:000304838000009

Current strategies to identify enhancers focus primarily on noncoding sequences and tend to exclude protein coding sequences. Here, we analyzed 25 available ChlP-seq data sets that identify enhancers in an unbiased manner (H3K4me1, H3K27ac, and EP300) for peaks that overlap exons. We find that, on average, 7% of all ChlP-seq peaks overlap coding exons (after excluding for peaks that overlap with first exons). By using mouse and zebrafish enhancer assays, we demonstrate that several of these exonic enhancer (eExons) candidates can function as enhancers of their neighboring genes and that the exonic sequence is necessary for enhancer activity. Using ChlP, 3C, and DNA FISH, we further show that one of these exonic limb enhancers, Dync1i1 exon 15, has active enhancer marks and physically interacts with Dlx5/6 promoter regions 900 kb away. In addition, its removal by chromosomal abnormalities in humans could cause split hand and foot malformation 1(SHFM1), a disorder associated with DLX516. These results demonstrate that DNA sequences can have a dual function, operating as coding exons in one tissue and enhancers of nearby gene(s) in another tissue, suggesting that phenotypes resulting from coding mutations could be caused not only by protein alteration but also by disrupting the regulation of another gene.									67	1	0	61	0	68			1088-9051			WOS:000304728100007	22442009

In this study, the effect of pulsed electric field processing on neutral trehalase activity in beer yeast was investigated. In order to develop and optimize a pulsed electric field (PEF) mathematical model for activating the neutral trehalase, we have investigated three variables, including electric field intensity (10-50 kV/cm), pulse duration (2-10 mu s) and liquid-solid ratio (20-50 ml/g) and subsequently optimized them by response surface methodology (RSM). The experimental data were fitted to a second-order polynomial equation and profiled into the corresponding contour plots. Optimal condition obtained by RSM is as follows: electric field intensity 42.13 kV/cm, liquid-solid ratio 30.12 ml/g and pulse duration 5.46 mu s. Under these conditions, with the trehalose decreased 8.879 mg/L, the PEF treatment had great effect on activating neutral trehalase in beer yeast cells. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The highest dissoluble calcium malate content (7.075 mg/mL) was obtained with the 6.0% malic acid, the electric field intensity of 20 kV/cm, and pulse duration of 24 mu s. In vitro, ESCM prepared by the best conditions of PEF at doses of 133.0 mg kg(-1) d(-1) for 70 d not only significantly improve the ALP activity, the femur length and calcium content of bone of the mice (P<0.05) but also decreased the levels of TRAP (P<0.05). The ratio of calcium and phosphorus was in the normal range. PEF could be taken as a highly effective, environmentally friendly and energy-saving method for preparation of ESCM, which treated by PEF could promote the absorption of calcium in vitro, extraordinary can promote bone development and a healthy bone.

Microcapsules were prepared by spray drying after emulsification, using different mass ratios of gum arabic (GA) to AITC (3:1, 4:1, 5:1 and 6:1) with tween20 or span80. The microencapsulation efficiency and release characteristics of GA/AITC microcapsules were investigated. Retention of AITC during spray drying was increased as the mass ratio of GA to AITC increased. The Avarami's parameter n values of all AITC powders indicated that release of AITC was controlled by diffusion through the wall of the particles. The release rate of AITC was not only dependent on the emulsifier type, but also on the mass ratio of GA to AITC. The highest retention of AITC was achieved at a GA : AITC mass ratio of 4:1 in 0.7% tween20. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS AITC, the most abundant among isothiocyanates, is responsible for the pungent taste of Japanese horseradish (wasabi). It has strong antimicrobial activity, but its application is limited because of high volatility, strong odor, poor water solubility and reactions with natural food nucleophiles. Therefore, we employed microencapsulation technique to extend its shelf life and stability. This study can provide useful information for the application of AITC in food product formation.									5	0	0	2	0	5			0145-8884			WOS:000304808700001		
J	Jones, Joshua J.; Mears, Laine; Roth, John T.								Electrically-Assisted Forming of Magnesium AZ31: Effect of Current Magnitude and Deformation Rate on Forgeability								JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME				134	3					034504	10.1115/1.4006547			JUN 2012	2012	Currently, the automotive and aircraft industries are considering increasing the use of magnesium within their products due to its favorable strength-to-weight characteristics. However, the implementation of this material is limited as a result of its formability. Partially addressing this issue, previous research has shown that electrically-assisted forming (EAF) improves the tensile formability of magnesium sheet metal. While these results are highly beneficial toward fabricating the skin of the vehicle, a technique for allowing the use of magnesium alloys in the production of the structural/mechanical components is also desirable. Given the influence that EAF has already exhibited on tensile deformation, the research herein focuses on incorporating this technique within compressive operations. The potential benefit of using EAF on compressive processes has been demonstrated in related research where other materials, such as titanium and aluminum, have shown improved compressive behavior. Therefore, this research endeavors to amalgamate these findings to Mg AZ31B-O, which is traditionally hard to forge. As such, to demonstrate the effects of EAF on this alloy, two series of tests were performed. First, the sensitivity of the alloy to the EAF process was determined by varying the current density and platen speed during an upsetting process (flat dies). Then, the ability to utilize impression (shaped) dies was examined. Through this study, it was shown for the first time that the EAF process increases the forgeability of this magnesium alloy through improvements such as decreased machine force requirements and increased achievable deformation. Additionally, the ability to form the desired final specimen geometry was achieved. Furthermore, this work also showed that this alloy is sensitive to any deformation rate changes when utilizing the EAF process. Last, a threshold current density was noted for this material where significant forgeability improvements could be realized once exceeded.

Ethyl (E)-4,5-epoxy-2-hexenoate affords excellent S(N)2':S(N)2 regioselectivity and anti:syn product diastereoselectivity with dialkyzinc reagents in the presence of CuCN, and conversion of the resultant allylic alcohol to the acetate affords good syn:anti product diastereoselectivity in S(N)2'-selective allylic substitutions with alkylcyanocuprates in THF. (E)-1-(tert-Butyldimethylsilyloxy)-2,3-epoxy-4-hexenonate gives excellent S(N)2':S(N)2 regioselectivity and anti:syn product diastereoselectivity with dialkyzinc reagents in THF or DMF or Grignard reagents in Et2O/THF (10/1) in the presence of CuCN. Conversion of the product allylic alcohol into the allylic phosphate affords excellent S(N)2' regioselectivity and syn:anti product diastereoselectivity with lithium alkylcyanocuprates for primary and secondary alkyl transferable ligands, while S(N)2 regioselectivity is observed for the tert-butyl ligand. Reaction conditions have been developed for regio- and stereocontrolled bis-allylic substitution reactions on both electron-rich and electron-deficient alkenyloxiranes, providing a methodology for the generation of vicinal alkane stereogenic centers.									7	0	0	5	0	7			0022-3263			WOS:000304682400009	22524502

DOI: 10.1111/j.1752-1688.2012.00638.x Abstract: The sine-generated curve (SGC) presented by Langbein and Leopold (1966) is widely acknowledged as an idealized description of river meander form. However, as originally presented, the SGC application to the field, laboratory, or models is not a trivial task. The SGC function simply provides the direction of the flow path as its rate of change continually varies from most gradual at the crossover to most rapid at the apex of bends. Although the commonly used dimensions of meander length, stream length per meander, sinuosity, and amplitude have been approximated previously, this technical note precisely defines these dimensions by solving the integrals of the sine and cosine of the SGC function. This is performed using integral representations of the Bessel and Struve functions for the zero order and their power-series expansions. Higher precision offered by this technique will be of particular value to modeling and flume-based studies where better conformity to the SGC is necessary. The note goes on to present two simple line and arc patterns optimally fit to the SGC as simplified yet more precise methods for practical design in river restoration schemes. Equations are presented defining the geometry of the arc and line pattern and relating meander length, amplitude, radius of curvature, and sinuosity.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1093-474X	1752-1688		WOS:000304804400016

For both systems we find that the regime of chemical potential which supports the topological superconducting state in the presence of the superconducting proximity effect can be characterized by plateaus in the topological Hall and Nernst coefficients flanked by well-defined peaks marking the emergence of the topological regime. The plateaus arise from a clear momentum space separation between the region where the Berry curvature is peaked (at the "near-band-degeneracy" points) and the region where the single (or odd number of) Fermi surface lies in the Brillouin zone. The plateau for the Nernst coefficient is at vanishing magnitudes surrounded by two large peaks of opposite signs as a function of the chemical potential. These results could be useful for experimentally deducing the chemical potential regime suitable for realizing topological states in the presence of the proximity effect.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1098-0121			WOS:000304693600007		
J	Huda, Walter; He, Wenjun								Estimating cancer risks to adults undergoing body CT examinations								RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY				150	2			168	179		10.1093/rpd/ncr376			JUN 2012	2012	The purpose of the study is to estimate cancer risks from the amount of radiation used to perform body computed tomography (CT) examination. The ImPACT CT Patient Dosimetry Calculator was used to compute values of organ doses for adult body CT examinations. The radiation used to perform each examination was quantified by the dose-length product (DLP). Patient organ doses were converted into corresponding age and sex dependent cancer risks using data from BEIR VII. Results are presented for cancer risks per unit DLP and unit effective dose for 11 sensitive organs, as well as estimates of the contribution from oother organs'. For patients who differ from a standard sized adult, correction factors based on the patient weight and anteroposterior dimension are provided to adjust organ doses and the corresponding risks. At constant incident radiation intensity, for CT examinations that include the chest, risks for females are markedly higher than those for males, whereas for examinations that include the pelvis, risks in males were slightly higher than those in females. In abdominal CT scans, risks for males and female patients are very similar. For abdominal CT scans, increasing the patient age from 20 to 80 resulted in a reduction in patient risks of nearly a factor of 5. The average cancer risk for chest/abdomen/pelvis CT examinations was approximate to 26 higher than the cancer risk caused by osensitive organs'. Doses and radiation risks in 80 kg adults were approximate to 10 lower than those in 70 kg patients. Cancer risks in body CT can be estimated from the examination DLP by accounting for sex, age, as well as patient physical characteristics.									12	0	0	4	0	12			0144-8420			WOS:000305029200006	21926419

The elastic matrix critically maintains native structural configurations of vascular tissues, determines their ability to recoil after stretch, and regulates cell signaling pathways involved in morphogenesis, injury response, and inflammation via biomechanical transduction. The ability to tissue engineer vascular replacements that incorporate elastic matrix superstructures unique to cardiac and vascular tissues is thus important to maintaining vascular homeostasis. However, the vascular elastic matrix is particularly difficult to tissue engineer due to the inherently poor ability of adult vascular cells to synthesize elastin precursors and organize them into mature structures in a manner that replicates the biocomplexity of elastic matrix assembly during development. This review discusses current tissue engineering materials (e.g., growth factors and scaffolds) and methods (e.g., dynamic stretch and contact guidance) used to promote cellular synthesis and assembly of elastic matrix superstructures, and the limitations of these approaches when applied to smooth muscle cells, the primary elastin-generating cell type in vascular tissues. The potential application of these methods for in situ regeneration of disrupted elastic matrix at sites of proteolytic vascular disease (e.g., abdominal aortic aneurysms) is also discussed. Finally, the review describes the potential utility of alternative cell types to elastic tissue engineering and regenerative matrix repair. Future progress in the field is contingent on developing a thorough understanding of developmental elastogenesis and then mimicking the spatiotemporal changes in the cellular microenvironment that occur during that phase. This will enable us to tissue engineer clinically applicable elastic vascular tissue replacements and to develop elastogenic therapies to restore homeostasis in de-elasticized vessels.									28	0	0	15	0	28			1937-3368	1937-3376		WOS:000304797300004	22224468

Laser direct-write (LDW) was utilized to target and deposit solid polystyrene and stem cell-laden alginate hydrogel beads into computer-programmed patterns. We successfully demonstrated single-bead printing resolution and fabricated spatially-ordered patterns of microbeads. The probability of successful microbead transfer from the ribbon surface increased from 0 to 80% with decreasing diameter of 600 to 45 mu m, respectively. Direct-written microbeads retained spatial pattern registry, even after 10 min of ultrasonication treatment. SEM imaging confirmed immobilization of microbeads. Viability of cells encapsulated in transferred hydrogel microbeads achieved 37 +/- 11% immediately after the transfer process, whereas randomly-patterned pipetted control beads achieved a viability of 51 +/- 25%. Individual placement of > 10 mu m diameter microbeads onto planar surfaces has previously been unattainable. We have demonstrated LDW as a valuable tool for the patterning of single, micrometer-diameter beads into spatially-ordered patterns.									11	0	0	9	0	11			1758-5082			WOS:000304524700007	22556116

This study successfully established a HPLC-ELSD method for the simultaneous determination of phenolic acids, flavonoids and anthocyanins in muscadine grape. Twenty-four phenolics, including 5 anthocyanins, were identified by HPLC-UV-MS, ten of them were selected to calibrate the ELSD. Results from the ELSD quantification suggested that gallic acid, proanthocyanidins, and ellagic acid were the main phenolics in muscadines. In addition, antioxidant tests suggested that the extracts of muscadine grapes possessed strong antioxidant activities. All extracts had a high total phenolic content (TPC). High total anthocyanins contents (TAC) were found in Noble muscadine, and high proanthocyanidins content (TPA) in the seed portion. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This process is highly nonlinear and yet current models for it use linear filters to select the eddies that will be damped. In this report we consider for the first time nonlinear filters which select eddies for damping (simulating breakdown) based on knowledge of how nonlinearity acts in real flow problems. The particular form of the nonlinear filter allows for easy incorporation of more knowledge into the filter process and its computational complexity is comparable to calculating a linear filter of similar form. We then analyze nonlinear filter based stabilization for the Navier-Stokes equations. We give a precise analysis of the numerical diffusion and error in this process.									8	0	0	0	0	8			1422-6928	1422-6952		WOS:000304614300009

Although anecdotal reports and the scant empirical studies to date suggest job attitudes and perceptions are more positive for employees in organizations at higher levels of software process maturity, we found evidence of a more complex picture. While our data supported expectations that role conflict and perceived work overload were lower for IS professionals in organizations at a level of maturity where software process behavioral controls are implemented, other results were not fully in line with prevalent beliefs. Most notably, IS workers reported significantly lower professional efficacy and lower job satisfaction in organizations at CMM Level 3, where behavioral controls are the dominant form of formal control, than in organizations at Level I, which is relatively free of formal controls. Some anticipated positive attitudes and perceptions surfaced in organizations at the highest rungs of software process maturity (CMM Levels 4/5), where the established behavioral controls are supplemented by substantial outcome controls, as IS professionals reported lower role ambiguity and higher job satisfaction than did their counterparts in organizations at CMM Level 3.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0276-7783			WOS:000304296400013

Modern information technologies perform a critical role in the development and maintenance of a firm's absorptive capacity. We provide an assessment of absorptive capacity in the information systems literature. IS scholars have used the absorptive capacity construct in diverse and often contradictory ways. Confusion surrounds how absorptive capacity should be conceptualized, its appropriate level of analysis, and how it can be measured. Our aim in reviewing this construct is to reduce such confusion by improving our understanding of absorptive capacity and guiding its effective use in IS research. We trace the evolution of the absorptive capacity construct in the broader organizational literature and pay special attention to its conceptualization, assumptions, and relationship to organizational learning. Following this, we investigate how absorptive capacity has been conceptualized, measured, and used in IS research. We also examine how absorptive capacity fits into distinct IS themes and facilitates understanding of various IS phenomena. Based on our analysis, we provide a framework through which IS researchers can more fully leverage the rich aspects of absorptive capacity when investigating the role of information technology in organizations.									57	1	0	1	1	58			0276-7783			WOS:000304296400014

Prevalence and mental health outcomes of homicide survivors in a representative US sample of adolescents: data from the 2005 National Survey of Adolescents								JOURNAL OF CHILD PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY				53	6			687	694		10.1111/j.1469-7610.2011.02491.x			JUN 2012	2012	Background: Each homicide leaves behind several friends and family members, or homicide survivors. However, limited information is available on the impact of homicide on adolescent survivors. The purpose of the current study was to identify the prevalence of homicide survivorship and to determine mental health outcomes within a sample of US adolescent survivors. Methods: A nationally representative sample of American adolescents (N = 3,614) between the ages of 12 and 17 completed structured telephone interviews assessing homicide survivorship and mental health consequences including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, drug use, and alcohol abuse. Results: Reported prevalence within this sample of losing a loved one to criminal homicide was 9%, losing a loved one to vehicular homicide was 7%, and losing a loved one to both types of homicide was 2%. Logistic regression analyses found that adolescents who reported being homicide survivors were significantly more likely to report depression, drug use, and alcohol abuse after controlling for demographic factors and other violence exposure. Conclusions: If the results from this study are generalizable to the US population, roughly 1 in 5 American adolescents may be impacted by homicide. Further, adolescents exposed to such a loss are at increased risk for mental health sequelae. Results suggest that greater attention needs to be paid to address the needs of these often underserved victims.									14	0	0	1	0	14			0021-9630			WOS:000304087900010	22211367	
J	Smith, D. P.; Northcutt, J. K.; Steinberg, E. L.								Meat quality and sensory attributes of a conventional and a Label Rouge-type broiler strain obtained at retail								POULTRY SCIENCE				91	6			1489	1495		10.3382/ps.2011-01891			JUN 2012	2012	Some consumers have reported preferences for meat from alternative broiler strains as compared with meat from conventional broiler strains relative to taste and texture, but relatively few objective measurements have been conducted on these particular strains. To directly compare meat quality from a Label Rouge-type alternative and a conventional broiler strain available at retail, 4 ready-to-cook conventional and 6 alternative strain carcasses were obtained from retail or a processing plant on each of 6 cl. Boneless skinless breast fillets and boneless thighs were taken from each carcass and weighed. Raw meat was then assigned to different testing lots for cooking to evaluate yield, objective texture, meat color, sensory profile, and proximate composition (percentage protein, moisture, fat, and ash). Analyses of data revealed no significant difference (P < 0.05) due to broiler strain for percentage protein, moisture, fat; and ash, for either breast or thigh meat. Conventional breast (raw and cooked) weights were significantly higher than the alternative strain, but there was no difference in cooked yield. There were no differences between strain for thigh weights or yield. Both thigh and breast meat from the conventional broilers was more tender than meat from alternative broilers. Cooked conventional breast meat was darker and yellower, whereas cooked thigh was lighter, less red, and more yellow than alternative meat. Sensory analysis found no difference between strains for breast meat attributes. Conventional thigh meat scored higher than alternative for appearance, tenderness, juiciness, and how well the panelist liked the appearance, but there was no difference in aftertaste or overall liking. Although minimal differences were observed for cooked breast meat due to strain, conventional cooked thigh meat scored higher than the thigh meat from the Label Rouge-type alternative for most of the sensory attributes.									7	0	0	2	0	7			0032-5791			WOS:000304214700029	22582311

Our hypotheses were tested using a design in which participants viewed five videotapes in varying order. Each video showed different mixed-sex pairs of actors sharing meal and included a distinct form of food sharing or none. These were shown to 50 small groups of young adults in quasi-random sequences to control for order effects. Immediately after each video, viewers were asked about the attractiveness, attraction and intimacy in the dyad they had just observed. As predicted, videos featuring contaminated feeding consistently produced higher ratings on involvement and attraction than those showing uncontaminated feeding which, in turn, mostly produced higher ratings on involvement and attraction than those showing no feeding behaviors.

J	Lehnert, Matthew S.; Scriber, J. Mark								Salicaceae detoxification abilities in Florida tiger swallowtail butterflies (Papilio glaucus maynardi Gauthier): Novel ability or Pleistocene holdover?								INSECT SCIENCE				19	3			337	345		10.1111/j.1744-7917.2011.01459.x			JUN 2012	2012	Florida populations of the eastern tiger swallowtail butterfly, Papilio glaucus L., have unique morphological features and ecological adaptations that have contributed to their subspecies status (P. g. maynardi Gauthier). We describe geographically unique abilities for detoxification of Carolina willow, Salix caroliniana Michx. (Salicaceae), for several Florida populations of P. g. maynardi. Of all the approximately 570 worldwide species of the Papilionidae, such Salicaceae detoxification abilities exist only in the allopatric North American western and northernmost species (P. rutulus Lucas, P. eurymedon Lucas and P. canadensis Rothschild & Jordan). Females of P. glaucus collected from populations in southeastern USA were examined for oviposition preference in 5-choice assays, and displayed a low preference for Salicaceae (<5%), but larvae from Florida populations exhibited a high survival (>60%) on these plants. Detoxification abilities have previously shown to be autosomally inherited, and can be transferred via natural or hand-paired interspecific hybrid introgression. However, these Florida populations are at least 7001 500 km from the nearest hybrids or the hybrid species, P. appalachiensis Pavulaan & Wright, which possess these detoxification abilities. In any case, the Z ( = X)-linked oviposition preferences for Salicaceae are lacking in these Florida populations, illustrating genetic independence of oviposition preference determination and larval survival/performance abilities. The origins of detoxification abilities are unlikely to be due to recent climate-driven introgression, and may represent ancestral trait carry-overs from interglacial refugium populations of the Pleistocene epoch.									1	0	0	2	0	2			1672-9609	1744-7917		WOS:000304346200007

The structures of CsTh6F25 and NaTh3F13 are each described in space group P6(3) /mmc (No. 194) with a = 8.3507(12) and c = 16.914(3) a"<<, and a = 8.2570(12) and c = 16.891(3) a"<<, respectively. Both structures exhibit a framework structure containing pores, unlike most of their alkali metal thorium fluoride analogs. The significant structural difference between the two compounds, however, is the arrangement of the alkali metal within the pores formed in the framework. Accordingly the pores exhibit differing degrees of distortion depending on their contents.Two new alkali thorium fluorides, CsTh6F25 and NaTh3F13, have been synthesized hydrothermally and found to crystallize in space group P6(3) /mmc (No. 194) with both having an interesting structural difference in the contents of the pores formed from their framework structures.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1074-1542			WOS:000304352300013

Myoepithelial cell differentiation markers in prepubertal bovine mammary gland: Effect of ovariectomy								JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE				95	6			2965	2976		10.3168/jds.2011-4690			JUN 2012	2012	We reported previously that ovariectomy alters prepubertal development of mammary myoepithelial cells (MC) by mechanisms that are not well understood. Therefore, in the present study, we analyzed expression of 2 myoepithelial differentiation markers, alpha-smooth muscle actin (SMA) and the common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CD10), in mammary parenchymal tissue from intact (INT) and ovariectomized (OVX) heifers. On d 40, Holstein heifers underwent either an ovariectomy (OVX; n = 16) or a sham (TNT; n = 21) operation. At 55, 70, 85, 100, 130, and 160 d of age, tissues were collected, and multispectral imaging was used to quantify immunofluorescent staining for myoepithelial cell (MC) markers. Fluorescent intensity (FT) of the markers was normalized against a control sample. In the basal epithelial layer, CD10 FT was less and SMA FT was greater in OVX than INT. The ratio of SMA to CD10 FI, as a proxy indicator for MC differentiation, was greater in tissue from OVX compared with TNT heifers after 55 d of age. The staining for SMA was frequently more intense along the basal aspect of cells, whereas CD10 expression was localized on the apical surface of the MC. In mammary tissue from both TNT and OVX heifers, we observed basal cells that were negative for both CD10 and SMA, some of which appeared to span the distance from basement membrane to the ductal lumen. Interestingly, we also observed CD10(+) cells adjacent to the ductal lumen, a situation that was more prevalent in OVX than in TNT heifers. Also, ovariectomy affects MC expression of both SMA and CD10, as well as the pattern of MC development. Myoepithelial cells are known to limit parenchymal growth in other species. Involvement of MC as regulators of prepubertal bovine mammary development is worthy of further investigation.									7	0	0	6	0	7			0022-0302			WOS:000304215400020	22612934	
J	Moran, Amy L.; Woods, H. Arthur				Moran, Amy/F-7072-2011				Why might they be giants? Towards an understanding of polar gigantism								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY				215	12			1995	2002		10.1242/jeb.067066			JUN 2012	2012	Beginning with the earliest expeditions to the poles, over 100. years ago, scientists have compiled an impressive list of polar taxa whose body sizes are unusually large. This phenomenon has become known as. 'polar gigantism'. In the intervening years, biologists have proposed a multitude of hypotheses to explain polar gigantism. These hypotheses run the gamut from invoking release from physical and physiological constraints, to systematic changes in developmental trajectories, to community-level outcomes of broader ecological and evolutionary processes. Here we review polar gigantism and emphasize two main problems. The first is to determine the true strength and generality of this pattern: how prevalent is polar gigantism across taxonomic units? Despite many published descriptions of polar giants, we still have a poor grasp of whether these species are unusual outliers or represent more systematic shifts in distributions of body size. Indeed, current data indicate that some groups show gigantism at the poles whereas others show nanism. The second problem is to identify underlying mechanisms or processes that could drive taxa, or even just allow them, to evolve especially large body size. The contenders are diverse and no clear winner has yet emerged. Distinguishing among the contenders will require better sampling of taxa in both temperate and polar waters and sustained efforts by comparative physiologists and evolutionary ecologists in a strongly comparative framework.									11	1	0	10	0	13			0022-0949	1477-9145		WOS:000304423200005	22623187

Two-Level Weld-Material Homogenization for Efficient Computational Analysis of Welded Structure Blast-Survivability								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				21	6			786	796		10.1007/s11665-011-9876-5			JUN 2012	2012	The introduction of newer joining technologies like the so-called friction-stir welding (FSW) into automotive engineering entails the knowledge of the joint-material microstructure and properties. Since, the development of vehicles (including military vehicles capable of surviving blast and ballistic impacts) nowadays involves extensive use of the computational engineering analyses (CEA), robust high-fidelity material models are needed for the FSW joints. A two-level material-homogenization procedure is proposed and utilized in this study to help manage computational cost and computer storage requirements for such CEAs. The method utilizes experimental (microstructure, microhardness, tensile testing, and x-ray diffraction) data to construct: (a) the material model for each weld zone and (b) the material model for the entire weld. The procedure is validated by comparing its predictions with the predictions of more detailed but more costly computational analyses.									15	0	0	0	1	15			1059-9495			WOS:000304241200002

Equilibrium molecular-dynamics simulations are used first to validate that the initial (unshocked) fused silica possesses the appropriate mass density and microstructure (as characterized by its partial Si-Si, Si-O, and O-O radial distribution functions). Next, non-equilibrium molecular-dynamics simulations are employed, within a continuously contracting computational-cell scheme, to generate planar longitudinal (uniaxial motion) shocks of different strengths. By examining and quantifying the dynamics of shock-wave motion, the respective shock-Hugoniot relations (i.e., functional relations between various material-state variables in the material states produced by the shocks of different strengths) are determined. This methodology suggested that irreversible non-equilibrium deformation/damage processes play an important role in the mechanical response of fused silica to shock loading and that the "equilibrium" procedures for Hugoniot determination based on the equation of state and the Rankine-Hugoniot equation may not be fully justified. Finally, the non-equilibrium molecular-dynamics simulations were used to identify the main microstructure modifying/altering processes accompanying the shock-wave motion through fused silica.									8	0	0	0	0	8			1059-9495	1544-1024		WOS:000304241200005

All calculations were carried out using ABAQUS/Explicit commercial finite element program (ABAQUS Version 6.7, User Documentation, Dessault Systems, 2007), and the computational results obtained were compared to their experimental counterparts obtained by Dolan (Ballistic Transparent-armor Testing Using a Multi-hit Rifle Pattern, Bachelors, Thesis, Kettering University, December 2007). The comparison revealed that (a) The proposed computational procedure can reasonably well account for the observed multi-hit ballistic-protection performance of the laminated transparent armor; (b) The role of prior bullet hits in reducing armor's ballistic-protection performance is clearly revealed; (c) The role of polycarbonate lamina in preventing glass fragments from entering the vehicle interior is clearly demonstrated; and (d) Experimentally observed inability of the transparent armor to defeat 0.50-caliber Fragment Simulating Projectiles (FSPs) is confirmed.									10	0	0	0	0	10			1059-9495			WOS:000304241200006

The goal of this work is to provide a feasibility analysis of these novel silicate glasses as heavily-doped gain media for fiber-amplifier applications. Amplifier performance currently is limited by background losses arising from the precursor crystalline rod. Both basic spectroscopic measurements and fiber amplifier experiments, in addition to modeling efforts that include the background losses, are presented. The findings show that Yb:YAG-derived fibers are spectroscopically very similar to more conventional Yb-doped aluminosilicate materials but can be doped to considerably higher concentration, generally have greater doping and compositional uniformity, and possess advantageous stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) characteristics.

A loom was designed and constructed, and a feasibility study was conducted on auto-loom woven, degummed silk mesh seeded with murine-derived D1 multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). Meshes of two different pore sizes, 1 mm and 2 mm, were investigated. The seeded meshes were evaluated using a variety of assays to determine cellular metabolic activity, viability, and conformation at time points of 7, 14, and 21 days. The assays showed substantial cell attachment to the mesh at all time points, including penetration of cells into the interior of silk threads. Metabolic activity peaked at Day 14 for both mesh sizes, with a sharp rise in protein production from Day 7 to 14. Based upon the successful production of mesh and acquisition of results from the assays performed, it can be concluded that an in vitro evaluation system for hernia mesh is both possible and likely to produce scientifically relevant results.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1738-2696			WOS:000304401000002

Sox9 is induced and maintained in prechondrogenic cells during condensation formation and endochondral ossification. Using explant culture, we determined that pharyngeal endoderm was sufficient, but not necessary for specifying prechondrogenic identity, as surrounding tissues including the otic vesicle can compensate for signals from the pharyngeal endoderm. Multiple Fgf genes are expressed specifically in the pharyngeal endoderm subjacent to the neural crest-derived mesenchyme. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling is both sufficient and required for specification of Sox9 expression and specification of prechondrogenic identity, as demonstrated by the addition of recombinant FGF protein or the FGF receptor inhibitor (SU5402) to explanted tissue, respectively. However, FGF signaling cannot maintain Sox9 expression or initiate the chondrogenic program as indicated by the absence of Col2a1 transcripts. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 4 signaling can induce and maintain Sox9 expression in isolated mesenchyme, but only in combination with FGF signaling induce Col2a1 expression, and thus, chondrogenesis. Given the spatiotemporal expression patterns of FGFs and BMPs in the pharyngeal arches, we suggest that this may represent a general mechanism of local signals specifying prechondrogenic identity and initiation of the chondrogenic program.

In contrast to the plant-derived cannabinoids in medical marijuana and other cannabinoid-based therapeutics, the commonly encountered synthetic cannabinoids in these mendaciously labeled products constitute a structurally diverse set of compounds of relatively unknown pharmacology and toxicology. Indeed, the use of these substances has been associated with an alarming number of hospitalizations and emergency room visits. Moreover, there are already several hundred known cannabinoid agonist compounds that could potentially be used for illicit purposes, posing an additional challenge for public health professionals and law enforcement efforts, which often require the detection and identification of the active ingredients for effective treatment or prosecution. A solid-phase microextraction headspace gas chromatographymass spectrometry method is shown here to allow for rapid and reliable detection and structural identification of many of the synthetic cannabinoid compounds that are currently or could potentially be used in herbal smoking mixtures. This approach provides accelerated analysis and results that distinguish between structural analogs within several classes of cannabinoid compounds, including positional isomers.

This work reports the quantitative component of a mixed-methods study of the effect of cooperative problem-based laboratory instruction on problem-solving ability and regulatory metacognitive activity. For this purpose, a previously reported assessment, IMMEX, was used. Mixed-methods evidence suggests that students in such an environment showed improved problem-solving skills and strategies, and showed increased regulation of metacognitive skills, despite a lack of explicit instruction. This work puts forth the proposal that providing an environment that is conducive to social interaction and reflection allows students to develop these desirable skills.									28	0	0	0	2	29			0021-9584			WOS:000304021300005

We then discuss a number of recent applications of these approaches in both civilian and military initiatives.Conclusions: Stigma-change programs specifically created by/for the military that integrate components of education and direct contact with respected peers or veterans who have coped with mental health problems may have great utility at both the early stages of military training and later, when soldiers return from theatres of operation.									23	0	0	5	0	23			0963-8237			WOS:000304066800006	22250849

Efficiency for multiobjective multidisciplinary optimization problems with quasiseparable subproblems								OPTIMIZATION AND ENGINEERING				13	2			293	318		10.1007/s11081-011-9136-4			JUN 2012	2012	Multidisciplinary optimization (MDO) has proved to be a useful tool for engineering design problems. Multiobjective optimization has been introduced to strengthen MDO techniques and deal with non-comparable and conflicting design objectives. A large majority of papers on multiobjective MDO have been applied in nature. This paper develops theory of multiobjective MDO and examines relationships between efficient solutions of a quasi-separable multiobjective multidisciplinary optimization problem and efficient solutions of its separable counterpart. Equivalence of the original and separable problems in the context of the Kuhn-Tucker constraint qualification and efficiency conditions are proved. Two decomposition approaches are proposed and offer a possibility of finding efficient solutions of the original problem by only finding efficient solutions of the subproblems. The presented results are related to algorithms published in the engineering literature on multiobjective MDO.									2	1	0	0	0	3			1389-4420	1573-2924		WOS:000304146200006

Prevalence and risk of psychiatric disorders as a function of variant rape histories: results from a national survey of women								SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGY				47	6			893	902		10.1007/s00127-011-0397-1			JUN 2012	2012	Rape is an established risk factor for mental health disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive episodes (MDE), and substance use disorders. The majority of studies have not differentiated substance-involved rape or examined comorbid diagnoses among victims. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to estimate the prevalence of common trauma-related psychiatric disorders (and their comorbidity) in a national sample of women, with an emphasis on distinguishing between rape tactics. A secondary objective was to estimate the risk for psychiatric disorders among victims of variant rape tactics, in comparison to non-victims.A nationally representative population-based sample of 3,001 non-institutionalized, civilian, English or Spanish speaking women (aged 18-86 years) participated in a structured telephone interview assessing rape history and DSM-IV criteria for PTSD, MDE, alcohol abuse (AA), and drug abuse (DA). Descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression analyses were employed.Women with rape histories involving both substance facilitation and forcible tactics reported the highest current prevalence of PTSD (36%), MDE (36%), and AA (20%). Multivariate models demonstrated that this victim group was also at highest risk for psychiatric disorders, after controlling for demographics and childhood and multiple victimization history. Women with substance-facilitated rapes reported higher prevalence of substance abuse in comparison to women with forcible rape histories. Comorbidity between PTSD and other psychiatric disorders was higher among rape victims in comparison to non-rape victims.Researchers and clinicians should assess substance-facilitated rape tactics and attend to comorbidity among rape victims. Empirically supported treatments are needed to address the complex presentations observed among women with variant rape histories.									17	0	0	6	0	17			0933-7954			WOS:000304171300006	21603967

In this study, a new SWCC equation is developed that uses four fitting parameters including the maximum possible suction. The new model predicts the experimental data of various soils well for a wide range of degrees of saturation (DOS), especially in high suction (above 10,000 kPa). Predicting the higher suction at low DOS is one of the deficiencies of the widely used Brooks and Corey, van Genuchten, and Fredlund and Xing models. The numerical stability and performance of the proposed, and other widely used models, are investigated by implementing these models within in a simplified finite-element program for the dynamics of unsaturated soil and simulating static and dynamic problems. For the midrange DOS, all of the aforementioned models predict similar responses. However, at low DOS the new model predicts the suction variations well compared with the other models.

Using enzymatic hydrolysis rate as a bioconversion metric, we have investigated the relationship between the biomass crystallinity index (CI) and hydrolysis yield potential (HYP) among similar to 20 Sorghum bicolor varieties grown in two environments. The comparison of HYP to CI revealed a significant negative correlation in both environments indicating that high cellulose crystallinity in sorghum can have an impact on conversion yield. Interestingly, no correlation was seen between CI and HYP after pretreatment. Compositional analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between lignin content and CI, as well as a significant negative correlation between lignin content and HYP. Additionally, CI and HYP were found to be significantly correlated only after 24 h of hydrolysis. These results suggest that when a sorghum cultivar is being considered for industrial scale production, the inclusion of cellulose crystallinity should be factored into the decision along with total biomass yield and lignin composition.									8	0	0	6	0	8			1939-1234			WOS:000303480800012

The effects of cross-linking density on the diffusivity of calcium ions through cell culture compatible poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) [poly(HEMA)]-based bioactive hydrogels possessing 1.0 mol% 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC), 5 mol% N,N-(dimethylamino)ethylmethacrylate (DMAEMA) and ca. 17 mol% -butyl acrylate (n-BA) have been investigated to determine if varying cross-link density is a viable approach to controlling transport of calcium across hydrogel membranes. Cross-linking density was varied by changing the composition of cross-linker, tetraethyleneglycol diacrylate (TEGDA). The hydrogel membranes were formed by sandwich casting onto the external surface of track-etched polycarbonate membranes (T = 10 mu m, phi = 0.4 mu m pores) of cell culture inserts, polymerized in place by UV light irradiation and immersed in buffered (0.025 HEPES, pH 7.4) 0.10 M calcium chloride solution. The transport of calcium ions across the hydrogel membrane was monitored using a calcium ion selective electrode set within the insert. Degree of hydration (21.6 +/- 1.0%) and void fraction were found to be constant across all cross-linking densities. Diffusion coefficients, determined using time-lag analysis, were shown to be strongly dependent on and to exponentially decrease with increasing cross-linking density. Compared to that found in buffer (2.0-2.5 x 10(-6) cm(2)/s), diffusion coefficients ranged from 1.40 x 10(-6) cm(2)/s to 1.80 x 10(-7) cm(2)/s and tortuosity values ranged from 1.7 to 10.0 for the 1 and 12 mol% TEGDA cross-linked hydrogels respectively. Changes in tortuosity arising from variations in cross-link density were found to be the primary modality for controlling diffusivity through novel n-BA containing poly(HEMA)-based bioactive hydrogels.									10	0	0	4	0	10			1387-2176			WOS:000303871400011	22426887

Sixteen individuals of C. nasus from Ariake Bay in Japan were genotyped using 24 PCR primers to characterize the polymorphism at each locus. The average number of the observed alleles per locus was 11.08 (ranging from 8 to 20). The observed heterozygosity values ranged from 0.562 to 1.0, and the expected heterozygosity values ranged from 0.647 to 0.969. Only one of the twelve loci deviated significantly from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and linkage disequilibrium was not found in any pairs of the loci. These markers can be used to investigate the genetic structure of the C. nasus population.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1877-7252	1877-7260		WOS:000303536400075

A systematic analysis of the bacterial community associated with freshly emerged adult black flies of four North American species, using cultivation-independent molecular techniques, revealed 75 nonsingleton bacterial phylotypes. Although 17 cosmopolitan phylotypes were shared among host species, each fly species had a distinct bacterial profile. The bacterial composition, however, did not correlate strongly with the host phylogeny but differed between male and female flies of the same species from the same habitat, demonstrating that a group of insects have a gender-dependent bacterial community. In general, female flies harbor a less diverse bacterial community than do males. The anatomical locations of selected bacteria were revealed using fluorescence in situ hybridization. Understanding the physiological function of the associated bacterial community could provide clues for developing novel pest-management strategies.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0168-6496			WOS:000303761900013	22356591

Imaging quasi-vertical geological faults with earthquake data								GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL				189	3			1584	1596		10.1111/j.1365-246X.2012.05424.x			JUN 2012	2012	We present a method for imaging quasi-vertically dipping faults with surface records of reflected P waves from small earthquakes. Faults are boundaries between geological structures, such as tectonic plates, and are located in earthquake active regions such as Parkfield, California. The high degree of seismic activity enables the use of multiple seismic recordings in our fault identification algorithm. Major challenges occur because of the quasi-vertical orientation of the fault and the fact that the wave reflected by the fault and recorded by the surface receivers is not well modelled by the direct arrival of the propagating wave generated by the earthquake source. Our method uses the 2-D acoustic wave equation as the model for P-wave propagation. We assume that an approximate wave speed map on the reflection side of the fault is available and the source locations are known, for example, from traveltime tomography. We also assume that the source time function is known. The new features of our method arise because earthquake sources are located very close to the fault. This has two implications: (1) the direct arrival and the reflected wave arrive almost simultaneously, so that it is impossible to separate them on a seismogram using standard techniques, and (2) most of the reflections occur above the critical angle which introduces a distortion in the reflected wave. To overcome these difficulties we use a modelled incident wave to (1) remove the direct arrival from the data, and (2) remove the post-critical distortion from the reflected wave. We justify the distortion removal using the leading-order term of an asymptotic expansion, and an optimization procedure. To complete our algorithm we utilize some features of reverse time migration: (1) the use of full acoustic wave equation for modelling and backpropagation, and (2) zero-lag correlation of the backpropagated time reversed reflected and incident fields. We present numerical examples of fault reconstructions with synthetic data.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0956-540X	1365-246X		WOS:000303857000025

Effect of staged ovariectomy on measures of mammary growth and development in prepubertal dairy heifers								ANIMAL				6	6			941	951		10.1017/S1751731111002333			JUN 2012	2012	Previous studies in prepubertal heifers suggest that the magnitude of reduction in mammary parenchymal growth in response to ovariectomy varies with the age at which surgery is performed. We hypothesized that ovarian secretions are essential for initiating mammary development but not required to maintain allometric mammary growth in prepubertal dairy heifers. The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of staged ovariectomy during the prepubertal period on mammary growth and tissue composition and the expression of selected genes. Prepubertal Holstein heifers at 2, 3 or 4 months of age were randomly assigned to one of two treatments, ovariectomized (OVX; n = 12) or sham operated (INT; n = 12). Mammary parenchyma (PAR) and fat pad (MFP) were harvested 30 days after surgery. Proximate composition of PAR and MFP (DNA, protein and lipid) as well as expression of the selected estrogen-responsive genes stanniocalcin1 (STC1), tissue factor pathway inhibitor precursor (TFPI) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were determined in PAR and MFP by quantitative real-time PCR. The relative amount of epithelium and proportion of epithelia cell nuclei expressing the proliferation marker Ki67 were determined by histological and immunohistochemical analyses, respectively. MFP mass was not impacted by treatment but was decreased with age as was lipid content and concentration (P <= 0.01). The mass of mammary PAR was reduced in OVX and increased with age (P <= 0.01). Parenchymal tissue tended to have less total DNA, protein and lipid in OVX heifers. Parenchymal tissue concentrations of protein and DNA were increased with age and there was an age X treatment interaction. Treatment had no effect on either the Ki67 labeling index or percent epithelial area. The relative abundances of STC1, TFPI and PCNA mRNA in PAR were reduced in OVX. We did not find a significant impact of ovariectomy on mRNA expression when surgery was performed at 2 months compared with surgery at 3 or 4 months of age. However, having nearly undetectable PAR in two heifers ovariectomized at the earliest period (2 months of age) suggests that early ovariectomy is especially detrimental to subsequent parenchymal development.									5	0	0	5	0	5			1751-7311			WOS:000303500400010	22558965

CUSUM ANALYSES OF TIME-INTERVAL DATA FOR ONLINE RADIATION MONITORING								HEALTH PHYSICS				102	6			637	645		10.1097/HP.0b013e3182430106			JUN 2012	2012	Three statistical control chart methods were investigated to determine the one with the highest detection probability and the best average run length (ARL). The three control charts include the Shewhart control chart of count data, cumulative sum (CUSUM) analysis of count data (Poisson CUSUM), and CUSUM analysis of time-interval (time difference between two consecutive radiation pulses) data (time-interval CUSUM). The time-interval CUSUM (CUSUMti) control chart was compared with the Poisson CUSUM (CUSUMcnt) and the Shewhart control charts with experimental and simulated data. The experimental data were acquired with a DGF-4C (XIA, Inc.) system in list mode. Simulated data were obtained by using Monte Carlo techniques to obtain a random sampling of a Poisson process. All statistical algorithms were developed using R (R Development Core Team). Detection probabilities and ARLs for the three methods were compared. The time-interval CUSUM control chart resulted in a similar detection probability as that of the Poisson CUSUM control chart but had the shortest ARL at relatively higher radiation levels; e.g., about 40% shorter than the Poisson CUSUM at 10.0 counts per second (cps) (five times above the background count rate). Both CUSUM control charts resulted in a higher detection probability than that of the Shewhart control chart; e.g., 100% greater than the Shewhart control method at 4.0 cps (two times above the background count rate). In addition, when time-interval information was used, the CUSUM control chart coupled with a modified runs rule (mrCUSUM(ti)) showed the ability to further reduce the time needed to respond to changes in radiation levels and keep the false positive rate at a required level.

Assets sold above market value are followed by positive and significant abnormal returns over the following three months; these returns are magnified in firms where the balance of power in corporate governance favors shareholders. Abnormal returns following undervalued asset sales are insignificant from zero, indicating value-preservation. Value-preservation when the assets are sold below market value becomes less likely as firms approach financial constraints. The reverse is true when assets are sold above market value. This evidence is documented for apartment REITs, which have a large number of comparable transactions available for estimating expected market values.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0920-8550			WOS:000303383200001

In addition, the paper reports an analysis and evaluation of issues related to real time control implementation for the modeled PHEV system, which include the optimization window sizes and the impact of prediction errors on the energy optimization strategy performance. The optimization time window sizes were identified and validated for different driving cycles under different operating modes and total length of travel. With the identified optimization windows size, improvements in fuel consumption were realized: the highest improvement was for Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS), with a range of improvement of 14-31%, followed by a 1-15% range of improvement for Highway Fuel Economy Driving Schedule (known as HWFET) and a 1-8% range of improvement for US06 (also known as Supplemental Federal Test Procedure). While no correlation was observed between the error rate and the rate of increased fuel consumption, this PHEV system still yielded energy savings with errors in the speed prediction, which is an indication of robustness of this PHEV model.

The energy and energy-dissipation rate for the enhanced model are derived. It is also shown that the consistency error, relative to the Navier-Stokes equations, and the microscale of the enhanced model are less than those of the Navier-Stokes-alpha beta model. The proposed model is used to simulate the Taylor-Green vortex problem and results show a qualitatively improved representation of the mean-square vorticity when compared to the Navier-Stokes-alpha beta model. Numerical studies of the energy spectrum and the alignment between the vorticity and the eigenvectors of the stretching tensor for three-dimensional turbulent flows with Re = 200 are used to explore the utility of the model. A benchmark problem of a two-dimensional channel flow over a step for Re = 600 also indicates that this model can be applied to more general flows than those involving periodic boundary conditions.

Modification of ultrafiltration membranes with block copolymer nanolayers for produced water treatment: The roles of polymer chain density and polymerization time on performance								JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE				403				250	260		10.1016/j.memsci.2012.02.061			JUN 1 2012	2012	This contribution describes the development of advanced membranes for produced water treatment through modification of low molecular weight cut-off regenerated cellulose ultrafiltration membranes with uniquely structured block copolymer nanolayers. Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-block-poly((polyethylene glycol) methacrylate) (PNIPAAm-b-PPEGMA) nanolayers were grafted from the membrane using surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization. A focus of this study was to better understand the role of polymer nanolayer structure on performance. Specifically, the objective of this work was to use initiator grafting density and PNIPAAm and PPEGMA polymerization times as independent variables to optimize the performance of the surface-modified membranes. Membrane performance was evaluated by measuring water flux using deionized water, synthetic produced water developed from an oil-in-water emulsion, and actual oil-field produced water. Optimization of nanolayer structure yielded membranes with stable permeabilities that compare well to commercial membranes used for removal of organics with high salt passage. The results show that nanolayer structure plays an important role in determining the effectiveness of a polymer coating for fouling prevention, even for polymers that are recognized by the community to have good antifouling characteristics. The membrane surface modification protocol allows optimization of nanolayer structure in ways not achievable by standard coating methods. Visualization by confocal laser scanning microscopy shows that the modification occurs at the membrane external surface and internally within the porous cellulose layer. The modification protocol was used in this study to design highly advanced membranes to separate emulsified oils from produced water. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Warm additives are available both in a liquid and solid state: there are concerns over the rutting performance of WMA. The purpose of this study is to investigate and characterize the effects of various warm additives on the rutting performance of asphalt concrete with different binders and mixing temperature applications. The results showed that the lowered mixing temperature increases the rutting susceptibility due to reduced binder aging. The wax warm additives stiffen the binder, and can offset the rutting problem rendered by the lowered mixing temperature, while the chemical warm additives have the same rutting performance as the control mixtures.

Two emulsifiers, stearic acid (SA) and lauric acid (LA), with three ratios of shellac to emulsifier (100: 1, 20: 1, and 10: 1) were tested to select the best ratio of shellac to emulsifier before testing the effect of shellac concentration. When compared to pure HPMC film, the WVP was decreased by 6 and 11% in the Sh-HPMC-CFs containing shellac to LA (ShLA) ratios of 100: 1 and 20: 1, respectively. However, all the ShSA-HPMC-CFs had higher WVP than the pure HPMC film. In relation to mechanical properties, the ShLA(20: 1)-HPMC-CF had the lowest reduction in TS when compared to a pure HPMC film. Therefore, ShLA(20: 1) was selected for further characterization. Surface morphology, cross sectional image, thermal stability, WVP, and mechanical properties of the Sh-HPMC-CFs were also measured at varying shellac concentrations (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5%). The 0.1 and 0.5% Sh-HPMC-CFs had good distribution of shellac in the film structure while the 1.0 and 1.5% Sh-HPMC-CFs exhibited some agglomeration of shellac. The 0.1 and 0.5% Sh-HPMC-CFs had better moisture barrier than the pure HPMC film. All Sh-HPMC-CFs had better thermal stability than the pure HPMC film and its thermal stability increased as shellac concentration increased.

However, defining the network structure in a microbial community is very challenging due to their extremely high diversity and as-yet uncultivated status. Although recent advance of metagenomic technologies, such as high throughout sequencing and functional gene arrays, provide revolutionary tools for analyzing microbial community structure, it is still difficult to examine network interactions in a microbial community based on high-throughput metagenomics data.Results: Here, we describe a novel mathematical and bioinformatics framework to construct ecological association networks named molecular ecological networks (MENs) through Random Matrix Theory (RMT)-based methods. Compared to other network construction methods, this approach is remarkable in that the network is automatically defined and robust to noise, thus providing excellent solutions to several common issues associated with high-throughput metagenomics data. We applied it to determine the network structure of microbial communities subjected to long-term experimental warming based on pyrosequencing data of 16 S rRNA genes. We showed that the constructed MENs under both warming and unwarming conditions exhibited topological features of scale free, small world and modularity, which were consistent with previously described molecular ecological networks. Eigengene analysis indicated that the eigengenes represented the module profiles relatively well. In consistency with many other studies, several major environmental traits including temperature and soil pH were found to be important in determining network interactions in the microbial communities examined. To facilitate its application by the scientific community, all these methods and statistical tools have been integrated into a comprehensive Molecular Ecological Network Analysis Pipeline (MENAP), which is open-accessible now (http://ieg2.ou.edu/MENA).Conclusions: The RMT-based molecular ecological network analysis provides powerful tools to elucidate network interactions in microbial communities and their responses to environmental changes, which are fundamentally important for research in microbial ecology and environmental microbiology.									58	11	0	53	0	69			1471-2105			WOS:000308070200001	22646978

Using EDC and Sulfo-NHS, terminal carboxyl groups of N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe p-nitroanilide, a cleavable chromogen, were conjugated to primary amines of a hydrated poly(HEMA)-based hydrogel. Hydrogel disks were incubated in buffered Cht causing enzyme-mediated cleavage of the peptide and concomitant release of the chromophore for monitoring. To investigate substrate loading and the effects of hydrogel morphology on the system, the concentration of the amino groups (5, 10, 20, and 30 mol%) and the cross-linked density (1, 5, 7, 9 and 12 mol%) were independently varied. Loading-Release Efficiency of the chromogen was shown to exhibit a positive relation to increasing amino groups (AEMA). The release rates demonstrated a negative relation to increasing cross-linked density attributed to decreasing void fractions and increasing tortuosities. The diffusion coefficient of Cht, D-0,D-Cht, was determined to be 6.9 +/- 0.5x10(-7) cm(2) s(-1), and the range of D-eff of Cht for 1 to 12 mol% TEGDA was determined to be 6.9x10(-8) to 0.1x10(-8) cm(2) s(-1). We show how these parameters may be optimized and used to achieve programmed release rates in engineered bio-responsive systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

Climate change will extend growing seasons if temperature cues predominate, but photoperiod-controlled species will show limited responsiveness to warming. We show that photoperiod explains more seasonal variation in photosynthetic activity across 23 tree species than temperature. Although leaves remain green, photosynthetic capacity peaks just after summer solstice and declines with decreasing photoperiod, before air temperatures peak. In support of these findings, saplings grown at constant temperature but exposed to an extended photoperiod maintained high photosynthetic capacity, but photosynthetic activity declined in saplings experiencing a naturally shortening photoperiod; leaves remained equally green in both treatments. Incorporating a photoperiodic correction of photosynthetic physiology into a global-scale terrestrial carbon-cycle model significantly improves predictions of seasonal atmospheric CO2 cycling, demonstrating the benefit of such a function in coupled climate system models. Accounting for photo-period-induced seasonality in photosynthetic parameters reduces modeled global gross primary production 2.5% (similar to 4 PgC y(-1)), resulting in a >3% (similar to 2 PgC y(-1)) decrease of net primary production. Such a correction is also needed in models estimating current carbon uptake based on remotely sensed greenness. Photoperiod-associated declines in photosynthetic capacity could limit autumn carbon gain in forests, even if warming delays leaf senescence.									65	3	0	50	0	67			0027-8424			WOS:000304881700054	22586103	
J	Battiato, Ilenia								Self-similarity in coupled Brinkman/Navier-Stokes flows								JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS				699				94	114		10.1017/jfm.2012.85			MAY 25 2012	2012	In this paper we derive self-similar solutions of flows through both a porous medium and a pure fluid. Self-similar filtration velocity and hydrodynamic shear profiles are obtained by means of asymptotic analysis in the limit of infinitely small permeability, and for both laminar and turbulent regimes over the porous medium. We show that a spatial length scale, related to the porous layer thickness, naturally emerges from the limiting process and suggests a more formal definition of thick and thin porous media. We finally specialize the analysis to porous media constituted of patterned cylindrical obstacles, which can freely deflect under the aerodynamic shear exerted by the fluid flowing through and over the forest. A self-similar solution for the bending profile of the elastic cylindrical obstacles is obtained as intermediate asymptotics, and applied to carbon nanotube (CNT) forests' response to aerodynamic stresses. This self-similar solution is successfully used to estimate flexural rigidity of CNTs by linear fit of appropriately rescaled maximum deflection and average velocity measurements.									11	0	0	0	0	11			0022-1120	1469-7645		WOS:000303833300004

In this paper, we apply the results to nighttime thermospheric observations of a GW over Alaska on 9-10 January 2010. Using a vertically-pointed Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) at Poker Flat that measured vertical wind perturbations (w') and two FPIs that measured the line-of-sight (LOS) velocities in four common volumes, we inferred a GW ground-based period similar to 32.7 +/- 0.3 min, horizontal wavelength lambda(H) = 1094 +/- 408 km, horizontal ground-based phase speed c(H) similar to 560 +/- 210 m/s, and propagation azimuth theta similar to 33.5 +/- 15.8 degrees east-of-north. We compared the phase shifts and amplitude ratios of this GW with that predicted by the GW dissipative polarization relations derived in the companion paper, enabled by the ability of the FPIs to measure fundamental GW parameters (wind and temperature perturbations). We find that GWs with lambda(H) similar to 700-1100 km, lambda(z) similar to -500 to -350 km, theta similar to 15 to 50 degrees, and c(H) similar to 350-560 m/s agree with the observations if the primary contribution to the 630-nm emission was near the upper portion of that layer. The source of GW was likely thermospheric given the large intrinsic phase speed of the wave. Possible sources are discussed, the most likely of which are related to the onset of auroral activity near the time that the wave was initially observed.									10	0	0	0	0	10			2169-9380	2169-9402		WOS:000304586400003

However, the biodistribution of nanoparticles following in vivo administration is often unknown, and concerns have been raised regarding potential toxicity. Using poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (PGMA) nanoparticles coated with polyethylenimine (PEI) and containing superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent and rhodamine B as a fluorophore, whole animal MRI and fluorescence analyses are used to demonstrate that these nanoparticles (NP) remain close to the site of injection into a partial injury of the optic nerve, a CNS white matter tract. In addition, some of these NP enter axons and are transported to parent neuronal somata. NP also remain in the eye following intravitreal injection, a non-injury model. Considerable infiltration of activated microglia/macrophages occurs in both models. Using magnetic concentration and fluorescence visualization of tissue homogenates, no dissemination of the NP into peripheral tissues is observed. Histopathological analysis reveals no toxicity in organs other than at the injection sites. Multifunctional nanoparticles may be a useful mechanism to deliver therapeutic agents to the injury site and somata of injured CNS neurons and thus may be of therapeutic value following brain or spinal cord trauma.									21	2	0	10	0	21			1613-6810			WOS:000304001000015	22411702

Widely used in animal studies, there is increasing emphasis on their use in diabetes care and management, the management of trauma-associated hemorrhage and in critical care monitoring by intensivists in the ICU. These frontier opportunities demand continuous indwelling performance for up to several years, well in excess of the currently approved seven days. This review outlines the many challenges to successful deployment of chronically implantable amperometric enzyme biosensors and emphasizes the emerging technological approaches in their continued development. The foreign body response plays a prominent role in implantable biotransducer failure. Topics considering the approaches to mitigate the inflammatory response, use of biomimetic chemistries, nanostructured topographies, drug eluting constructs, and tissue-to-device interface modulus matching are reviewed. Similarly, factors that influence biotransducer performance such as enzyme stability, substrate interference, mediator selection and calibration are reviewed. For the biosensor system, the opportunities and challenges of integration, guided by footprint requirements, the limitations of mixed signal electronics, and power requirements, has produced three systems approaches. The potential is great. However, integration along the multiple length scales needed to address fundamental issues and integration across the diverse disciplines needed to achieve success of these highly integrated systems, continues to be a challenge in the development and deployment of implantable amperometric enzyme biosensor systems.

However, this is not an easy task due to the irregular shape of biological entities and the presence of water and mobile ions.Results: Here we report a comprehensive suite for the well-known Poisson-Boltzmann solver, DelPhi, enriched with additional features to facilitate DelPhi usage. The suite allows for easy download of both DelPhi executable files and source code along with a makefile for local installations. The users can obtain the DelPhi manual and parameter files required for the corresponding investigation. Non-experienced researchers can download examples containing all necessary data to carry out DelPhi runs on a set of selected examples illustrating various DelPhi features and demonstrating DelPhi's accuracy against analytical solutions.Conclusions: DelPhi suite offers not only the DelPhi executable and sources files, examples and parameter files, but also provides links to third party developed resources either utilizing DelPhi or providing plugins for DelPhi.

Interoceptive awareness has been primarily assessed via measuring the sensitivity for ones cardiac signals ("cardiac awareness'') which can be non-invasively measured by heartbeat perception tasks. It is an open question whether cardiac awareness is related to the sensitivity for other bodily, visceral functions. This study investigated the relationship between cardiac awareness and the sensitivity for gastric functions in healthy female persons by using non-invasive methods. Heartbeat perception as a measure for cardiac awareness was assessed by a heartbeat tracking task and gastric sensitivity was assessed by a water load test. Gastric myoelectrical activity was measured by electrogastrography (EGG) and subjective feelings of fullness, valence, arousal and nausea were assessed. The results show that cardiac awareness was inversely correlated with ingested water volume and with normogastric activity after water load. However, persons with good and poor cardiac awareness did not differ in their subjective ratings of fullness, nausea and affective feelings after drinking. This suggests that good heartbeat perceivers ingested less water because they subjectively felt more intense signals of fullness during this lower amount of water intake compared to poor heartbeat perceivers who ingested more water until feeling the same signs of fullness. These findings demonstrate that cardiac awareness is related to greater sensitivity for gastric functions, suggesting that there is a general sensitivity for interoceptive processes across the gastric and cardiac modality.									64	0	0	31	0	64			1932-6203			WOS:000305338200036	22606278

The surface properties of undoped and BMIM-PF6 doped systems were analyzed by water contact angle (WCA) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). BMIM-PF6 doped BP-PFCB surfaces prepared by spin casting showed a WCA of 90 degrees while non-woven electrospun surfaces with the same BMIM-PF6 concentration showed high degree of hydrophobicity with a WCA greater than 150 degrees. Morphologies of the electrospun surfaces were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The surface composition was analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) and attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR).

As expected, male students outgained females in traditionally taught sections as well as sections that incorporated interactive engagement (IE) techniques. In two of the IE course sections, however, the gains of female students were comparable to those of male students. Classroom observations of the course sections involved were made over an extended period. In this paper, we characterize the observed instructor-student interactions using a framework from educational psychology referred to as wise schooling. Results suggest that instructor practices affect differential learning, and that wise schooling techniques may constitute an effective strategy for promoting gender equity in the physics classroom.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1554-9178			WOS:000303664800001

Using data on prisoners incarcerated in Pennsylvania's nineteenth-century prisons, we show that prisoners were short relative to the contemporary population. Then, using Weibull continuous-time duration econometric models, we show that age at entry into criminal activity was negatively associated with an individual's height after controlling for several individual characteristics. The results are consistent with recent research showing that shorter individuals face less attractive legitimate labor market opportunities because lower stature is associated with lower cognitive ability and because of general discrimination against shorter people.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0022-2186			WOS:000311211200006

The scheduler and MAC protocol are designed to prevent the co-site interference problem that arises in some types of nodes employing directional antennas. It is shown that the presence of nodes with directional antennas exacerbates the vulnerability of the network to the receiver blocking problem. A modification of the MAC protocol is presented that mitigates the receiver blocking problem, and it is shown to improve the performance of a network that includes nodes with directional antennas.

IRRIGATION AND NITROGEN IMPACT ON BERMUDAGRASS YIELD RESPONSE IN THE SOUTHEASTERN COASTAL PLAIN								TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE				55	3			969	978					MAY-JUN 2012	2012	In the southeastern region of the US., the cattle industry has a critical need for sustainable hay production. Yet this production is threatened by frequent short-term regional drought. This drought threat can be mitigated by properly managed irrigation. In this study on Tifton 85 bermudagrass, irrigation management, nitrogen fertility levels, and harvest interval were evaluated for their impact on hay quality and yield. The experimental treatments were arrayed in a split-plot design with harvest interval as the main treatment; irrigation by nitrogen (N) levels were the subplots. Treatments had four replicates and were repeated for two years. The optimal irrigation rate was set to maintain soil water potentials below -30 kPa. When needed, the full irrigation treatment received a 12.5 min irrigation application. The reduced irrigation treatments received water at rates of 0%, 33%, and 66% of the full irrigation rate. In addition, each irrigation treatment had nitrogen rates of 168, 336, and 504 kg N ha(-1). The irrigation and nitrogen treatments were harvested at four-week or eight-week intervals. Total harvests per year ranged from three to six. Over both years and for all harvests, there was no irrigation-nitrogen interaction for hay yield. Over all harvests, nitrogen significantly increased bermudagrass hay yield, nutrient concentrations, and forage quality. Forage quality was higher for the four-week harvest interval. Throughout the study forage quality was maintained within desired industry standards. When irrigation was required, it significantly increased hay yield. During these periods, the four-week and eight-week 100% irrigation treatments yielded 612 and 1600 kg ha(-1) greater, respectively, than the non-irrigated treatments. The four-week harvest interval was more sensitive to irrigation. Additionally, we observed a linear relationship between non-irrigated bermudagrass hay yields and average soil water potential. As soil water was depleted, non-irrigated hay yields decreased 31 kg ha(-1) per kPa. Timely supplemental irrigation to maintain soil water potentials above -30 kPa can increase bermudagrass yields. Thus, irrigation management should be critically assessed for its potential role in sustaining hay production in the southeastern Coastal Plain.									4	0	0	3	0	4			2151-0032			WOS:000306639900022

SYNTHESES, CHARACTERIZATION, AND EVALUATION OF NI-OLIVINE CATALYSTS FOR TOLUENE OXIDATION								TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE				55	3			1013	1024					MAY-JUN 2012	2012	This research focused on advanced oxidation of toluene by evaluating Ni-olivine catalysts in combination with ozone. Specifically, our objectives were to: (1) synthesize catalysts via electroless plating (ELP) and thermal impregnation (TI) techniques to impregnate nickel onto the olivine surface; (2) characterize Ni-olivine catalysts by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller specific surface area, electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to understanding the mechanisms of toluene oxidation; (3) determine the catalytic activity of the newly synthesized Ni-olivine catalysts in the oxidation of toluene; and (4) evaluate the influence of varying toluene and ozone concentrations on Ni-olivine oxidation efficiencies. Testing was performed in a continuous packed bed reactor (200 degrees C). Toluene (200 to 600 ppmv) and ozone (70 to 800 ppmv) were injected into the heated reactor, while inlet and outlet concentrations were measured using gas chromatography. Results indicated that 90% of toluene was oxidized within a 1 s residence time using ELP and TI catalyst synthesis techniques and 70 ppmv ozone. Microscopic and spectroscopic analyses revealed porous structures and a nickel film uniformly coating the electroless plated olivine surface, mostly comprised of Ni-P-O, while the thermally impregnated Ni-olivine possessed sparingly deposited Ni2O3 compounds on the surface. An increase in ozone concentrations increased toluene oxidation efficiencies, whereas an increase in toluene concentrations temporarily decreased toluene oxidation efficiencies. Knowledge obtained from this research can be used for synthesizing advanced catalysts for toluene oxidation at significantly lower temperature.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2151-0032	2151-0040		WOS:000306639900027

A Matter of Balance/Volunteer Lay Leader Model is an evidence-based program designed to address fear of falling. The objective of this study was to describe implementation, dissemination, and outcomes of this program in 3 regions of South Carolina with a predominantly African American and largely underserved population.MethodsWe developed partnerships throughout the state, organized master and lay leader trainings, and documented numbers of lay leaders, programs offered, demographic characteristics of participants, program fidelity, and attendance. Outcome measures were self-reported confidence to prevent and manage falls and a quantitative measure of functional mobility. Both measures were assessed at baseline and after program completion.ResultsOlder adults (N = 235) attended 18 classes at 16 sites. Barriers to implementation were program teams' limited familiarity with the concept of evidence-based programs and the importance of adhering to program content. Facilitators were state-level leadership and a history of state, regional, and local groups collaborating successfully on other projects. Outcomes indicated greater confidence in managing falls and carrying out activities of daily living. Mobility improved significantly, suggesting a reduced risk for falls.ConclusionEvidence-based programs such as A Matter of Balance/Volunteer Lay Leader Model can be successfully disseminated in underserved areas. Outcomes indicate that participation in fall prevention programs can benefit groups of predominantly African American older adults.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1545-1151			WOS:000306648100010		
J	Goethals, P. L.; Cho, B. R.								The optimal process mean problem: Integrating predictability and profitability into an experimental factor space								COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING				62	4			851	869		10.1016/j.cie.2011.11.032			MAY 2012	2012	For complex manufacturing systems, process or product optimization can be instrumental in achieving a significant economic advantage. To reduce costs associated with product non-conformance or excessive waste, engineers often identify the most critical quality characteristics and then use methods to obtain their ideal parameter settings. The optimal process mean problem is one such statistical method; it begins with the assumption of the characteristic parameters, whereby the ideal settings are determined based upon the tradeoff among various processing costs. Unfortunately, however, the ideal parameter settings for a characteristic mean can be unpredictable, as it is directly influenced by changes in the process variability, tolerance, and cost structure. In this paper, a method is proposed that relates the optimal process mean to the ideal settings through experimental design. With the method, one may gain greater predictability of the new optimal process mean when the process conditions are altered. The methodology is illustrated for a process with multiple mixed quality characteristics; such an optimal process mean problem is seldom treated in the literature.

Endotoxin tolerance and priming elicited by macrophages are classic examples of the complex adaptation of innate immune cells. Upon repetitive exposures to different doses of bacterial endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) or other stimulants, macrophages show either suppressed or augmented inflammatory responses compared to a single exposure to the stimulant. Endotoxin tolerance and priming are critically involved in both immune homeostasis and the pathogenesis of diverse inflammatory diseases. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood. By means of a computational search through the parameter space of a coarse-grained three-node network with a two-stage Metropolis sampling approach, we enumerated all the network topologies that can generate priming or tolerance. We discovered three major mechanisms for priming (pathway synergy, suppressor deactivation, activator induction) and one for tolerance (inhibitor persistence). These results not only explain existing experimental observations, but also reveal intriguing test scenarios for future experimental studies to clarify mechanisms of endotoxin priming and tolerance.									19	1	0	14	0	19			1553-734X	1553-7358		WOS:000305964600033	22615556

At temperatures above 180 degrees C and heating times over 2 h there was a significantly increased TFA content, which increased further at higher temperatures. The amounts of trans C18:1 and trans C18:2 increased from 0.64 and 9.0 to 7.86 and 65.48 mg/g after heating at 260 degrees C for 12 h, while the total amount of TFA increased from 9.64 to 73.34 mg/g. However, the contents of linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid under the same conditions reduced from 460.3 and 7.4 to 209.8 and 1.8 mg/g, respectively. These results show that heating can significantly induce cis to trans isomerization of unsaturated triglycerides, particularly at high temperatures.									4	2	0	3	0	6			0003-021X			WOS:000305293000010		
J	Li, Xingpeng; Kerrigan, Julia; Chai, Wenxuan; Schnabel, Guido								Botrytis caroliniana, a new species isolated from blackberry in South Carolina								MYCOLOGIA				104	3			650	658		10.3852/11-218			MAY-JUN 2012	2012	Blackberry fruits symptomatic for gray mold were collected from three commercial blackberry fields in northwestern South Carolina. Single-spore isolates were generated and two distinct phenotypes were discovered in each location; one sporulated on PDA and one did not. One isolate of each phenotype and location (six isolates total) were selected for in depth molecular and morphological characterization. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH), heat-shock protein 60 (HSP60) and DNA-dependent RNA polymerase subunit II (RPB2) coding sequence alignment revealed Botrytis cinerea as the sporulating phenotype and a new yet undescribed species as the non-sporulating phenotype. The new Botrytis sp., described herein as Botrytis caroliniana, was most closely related genetically to B. fabiopsis and B. galanthina, the causal agents of gray mold disease of broad bean and snowdrop, respectively. It produces smaller conidia than either B. fabiopsis or B. galanthina, and sequence analysis of genes encoding necrosis and ethylene-inducing proteins (NEPs) also indicated that the Botrytis isolates represent a separate and distinct species. The new species is pathogenic on blackberry fruits and broad bean leaves, which distinguishes it further from B. galanthina. The new species formed white to pale gray colonies with short, tufted aerial mycelium and produced black sclerotia on PDA at 20 C. To our knowledge this is only the third Botrytis species discovered to cause disease on blackberry in the United States.									12	1	0	12	0	13			0027-5514			WOS:000305497800007	22314589

The reduction of forming load was formulated previously assuming that a part of the electrical energy input is dissipated into heat, thus producing thermal softening of the material, while the remaining component directly aids the plastic deformation. The fraction of electrical energy applied, which assists the deformation process compared to the total amount of electrical energy, is given by the electroplastic effect coefficient.The objective of the current research is to investigate the complex effect of the electricity applied during deformation, and to establish a methodology for quantifying the electroplastic effect coefficient. Temperature behavior is observed for varying levels of deformation and previous cold work. Results are used to refine the understanding of the electroplastic effect coefficient, and a new relationship, in the form of a power law, is derived. This model is validated under independent experiments in Grade 2 (commercially pure) and Grade 5 (Ti-6Al-4V) titanium.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0954-4054			WOS:000305482500001		
J	Miller, Kristen P.; Gowtham, Yogender Kumar; Henson, J. Michael; Harcum, Sarah W.								Xylose isomerase improves growth and ethanol production rates from biomass sugars for both Saccharomyces pastorianus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae								BIOTECHNOLOGY PROGRESS				28	3			669	680		10.1002/btpr.1535			MAY-JUN 2012	2012	The demand for biofuel ethanol made from clean, renewable nonfood sources is growing. Cellulosic biomass, such as switch grass (Panicum virgatum L.), is an alternative feedstock for ethanol production; however, cellulosic feedstock hydrolysates contain high levels of xylose, which needs to be converted to ethanol to meet economic feasibility. In this study, the effects of xylose isomerase on cell growth and ethanol production from biomass sugars representative of switch grass were investigated using low cell density cultures. The lager yeast species Saccharomyces pastorianus was grown with immobilized xylose isomerase in the fermentation step to determine the impact of the glucose and xylose concentrations on the ethanol production rates. Ethanol production rates were improved due to xylose isomerase; however, the positive effect was not due solely to the conversion of xylose to xylulose. Xylose isomerase also has glucose isomerase activity, so to better understand the impact of the xylose isomerase on S. pastorianus, growth and ethanol production were examined in cultures provided fructose as the sole carbon. It was observed that growth and ethanol production rates were higher for the fructose cultures with xylose isomerase even in the absence of xylose. To determine whether the positive effects of xylose isomerase extended to other yeast species, a side-by-side comparison of S. pastorianus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae was conducted. These comparisons demonstrated that the xylose isomerase increased ethanol productivity for both the yeast species by increasing the glucose consumption rate. These results suggest that xylose isomerase can contribute to improved ethanol productivity, even without significant xylose conversion. (C) 2012 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

To determine the effect of moderate levels of refractive blur and simulated cataracts on nighttime pedestrian conspicuity in the presence and absence of headlamp glare.METHODS. The ability to recognize pedestrians at night was measured in 28 young adults (M = 27.6 years) under three visual conditions: normal vision, refractive blur, and simulated cataracts; mean acuity was 20/40 or better in all conditions. Pedestrian recognition distances were recorded while participants drove an instrumented vehicle along a closed road course at night. Pedestrians wore one of three clothing conditions and oncoming headlamps were present for 16 participants and absent for 12 participants.RESULTS. Simulated visual impairment and glare significantly reduced the frequency with which drivers recognized pedestrians and the distance at which the drivers first recognized them. Simulated cataracts were significantly more disruptive than blur even though photopic visual acuity levels were matched. With normal vision, drivers responded to pedestrians at 3.6- and 5.5-fold longer distances on average than for the blur or cataract conditions, respectively. Even in the presence of visual impairment and glare, pedestrians were recognized more often and at longer distances when they wore a "biological motion" reflective clothing configuration than when they wore a reflective vest or black clothing.CONCLUSIONS. Drivers' ability to recognize pedestrians at night is degraded by common visual impairments, even when the drivers' mean visual acuity meets licensing requirements. To maximize drivers' ability to see pedestrians, drivers should wear their optimum optical correction, and cataract surgery should be performed early enough to avoid potentially dangerous reductions in visual performance.

Effects of roof and rainwater characteristics on copper concentrations in roof runoff								ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT				184	5			2797	2804		10.1007/s10661-011-2152-1			MAY 2012	2012	Copper sheeting is a common roofing material used in many parts of the world. However, copper dissolved from roof sheeting represents a source of copper ions to watersheds. Researchers have studied and recently developed a simple and efficient model to predict copper runoff rates. Important input parameters include precipitation amount, rain pH, and roof angle. We hypothesized that the length of a roof also positively correlates with copper concentration (thus, runoff rates) on the basis that runoff concentrations should positively correlate with contact time between acidic rain and the copper sheet. In this study, a novel system was designed to test and model the effects of roof length (length of roof from crown to the drip edge) on runoff copper concentrations relative to rain pH and roof angle. The system consisted of a flat-bottom copper trough mounted on an apparatus that allowed run length and slope to be varied. Water of known chemistry was trickled down the trough at a constant rate and sampled at the bottom. Consistent with other studies, as pH of the synthetic rainwater decreased, runoff copper concentrations increased. At all pH values tested, these results indicated that run length was more important in explaining variability in copper concentrations than was the roof slope. The regression equation with log-transformed data (R (2) = 0.873) accounted for slightly more variability than the equation with untransformed data (R (2) = 0.834). In log-transformed data, roof angle was not significant in predicting copper concentrations.									4	0	0	4	0	4			0167-6369			WOS:000303381300015	21713491

Healthcare informatics researchers believe that such systems hold great promise for improving the efficiency of medical organizations. We surveyed 216 medical practice adopters of electronic purchasing, to assess the post-adoption benefits following system assimilation. Results showed that Internet-based purchasing applications had a positive impact on both claims management and operational performance outcomes. Moreover, we found that compatibility, facilitating conditions, the IT infrastructure, and preference item purchasing were necessary antecedents to effective Internet-based purchasing application assimilation.

The effects of PS and growth temperature on the structural and the optical properties of the ZnO thin films were investigated by using atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and photoluminescence (PL). A higher intensity and a narrower full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the ZnO (002) diffraction peak were observed from the ZnO thin films grown on PS, indicating improved crystal quality. For the ZnO thin films grown on Si, the optical properties were gradually enhanced as the growth temperature was increased. However, the structural and the optical properties of the ZnO thin films grown on PS exhibited the largest improvement at a growth temperature of 350 A degrees C. The structural and the optical properties of the ZnO thin films, compared with the ZnO thin films grown on Si, were improved by introducing PS, and the optimum growth temperature was decreased.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0374-4884			WOS:000304627500019

The seed layers were post-heated at various temperatures ranging from 350 to 500 A degrees C. The effects of the post-heat-treatment temperature for the seed layers on the structural and the optical properties of the ZnO nanostructures were investigated by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and photoluminescence (PL). The seed layers postheated at temperatures above 450 A degrees C exhibited mountain-chain-like structures with voids while the surfaces of the ones post-heated at relatively lower temperatures showed a smooth morphology with high density. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the ZnO (002) diffraction peak of the seed layers decreased with increasing post-heat temperature, which indicates that the crystal quality of the seed layers was enhanced as the post-heat temperature was increased. The uniformity and the density of the ZnO nanostructures were affected by the uniformity and the morphology of the seed layers. In addition, the highest c-axis preferred orientation, the narrowest FWHM of the ZnO (002) diffraction peak, and the largest average grain size were shown in the ZnO nanostructures grown on the seed layers post-heated at a temperature of 400 A degrees C. Moreover, the intensity of the deep-level emission peak in the PL spectra increased with increasing post-heat temperature.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0374-4884			WOS:000304627500023

Of the structures of three polymorphs of CsThF5 one is described in space group P4/nmm with a = 5.7358(8) and c = 7.4048(15) and two in the space group P2(1)/c: one with a = 8.3600(17), b = 7.5780(15), c = 8.9912(18), beta = 116.69(3) and the other with a = 8.4196(17), b = 14.645(3), c = 8.5017(17), beta = 102.67(3). Comparison of these materials was made based on their structures and synthesis conditions. The formation of these species and other previously reported metal fluoride species in hydrothermal fluids appears to be dependent upon the concentration of the alkali fluoride mineralizer, pressure, temperature, and reaction time. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) studies show that all of the different phases of cesium thorium fluoride transition into the same monoclinic phase of CsThF5 and eventually into the orthorhombic phase of CsTh3F13.

J	Hu, Mengxuan; Wiatrak, Pawel								Effect of Planting Date on Soybean Growth, Yield, and Grain Quality: Review								AGRONOMY JOURNAL				104	3			785	790					MAY-JUN 2012	2012	Delayed planting date and unfavorable environmental conditions have a negative effect on soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] growth, development, and yield. Changes in photoperiod, temperature, and precipitation with delayed planting affect the duration ofvegetative and reproductive stages, number of branches and pods, plant height, leaf area index (LAI), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and hence the grain yield. Delayed planting can also affect the soybean seed quality by changing the oil and protein content. Environmental factors like extremely high temperature and drought stress, which are often associated with delayed planting, have also a negative effect on plant development and yield. Compared to optimum air temperature, reduction in photosynthetic rate during heat stress decreases seed set and size, and seed yield. Drought stress during reproductive stages reduces carbon dioxide exchange rate (CER), photosynthesis, sugar production, and flow of metabolites to the expanding cells, which increases flower and pod abortion and decreases vegetative growth, duration of the seed filling stage, seed number, and seed size. Generally, the combined effect of photoperiod, temperature, and precipitation with delayed planting most likely contributes to decreased duration of vegetative and reproductive growth stages, reduced photosynthesis and plant growth, and therefore significant reduction in grain yield of soybean.									12	0	0	9	3	13			0002-1962			WOS:000304233600025

Polysaccharides of corn silk (POCS), which were extracted by distilled water and precipitated by 80% ethanol solution, were evaluated for its anti-diabetic effect on streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. The results demonstrated that daily treatment with 100-500 mg/kg body weight of POCS on the diabetic rats could not only lead a significant decrease on the animal's blood glucose (BG) level, but also reduce the serum lipid level including total cholesterol (TC) and total triglyceride (TG) after determination. The oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was also performed to evaluate hypoglycemic effects. Through the measurements of measuring autonomic activity times and rolling stick times, the results also exhibited that the animals had been depressed by dimethyl-biguanide, but protected by the POCS. The POCS showed good antidepressant activity and lengthened remarkably the activity time during the autonomic activities test and exhibited a dose dependent activity. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In each experiment, students designed either a burrito folder or a pet feeder. The first experiment used two rectangular morphological charts; one vertically oriented with more functions and one horizontally oriented with more means. The second experiment used four morphological charts, two charts similar to the first experiment and two nearly square with a similar number of functions and means. Participants from similar populations were enrolled and similar protocols were followed to align the results for comparison. A comparison of the significant aspects of each experiment emphasized the problem, the participants, the morphological charts employed, and the experimental procedures. Furthermore, a critique of the two experiments is provided and joint conclusions are drawn. Experimental results suggest that reducing information in the morphological charts, such as the number of functions, enhances the likelihood for developing higher quality integrated concept solutions. While accurate for most configurations, this benefit is limited in that the largest sized chart failed to show worse results compared with smaller counterparts.

Isolating Petroleum Pitch Oligomers via Semi-continuous Supercritical Extraction								ENERGY & FUELS				26	5			2721	2726		10.1021/ef201456q			MAY 2012	2012	Dense-gas/supercritical extraction (DGE/SCE) was used for the fractionation of a representative petroleum pitch, M-50, into its oligomeric constituents using toluene as the extractive solvent. A small, pilot-scale column was operated in the semi-continuous/semi-batch mode under a linear positive temperature gradient of 380-330 degrees C from the top to the bottom of the column and over a pressure range of 15-75 bar. This DGE column was used to produce high-purity monomer, dimer, and trimer fractions of M-50 suitable for use as molecular standards for petroleum pitches and for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) oligomers. During the experimental runs, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS) was used to monitor in real time the progress of the separation (and oligomeric purity) by performing rapid analyses of the molecular-weight distributions (MWDs) of the overhead fractions being collected. These real-time analyses provided us with the ability to fine-tune in situ the operating conditions according to the separation desired. The separation of petroleum pitches and other heavy fossil fuels into narrow molecular-weight fractions by semi-continuous DGE has proven to be an invaluable first step in the isolation and structural characterization of the individual species present in these multi-component, poorly defined systems. Furthermore, these molecular standards are also suitable for quantitative analysis.					12th International Conference on Petroleum Phase Behavior and Fouling12th International Conference on Petroleum Phase Behavior and Fouling	JUL 10-14, 2011JUL 10-14, 2011		London, ENGLANDLondon, ENGLAND	5	0	0	0	0	5			0887-0624	1520-5029		WOS:000304073000022

TRIENNIAL LACTATION SYMPOSIUM: Bovine mammary epithelial cell lineages and parenchymal development								JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE				90	5			1666	1673		10.2527/jas.2011-4671			MAY 2012	2012	Mammary development proceeds from an aggregation of cells in the ventral ectoderm to the establishment of an elaborate tree of alveoli, ducts, and cisternae. However, despite abundant data on endocrine regulation of ruminant mammary growth, we know comparatively little about cell lineages, expression of differentiation markers, and plasticity in mammary cell phenotype. Histologic analyses have revealed cell populations with distinct histochemical profiles, but functional assessment of cell populations during development has been limited to analysis of proliferation and frequency estimations of morphotypes. The lack of transplantation models, limited availability of validated antibodies with reactivity to bovine antigens, and similar technical challenges have generally hindered the pace of discovery, but the application of new technologies such as laser microdissection, transcriptional profiling, and multispectral image analysis are yielding important clues into bovine mammary cell ontogeny and developmental regulation. Our analyses have shown that prepubertal ovariectomy affects epithelial architecture, increases the proportion of cells expressing the estrogen receptor, and increases myoepithelial cell development, all concomitant with a dramatic reduction in the mass of parenchymal tissue. Our observations point to a dual role for ovarian secretions in the control of not only the rate of epithelial development, but also the nature of the parenchymal development. The balance of stimulus and inhibition pathways cooperatively regulates mammary growth. The increased reliance on objective staining analyses and quantitative approaches will ensure broader repeatability, application, and extension of the findings regarding the impact of the ovary and other regulatory entities and factors. Advances in understanding the ontogeny of mammary epithelial cells, coupled with established and increasing knowledge of endocrine factors affecting mammary development, may yield intervention strategies to improve dairy profitability.									5	0	0	3	0	5			0021-8812	1525-3163		WOS:000303880200031	22100590

In this study, the slip circle method is employed to investigate how the required safety-factor against basal heave was affected by spatial variability in the context of reliability-based design. The nonstationary random field model is adopted to model spatial variability of undrained shear strength. Results show that the required safety-factor obtained with the consideration of spatial variability is much smaller than that without the consideration. Parametric studies show that the vertical scale of fluctuation has a significant influence on the required safety-factor: the longer the scale of fluctuation, the larger the required safety-factor. For target failure probabilities of 0.01 and 0.001, the corresponding required safety factors are in the ranges of 1.4-1.9 and 1.6-2.4, respectively, for the average value of vertical scale of fluctuation of 2.5 m. Design charts are provided for the ease of implementation, and an example of reliability-based design for basal stability is given for demonstration.DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)GT.1943-5606.0000626.

The authors present the effect of using 802.11 b/g wireless technology on real-time traffic surveillance systems. Although numerous studies have focused on studying the quality requirements for video streaming using a simulation environment, there is limited information on such performance in a real world environment. This study analyzed key video quality parameters, including packet jitter and packet rate, suggesting necessary guidelines for the transportation agency personnel to use when evaluating and selecting surveillance and communication tools. Study of the packet jitter showed that jitter and skipped video are strongly correlated with one another. Moreover, tolerated jitter ranges were identified that would ensure smooth traffic surveillance video. Findings indicated that to avoid jitter-related problems and to minimize the discontinuity of surveillance video, a 1-s play-out buffer size should be added to traffic surveillance communication systems. Analysis of packet rate suggested that an average value of 23 packets/s can ensure smooth video continuity for traffic surveillance applications. Further analysis of multiple surveillance videos streaming simultaneously revealed the importance of knowing the available bandwidth for video transmission. Multiple video streaming over a wireless network indicated that the available bandwidth plays an important role in deciding the perceptual quality of the video.

Treatment recommendations are limited by a lack of comparative outcomes data.Methods: We identified all infants. 120 days of age with positive blood, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid cultures for Candida species who received amphotericin B deoxycholate, fluconazole, amphotericin B lipid products, or combination therapy admitted to one of 192 neonatal intensive care units in the United States between 1997 and 2003. Primary outcome measures included overall mortality and therapeutic failure (combined outcome of duration of infection. 7 days, need for additional antifungal therapy, or death before discharge). We compared outcomes by antifungal therapy using logistic regression, controlling for gestational age, day of life at start of antifungal therapy, delay in therapy, and site of infection.Results: Overall, 138 of 730 (19%) infants died. On multivariable logistic regression, we observed higher overall mortality for infants receiving amphotericin B lipid products compared with infants receiving amphotericin B deoxycholate (odds ratio 1.96 [95% confidence intervals: 1.16, 3.33]; P = 0.01) or fluconazole (odds ratio 2.39 [1.18, 4.83]; P = 0.02).Conclusions: Infants treated with amphotericin B lipid products had higher mortality than infants treated with either amphotericin B deoxycholate or fluconazole. This finding may be related to inadequate penetration of amphotericin B lipid products into the kidneys, inappropriate dosing in premature infants, or unknown differences in acuity of illness in infants treated with amphotericin B lipid products.									19	0	0	10	0	19			0891-3668			WOS:000303730400004	22189522

Large amounts of energy are deposited to ionosphere in the form of expanding exhaust vapors which change the composition and flow velocity. Charge exchange between the neutral exhaust molecules and the background ions (mainly O+) yields energetic ion beams. The rapidly moving pickup ions excite plasma instabilities and yield optical emissions after dissociative recombination with ambient electrons. Line-of-sight techniques for remote measurements rocket burn effects include direct observation of plume optical emissions with ground and satellite cameras, and plume scatter with UHF and higher frequency radars. Long range detection with HF radars is possible if the burns occur in the dense part of the ionosphere. The exhaust vapors initiate plasma turbulence in the ionosphere that can scatter HF radar waves launched from ground transmitters. Solid rocket motors provide particulates that become charged in the ionosphere and may excite dusty plasma instabilities. Hypersonic exhaust flow impacting the ionospheric plasma launches a low-frequency, electromagnetic pulse that is detectable using satellites with electric field booms. If the exhaust cloud itself passes over a satellite, in situ detectors measure increased ion-acoustic wave turbulence, enhanced neutral and plasma densities, elevated ion temperatures, and magnetic field perturbations. All of these techniques can be used for long range observations of plumes in the ionosphere. To demonstrate such long range measurements, several experiments were conducted by the Naval Research Laboratory including the Charged Aerosol Release Experiment, the Shuttle Ionospheric Modification with Pulsed Localized Exhaust experiments, and the Shuttle Exhaust Ionospheric Turbulence Experiments.									17	1	0	0	0	17			0093-3813			WOS:000303889900002

The Criterion-Related Validity of Integrity Tests: An Updated Meta-Analysis								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY				97	3			499	530		10.1037/a0021196			MAY 2012	2012	Integrity tests have become a prominent predictor within the selection literature over the past few decades. However, some researchers have expressed concerns about the criterion-related validity evidence for such tests because of a perceived lack of methodological rigor within this literature, as well as a heavy reliance on unpublished data from test publishers. In response to these concerns, we meta-analyzed 104 studies (representing 134 independent samples), which were authored by a similar proportion of test publishers and non-publishers, whose conduct was consistent with professional standards for test validation, and whose results were relevant to the validity of integrity-specific scales for predicting individual work behavior. Overall mean observed validity estimates and validity estimates corrected for unreliability in the criterion (respectively) were .12 and .15 for job performance, .13 and .16 for training performance, .26 and .32 for counterproductive work behavior, and .07 and .09 for turnover. Although data on restriction of range were sparse, illustrative corrections for indirect range restriction did increase validities slightly (e.g., from .15 to .18 for job performance). Several variables appeared to moderate relations between integrity tests and the criteria. For example, corrected validities for job performance criteria were larger when based on studies authored by integrity test publishers (.27) than when based on studies from non-publishers (.12). In addition, corrected validities for counterproductive work behavior criteria were larger when based on self-reports (.42) than when based on other-reports (.11) or employee records (.15).									37	0	0	1	0	37			0021-9010			WOS:000303967500001	21319880

We reiterate that our research question focused on the criterion-related validity of integrity tests for predicting individual work behavior and that our inclusion criteria flowed from this question. We also reviewed the primary studies we could access from Ones, Viswesvaran, and Schmidt's (1993) meta-analysis of integrity tests and found that only about 30% of the studies met our inclusion criteria. Further, analyses of some of the types of studies we had to exclude revealed potentially inflated validity estimates (e.g., corrected validities as high as .80 for polygraph studies). We also discuss our experience trying to obtain primary studies and other information from authors of Harris et al. (2012) and Ones, Viswesvaran, and Schmidt (2012). In addition, we address concerns raised about certain decisions we made and values we used, and we demonstrate how such concerns would have little or no effect on our results or conclusions. Finally, we discuss some other misconceptions about our meta-analysis, as well as some divergent views about the integrity test literature in general. Overall, we stand by our research question, methods, and results, which suggest that the validity of integrity tests for criteria such as job performance and counterproductive work behavior is weaker than the authors of the critiques appear to believe.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0021-9010			WOS:000303967500004	22582729

Results of the simulations with the new parameterization are compared with those of the classical parameterizations. Comparison with previous results indicates on average an increase of 70% in the drop number concentration and a 15% decrease in rain intensity for the equilibrium drop size distribution (DSD). Furthermore, the drop bounce process is parameterized as a function of drop size based on laboratory experiments for the first time in a microphysical model. Numerical results indicate that drop bounce has a strong influence on the equilibrium DSD, in particular for very small drops (<0.5 mm), leading to an increase of up to 150% in the small drop number concentration (left-hand side of the DSD) when compared to previous modeling results without accounting for bounce effects.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0022-4928			WOS:000303625700005

Yet little is known about the operations and capabilities needed for provision of business-to-business (B2B) e-services. This paper aims to make a contribution toward closing this gap. First, we develop a new construct of B2B e-service capability, a term that captures a generic set of five interrelated and complementary dimensions: (1) e-service recovery, (2) e-customization, (3) ease of navigation, (4) service portfolio comprehensiveness, and (5) information richness. These combined operational abilities are associated with B2B service delivery, including its portal design, technology architecture, and mix of product and service offerings. They are posited to be necessary for delivering effective B2B e-services. We also argue that, both service orientation (SO) and customer receptivity to technology, influence B2B e-service capability. We empirically test a path model using structural equation modeling on a sample of 181 businesses that have deployed B2B e-services. We find that the influence of SO on performance is not direct but rather mediated by the e-service capability, a finding that holds for both goods producers and service providers. We suggest that a firm's SO may mitigate industrial customers' resistance toward conducting business online.									5	0	0	0	1	6			1059-1478			WOS:000303499100003

To understand the role of EMPs on enamel mineralization, calcium phosphate (CaP) growth experiments in both the presence and absence of native rat EMPs in a single diffusion system were conducted. The morphology and organization of formed CaP crystals were examined by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). High-Resolution Transmission Microscopy (HRTEM) and Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED). In the system containing the EMPs, hydroxyapatite (HAP) with hierarchical lamellar nanostructure can be formed and the aligned HAP assembly tightly bundled by 3-4 rod-like nanocrystals like an enamel prism. However, in the absence of EMPs, only a sheet-like structure of octacalcium phosphate (OCP) phase was presented. EMPs promote HAP formation and inhibit the growth of OCP on the (010) plane. It is discussed that the organized Amelogenin/Amorphous Calcium Phosphate might be the precursor to the bundled HAP crystal prism. The study benefits the understanding of biomineralization of tooth enamel. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0928-4931			WOS:000303299300035

Transitional chapter books are geared toward transitional readerschildren in grades 2 through 4 who have outgrown predictable books and other types of easy readers but are not ready for more complex novels. The purpose of this study is to determine what the African American female protagonists depicted in these transitional chapter books value and care about. The study is informed by scholarship and research related to transitional chapter books and representations of African American girlhood. Upon conducting close readings repeatedly of the nine transitional chapter books over a period of several months, it was determined that the following four areas were of importance to the protagonists: solidifying friendships, developing morality, fitting in, and valuing learning. The article concludes with a discussion of the benefits of transitional chapter books written by and about African Americans.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0034-0561			WOS:000303389100007

In the reconstruction process, the individual shares and the secret key K are revealed, hence K is shared once only. In this paper, we firstly give the definition of leakproof secret sharing scheme which is composed of a distribution protocol and a proof protocol, then propose two leakproof secret sharing protocols, a computationally secure protocol and an information-theoretically secure protocol. In our protocols, t or more participants can jointly prove that they hold the secret K by using a multi-prover zero-knowledge argument of knowledge. As a result, the secret K will be shared for as many times as desired. Furthermore, each participant can detect the dealer in the distribution protocol from cheating, and any verifier can prevent non-qualified set of participants in proof protocol from cheating. As an example of the practical impact of our work we use our techniques to construct group identification schemes with zero-knowledge.									3	5	0	0	0	5			1674-733X	1869-1919		WOS:000303426100017

Sodium arsenite represses the expression of myogenin in C2C12 mouse myoblast cells through histone modifications and altered expression of Ezh2, Glp, and Igf-1								TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY				260	3			250	259		10.1016/j.taap.2012.03.002			MAY 1 2012	2012	Arsenic is a toxicant commonly found in water systems and chronic exposure can result in adverse developmental effects including increased neonatal death, stillbirths, and miscarriages, low birth weight, and altered locomotor activity. Previous studies indicate that 20 nM sodium arsenite exposure to C2C12 mouse myocyte cells delayed myoblast differentiation due to reduced myogenin expression, the transcription factor that differentiates myoblasts into myotubes. In this study, several mechanisms by which arsenic could alter myogenin expression were examined. Exposing differentiating C2C12 cells to 20 nM arsenic increased H3K9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) and H3K9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) by 3-fold near the transcription start site of myogenin, which is indicative of increased repressive marks, and reduced H3K9 acetylation (H3K9Ac) by 0.5-fold, indicative of reduced permissive marks. Protein expression of Glp or Ehmt1, a H3-K9 methyltransferase, was also increased by 1.6-fold in arsenic-exposed cells. In addition to the altered histone remodeling status on the myogenin promoter, protein and mRNA levels of Igf-1, a myogenic growth factor, were significantly repressed by arsenic exposure. Moreover, a 2-fold induction of Ezh2 expression, and an increased recruitment of Ezh2 (3.3-fold) and Dnmt3a (similar to 2-fold) to the myogenin promoter at the transcription start site (-40 to +42), were detected in the arsenic-treated cells. Together, we conclude that the repressed myogenin expression in arsenic-exposed C2C12 cells was likely due to a combination of reduced expression of Igf-1, enhanced nuclear expression and promoter recruitment of Ezh2, and altered histone remodeling status on myogenin promoter (-40 to +42).

We find that this behavior depends strongly on the geometry of the nanotube fragment. Fragments from (n, n) nanotubes with n <= 5 quickly form closed structures. Whether the terminations of (n, 0) fragments (n <= 9) close depends on the structure of the termination. Those forming a zigzag structure remain open for the duration of our simulations. Fragments from (n, n) nanotubes with n >= 6 exhibit surprising behavior, with (7, 7) fragments unfolding to form thermodynamically unfavorable graphene fragments. These results suggest that small-radius (n, n) fragments will be unreactive with other molecules, large-radius (n, n) fragments will react with other molecules, and the reactivity of (n, 0) fragments will depend on the details of their structure. We include a discussion of the accelerated molecular dynamics methods and some of the implementation details to give the reader a sense of how they can be effectively applied to this kind of system.

Liquefaction and cyclic softening potential of soils - a unified piezocone penetration testing-based approach								GEOTECHNIQUE				62	5			457	461		10.1680/geot.10.P.044			MAY 2012	2012	Simplified procedures have been widely accepted and used in practice for assessing cyclic liquefaction resistance of sands. Extension of the simplified procedures for assessing liquefaction resistance of fine-grained soils has not achieved the same degree of success. It would be ideal to have a unified model that is based on in situ testing and is applicable to both sand-like and clay-like soils. This note examines one such model and extends its use to both sand-like and clay-like soils. Herein, verification of this unified model using field data from Adapazari, Turkey after the 1999 earthquake is documented along with comparisons with existing models. Satisfactory results are obtained, which shows that the proposed piezocone penetration test (CPTu)-based model is applicable to both sand-like and clay-like soils.									4	0	0	1	0	4			0016-8505			WOS:000303354500007

Aboveground Root Collar Excavation of Peach Trees for Armillaria Root Rot Management								PLANT DISEASE				96	5			681	686		10.1094/PDIS-06-11-0493			MAY 2012	2012	Root collar excavation (RCE) has been applied to established citrus trees and grapevines for Armillaria root rot (ARR) control but, despite its demonstrated effectiveness, this cultural management system is not routinely used for ARR protection in disease-infested replant sites. One major drawback is the difficulty of excavating the belowground root collar, the potential of excavated roots to be covered again with surrounding soil, and the associated labor cost. In this study, a new cultural method was investigated that resulted in trees with aboveground excavated root collars, potentially eliminating many of the drawbacks. Experimental peach trees were planted in two commercial orchards (designated Landrum and Monetta) in South Carolina; each tree replaced one that had declined from ARR disease the year before. Trees were planted approximately 40 cm higher than normal in open-bottom Smart Pots and root collars were excavated above ground level 8 months later. Five years after planting, 30 and 70% of all control trees (planted according to grower standard) had declined from ARR disease in Landrum and Monetta, respectively, whereas only 0 and 10%, respectively, of trees in the aboveground root collar excavation (AG-RCE) treatment had declined. The difference in disease pressure between the two locations could not be attributed to differences in nematode pressure. Nonexcavated trees in Smart Pots revealed significantly less tree decline (P <= 0.05) compared with the control but tree decline in both locations was greater compared with the AG-RCE treatment (P <= 0.05). Trees in the AG-RCE treatment were as vigorous as the controls but produced more root suckers. In this 'prototype' study, we demonstrate the potential of aboveground root collar excavation for ARR management. Its potential for commercial use is discussed.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0191-2917			WOS:000303085800011

The concept of Poincare maps may be applied to health monitoring systems. In this paper, a diagnosis strategy based on Poincare maps will be presented to evaluate dynamic systems' behavior with application to power generating gas turbines based on the repeatability of the transition trajectories. Using this approach, extensive operating data for three 85 MW simple cycle power generating gas turbines were evaluated to assess and analyze their performance. The proposed strategy was capable of isolating failed starts; automatic unloads and load rejection events as major events during the test period. Results and conclusions drawn in this study regarding the health condition of the rotating equipment demonstrate the opportunity for system monitoring.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0742-4795			WOS:000301517800008

Ruminal escape and intestinal digestibility of ruminally protected lysine supplements differing in oleic acid and lysine concentrations								JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE				95	5			2680	2684		10.3168/jds.2011-5203			MAY 2012	2012	This trial was conducted to determine the effect of the addition of 2 or 4% oleic acid to an hydrogenated fat coating applied to an experimental supplement with 55 or 58% lysine sulfate on ruminal escape and intestinal absorption of Lys. Two lactating Holstein cows (103 d in milk and 45.1 kg/d of milk) previously fitted with ruminal and duodenal cannulas were individually housed and fed a corn silage-based ration. In situ and mobile bag techniques were utilized to evaluate the 4 test products. Twenty bags of each product were incubated for 16 h in each cow to determine ruminal escape. After ruminal incubation, products were repackaged, soaked in pepsin/HCl solution for 2 h, inserted into the duodenum, and subsequently collected in the feces. The percentage of dry matter and fat escaping the rumen decreased as oleic acid increased from 2 to 4% or as the proportion of supplemental Lys increased. An interaction was observed because of a greater reduction of N and Lys escaping ruminal fermentation and flowing to the small intestine for the product with 58% supplemental Lys and 4% oleic acid compared with the other products. No differences were observed in intestinal digestibility of dry matter, N, Lys, or fat or in the amount of Lys digested in the small intestine. Increasing the proportion of oleic acid in the coating applied to supplemental Lys increased ruminal degradation. The extent of the degradation increased as the proportion of Lys in the product increased.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0022-0302			WOS:000303074900044	22541496

Because of the different modes of operation, devising a near optimal energy management strategy is quite challenging and essential for these vehicles. To improve the fuel economy of a power-split HEV, we first formulate the energy management problem as a nonlinear and constrained optimal control problem. Then two different cost functions are defined and model predictive control (MPC) strategies are utilized to obtain the power split between the combustion engine and electrical machines and the system operating points at each sample time. Simulation results on a closed-loop high-fidelity model of a power-split HEV over multiple standard drive cycles and with different controllers are presented. The results of a nonlinear MPC strategy show a noticeable improvement in fuel economy with respect to those of an available controller in the commercial Powertrain System Analysis Toolkit (PSAT) software and the other proposed methodology by the authors based on a linear time-varying MPC.									115	9	0	0	0	121			1063-6536			WOS:000302699100003

Heat inactivation of Salmonella spp. in fresh poultry compost by simulating early phase of composting process								JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY				112	5			927	935		10.1111/j.1365-2672.2012.05268.x			MAY 2012	2012	Aims: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of moisture on thermal inactivation of Salmonella spp. in poultry litter under optimal composting conditions.Methods and Results: Thermal inactivation of Salmonella was studied in fresh poultry compost by simulating early phase of composting process. A mixture of three Salmonella serotypes grown in Tryptic soy broth with rifampin (TSB-R) was inoculated in fresh compost with 40 or 50% moisture at a final concentration of c. 7 log CFU g(-1). The inoculated compost was kept in an environmental chamber which was programmed to rise from room temperature to target composting temperatures in 2 days. In poultry compost with optimal moisture content (50%), Salmonella spp. survived for 96, 72 and 24 h at 50, 55 and 60 degrees C, respectively, as compared with 264, 144 and 72 h at 50, 55 and 60 degrees C, respectively, in compost with suboptimal moisture (40%). Pathogen decline was faster during the come-up time owing to higher ammonia volatilization.Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that Salmonella spp. survived longer in fresh poultry compost with suboptimal moisture of 40% than in compost with optimal moisture of 50% during thermophilic composting. High nitrogen content of the poultry compost is an additional factor contributing to Salmonella inactivation through ammonia volatilization during thermal exposure.Significance and Impact of the Study: This research validated the effectiveness of the current composting guidelines on Salmonella inactivation in fresh poultry compost. Both initial moisture level and ammonia volatilization are important factors affecting microbiological safety and quality of compost product.									5	0	0	5	0	5			1364-5072			WOS:000302612700010	22372919

The recently introduced helium ion microscope (HIM), with its smaller probe size, longer depth of field and charge neutralization, has the potential to overcome the inherent limitations of electron microscopy for visualization of collagen network features, particularly at the nanoscale. In this study, we evaluated the capabilities of the helium ion microscope for high-resolution visualization of the articular cartilage collagen network. Images of rabbit knee cartilage were acquired with a helium ion microscope; comparison images were acquired with a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and a transmission electron microscope (TEM). Sharpness of example high-resolution helium ion microscope and field emission scanning electron microscope images was quantified using the 2575% rise distance metric. The helium ion microscope was able to acquire high-resolution images with unprecedented clarity, with greater sharpness and three-dimensional-like detail of nanoscale fibril morphologies and fibril connections, in samples without conductive coatings. These nanoscale features could not be resolved by field emission scanning electron microscopy, and three-dimensional network structure could not be visualized with transmission electron microscopy. The nanoscale three-dimensional-like visualization capabilities of the helium ion microscope will enable new avenues of investigation in cartilage collagen network research.									19	0	0	11	0	19			0022-2720			WOS:000302613600008	22416783

Three kinds of hydrolysates were prepared under optimal enzymatic parameters that were obtained from the preliminary one-factor-at-a-time test and response surface methodology. Thereafter, three enzymatic hydrolysates were sequentially fractionated by ultrafiltration membranes in cut-off MW of 30, 10, and 1 kDa, and tested in terms of their reducing power (RP). Effects of high-intensity pulsed electric field (PEF) were further investigated on the antioxidant peptides to improve their activities. RESULTS: Alcalase hydrolysates possessed stronger RP ability than the other two hydrolysates, particularly for the fraction within < 1 kDa. After PEF treatment, this fraction showed an improvement of RP ability within 4 h; however, the effects were reversible. High-performance liquid chromatographic analysis showed some MW changes of PEF-treated sample compared with control. CONCLUSIONS: Amongthe three kinds of proteases, alcalase could be regarded as the most appropriate enzyme for preparation of bioactive peptide from egg white protein, with the best antioxidant activity. Also, PEF showed some effects on the peptide and could be further applied to improve its antioxidant activity.

Since both peak-load pricing and price discrimination may be at play, we attempt to separate these two forms of pricing. We find that as competition increases there is a decrease in the weekend premium, which we attribute to price discrimination. Additionally, we find that resort courses and courses that are heavily dependent on tourism have less differential pricing, which we attribute to less peak demand and less peak-load pricing.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0889-938X			WOS:000302356700001

Overall, large gender differences in career plans were found, with males showing far more interest particularly in engineering, whereas females were more attracted to careers in health and medicine during their high school years. The key factor predicting STEM career interest at the end of high school was interest at the start of high school. There was an additional effect of gender, indicating both a lower retention of STEM career interest among females and a greater difficulty in attracting females to STEM fields during high school. During the high school years, the percentage of males interested in a STEM career remained stable (from 39.5 to 39.7), whereas for females it declined from 15.7 to 12.7. The students' initial specific (disciplinary) career interests were found to influence the stability of their interest in a STEM career, with those interested in physics careers at the start of high school having the highest retention in STEM.

About 63% of older adults reported at least one type of everyday discrimination and 31% reported at least one major discriminatory event during lifetime. Blacks, those separated, divorced, or widowed, and those with lower household assets have higher levels of perceived discrimination than Whites, the married or partnered, and those with more assets. Perceived discrimination is negatively associated with changes in health over 2 years, and everyday discrimination has stronger effects than major discriminatory events, especially on emotional health. The effects of perceived everyday discrimination on changes in depressive symptoms and self-rated health are independent of general stress. Efforts to reduce discrimination, including perceptions of discrimination, can be beneficial for health in old age.									23	0	0	6	0	23			0164-0275			WOS:000302099300003

Recombinant protein therapeutics, primarily produced in mammalian cells, constitute a $108 billion global market. The most common mammalian cell line used in biologic production processes is the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line, and although great improvements have been made in titer production over the past 25 years, the underlying molecular and physiological factors are not well understood. Confident understanding of CHO bioprocessing elements (e.g. cell line selection, protein production, and reproducibility of process performance and product specifications) would significantly improve with a well understood genome. This review describes mammalian cell culture use in bioprocessing, the importance of obtaining CHO cell line genetic sequences, and the current status of sequencing efforts. Furthermore, transcriptomic techniques and gene expression tools are presented, and case studies exploring genomic techniques and applications aimed to improve mammalian bioprocess performance are reviewed. Finally, future implications of genomic advances are surmised. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.									18	0	0	18	0	18			0734-9750			WOS:000301901500012	22079893

However, despite the widely accepted importance of agility, there is limited research on this construct. In this study we aim to conceptually define and operationalize firm's customer agility. We propose that agility comprises two distinct capabilities, sensing and responding, and we address the issue of alignment between these capabilities and its impact on performance. Using a dynamic capabilities framework, we formulate both matching and mediating perspectives on customer agility. Based on data collected from marketing managers, we tested hypotheses pertaining to the two methods of alignment. The results indicate significant support for the role of both forms of alignment on performance. Implications for research and practice are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In response to the problems of existing schemes on the security resiliency, applicability and filtering effectiveness, this paper proposes a scheme, referred to as Grouping-enhanced Resilient Probabilistic En-route Filtering (GRPEF). In GRPEF, an efficient distributed algorithm is proposed to group nodes without incurring extra groups, and a multiaxis division based approach for deriving location-aware keys is used to overcome the threshold problem and remove the dependence on the sink immobility and routing protocols. Compared to the existing schemes, GRPEF significantly improves the effectiveness of the en-route filtering and can be applied to the sensor networks with mobile sinks while reserving the resiliency.									1	1	0	0	0	2			1045-9219	1558-2183		WOS:000301890400010

Nowadays, with the boom of multimedia sharing, users tend to share more and more with their online peers within online communities such as forums. The server-client model of forums has been used since its creation in the mid-1990s. However, this model has begun to fall short in meeting the increasing need of bandwidth and storage resources as an increasing number of people share more and more multimedia content. In this work, we first investigate the unique properties of forums based on the data collected from the Disney discussion boards. According to these properties, we design a scheme to support P2P-based multimedia sharing in forums called Multimedia Board (MBoard). Extensive trace-driven simulation results utilizing real trace data show that MBoard can significantly reduce the load on the server while maintaining a high quality of service for the users.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1045-9219			WOS:000301890400018

Due to its low voltage and power output, MFCs are unable to directly drive most commercial electronic devices. A power management system (PMS) is needed to accumulate MFC energy first and then drive the load intermittently. In this study, a transformer-based PMS is proposed, which is able to function under a lower voltage input than other available MFC PMS designs. Two super-capacitors are included in the proposed PMS. The first is analytically optimized to maximize the average harvested power, while the second is selected based on the energy required to drive a given load. A continuous-mode MFC was built and used to successfully drive an IEEE 802.15.4 wireless sensor system using the proposed PMS. Experimental results showed that the proposed PMS worked well under a very low input voltage (0.18 V). The configuration of two super-capacitors and a transformer in this transformer-based PMS provides more flexibility in harvesting power from MFCs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Using wirelessly communicated predictive traffic data for vehicles in a roadway network, as envisioned in intelligent transportation systems, traffic prediction cycles are optimized using a cycle optimization strategy. This resulted in a 56-86% fuel efficiency improvements for conventional vehicles. When combined with the plug-in hybrid electric vehicle power management system, about 115% energy efficiency improvements were achieved. Further improvements in the overall energy efficiency of the network were achieved with increased penetration rates of the intelligent transportation assisted enabled plug-in hybrid electric vehicles.

The algorithm allows a long link of the network to be used as a buffer to keep the traffic flow moving in. Concurrently, a detour trigger time is estimated to keep the traffic under-saturated in the buffer zone and minimize the total travel time. The integration algorithm presented in this paper is an efficient mathematical solution for travel time cost calculation. A case study is presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the traffic demand buffering strategy developed in this research for managing the evacuation flow. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The results were then compared with those from obtained using the HPLD-UVD (ultraviolet detection) that has been conventionally used for measuring SAC in raw garlic. The SAC content in raw garlic measured by the HPLC-FLD and the HPLD-UVD were 21.52 and 22.73 mu g/g, respectively. And these results were satisfactory with %CV (coefficient of variation) less than 2%. However, the application of the HPLC-UVD for the determination of SAC in black garlic was limited due to the high %CV that arose from the unstable baseline. However, the HPLC-FLD could be applied to the measurement of SAC in black garlic with satisfactory %CV. The HPLC-FLD method was validated by determining the linearity, limit of detection, limit of quantification, accuracy and precision. This method showed excellent linearity with a coefficient of determination (R-2) greater than 0.998. The limits of detection (L0D) and the limit of quantification (LOQ) were 6.28 and 19.02 mu g/mL, respectively. The accuracy ranged from 98.51 to 102.08%, and the precision of the method was found to be less than 2%. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Surface morphology, cross sectional images, and mechanical, barrier, and optical properties of the oxygen scavenging fish gelatin (OSFG) film were compared to those of the unmodified fish gelatin (UMFG) film. Results indicated that the OSS was well incorporated into the OSFG film structure. The OSFG film had rough film surface, increased water vapor and oxygen permeability, and decreased tensile strength due to the incorporation and agglomerations of the OSS. The incorporation of the OSS also caused color and haze alterations to the OSFG film. In addition, the oxygen scavenging capability of the OSFG film was investigated. The initial oxygen content (%) in the cup headspace, 20.90%, was decreased to 4.56% after 50 days of storage. The OSFG film had good oxygen scavenging capacity, 1969.08 cc O-2/m(2)/mil, and moisture was used as the activator to trigger the oxygen scavenging reaction.

T. Mikulski, M. T. Knippenberg, and J. A. Harrison, J. Chem. Phys. 131, 241105 (2009)], is integrated into a new bond-order potential for interactions between oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. This reactive potential utilizes the formalism of the adaptive intermolecular reactive empirical bond-order potential [S. J. Stuart, A. B. Tutein, and J. A. Harrison, J. Chem. Phys. 112, 6472 (2000)] with additional terms for oxygen and charge interactions. This implementation of the reactive potential is able to model chemical reactions where partial charges change in gas-and condensed-phase systems containing oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. The BOP/SQE method prevents the unrestricted growth of charges, often observed in charge equilibration methods, without adding significant computational time, because it makes use of a quantity which is calculated as part of the underlying covalent portion of the potential, namely, the bond order. The implementation of this method with the qAIREBO potential is designed to provide a tool that can be used to model dynamics in a wide range of systems without significant computational cost. To demonstrate the usefulness and flexibility of this potential, heats of formation for isolated molecules, radial distribution functions of liquids, and energies of oxygenated diamond surfaces are calculated.

Major issues in threat analysis and resolving such problems: an addendum to the GAP analysis								Journal of Threatened Taxa				4	4			2545	2550					APR 26 2012	2012	Identification of regions that warrant conservation attention is a top priority among global environmental concerns. Conventionally, this objective was achieved via recognizing natural landscapes based on the number of IUCN Red Listed species, percentage of endemism and species diversity. A recent innovation in conservation biology is the use of GIS-based threat analysis models to identify key areas of conservation importance. Compared with GAP Analysis, which only identifies biodiversity-rich unprotected lands, threat analysis serves as a rigorous tool in conservation planning which specifically recognizes threats and habitat suitability to different taxa based on a spatially-explicit analysis. Threat analysis is a highly flexible process which involves building up a model with multiple independent (without autocorrelations) variables that both positively and negatively affect distribution and population persistence of a concerned species. Parameters include rate of land-use change, population density, population growth rate, land management regimes, protection status, habitat suitability and land stewardship. Threat analysis models can be used to understand the current status of a particular species (or a community) and can be used to project future trends about the species under consideration. This publication provides an overview of uses of GIS-based threat analyses in conservation biology and provides insights on the limitations of these models and the directions that should be taken in future.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0974-7893	0974-7907		BCI:BCI201200402480

Rigorous theories, including the principles of Maximum Likelihood and the Information Theory, are employed in the model development. The developed probabilistic models are compared with existing models. The results show superior capability of the developed models. Furthermore, application of the developed models is presented with provisions for consideration of input parameter uncertainty. Examples are presented to demonstrate the developed models.

Previous estimates of this mortality have been based on limited data and have not included Canada. We compiled a database of communication towers in the continental United States and Canada and estimated avian mortality by tower with a regression relating avian mortality to tower height. This equation was derived from 38 tower studies for which mortality data were available and corrected for sampling effort, search efficiency, and scavenging where appropriate. Although most studies document mortality at guyed towers with steady-burning lights, we accounted for lower mortality at towers without guy wires or steady-burning lights by adjusting estimates based on published studies. The resulting estimate of mortality at towers is 6.8 million birds per year in the United States and Canada. Bootstrapped subsampling indicated that the regression was robust to the choice of studies included and a comparison of multiple regression models showed that incorporating sampling, scavenging, and search efficiency adjustments improved model fit. Estimating total avian mortality is only a first step in developing an assessment of the biological significance of mortality at communication towers for individual species or groups of species. Nevertheless, our estimate can be used to evaluate this source of mortality, develop subsequent per-species mortality estimates, and motivate policy action.									37	0	0	33	0	39			1932-6203			WOS:000305345200007	22558082

Recently, it has been shown that they can be realized even in a class of electron-doped semiconductors, on which ordinary s-wave superconductivity is proximity induced, provided the time reversal symmetry is broken by an external Zeeman field above a threshold. Here we show that in a hole-doped semiconductor nanowire the threshold Zeeman field for Majorana fermions can be very small for some magic values of the hole density. In contrast to the electron-doped systems, smaller Zeeman fields and much stronger spin-orbit coupling and effective mass of holes allow the hole-doped systems to support Majorana fermions in a parameter regime which is routinely realized in current experiments.									32	0	0	1	0	32			0031-9007			WOS:000303191100017	22680893

Batsch] and related Prunus species, only a limited number of genetic markers, including simple sequence repeats (SSRs), have been available to date. To address this need, an international consortium (The International Peach SNP Consortium; IPSC) has pursued a coordinated effort to perform genome-scale SNP discovery in peach using next generation sequencing platforms to develop and characterize a high-throughput Illumina Infinium (R) SNP genotyping array platform. We performed whole genome re-sequencing of 56 peach breeding accessions using the Illumina and Roche/454 sequencing technologies. Polymorphism detection algorithms identified a total of 1,022,354 SNPs. Validation with the Illumina GoldenGate (R) assay was performed on a subset of the predicted SNPs, verifying similar to 75% of genic (exonic and intronic) SNPs, whereas only about a third of intergenic SNPs were verified. Conservative filtering was applied to arrive at a set of 8,144 SNPs that were included on the IPSC peach SNP array v1, distributed over all eight peach chromosomes with an average spacing of 26.7 kb between SNPs. Use of this platform to screen a total of 709 accessions of peach in two separate evaluation panels identified a total of 6,869 (84.3%) polymorphic SNPs. The almost 7,000 SNPs verified as polymorphic through extensive empirical evaluation represent an excellent source of markers for future studies in genetic relatedness, genetic mapping, and dissecting the genetic architecture of complex agricultural traits. The IPSC peach SNP array v1 is commercially available and we expect that it will be used worldwide for genetic studies in peach and related stone fruit and nut species.									89	3	0	83	4	92			1932-6203			WOS:000305339200093	22536421

Moreover, we observe a clear anisotropic thermal conductivity indicating that the magnetic anisotropy enhances thermoelectric properties along particular crystallographic directions.									9	0	0	1	0	9			0031-9007			WOS:000303070600021	22680752

Previously published observations as to the distinct differences in solubility trends for gases such as CH4 and N-2 relative to CO2 in systematically varied ILs can be attributed to positive and negative effects arising from increasing free volume with increasing alkyl chain length. Through the use of COSMOtherm as a powerful and rapid tool to calculate free volumes in 165 existing and theoretical 1-n-alky1-3-methylimidazolium ([C(n)mim][X]) ILs, a previously unreported, yet speculated, critical underlying relationship between gas solubility in ILs is herein described. These results build upon previous assertions that Regular Solution Theory is applicable to imidazolium-based ILs, which appeared to indicate that a global maximum had already been observed for CO2 solubility in imidazolium-based Its. However, the findings of this computational study suggest that the perceived maximum in CO2 solubility might be exceeded through rational design of ILs. We observe that although Henry's constants in ILs are dependent on the inverse of molar volume and free volume, the volume-normalized solubility of CH4 and N-2 are proportional to free volume, while CO2 is inversely proportional to the square root of free volume. Our free volume model is compared to experimental data for CO2/CH4 and CO2/N-2 selectivity, and a nearly identical plot of selectivity relative to IL molar volume can be generated from the computational method alone. The overall implication is that large, highly delocalized anions paired with imidazolium cations that have minimally sized alkyl chains may hold the key to achieving greater CO2 solubility and selectivity in ILs.									64	0	0	2	0	64			0888-5885			WOS:000302882400024

Most studies of species-environment relationships utilize classic distributions and regression methods which may oversimplify results, as they often involve initial reduction of data, a priori model specification, and parsimonious model selection. We re-analyzed a dataset collected in a study of environment-reproductive effort relationships for two amphibian species. This data was originally analyzed using negative binomial regression and AIC model selection; we applied a multivariate analysis, a variant of Redundancy Analysis (RDA), to the same dataset to examine if additional information was revealed. The multivariate analysis identified the same primary drivers as did model selection: in the context of relatively intact forests, hydroperiod was the most important factor contributing to reproductive effort. However, the RDA elucidated what may be new primary and secondary drivers related to forest structure and composition. Reproductive effort was strongly associated with tree species richness, canopy cover, and presence of individual tree species; the strength of these relationships varied between amphibian species and across spatial scales. Spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) were strongly influenced by microclimate conditions and wood frogs (Litho bates sylvaticus) by pool canopy cover and presence of wetland tree species. A priori, parsimonious model selection assists managers by delivering biologically defensible, simple explanations. However the process reduces hypothesis-generating potential and omits variables that may become important as environments change.

To this end, barnacle cyprid larvae have evolved sophisticated sensory mechanisms to investigate chemical as well as topographical composition of the substratum. Since barnacles are major biofoulers, the sensory structures of Balanus amphitrite cyprids have been described in detail using ultrastructural techniques like SEM and TEM. Settlement assays have shown that cyprid settlement is deterred by adrenergic receptor agonists and antagonists, yet the exact location of these receptors on cyprid sensory structures is unknown. Here, using a fluorescent adrenergic receptor antagonist (Bodipy FL-Prazosin) with the aid of confocal microscopy we describe the putative locations of adrenergic-like receptors in B. amphitrite cyprids. Our results indicate that postaxial setae 2 and 3 of the 2nd and 3rd segments respectively, the sub-terminal setae of the 4th antennular segment and the cement gland secretory cells seem to bear the adrenergic-like receptors. Using optical and electron microscopy we further studied the effects of noradrenaline (NA), an adrenergic receptor agonist, on cyprid settlement and metamorphosis. NA treated cyprids forgo the typical settlement behavior and metamorphose into juvenile barnacles without cementing to the substratum. Cyprid-barnacle metamorphosis in NA treated cyprids is also prolonged as compared to untreated barnacles. The key role played by adrenergic-like receptors during surface sensing, cementation and metamorphosis is discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Here we describe the anti-inflammatory activity of new bergenin derivatives 1-15 in the respiratory burst assay. Bergenin was isolated from the crude extract of Mallotus philippenensis after repeated column chromatography and was then subjected to chemical derivatization. The structures of all compounds were elucidated by NMR and mass spectroscopic techniques. Compound 2 was also studied using single crystal X-ray diffraction. Compounds 4, (54.5 +/- 2.2%) 5 (47.5 +/- 0.5%) 5, and 15 (86.8 +/- 1.9%) showed significant (P <= 0.005) NO inhibitory activities whereas 6, 7, 11, 12 and 13 displayed moderate inhibitory activities that ranges between 16% and 31%. Furthermore compounds 4 and 15, were discovered as significant (P <= 0.005) TNF-alpha inhibitors with 98% and 96% inhibition, respectively, while compounds 3, 5, 7, 8, 11, and 12 showed low level of TNF-alpha inhibition (0.4-28%). Compounds 8, 13 and 15 exhibited moderate anti-inflammatory IC50 activities with 212, 222, and 253 mu M, respectively, compared to the standard anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin as well as the parent bergenin compound.

The findings impact engineered water and wastewater treatment using membrane technology, characterization and analytical schemes for NP detection, and the use of NPs in waste treatment scenarios. The NPs studied were composed of silver, titanium dioxide, and gold; had organic coatings to yield either positive or negative surface charge; and were between 2 and 10 nm in diameter. NP solutions were applied to polymeric membranes composed of different materials and pore sizes (ranging from similar to 2 nm [3 kDa molecular weight cutoff] to 0.2 mu m). Greater than 99% rejection was observed of positively charged NPs by negatively charged membranes even though pore diameters were up to 20 times the NP diameter; thus, sorption caused rejection. Negatively charged NPs were less well rejected, but behavior was dependant not only on surface functionality but on NP core material (Ag, TiO2, or Au). NP rejection depended more upon NP properties than membrane properties; all of the negatively charged polymeric membranes behaved similarly. The NP-membrane interaction behavior fell into four categories, which are defined and described here. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Turning randomness into meaning at the molecular level using Muller's morphs								BIOLOGY OPEN				1	4			405	410		10.1242/bio.2012031			APR 15 2012	2012	While evolutionary theory follows from observable facts and logical inferences (Mayr, 1985), historically, the origin of novel inheritable variations was a major obstacle to acceptance of natural selection (Bowler, 1992; Bowler, 2005). While molecular mechanisms address this issue (Jablonka and Lamb, 2005), analysis of responses to the Biological Concept Inventory (BCI) (Klymkowsky et al., 2010), revealed that molecular biology majors rarely use molecular level ideas in their discourse, implying that they do not have an accessible framework within which to place evolutionary variation. We developed a "Socratic tutorial" focused on Muller's categorization of mutations' phenotypic effects (Muller, 1932). Using a novel vector-based method to analyzed students' essay responses, we found that a single interaction with this tutorial led to significant changes in thinking toward a clearer articulation of the effects of mutational change.

J	Von White, Gregory, II; Provost, Matthew Grant; Kitchens, Christopher Lawrence				White II, Gregory/F-8267-2013				Fractionation of Surface-Modified Gold Nanorods Using Gas-Expanded Liquids								INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH				51	14			5181	5189		10.1021/ie201975p			APR 11 2012	2012	Gold nanorods (GNRs) have found widespread applications in nanocomposites and thin films, because of their unique optical, chemical, and photothermal properties, which are dictated by the rod size and aspect ratio. In this study, gold nanorods (GNRs, aspect ratio of 3-4) were synthesized using a high-yield, aqueous, solution-based method, followed by a surface modification reaction to facilitate their dispersion in organic media. A gas-expanded liquid (GXL) precipitation technique was used to effectively size-fractionate the GNRs with CO2 as a green antisolvent for hydrophobic nanorods dispersed in toluene, hexane, and cyclohexane. The advantages of using GXL media lie in the tunable solvent properties that enable size-selective nanoparticle precipitation that is easily controlled by the CO2 antisolvent partial pressure. This work demonstrated effective GNR size fractionation and a 73% reduction in the number of residual 4-nm-diameter spherical seed nanoparticles remaining after synthesis with a single precipitation and redispersion. The GNR dispersibility and precipitation was monitored by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorbance spectroscopy and found to be dependent on the solvent choice and GNR ligand. CO2-expanded cyclohexane provided the greatest dispersibility of GNRs stabilized by 18-carbon-chain-length ligands, which were dispersible at pressures up to roughly 30 bar (0.44 mol fraction CO2), compared to a lower pressure, on the order of 24 bar for CO2-expanded toluene (similar to 0.21 mol fraction CO2) and n-hexane (0.31 mol fraction CO2). Varying the hydrophobic stabilizing ligand chain length also impacted nanorod dispersibility in CO2-expanded toluene, where 12-carbon-chain-length dodecanethiol ligands yielded nanorod dispersion/precipitation at CO2 pressures much greater than those for the 18-carbon octadecanethiol ligands. This work is the first application of a GXL solvent medium for the processing, purification, and size fractionation of nonspherical particles, which has led to a greater understanding of gold nanorod dispersibility and demonstrated the feasibility of GXLs as a green solvent medium for post-synthesis nanorod processing.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0888-5885			WOS:000302505300009		
J	Towler, M. D.; Russell, N. J.; Valentini, Antony								Time scales for dynamical relaxation to the Born rule								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES				468	2140			990	1013		10.1098/rspa.2011.0598			APR 8 2012	2012	We illustrate through explicit numerical calculations how the Born rule probability densities of non-relativistic quantum mechanics emerge naturally from the particle dynamics of de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave theory. The time evolution of a particle distribution initially not equal to the absolute square of the wave function is calculated for a particle in a two-dimensional infinite potential square well. Under the de Broglie-Bohm ontology, the box contains an objectively existing 'pilot wave' which guides the electron trajectory, and this is represented mathematically by a Schrodinger wave function composed of a finite out-of-phase superposition of M energy eigenstates (with M ranging from 4 to 64). The electron density distributions are found to evolve naturally into the Born rule ones and stay there; in analogy with the classical case this represents a decay to 'quantum equilibrium'. The proximity to equilibrium is characterized by the coarse-grained subquantum H-function which is found to decrease roughly exponentially towards zero over the course of time. The time scale tau for this relaxation is calculated for various values of M and the coarse-graining length epsilon. Its dependence on M is found to disagree with an earlier theoretical prediction. A power law, tau proportional to M (1), is found to be fairly robust for all coarse-graining lengths and, although a weak dependence of tau on epsilon is observed, it does not appear to follow any straightforward scaling. A theoretical analysis is presented to explain these results. This improvement in our understanding of time scales for relaxation to quantum equilibrium is likely to be of use in the development of models of relaxation in the early Universe, with a view to constraining possible violations of the Born rule in inflationary cosmology.									13	0	0	0	0	13			1364-5021	1471-2946		WOS:000300820800005

We discovered that the proboscis promotes capillary pull of liquids from diverse sources owing to a hierarchical pore structure spanning nano- and microscales. X-ray phase-contrast imaging reveals that Plateau instability causes liquid bridges to form in the food canal, which are transported to the gut by the muscular sucking pump in the head. The dual functionality of the proboscis represents a key innovation for exploiting a vast range of nutritional sources. We suggest that future studies of the adaptive radiation of the Lepidoptera take into account the role played by the structural organization of the proboscis. A transformative two-step model of capillary intake and suctioning can be applied not only to butterflies and moths but also potentially to vast numbers of other insects such as bees and flies.									27	0	0	18	0	28			1742-5689			WOS:000300726700012	21849382

The superlattice is modeled as a sequence of parallel wires that support tunneling between adjacent sites, leading to the formation of extended Bloch states along its axis and a miniband in the energy spectrum. Our results, obtained by calculating the eigenvalues of the Cooperon operator in the diffusion approximation, indicate that the electron dephasing rate that determines the antilocalization correction is enhanced by a term proportional with the LSL potential and the bandwidth. Within the same formalism, the spin-relaxation rates associated with the localization corrections are found to exhibit a strong anisotropy dictated by the relative strength of the two SOI couplings, as well as by the orientation of the LSL axis.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1098-0121			WOS:000302403400005

Comparative mapping between the member species in Rosaceae have indicated some level of synteny. Recently the whole genome of three crop species, peach, apple and strawberry, which belong to different genera of the Rosaceae family, have been sequenced, allowing in-depth comparison of these genomes.Results: Our analysis using the whole genome sequences of peach, apple and strawberry identified 1399 orthologous regions between the three genomes, with a mean length of around 100 kb. Each peach chromosome showed major orthology mostly to one strawberry chromosome, but to more than two apple chromosomes, suggesting that the apple genome went through more chromosomal fissions in addition to the whole genome duplication after the divergence of the three genera. However, the distribution of contiguous ancestral regions, identified using the multiple genome rearrangements and ancestors (MGRA) algorithm, suggested that the Fragaria genome went through a greater number of small scale rearrangements compared to the other genomes since they diverged from a common ancestor. Using the contiguous ancestral regions, we reconstructed a hypothetical ancestral genome for the Rosaceae 7 composed of nine chromosomes and propose the evolutionary steps from the ancestral genome to the extant Fragaria, Prunus and Malus genomes.Conclusion: Our analysis shows that different modes of evolution may have played major roles in different subfamilies of Rosaceae. The hypothetical ancestral genome of Rosaceae and the evolutionary steps that lead to three different lineages of Rosaceae will facilitate our understanding of plant genome evolution as well as have a practical impact on knowledge transfer among member species of Rosaceae.									41	1	0	40	0	42			1471-2164			WOS:000305004800001	22475018

While surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (SPR) and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) methods have proven to be very useful in measuring fundamental properties characterizing adsorption behavior, such as the free energy of adsorption for peptide-surface interactions, these methods are largely restricted to use for materials that can readily form nanoscale-thick films over the respective sensor surfaces. Many materials including most polymers, ceramics, and inorganic glasses, however, are not readily suitable for use with SPR or QCM methods. To overcome these limitations, we recently showed that desorption forces (F-des) obtained using a standardized AFM method linearly correlate to standard-state adsorption free energy values (Delta G degrees(ads)) measured from SPR in phosphate buffered saline (PBS: phosphate buffered 140 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). This approach thus provides a means to determine Delta G degrees(ads) for peptide adsorption using AFM that can be applied to any flat material surface. In this present study, we investigated the F-des-Delta G degrees(ads) correlation between AFM and SPR data in PBS for a much broader range of systems including eight different types of peptides on a set of eight different alkanethiol self-assembled monolayer (SAM) surfaces. The resulting correlation was then used to estimate Delta G degrees(ads) from F-des determined by AFM for selected bulk polymer and glass/ceramic materials such as poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), fused silica glass, and a quartz (100) surface. The results of these studies support our previous findings regarding the strong correlation between F-des measured by AFM and Delta G degrees(ads) determined by SPR, and provides a means to estimate Delta G degrees(ads) for peptide adsorption on macroscopically thick samples of materials that are not conducive for use with SPR or QCM.									28	1	0	10	0	29			0743-7463			WOS:000302852000025	22397583

A recent example is provided by s-wave superconductivity on a semiconductor platform, which is tuned through a TQCP to a topological superconducting (TS) state by an external Zeeman field. Despite many attractive features of TS states, TQCPs themselves do not break any symmetries, making it impossible to distinguish the TS state from a regular superconductor in conventional bulk measurements. Here we show that for the semiconductor TQCP this problem can be overcome by tracking suitable bulk transport properties across the topological quantum critical regime itself. The universal low-energy effective theory and the scaling form of the relevant susceptibilities also provide a useful theoretical framework in which to understand the topological transitions in semiconductor heterostructures. Based on our theory, specific bulk measurements are proposed here in order to characterize the novel TQCP in semiconductor heterostructures.									11	0	0	0	0	11			1098-0121			WOS:000302290900002

Two Novel Acentric Borate Fluorides: M3B6O11F2 (M = Sr, Ba)								INORGANIC CHEMISTRY				51	7			3953	3955		10.1021/ic202318b			APR 2 2012	2012	Two novel, noncentrosymmetric borate fluorides, Sr3B6O11F2 and Ba3B6O11F2, have been synthesized hydrothermally and their structures determined. The compounds are isostructural, crystallizing in space group P2(1), having lattice parameters of a = 6.4093 (13) angstrom, b = 8.2898 (17) angstrom, c = 9.3656 (19) angstrom, and beta = 101.51 (3)degrees for Sr3B6O11F2 and a = 6.5572 (13) angstrom, b = 8.5107 (17) angstrom, c = 9.6726 (19) angstrom, and beta = 101.21 (3)degrees for Ba3B6O11F2. The structure consists of a complex triple-ring borate framework having aligned triangular [BO3] groups that impart polarity. Fluorine atoms are bound only to the alkaline-earth metals and are not part of the borate framework, resulting in a vastly different structure from those of the hydrated borates Sr3B6O11(OH)(2) and Ba3B6O11(OH)(2) with similar formulas. The title compounds are transparent to nearly 200 nm, making them potentially useful for deep-ultraviolet nonlinear-optical applications.									40	0	0	2	0	40			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000302186600011	22409297

Their structures were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and further characterized by IR, powder XRD, and DSC/TGA. Compound 1 crystallizes in the triclinic space group P-1 with unit cell parameters of a = 6.6275(13) angstrom, b = 6.6706(13) angstrom, c = 11.393(2) angstrom, alpha = 91.06(3)degrees, beta = 94.50(3)degrees, and gamma = 93.12(3)degrees, while compound 2 crystallizes in the noncentrosymmetric monoclinic space group Pc with a = 6.958(14) angstrom, b = 7.024(14) angstrom, c = 11.346(2) angstrom, and beta = 90.10(3)degrees. In spite of the differences in symmetry and packing of the borate chains, both structures consist of the same fundamental building block (FBB) of a [B6O11(H)(2)](-6) unit and three unique alkaline earth metal atoms.									25	0	0	0	0	25			0020-1669			WOS:000302186600012	22409533

Results reveal that at every stage of the forecasting cycle forecast smoothing was the most widespread and persistent type of inefficiency observed in most U.S. variables. Correlation with past errors indicated the tendency to repeat past errors in most cases. Tendency to overestimate growth was also found. Bias was uncommon and limited to several cases of overestimation of China's exports and U.S. price and underestimation of China's domestic use. While forecasts of China's imports and endings stocks improved, U.S. price and ending stock forecast errors became larger toward the end of the study period.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1068-5502			WOS:000302378300006

Experiments were conducted for a jet axial separation to nozzle diameter ratio of 3.0 and the Reynolds numbers ranging from 8 000 to 15 000. The distance to the point where the jets are merged was measured for a range of jet source momentum flux ratios. Three different merger criteria were used based on the mean velocity profile, mean passive tracer concentration profile, and Reynolds stress profile. The results show that the concentration profile merges closest to the jet sources followed by the velocity profile with the Reynolds stress profile merging furthest from the nozzles. For all three profiles the merge distance is relatively insensitive to the momentum flux ratio, consistent with previous findings for slot jets and buoyant round jets. The measured merge distances are consistent with previously published results for equal round jets, though the poor spatial resolution of data in the literature means that limited comparison is possible. There are no studies of unequal jet merger currently in the literature that could be used for comparison.									3	1	0	0	0	3			1001-6058			WOS:000306107500012

One solution is educational intervention (Tyrrell, Patton, & Brooks, 2004); however, the on-road assessment of its effectiveness is expensive and time consuming. Method: Experiment One introduces a computer-based alternative to the field-based approach, successfully replicating the previous study's trends among 94 students who either receive or do not receive an educational lecture. Experiment Two utilizes the simulation's portability to determine if professional roadway workers have a more accurate understanding of pedestrian conspicuity than students. Results: Results among 88 workers show they do not significantly appreciate the advantages of effective retroflective material configurations or vehicle headlamp settings, for example, any better than non-lectured students in Experiment One. Impact: The study's results demonstrate the need for education among all pedestrians and the benefits of efficient testing methods. (C) 2012 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd.

It is newly reported from Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina, with additional records given for Florida, Mississippi, and Texas. Although adults have been taken on cordgrasses, Spartina species, the bug's host-plant relationships have remained undocumented. During extensive sampling of spartinas and other grasses in the southern United States, I found nymphs of G. litoralis near the coast and inland only on three species of Spartina: sand cordgrass (S. bakeri), saltmeadow cordgrass (S. patens), and gulf cordgrass (S. spartinae). The mind was not observed on two less architecturally complex species, big cordgrass (S. cynosuroides) and smooth cordgrass (S. alterniflora). Seasonal history of G. litoralis was followed from 2002 to 2010 (19 visits) by periodically sampling an inland colony of sand cordgrass near Avon Park (Highlands County) in the Lake Wales Ridge of the Florida peninsula. The presence of early instars in November, December, February, and March suggests that reproduction continues during winter. The presence of adults in all months of fieldwork (January July; November, December), coupled with published records of adults from August to October, suggests that the bug is multivoltine.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-8797			WOS:000304022800009

Several attributes are found to have a significant impact and become capitalized into differential values for senior apartments including the supply of apartments per senior resident, housing prices, market size, education, and life expectancy.

The particle dispersions were prepared in water and then encapsulated in an electrolytic PEG-based hydrogel matrix which was then placed in a spectroelectrochemical cell to allow for redox doping. Modifications of the redox states of the PEDOT coating induced by various redox mediators produced changes in the absorbance characteristics of the colloidal dispersion. Three oxidative mediator systems were studied (MV2+ / Ru(bpy) 3(2+), MV2+ /Fe (bpy)(3)(2+), and MV2+ /K2IrBr6). Of the three, the MV2+/K2IrBr6 mediator system was the most suitable for oxidizing (doping) the PEDOT without degradation on the time scales studied.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1452-3981			WOS:000304413000071

The structural and the optical properties of PS and of ZnO grown on PS were investigated using atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and photoluminescence. The residual stress of ZnO grown on PS could be relaxed and its structural and optical properties were improved with the introduction of a PS template as a substrate. In addition, the position of the UV emission peak for ZnO grown on PS was blue-shifted with increasing temperature. The coupling strength between excitons and LO phonons in ZnO grown on PS decreased with increasing temperature.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0374-4884			WOS:000304100000029

Michels, Paul/A-5637-2009; 	Sayce, Andrew/0000-0003-1108-3895			Extra-glycosomal localisation of Trypanosoma brucei hexokinase 2								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY				42	4			401	409		10.1016/j.ijpara.2012.02.008			APR 2012	2012	The majority of the glycolytic enzymes in the African trypanosome are compartmentalised within peroxisome-like organelles, the glycosomes. Polypeptides harbouring peroxisomal targeting sequences (PTS type 1 or 2) are targeted to these organelles. This targeting is essential to parasite viability, as compartmentalisation of glycolytic enzymes prevents unregulated ATP-dependent phosphorylation of intermediate metabolites. Here, we report the surprising extra-glycosomal localisation of a PTS-2 bearing trypanosomal hexokinase, TbHK2. In bloodstream form parasites, the protein localises to both glycosomes and to the flagellum. Evidence for this includes fractionation and immunofluorescence studies using antisera generated against the authentic protein as well as detection of epitope-tagged recombinant versions of the protein. In the insect stage parasite, distribution is different, with the polypeptide localised to glycosomes and proximal to the basal bodies. The function of the extra-glycosomal protein remains unclear. While its association with the basal body suggests that it may have a role in locomotion in the insect stage parasite, no detectable defect in directional motility or velocity of cell movement were observed for TbHK2-deficient cells, suggesting that the protein may have a different function in the cell.

Jacobsohn, Luiz/0000-0001-8991-3903			Spectral engineering of LaF3:Ce3+ nanoparticles: The role of Ce3+ in surface sites								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS				111	7					074315	10.1063/1.3700343			APR 1 2012	2012	Due to the high surface-to-volume ratio, luminescence centers on the surface have relative dominance in the overall spectral response of nanoparticles. The luminescence of LaF3:Ce3+ nanoparticles was investigated in the spectral and temporal domains with a particular focus on the role of Ce3+ on the surface. These nanoparticles present two luminescence bands at 4.10eV and 4.37 eV attributed to Ce3+ transitions from the 5d level to the spin-orbit split 4f ground levels F-2(5/2) and F-2(7/2), in addition to a low-energy band at 3.62 eV that has been attributed to Ce3+ ions residing in perturbed sites. The growth of up to three undoped shells, ca. 0.9 nm thick each, around the core promoted a progressive enhancement of luminescence output, concomitant with an increase in the fluorescence lifetime due to the weakening of energy transfer through multipolar interaction between Ce3+ in the core and quenching defects on the surface. Also, the growth of the first shell led to a decrease in the relative intensity of the low-energy band and a 0.23 eV shift to higher energies. These results were interpreted as being due to the existence of two types of perturbed sites, one on the surface that is eliminated by the growth of the first shell, and another within the volume of the nanoparticle, similar to observations in bulk single crystals. This work demonstrates how surface engineering can affect and control the luminescence behavior of this nanomaterial. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Schrad (Cucurbitaceae)] cultivars with different flesh colors were analyzed by HPLC, GC-FID, and GC-MS for their differences in carotenoid, soluble sugar, organic acid, and flavor. Results showed that all-trans violaxanthin, 9-cis-violaxanthin, and luteoxanthin were the main carotenoid esters in watermelons with yellow flesh. However, watermelons with red flesh were rich in all-trans lycopene and their cis-isomers. High concentrations of beta-carotene and pro-lycopenes were found in watermelon with orange-yellow flesh. Large variations in the sucrose concentration were observed among the different watermelons. Sucrose and/or fructose were the dominant sugars, while citric acid and malic acid were the main organic acids in watermelon flesh. Limonene was detected in the watermelon flesh of all investigated genotypes. Interestingly, partial correlation analysis of the chemical concentrations revealed 2 significant (p < 0.01) positive correlations between beta-ionone and beta-carotene, and between (E)-geranyl acetone and prolycopenes.									8	6	0	7	0	14			1226-7708			WOS:000303460100028

The data from the tests that have been performed are used to help develop nonlinear time history analysis models that can predict the behavior of woodframe buildings during strong ground shaking. It is difficult to test buildings to the point of collapse because such tests can damage costly test equipment, i.e., the shake table. This paper presents the results of a dynamic collapse test on a light-frame wood garage wall and the results of a numerical model to simulate the wall behavior all the way to the collapse point. The tested wall was heavily damaged as a result of subjecting it to a ground motion recorded during the 1995 Kobe earthquake. Then, 85% of a near-fault ground motion recording from the Northridge earthquake was used, which immediately collapsed the test specimen. A specialized wood shear wall analysis program, formulated using a corotational formulation and large deformation theory, was utilized to model the garage wall. The numerical model provided a good prediction (predicted the peak wall displacements to within 15% of the measured values), but as a direct result of the observed failure mechanism of the wall, it was determined that additional contact elements were needed in the model. Failure was observed at the sill plate of the garage wall returns and also in the sheathing due to a moment failure where the header connected to the wall returns. Finally, it was observed that variability in the stiffness of the hold-down connections has a significant influence on the uplift predictions. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943-541X.0000472.

In reality, there is heterogeneity in the number of contacts per individual, and individuals tend to imitate others who appear to have adopted successful strategies. Here, we use network-based mathematical models to study the effects of both imitation behavior and contact heterogeneity on vaccination coverage and disease dynamics. We integrate contact network epidemiological models with a framework for decision-making, within which individuals make their decisions either based purely on payoff maximization or by imitating the vaccination behavior of a social contact. Simulations suggest that when the cost of vaccination is high imitation behavior may decrease vaccination coverage. However, when the cost of vaccination is small relative to that of infection, imitation behavior increases vaccination coverage, but, surprisingly, also increases the magnitude of epidemics through the clustering of nonvaccinators within the network. Thus, imitation behavior may impede the eradication of infectious diseases. Calculations that ignore behavioral clustering caused by imitation may significantly underestimate the levels of vaccination coverage required to attain herd immunity.									27	0	0	14	0	27			1553-7358			WOS:000303440400021

The model was parameterized using various open-literature sources. The experimental portion of the work, which consisted of 28 projectile impacts onto glass/polyurethane/polycarbonate-based test laminates, was intended to allow for quantification of the effect of air-versus tin-side borofloat strike surface when incorporated into a multi-layer, multi-functional test laminate. Experimental findings indicated the lack of a significant difference in the impact resistance of air-versus tin-side test laminate strike surfaces. Subsequent to these findings, computational simulations were carried out in order to establish if the proposed borofloat material model could capture the prominent experimentally observed damage modes and the measured V50, reconfirming the experimental findings. In general, a good agreement was found between the computational and the experimental results.									8	0	0	0	0	8			1464-4207			WOS:000303498300004

In this research, three copper-based algaecide formulations were evaluated in terms of copper sorption to a specific problematic alga and amount of copper required to achieve control. The objectives of this study were (1) to compare the masses of copper required to achieve control of Lyngbya wollei using the algaecide formulations Algimycin-PWF, Clearigate, and copper sulfate pentahydrate in laboratory toxicity experiments; (2) to relate the responses of L. wollei to the masses of copper adsorbed and absorbed (i. e., dose) as well as the concentrations of copper in the exposure water; and (3) to discern the relation between the mass of copper required to achieve control of a certain mass of L. wollei among different algaecide formulations. The critical burden of copper (i. e., threshold algaecide concentration that must be absorbed or adsorbed to achieve control) for L. wollei averaged 3.3 and 1.9 mg Cu/g algae for Algimycin-PWF and Clearigate, respectively, in experiments with a series of aqueous copper concentrations, water volumes, and masses of algae. With reasonable exposures in these experiments, control was not achieved with single applications of copper sulfate despite copper sorption [ 13 mg Cu/g algae in one experiment. Factors governing the critical burden of copper required for control of problematic cyanobacteria include algaecide formulation and concentration, volume of water, and mass of algae. By measuring the critical burden of copper from an algaecide formulation necessary to achieve control of the targeted algae, selection of an effective product and treatment rate can be calculated at a given field site.									6	0	0	6	0	6			0090-4341			WOS:000302809400005	21968539

Small nanosheets enter cells mainly through clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and the increase of graphene size enhances phagocytotic uptake of the nanosheets. These findings will facilitate biomedical and toxicologic studies of graphenes and provide fundamental understanding of interactions at the interface of two-dimensional nanostructures and biological systems.									106	3	0	34	0	108			1944-8244			WOS:000303139900054	22409495

J	Kim, Min Su; Kim, Tae Hoon; Kim, Do Yoeb; Lee, Dong-Yul; Kim, Sung-O; Leem, Jae-Young								Effects of Annealing Atmosphere and Temperature on Properties of ZnO Thin Films on Porous Silicon Grown by Plasma-Assisted Molecular Beam Epitaxy								ELECTRONIC MATERIALS LETTERS				8	2			123	129		10.1007/s13391-012-1089-z			APR 2012	2012	Zinc oxide (ZnO) thin films were grown on porous silicon (PS) by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PA-MBE). The thin films were annealed in various atmospheres such as argon, nitrogen, and vacuum, and their structural and optical properties were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and photoluminescence. The ZnO thin films grown on PS showed a mountain-range-like surface morphology, whereas those grown on Si showed a typical 3D island surface structure. The thin films grown on PS exhibited only one diffraction peak at 34 degrees, whereas those grown on Si showed shoulders of the ZnO (002) diffraction peaks at around 33 degrees; this implies an excellent c-axis preferred orientation and a better crystal quality when PS was used. Large crystals were partially formed at an annealing temperature of 700 degrees C. The films annealed in a vacuum showed nanorod-like ZnO crystals, whereas those annealed in nitrogen and oxygen showed irregularly shaped crystals. It was confirmed that the structural and optical properties of the thin films were enhanced by the annealing process. In particular, relatively large changes in the full width at half maximum of the ZnO (002) diffraction peaks and UV emission peaks, indicating enhanced structural and optical properties, respectively, were observed when the thin films were annealed in argon.									10	0	0	0	0	10			1738-8090			WOS:000303287300005

Airport operators have introduced various passenger conveyances including moving walkways, escalators, and elevators to reduce passenger walking distance and provide an acceptable level of service. This research is based on a data collection effort in various airports and depicts an empirical study on the use of passenger conveyance systems in airport terminals. A logistic regression approach was applied to estimate a passenger's mode choice probability and to examine the relationship between passenger characteristics and their choice of automated conveyance systems in airport terminals.

Theoretical calculations predict that Bi should undergo a semimetal-to-semiconductor transition as at least one of its dimensions becomes < 50 nm. This prediction was experimentally confirmed by infrared (IR) absorption spectra, which is largely underlain by transitions between the L (electron) and T (hole) pockets of the Fermi surface. In this work, however, we report that in our nanosize samples, the observed IR peak positions are practically independent of temperature, which is hard to reconcile with the predicted behavior of the L-T transition. To help elucidate the origin of these IR peaks, we performed a careful analysis of the IR spectra of Bi nanorods, as well as those of bulk Bi, Bi samples prepared under different conditions and Bi-2(CO3)O-2 using Fourier transform infrared and photoacoustic spectroscopy measurements. We propose that the observed IR peaks in Bi nanorods arise from the oxygen-carbon containing secondary phases formed on the surface of Bi rather than from the Bi itself. We believe that secondary phases must be taken into account on a general basis in modeling the IR spectra of Bi and that the scenario that ascribes these IR peaks solely to the L-T transitions may not be correct. The results reported herein may also impact the research of Bi-based thermoelectric nanostructures and bulk materials.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1793-2920			WOS:000303335700002

Of these, 1027 (26%) were evaluated with at least 1 culture (blood, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid), and 276 (27%) of the evaluated infants had 414 episodes of culture-positive infection. Gram-positive organisms caused most of the infections (48%). The risk of death was higher in infants with positive cultures (odds ratio; 10.5, 95% confidence interval [7.2-15.5]) or negative cultures (4.8, [3.5-6.7]) compared to infants that were never evaluated with a culture (p<0.001). Mortality was highest with fungal infections (8/24, 33%) followed by Gram-positive cocci (40/142, 28%).Conclusions: Important predictive risk factors for early and late onset sepsis (birth weight and gestational age) did not contribute to risk of developing very late onset infection. Evaluation for infection (whether positive or negative) was a significant risk factor for death. GPC and fungal infections were associated with high mortality. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

J	Karve, Abhijit; Xia, Xiaoxia; Moore, Brandon D.								Arabidopsis Hexokinase-Like1 and Hexokinase1 Form a Critical Node in Mediating Plant Glucose and Ethylene Responses								PLANT PHYSIOLOGY				158	4			1965	1975		10.1104/pp.112.195636			APR 2012	2012	Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) Hexokinase-Like1 (HKL1) lacks glucose (Glc) phosphorylation activity and has been shown to act as a negative regulator of plant growth. Interestingly, the protein has a largely conserved Glc-binding domain, and protein overexpression was shown previously to promote seedling tolerance to exogenous 6% (w/v) Glc. Since these phenotypes occur independently of cellular Glc signaling activities, we have tested whether HKL1 might promote cross talk between the normal antagonists Glc and ethylene. We show that repression by 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) of the Glc-dependent developmental arrest of wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings requires the HKL1 protein. We also describe an unusual root hair phenotype associated with growth on high Glc medium that occurs prominently in HKL1 overexpression lines and in glucose insensitive 2-1 (gin2-1), a null mutant of Hexokinase1 (HXK1). Seedlings of these lines produce bulbous root hairs with an enlarged base after transfer from agar plates with normal medium to plates with 6% Glc. Seedling transfer to plates with 2% Glc plus ACC mimics the high-Glc effect in the HKL1 overexpression line but not in gin2-1. A similar ACC-stimulated, bulbous root hair phenotype also was observed in wild-type seedlings transferred to plates with 9% Glc. From transcript expression analyses, we found that HKL1 and HXK1 have differential roles in Glc-dependent repression of some ethylene biosynthesis genes. Since we show by coimmunoprecipitation assays that HKL1 and HXK1 can interact, these two proteins likely form a critical node in Glc signaling that mediates overlapping, but also distinct, cellular responses to Glc and ethylene treatments.									14	0	0	14	0	14			0032-0889			WOS:000303001400038	22366209

I argue that the republican interpretation fails to understand Ferguson's view of human action and thereby obscures his potential contribution to liberal theory This article offers a comprehensive account of Ferguson's concept of action, and emphasizes the instrumental and scientific aspects of his thought. Ferguson views politics as an accumulative project involving both political participation and non-political forms of activity. His thoughts on action and politics, therefore, reveal much about his view of the potential of non-political action and the ways it contributes to civil and political society.

J	Boylan, Gregory L.; Cho, Byung Rae								The Normal Probability Plot as a Tool for Understanding Data: A Shape Analysis from the Perspective of Skewness, Kurtosis, and Variability								QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL				28	3			249	264		10.1002/qre.1241			APR 2012	2012	Continuous quality improvement is an effort to improve the quality of products, processes, or services. A program intended to effectively implement such efforts begins with the collection and analysis of data. The primary purpose of the normal probability plot, which is one of the most frequently used graphical tools by quality practitioners and researchers, is for normality testing; however, the plot offers other valuable insights into data analysis that have rarely been addressed in the research community. This article provides an overview of distributional characteristics in the context of the four sample moments and investigates how variations in these moments affect the normal probability plot, focusing primarily on the presence of skewness and kurtosis and the effects of variability. This article then lays out a comprehensive analysis of how various statistical characteristics within a data set can influence the shape and corresponding properties of a normal probability plot, demonstrating how variations in the characteristics of the data can reveal or mask the degree of concavity, convexity, or the S shape in the plot, as well as the spread of the data about the mean and in the tails. This can provide engineers with a better understanding of the ways in which data communicate through the plot, thereby providing a better basis for initial assumptions, as well as facilitating more accurate model estimation and optimization results thereafter.

WACCM3 and Extended CMAM are both self-consistent general circulation models, which resolve general climatological features, while TIME-GCM can be forced to approximate specific conditions using reanalysis fields. GSWM is a linear mechanistic model; while GEWM is an empirical model derived from ground-based and satellite observations. The models resolve diurnal tides consistent in latitudinal structure with observations, dominated by the upward propagating (1,1) mode. There is disagreement in the magnitudes of the tidal amplitudes and vertical wavelengths, while differences in longitudinal tidal variability indicate differences in the nonmigrating tides in the models. These points suggest inconsistencies in model forcing, dissipation, and background winds that must be examined as part of a coordinated effort from the modeling community. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Data for the Carbon Footprinting of Rendering Operations								JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECOLOGY				16	2			223	230		10.1111/j.1530-9290.2011.00430.x			APR 2012	2012	This article presents a tool and data for calculation of the carbon footprint of rendering operations in North America, quantifying Scope 1 (direct) and Scope 2 (indirect) greenhouse gas emissions. Scope 3 (life cycle) emissions are not included.According to the sample data, in one year an average-size rendering plant in North America processes 100,000 tonnes (t) of meat by-products, fallen animals, and restaurant grease and produces 40,000 t of marketable fats and proteins. A plant of this size emits directly about 20,000 t of carbon dioxide (CO2), mostly by burning fuels to operate cookers that destroy pathogens, drive off moisture, and separate the fat and protein. Another 4,000 t of CO2 is emitted by utility companies to provide electricity for the rendering process. These direct and indirect emissions are equivalent to about 30% of the CO2 that would be released if all of the carbon in the rendered raw material were decomposed into CO2.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1088-1980			WOS:000302534800006

Previous research uses a repository of reverse-engineered function models to support conceptual-based design tools, such as similarity and design-by-analogy. These models, however, are created at a different level of abstraction than models created in conceptual design for new products. In this paper, a set of pruning rules is developed to generate an abstract, conceptual-level model from a reverse-engineered function model. The conceptual-level models are compared to two additional levels of abstraction that are available in a design repository. The abstract models developed through the pruning rules are tested using a similarity metric to understand their usefulness in conceptual design. The similarity of 128 products is computed using the Functional Basis controlled vocabulary and a matrix-based similarity metric at each level of abstraction. A matrix-based clustering algorithm is then applied to the similarity results to identify groups of similar products. A subset of these products is studied to further compare the three levels of abstraction and to validate the pruning rules. It is shown that the pruning rules are able to convert reverse-engineered function models to conceptual-level models, better supporting design-by-analogy, a conceptual-stage design activity.

In vitro MRI measurements made in agarose gel phantoms exhibited high relaxivity (18.26 +/- 1.04 mmol(-1) s(-1)). Controlled incubation of the nanoparticles with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) was used to study cellular uptake of these particles and this process appeared to be controlled by the size of the nanoparticle aggregates in the extracellular solution. SEM images of live MSCs showed an increased concentration of particles near the cell membrane and a distribution of the size of particles within the cells. Survivability for MSCs in contact with Mn-Au NPs was greater than 97% over the 3-day period and up to the 1 mM Mn used in this study. The high relaxivity and low cell mortality are suggestive of an enhanced positive contrast agent for in vitro or in vivo applications.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1388-0764			WOS:000302641000001

Modal analysis was conducted via a transfer matrix method to demonstrate the support of a single supermode in this structure with a large modal discrimination. The performance of the proposed structure against the phase variation is also investigated by calculating the modal loss with different strengths of phase variation. The scalability of this structure is estimated from the perspective of brightness in two situations: the fully correlated one and the adjacent-correlated one. A brightness saturation behavior is observed for the latter with a sufficiency of available emitters in an array.

Individual Variation in Male Size and Behavioral Repertoire in the Sailfin Molly Poecilia latipinna								ETHOLOGY				118	4			411	421		10.1111/j.1439-0310.2012.02025.x			APR 2012	2012	Variation among individuals in the expression of behaviors and associations of behaviors in different contexts can lead to the maintenance of behavioral polymorphisms. Individual variation in morphology is often associated with behavioral polymorphism, yet the degree to which morphology predicts behavioral phenotype is not well understood. We measured individual variation in size and behaviors in the sailfin molly, Poecilia latipinna, by comparing the behavior of individual males of different sizes across four different contexts (mating, exploratory tendency, sociability, and predator inspection). We also investigated the degree to which male size, a fixed genetic trait, influenced the expression of each behavior and associations between behaviors. We found that male mollies show strong associations between certain behaviors and only some of these are predicted by male size. For example, size has a strong influence on the courtship-boldness axis with larger males showing higher rates of courtship displays and being bolder in predator inspection. A positive association was found between exploratory tendency, sociability, and gonopodial thrusting rates, yet the expression of these behaviors was independent of male size. Thus, sailfin mollies, like many fish species, show associations of behaviors that contribute to differences among males in personality type. The fixed genetic effect of male size at maturity influences courtship and boldness, but individual variation in exploratory tendency, sociability, and sneak copulation attempts through gonopodial thrusts is independent of male size. Such variation among males in behavioral associations within and between different contexts may slow the rate at which populations of P.similar to latipinna can diverge in individual behaviors.									6	0	0	6	0	6			0179-1613			WOS:000301352900010

In Switzerland, the fungus was first found in a single apricot orchard in 2008. This study confirms the presence of M.similar to fructicola in nine out of 22 commercial orchards in Canton Valais, Switzerland. Five simple sequence repeat markers (SSRs) were developed for M.similar to fructicola and samples from Switzerland, Spain, Italy, France and the United States were analysed and compared in order to assess the genetic diversity of the pathogen, identify the origin of the disease, and verify if the fungus reproduces sexually in Europe. In the 119 European samples analysed, 12 different haplotypes were found, indicating a relatively high genetic diversity of the pathogen considering that the first report in Europe was 10 years ago. Three haplotypes found in Europe were identical to those found in the American samples (two from the east coast and one from the west coast). Population structure analysis suggests that the European population is derived from at least two invasion events probably originating from the US (one from the east coast, the other from the west coast).

From awe to satisfaction: immediate affective responses to the Antarctic tourism experience								POLAR RECORD				48	245			145	156		10.1017/S0032247410000720			APR 2012	2012	Antarctica is a rugged, austere, and yet stunningly beautiful continent with charismatic fauna including several species of penguins, whales, and seals. Mass media, writings from the early explorers, and modern film all describe firsthand experiences as delightful, beautiful, challenging, humbling, and even awe-inspiring. This dramatic allure of Antarctica now fuels one of the fastest growing tourism markets in the world with over 30,000 visitors annually traveling to the continent. Despite the fact that Antarctic tourism has occurred for over 30 years, little research has investigated the psychological and affective influence of these immersive tourism experiences in the Antarctic environment. This study explored visitors' affective judgments regarding their Antarctic tourism experience. An onsite post experience survey was administered to Antarctic tourists to investigate their satisfaction with a range of tour attributes. In addition, the researchers used the open-ended question, "How did this Antarctic experience affect you?" to explore tourists' affective response to their interaction with the Antarctic tourism environment. These open ended responses were coded using a priori themes generated from Kellert's environmental values typology. Additionally, each response was analysed for the presence of an awe experience. Further analysis revealed that tourists described five sub-dimensions of an 'awe' experience (nature-human relationship, spiritual connection, transformative experience, goal clarification, and sense of feeling humbled), with many individuals experiencing multiple dimensions of awe. Consequently, this analysis reveals that the impact of an Antarctic tour experience is powerful, rich, and extremely complex.									6	1	0	1	0	6			0032-2474			WOS:000301068500004

Non-invasive field measurements of soil water content using a pulsed 14 MeV neutron generator								SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH				120				130	136		10.1016/j.still.2011.12.009			APR 2012	2012	Current techniques of soil water content measurement are invasive and labor-intensive. Here, we demonstrate that an in situ soil carbon (C) analyzer with a multi-elemental analysis capability, developed for studies of terrestrial C sequestration, can be used concurrently to non-invasively measure the water content of large-volume (similar to 0.3 m(3)) soil samples. Our objectives were to investigate the correlations of the hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O) signals with water to the changes in the soil water content in laboratory experiments, and in an agricultural field. Implementing prompt gamma neutron activation analyses we showed that in the field, the signal from the H nucleus better indicates the soil water content than does that from the O nucleus. Using a field calibration, we were able to use the H signal to estimate a minimum detectable change of similar to 2% volumetric water in a 0-30 cm depth of soil.

Periocular recognition may be useful in applications where it is difficult to obtain a clear picture of an iris for iris biometrics, or a complete picture of a face for face biometrics. Previous periocular research has used either visible-light (VL) or near-infrared (NIR) light images, but no prior research has directly compared the two illuminations using images with similar resolution. We conducted an experiment in which volunteers were asked to compare pairs of periocular images. Some pairs showed images taken in VL, and some showed images taken in NIR light. Participants labeled each pair as belonging to the same person or to different people. Untrained participants with limited viewing times correctly classified VL image pairs with 88% accuracy, and NIR image pairs with 79% accuracy. For comparison, we presented pairs of iris images from the same subjects. In addition, we investigated differences between performance on light and dark eyes and relative helpfulness of various features in the periocular region under different illuminations. We calculated performance of three computer algorithms on the periocular images. Performance for humans and computers was similar.									26	2	0	1	0	28			1556-6013	1556-6021		WOS:000301506500021

The compounds crystallize in the cubic space group Im-3m with a = 12.1222 (14) and 12.3052 (14) for the K and Rb end members, respectively. This is only the second thorium fluoride reported as a single crystal structure to incorporate alkali and alkaline earth metals into the same structure. Crystals were obtained from the equimolar reaction of Ba(OH)(2)center dot H2O, ThF4 and ABF(4) in a 2 M AF solution under hydrothermal conditions (545 A degrees C and 1 kbar). Barium atoms substitute at the alkali metal sites and preferential site substitution is supported by the crystallographic analysis. Additional substitution at the alkali metal site has also been shown for K2.2Na0.8Ba2Th3F19 and K1.85Rb1.15Ba2Th3F19 using dissimilar alkali tetrafluoroborate and fluoride mineralizers in the reaction.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1074-1542			WOS:000301792600013

J	Grujicic, M.; Arakere, G.; Hariharan, A.; Pandurangan, B.								A Concurrent Product-Development Approach for Friction-Stir Welded Vehicle-Underbody Structures								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				21	4			437	449		10.1007/s11665-011-9955-7			APR 2012	2012	High-strength aluminum and titanium alloys with superior blast/ballistic resistance against armor piercing (AP) threats and with high vehicle light-weighing potential are being increasingly used as military-vehicle armor. Due to the complex structure of these vehicles, they are commonly constructed through joining (mainly welding) of the individual components. Unfortunately, these alloys are not very amenable to conventional fusion-based welding technologies [e.g., gas metal arc welding (GMAW)] and to obtain high-quality welds, solid-state joining technologies such as friction-stir welding (FSW) have to be employed. However, since FSW is a relatively new and fairly complex joining technology, its introduction into advanced military-vehicle-underbody structures is not straight forward and entails a comprehensive multi-prong approach which addresses concurrently and interactively all the aspects associated with the components/vehicle-underbody design, fabrication, and testing. One such approach is developed and applied in this study. The approach consists of a number of well-defined steps taking place concurrently and relies on two-way interactions between various steps. The approach is critically assessed using a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) analysis.									16	1	0	0	0	16			1059-9495			WOS:000301798800002

J	Moore, Lindsay J.; Fuentes, Latice; Rodgers, John H., Jr.; Bowerman, William W.; Yarrow, Greg K.; Chao, Wayne Y.; Bridges, William C., Jr.								Relative toxicity of the components of the original formulation of Roundup (R) to five North American anurans								ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY				78				128	133		10.1016/j.ecoenv.2011.11.025			APR 1 2012	2012	The responses of five North American frog species that were exposed in an aqueous system to the original formulation of Roundup (R) were compared. Carefully designed and un-confounded laboratory toxicity tests are crucial for accurate assessment of potential risks from the original formulation of Roundup (R) to North American amphibians in aquatic environments. The formulated mixture of this herbicide as well as its components, isopropylamine (IPA) salt of glyphosate and the surfactant MON 0818 (containing polyethoxylated tallowamine (POEA)) were separately tested in 96h acute toxicity tests with Gosner stage 25 larval anurans. Rana pipiens, R. clamitans, R. catesbeiana, Bufo fowleri, and Hyla chrysoscelis were reared from egg masses and exposed to a series of 11 concentrations of the original formulation of Roundup herbicide, nine concentrations of MON 0818 and three concentrations of IPA salt of glyphosate in static (non-renewal) aqueous laboratory tests. LC50 values are expressed as glyphosate acid equivalents (ae) or as mg/L for MON 0818 concentrations for comparison between the formulation and components. R. pipiens was the most sensitive of five species with 96h-LC50 values for formulation tests, for the five species, ranging from 1.80 to 4.22 mg ae/L, and MON 0818 exposures with 96h-LC50 values ranging from 0.68 to 1.32 mg/L. No significant mortality was observed during exposures of 96 h for any of the five species exposed to glyphosate IPA salt at concentrations up to 100 times the predicted environmental concentration (PEC). These results agree with previous studies which have noted that the surfactant MON 0818 containing POEA contributes the majority of the toxicity to the herbicide formulations for fish, aquatic invertebrates, and amphibians. These study results suggest that anurans are among the most sensitive species, and emphasize the importance of testing the herbicide formulation in addition to its separate components to accurately characterize the toxicity and potential risk of the formulation.

The biphenyl rings were post-functionalized with chlorosulfonic acid modification in the backbone of the perfluoropolymer, thereby changing the zeta potential (zeta) of the colloids across the pH range (2-12). Self-assembly of the colloids was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on four separate surfaces which led to different morphological changes for each surface; spherical on Al substrate, clover-like on Cr substrate, flower-like on carbon substrate, and "squalloid" on Si substrate.

Journal of manufacturing processes				14	2			98	106					2012-Apr-1	2012	Scale-up microsphere fabrication with controllable microsphere size has always been an exciting manufacturing challenge. The objective of this study is to experimentally study the effects of material properties and operating conditions on the formability of alginate microspheres and the microsphere size during drop-on-demand (DOD)-based single nozzle jetting. Alginate microspheres have been fabricated using bipolar wave-based drop-on-demand jetting, and its formability and size have been studied especially as a function of sodium alginate and calcium chloride concentrations, voltage rise/fall times, dwell and echo times, excitation voltage amplitudes, and frequency. It is found that 1) the formability is sensitive to the sodium alginate and calcium chloride concentrations, dwell and echo voltages, and voltage dwell time; and the formability decreases with the sodium alginate concentration but increases with the calcium chloride concentration, dwell and echo voltages, and voltage dwell time; 2) the size is not sensitive to the sodium alginate and calcium chloride concentrations but increases first with the dwell time and then decreases; and 3) the size increases with the dwell and absolute echo voltage amplitudes.									12	0	0	2	0	12			1526-6125			MEDLINE:22639550	22639550

J	Li, Xin; Rong, Guang; Thatcher, Jason B.								Does Technology Trust Substitute Interpersonal Trust? Examining Technology Trust's Influence on Individual Decision-Making								JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL AND END USER COMPUTING				24	2			18	38		10.4018/joeuc.2012040102			APR-JUN 2012	2012	While an increasing number of trust studies examine technological artifacts as trust recipients, there is still a lack of basic understanding of how technology trust relates to traditional trust and its role within the broader nomological net articulated in trust research. This paper suggests that technology trust is distinct from interpersonal trust (i.e., trust in humans) due to the different core characteristics of the trustees. To examine these differences, the authors first develop and validate a measure of technology trust comprised of IT-specific belief sources. Then, they articulate a research model that compares and contrasts technology trust and interpersonal trust. This study provides evidence that technology trust is associated with, yet distinct from, interpersonal trust. The authors found technology trust plays a dual role in the nomological net tied to individual intended behavior - exerting a direct and an indirect influence on a trust outcome. Rather than suggesting that technology trust substitutes for interpersonal trust, the findings suggest that technology trust complements interpersonal trust in affecting purchase intention.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1546-2234	1546-5012		WOS:000208914300002

Nursing forum				47	2			100	5		10.1111/j.1744-6198.2012.00260.x			2012 Apr-Jun	2012	PROBLEM: All nurses have the responsibility to deliver nondiscriminatory genetic health care. Patients perceive discriminatory nursing practices when they are being treated differently and unfairly. Nurses are expected to integrate genetic information about their patients into their clinical decision making. Thus, it is both timely and imperative that nurses have an operational definition of the concept "awareness of discrimination based on genetic information."METHOD: An operational definition of the concept was derived and Wilson's method of concept analysis was utilized to show how the operational definition may be applied in three different case models.FINDINGS: Awareness of discrimination based on genetic information can be operationally defined as "to know differences against people or distinguish between people based on the ancestral, heritable, communicated facts or knowledge".CONCLUSION: This concept analysis of words and terms used in genetic health care may serve as a framework for further genetic/genomics healthcare concepts under exploration.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1744-6198		MEDLINE:22512767	22512767

The experiments are conducted using a full size climatic chamber to host the test vehicle, to accurately assess the transient and steady state temperature distributions of the test vehicle cabin. Further investigate the thermal sensation (overall and local) and the human comfort states under artificially created relative humidity scenarios. The thermal images are calibrated through a thermocouples network, while the outside temperature and relative humidity are manipulated through the climatic environmental chamber with controlled soaking periods to guarantee the steady state conditions for each test scenario. The relative humidity inside the passenger cabin is controlled using a Total Humidity Controller (THC). The simulation uses the experimentally extracted boundary conditions via a 3-D Berkeley model that is set to be fully transient to account for the interactions in the velocity and temperature fields in the passenger compartment, which included interactions from turbulent flow, thermal buoyancy and the three modes of heat transfer conduction, convection and radiation. The model investigates the human comfort by analyzing the effect of the in-cabin relative humidity from two specific perspectives; firstly its effect on the body temporal variation of temperature within the cabin. Secondly, the Local Sensation (LS) and Comfort (LC) are analyzed for the different body segments in addition to the Overall Sensation (OS) and the Overall Comfort (OC). Furthermore, the human sensation is computed using the Fanger model in terms of the Predicted Mean Value (PMV) and the Predicted Percentage Dissatisfied (PPD) indices. The experimental and simulation results show that controlling the RH levels during the heating and the cooling processes (winter and summer conditions respectively) aid the A/C system to achieve the human comfort zone faster than the case if the RH value is not controlled. Also, the measured and predicted transient temperatures are compared and found to be in good agreement. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Generating equidistant representations in biobjective programming								COMPUTATIONAL OPTIMIZATION AND APPLICATIONS				51	3			1173	1210		10.1007/s10589-011-9403-5			APR 2012	2012	In recent years, emphasis has been placed on generating quality representations of the nondominated set of multiobjective optimization problems. This paper presents two methods for generating discrete representations with equidistant points for biobjective problems with solution sets determined by convex, polyhedral cones. The Constraint Controlled-Spacing method is based on the epsilon-constraint method with an additional constraint to control the spacing of generated points. The Bilevel Controlled-Spacing method has a bilevel structure with the lower-level generating the nondominated points and the upper-level controlling the spacing, and is extended to multiobjective problems. Both methods are proven to produce (weakly) nondominated points and are demonstrated on a variety of test problems.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0926-6003			WOS:000301181200012

At a delivery BMI of 35 kg/m(2), GDM exposure was associated with an average birthweight only 17 g (95% CI 4, 30) higher in NHW, but 78 g (95% CI 61, 95) higher in NHB (controlling for gestational age, maternal age, infant sex and availability of information on prenatal care). Figures for prepregnancy diabetes were 58 g (95% CI 34, 81) in NHW and 60 g (95% CI 37, 84) in NHB. GDM had a greater impact on birthweight in NHB than in NHW (60 g racial difference [95% CI 39, 82]), while prepregnancy diabetes had a large but similar impact. Similarly, the RR for GDM of having a large- relative to a normal-weight-for-gestational-age infant was lower in NHW (RR 1.41 [95% CI 1.34, 1.49]) than in NHB (RR 2.24 [95% CI 2.05, 2.46]).These data suggest that the negative effects of GDM combined with obesity during pregnancy may be greater in NHB than in NHW individuals.									13	0	0	8	0	13			0012-186X			WOS:000301182000014	22237686
