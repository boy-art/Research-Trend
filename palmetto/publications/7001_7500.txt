Demerouti, A. B. Bakker, F. Nachreiner, & W. B. Schaufeli, 2001, The job demands-resources model of burnout. Journal of Applied Psychology, 86, 499-512) and Conservation of Resources (COR) theory (S. E. Hobfoll, 2002, Social and psychological resources and adaptation. Review of General Psychology, 6, 307-324), we tested three competing models that predict different directions of causation for relationships over time between family-supportive work environments (FSWE) and psychological strain, with two waves of data from a military sample. Results revealed support for both the JDR and COR theories, first in the static model where FSWE at Time predicted psychological strain at Time 2 and when testing the opposite direction, where psychological strain at Time 1 predicted FSWE at Time 2. For change models, FSWE predicted changes in psychological strain across time, although the reverse causation model was not supported (psychological strain at Time 1 did not predict changes in FSWE). Also, changes in FSWE across time predicted psychological strain at Time 2, whereas changes in psychological strain did not predict FSWE at Time 2. Theoretically, these results are important for the work family interface in that they demonstrate the application of a systems approach to studying work and family interactions, as support was obtained for both the JDR model with perceptions of FSWE predicting psychological strain (in both the static and change models), and for COR theory where psychological strain predicts FSWE across time.									10	0	0	0	0	10			1076-8998			WOS:000313391900004	23276196

AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL-MACROECONOMICS				5	1			49	80		10.1257/mac.5.1.49			JAN 2013	2013	This paper re-examines the effect of oil wealth on political violence. Using a unique historical panel dataset of oil discoveries, we show that simply controlling for country fixed effects removes the statistical association between the value of oil reserves and civil war onset. Other macro-political violence measures, such as coup attempts, are also uncorrelated with oil wealth. To further address endogeneity concerns, we exploit changes in oil reserves due to randomness in the success of oil explorations. We find little robust evidence that oil discoveries increase the likelihood of political violence. Rather, oil discoveries increase military spending in nondemocratic countries.									45	0	0	1	0	45			1945-7707	1945-7715		WOS:000313109300002

In order to combat this pathogen, it is crucial to have an understanding of its natural interplay with the environment. For this reason, the free soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans was focused upon because of its shared natural habitat with Listeria and its potential as a model organism for Listeria pathogenesis. Previous studies have generated some contradictory results on Listeria's ability to kill C. elegans, making additional interaction studies such as this more attractive. In our study, we carried out a series of killing assays in a systematic manner using different Listeria strains under different growth conditions. In addition to studying the effects of planktonic cells, we examined the interaction between C. elegans and sessile listerial cells. Our findings suggest that, rather than causing infection and death, L. monocytogenes may extend the life span of C. elegans. This indicates that Listeria is not pathogenic to C. elegans. We also found that C. elegans can feed and ingest sessile cells, as well as carry the pathogen in its gut, implying that C. elegans could be a vehicle for L. monocytogenes spread in the environment.									6	2	0	6	0	8			0302-8933			WOS:000313004400003	22961596

The Sano operation is an alternative to the modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (innominate to pulmonary artery shunt). In the experimental setup, the single ventricle is simulated using a Berlin Heart Excor ventricular assist device and the Sano shunt is constructed by attaching a Tygon tube (6 mm internal diameter, 40 mm long) to the perforated de-airing valve of the Berlin Heart at one end, and to a pulmonary compliance chamber at the other end. The feasibility of the setup was verified by testing two rapid-prototyped patient-specific anatomical models (one without and one with aortic coarctation) under pulsatile flow conditions typical of Norwood patients. Results showed physiological and repeatable pressure and flow signals, as well as physiological values for pulmonary and aortic flow. Shunt flow was regulated by shunt size, and diastolic runoff through the shunt was also observed, both being features of Sano physiology. This system allows for comparing variations of first stage palliation of HLHS in vitro, and it also represents a source of data for validation of computational models.

J	Clayton, Donald D.								ANALYTIC APPROXIMATION OF CARBON CONDENSATION ISSUES IN TYPE II SUPERNOVAE								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				762	1					5	10.1088/0004-637X/762/1/5			JAN 1 2013	2013	I present analytic approximations for some issues related to condensation of graphite, TiC, and silicon carbide in oxygen-rich cores of supernovae of Type II. Increased understanding, which mathematical analysis can support, renders researchers more receptive to condensation in O-rich supernova gases. Taking SN 1987A as typical, my first analysis shows why the abundance of CO molecules reaches an early maximum in which free carbon remains more abundant than CO. This analysis clarifies why O-rich gas cannot oxidize C if Co-56 radioactivity is as strong as in SN 1987A. My next analysis shows that the CO abundance could be regarded as being in chemical equilibrium if the CO molecule is given an effective binding energy rather than its laboratory dissociation energy. The effective binding energy makes the thermal dissociation rate of CO equal to its radioactive dissociation rate. This preserves possible relevance for the concept of chemical equilibrium. My next analysis shows that the observed abundances of CO and SiO molecules in SN 1987A rule out frequent suggestions that equilibrium condensation of SUNOCONs has occurred following atomic mixing of the He-burning shell with more central zones in such a way as to reproduce roughly the observed spectrum of isotopes in SUNOCONs while preserving C/O > 1. He atoms admixed along with the excess carbon would destroy CO and SiO molecules, leaving their observed abundances unexplained. The final analysis argues that a chemical quasiequilibrium among grains ( but not gas) may exist approximately during condensation, so that its computational use is partially justified as a guide to which mineral phases would be stable against reactions with gas. I illustrate this point with quasiequilibrium calculations by Ebel & Grossman that have shown that graphite is stable even when O/C > 1 if prominent molecules are justifiably excluded from the calculation of chemical equilibrium.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0004-637X			WOS:000313007900005

We hypothesized that diabetes, by virtue of glycoxidation reactions, can directly crosslink implanted scaffolds, drastically altering their properties. In order to investigate the fate of tissue engineered scaffolds in diabetic conditions, we prepared valvular collagen scaffolds and arterial elastin scaffolds by decellularization and implanted them subdermally in diabetic rats. Both types of scaffolds exhibited significant levels of advanced glycation end products (AGES), chemical crosslinking and stiffening -alterations which are not favorable for cardiovascular tissue engineering. Pre-implantation treatment of collagen and elastin scaffolds with penta-galloyl glucose (PGG), an antioxidant and matrix-binding polyphenol, chemically stabilized the scaffolds, reduced their enzymatic degradation, and protected them from diabetes-related complications by reduction of scaffold-bound AGE levels. PGG-treated scaffolds resisted diabetes-induced crosslinking and stiffening, were protected from calcification, and exhibited controlled remodeling in vivo, thereby supporting future use of diabetes-resistant scaffolds for cardiovascular tissue engineering in patients with diabetes.

The Conservation Value of Secondary Forests for Vascular Epiphytes in Central Panama								BIOTROPICA				45	1			119	127		10.1111/j.1744-7429.2012.00883.x			JAN 2013	2013	Secondary forests that develop following land abandonment could compensate for the losses of diversity and structure that accompany deforestation of old-growth forests in tropical regions. Whether secondary forests can harbor similar species richness, density, and composition of old-growth forests for vascular epiphytes remains largely unknown for secondary forests older than 50 yr. We examined community structure (species richness, density, and species composition) of vascular epiphytes in older secondary forests between 35 and 115 yr after land abandonment and nearby old-growth forests to determine if the community structure of epiphytes in secondary forests approaches that of old-growth forests over time. The recovery of epiphyte species richness was rapid with 55-year-old forests containing 65 percent of old-growth epiphyte species richness. Secondary forest epiphyte communities were found to be statistically nested within secondary forests older in age and within old-growth forests. Similarity of epiphyte communities to old-growth forests increased to 75 percent, 115 yr after abandonment. This study suggests that secondary forests will likely recover old-growth epiphyte richness and composition given enough time. Epiphyte densities did not recover quickly with 55-year-old forests having 14 percent and 115-year-old forests having only 49 percent of the density of old-growth forest epiphytes. The low density of epiphytes in secondary forests could impact rainforest diversity and function. We conclude that in less than 115 yr, although secondary moist forests have high conservation value for some aspects of community structure, they are unlikely to compensate biologically for the loss of diversity and ecosystem function that high epiphyte densities provide.									15	0	0	15	0	15			0006-3606			WOS:000312993900015

Friction Stir Weld Failure Mechanisms in Aluminum-Armor Structures Under Ballistic Impact Loading Conditions								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				22	1			30	40		10.1007/s11665-012-0239-7			JAN 2013	2013	A critical assessment is carried out of the microstructural changes in respect of the associated reductions in material mechanical properties and of the attendant ballistic-impact failure mechanisms in prototypical friction stir welding (FSW) joints found in armor structures made of high-performance aluminum alloys (including solution-strengthened and age-hardenable aluminum alloy grades). It is argued that due to the large width of FSW joints found in thick aluminum-armor weldments, the overall ballistic performance of the armor is controlled by the ballistic limits of its weld zones (e.g., heat-affected zone, the thermomechanically affected zone, the nugget, etc.). Thus, in order to assess the overall ballistic survivability of an armor weldment, one must predict/identify welding-induced changes in the material microstructure and properties, and the operative failure mechanisms in different regions of the weld. Toward this end, a procedure is proposed in the present study which combines the results of the FSW process modeling, basic physical-metallurgy principles concerning microstructure/property relations, and the fracture mechanics concepts related to the key blast/ballistic-impact failure modes. The utility of this procedure is demonstrated using the case of a solid-solution strengthened and cold-worked aluminum alloy armor FSW-weld test structure.									8	1	0	0	0	8			1059-9495			WOS:000312712900004

Changes in nurses' decision making during a 12-h day shift								OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE-OXFORD				63	1			60	65		10.1093/occmed/kqs189			JAN 2013	2013	Although shift work is necessary in many health-care settings, research suggests that it can have detrimental effects on performance in health-care providers.To determine if a change in decision-making occurred across a 12-h day shift in a sample of registered nurses.The participants were nurses working a 12-h day shift (7 a.m.7 p.m.) at a large hospital in the south-eastern USA. Participants completed a policy-capturing questionnaire, examining their likelihood of calling a physician in response to specific patient symptoms, at the beginning and end of the shift. They also completed self-report surveys on alertness, stress and sleepiness.Sixty-five nurses completed the study, an overall response rate of 41%. Participants significantly changed their decision-making policies from the beginning to the end of the work shift and also became significantly less alert and more stressed. However, there was no correlation between decision-making and reported alertness and stress.These results suggest that medical judgment in registered nurses changed from the beginning to the end of a 12-h day shift. One possible underlying mechanism responsible for the changes seen across the shift could be the ability to maintain attention, as suggested by the Controlled Attention Model. The current results expand upon previous research, indicating there are a variety of negative outcomes associated with shift work.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0962-7480			WOS:000313126400011	23117169

We focus on the effects of the SGS mixing regimes and the spatial relationships among the scalars on the SGS mixing of the species mass fractions. High-resolution lines images are used to obtain the scalar filtered mass density function and the conditionally filtered diffusion. The results show that for small SGS variance the scalar fields have a relatively simple structure. For large SGS variance the structure is more complex. The spatial relationships among the scalars result in different SGS scalar structures and SGS mixing characteristics, with the mass fraction of CO2 being the simplest and that of CO being the most complex. The results in this study present a challenging test for SGS mixing models. (C) 2010 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

ATC decomposition and coordination incorporates compromise between the performance of the system and the demands of the subproblems reflected in their feasibility constraints. Optimal system performance regardless of subproblem feasibility may yield targets that are not achievable by the subproblems. Compromise is needed to accept deterioration of the optimal system performance and to increase the achievability of the targets. Biobjective optimization is used to reconcile system optimality and subproblem achievability of targets while solving the ATC-decomposed problem and generating an overall optimal solution. Three algorithms are proposed for two-level ATC-decomposed problems. The effectiveness of the algorithms is evaluated on mathematical and engineering examples. For a class of ATC problems, the performance of the proposed algorithms is superior to the performance of the ATC methods currently considered to be state of the art.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1615-147X			WOS:000312878800009

X-ray diffraction data indicated that mixed NiSe2 and TiSe2 phases were present after initial synthesis by solid-state reaction, but a pure TiSe2 phase was present after the spark plasma sintering. While EPMA data reveals the stoichiometry to be near 1:1.8 (Ti:Se) for all samples, comparisons of the measured bulk densities to the theoretical densities suggest that the off stoichiometry is a result of the co-intercalation of both Ni and Ti rather than Se vacancies. Due to the presence of excess Ti (0.085-0.130 per formula) in the van der Waals gap of all the samples, the sensitive electron-hole balance is offset by the additional Ti-3d electrons, leading to an increase in the thermopower (n-type) over pristine, stoichiometric TiSe2. The effects of the co-intercalation of both Ni and Ti in TiSe2 on the structural, thermal, and electrical properties are discussed herein. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Although the ThxCe1-xO2 binary indicates exsolution below 600 K, the energy gain due to exsolution is small (E-exsoln=1.5 kJ/(mol cations) at 200 K). The energy gain for exsolution is significant for the binaries containing Zr; at 1000 K, E-exsoln=6 kJ/mol cations) for the CexZr1-xO2 binary, and E-exsoln=17 kJ/(mol cations) for the ThxZr1-xO2 binary. The binaries containing Zr have limited miscibility and cation ordering (at 200 K for x=0.5). At 1673 K, only 4.0 and 0.25 mol% ZrO2 can be incorporated into CeO2 and ThO2, respectively. Solid-solution calculations for the tetragonal ThxZr1-xO2 binary show decreased mixing enthalpy due to the increased end-member stability of tetragonal ZrO2. Inclusion of the monoclinic ZrO2 is predicted to further reduce the mixing enthalpy for binaries containing Zr. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The article begins with the observation that the birth of organizational studies was deeply concerned with changes, problems and opportunities in an increasingly 'organized' world and argues that our studies should not abstract organizing from the world but use our conceptual and practical tools to engage the world fully. We offer six contemporary challenges for (critical) organizational studies in a global society: abstraction and virtuality, diversity and homogeneity, distinctiveness and linkage, boundaries and limits, transformations of labour/work and trust and cynicism. The article urges readers to consider in more specific terms how their work can not only illuminate these issues but also offer something practical, at whatever location or level of analysis, to make a positive difference in pedagogy, scholarship and wider community involvement.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1350-5084			WOS:000312692700007

G. 2013. Resistance to cyprodinil and lack of fludioxonil resistance in Botrytis cinerea isolates from strawberry in North and South Carolina. Plant Dis. 97:81-85. Chemical control of gray mold of strawberry caused by Botrytis cinerea is essential to prevent pre- and postharvest fruit decay. For more than 10 years. the anilinopyrimidine (AP) cyprodinil and the phenylpyrrole fludioxonil (Switch 62.5WG) have been available to commercial strawberry producers in the United States for gray mold control. Both active ingredients are site-specific inhibitors and, thus, prone to resistance development. In this study, 217 single-spore isolates of B. cinerea from 11 commercial strawberry fields in North and South Carolina were examined for sensitivity to both fungicides. Isolates that were sensitive (53%), moderately resistant (30%), or resistant (17%) to cyprodinil were identified based on germ tube inhibition at discriminatory doses of cyprodinil at 1 and 25 mg/liter at 10 of the 11 locations. None of the isolates was fludioxonil resistant. Phenotypes that were moderately resistant or resistant to cyprodinil were not associated with fitness penalties for mycelial growth rate, spore production, or osmotic sensitivity. Detached fruit assays demonstrated cross resistance between the two AP fungicides cyprodinil and pyrimethanil, and that isolates that were characterized in vitro as moderately resistant or resistant were equivalent in pathogenicity on fruit sprayed with pyrimethanil (currently the only AP registered in strawberry as a solo formulation). This suggests that the in vitro distinction of moderately resistant and resistant isolates is of little if any field relevance. The absence of cross-resistance with fludioxonil, iprodione, cycloheximide, and tolnaftate indicated that multidrug resistance in the form of multidrug resistance phenotypes was unlikely to be involved in conferring resistance to APs in our isolates. Implications for resistance management and disease control are discussed.									24	0	0	21	0	24			0191-2917			WOS:000312519200009

Expression of bacterial blight resistance in Brassica leafy greens under field conditions and inheritance of resistance in a Brassica juncea source. Plant Dis. 97:131-137. Brassica leafy greens are one of the most economically important vegetable commodity groups grown in the southeastern United States, and more than 28,000 metric tons of these crops are harvested in the United States annually. Collard and kale (Brassica oleracea Acephala group), mustard green (B. juncea), and turnip green (B. rapa) are the most commonly planted members of the brassica leafy greens group. In the last 10 years, numerous occurrences of bacterial blight on these leafy vegetables have been reported in several states. One of the pathogens responsible for this blight is designated Pseudomonas cannabina pv. alisalensis. Two B. rapa (G30710 and 030499) and two B. juncea (PI418956 and G30988) plant introductions (PIs) that exhibited moderate to high levels of resistance to this pathogen in greenhouse studies were tested for field resistance in comparison with eight commercial cultivar representatives of turnip green, mustard green, collard, and kale. The two B. juncea Pis and one of the B. rapa PIs (G30499) were found to have significantly less disease than all tested cultivars except 'Southern Curled Giant mustard green (B. juncea) and 'Blue Knight' kale (B. oleracea). Inheritance of resistance studies performed with populations derived from the resistant G30988 and two susceptible Pis provided some evidence that resistance may be controlled by a single recessive gene.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0191-2917			WOS:000312519200017

We present an endogenous growth model with imperfect credit markets and establish how improving the efficiency of these markets affects modes of production, innovation, and wage dispersion between skilled and unskilled workers. The experience of U.S. states following banking deregulation provides empirical support for our hypothesis. We find that wages of skilled workers increased by between 0.5% and 6.3% following deregulation while those of unskilled workers fell by between 3.5% and 8.7%. Similarly, residual (or within-group) inequality increased; the 9050 percentile ratio of residuals from a Mincerian wage regression and their standard deviation increased by 4.2% and 1.7%, respectively.

We tested the hypothesis that chemically mediated antagonism is a potential mechanism for structuring the bacterial community. In the co-culturing assay, 57% of the isolates expressed antagonistic behavior toward one or more isolates and 5% of the isolates inhibited more than 80% of the isolates. We observed greater levels of antagonism between isolates from adjacent laminae than within. The bacterial isolate library derived from the mat was predominately Gram-positive, and inhibition within this group was greater than against the few Gram-negative isolates. Microdiversity of 16S rRNA gene was observed for Bacillus marisflavi isolates, which represented 23 of the 75 isolates in the library. Within this and other groups, the patterns of inhibition and sensitivity varied greatly, suggesting rapid gain and loss of the ability to produce antagonistic secondary metabolites and resistance toward such molecules. Our observations are consistent with the hypothesis that antagonistic interactions are a potential mechanism in addition to physiochemical properties that regulate the vertical distribution of aerobic heterotrophic bacteria in hypersaline microbial mats.									5	0	0	5	0	5			0168-6496			WOS:000312295000007	22809069	
J	Reneke, James A.; Wiecek, Margaret M.; Fadel, Georges M.; Samson, Sundeep								Multidisciplinary design optimisation under uncertainty: an information model approach								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF VEHICLE DESIGN				61	1-4			249	284		10.1504/IJVD.2013.050848			2013	2013	The design of a multi-purpose vehicle capable of performing diverse missions in diverse environmental conditions requires a multi-disciplinary approach. Uncertain missions implied by a multi-purpose design goal and uncertain environmental conditions resulting from multiple operating theatres involve tradeoffs in vehicle performance. An information model approach to handling tradeoffs is presented. The design process is conceptualized as proceeding in stages. At each stage, the design problem is decomposed from the top down into design levels and interacting components having uncertain elements on each level. The components may require different knowledge bases and models with different mathematical structures, time and size scales, calling for higher-level coordination. Component performances are modelled as random functions of uncertainties considered as deterministic variables. Information models are developed making use of second-order statistics of the random performance functions and an algebra of their reduced-order representations. Decision-making proceeds from the bottom up. Higher-level design decisions, the result of tradeoffs between alternative component designs, are based on the information models of the component performance functions. Preferred overall designs are determined within a finite set of feasible designs by means of multi-criteria optimisation methods without using mathematical programming. The methodology is illustrated by a simplified two-component vehicle design problem.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0143-3369			WOS:000312002200013

Luo, Jian/A-4777-2008				Identification of a bilayer grain boundary complexion in Bi-doped Cu								SCRIPTA MATERIALIA				68	2			146	149		10.1016/j.scriptamat.2012.10.012			JAN 2013	2013	Using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, we have directly observed a bilayer grain boundary complexion in Bi-doped Cu, akin to that observed in Ni-Bi [Science, 333: 1730 (2011)]. In comparison with the Ni-Bi bilayer, the Cu-Bi bilayer appears to exist in a much narrower chemical potential window attributable to the fact that Cu-Bi and Ni-Bi have different pair-interaction potentials. Furthermore, these bilayers often form in conjunction with nanoscale faceting. This study demonstrates that direct imaging of the atom columns provides a more accurate understanding of the structure, chemistry and distribution of the adsorbates in a grain boundary and their role in embrittlement.

Recently, graphene has been proved to have superior thermal conductivity, which brought tremendous potential for nanoscale thermal transport management applications. In this study, we adopt the molecular dynamics simulation method to investigate the thermal conductivity variation of graphene with respect to chirality, strain, hydrogen doping and the deformation of the structure. We investigate thermal conductivity variation and various deformation modes of graphene under single-side patterned hydrogenation stripes. We show that graphene thermal conductivity can be tuned by deformation modes and hydrogenation doping density.					13th IEEE Conference on Nanotechnology (IEEE-NANO)13th IEEE Conference on Nanotechnology (IEEE-NANO)	AUG 05-08, 2013AUG 05-08, 2013	IEEE; IEEE Nanotechnol Council; China Assoc Sci & Technol; Chinese Acad Sci; Chinese Acad Engn; Chinese Soc Micro Nano Technol; Natl Nat Sci Fdn China; Natl Sci Fdn; Tsinghua Univ, State Key Lab Tribol; City Univ Hong Kong; NeoUnion ESC Org; Harbin Inst Technol, State Key Lab Robot Technol & Syst; Xian Jiaotong Univ, State Key Lab Mfg Syst Engn; Peking Univ, Natl Key Lab Sci & Technol Micro Nano Fabricat; Shanghai Jiaotong Univ, Natl Key Lab Sci & Technol Micro Nano Fabricat; Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Digital Mfg Equipment & Technol; N Univ China, Micro & Nano Technol Res Ctr; Pk Syst; German Tech; Zurich Instruments Ltd; Stella Co; Techcomp Ltd; AIXTRON SE; Pho Imaging Ltd; Nano Precis Corp; Nanopolis Suzhou CoIEEE; IEEE Nanotechnol Council; China Assoc Sci & Technol; Chinese Acad Sci; Chinese Acad Engn; Chinese Soc Micro Nano Technol; Natl Nat Sci Fdn China; Natl Sci Fdn; Tsinghua Univ, State Key Lab Tribol; City Univ Hong Kong; NeoUnion ESC Org; Harbin Inst Technol, State Key Lab Robot Technol & Syst; Xian Jiaotong Univ, State Key Lab Mfg Syst Engn; Peking Univ, Natl Key Lab Sci & Technol Micro Nano Fabricat; Shanghai Jiaotong Univ, Natl Key Lab Sci & Technol Micro Nano Fabricat; Huazhong Univ Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Digital Mfg Equipment & Technol; N Univ China, Micro & Nano Technol Res Ctr; Pk Syst; German Tech; Zurich Instruments Ltd; Stella Co; Techcomp Ltd; AIXTRON SE; Pho Imaging Ltd; Nano Precis Corp; Nanopolis Suzhou Co	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINABeijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	1	0	0	0	0	1					978-1-4799-0675-8; 978-1-4799-0676-5	WOS:000346488300202

This paper supports an interactive session that provides a wide variety of tools related to the use of quantitative, qualitative and mixed-methods approaches to evaluate how well and how much those involved in a community benefit from it. These tools are presented in the context of two different research studies where the evaluation of various community outcomes is a central goal of each study. Instruments used in each study and their validity for studying community are presented and provided in a manner readily transferrable to other researchers or practitioners who are studying the quality of community and community engagement. Challenges posed by human studies are also discussed. The goal of the session is to equip participants with the insight gained by these and related studies into the importance of community engagement and provide instruments for those involved in the development of communities to evaluate their own successes.

S	Benson, Lisa; Kirn, Adam; Morkos, Beshoy			ASEE					CAREER: Student Motivation and Learning in Engineering								2013 ASEE ANNUAL CONFERENCE		ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition												2013	2013	This project seeks to help educators understand factors contributing to engineering students' motivation to learn and perform academically, and to examine correlations between these factors and students' cognitive processes. Specifically, we are examining differences between student motivation factors in different engineering majors, and correlations between these factors and evidence of knowledge transfer when students are working on problems in contexts that are new to them. Understanding these relationships will address the challenges facing engineering educators: increasing interest in engineering, creating a more diverse engineering workforce, and preparing students for a future of rapid technological change and globalization.The first phase of this project involved identifying and understanding factors that contribute to engineering students' motivation to learn and succeed, and compare these for different student types (by demographics and choice of major). A quantitative study was conducted in which the Motivation and Attitudes in Engineering (MAE) survey was developed using achievement value as the theoretical framework. Three constructs were identified through factor analysis: Expectancy, Present Perceptions (students' perceptions of their present tasks in engineering studies), and Future Perceptions (students' perceptions of their future tasks as engineers). Survey responses over the course of the first year in engineering for a single cohort of students (n=959) were collected and tested for internal reliability and validity, and to analyze relationships between constructs and student retention and choice of major data two years later (n=424).Comparison of constructs over the course of the first year in engineering showed a significant decrease in expectancy, and significant increases in student perceptions about present and future. Binomial regression analysis revealed that students' perceptions about the future were significantly positive predictors of persistence in engineering. The interaction between perceptions about the present and future was a negative predictor of persistence. No significant differences were observed in motivation construct values by gender. The MAE survey and an informal Beginning of Semester (BOS) survey (used to assess how students choose their majors) were examined for differences in engineering student motivation based on major. While no differences in any of the MAE survey constructs were observed by major, differences in individual survey items were examined between majors grouped by overall features (traditional versus interdisciplinary). Students in interdisciplinary majors placed greater importance on making a difference and the availability of scholarship money, while students in traditional majors valued engineering work and designing and building things.This data is being used to identify appropriate frameworks for future research, such as extrinsic value (scholarship money), identity formation and possible selves (I know an engineer who I admire, or goal theory (benefiting society). These findings will help direct more in-depth qualitative research into student motivation, which will be followed by studies of how students with different motivational attributes transfer knowledge when working problems in contexts they have not seen before.

S	Drapcho, Caye M.; Crockett, Lib			ASEE					BT-ATE Pipeline for Progress: A Multi-Level Educational Plan for an Emerging Industry								2013 ASEE ANNUAL CONFERENCE		ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition												2013	2013	A dynamic and innovative Biosystems Technology (BT) curriculum was developed at the secondary, technical college and university levels. The curriculum includes core concepts in life science, engineering, technology and mathematics focused on applications in biological systems that transition student learning and depth of understanding from one level to the next. The program was successful in educating students with increased STEM knowledge, with an emphasis on engineering content, to prepare them for the technical workforce in the growing biofuels and bioprocessing industries. A highly successful aspect of this program was implementation of Summer Teaching and Learning Institutes for pre- and inservice educators primarily those in secondary agriculture programs in the state. The Institutes focused on the science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and agriculture of sustainable biofuels production and bioprocessing in the Southeast US. A major component of the Institutes was extensive hands-on instruction including fabrication, field and laboratory modules that utilized engineering and laboratory equipment that were provided to each participating inservice educator for use in his/her school. A total of 33 inservice and preservice educators participated in the Summer Institutes, with 19 educators participating for 2 or more years. These educators then incorporated the Biosystems Technology content into their courses of instruction. As a result, over the course of the project several thousand secondary students were directly impacted by enrollment in courses with Biosystems Technology content and more were impacted through career day and special event presentations. The response from participating educators concerning the Biosystems Technology material has been positive and transformative. Selected lessons have been implemented in SC agriculture courses and others (ie secondary biology and elementary) for four years.A second major accomplishment was the development and implementation of a secondary pathway in Biosystems Engineering Technology by project investigators and educational advisors. The pathway was submitted by the SC State Director of Agriculture Education for inclusion in the Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources Career Cluster. The four-course pathway, consisting of Agriculture and Biosystems Science, Biosystems Mechanics and Engineering, Biosystems Technology I and Biosystems Technology II, was approved by the SC State Department of Education in 2011. The Biosystems Technology Pathway was implemented in the Lexington-Richland 5 school district in the fall of 2012 at a Career and Technical Center. The secondary educator hired to lead the implementation of the BT pathway was a participating teacher on this project.

The I-3 (pronounced "I three") Experience programs aim to engage 9th-12th grade African American, Latino, and female students in research and prototyping activities to increase and sustain their interest in computer science. From Spring 2011 - Spring 2012, 64 students have enrolled in the I-3 Experience programs. Our program has specifically targeted female and underrepresented students (African American and Latino/as): 85.94% of program participants are female and underrepresented students; 61% of our students participated in free and reduced lunch programs. The program has a 71.79% retention rate.The I-3 Experience is a series of computing afterschool and summer-enrichment programs designed for students who are interested in exploring computing but lack courses at their school or have completed all the available Computer Science (CS) courses at their school and desire to expand their computing skills. The I-3 Experience consists of three program phases: Imagine, Investigate, and Innovate. Each of these program phases engages students in computational thinking and provides opportunities and resources for them to bring their ideas to life through the design of new applications and devices.Our goal in designing this program was to build on the success of existing K-12 summer camp outreach programs offered at Georgia Tech by offering students an opportunity to pursue their interest in CS through a constructionist and project-based curriculum. As we moved the students from exposure to personalization of the technology they developed, our aim was to increase the number of students desirous of enrolling in college as computer science majors. Our overarching goal was to increase the likelihood of students who apply to computer science undergraduate degree programs. This paper will discuss the program, strategies for program success, and enrollment and participation outcomes of this year long program.

S	Godwin, Allison; Potvin, Geoff			ASEE					Living in Two Worlds: Comparing Chemical Engineering Students to Other Engineers and Chemists								2013 ASEE ANNUAL CONFERENCE		ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition												2013	2013	Often, engineering students are treated as a homogeneous population in post-secondary education. This paper explores the differences between chemical engineering students and chemistry majors as well as students of other engineering disciplines. The data used were drawn from the nationally-representative Sustainability and Gender in Engineering (SaGE) survey. This survey collected responses from 6,772 students in first-year English classes during Fall 2011. The survey included topics covering students' experiences in their last high school science classes, beliefs about engineering and sustainability, as well as their demographics and prior academic performance.According to students' responses on their likelihood of entering a particular major, 123 students were identified as chemical engineering students, 691 students were identified as some "other" engineering students, and 251 students were identified as chemistry majors. We compared responses of the chemical engineering students with these two disparate groups respectively to identify differences in high school experiences, attitudes, and backgrounds using t-tests for linear variables, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for Likert-type questions, and chi-square tests for dichotomous variables.Chemical engineering students show uniqueness in their career goals when compared to both engineers as well as chemistry majors. For example, they differ significantly from other engineers in their prior chemistry experiences, problem solving strategies, and their science identity. Chemical engineers are almost indistinguishable from chemistry students in their high school science experiences and academic preparedness except for indicators of their physics and math identities. These findings have implications for student recruitment and matriculation into chemical engineering and the instruction of these students.

S	Godwin, Allison; Potvin, Geoff; Hazari, Zahra			ASEE					The Development of Critical Engineering Agency, Identity, and the Impact on Engineering Career Choices								2013 ASEE ANNUAL CONFERENCE		ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition												2013	2013	The choice of an engineering discipline upon entrance to college is often a partly informed decision. This paper explores the agency and identity of engineering students through the lens of critical engineering agency as a first step in the development of an affective model that describes the choice of engineering as a college major. The nationally representative Sustainability and Gender in Engineering (SaGE) survey was completed by 6,772 college students across the U.S. who were enrolled in first-year English courses during Fall 2011. The topics included in this survey covered students' experiences in their last high school science classes, beliefs about engineering and sustainability, as well as demographics and students' prior academic performance. Exploratory factor analyses were performed to identify measures of personal agency and global agency and validate the constructs of identity for use in a critical engineering agency model. These constructs were regressed on the choice of engineering and science. The results indicate that the combination of strong math and science identities paired with high personal agency can increase the likelihood of the choice of engineering. While students who pursue science and engineering have similar high school science experiences in terms of preparation before college, engineering students are distinguishable through their elevated math identities and personal agency over science students. These results indicate that preparation and recruitment of future engineers would be improved by focusing on the aspects of engineering which are relevant to students' sense of personal agency and incorporate math and science interests and experiences.

This cannot be adequately accomplished using outcome-based scoring methods. The purpose of this research was to test and refine an evidence-based method of assessing students' problem solving processes, and establish a tool that is robust enough to assess problems from a variety of contexts and formats.The assessment tool was developed using three well-defined story problems of various contexts for first year engineering students enrolled in an introductory course. Process analysis was applied to identify cognitive tasks used in successful solutions and common errors made in students' problem solving attempts. These tasks and errors were mapped to a six-category problem-solving cycle, enabling the evaluation of the problem solving process, identifying underutilization of key tasks and errors committed in each stage of the process.Results of testing and refinement of the assessment tool are presented in this study. Percent agreement and Cohen's Kappa statistics were calculated to assess inter-rater reliability between instructors using the assessment tool and to assess convergent validity between process analysis using the coding scheme and the modified process analysis using the assessment tool. The major advantage to the assessment tool over traditional grading methods is that it can provide personalized feedback to students about their level of problem-solving proficiency as well as pinpoint skill deficiencies that need attention.

Moreover, initiates just starting their post-secondary education in engineering may not perceive disciplines as practitioners do: they may identify and find affinity for features of an engineering specialty that may be different from actual practice.This paper conducts a comparative analysis of students at the start of their engineering studies using data drawn from a nationally-representative survey, conducted in 2011, of 6772 students enrolled at 50 colleges and universities in the U.S. By identifying students intending to major in eight different disciplines (bio-, chemical, civil, electrical/computer, environmental, industrial/systems, materials, and mechanical engineering), we show how student goals, values and self-perceptions differ. Regression analysis is used to study how the likelihood of entering one of these eight disciplines is associated to career outcome expectations, students' self-beliefs around their science, physics, and math identities, and constructs measuring their personal and global science agency.Results indicate that students intending to major in engineering show substantial interdisciplinary distinctions in the investigated domains. The utility of this work is that it should help to guide more effective recruiting of students into engineering disciplines and allow for a broadening of recruitment efforts to students who would normally be overlooked for engineering careers.

In this paper, an advanced education method for engineering technology students using the three-dimensional visualization of engineering concepts and object animation based on virtual reality technology has been presented for workforce development. The modeling tool set and selected automotive and aerospace system components were discussed to highlight the development process. A case study was introduced to illustrate the overall conceptualization and creation methodology, followed by the educational materials offered online to the technical college students for interactive learning. The preparation of students for emerging technical careers requires the successful integration of learning materials and channels delivery.

A survey was designed to inform how technical college students with different demographics use the Internet to gather such information. This survey was administered to 112 technical college students in South Carolina. The results suggest that 65.2% of the respondents are using Internet to gain access information. Interestingly, among the Internet adopters, students in the age group of 35-49 had a higher level of frustration when compared to other age groups. On the contrary, students in the age group of 18-34 experienced a higher level of effort when looking for correct educational information on Internet. 37.7% of the total respondents were active video game players. While 31.2% of the respondents reported to have played PC-based games and 69% of the students reported to have played games on a video-game consoles. This study calls for further research to understand the information seeking challenges of technical college students with a focus on the educational materials on automotive and aviation subsystems and manufacturing processes.

We propose a Linear Programming formulation that has a variable for each cycle in the graph. Since the number of cycles is exponential in the graph size, we solve our formulation via column generation. Computational results on some set of instances used in the literature show that our approach is promising. As it obtains a lower bound close to the optimal solutions 14 all instances.

For the first time, a generalized stability and optimality framework for this type of problem is proposed. In the proposed control design, the energy management problem, that by its very nature is a finite-time optimal control problem, is reformulated as a nonlinear-nonquadratic infinite-time optimization problem, leading to a family of state-feedback based control laws providing optimality with respect to an infinite time horizon performance functional while guarantee asymptotic stability.The analytical solution is obtained through a Lyapunov-based dissipative approach. The proposed optimal energy management control law is implemented in a pre-transmission parallel hybrid heavy duty truck and its performance is compared to the benchmark solution provided by the Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP). Reduced computational efforts and lower sensitivity of the control parameter, while maintaining performances within 2% from the optimal value, makes the novel control design a breakthrough in energy management control research.					52nd IEEE Annual Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)52nd IEEE Annual Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	DEC 10-13, 2013DEC 10-13, 2013	Honeywell; MathWorks; Springer; Taylor & Francis; Univ Trieste; Elsevier; GE Global Res; Natl Instruments; PendCon; Soc Ind & Appl Math; Wolfram; Journal Franklin Inst; United Technologies Res Ctr; Danieli AutomatHoneywell; MathWorks; Springer; Taylor & Francis; Univ Trieste; Elsevier; GE Global Res; Natl Instruments; PendCon; Soc Ind & Appl Math; Wolfram; Journal Franklin Inst; United Technologies Res Ctr; Danieli Automat	Florence, ITALYFlorence, ITALY	3	0	0	0	0	3			0743-1546		978-1-4673-5717-3	WOS:000352223507109

Both available power and cell life are functions of the local current allocated to each composite material, however there are no examples in literature of electrochemical-based models of composite electrode cells that are suitable for estimation and control. We present a reduced order, electrochemical model of a composite LiMn2O4 - LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 cell that predicts bulk and surface concentrations of each composite material, as well as the local current allocated to each material. Observability properties are analyzed by approximating the system as linear over certain operating conditions.

IEEE					Utilization of Channel Properties for Channel Access in Ad Hoc Networks with Heterogeneous Channels								2013 IEEE GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE (GLOBECOM)		IEEE Global Communications Conference						359	364					2013	2013	We consider an ad hoc network consisting of frequency-agile radios that have the ability to change their carrier frequency and transmission rate over a wide range of possibilities. The radios in this type of network are permitted to utilize multiple nonoverlapping channels, and each channel differs significantly in its characteristics, such as achievable data rate, communication range, and traffic load. We introduce a new channel-access protocol for this type of network such that the selection of a traffic channel for a data packet transmission considers characteristics of the channels such as data rate, range, and load. We show that by accounting for these channel characteristics, our protocol is able to maintain high network-layer performance in a wide range of scenarios compared to a channel-access protocol that assumes homogeneous channels (when in fact the channels are heterogeneous), and channel-access protocols that only consider the data rate associated with a particular traffic channel.

The number, variety and complexity of these bioinformatics tools have increased dramatically and they have become more and more computationally complex, expensive and resource intensive. Powerful workflow design systems have been developed to automate the execution of set of tools for a specific task. However, designing a complex executable workflow using such tools still requires considerable computational expertise or the help from a bioinformatics expert. In this paper, we developed Sesame, a bioinformatics semantic workflow design system. We have designed a new ontology for bioinformatics tools and services (OBTS) and proposed an ontology driven semantic workflow design mechanism, using this new OBTS. Compared to an executable workflow, the semantic workflow is at the level of biological concepts that are closer to the scientific research. Biologists will greatly benefit from the decoupling of semantic workflow design from executable workflow design with computational implementation details. Currently, a prototype version of Sesame system has been implemented and deployed. Sesame will allow biologists to efficiently perform complex data analysis to address scientific questions.

JUMMP enables an interactive pseudo-persistent Map Reduce platform within the existing administrative structure of an academic high performance computing center by "jumping" between nodes with minimal administrative effort. Jumping is implemented by the synchronization of stopping and starting daemon processes on different nodes in the cluster. Our experimental evaluation shows that JUMMP can be as efficient as a persistent Hadoop cluster on dedicated computing resources, depending on the jump time. Additionally, we show that the cluster remains stable, with good performance, in the presence of jumps that occur as frequently as the average length of reduce tasks of the currently executing Map Reduce job. JUMMP provides an attractive solution to academic institutions that desire to integrate Hadoop into their current computing enviromnent within their financial, technical, and administrative constraints.					15th IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER)15th IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER)	SEP 23-27, 2013SEP 23-27, 2013	IEEE; Cray Inc; Data Direct Networks; IBM Inc; Matrix Integrat Hewlett Packard; Indiana Univ Pervas Technol Inst; Natl Ctr Genome Anal Support; Case Western Reserve Univ; Univ Chicago Res Comp Ctr; Clemson Univ; Georgia Tech Informat Technol; Univ Miami Ctr Computat Sci; Mississippi State Univ; Univ Notre Dame; San Diego Supercomputer CenterIEEE; Cray Inc; Data Direct Networks; IBM Inc; Matrix Integrat Hewlett Packard; Indiana Univ Pervas Technol Inst; Natl Ctr Genome Anal Support; Case Western Reserve Univ; Univ Chicago Res Comp Ctr; Clemson Univ; Georgia Tech Informat Technol; Univ Miami Ctr Computat Sci; Mississippi State Univ; Univ Notre Dame; San Diego Supercomputer Center	Indianapolis, INIndianapolis, IN	0	0	0	0	0	0			1552-5244		978-1-4799-0898-1	WOS:000349249800046

Such film thickness is much thinner than the electron mean free path (MFP) of bulk gold. Pressure-induced surface deformation technique is developed to form 7 nm continuous films, which are thinner than the nominal percolation threshold of gold (i.e. 8 nm). The measured results show that such CPWs have less dispersion, but high loss when compared with thick metal CPWs. In addition to possible RF nanofluidic channel development, such CPWs provide a new approach for disordered electronic system studies.

Each device type was microlithographically fabricated from a pattern of sputter deposited metal (10 nm Ti/W vertical bar 100 nm Pt or Au) on an insulating substrate that was either glass or oxidized p-type silicon. Insulating regions were fashioned from Si3N4 and the gate dielectric of the FET was a SiO2 layer of 100 nm thick spin-on glass. For each biotransducer device type, the enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx) was immobilized using a process of electropolymerization of pyrrole (0.8 V vs. Ag/AgCl) in the presences of glucose oxidase (1 mg/ml) in deionized water to achieve a total of 100 mC/cm(2). The dose-response characteristics of each of the biotransducers were tested in muta-rotated glucose solutions (PBS 7.2) at RT that ranged from 0.0 mM to 20 mM. The sensitivity (m=slope), linear dynamic range and limits of detection [3(SDblank/m)] were calculated from replicate measures of the dose response curve.					12th IEEE Sensors Conference12th IEEE Sensors Conference	NOV 03-06, 2013NOV 03-06, 2013	IEEE; IEEE Sensors CouncilIEEE; IEEE Sensors Council	Baltimore, MDBaltimore, MD	0	0	0	0	0	0			1930-0395		978-1-4673-4642-9	WOS:000379846100248

Predictive modeling of power systems using conventional methods is time consuming and hence not well suited for real-time operation. In this study, neural network (NN) based non-linear predictor is used to predict states of power system for future time instance. Required control signals are computed based on predicted state variables and control set points. In order to reduce computation the problem is decoupled and solved in a cellular array of NNs. The cellular neural network (CNN) framework allows for accurate prediction with only minimal information exchange between neighboring predictors. The predicted states are then used in computing stability metrics that give proximity to point of instability. The situational awareness platform developed using CNN framework extracts information from data for the next time instance i. e. a step ahead of time and maps this data with geographical coordinates of power system components. The geographic information system (GIS) provides a visual indication of operating status of individual components as well as that of the entire system.

Such disempowerment can lead students to limit their engagement. This study explores how physics teachers can help students engage with the material and develop their physics identities by obscuring traditional classroom hierarchies. Employing a positionality lens on case studies of four high school physics teachers, we coded teachers' behavioral cues that contributed to the relational structure in the classroom. Our findings suggest that teachers' physical cues (space and hierarchical stance occupied), structural cues (dynamic nature of the classroom allowing alternating roles), contextual cues (including students' thoughts and experiences), and social cues (obscuring traditional boundaries between teacher and student) affect the social distance between the teacher, students, and content. This social distance can moderate students' level of engagement and ultimately their physics identity development.

From fifteen original items, we extracted eight factors covering over 50% of the total variance. Some of these factors were associated with gender and/or intended career field. The "communal values" factor is positively associated with the female gender and a life sciences career interest, and negatively associated with an engineering career interest. Furthermore, the "innovator" factor is associated with the male gender and an interest in physical sciences and engineering careers. Another factor strongly associated with male gender is "career as means to social recognition." These results are in line with existing research pointing to different goals for males and females when choosing careers: Females are more oriented toward communal behavior and a connection with real life, whereas males are more attracted by social recognition and power.

This framework was postulated to be comprised of performance beliefs, competence beliefs, recognition beliefs, and interest. Subsequent investigations showed that performance and competence beliefs are not distinct and the combined performance/competence construct is somewhat akin to Bandura's self-efficacy. Recent work has extended this framework to mathematics and engineering. We conclude with a brief discussion of the future of the framework for understanding "best practices" in STEM classrooms.

In addition, individuals with interdisciplinary thinking skills can be valuable contributors to modern research challenges by understanding and recognizing interdisciplinary connections and working in diverse teams. However, little research exists on the connection between interdisciplinary thinking and physics education. What aspects of physics classroom practices and experiences foster interdisciplinary thinking? What effect does interdisciplinary thinking have on the development of students' physics identities? Using a physics identity theoretical framework with data from a national survey, this study found that self-reported characteristics of interdisciplinary thinking are significantly correlated with higher levels of physics identity development. Also, several factors of the physics classroom environment and pedagogies are significantly related to interdisciplinary thinking.

For science, this includes bringing effective inquiry-based instruction into all classrooms as a means to engage the learner. However all inquiry instruction is not equal in terms of improving student achievement and conceptual development. This chapter explores how four critical constructs to learning (curriculum, instruction, discourse, and assessment) can be effectively measured and then used to guide more effective instructional practice. The Electronic Quality of Inquiry Protocol (EQUIP) is an instrument that can be used to measure and then to frame the discussion regarding the quality of inquiry-based instructional practice. Specifically, this chapter provides an overview of EQUIP, details the reliability and validity of EQUIP, shares a sample lesson that is analyzed using EQUIP, explores ways that EQUIP can help with teacher transformation relative to inquiry instruction, and addresses the relationship of EQUIP scores and student achievement data. Mere is a very high correlation between teacher performance on EQUIP and the ensuing student growth noted during an academic year.									0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4666-2810-6; 978-1-4666-2809-0	WOS:000364182600016

In order to begin this line of study, we look first to current practices in industry. A case study involving two companies provides examples of prototype use in the conceptual design phase of their respective product development cycles. Six interviews were conducted at two different companies in order to help understand how prototypes are used by industry during the conceptual design phases of a product development process. This research finds evidence that prototypes are being used successfully in conceptual design, even though typical literature sources advise against it.					19th International Conference on Engineering Design (ICED)19th International Conference on Engineering Design (ICED)	AUG 19-22, 2013AUG 19-22, 2013	Sungkyunkwan Univ, Creat Design Inst; Design SocSungkyunkwan Univ, Creat Design Inst; Design Soc	Sungkyunkwan Univ, Seoul, SOUTH KOREASungkyunkwan Univ, Seoul, SOUTH KOREA	0	0	0	0	0	0			2220-4334		978-1-904670-44-5	WOS:000364693700026

A challenge for the community is to ensure and evaluate the research quality, taking into account the variety of approaches. This paper explores four classes of evaluation criteria, truth value, applicability, consistency, and neutrality, based on interdisciplinary research literature. These are decomposed into several elemental metrics and distinguished by validation or verification type. The metrics are applied to two reported research studies (empirical and simulation) on similar topics. In the comparison, it is found that the authors of both papers explicitly addressed validation related criteria on the results of the research. However, the empirical study authors also included more details on the verification based metrics as they relate to the research process. The issue of how the verification and validation criteria can be operationalized according to the research method is identified as critical future research.					19th International Conference on Engineering Design (ICED)19th International Conference on Engineering Design (ICED)	AUG 19-22, 2013AUG 19-22, 2013	Sungkyunkwan Univ, Creat Design Inst; Design SocSungkyunkwan Univ, Creat Design Inst; Design Soc	Sungkyunkwan Univ, Seoul, SOUTH KOREASungkyunkwan Univ, Seoul, SOUTH KOREA	0	0	0	0	0	0			2220-4334		978-1-904670-45-2	WOS:000364698100019

This benchmarking protocol includes representation characteristics, supported cognitive dimensions, and enabled reasoning activities. Problem types are also defined as: reverse engineering, familiar products, novel products, and single-component systems. It is recommended that researchers and developers of function modeling representations work together to define a canonically acceptable set of benchmark tests and evaluations so that clear benefits and weaknesses for the disparate collection of approaches can be compared. This paper is written as a call to action for the research community to begin to look at establishing a benchmarking standard protocol for function modeling comparison purposes. This protocol should be refined with input from developers of the competing approaches in an academically open environment.					19th International Conference on Engineering Design (ICED)19th International Conference on Engineering Design (ICED)	AUG 19-22, 2013AUG 19-22, 2013	Sungkyunkwan Univ, Creat Design Inst; Design SocSungkyunkwan Univ, Creat Design Inst; Design Soc	Sungkyunkwan Univ, Seoul, SOUTH KOREASungkyunkwan Univ, Seoul, SOUTH KOREA	0	0	0	0	0	0			2220-4334		978-1-904670-45-2	WOS:000364698100023

With a focus on conceptual design, the paper provides a vision of design product modelling, relating research on function representations to work on ontologies, reasoning methods, and similar work in other domains. A series of three function-based representations is explored through an application to conceptual design of an additive manufacturing process. A comparison is offered of the types of information represented and reasoning supported by these representations, in light of the application. Finally, gaps are highlighted between the capabilities of these representations and the requirements for MEml to support conceptual design.					19th International Conference on Engineering Design (ICED)19th International Conference on Engineering Design (ICED)	AUG 19-22, 2013AUG 19-22, 2013	Sungkyunkwan Univ, Creat Design Inst; Design SocSungkyunkwan Univ, Creat Design Inst; Design Soc	Sungkyunkwan Univ, Seoul, SOUTH KOREASungkyunkwan Univ, Seoul, SOUTH KOREA	0	0	0	0	0	0			2220-4334		978-1-904670-49-0	WOS:000360584300004

In the globalization of engineering product development, these different approaches can introduce semantic challenges among the engineers. If the academic institutions are to educate future engineers for this global environment, then it is the responsibility of the institutions to begin to develop a shared, global understanding of central engineering issues, such as requirements and associated activities. This paper seeks to begin to reconcile and enrich these approaches by examining the activities that are supported through the steps and tools of each approach. Through this, it is found that there are opportunities for improvement in each, such by introducing (1) a requirement spreadsheet to the Grenoble approach for detailing meta-information and (2) the interactors graph to the Clemson approach to help guide engineers in discovering interaction centric requirements. Several other extensions and integrations are suggested to begin to develop a richer global approach, but a deeper study remains to justify and implement this integration.					19th International Conference on Engineering Design (ICED)19th International Conference on Engineering Design (ICED)	AUG 19-22, 2013AUG 19-22, 2013	Sungkyunkwan Univ, Creat Design Inst; Design SocSungkyunkwan Univ, Creat Design Inst; Design Soc	Sungkyunkwan Univ, Seoul, SOUTH KOREASungkyunkwan Univ, Seoul, SOUTH KOREA	0	0	0	0	0	0			2220-4334		978-1-904670-51-3	WOS:000361026200013

Engineering techniques, both computational and experimental, can aid in the understanding of the Norwood physiology and their correct implementation can potentially lead to refinement of the decision-making process, by means of patient-specific simulations. This paper presents some of the available tools that can corroborate clinical evidence by providing detailed insight into the fluid dynamics of the Norwood circulation as well as alternative surgical scenarios (i.e., virtual surgery). Patient specific anatomies can be manufactured by means of rapid prototyping and such models can be inserted in experimental set-ups (mock circulatory loops) that can provide a valuable source of validation data as well as hydrodynamic information. Such models can be tuned to respond to differing the patient physiologies. Experimental set-ups can also be compatible with visualization techniques, like particle image velocimetry and cardiovascular magnetic resonance, further adding to the knowledge of the local fluid dynamics. Multi-scale computational models include detailed three-dimensional (3D) anatomical information coupled to a lumped parameter network representing the remainder of the circulation. These models output both overall hemodynamic parameters while also enabling to investigate the local fluid dynamics of the aortic arch or the shunt. As an alternative, pure lumped parameter models can also be employed to model Stage 1 palliation, taking advantage of a much lower computational cost, albeit missing the 3D anatomical component. Finally, analytical techniques, such as wave intensity analysis, can be employed to study the Norwood physiology, providing a mechanistic perspective on the ventriculo-arterial coupling for this specific surgical scenario.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2296-2360			WOS:000209895600031

While stable and major QTLs across multiple environments and mapping populations are desirable, knowledge of population-specific and minor QTLs (particularly in traits controlled by only minor QTLs) are crucial for efficient and precise breeding. Sources of desirable traits lacking in cultivars require exploration in wild species as demonstrated in interspecific crosses in breeding programs and generation of multiple mapping populations. Utility of these findings for crop improvement are impeded by genetic-by-environment interactions, linked QTLs and interacting QTLs that have a tendency to alter complex traits in a manner that is difficult to predict. Besides the use of QTL linkage analysis, a LD-based association mapping strategy that exploits numerous ancient recombination events in diverse germplasms is now gaining importance for fine mapping QTLs as well as detecting polymorphisms lacking in bi-parental mapping populations. The availability of a Prunus reference map and the high genome colinearity among stone fruit species now present an unprecedented ease for comparative mapping, hence, the capability to validate conserved QTLs across several stone fruit species. While genetic improvement based on MAB approach is plausible for complex traits with one or two major QTLs, traits with several minor QTLs still remain intractable for breeding purposes using MAB. The decreasing cost of sophisticated and high-throughput techniques required for genomics-based breeding now offer promise for the genetic improvement of complex traits controlled by minor QTLs.									0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4665-6549-4; 978-1-57808-801-0	WOS:000381766000008

ASME					CONNECT: DATAANALYTICS FOR ENERGY EFFICIENT COMMUNITIES								INTERNATIONAL MECHANICAL ENGINEERING CONGRESS AND EXPOSITION - 2012, VOL 6, PTS A AND B								559	569					2013	2013	Energy efficiency is the lowest cost option being promoted for achieving a sustainable energy policy. Thus, there have been some innovations to reduce residential and commercial energy usage. There have also been calls to the utility companies to give customers access to timely, useful, and actionable information about their energy use, in order to unleash additional innovations in homes and businesses. Hence, some web-based tools have been developed for the public to access and compare energy usage data. In order to advance on these efforts, we propose a data analytics framework called Citizen Engagement for Energy Efficient Communities (CoNNECT).On the one hand, CoNNECT will help households to understand (i) the patterns in their energy consumption over time and how those patterns correlate with.weather data, (ii) how their monthly consumption compares to other households living in houses of similar size and age within the same geographic areas, and (iii) what other customers are doing to reduce their energy consumption. We hope that the availability of such data and analysis to the public will facilitate energy efficiency efforts in residential buildings. These capabilities formed the public portal of the CoNNECT framework. On the other hand, CoNNECT will help the utility companies to better understand their customers by making available to the utilities additional datasets that they naturally do not have access to, which could help them develop focused services for their customers. These additional capabilities are parts of the utility portal of the CoNNECT framework.In this paper, we describe the CoNNECT framework, the sources of the data used in its development, the functionalities of both the public and utility portals, and the application of empirical mode decomposition for decomposing usage signals into mode functions with the hope that such mode functions could help in clustering customer's into unique groups and in developing guidelines for energy conservation.

Survival of parrotfeather following simulated drawdown events								JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT				51				22	26					JAN 2013	2013	Non-native aquatic plants can often invade and rapidly outgrow native species in shallow water bodies resulting in the establishment of monotypic populations of the invading plant. Parrot feather (Myriophyllum aquaticum Veil. Verde.) is a non-native species that can be a nuisance in shallow water bodies. Therefore, we simulated a 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 wk winter and summer drawdown under controlled mesocosm conditions to evaluate the survival of parrotfeather with respect to seasonal and durational effects of drawdown events. The winter drawdowns did not affect (P = 0.89) parrotfeather survival. Parrotfeather survival was 68 to 80% between winter drawdown events. Conversely, summer drawdowns were much more effective (P < 0.01) with the exception of the 2-wk duration. Parrotfeather survival was 75% following a 2-wk drawdown and 18% following a 12-wk drawdown. The survival of parrotfeather in this study indicates that summer drawdowns may offer short-term suppression, as this species can withstand drawdowns of 12 wk. Longer drawdown durations or an integrated approach is required for complete control.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0146-6623			WOS:000209445600004

The latter are produced in more than 16,000 ha of protected cultivation greenhouses. These simple structures arc solar-heated and most commonly exist in one of two forms: a single-slope, east-west oriented lean-to style or a north-south oriented high tunnel. Both systems can significantly advance ripening date and increase profitability to the grower. With proper management, the solar lean-to houses and high tunnels can advance harvest by as many as 90 and 30 days respectively, compared to the same cultivars grown outside. This crop advancement can lead to as much as a 5-fold increase in selling price in the market.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1527-3741			WOS:000209232500004

Light, science & applications				2										2013	2013	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been cited as contributors to heart repair through cardiogenic differentiation and multiple cellular interactions, including the paracrine effect, cell fusion, and mechanical and electrical couplings. Due to heart-muscle complexity, progress in the development of knowledge concerning the role of MSCs in cardiac repair is heavily based on MSC-cardiomyocyte coculture. In conventional coculture systems, however, the in vivo cardiac muscle structure, in which rod-shaped cells are connected end-to-end, is not sustained; instead, irregularly shaped cells spread randomly, resulting in randomly distributed cell junctions. Consequently, contact-mediated cell-cell interactions (e.g., the electrical triggering signal and the mechanical contraction wave that propagate through MSC-cardiomyocyte junctions) occur randomly. Thus, the data generated on the beneficial effects of MSCs may be irrelevant to in vivo biological processes. In this study, we explored whether cardiomyocyte alignment, the most important phenotype, is relevant to stem cell cardiogenic differentiation. Here, we report (i) the construction of a laser-patterned, biochip-based, stem cell-cardiomyocyte coculture model with controlled cell alignment; and (ii) single-cell-level data on stem cell cardiogenic differentiation under in vivo-like cardiomyocyte alignment conditions.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2095-5545			MEDLINE:24527266	24527266

Published values for aboveground NPP range from about 700 to almost 1800 g m(-2) yr(-1), with considerable variation among sites, making some floodplain forests among the most productive forests of the temperate zone. Belowground productivity is more difficult to estimate than its aboveground counterpart, and thus, root productivity studies in forested ecosystems are rare. Fine root production can account for as much as 50% or more of the total NPP of hardwood forests, indicating that a failure to include belowground data might seriously underestimate overall forest ecosystem productivity. Reports of fine root productivity in bottomland forests are widely variable, ranging from < 100 to 1000 g m(-2) yr(-1) depending on location, hydrology, species composition, and sampling depth and technique. A variety of techniques to quantify components of above-and belowground productivity are described in this chapter. Allometric equations and tree diameter (determined through measurements of tree diameter, the use of tree dendrometer bands, or tree coring) are used to estimate woody biomass changes. Litterfall traps measure foliage inputs. Attempts to quantify belowground productivity in bottomland forests generally focus on understanding the fine root component through sequential coring, ingrowth techniques, or the use of minirhizotrons. The information provided about these different approaches should help researchers select the most appropriate technique(s) to estimate forest NPP.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1047-4986		978-0-89118-961-9; 978-0-89118-960-2	WOS:000370800500015

ASME					INVESTIGATIONS ON PERFORMANCE OF VARIOUS CERAMIC TOOLING WHILE MILLING NICKEL-BASED SUPERALLOY								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME 8TH INTERNATIONAL MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING CONFERENCE - 2013, VOL 1										V001T01A035				2013	2013	One of the most cost-effective dimensionally accurate processes used in manufacturing today, that is capable of producing a superior surface finish, is machining. As tooling wears, however, the advantages of machining greatly diminish. In addition, the time lost changing out the tooling significantly affects the overall process efficiency. Therefore, methods that decrease the wear rate of tooling and, thereby, increase tool longevity is essential to improving the efficiency of machining. Optimizing the machining feeds and speeds is one method that has been demonstrated to significantly increase the wear resistance of traditional tooling materials such as HSS, tungsten carbide and advanced ceramic tooling. However, the effects of machining feeds and speeds are not well established for gamma'- strengthened nickel-based superalloys. In addition, round geometry inserts were studied due to the rising popularity in industry, since there are an increased number of cutting edges. To help establish these effects, in this work, commercial grade SiAlON (Silicon Aluminium Oxynitride) and Si-WRA (Silicon Carbide Whiskers Reinforced Alumina) cutting inserts are compared. Milling tests were conducted on a gamma'-strengthened nickel-based superalloy. More specifically, tool life, machining forces and power were analyzed to evaluate the performance improvements of ceramic tooling. This study found that the abrasive/adhesion flank wear was the main failure mechanism of the ceramic inserts.					8th International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference8th International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference	JUN 10-14, 2013JUN 10-14, 2013	ASME, Mfg Engn DivASME, Mfg Engn Div	Madison, WIMadison, WI	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-5545-4	WOS:000349928300035

The current provides a degree of resistive heating, but also facilitates deformation by direct electrical mechanisms (teinied the electroplastic effect). It is envisioned that this approach, currently applied to bulk/sheet deformation, could also be used to reduce the flow stress in the deformation zone of the machining shear plane. The objective of this work is to study and model the effect of electric current on forces in machining in order to relate the force reduction to the current level and machining process parameters. To perform this, skiving tests and orthogonal machining tests are performed with varying electrical conditions. It is shown that application of electric current does reduce machining force by up to 60% under certain conditions.					8th International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference8th International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference	JUN 10-14, 2013JUN 10-14, 2013	ASME, Mfg Engn DivASME, Mfg Engn Div	Madison, WIMadison, WI	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-5545-4	WOS:000349928300059

Using this process, electric current level becomes a new degree of freedom for process control. In this work we present some alternative control architectures allowing for new avenues of control using such a process. The primary findings are architectures to allow for forming at constant force and forming at constant stress levels by modulating electric current to directly control material strength. These are demonstrated in a tensile forming operation, and found to produce the desired results. Combining these control approaches with previous and contemporary efforts in modeling of the process physics will allow for system identification of material response properties and model-based control of difficult-to-observe process parameters such as real time temperature gradients.					8th International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference8th International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference	JUN 10-14, 2013JUN 10-14, 2013	ASME, Mfg Engn DivASME, Mfg Engn Div	Madison, WIMadison, WI	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-5545-4	WOS:000349928300056

Moreover, GPUs can be much faster than CPUs (Central Processing Units) by performing hundreds or even thousands commands concurrently. This parallel processing allows the GPU achieving the extremely high performance but also requires using only highly parallel algorithms which can provide enough commands on each clock cycle.This work formulates a methodology for selection of a right geometry representation and a data structure suitable for parallel processing on GPU. Then the methodology is used for designing the 3-axis CNC milling simulation algorithm accelerated with the GPGPU technology. The developed algorithm is validated by performing an experimental machining simulation and evaluation of the performance results.The experimental simulation shows an importance of an optimization process and usage of algorithms that provide enough work to GPU. The used test configuration also demonstrates almost an order of magnitude difference between CPU and GPU performance results.					8th International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference8th International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference	JUN 10-14, 2013JUN 10-14, 2013	ASME, Mfg Engn DivASME, Mfg Engn Div	Madison, WIMadison, WI	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-5545-4	WOS:000349928300025		
B	Potluri, Hemanth; Jones, Joshua J.; Mears, Laine			ASME					COMPARISON OF ELECTRICALLY-ASSISTED AND CONVENTIONAL FRICTION STIR WELDING PROCESSES BY FEED FORCE AND TORQUE								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME 8TH INTERNATIONAL MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING CONFERENCE - 2013, VOL 1										V001T01A055				2013	2013	The process of friction stir welding involves high tool forces and requires robust machinery; the forces involved make tool wear a predominant problem. As a result, many alternatives have been proposed in decreasing tool forces such as laser assisted friction stir welding and ultra-sound assisted friction stir welding. However, these alternatives are not commercially successful on a large scale due to scalability and capital/maintenance costs.In an attempt to reduce forces in a cost-feasible manner, electrically-assisted friction stir welding (EAFSW) is studied in this work. EAFSW is a result of applying the concept of electrically-assisted manufacturing (i.e., passing high direct electrical current through a workpiece during processing) to the conventional friction stir welding process. The concept of EAFSW is a relatively new adaptation of conventional frictional stir welding, which is well established. The expected benefits are reduction in the feed force and torque, which allow for improved processing productivity as well as the possibility for deeper penetration of the weld.The effect of passing direct electric current through Aluminum 6061 during the welding process is studied in this paper with respect to the feed force and torque. From this study, it is shown that the feed forces are reduced by 58% on average in the EAFSW process compared to a conventional frictional stir welding process. Also, a decrease in torque at the start of the feed is present in the EAFSW process as compared to conventional friction stir welding.					8th International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference8th International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference	JUN 10-14, 2013JUN 10-14, 2013	ASME, Mfg Engn DivASME, Mfg Engn Div	Madison, WIMadison, WI	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-5545-4	WOS:000349928300055

ASME					MANUAL PRECEDENCE MAPPING AND APPLICATION OF A NOVEL PRECEDENCE RELATIONSHIP LEARNING TECHNIQUE TO REAL-WORLD AUTOMOTIVE ASSEMBLY LINE BALANCING								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME 8TH INTERNATIONAL MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING CONFERENCE - 2013, VOL 2										V002T02A021				2013	2013	An assembly line is a flow-oriented production system where the productive units performing the operations, referred to as stations, are aligned in a serial manner. The work pieces visit stations successively as they are moved along the,line usually by some kind of transportation system, e.g., a conveyor belt. An important decision problem, called Assembly Line Balancing Problem (ALBP), arises and has to be solved when (re-) configuring an assembly line. It consists of distributing the total workload for manufacturing any unit of the product to be assembled among the work stations along the line. The assignment of tasks to stations is constrained by task sequence restrictions which can be expressed in a precedence graph. However, most manufacturers usually do not have precedence graphs or if they do, the information on their precedence graphs is inadequate. As a consequence, the elaborate solution procedures for different versions of ALBP developed by more than 50 years of intensive research are often not applicable in practice. Unfortunately, the known approaches for precedence graph generation are not suitable for the conditions in the automotive industry. Therefore, we describe a detailed application of a new graph generation approach first introduced by Klindworth et al. [1] that is based on learning from past feasible production sequences. This technique foul's a sufficient precedence graph that guarantees feasible line balances. Experiments indicate that the proposed procedure is able to approximate the real precedence graph sufficiently well to detect nearly optimal solutions even for a real-world automotive assembly line segment with up to 317 tasks. In particular, it seems to be promising to use interviews with experts in a selective manner by analyzing maximum and minimum graphs to identify still assumed relations that are crucial for the graph's structure. Thus, the new approach seems to be a major step to close the gap between theoretical line balancing research and practice of assembly line planning.					8th International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference8th International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference	JUN 10-14, 2013JUN 10-14, 2013	ASME, Mfg Engn DivASME, Mfg Engn Div	Madison, WIMadison, WI	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-5546-1	WOS:000349928400021

Traditional force-based machining process control has been focused on single machine-single operation. The force or power sensor is used to measure the instantaneous force/power, and control action is taken by changing the feedrate in real time to follow a given force setpoint. The application of such control has successfully been implemented to prevent chatter and to elongate tool life by minimizing tool wear. This research seeks to extend the application of control algorithms to learn about the machining system (comprised in this context of a workpiece being operated on in progressive machining), and how knowledge generated by the process can be passed on to the next process for optimization. To demonstrate this, turning of a partially hardened bar is explored. A nonlinear mechanistic force model-based control framework attempts to control the cutting force at a designated setpoint, with material properties changing over the cut. The force coefficients for the material are calculated offline using experimental data and Bayesian inference methods. Since the hardened part of the bar will shift the force coefficient values, an online estimation strategy (Bayesian Recursive Least Square estimator) is used to learn the new coefficients as well as satisfying the control objective. With the newly learned coefficients passed downstream, the subsequent operation experiences no compromise of control objective as well reduces the maximum values of force encountered. Numerical analyses presented show the adaptation and control scheme performance.					8th International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference8th International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference	JUN 10-14, 2013JUN 10-14, 2013	ASME, Mfg Engn DivASME, Mfg Engn Div	Madison, WIMadison, WI	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-5546-1	WOS:000349928400026

Post-processing treatments at selected conditions were also performed on the ARB processed material, following each ARE processing cycle. Mechanical characterization and microstructural examination were carried out on the processed and post processed material to track the evolution of the microstructure, the changes in strength and ductility, and their relationships with regard to one another. Though the temperatures and processing conditions covered here are limited, it was found that ARB processing temperature affects the resultant flow behavior of the material. Furthermore, it was shown that post processing treatment of the ARE processed material can increase both strength and ductility of the material; the latter can be used as an effective tool for further controlling the structure and properties of the ARE-processed material.					8th International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference8th International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference	JUN 10-14, 2013JUN 10-14, 2013	ASME, Mfg Engn DivASME, Mfg Engn Div	Madison, WIMadison, WI	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-5546-1	WOS:000349928400040

DTNs do not have a complete path from a source to a destination most of the time. Previous data routing approaches in DTNs are primarily based on either flooding or single-copy routing. However, these methods incur either high overhead due to excessive transmissions or long delays due to suboptimal choices for relay nodes. Probabilistic forwarding that forwards a message to a node with a higher delivery utility enhances single-copy routing. However, current probabilistic forwarding methods only consider node contact frequency in calculating the utility while neglecting the influence of contact duration on the throughput, though both contact frequency and contact duration reflect the node movement pattern in a social network. In this paper, we theoretically prove that considering both factors leads to higher throughput than considering only contact frequency. To fully exploit a social network for high throughput and low routing delay, we propose a Social network oriented and duration utility-based distributed multicopy routing protocol (SEDUM) for DTNs. SEDUM is distinguished by three features. First, it considers both contact frequency and duration in node movement patterns of social networks. Second, it uses multicopy routing and can discover the minimum number of copies of a message to achieve a desired routing delay. Third, it has an effective buffer management mechanism to increase throughput and decrease routing delay. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that SEDUM provides high throughput and low routing delay compared to existing routing approaches. The results conform to our expectation that considering both contact frequency and duration for delivery utility in routing can achieve higher throughput than considering only contact frequency, especially in a highly dynamic environment with large routing messages.									9	4	0	0	0	13			0018-9340			WOS:000311846200007

In the co-culture system, increases of up to 52.3% for maximum cumulative hydrogen production, 38.4% for specific hydrogen production rate, 15.4% for substrate utilization rate, 39.0% for substrate utilization extent, and 34.8% for hydrogen molar yield in co-culture fermentation were observed compared to a pure culture of C. beijerinckii without AH2QDS. G. metallireducens grew in the co-culture system, resulting in a decrease in acetate concentration under co-culture conditions and a presumed regeneration of AH2QDS from AQDS. These co-culture results demonstrate metabolic crosstalk between the fermentative bacterium C. beijerinckii and the respiratory bacterium G. metallireducens and suggest a strategy for industrial biohydrogen production.

Nonetheless, the membership and market share of US credit unions have increased, though their average size has also risen. We investigate changes in the efficiency and productivity of US credit unions during 1989-2006 by benchmarking the performance of individual firms against an estimated order-alpha quantile lying "near" the efficient frontier. We construct a cost analog of the Malmquist productivity index, which we decompose to estimate changes in cost and scale efficiency, and changes in technology. We find that cost-productivity fell on average across all credit unions but especially among smaller credit unions. Smaller credit unions confronted a shift in technology that increased the minimum cost required to produce given amounts of output. All but the largest credit unions also became less scale efficient over time. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0378-4266	1872-6372		WOS:000311263700007		
J	Park, Chanseok								Parameter estimation from load-sharing system data using the expectation-maximization algorithm								IIE TRANSACTIONS				45	2	SI		147	163		10.1080/0740817X.2012.669878			2013	2013	This article considers a system of multiple components connected in parallel. As components fail one by one, the remaining working components share the total load applied to the system. This is commonly referred to as load sharing in the reliability engineering literature. This article considers the traditional approach to the modeling of a load-sharing system under the assumption of the existence of underlying hypothetical latent random variables. Using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, a methodology is proposed to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates in such a model in the case where the underlying lifetime distribution of the components is lognormal or normal. The proposed EM method is also illustrated and substantiated using numerical examples. The estimates obtained using the EM algorithm are compared with those obtained using the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm, which falls under the class of numerical methods known as Newton or quasi-Newton methods. The results show that the estimates obtained using the proposed EM method always converge to a unique global maximizer, whereas the estimates obtained using the Newton-type method are highly sensitive to the choice of starting values and thus often fail to converge.									9	1	0	0	0	10			0740-817X	1545-8830		WOS:000310959400003		
J	McLay, Laura A.; Mayorga, Maria E.								A model for optimally dispatching ambulances to emergency calls with classification errors in patient priorities								IIE TRANSACTIONS				45	1	SI		1	24		10.1080/0740817X.2012.665200			2013	2013	The decision of which servers to dispatch to which customers is an important aspect of service systems. Such decisions are complicated when servers have different operating characteristics, customers are prioritized, and there are errors in assessing customer priorities. This article formulates a model for determining how to optimally dispatch servers to prioritized customers given that dispatchers make classification errors in assessing the true customer priorities. These issues are examined through the lens of Emergency Medical Service (EMS) dispatch, for which a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model is developed that captures how to optimally dispatch ambulances (servers) to prioritized patients (customers). It is assumed that patients arrive sequentially, with the location and perceived priority of each patient becoming known upon arrival. The proposed model determines how to optimally dispatch ambulances to patients to maximize the long-run average utility of the system, defined as the expected coverage of true high-risk patients. The utilities and transition probabilities are location dependent, with respect to both the ambulance and patient locations. The analysis considers two cases for approaching the classification errors that correspond to over-and under-responding to perceived patient risk. A computational example is applied to an EMS system. The optimal policies under different classification strategies are compared to a myopic policy and the effect that classification errors have on the performance of these policies is examined. Simulations suggest that the policies remain effective when they are applied to more realistic situations.									4	0	0	0	1	5			0740-817X			WOS:000310596500001

Modeling such changes is a challenge and requires significant amount of computing time. From point of view of electrostatics, these changes can be viewed as a reorganization of local charges and dipoles in response to the changes of the electrostatic field, if the cause is insertion or deletion of a charged amino acid. Here we report a large scale investigation of modeling the changes of the folding energy due to single mutations involving charged group. This allows the changes of the folding energy to be considered mostly electrostatics in origin and to be calculated with DelPhi assigning residue-specific value of the internal dielectric constant of protein. The predicted energy changes are benchmarked against experimentally measured changes of the folding energy on a set of 257 single mutations. The best fit between experimental values and predicted changes is used to find out the effective value of the internal dielectric constant for each type of amino acid. The predicted folding free energy changes with the optimal, amino acid specific, dielectric constants are within RMSD=0.86 kcal/mol from experimentally measured changes.									139	8	0	21	0	139			1815-2406			WOS:000306807400003	24683422

In this work, two molecular surfaces are evaluated with respect to their suitability for electrostatic computation as alternatives to the widely used Connolly-Richards surface: the blobby surface, an implicit Gaussian atom centered surface, and the skin surface. As figures of merit, we considered surface differentiability and surface area continuity with respect to atom positions, and the agreement with explicit solvent simulations. Geometric analysis seems to privilege the skin to the blobby surface, and points to an unexpected relationship between the non connectedness of the surface, caused by interstices in the solute volume, and the surface area dependence on atomic centers. In order to assess the ability to reproduce explicit solvent results, specific software tools have been developed to enable the use of the skin surface in Poisson-Boltzmann calculations with the DelPhi solver. The results indicate that the skin and Connolly surfaces have a comparable performance from this last point of view.									16	0	0	3	0	16			1815-2406			WOS:000306807400005	23519863

Modeling the Influence of Salt on the Hydrophobic Effect and Protein Fold Stability								COMMUNICATIONS IN COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS				13	1			90	106		10.4208/cicp.290711.121011s			JAN 2013	2013	Salt influences protein stability through electrostatic mechanisms as well as through nonpolar Hofmeister effects. In the present work, a continuum solvation based model is developed to explore the impact of salt on protein stability. This model relies on a traditional Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) term to describe the polar or electrostatic effects of salt, and a surface area dependent term containing a salt concentration dependent microscopic surface tension function to capture the non-polar Hofmeister effects. The model is first validated against a series of cold-shock protein variants whose salt-dependent protein fold stability profiles have been previously determined experimentally. The approach is then applied to HIV-1 protease in order to explain an experimentally observed enhancement in stability and activity at high (1M) NaCl concentration. The inclusion of the salt-dependent non-polar term brings the model into quantitative agreement with experiment, and provides the basis for further studies into the impact of ionic strength on protein structure, function, and evolution.									10	0	0	7	0	10			1815-2406			WOS:000306807400006

Here we carry in silico analysis of the molecular effects causing such a difference and reveal the role of individual amino acids. It is shown that the computational modeling correctly predicts experimentally determined pKa's of histidine residues in an unbound state in the majority of the cases and the pH-dependence of the binding free energy. Structural analysis carried in conjunction with calculated pH-dependence of the binding revealed that the main reason for pH-dependence of the binding of hPRL-hPRLr-ECD is a number of salt-bridges across the interface of the complex, while no salt-bridges are formed in the hGH-hPRlr-ECD. Specifically, most of the salt-bridges involve histidine residues and this is the reason for the pH-dependence across a physiological range of pH. The analysis not only revealed the molecular mechanism of the pH-dependence of the hPRL-hPRLr-ECD, but also provided critical insight into the underlying physic-chemical mechanism.									5	0	0	4	0	5			1815-2406			WOS:000306807400012	24683423	
J	Brice, Allyn R.; Dominy, Brian N.								Examining Electrostatic Influences on Base-Flipping: A Comparison of TIP3P and GB Solvent Models								COMMUNICATIONS IN COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS				13	1			223	237		10.4208/cicp.210711.121011s			JAN 2013	2013	Recently, it was demonstrated that implicit solvent models were capable of generating stable B-form DNA structures. Specifically, generalized Born (GB) implicit solvent models have improved regarding the solvation of conformational sampling of DNA [1, 2]. Here, we examine the performance of the GBSW and GBMV models in CHARMM for characterizing base flipping free energy profiles of undamaged and damaged DNA bases. Umbrella sampling of the base flipping process was performed for the bases cytosine, uracil and xanthine. The umbrella sampling simulations were carried-outwith both explicit (TIP3P) and implicit (GB) solvent in order to establish the impact of the solvent model on base flipping. Overall, base flipping potential of mean force (PMF) profiles generated with GB solvent resulted in a greater free energy difference of flipping than profiles generated with TIP3P. One of the significant differences between implicit and explicit solvent models is the approximation of solute-solvent interactions in implicit solvent models. We calculated electrostatic interaction energies between explicit water molecules and the base targeted for flipping. These interaction energies were calculated over the base flipping reaction coordinate to illustrate the stabilizing effect of the explicit water molecules on the flipped-out state. It is known that nucleic base pair hydrogen bonds also influenced the free energy of flipping since these favorable interactions must be broken in order for a base to flip-out of the helix. The Watson-Crick base pair hydrogen bond fractions were calculated over the umbrella sampling simulation windows in order to determine the effect of base pair interactions on the base flipping free energy. It is shown that interaction energies between the flipping base and explicit water molecules are responsible for the lower base flipping free energy difference in the explicit solvent PMF profiles.									5	0	0	1	0	5			1815-2406	1991-7120		WOS:000306807400013

The local density of states at the end of the wire, which is directly related to the differential conductance in the limit of point-contact tunneling, is calculated numerically. We find that the dependence of the end-of-wire local density of states on the magnetic field is nonuniversal and that the signatures associated with the closing of the superconducting gap at the Majorana TQPT are essentially invisible within a significant range of experimentally relevant parameters. Our results provide a possible explanation for the recent observation of the apparent nonclosure of the gap at the Majorana TQPT in semiconductor nanowires.

We found that uncoated and surfactant-free silver nanoparticles derived from a laser ablation process promoted a maximum protein (bovine serum albumin) coating due to increased changes in entropy. On the other hand, bovine serum albumin displayed a relatively lower affinity for electrostatically stabilized nanoparticles due to the constrained entropy changes.

Storage change in a flat-lying fracture during well tests								WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH				48						W12528	10.1029/2011WR011571			DEC 22 2012	2012	The volume of water released from storage per unit head drop per volume of an REV is a basic quantity in groundwater hydrology, but the details of the process of storage change in the vicinity of a well are commonly overlooked. We characterize storage change in a flat-lying fracture or thin sedimentary bed through the apparent hydraulic compliance, C-f, the change in aperture of the fracture or thickness of the layer per unit change in pressure. The results of theoretical analyses and field measurements show that C-f increases with time near the well during pumping, but it drops suddenly and may become negative at the beginning of recovery during a well test. Profiles of C-f increase with radial distance from a well, but they are marked by a sharp increase and a sharp decrease at the edge of the region affected by the wellbore pressure transient. The conventional view in groundwater hydrology is that storage change at a point is proportional to the local change in pressure, which requires that the hydraulic compliance is uniform and constant. It appears that this conventional view is a simplification of a process that varies in both space and time and can even take on negative values. This simplification may be a source of uncertainty when interpreting well tests and extensometer records or predicting long-term well performance. Citation: Murdoch, L. C., and L. N.

T-12 is a characteristic temperature corresponding to a viscosity of 10(12) Pa.s, The glass was subject to quick temperature down-jumps preceded and followed by long isothermal holds. The exponential-like decay of the sample height was recorded and fitted using a unique Prony series method. The result of his method was a plot of the fit parameters revealing the presence of four distinct peaks or distributions of relaxation times. The number of relaxation times decreased as final test temperature was increased. The relaxation times did not shift significantly with changing temperature; however, the Prony weight terms varied essentially linearly with temperature. It was also found that the structural relaxation behavior of the glass trended toward single exponential behavior at temperatures above the testing range. The result of the analysis was a temperature-dependent Prony series model that can be used in finite element modeling of glass behavior in processes such as precision glass molding (PGM).									3	0	0	0	0	3			1089-5639			WOS:000312519800002	23185972

Development of high-productivity, strong cation-exchange adsorbers for protein capture by graft polymerization from membranes with different pore sizes								JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE				423				43	52		10.1016/j.memsci.2012.07.040			DEC 15 2012	2012	This paper describes the surface modification of macroporous membranes using ATRP (atom transfer radical polymerization) to create cation-exchange adsorbers with high protein binding capacity at high product throughput. The work is motivated by the need for a more economical and rapid capture step in downstream processing of protein therapeutics. Membranes with three reported nominal pore sizes (0.2, 0.45, 1.0 mu m) were modified with poly(3-sulfopropyl methacrylate, potassium salt) tentacles, to create a high density of protein binding sites. A special formulation was used in which the monomer was protected by a crown ether to enable surface-initiated ATRP of this cationic polyelectrolyte. Success with modification was supported by chemical analysis using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and indirectly by measurement of pure water flux as a function of polymerization time. Uniformity of modification within the membranes was visualized with confocal laser scanning microscopy. Static and dynamic binding capacities were measured using lysozyme protein to allow comparisons with reported performance data for commercial cation-exchange materials. Dynamic binding capacities were measured for flow rates ranging from 13 to 109 column volumes (CV)/min.

Here, we report results from a field study tracking the effects of contaminating oil across space and time in resident killifish during the first 4 mo of the spill event. Remote sensing and analytical chemistry identified exposures, which were linked to effects in fish characterized by genome expression and associated gill immunohisto-chemistry, despite very low concentrations of hydrocarbons remaining in water and tissues. Divergence in genome expression coincides with contaminating oil and is consistent with genome responses that are predictive of exposure to hydrocarbon-like chemicals and indicative of physiological and reproductive impairment. Oil-contaminated waters are also associated with aberrant protein expression in gill tissues of larval and adult fish. These data suggest that heavily weathered crude oil from the spill imparts significant biological impacts in sensitive Louisiana marshes, some of which remain for over 2 mo following initial exposures.									77	0	0	74	0	79			0027-8424			WOS:000312605600039	21949382

The plasma treatment could provide several advantages to the growth of multiple-stack ZnO nanoflower/nanorod structures: (i) the surface wettability of the seed layers changes from hydrophobic to hydrophilic, resulting in higher surface energies for the growth of high-density ZnO nanoflowers, (ii) the nucleation sites increase due to the increased surface roughness caused by the plasma etching, and (iii) there is no thermal damage to the plastic substrate from the plasma treatment due to its low-temperature weakly ionized discharge. It was also confirmed that multiple stacks of ZnO nanoflowers were obtained without degradation of the crystal quality or modification to the crystal shape or phase. The ZnO nanoflower/nanorod structures grew by lengths up to 4 mu m due to an increased surface roughness of 10% and surface energy 5.5 times that of the seed layers. As shown, the APPJ is a very good method to obtain high-density ZnO nanostructures on plastic substrates below 150 degrees C, as is critical for flexible electronics.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0957-4484			WOS:000311138100032	23128124	
J	Smith, Nicholas; Campbell, Brandon; Li, Lin; Li, Chuan; Alexov, Emil								Protein Nano-Object Integrator (ProNOI) for generating atomic style objects for molecular modeling								BMC STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY				12						31	10.1186/1472-6807-12-31			DEC 5 2012	2012	Background: With the progress of nanotechnology, one frequently has to model biological macromolecules simultaneously with nano-objects. However, the atomic structures of the nano objects are typically not available or they are solid state entities. Because of that, the researchers have to investigate such nano systems by generating models of the nano objects in a manner that the existing software be able to carry the simulations. In addition, it should allow generating composite objects with complex shape by combining basic geometrical figures and embedding biological macromolecules within the system.Results: Here we report the Protein Nano-Object Integrator (ProNOI) which allows for generating atomic-style geometrical objects with user desired shape and dimensions. Unlimited number of objects can be created and combined with biological macromolecules in Protein Data Bank (PDB) format file. Once the objects are generated, the users can use sliders to manipulate their shape, dimension and absolute position. In addition, the software offers the option to charge the objects with either specified surface or volumetric charge density and to model them with user-desired dielectric constants. According to the user preference, the biological macromolecule atoms can be assigned charges and radii according to four different force fields: Amber, Charmm, OPLS and PARSE. The biological macromolecules and the atomic-style objects are exported as a position, charge and radius (PQR) file, or if a default dielectric constant distribution is not selected, it is exported as a position, charge, radius and epsilon (PQRE) file. As illustration of the capabilities of the ProNOI, we created a composite object in a shape of a robot, aptly named the Clemson Robot, whose parts are charged with various volumetric charge densities and holds the barnase-barstar protein complex in its hand.Conclusions: The Protein Nano-Object Integrator (ProNOI) is a convenient tool for generating atomic-style nano shapes in conjunction with biological macromolecule(s). Charges and radii on the macromolecule atoms and the atoms in the shapes are assigned according to the user's preferences allowing various scenarios of modeling. The default output file is in PQR (PQRE) format which is readable by almost any software available in biophysical field.

Spectroscopic, Voltammetric, Electron Spin Resonance Spectroelectrochemical, and Extended Density Functional Theory Study of Sc4O2@C-80 and Its Ion Radicals								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY				134	48			19607	19618		10.1021/ja306728p			DEC 5 2012	2012	The clusterfullerene Sc4O2@C-80 with a mixed redox state of scandium was found to be an exciting molecule for endohedral electrochemistry as demonstrated by means of an in situ electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroelectrochemical study of the spin density distribution in its electrochemically generated cation and anion radicals. The compound exhibits two reversible reduction and oxidation steps with a relatively small electrochemical gap of 1.10 V. The ESR spectra of the ion radicals have a rich hyperfine structure caused by two pairs of equivalent Sc atoms. The Sc-based hyperfine structure with large hyperfine coupling constants shows that both oxidation and reduction of Sc4O2@C-80 are in cavea redox processes, which is the subject of endohedral electrochemistry. The assignment of the experimentally determined a(Sc-45) values to the two types of Sc atoms in the Sc4O2 cluster was accomplished by extended density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations. Sc atoms adopting a divalent state in the neutral Sc4O2@C-80 exhibited an especially large coupling constant of 150.4 G in the cation radical, which is the record high a(Sc-45) value for Sc-based endohedral metallofullerenes. Such a high value is explained by the nature of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) localized on the six-atom Sc4O2 cluster. This HOMO is a Sc-Sc bonding MO and hence has large contributions from the 4s atomic orbitals of Sc-11. We claim that ESR spectroelectrochemistry is an invaluable experimental tool in the studies of metal-metal bonding in endohedral metallofullerenes and in endohedral electrochemistry.									36	0	0	1	0	36			0002-7863			WOS:000311869600028	22924339	
J	Kong, Fanting; Dong, Liang								Precise tailoring of acoustic velocity in optical fibers by hydrogenation and UV exposure								OPTICS EXPRESS				20	25			27810	27819		10.1364/OE.20.027810			DEC 3 2012	2012	Tailoring of acoustic properties in solids has many potential applications in both acoustics, i.e. acoustic gratings and waveguides, and photon-phonon interactions, i.e. stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS). One immediate application is in the area of SBS suppression in optical fibers. We demonstrate, for the first time, a post-processing technique where hydrogen is diffused in to a fiber core and then locally and permanently bonded to core glass by a subsequent UV exposure. It is discovered that local acoustic velocity can be altered by as much as similar to 2% this way, with strong potential for much further improvements with an increased hydrogen pressure. It is also found that the large change in acoustic velocity is primarily due to a reduction in bulk modulus, possibly as a result of network bonds being broken up by the addition of OH bonds. It is possible to use this technique to precisely tailor acoustic velocity along a fiber for more optimized SBS suppression in a fiber amplifier. Change in Brillouin Stokes frequency of similar to 320MHz at 1.064 mu m was observed. (C)2012 Optical Society of America									0	0	0	0	0	0			1094-4087			WOS:000314746600056	23262726

In the proposed approach, a pile of objects lies on a flat background, and the goal of the robot is to isolate, interact with, and classify each object so that its properties can be obtained. The algorithm considers each object to be classified using color, shape, and flexibility. The approach works with a variety of objects relevant to service robot applications, including both rigid objects such as bottles, cans, and pliers as well as non-rigid objects such as soft toy animals, socks, and shoes. Experiments on a number of different piles of objects demonstrate the ability of efficiently isolating and classifying each item through interaction.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1729-8814			WOS:000312909400001

The harmonic generation of the flapping mode produces a comb-like frequency mixing spectrum. Instead of using the external pump modulation, we show that the regenerative oscillation of an internal mechanical mode can be used as a modulation source for optomechanical RF mixing.

It has been found that replacement of TaO5/2 by ZnO does not significantly modify the respective proportion of TeO4, TeO3 and TeO3+1 entities but induces an important decrease of the TeO4 structural units Raman cross section. Change of the glass structure at the middle range length scale is proposed to be at the origin of the large decrease of the Raman cross section of the TeO4 units. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Induction of Glutaredoxin Expression in Response to Desiccation Stress in the Foliar Nematode Aphelenchoides fragariae								JOURNAL OF NEMATOLOGY				44	4			370	376					DEC 2012	2012	Desiccation tolerance plays an important role in the overwinter survival of the foliar nematode Aphelenchoides fragariae. Survival rates of A. fragariae were compared with those of the anhydrobiotic soil-dwelling nematode Aphelenchus avenae after desiccation (90% RH), cold (4 degrees C) and osmotic (500 mM sucrose) stress treatments. A. fragariae formed aggregates during desiccation and showed higher survival rates than A. avenae under desiccation and osmotic stress. Analysis of transcripts with Illumina RNA-seq indicated that glutaredoxin and other antioxidant-related genes were up-regulated under desiccation stress. Quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated 2.8 fold and 1.3 fold up-regulation of a glutaredoxin gene under desiccated and osmotic stress, respectively, suggesting the participation of antioxidant mechanisms in desiccation tolerance of A. fragariae.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0022-300X			WOS:000320452400008	23483835

Wildlife Biology in Practice				8	2			9	19					Dec 2012	2012	Financial incentives and economic factors play a role in expansion and survival of waterfowl in the Upstate of South Carolina. Satisfying a basic biological need, waterfowl impoundments are an effective way to ensure that migrating ducks have a food source, cover, and water on their journey south during the winter months (duck hunting season), but also year-round to ensure these birds return annually. Development of the region's rural areas has resulted in a decrease in total area of flooded wetlands designated to waterfowl and a decline in waterfowl populations. At the same time, the willingness to pay to hunt ducks has escalated. South Carolinians drive across the United States in search for duck hunting when the same hunting experience could be created in their own backyard. The incremental value of creating a waterfowl impoundment was determined on five different properties in the Upstate of South Carolina (the study area). A discounted cost flow analysis approach was used that considered initial costs (a pond leveler, site preparation work, and blind building), recurring costs, and hunter revenue. The model also considered the opportunity cost of foregoing the harvest of planted crops on the land. Realistic examples are provided with corresponding net present values and geographic information system generated maps illustrate the layout of these impoundments. Waterfowl impoundments were found to produce significant financial return.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1646-2742			ZOOREC:ZOOR14909040239

Species diversity within habitats was analyzed with five diversity indices including Diversity index (H'), Evenness (J'), Richness (SR), Dominance (l) and Diversity (H-2). The results revealed a remarkably high diversity of 24 nematode species belonging to 19 genera and 11 families. Of those, 23 species were found in SC, 19 species in NC, and 18 species were detected in both states. Helicotylenchus dihystera, Mesocriconema xenoplax, Hoplolaimus galeatus, Tylenchorhynchus claytoni, Belonolaimus longicaudatus, Meloidogyne graminis and Paratrichodorus minor were the most prevalent and abundant species in golf course turfgrasses in both states. Twelve species were new records of plant parasitic nematodes in turfgrasses in both NC and SC. The results also revealed effects of different habitats on diversity of nematode species in turfgrass ecosystem. H' and SR values were higher in SC than in NC. H', J' and H-2 values were significantly higher in sandy than in clay soil in NC, but no significant differences between sand and clay soil were detected in SC or in pooled data from both states. There were no significant differences for all indices among the management zones (putting green, fairway and tee) in NC. However, in SC and pooled data, H', SR and H-2 were significantly higher in putting greens than in fairways and tees. Significant differences from different grass species (bermudagrass, creeping bentgrass and zoysiagrass) were detected only in H', which was significantly higher in zoysiagrass than in bentgrass or bermudagrass in NC. In pooled data, H' was significantly higher in zoysiagrass samples than in creeping bentgrass samples but was not significantly different from bermudagrass samples.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0022-300X			WOS:000320452400005	23482422

Dietary supplementation of conjugated linoleic acid in horses increases plasma conjugated linoleic acid and decreases plasma arachidonic acid but does not alter body fat								JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE				90	13			4876	4882		10.2527/jas.2011-4976			DEC 2012	2012	Studies using dietary supplementation of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic fatty acids (FA) in horses report inconsistent anti-inflammatory results but consistently report an increase in plasma arachidonic acid (C20:4), the major substrate of cyclooxygenase (COX) II inflammatory pathway. Conjugated linoleic acid has shown anti-inflammatory effects in laboratory and food animal species, but effects of CLA supplementation in horses have not been reported. Our objective was to determine the effects of CLA supplementation on plasma CLA and C20: 4 and body fat in healthy horses at maintenance. In a crossover study, 12 mature mares were blocked by breed, age, and BCS and separated into 2 treatment groups (n = 6/group). Groups were fed CLA and corn oil (CO; isocaloric control) for two 6-wk feeding periods, separated by a 4-wk period during which treatment was withheld. Corn oil or CLA supplement (55% mixed CLA isomers) was incorporated into diets at 0.01% BW/d. Mares were fed individually and restricted to dry lots to control forage intake. Rump fat thickness (RFT), BW, and BCS were measured before (d 0) and after (d 42) each feeding period. Blood was collected on d 0, 14, 28, and 42 of each 6-wk period for GLC analysis of plasma CLA isomers (cis-9, trans-11; trans-10, cis-12; and trans-9, trans-11) and C20:4. An ANOVA was conducted to compare the response of RFT, BW, and BCS of CLA-treated and control mares. A mixed methods analysis with repeated measures was used to detect differences in plasma FA concentrations. There were no differences in BW, RFT, or BCS between treatment groups. All CLA isomers present in the CLA supplement were greater in plasma of horses fed CLA compared with controls (P < 0.01). Additionally, plasma concentrations of C20: 4 were decreased in horses fed CLA (P < 0.05). This decline in C20: 4 may impact the COX II pathway and warrants further investigation. These results suggest that in an equine model, dietary CLA increases circulating concentrations of supplemented CLA isomers and decreases circulating C20: 4. Examining physiological effects of CLA supplementation in horses at varying levels of growth, exercise, and progression of joint disease may offer insight to potential benefits of CLA in the horse.									1	0	0	1	1	2			0021-8812	1525-3163		WOS:000319668000023	22829604

Age, Growth, and Reproductive Biology of Three Catostomids From the Apalachicola River, Florida								JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT				3	2			223	237		10.3996/012012-JFWM-008			DEC 2012	2012	Riverine catostomids can show a wide range of interspecific variation in life-history characteristics. Understanding these differences is an important consideration in evaluating the sensitivity of these fishes to disturbance and in formulating effective conservation strategies, particularly when dealing with an assemblage consisting of multiple species within a watershed. We collected Apalachicola redhorse Moxostoma n. sp. cf. poecilurum (n = 125), spotted sucker Minytrema melanops (n = 94), and quillback Carpiodes cyprinus (n = 94) to determine age, growth, and reproductive biology of spawning catostomids in the Apalachicola River, Florida, during 2007. Quillback was the smallest in total length at age; longest-lived; most fecund; and produced the smallest eggs. Apalachicola redhorse was the largest in body size; had an intermediate life span; and produced the fewest yet largest eggs. Spotted sucker was more similar to Apalachicola redhorse in most characteristics. Growth during ages 1-3 in all three species seemed to be negatively related to the proportion of observations of extreme flow, both high (Q(90)) and low (Q(10)), per year and a positive response in growth rate to high flows (>Q(75) but < Q(90)). However, Apalachicola redhorse and spotted sucker growth was more sensitive to flow conditions than that of quillback. Our results suggest the life histories and ecological response of Apalachicola River catostomids to flow regulation are important components for developing strategies that incorporate the needs of these fishery resources into an ecosystem-based management approach.									4	0	0	4	0	4			1944-687X			WOS:000314539400004

Effects of the green tea catechin (-)-epigallocatechin gallate on Trypanosoma brucei								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY-DRUGS AND DRUG RESISTANCE				2				225	229		10.1016/j.ijpddr.2012.09.001			DEC 2012	2012	The current pharmacopeia to treat the lethal human and animal diseases caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei remains limited. The parasite's ability to undergo antigenic variation represents a considerable barrier to vaccine development, making the identification of new drug targets extremely important. Recent studies have demonstrated that fatty acid synthesis is important for growth and virulence of Trypanosoma brucei brucei, suggesting this pathway may have therapeutic potential. The first committed step of fatty acid synthesis is catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), which is a known target of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), an active polyphenol compound found in green tea. EGCG exerts its effects on ACC through activation of AMP-dependent protein kinase, which phosphorylates and inhibits ACC. We found that EGCG inhibited TbACC activity with an EC50 of 37 mu M and 55 mu M for bloodstream form and procyclic form lysates, respectively. Treatment with 100 mu M EGCG induced a 4.7- and 1.7- fold increase in TbACC phosphorylation in bloodstream form and procyclic lysates. EGCG also inhibited the growth of bloodstream and procyclic parasites in culture, with a 48 h EC50 of 33 mu M and 27 mu M, respectively, which is greater than the EGCG plasma levels typically achievable in humans through oral dosing. Daily intraperitoneal administration of EGCG did not reduce the virulence of an acute mouse model of T. b. brucei infection. These data suggest a reduced potential for EGCG to treat T. brucei infections, but suggest that EGCG may prove to be useful as a tool to probe ACC regulation.

Using the CHARMM force field, adsorption free energies were found to be overestimated (i.e., too strongly adsorbing) by about 5-9 kcal/mol compared to the experimental data for both types of silica surfaces. Peptide adsorption behavior for the silica glass surface was then adjusted using a modified version of the CHARMM program, which we call dual force-field CHARMM, which allows separate sets of nonbonded parameters (i.e., partial charge and Lennard-Jones parameters) to be used to represent intra-phase and inter-phase interactions within a given molecular system. Using this program, interfacial force field (IFF) parameters for the peptide-silica glass systems were corrected to obtain adsorption free energies within about 0.5 kcal/mol of their respective experimental values, while IFF tuning for the quartz (100) surface remains for future work. The tuned IFF parameter set for silica glass will subsequently be used for simulations of protein adsorption behavior on silica glass with greater confidence in the balance between relative adsorption affinities of amino acid residues and the aqueous solution for the silica glass surface.									4	0	0	3	0	4			1934-8630	1559-4106		WOS:000316398000008	22941539	
J	Sun, Youping; White, Sarah A.; Mann, David; Adelberg, Jeffrey								Chilling Requirements to Break Dormancy of Veratrum californicum								HORTSCIENCE				47	12			1710	1713					DEC 2012	2012	Veratrum californicum, a native of the western United States, has long been used in herbal medicine and now also has potential pharmaceutical uses. As a result of a projected increasing demand for V. californicum biomass for pharmaceutical purposes, the development of a chilling protocol for enhanced cultivation efficiency is needed. To study the effects of chilling on the growth of V. californicum, field-collected rhizomes with attached bulbs and roots were potted, stored at 10 degrees C for 2 weeks, and subsequently chilled at 5 degrees C for 30 to 180 days before transfer to a greenhouse or growth room. Twenty plants were transferred to the greenhouse every 30 days to observe growth. Ten plants were harvested at shoot emergence and the remaining 10 when leaves were fully expanded. In addition, 10 plants were transferred from 5 degrees C to a growth room every 30 days where net photosynthetic rates were measured. Longer chilling duration correlated with a reduction in days to shoot emergence and leaf expansion. The net photosynthetic rates of V. californicum plants chilled for 120, 150, or 180 days were higher than those of plants chilled for only 30, 60, or 90 days. Plants exposed to longer chilling durations were taller and had larger, more numerous leaves. Interestingly, V. californicum shoot emergence was also observed in the dark at 5 degrees C after the bulbs had been stored for 210 days. Growth of the root systems of plants was also observed during chilling. In conclusion, chilling was necessary at 5 degrees C for a minimum of 120 days to force early emergence and vigorous growth of V. californicum.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0018-5345			WOS:000315708400008

J	Xiao, Feipeng; Amirkhanian, Serji N.; Juang, C. Hsein; Hu, Shaowei; Shen, Junan								Model developments of long-term aged asphalt binders								CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS				37				248	256		10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2012.07.047			DEC 2012	2012	Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are useful in place of conventional physical models for analyzing complex relationship involving multiple variables and have been successfully used in civil engineering applications. The objective of this study was to develop a series of ANN models to simulate the long-term aging of three asphalt binders (PG 64-22, crumb rubberized asphalt modifier, PG 76-22) regarding seven aging variables such as aging temperature and duration, m-value, mass loss of pressurized aging vessel (PAV) samples, percentages of large and small molecular sizes of high pressure-gel permeation chromatographic (GPC) testing, and binder stiffness. The results indicated that ANN-based models are more effective than the regression models and can easily be implemented in a spreadsheet, thus making it easy to apply. The results also show that the aging temperature, aging duration, percentage of large and small molecular sizes, and binder stiffness are the most important factors in the developed ANN models for prediction of penetration index after a long-term aging process.

J	Agrawal, A.; Ziegert, J.; Smith, S.; Woody, B.; Cao, J.				Cao, Jian/B-7544-2009				Study of Dimensional Repeatability and Fatigue Life for Deformation Machining Bending Mode								JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME				134	6					061009	10.1115/1.4007716			DEC 2012	2012	Deformation machining (DM) is a hybrid process which combines two emerging manufacturing processes, machining of thin structures and single-point incremental forming (SPIF). This hybrid process enables the creation of structures that have geometries that would be difficult or impossible to create using any either process alone. A comprehensive study of DM bending mode components has been carried out in this paper by studying their dimensional repeatability and fatigue life and comparing these with similar components fabricated with sheet metal. Experimental studies have been performed for part features created by the DM "bending mode" process, in which a thin vertical wall is machined on the part, and then incrementally bent with a single-point forming tool. The dimensional repeatability of DM components is compared with sheet metal components made by single-point incremental forming and conventional bending in a press brake [Agrawal et al., 2010, "Comparison of Dimensional Repeatability of Deformation Machined Components With Sheet Metal Components," North American Manufacturing Research Conference, NAMRC 38, Transactions of NAMRI/SME, Vol. 38, pp. 571-576]. The results of this study indicate that the DM process is not capable of holding tolerances as tight as a standard milling process. This may be due to local variations in material properties that influence the yield strength and resulting springback. However, thin components created by DM are more repeatable than similar components created from sheet metal using SPIF, but less repeatable than components created by conventional bending of sheet metal. The second objective of the present work is to investigate whether components fabricated using the DM process can be considered for fatigue critical applications [Megahed et al., 1996, "Low-Cycle Fatigue in Rotating Cantilever Under Bending I: Theoretical Analysis," Int. J. Fatigue, 18(6), pp. 401-412; Khalid et al., 2007, "Bending Fatigue Behavior of Hybrid Aluminum/Composite Drive Shafts," Mater. Des., 28, pp. 329-334]. Studies were performed to experimentally compare the fatigue life of components fabricated by DM process with sheet metal components made by single-point incremental forming and conventional bending. Results of the study indicate that sheet metal SPIF components under the present loading conditions have significantly longer fatigue life of approximately 3900-5500 cycles, compared to DM and sheet metal conventionally bent components with approximately equal fatigue life of 2200-3900 cycles.

J	Keinath, Anthony P.; DuBose, Virginia B.								Controlling powdery mildew on cucurbit rootstock seedlings in the greenhouse with fungicides and biofungicides								CROP PROTECTION				42				338	344		10.1016/j.cropro.2012.06.009			DEC 2012	2012	Powdery mildew (Podosphaera xanthii) affects seedlings of inter-specific hybrid squash (Cucurbita moschata x Cucurbita maxima) and bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria) used as rootstocks to graft seedless watermelon (Citrullus lanatus var. lanatus). Because powdery mildew grows primarily on the leaf surface where contact fungicides are effective, biofungicides may be effective preventative treatments for powdery mildew. The objectives of this study were to determine which biofungicides, organic fungicides, and conventional synthetic fungicides provided the best control of powdery mildew and least phytotoxicity on cucurbit rootstock seedlings in the greenhouse. Sixteen treatments (six biopesticides, four additional organic-approved fungicides, and six conventional synthetic fungicides) were tested. Four experiments were conducted and all were repeated once. Hybrid squash 'Strong Tosa' seedlings were used in the first three experiments, and bottle gourd 'Emphasis' seedlings were used in experiment four. In experiments one, two, and four, seedlings were sprayed three times at 5-day intervals and exposed to powdery mildew continuously after the first application. In the third experiment, seedlings were exposed to inoculum for 7 days, sprayed once, and held in a humidity chamber for 7 days under conditions used for healing after grafting. The most effective organic-approved fungicides were sulfur and fish oil + sesame oil, and the most effective conventional fungicides were penthiopyrad, myclobutanil, and cyprodinil plus fludioxonil. Quinoxyfen was phytotoxic to cotyledons of both species, and tebuconazole stunted both species. To manage powdery mildew, one or two preventative applications of sulfur or fish oil + sesame oil and one application of myclobutanil or penthiopyrad, if needed, are recommended.

J	Taydas, Zeynep; Akbaba, Yasemin; Morrison, Minion K. C.								Did Secularism Fail? The Rise of Religion in Turkish Politics								POLITICS AND RELIGION				5	3			528	554		10.1017/S1755048312000296			DEC 2012	2012	Religious movements have long been challenging the modernist and secularist ideas around the world. Within the last decade or so, pro-religious parties made significant electoral advances in various countries, including India, Sudan, Algeria, and the Palestinian territories. In this article, we focus on the rise of the pro-religious Justice and Development Party (Adalet ve Kalkinma Partisi-AKP) to power in the 2002 elections in Turkey. Using the Turkish experience with political Islam, we evaluate the explanatory value of Mark Juergensmeyer's rise of religious nationalism theory, with a special emphasis on the "failed secularism" argument. Our analysis indicates that the theoretical approach formulated by Juergensmeyer has a great deal of explanatory power; however, it does not provide a complete explanation for the success of the AKP. The rise of religion in Turkish politics is the result of a complex process over long years of encounter and confrontation between two frameworks of order, starting with the sudden imposition of secularism from above, when the republic was established. Hence, to understand the rise of religion in contemporary Turkish politics, an in-depth understanding of history, politics, and the sources of tension between secularists and Islamists is essential. The findings of this article have important implications for other countries, especially those that are experiencing a resurgence of religion in politics, and are struggling to integrate religious parties into a democratic system.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1755-0483	1755-0491		WOS:000314462900002

Development of a Plant-Based Threshold for Tarnished Plant Bug (Hemiptera: Miridae) in Cotton								JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY				105	6			2007	2014		10.1603/EC12079			DEC 2012	2012	The tarnished plant bug, Lygus lineolaris (Palisot de Beauvois), is an important pest of cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L., in the mid-southern United States. It is exclusively controlled with foliar insecticide applications, and sampling methods and thresholds need to be revisited. The current experiment was designed to establish a plant-based threshold during the flowering period of cotton development. Experiments were conducted in Mississippi in 2005 and 2006, Arkansas in 2005, and Louisiana in 2005 through 2008. Treatments consisted of various combinations of thresholds based on the percentage of dirty squares that were compared with the current threshold with a drop cloth or automatic weekly applications. Dirty squares were characterized as those with yellow staining on the developing bud resulting from tarnished plant bug excrement. Treatments consisted of 5, 10, 20, and 30% dirty squares. Each plot was sampled weekly, and insecticides were applied when the mean of all replications of a particular treatment reached the designated threshold. At the end of the season, plots were harvested and lint yields were recorded. Differences were observed in the number of applications and yields among the different treatments. The 10% dirty squares threshold resulted in a similar economic return compared with the drop cloth. A threshold of 10% dirty squares resulted in a similar number of insecticide applications, yields, and economic returns compared with that observed with the drop cloth. These results suggest that a threshold of 10% dirty squares could be used to trigger insecticide applications targeting tarnished plant bugs in flowering cotton.									5	0	0	5	0	5			0022-0493			WOS:000312445600018	23356065

Proper choice of solvent, silicic acid precursor, catalyst, and microwave irradiation time were the variables used to control nanoparticle size and, ultimately, overcome the previously reported shortcomings of using microwaves for silica nanoparticle synthesis. In these reactions acetone, a low-tan delta solvent, mediates the condensation reaction, while selective absorption of pulsed microwave radiation by the precursor promotes nanoparticle growth. Dynamic light scattering data, scanning electron micrographs, and transmission electron micrographs of the reaction products show that the size, shape, and granularity of the silica nanoparticles are highly dependent on reaction conditions. These microwave methods have utility for mass production of silica nanoparticles or other nanoparticles by flow through microwave synthetic methods for industrial applications, as well as a facile method for encapsulating or embedding materials with silica for improved functionality and stability.									14	1	0	1	0	14			1944-8244			WOS:000313149800063	23182127

Pinocembrin exhibited strong antifungal activity against P. italicum in a dose-dependent manner. Respiration rates of P. italicum during spore germination and mycelial growth were significantly inhibited when exposure to pinocembrin. The respirations of mitochondria in state 2 and state 3 from mycelia were significantly inhibited in the presence of this compound. The phosphorylated adenosine nucleotides levels in hyphae of P. italicum treated with pinocembrin were significantly low and energy charge value became unstable. Unltrastructure of hyphae was seriously damaged with pinocembrin incubation for 24 h, which was further confirmed by the increase of relative ionic leakage and soluble protein loss of P. italicum mycelia treated with pinocembrin. It was concluded that pinocembrin inhibited the mycelial growth of P. italicum by interfering energy homeostasis and cell membrane damage of the pathogen. Pinocembrin would be a promising bioactive compound for treatment of P. italicum infections on postharvest citrus fruit.									6	1	0	4	0	7			1226-7708			WOS:000313078600004

Magnetic field-induced particle separation is simple, cheap, and free of fluid heating issues that accompany electric, acoustic, and optical methods. We develop herein a novel microfluidic approach to continuous sheath-free magnetic separation of particles. This approach exploits the negative or positive magnetophoretic deflection to focus and separate particles in the two branches of a U-shaped microchannel, respectively. It is applicable to both magnetic and diamagnetic particle separations, and is demonstrated through the sorting of 5 mu m and 15 mu m polystyrene particles suspended in a dilute ferrofluid.

Spatial Analysis of the Cereal Leaf Beetle (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) in Wheat								ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY				41	6			1516	1526		10.1603/EN12103			DEC 2012	2012	A 2-yr study was conducted in wheat, Triticum aestivum L., in South Carolina involving weekly sampling of cereal leaf beetle, Oulema melanopus (L.). According to the Spatial Analysis by Distance IndicEs (SADIE) aggregation index, adults (80% of sampling date-field combinations) were more frequently aggregated than eggs (26%) and larvae (57%). Spatial and temporal stability, as indicated by positive association indices among sampling dates, was significant in 27, 30, 33 and 31% of analyses for adults in fields A, B, C, and D, respectively. Peak densities of adults were also spatially associated with peak densities of eggs and larvae in all fields, except for larvae in fields C and D. Spike numbers were greater in interior portions of the field compared with field edges. All stages of O. melanopus were positively associated with spike counts on at least one sampling date, generally corresponding to peak densities of each life stage. This study provides insight into the importance of wheat stand as a potential major factor influencing the spatial distribution of O. melanopus. Determining when and where O. melanopus accumulate in wheat fields in the southeastern United States can provide useful information that could lead to improved sampling plans and more efficient use of insecticides.									7	0	0	7	0	7			0046-225X			WOS:000312670000026	23321100

Indirect tensile strength (ITS), tensile strength ratio (TSR), deformation, and toughness were tested to determine the moisture sensitivity of these mixtures. The experimental design included aggregate moisture content (similar to 0.5% by weight of dry mass of the aggregate), two aggregate sources (B and C), two hydrated lime contents (1% and 2% by weight of aggregate), three WMA additives (Asphamin, Sasobit, and Evotherm) along with control mixture, and four different types of binders [i.e., PG 64-22 + 10% crumb rubber (CR) (minus #40 mesh), PG 64-22 + 15% CR, PG 64-22 + 20% CR, and PG 76-22 + fibers] were used in this study. A total of 256 samples were utilized for the ITS testing. In general, except for the mixture with 10% CR using Evotherm, all other mixtures containing WMA additives met the minimum wet ITS requirement of 448 kPa as per South Carolina DOT (SCDOT) specifications. Test results indicated that 24 mixtures failed to meet the minimum TSR requirement of 85%. Test results showed that by increasing the lime content to 2%, a majority of the mixtures containing WMA showed improvement in the TSR values. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE) MT.1943-5533.0000525.

Mater. 32 (2010) 862-867] was the crystallographic orientation of the core phase in a semiconductor optical fiber relative to the fiber axes. In this continuation, the same glass-clad crystalline germanium core optical fibers were tapered and, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, the influence of tapering on the core crystallography is studied and reported. Single crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) shows that the act of tapering not only modifies the fiber dimension but also re-orients the crystallography of the crystalline core. This can be especially useful to the continued optimization of these crystalline semiconductor core optical fibers and such control over crystal orientation is critical for future fiber-based nonlinear and optoelectronic devices.

We propose an explanation for regulatory persistence based on regulatory fog, the phenomenon by which regulation obscures information regarding the value of counterfactual policies. We construct a dynamic model of regulation in which the underlying need for regulation varies stochastically, and regulation undermines the social planner's ability to observe the state of the world. Compared to a full-information benchmark, regulation is highly persistent, often lasting indefinitely. Regulatory fog is robust to a broad range of partially informative policies and can be quite detrimental to social welfare. Regulatory experiments, modeled as costly and imperfect signals of the underlying state, do not eliminate the effects of regulatory fog. We characterize their effects and provide a framework for choosing amongst a set of potential regulatory experiments. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This is one of the most comprehensive data sets on GRB afterglow observations of short bursts published so far. In three cases, GROND was on target within less than 10 min after the trigger, leading to the discovery of the afterglow of GRB 081226A and its faint underlying host galaxy. In addition, GROND was able to image the optical afterglow and follow the light curve evolution in five further cases: GRBs 090305, 090426, 090510, 090927, and 100117A. In all other cases, optical/near-infrared upper limits can be provided on the afterglow magnitudes. After shifting all light curves to a common redshift, we find that the optical luminosities of the six events with light curves group into two subsamples. GRBs 090426 and 090927 are situated in the regime occupied by long-duration events (collapsars), while the other four bursts occupy the parameter space typical for merger events, confirming that the short-burst population is contaminated by collapsar events. Three of the aforementioned six bursts with optical light curves show a break: GRBs 090426 and 090510 (Papers I and II) as well as GRB 090305. For GRB 090927, no break is seen in the optical/X-ray light curve until about 150 ks/600 ks after the burst. The GROND multi-color data support the view that this burst is related to a collapsar event. A decay slope of the optical afterglow of GRB 100117A could be measured. For all six GRBs a lower limit on the corresponding jet opening angle can be set. Using these data supplemented by about ten events taken from the literature, we compare the jet half-opening angles of long and short bursts. We find tentative evidence that short bursts have wider opening angles than long bursts. However, the statistics are still very poor.									17	0	0	0	0	17			0004-6361			WOS:000311901200101

The structure, energetics, and lattice thermal conductance of certain low energy grain boundaries were studied. Atomic models of these boundaries were relaxed using density functional theory. Information about bonding across the interfaces was determined from the electron localization function. Interfacial thermal conductances were computed using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics. Microstructural models were used to determine the reduction in lattice thermal conductivity due grain boundary networks where FEM meshes were constructed on top of microstructural images.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0002-7820			WOS:000312145600045

To this end, we synthesized ZnO nanotetrapods using a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process, annealed at temperatures below 200 degrees C in O-2, Ar, and Zn metal vapor and measured the ensuing optical properties. Our z-scan measurements show that all samples exhibit an effective three-photon absorption (3PA). Furthermore, the 3PA coefficient varies with the incident laser intensity consistent with the presence of real mid-gap states. Interestingly, the rate of change for the 3PA coefficient is strongly influenced by the annealing conditions. Annealing in Zn vapor (Ar and O-2) leads to an increase (decrease) in green luminescence and the 3PA coefficient, strongly suggesting that the Zn interstitials are involved in the mechanism of green luminescence.									8	0	0	0	0	8			2158-5849			WOS:000312111500011

In Escherichia coli (E. coli), three differently regulated DAHP synthases carry out the first regulated step in the aromatic amino acid biosynthetic pathway. The three DAHP synthases encoded by the genes aroG, aroF and aroH are inhibited by phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan, respectively. In this work, the aroG gene was cloned and mutated by site-directed mutagenesis using splicing overlap extension PCR (SOE-PCR) technique. The feedback-resistant DAHP synthase encoded by aroG was achieved by replacing the residue Leu175 of aroG with Asp as to increase net carbon flow down the common pathway. SOS-PAGE which was used to access the protein expression level of aroGM showed the strain harbored mutated aroGM gene achieve over-expression compared to strain contain empty plasmid pET-28b (+).

There are many explanations for the underrepresentation such as poor advocacy for TR services, lack of specification in educational policy, and unresolved philosophical differences in the profession. This article provides an overview of the TR profession, the policies that enable the use of TR services, and how TR services can contribute to the educational outcomes of students with disabilities. Recommendations for improving the representation of TR services within special education services are also discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1044-2073			WOS:000312370100001

Why consumers respond differently to absolute versus percentage descriptions of quantities								MARKETING LETTERS				23	4			943	957		10.1007/s11002-012-9189-y			DEC 2012	2012	Consumers often provide different evaluations of absolute and percentage descriptions of the same quantity. Prior research has attributed this to two factors: selection of distinct reference contexts and differential cognitive difficulty. However, in a preliminary study, we show that discrepancies in consumer evaluations of absolute and percentage quantities can arise even when these two factors are held constant. A series of studies provides evidence that (1) this effect is rooted in automatic, nonverbal associations between numerical stimuli and analogue magnitude coding and (2) the influence of analogue magnitude codes manifests across different kinds of quantities, different evaluations, and different processing modes.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0923-0645			WOS:000312069100003

A total of 4355 female mosquitoes of 14 species were collected, of which 106 individuals of nine species were blood-fed. The most common taxa were Aedes albopictus (Skuse), Aedes triseriatus (Say), Anopheles punctipennis (Say), Culex erraticus (Dyar & Knab), Culex pipiens complex (L.) and Culex restuans (Theobald). Molecular analyses (cytochrome b) of bloodmeals revealed that mosquitoes fed on captive animals, humans and wildlife, and took mixed bloodmeals. Host species included one amphibian, 16 birds, 10 mammals (including humans) and two reptiles. Minimum dispersal distances after feeding on captive hosts ranged from 15.5 m to 327.0 m. Mosquitohost associations generally conformed to previous accounts, indicating that mosquito behaviour inside zoos reflects that outside zoos. However, novel variation in host use, including new, exotic host records, warrants further investigation. Zoos, thus, can be used as experiment environments in which to study mosquito behaviour, and the findings extrapolated to non-zoo areas, while providing medical and veterinary benefits to zoo animals, employees and patrons.									5	0	0	5	0	6			0269-283X			WOS:000312081800006	22390304

We prepared high-quality As2Se3 glass films using spin coating from ethylenediamine solutions. The physio-chemical properties of the films are characterized as a function of annealing conditions. Compared to bulk glasses, as-deposited films possess a distinctively different network structure due to presence of Se-Se homopolar bonds and residual solvent. Annealing partially recovers the As-Se-3 pyramid structure and brings the film refractive indices close to the bulk value. Optical loss in the films measured at 1550 nm wavelength is 9 dB/cm, which was attributed to N-H bond absorption from residual solvent.

Investigation of avian influenza viral ribonucleic acid destruction in poultry co-products under rendering conditions								JOURNAL OF APPLIED POULTRY RESEARCH				21	4			719	725		10.3382/japr.2011-00345			DEC 2012	2012	This study was conducted to determine the time and temperature requirements needed to destroy avian influenza viral RNA in high-fat poultry tissues and to determine whether those conditions are met by rendering cooking processes. Because rendered poultry products are used worldwide for feed ingredients, it is imperative to validate the destruction of avian influenza viral RNA to ensure the safety of rendering co-products and avoid cyclic reinfection and disease in poultry, livestock, and potentially humans. Typical high-fat poultry offal was spiked with a known quantity of chemically inactivated, intact H5N9 low-pathogenicity avian influenza viral RNA. After subjecting the material to a variety of thermal doses, RNA was extracted from the material and assayed for the presence of the virus by using real-time reverse-transcription PCR. With thermal treatment at 100 degrees C for 30 s or longer or at 110 degrees C and above for 15 s or longer, the RNA of low-pathogenicity avian influenza virus A/Turkey/Wisconsin/68 H5N9, equivalent to 6 log(10) of viable virus, was destroyed within the poultry rendering materials. These thermal treatment conditions are well below the range of temperatures and times used for rendering poultry carcasses and offal in the United States and Canada, where rendered materials are subjected to a heat treatment for a minimum of 30 min with a cooker exit temperature of not less than 118 degrees C.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1056-6171			WOS:000311806000001		
J	Thompson, Ronald H.; Joseph, Paul; Delfino, Antonio; Meraldi, Jean-Paul								Critical compressive stress for continuous fiber unidirectional composites								JOURNAL OF COMPOSITE MATERIALS				46	26			3231	3245		10.1177/0021998312437231			DEC 2012	2012	Dow and Rosen's work in 1965 formed an intellectual framework for compressive strength of unidirectional composites. Compressive strength was explained in terms of micro-buckling, in which filaments are beams on an elastic foundation. While groundbreaking, the discrepancy between model predictions and observed compressive strength is well known. This study builds on Dow and Rosen's model specifically with respect to the dominant shear mode instability. A new method that accounts for matrix thermal residual strain, matrix compressive and shear stresses, with associated reductions in tangent modulus due to matrix non-linearity, is proposed. The method is validated using a specific test case, which is conducted to precisely account for microscopic fiber alignment and matrix non-linearity. Accordingly, a method of measuring and accounting for a continuum of fiber misalignment is developed. Predictions are compared to literature values, with variations in fiber modulus, matrix modulus, and volume fraction. Good agreement is shown, both in terms of trend and magnitude. The approach successfully preserves initial in-plane shear stiffness, while showing that in-plane shear stiffness decreases significantly as compressive stress increases.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0021-9983			WOS:000311852600002

A Christian Faith-Based Recovery Theory: Understanding God as Sponsor								JOURNAL OF RELIGION & HEALTH				51	4			1152	1164		10.1007/s10943-010-9422-z			DEC 2012	2012	This article reports the development of a substantive theory to explain an evangelical Christian-based process of recovery from addiction. Faith-based, 12-step, mutual aid programs can improve drug abstinence by offering: (a) an intervention option alone and/or in conjunction with secular programs and (b) an opportunity for religious involvement. Although literature on religion, spirituality, and addiction is voluminous, traditional 12-step programs fail to explain the mechanism that underpins the process of Christian-based recovery (CR). This pilot study used grounded theory to explore and describe the essence of recovery of 10 former crack cocaine-addicted persons voluntarily enrolled in a CR program. Data were collected from in-depth interviews during 4 months of 2008. Audiotapes were transcribed verbatim, and the constant comparative method was used to analyze data resulting in the basic social process theory, understanding God as sponsor. The theory was determined through writing theoretical memos that generated key elements that allow persons to recover: acknowledging God-centered crises, communicating with God, and planning for the future. Findings from this preliminary study identifies important factors that can help persons in recovery to sustain sobriety and program administrators to benefit from theory that guides the development of evidence-based addiction interventions.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0022-4197			WOS:000311313500012	21046250

Development and evaluation of methods to assess populations of black flies (Diptera: Simuliidae) at nests of the endangered whooping crane (Grus americana)								JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY				37	2			298	306		10.1111/j.1948-7134.2012.00231.x			DEC 2012	2012	Hematophagous insects can negatively affect the reproductive success of their vertebrate hosts. To determine the influence of hematophagous insects on endangered vertebrates requires specially designed programs that minimize disturbance to the hosts and address problems associated with their small populations. We developed and evaluated a surveillance program for black flies potentially affecting a population of whooping cranes (Grus americana) introduced to central Wisconsin, U.S.A. In one of the few studies to survey host-seeking female black flies and their immature stages concurrently, we processed nearly 346,000 specimens and documented 26 species, of which only two, Simulium annulus and Simulium johannseni, were attracted to nesting whooping cranes. Attempts to assess black fly populations with artificial nests and real crane eggs were unsuccessful. Carbon-dioxide traps performed well in describing black fly taxa on the landscape. However, the number of black flies at whooping crane nests was consistently higher than the number captured in carbon-dioxide traps. The carbon-dioxide traps poorly described the presence/absence, population fluctuations, and periodicity of black flies at whooping crane nests. The weak performance of the carbon-dioxide traps might have resulted from microhabitat differences between trap locations and nests or from Simulium annulus and Simulium johannseni using sensory cues in addition to carbon dioxide to find hosts. Choice of trapping techniques, therefore, depends on the information required for the particular study objectives.									4	0	0	3	0	4			1081-1710			WOS:000311604600007	23181852

DNA sequences from the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of this nematode were used to design primers for conventional and real-time PCR, as well as a TaqMan probe. These primers amplified DNA of reniform nematode isolates from a wide geographic range but did not detect genetically related species or other pathogenic nematodes found in production fields including Meloidogyne incognita and Heterodera glycines. Both SYBR green and TaqMan assays reliably quantified as little as 100 fg of reniform nematode DNA, and could be used to quantify as few as five reniform nematodes. An inexpensive and rapid DNA extraction protocol for high throughput diagnostic assays is described.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0191-2917	1943-7692		WOS:000311462700006		
J	Saylor, John. R.; Bounds, Garrett D.								Experimental study of the role of the Weber and capillary numbers on Mesler entrainment								AICHE JOURNAL				58	12			3841	3851		10.1002/aic.13764			DEC 2012	2012	Mesler entrainment is the formation of a very large number of very small bubbles by a relatively low velocity drop impacting a liquid surface. The role of the Weber number in Mesler entrainment has received significant attention. However, the effect of the capillary number, which quantifies the relative importance of viscous and surface tension forces, has not been explored. This is due primarily to the fact that virtually all Mesler entrainment research has used a single liquid, water, as the working fluid. This, combined with certain experimental restrictions, makes difficult an independent variation of the Weber and capillary numbers. To address this problem, Mesler entrainment was investigated using two silicone oils, having kinematic viscosities of 0.65 cSt and 10.0 cSt, respectively, revealing the effect of the capillary number on Mesler entrainment, a result which has not been obtained heretofore. The silicone oils give extremely repeatable results when compared to water. (C) 2012 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2012									11	0	0	1	0	11			0001-1541			WOS:000310871400023

Evaluating programs targeting physical activity may help to reduce disparate rates of obesity among African Americans. We report formative process evaluation methods and implementation dose, fidelity, and reach in the Positive Action for Today's Health trial.Methods: We applied evaluation methods based on an ecological framework in 2 community-based police-patrolled walking programs targeting access and safety in underserved African American communities. One program also targeted social connectedness and motivation to walk using a social marketing approach. Process data were systematically collected from baseline to 12 months.Results: Adequate implementation dose was achieved, with fidelity achieved but less stable in both programs. Monthly walkers increased to 424 in the walking-plus-social marketing program, indicating expanding program reach, in contrast to no increase in the walking-only program. Increased reach was correlated with peer-led Pride Strides (r=.92; P<.001), a key social marketing component, and program social interaction was the primary reason for which walkers reported participating.Conclusions: Formative process evaluation demonstrated that the walking programs were effectively implemented and that social marketing increased walking and perceived social connectedness in African American communities.

Simple in vitro comparisons are not definitive since fluorophore brightness in vitro may not correspond with intracellular brightness. We have compared the fluorescence brightness of J774A.1 cells loaded with 24 nm methoxy-capped 2,000 M (r) polyethylene glycol lipid PFBT nanoparticles (PEG lipid-PFBT CPNs) to cells loaded with carboxy-functionalized quantum dots (Qdots) or a dextran-linked small molecule organic dye, Alexa Fluor 488 dextran (AF488-dex). Under conditions likely to be used for biological imaging or flow cytometry, these CPNs are 175x brighter than Qdots and 1,400x brighter than AF488-dex in cells. Evaluation of the minimum incubation concentration required for detection of nanoparticle fluorescence with a commercial flow cytometer indicated that the limit of detection for PEG lipid-PFBT CPNs was 19 pM (86 ppb), substantially lower than values obtained for Qdots (980 pM) or AF488-dex (11.2 nM). Investigation of the mechanism of cellular uptake of the three fluid-phase labels indicates that these particles are passively taken into macrophage cells via macropinocytosis without interaction with cell surface receptors, and ultimately localize in lysosomes. In addition, no cytotoxicity could be observed at any of the CPN concentrations tested. Together, these data suggest that these CPNs are appropriate and attractive candidates as fluid-phase markers with significantly greater fluorescence brightness than existing dyes or nanoparticles. We expect that these CPNs will find application in both imaging and flow cytometry.									3	0	0	2	0	3			1618-2642			WOS:000311310100023	23052882

Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that lithium induces apoptotic cell death in HL-60 promyelocytes at concentrations of 10 mM and above. A lithium-tolerant HL-60 sub-clone, resistant to up to 15 mM lithium, was also generated and its growth profile reported. Treatment of cells with lithium resulted in a dose-dependent induction of p53, retinoblastoma (Rb) and bax expression which was accompanied by concomitant inhibition of bcl-2 expression as demonstrated using immunohistochemical microscopy. These results seem to suggest that lithium induced cell death in these cells by inhibiting expression of anti-apoptotic protein, bcl-2, while inducing higher expression of its pro-apoptotic counterparts which include bax. Expression of bax and bcl-2 is also linked to expression of inflammation-regulating cytokines. Using ELISA assays, lithium was demonstrated to induce production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-alpha, while inhibiting release of anti-inflammation-related IL-2 and IL-10 in a dose-dependent fashion. Our findings identify a critical function for lithium in modulating pro- versus anti-apoptotic gene expression and pro- versus anti-inflammatory cytokines in vitro and provide a rationale for suggesting a promising role of lithium in regulation of inflammation and cancer growth.									8	0	0	5	0	8			0163-4984			WOS:000311310800004	22576985

In the present study, metallothionein and fixed wavelength bile fluorescence for two-, four-, and five-ring hydrocarbons were used as biomarkers of exposure in largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) in the Reedy River watershed located in South Carolina, USA. Fish were sampled from three impoundments and a reference site over three seasons in the same year. Biomarker endpoints were compared to chemical concentrations at each site during each season. Results indicated that despite elevated concentrations of hydrocarbons being present in sediments, the hydrocarbons did not appear to be bioavailable based on bile fluorescence analysis. Bile fluorescence analysis also indicated that the hydrocarbons detected in this watershed were likely of petrogenic origin. Significantly elevated sediment concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Ni, Ag, Zn, and metallothionein were found in one impoundment, Lake Conestee, compared with the reference site, indicating both the presence and bioavailability of these metals. Seasonal variability of bile fluorescence was limited; however, metallothionein showed elevated concentrations in the spring and summer compared with fall. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2012; 31: 27632770.

One-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) tests and Box-Behnken design (BBD) of response surface methodology (RSM) were used to investigate the effect of pulsed electric field (PEF) treatment parameters on antioxidant activity of polypeptides. The optimal conditions were as follows: concentration 8 mg/mL, electric field intensity 10 kV/cm, and pulse frequency 2000 Hz, under which, the FRAP value increased 44.23%, compared to the antioxidant activity of the polypeptides without PEF treatment. Both near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) and mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR) were used to analyze the change of functional groups. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Long, N. M.; Collier, R. J.; Smith, J. F.								Short communication: Comparison of 2 methods of assessing calf birth weights in dairy calves								JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE				95	12			7206	7209		10.3168/jds.2012-6051			DEC 2012	2012	The collection of calf birth weight on US dairies is not a common practice. Calf birth weight was collected on 3 dairies (2 Holstein herds and 1 Jersey herd) over a 6-wk period. All calf birth weights were collected less than 2 h after birth. A total of 872 calves were weighed by a spring scale and their weight was also estimated using a hoof circumference tape, with both weights and sex recorded. The general linear models procedure (PROC GLM; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used to estimate least squares means for spring scale birth weight along with sex of the calf and dairy. Calf spring scale versus hoof circumference-estimated birth weight was compared using the regression procedure (PROC REG; SAS Institute Inc.). Calf birth weight was also broken down into increments, and spring scale versus hoof circumference-estimated birth weight was compared by t-test. Bull calves had a heavier birth weight compared with heifer calves [36.7 +/- 0.4 kg (n = 450) vs. 34.6 +/- 0.4 kg (n = 422), respectively]. The dairy on which calves were born had a significant effect on calf birth weight [dairy 1: 36.8 +/- 0.4 kg (n = 204); dairy 2: 39.5 +/- 0.2 kg (n = 463); dairy 3: 25.9 +/- 0.4 kg (n = 205)]. When the spring scale calf birth weight was linearly regressed by hoof circumference-estimated birth weight, a significant relationship was observed, with an R-2 value of 0.91. For calves weighing less than 31.3 kg, the hoof circumference tape overestimated calf birth weight compared with the spring scale. However, for calves that weighed between 31.3 and 44.9 kg, no significant difference was observed between spring scale and hoof circumference tape-estimated birth weight. For calves weighing greater than 44.9 kg, the hoof circumference tape underestimated birth weight compared with the spring scale. Collection of calf BW by spring scale or estimated by hoof circumference tape appeared to be comparable for most calves because most calves weighed between 31 and 45 kg, but caution should be used for calves with a light or heavy birth weight.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0022-0302			WOS:000311192900038	23063164

Specifically, the roles that fiber size and shape, linear velocity, interstitial fraction, and column inner diameter play in separation efficiency were evaluated using a uracil and butylparaben mixture eluted under isocratic conditions. Four fiber types, having nominal diameters ranging from 30 to 65 mu m, were used in 250 mm x 2.1 mm columns. Optimum flow characteristics, as judged by plate height and resolution, were observed for 40 mu m diameter PP C-CP fibers packed at an interstitial fraction of similar to 0.63, over a broad range of linear velocities (similar to 2 to 37 mm/s). The influence of column inner diameter was studied on 1.5, 2.1, and 4.6 mm columns packed at the optimal interstitial fraction. The best performing column in terms of plate height and resolution was the 2.1 mm inner diameter. C-CP columns were also evaluated for the separation of a protein mixture composed of ribonuclease A, cytochrome c, and transferrin. Results obtained with the biomacromolecules mixture validate the optimal structural and operative conditions determined with the small solutes, laying the groundwork towards biomacromolecule applications, focusing more on the chemical aspects of separations.									13	0	0	9	0	13			1615-9306			WOS:000311574500004	23109248

Palmitoleic (16:1 cis-9) and cis-Vaccenic (18:1 cis-11) Acid Alter Lipogenesis in Bovine Adipocyte Cultures								LIPIDS				47	12			1143	1153		10.1007/s11745-012-3723-9			DEC 2012	2012	Our objectives were to: (1) confirm elongation products of palmitoleic acid (16:1 cis-9) elongation in vitro using stable isotopes and (2) evaluate if exogenous supplementation of palmitoleic acid, elongation products, or both are responsible for decreased desaturation and lipogenesis rates observed with palmitoleic acid supplementation in bovine adipocytes. Stromal vascular cultures were isolated from adipose tissue of two beef carcasses, allowed to reach confluence, held for 2 days, and differentiated with a standard hormone cocktail (day 0). On day 2, secondary differentiation media containing 1 of 4 fatty acid treatments [0 mu M fatty acid (control), or 150 mu M palmitic (16:0), palmitoleic, or cis-vaccenic (18:1 cis-11)] was added for 4 days. On day 6, cells were incubated with [C-13] 16:1, [C-13] 2, or [C-13] 18:0 to estimate elongation, lipogenic, and desaturation rates using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Enrichment of [C-13] 18:1 cis-11 confirmed 18:1 cis-11 is an elongation product of 16:1. Additionally, [C-13] label was seen in 20:1 cis-13 and cis-9, cis-11 CLA. Synthesis of [C-13] 16:0 from [C-13] 2 was reduced (P < 0.05) in palmitoleic acid and cis-vaccenic acid-treated compared with control cells following 36 h incubation. By 12 h of [C-13] 18:0 incubation, cells supplemented with palmitoleic acid had reduced (P < 0.05) [C-13] 18:1 cis-9 compared with all other treatments. Gene expression and fatty acid results support isotopic data for lipogenesis and desaturation. Therefore, palmitoleic acid is actively elongated in vitro and its elongation product, cis-vaccenic acid, can also reduce lipogenesis. However, inhibition of desaturation can be directly attributed to palmitoleic acid and not its elongation products, 18:1 cis-11 or 20:1 cis-13.									14	0	0	13	0	14			0024-4201			WOS:000311396700003	23077002

This article provides an overview of recent advances in the study of linear and nonlinear optical transitions associated mostly with tailored energy bandgaps. In particular, the optical absorption characteristics and photoluminescence emissions due to various induced bandgaps and, in some cases, the formation of graphene quantum dots are highlighted. Nonlinear optical properties of these materials are reviewed with an emphasis on optical limiting through both nonlinear absorption and scattering mechanisms.									11	0	0	0	0	11			0883-7694			WOS:000311491900017

The new polymers (P3-P5) incorporate recently developed 9,9-dihexyl-1,4-fluorenylene repeat units copolymerized with three different functional groups that are of interest for optoelectronic applications of organic semiconducting polymers (triphenylamine (P3), thiophene (P4) and carbazole (P5). The electrochemical properties were probed via cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry for new polymers P3-P5, as well as previously reported but not electrochemically characterized poly(p-phenylene vinylene) derivatives P1 and P2.

ANALYSIS OF ASYMMETRIC RO-VIBRATIONAL OH EMISSION LINES								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				760	2					153	10.1088/0004-637X/760/2/153			DEC 1 2012	2012	We present observations of ro-vibrational OH and CO emission from the Herbig Be star HD 100546. The emission from both molecules arises from the inner region of the disk extending from approximately 13 AU from the central star. The velocity profiles of the OH lines are narrower than the velocity profile of the [O I] lambda 6300 line, indicating that the OH in the disk is not cospatial with the O I. This suggests that the inner optically thin region of the disk is largely devoid of molecular gas. Unlike the ro-vibrational CO emission lines, the OH lines are highly asymmetric. We show that the average CO and average OH line profiles can be fit with a model of a disk comprised of an eccentric inner wall and a circular outer disk. In this model, the vast majority of the OH flux (75%) originates from the inner wall, while the vast majority of the CO flux (65%) originates on the surface of the disk at radii greater than 13 AU. Eccentric inner disks are predicted by hydrodynamic simulations of circumstellar disks containing an embedded giant planet. We discuss the implications of such a disk geometry in light of models of planet-disk tidal interactions and propose alternative explanations for the origin of the asymmetry.									15	0	0	0	0	15			0004-637X			WOS:000311217000057		
J	Maxson, Scott; Burg, Karen J. L.								Synergistic Effects of Conditioned Media and Hydrostatic Pressure on the Differentiation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells								CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR BIOENGINEERING				5	4			414	426		10.1007/s12195-012-0248-5			DEC 2012	2012	The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of mechanical stimuli in combination with conditioned media (CM) on the osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Two "opposing" groups were defined for the study. The first, designated the bone group, was formed by seeding MSCs onto porous poly(l-lactide-co-epsilon-caprolactone)/hydroxyapatite scaffolds. The second group, designated the cartilage group, was formed by encapsulating MSCs in 2% agarose. The samples were either subjected to hydrostatic pressure (HP), administered CM from the opposing group at a concentration of 50%, or given a combination of the two stimuli. The sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) content and SOX9, aggrecan, and collagen type II expressions suggest that both osteoblast CM and intermittent HP individually enhanced the chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs. In addition, there is evidence of a synergistic interaction between CM and HP on chondrogenic differentiation. The alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and osteocalcin and bone sialoprotein expression suggest that the combination of chondrocyte CM and HP significantly enhanced the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. However, the individual stimuli did not have a significant effect on osteogenic differentiation. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results revealed that both the chondrocyte CM and osteoblast CM contained considerable amounts of TGF-beta 1 and BMP-2.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1865-5025			WOS:000311391800005

However, rates of treatment-seeking among military personnel are relatively low, and the military environment poses several obstacles to engaging in effective clinical interventions. The current paper first reviews barriers and facilitators of treatment-seeking and engagement among military personnel, including stigma, practical barriers, perceptions of mental health problems, and attitudes towards treatment. Next, this paper reviews treatment adaptations and other interventions that are intended to reduce barriers to care among active duty and returning military personnel. These include early interventions, brief formats, integrating clinicians into the medical and military context, technology-based interventions, addressing negative treatment perceptions, screening/early identification, and enlisting unit support.

Faith Matters: Religious Affiliation and Public Opinion About Barack Obama's Foreign Policy in the "Greater" Middle East								SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY				93	5			1218	1242		10.1111/j.1540-6237.2012.00920.x			DEC 2012	2012	Objectives Despite the obvious relevance of religious themes and symbols in U.S. foreign policy since September 11, 2001, scholars know little about whether or how religious affiliation and behavior affect foreign policy attitudes. In this study, we endeavor to fill this gap in the literature. Methods We analyze the relationship between religious affiliation and public opinion about several dimensions of U.S. foreign policy in the Greater Middle East under President Barack Obama using pooled data from three surveys conducted in 2009 by the Pew Research Center. Results Our analysis indicates that the faith factor is a powerful force driving American attitudes about Obama's foreign policy. Specifically, seculars, mainline Protestants, and Catholics variously stand out as more moderate and more supportive of Obama when compared to evangelical Protestants. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that even when other determinants of foreign policy public opinion are controlled, religious affiliation has a powerful and independent impact on a wide array of foreign policy attitudes. Religion's impact on foreign policy attitudes thus is limited neither to the period immediately following September 11 nor to the administration of George W. Bush.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0038-4941	1540-6237		WOS:000310680000009

While President Obama uses executive agreements at similar levels as previous presidents, he has used the treaty mechanism far less often. This presents an interesting puzzle: Why has Obama used so few treaties when his own party controls the Senate? Methods We address this puzzle by analyzing Obama alongside other presidents in analyses of treaty use and in presidents experience with treaty delay employing ordinary least squares (OLS) and maximum likelihood estimation regression techniques. We also utilize the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) and Obama's use of treaty priority lists as qualitative case studies. Results The various findings together suggest that the rise of partisan polarization, including conservatives propensity to oppose significant treaties, factors into Obama's decisions to use treaties when completing major diplomacy. Conclusions The partisan context of the Senate provides a substantial constraint on presidents looking to cement important new foreign policies through international agreements.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0038-4941			WOS:000310680000013

The flow is both qualitatively and quantitatively influenced by the density of the fluid in the canyon, which is parameterized in terms of the flow Richardson number. A total of 26 experiments were conducted for Richardson numbers ranging from 0.08 to 4.5. For low Richardson numbers the canyon remains well mixed during the flushing process and the density difference decays exponentially (as observed in previous studies flushing a neutrally buoyant tracer). As the Richardson number increases the canyon becomes more stably stratified and the decay rate reduces. For very high Richardson numbers, a two-layer stratification is observed. Over time, for the two-layer case, the lower dense layer gets thinner, indicating that dense fluid is being skimmed from the top of the layer, and less dense, indicating that ambient fluid is being mixed down into the dense layer. Previous studies only observed flushing by skimming. The layer buoyancy decreases linearly over time until the shear layer reaches the bottom of the canyon at which point the rate of layer buoyancy reduction dramatically increases. Results also indicate that the density interface is thinner than the shear layer that is driving the mixing, and that the difference in thicknesses increases with an increasing Richardson number. This result is consistent with previous studies of mixing in stratified shear flows. The initial exponential decay rate was calculated for each experiment and is given by k = 1/(18 + 84Ri)(1.21). Following the initial period of exponential decay, the decay rate increases as the stratification weakens. Published by Elsevier Ltd.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1352-2310			WOS:000309789800045

A platform-assisted 3D inkjet bioprinting system has been proposed to fabricate 3D complex constructs such as zigzag tubes. Fibroblast (3T3 cell)-based tubes with an overhang structure have been successfully fabricated using the proposed bioprinting system. The post-printing 3T3 cell viability of printed cellular tubes has been found above 82% (or 93% with the control effect considered) even after a 72-h incubation period using the identified printing conditions for good droplet formation, indicating the promising application of the proposed bioprinting system. Particularly, it is proved that the tubular overhang structure can be scaffold-free fabricated using inkjetting, and the maximum achievable height depends on the inclination angle of the overhang structure. As a proof-of-concept study, the resulting fabrication knowledge helps print tissue-engineered blood vessels with complex geometry. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2012; 109: 31523160.

The role of tannin chemistry in this inhibitory process, in conjunction with enzyme classes and isoforms, is less well understood.Here, we compared the inhibition efficiencies of mixed tannins (MTs, mostly limited to angiosperms) and condensed tannins (CTs, produced mostly by gymnosperms) against the potential activity of beta-glucosidase (BG), N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (NAG), and peroxidase in two soils that differed in their vegetation histories.Compared with CTs, MTs exhibited 50% more inhibition of almond (Prunus dulcis) BG activity and greater inhibition of the potential NAG activity in the gymnosperm-acclimatized soils. CTs exhibited lower BG inhibition in the angiosperm-acclimated soils, whereas both types of tannins exhibited higher peroxidase inhibition in the angiosperm soils than in gymnosperm soils. At all of the tested tannin concentrations, irrespective of the tannin type and site history, the potential peroxidase activity was inhibited two-fold more than the hydrolase activity and was positively associated with the redox-buffering efficiency of tannins.Our finding that the inhibitory activities and mechanisms of MTs and CTs are dependent on the vegetative history and enzyme class is novel and furthers our understanding of the role of tannins and soil isoenzymes in decomposition.									12	0	0	12	0	12			0028-646X	1469-8137		WOS:000310676400019	23025512

Recent phylogenetic comparisons have supported this model of diversification for both insect herbivores and specialized pollinators. An exceptional case where contemporaneous plant-insect diversification might be expected is the obligate mutualism between fig trees (Ficus species, Moraceae) and their pollinating wasps (Agaonidae, Hymenoptera). The ubiquity and ecological significance of this mutualism in tropical and subtropical ecosystems has long intrigued biologists, but the systematic challenge posed by >750 interacting species pairs has hindered progress toward understanding its evolutionary history. In particular, taxon sampling and analytical tools have been insufficient for large-scale cophylogenetic analyses. Here, we sampled nearly 200 interacting pairs of fig and wasp species from across the globe. Two supermatrices were assembled: on an average, wasps had sequences from 77% of 6 genes (5.6 kb), figs had sequences from 60% of 5 genes (5.5 kb), and overall 850 new DNA sequences were generated for this study. We also developed a new analytical tool, Jane 2, for event-based phylogenetic reconciliation analysis of very large data sets. Separate Bayesian phylogenetic analyses for figs and fig wasps under relaxed molecular clock assumptions indicate Cretaceous diversification of crown groups and contemporaneous divergence for nearly half of all fig and pollinator lineages. Event-based cophylogenetic analyses further support the codiversification hypothesis. Biogeographic analyses indicate that the present-day distribution of fig and pollinator lineages is consistent with a Eurasian origin and subsequent dispersal, rather than with Gondwanan vicariance. Overall, our findings indicate that the fig-pollinator mutualism represents an extreme case among plant-insect interactions of coordinated dispersal and long-term codiversification.									84	7	0	82	0	90			1063-5157			WOS:000310376400008	22848088

In the research, albumin hydrolysate was purified and identified, tandem MS was adapted to characterise the amino acid sequences of peptides from the hydrolysate. In addition, anti-diabetic effects of the peptides with alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase inhibitory activity have been performed. The present work found eight novel peptides from albumin. Results also suggested that peptide KLPGF had alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity with an IC50 of 59.5 +/- 5.7 mu mol l(-1) and alpha-amylase inhibitory activity with an IC50 of 120.0 +/- 4.0 mu mol l(-1). In conclusion, the results revealed that the peptide KLPGF was a potential anti-diabetic inhibitor. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Wells, Jeremy C.; Baldwin, Elizabeth D.								Historic preservation, significance, and age value: A comparative phenomenology of historic Charleston and the nearby new-urbanist community of I'On								JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY				32	4			384	400		10.1016/j.jenvp.2012.06.002			DEC 2012	2012	While the age of physical environments is the central tenet of historic preservation, there is a lack of empirical evidence about how everyday people actually value, perceive, and experience age as an intrinsic part of an urban environment. In order to ameliorate this knowledge deficit, this study employs phenomenology to understand the lived experience of being in a "new" versus an "old" or "historic" urban residential environment. The new environment is the I'On new urbanist development in Mt. Pleasant, South Carolina, and the old environment is the location of the United States' first historic district in Charleston, South Carolina. These locations are approximately within five miles of each other. In both places, the physical characteristics of the built environment are remarkably similar in density, form, layout, and design, but the age is dramatically different. Through photo elicitation techniques and interviews, the results of this study reveal that residents of historic Charleston and l'On value their built environments in remarkably similar ways. Surprisingly, elements that evoke a strong sense of attachment tend to be landscape features, such as gates, fountains, trees, and gardens rather than buildings. The informants valued the "mystery" that they felt was part of the landscape and which consisted of layered elements such as fences, gates, and paths, such that these features (including buildings) had to be "discovered." Lastly, the informants strongly valued landscapes that showed "people care" through regular maintenance. The essential difference in people's experience and valuation of the new environment (I'On) and the old environment (historic Charleston) is in the older environment's ability to instill creative fantasies in the minds of the informants based on a hypothetical past of their own creation. The informants in l'On did not share these kinds of meanings. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									5	0	0	1	0	5			0272-4944			WOS:000309991100011

It was found that Ni, Co, and Fe are effective in enhancing densification of Mo-Si-B alloys, and Ni is the most effective sintering aid. This study supports a previously proposed hypothesis that activated sintering results from enhanced mass transport in the sintering-aid-induced quasi-liquid intergranular films (a type of grain boundary complexion). The relative effectiveness of these sintering aids can be rationalized by analyzing several key thermodynamic parameters that control the stability of premelting-like grain boundary complexions. Future studies are needed to develop interfacial thermodynamic models and methods for computing "grain boundary complexion (phase) diagrams" for multicomponent systems, which can be a useful component for the "Materials Genome" project that will enable better predictions of the activated sintering and other materials phenomena.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0022-2461			WOS:000309874400007

As a result, their applicability for representing the adsorption behavior of proteins with functionalized material surfaces should not be assumed. To address this issue, we conducted replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations of the adsorption behavior of structured peptides to functionalized surfaces using three protein force fields that are widely used for the simulation of peptide adsorption behavior: CHARMM22, AMBER94, and OPLS-AA. Simulation results for peptide structure both in solution and when adsorbed to the surfaces were compared to experimental results for similar peptide-surface systems to provide a means of evaluating and comparing the performance of these three force fields for this type of application. Substantial differences in both solution and adsorbed peptide conformations were found amongst these three force fields, with the CHARMM22 force field found to most closely match experimental results.									19	0	0	5	0	19			1934-8630			WOS:000307442400024	22589067

Molecular-level computational investigation of shock-wave mitigation capability of polyurea								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE				47	23			8197	8215		10.1007/s10853-012-6716-4			DEC 2012	2012	Various static and (equilibrium and non-equilibrium) dynamic molecular-level computational methods and tools are utilized in order to investigate the basic shock-wave physics and shock-wave material interactions in polyurea (a nano-phase segregated elastomeric co-polymer). The main goal of this investigation was to establish relationships between the nano-segregated polyurea microstructure (consisting of rod-shaped, discrete, so-called "hard domains" embedded into a highly compliant, so-called soft matrix) and the experimentally established superior capability of this material to disperse and attenuate resident shock waves (e.g., those generated as a result of blast-wave impact). By analyzing molecular-level interactions of the shock waves with polyurea, an attempt was made to identify and quantify main phenomena and viscous/inelastic deformation and microstructure-altering processes taking place at the shock front, which are most likely responsible for the superior shock-mitigation behavior of polyurea. Direct molecular-level simulations of shock-wave generation and propagation in the "strong-shock" regime are utilized in order to construct the appropriate shock-Hugoniot relations (relations which are used in the construction of the associated continuum-level material models). Extension of these relations into the "weak-shock" regime of interest from the traumatic brain injury prevention point of view is also discussed.									16	0	0	0	0	16			0022-2461			WOS:000308726500027

This paper provides a modified approach to analyze data from it. Herein, we combine porometry results with porosity measurements to improve prediction of the gas and liquid permeances through the membranes. Pore size distribution (PSD) and porosity measurements were performed for a range of membranes including symmetric and asymmetrically-stacked symmetric membranes, and an intrinsically asymmetric membrane. Our modified approach determines the tortuosity for each pore size bin (range) during the estimation of the PSD. For the symmetric MF membranes, there was high discrepancy between the measured mean pore size and the manufacturer's data, thus, reinforcing the importance of knowing the basis for membrane ratings. Our study also examined the effect of asymmetry on the measured PSD. The asymmetric membranes were found to give a smaller mean pore size compared to their symmetric component membranes. Additionally, the orientation of asymmetric membranes provided different results for both the mean pore size and tortuosity. A comparison between the common and modified approaches to analyze the data was made through the estimation of liquid permeances. Better correlation (at least a 7% improvement) of measured and estimated permeances for several fluids was found for our modified approach as compared to the classical methods because of the inclusion of a specific tortuosity for each pore size bin. The average tortuosity of the membranes under study varied from 0.936 to 5.020 with the larger nominal pore membranes having higher values compared to the smaller ones. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Meeting privacy challenges while advancing intelligent transportation systems								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES				25				34	45		10.1016/j.trc.2012.04.002			DEC 2012	2012	As transportation engineers and practitioners continue to advance the scope and breadth of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) applications, privacy is a primary concern of transportation agencies in the United States (US) when tracking people, vehicles and goods within the nation's transportation grid. As a number of technologies have rapidly advanced, including photo enforcement, electronic tolling, vehicle-mile taxing, weigh-in-motion, and Connected Vehicle technologies, research examining the privacy implications of system applications has lagged. In a recent national survey to determine how state departments of transportation (DOTs) are meeting the privacy needs of the traveling public, it was determined that DOTs favor aggregating and masking data for protecting privacy of motorists while collecting travel times and speeds. For capturing video surveillance, abiding by legislation or agency policies was the preferred method of protecting privacy. Unfortunately, there are no national standards in the US for the privacy protection of travelers as most privacy information merely takes the form of poorly defined precepts. With the increasing use of ITS applications, which are becoming more interwoven into the US transportation grid, there is a need to develop a national policy and related standards to ensure the privacy protection of the traveling public to ensure broader acceptance of ITS applications. The findings presented in this paper aim to provide direction on how to address the current and future privacy challenges that face the transportation industry. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

First, the PREMChlor model was calibrated to the plume using a deterministic approach to represent the site conditions prior to remediation activities, which occurred in 1999. The calibrated model was then used in a probabilistic mode to conduct a simulation of the effects of field source and plume remediation activities during the period after 1999. This probabilistic simulation considers uncertainties in seven key parameters: the initial source mass and concentration, the relationship between source mass removal and source concentration, the effectiveness of the source remediation, the groundwater velocity, the background plume degradation rate, and the plume treatment effectiveness. The simulation results compare favorably with the observed data collected after 1999, and show the influence of the remediation efforts on the plume.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1069-3629			WOS:000300043100012		
J	Verderber, Stephen; Todd, Lindsay G.								Reconsidering the Semiprivate Inpatient Room in US Hospitals								HERD-HEALTH ENVIRONMENTS RESEARCH & DESIGN JOURNAL				5	2			7	23					WIN 2012	2012	In the past 5 years, U. S. hospitals have virtually abandoned the semiprivate inpatient room. The inconclusiveness of recent research, however, indicates that this room type remains a potentially viable care delivery setting in both developed and developing countries for specific patient cohorts and care scenarios during hospitalization. Although the U.S. healthcare industry has embraced the all-private room hospital, does the semiprivate room have a place at all in the 21st-century American hospital? Literature on the subject, both for and against, is summarized. This is followed by a proposal for a case study prototype and its functional integration within a conventional medical/surgical unit in a U.S. hospital. The results suggest that a tempered reintroduction of semiprivatism affords opportunities for socialization, patient-family transactions and amenities, and staff effectiveness without compromising patient safety. Implications for environmental stewardship with respect to the carbon-neutral hospital of the 21st century are cited, as are priorities for further evidencebased design research on this issue.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1937-5867			WOS:000301021200002	23154899

Epiphytes influence the transformation of nitrogen in coniferous forest canopies								BOREAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH				17	6			411	424					NOV 30 2012	2012	The transformation of atmospherically-deposited nitrogen (N) by coniferous forest canopies has primarily been attributed to epiphytic lichens, despite microbes being present on leaf surfaces. We examined the relative contribution of live foliage with its epiphytic microbes and epiphytic lichen on N transformations in black spruce canopies. The epiphytic microbes and live foliage intercepted 27% of rainwater, 72% of incident nitrite + nitrate, and 63% of incident ammonium, while enriching throughfall with organic N by 52%. Epiphytic lichens on dead lower branches intercepted 60% of rainwater and depleted absolute amounts of inorganic and organic N, even though solute concentration increased as water passed through the lichens. Relationships were found between the number of colony forming units of epiphytic fungi and the depletion and enrichment of different forms of N in throughfall. Intensive forest management practices could result in the canopy being a net sink for N as a result of higher lichen biomass.									8	0	0	8	0	8			1239-6095			WOS:000311772500001

The optical emission spectra of the plasma showed that the oxygen flow affected the plasma properties, even though an oxygen plasma was not produced. The plasmid DNA strand breaks became more significant with the addition of oxygen flow to the helium in a single hollow, theta-shaped tube with other experimental conditions being unchanged.

Here, we describe a sensitive (15 ppb) and rapid (<1 mm) thiourea (TU) based self-assembly of citrate stabilized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) into ID arrays (or nanochains) through a non-crosslinking mechanism. The underlying principle for the nanochain formation is as follows: the displacement of negatively charged citrate with neutral TU in a Vroman-like effect introduces a surface polarity, which then drives the self-assembly of AuNPs into nanochains via the dipole-dipole interactions. Moreover, we find that the size of the nanochains can be controlled by regulating the strength of the resultant dipole, which depends on the physico-chemical parameters such as the zeta potential and hydrodynamic size. We further substantiate the dipole-based mechanistic pathway by demonstrating that addition of TU leads to a selective aggregation of electrostatically stabilized AuNP systems while sterically stabilized ones remain unaffected. The mechanism of ligand displacement (akin to Vroman effect) is supported by an increased sensitivity of the assembly process in the presence of NaHSO4. The soft-soft interactions of the gold-thione pair and the kinetics of ligand exchange were investigated and found to be influenced by the manner in which the substituents attached to the TU moiety modify the electron density around the thione sulphur. As demonstrated for TU detection (9.35 ppb) in sweet lime juice, the method serves as a simple, sensitive, selective, and rapid colorimetric assay for TU.									12	0	0	0	0	12			0959-9428			WOS:000310721400008

Upon photoexcitation, the brightly fluorescent carbon dots in aqueous solution served the function of excellent electron donors to reduce platinum(IV) and gold(III) compounds into their corresponding metals to be deposited on the dot surface. The deposited metals even in very small amounts were found to have dramatic quenching effects on the fluorescence emission intensities, but essentially no effects on the observed fluorescence decays. The obviously exclusive near-neighbor static quenching could be attributed to the disruption of electron-hole radiative recombinations (otherwise responsible for the fluorescence emissions in carbon dots). The results provide important evidence for the availability of photogenerated electrons that could be harvested for productive purposes, which in turn supports the current mechanistic framework on fluorescence emission and photoinduced redox properties of carbon dots.									37	1	0	6	0	37			0743-7463			WOS:000311864400016	23088301

In the shallow water equations, the pressure force term and the bed slope term are combined to eliminate numerical imbalance. The HLLC approximate Riemann solver is employed to calculate the numerical flux for the DG scheme. A slope limiting procedure used for compressible flows is adapted for modeling incompressible two-dimensional flows. A simple treatment for modeling flow over initially dry bed is presented. To validate the scheme, numerical tests are conducted to simulate hydraulic jump, partial dam break, circular dam break, wetting and drying in parabolic bowl, and a real world dam break in the Toce River. Numerical results show that this scheme can accurately model shock waves, wetting and drying, and flows in the channel with varying geometry and bed topography found in natural channels.

In many of these lasers, fiber nonlinearities are the main limits to further scaling. Although numerous specific techniques have studied for the suppression of a wide range of nonlinearities, the fundamental solution is to scale mode areas in fibers while maintaining sufficient single mode operation. Here the key problem is that more modes are supported once physical dimensions of waveguides are increased. The key to solve this problem is to look for fiber designs with significant higher order mode suppression. In conventional waveguides, all modes are increasingly guided in the center of the waveguides when waveguide dimensions are increased. It is hard to couple a mode out in order to suppress its propagation, which severely limits their scalability. In an all-solid photonic bandgap fiber, modes are only guided due to anti-resonance of cladding photonic crystal lattice. This provides strongly mode-dependent guidance, leading to very high differential mode losses. In addition, the all-solid nature of the fiber makes it easily spliced to other fibers. In this paper, we will show for the first time that all-solid photonic bandgap fibers with effective mode area of similar to 920 mu m(2) can be made with excellent higher order mode suppression.

FUNCTIONALITY OF A REDUCED PROBOSCIS: FLUID UPTAKE BY PHIGALIA STRIGATARIA (MINOT) (GEOMETRIDAE: ENNOMINAE)								JOURNAL OF THE LEPIDOPTERISTS SOCIETY				66	4			211	215					NOV 19 2012	2012	The structure and functionality of the reduced proboscis of males of P strigataria was studied. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a proboscis structurally similar to functional proboscises of other lepidopteran species, including chemo- and mechanosensilla and a tip-region with larger spaces between the dorsal legulae. Drops of red food coloring applied to the dorsal legulae entered the proboscis. Subsequent dissections exposed a complete and functional gut containing food coloring. We suggest that Lepidoptera with reduced proboscises might rely on capillarity as an initial step for fluid to enter the proboscis for subsequent uptake. Field observations are needed to determine if P strigataria, and other Lepidoptera with reduced proboscises, feed in their natural habitats.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0024-0966			WOS:000311818500004

The purpose of this analysis is to determine the monophyly of the D. monticola species-group and to determine the species-group placement of numerous unplaced Dasymutilla species. Taxonomic changes are made based on these results. New synonymy is proposed for Mutilla birkmani Melander 1903, female (=Dasymutilla corcyra Mickel 1928, female, syn. nov.; =Dasymutilla arcana Mickel 1928, male, syn. nov.), Mutilla macilenta Blake 1871, male (=Dasymutilla chattahoochei Bradley 1916, female, syn. nov.), Dasymutilla saetigera Mickel 1928, female (=Dasymutilla polia Mickel 1928, female, syn. nov.). The currently associated male of D. chattahoochei belongs to D. arenerronea (female), stat. resurr., which was previously recognized as a synonym of D. chattahoochei. The currently recognized male of D. archboldi belongs to D. vesta; the true male of D. archboldi is newly described. Dasymutilla vesta, D. radkei, and D. archboldi are transferred into the D. monticola species-group. A male identified as D. fasciventris (male), which has gray apical tergal setae like many males of the D. monticola species-group, was recognized as a member of the D. quadriguttata species-group; the true D. fasciventris was not studied. Dasymutilla chalcocephala (female) and D. spilota (female), which bear a superficial resemblance to the D. monticola species-group, are determined to not belong to any currently recognized species-group. Inferences are made about the homology of tubercles on the female's posterior margin of the head, the necessity for phylogenetic research on species-group placement, and the necessity for both morphological and molecular data.									3	0	0	4	0	4			1175-5326	1175-5334		WOS:000311501200001

Known to support 86 species recognized by the US Fish and Wildlife Service as threatened or endangered, isolated wetlands are a conservation priority in the United States and elsewhere. They are often obscure and methods to detect them at the spatial scales necessary for systematic conservation planning and forest management have been time consuming, cost ineffective, or too coarse-filter. To fill existing information gaps and develop a repeatable, high-resolution methodology, we subjected LiDAR elevation data to custom relief models designed to elucidate fine-scale geomorphology, specifically small, localized changes in concavity, as a location predictor. Because fine grain size and large spatial extent can impose processing limits in landscape-level analysis, we executed our workflow in a high-throughput computing (HTC) environment, which achieved a 91x time-savings over our 55,000 ha study area. We conducted field validation at 114 randomly selected sites to measure model commission (14.9%), approximate omission (5.3%) error rates and estimate wetland boundaries. Depressional wetlands predicted in this study (n = 4610) were mostly small ((x) over bar = 0.37 +/- 0.69 ha) and previously unmapped sites. The mapping accuracy of this effort (85.1%) suggests that local relief models captured slight geomorphologic changes that successfully predict wetland boundaries in low-relief ecosystems. Many small wetlands are centers of biodiversity in forested landscapes and such analyses will provide information and improved methods for landscape-scale management and conservation.

J	Wu, Tonggui; Dong, Yi; Yu, Mukui; Wang, G. Geoff; Zeng, De-Hui								Leaf nitrogen and phosphorus stoichiometry of Quercus species across China								FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT				284				116	123		10.1016/j.foreco.2012.07.025			NOV 15 2012	2012	Leaf stoichiometry patterns and their controlling factors at different scales, such as the global flora or single species/genus, are still poorly understood. Here, we analyzed a national-level dataset of leaf nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations and their stoichiometry for 13 Quercus species from 41 study sites in China, aiming to document the patterns of leaf N and P concentrations and N:P ratio to investigate how these patterns vary with geographic and climatic variables. The averages of leaf N and P concentrations and N:P ratio were 17.27 mg g(-1), 1.54 mg g(-1) and 13.96, respectively, across all Quercus species studied. Significant differences in leaf N and P concentrations were detected, while no significant difference in leaf N:P ratio was found among species. Leaf N and P concentrations and N:P ratio showed single-peak curves or linear patterns along the geographic and climatic gradients. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that the first PCA axis, which reflected the temperature and evaporation variations along the altitude and longitude, had good relationships with leaf N and P concentrations and N:P ratio. The second PCA axis, which reflected temperature and moisture variations along the latitude, only showed a significantly correlation with leaf N concentration. Leaf N:P ratio was well constrained to a relatively stable range for Quercus species and was less influenced by environmental variables. Leaf N and P concentrations were mainly driven by heat and water distribution induced through geographic variations. Leaf stoichiometry-geography relationships are more complicated than stoichiometry-climate relationships. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

A pentane enrichment culture cometabolized EDB, with a transformation capacity of 0.35 mu mol EDB/mg biomass (66.2 mu g EDB/mg biomass) in the absence of growth substrate. It also cometabolized EDB while actively growing on pentane. However, enrichment cultures grown on benzene or toluene could not cometabolize EDB, with or without their respective growth substrates.									4	0	0	4	0	4			1871-6784			WOS:000309888300007	22613211

The "balanced placebo design'' has been proposed to allow better separation of drug and placebo effects.Methods: Sixty-four healthy participants (32 women) were randomly assigned to receive an antiemetic ginger preparation or placebo, and half of each group was told to have received drug or placebo. They were exposed to 5x2 min body rotations to induce nausea. Subjective symptoms and behavioral (rotation tolerance, head movements) and physiological measures (electrogastrogram, cortisol) were recorded. Groups were balanced for sex of participants and experimenters.Results: Ginger and the information given did not affect any outcome measure, and previous sex differences could not be confirmed. Adding the experimenters revealed a significant four-factorial interaction on behavioral but not on subjective or physiological measures Men who received placebo responded to placebo information when provided by the male experimenter, and to ginger information when provided by the female experimenter. This effect was not significant in women.Conclusion: The effects of an antiemetic drug and provided information interact with psychosocial variables of participants and experimenters in reports of nausea.									6	0	0	4	0	6			1932-6203			WOS:000311234600019	23152846

Based on visual detection and measurement of mechanical resonances in ZnO NWs using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), previous studies have attributed dynamic charge induction as the fundamental mechanism for the observed resonances. We show that the use of an electron beam as a resonance detection tool alters the intrinsic electrical character of the ZnO, and makes it difficult to identify the source of the charge necessary for the electrostatic actuation. A systematic study of the amplitude of electrically actuated as-grown and gold-coated ZnO NWs in the presence (absence) of an electron beam using a SEM (dark-field optical microscope) suggest that our ZnO NWs intrinsically support static charge actuation.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1098-0121			WOS:000310988700002

Improved accuracy in regularization models of incompressible flow via adaptive nonlinear filtering								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL METHODS IN FLUIDS				70	7			805	828		10.1002/fld.2732			NOV 10 2012	2012	We study the adaptive nonlinear filtering in the Leray regularization model for incompressible, viscous Newtonian flow. The filtering radius is locally adjusted so that resolved flow regions and coherent flow structures are not filtered out, which is a common problem with these types of models. A numerical method is proposed that is unconditionally stable with respect to time step and decouples the problem so that the filtering becomes linear at each time step and is decoupled from the system. Several numerical examples are given that demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0271-2091	1097-0363		WOS:000309447800001

Cyt b gene introns were frequently present in the fungal kingdom and some lower plants, but generally absent or rare in Chromista, Protozoa, and Animalia. Fungal Cyt b introns were found at 35 positions in Cyt b genes and the number of introns varied at individual positions from a single representative to 32 different introns at position 131, showing a wide and patchy distribution. Many homologous introns were present at the same position in distantly related species but absent in closely related species, suggesting that introns of the Cyt b genes were frequently lost. On the other hand, highly similar intron sequences were observed in some distantly related species rather than in closely related species, suggesting that these introns were gained independently, likely through lateral transfers. The intron loss-and-gain events could be mediated by transpositions that might have occurred between nuclear and mitochondria. Southern hybridization analysis confirmed that some introns contained repetitive sequences and might be transposable elements. An intron gain in Botryotinia fuckeliana prevented the development of Qol fungicide resistance, suggesting that intron loss-and-gain events were not necessarily beneficial to their host organisms.									7	1	0	7	0	8			1932-6203			WOS:000311935800202	23145081

ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				46	21			12178	12185		10.1021/es303303g			NOV 6 2012	2012	The effects of ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) interacting with single-celled green algae, Chlorella sp., have been found to be bilateral. Specifically, our electron microscopy, plant cell, and fluorescence assays showed that the adsorption and aggregation of ZnO NPs compromised algal cell morphology, viability, and membrane integrity, resulting from zinc ion dissolution as well as possible mechanical cell damage induced by the NPs. Conversely, algal cells displayed a remarkable capability of self-protection by minimizing their surface area through aggregation mediated by the oppositely charged metal ions and suppressing zinc ion release from the NPs through exudation, as evidenced by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, zeta potential, and attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. This study illustrates the adaptive nature and complexity in potential ecological response to discharged nanomaterials.									25	1	0	20	0	25			0013-936X			WOS:000310665000084	23046143

Because hox genes play pivotal developmental roles in bilaterian animals [6-8], we analyzed the Hox complexes of two hemichordate genomes. We find that Saccoglossus kowalevskii and Ptychodera flava both possess 12-gene clusters, with mir10 between hox4 and hox5, in 550 kb and 452 kb intervals, respectively. Genes hox1-hox9/10 of the clusters are in the same genomic order and transcriptional orientation as their orthologs in chordates, with hox1 at the 3' end of the cluster. At the 5' end, each cluster contains three posterior genes specific to Ambulacraria (the hemichordate-echinoderm clade), two forming an inverted terminal pair. In contrast, the echinoderm Strongylocentrotus purpuratus contains a 588 kb cluster [9] of 11 orthologs of the hemichordate genes, ordered differently, plausibly reflecting rearrangements of an ancestral hemichordate-like ambulacrarian cluster. Hox clusters of vertebrates and the basal chordate amphioxus [10] have similar organization to the hemichordate cluster, but with different posterior genes. These results provide genomic evidence for a well-ordered complex in the deuterostome ancestor for the hox1-hox9/10 region, with the number and kind of posterior genes still to be elucidated.									21	0	0	18	0	21			0960-9822			WOS:000311060200028	23063438

This experiment used a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over design to explore the effects of a four week regimen of 50 mg oral DHEA on performance on the digit span, verbal span, and modified Sternberg (Oberauer) tasks. The results demonstrate that the current regimen of drug administration significantly increases serum levels of DHEA, DHEAS, testosterone and estrone and substantially alters the patterns of correlations among the serum levels of these hormones. Despite this substantial change in the hormonal milieu, DHEA administration produced no beneficial effects on cognitive performance in the digit span, verbal span, or modified Sternberg paradigm tasks. Ancillary analyses of the relation between hormone levels and cognitive performance demonstrated a strong positive correlation between DHEA levels and performance on digit span forward/backward and verbal span forward in the placebo drug condition, but not in the DHEA condition. We interpret the juxtaposition of the null results of DHEA administration and the correlation of DHEA levels and performance in the placebo condition to indicate that the referenced correlations arise because a third variable (i.e., age) is associated with both performance and DHEA levels. Additional analyses supported this hypothesis. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									6	0	0	4	0	6			0006-8993			WOS:000311174900006	22985672

Increased productivity in bioenergy production can be achieved through concomitant gains in processing efficiency as well as genetic improvement of feedstock that have the potential for bioenergy production at an industrial scale. The purpose of this review is to explore the genetic and genomic resource landscape for the improvement of a specific bioenergy feedstock group, the C4 bioenergy grasses. First, bioenergy grass feedstock traits relevant to biochemical conversion are examined. Then we outline genetic resources available bioenergy grasses for mapping bioenergy traits to DNA markers and genes. This is followed by a discussion of genomic tools and how they can be applied to understanding bioenergy grass feedstock trait genetic mechanisms leading to further improvement opportunities.									19	0	0	17	0	19			1754-6834			WOS:000311486500001	23122416

A self-organization based optical flow estimator with GPU implementation								MACHINE VISION AND APPLICATIONS				23	6			1229	1242		10.1007/s00138-011-0352-x			NOV 2012	2012	This work describes a parallelizable optical flow field estimator based upon a modified batch version of the Self-Organizing Map (SOM). This estimator handles the ill-posedness in gradient-based motion estimation via a novel combination of regression and self-organization. The aperture problem is treated using an algebraic framework that partitions motion estimates obtained from regression into two sets: one (set H (c) ) containing motion estimates with high confidence and another (set H (p) ) with low confidence. The self-organization step uses a uniquely designed pair of sets: training set (Q = H (c) ) and the initial weights set (). It is shown that with this specific choice of training and initial weights sets, the interpolation of flow vectors is achieved primarily due to the regularization property of the SOM. Moreover, the computationally involved step of finding the winner unit in SOM simplifies to indexing into a 2D array making the algorithm highly scalable. To preserve flow discontinuities at occlusion boundaries, we have designed an anisotropic neighborhood function for SOM that uses a novel optical flow constraint equation residual-based distance measure. A multi-resolution or pyramidal approach is used to estimate large motion. As self-organization based motion estimation is computationally intense, parallel processing on graphics processing units is used for speedup. As the algorithm is data (rather datum) parallel, with sufficient number of computing cores, the implementation of the estimator can be made real time. With the available ground truth from Middlebury database, error metrics like average angular error and average end point error are computed and are shown to be comparable with other leading techniques.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0932-8092			WOS:000309875400012

MARINE TECHNOLOGY SOCIETY JOURNAL				46	6			38	48					NOV-DEC 2012	2012	Excavation of the Civil War submarine H.L.. Hunley, raised from the seabed off Charleston, South Carolina, has revealed large hull breaches in the fore and aft sections of the vessel. Initially, the damage was thought to have occurred the night the pioneering submarine sank in 1864, but recent hull forensic studies indicate that the two largest breaches in the submarine's ballast tanks occurred due to natural and site-specific seabed conditions and did not contribute to the submarine's demise. To reconstruct and interpret these conditions, a new methodology has been developed that utilizes forensic data embedded in the marine concretion covering the iron hull. Results from an experiment conducted to test the theory further support the notion that the largest breaches were likely caused by the combined effects of erosion and corrosion of the iron hull in the marine environment.

TOLUENE OXIDATION KINETICS AND MECHANISM OF NI-OLIVINE CATALYSTS SYNTHESIZED VIA ELECTROLESS DEPOSITION AND THERMAL IMPREGNATION								TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE				55	6			2273	2283					NOV-DEC 2012	2012	The production of synthesis gas (syngas) involves the gasification of biomass under oxygen-limited conditions, which also produces tars. Tars pose significant problems for mechanical devices by depositing on piping, resulting in clogging and engine fouling. While recent research has shown that thermally impregnated Ni-olivine has been effective in reforming tars into H-2 and CO, this technique possessed limited economic feasibility due to high input energy requirements. Thus, stable, active, and inexpensive catalysts are required for effective and efficient conditioning of syngas. This research compared the activity of Ni-olivine catalysts synthesized via electroless plating (ELF) (35 degrees C) and thermal impregnation (TI) (1400 degrees C) for oxiding toluene in a flow-through reactor The objectives were to (1) determine the kinetics of toluene oxidation, (2) propose a reaction mechanism for toluene oxidation, and (3) investigate the effect of syngas on toluene oxidation. Conversion of toluene using Ni-olivine catalysts increased with increasing ozone concentration and temperature, as well as decreasing toluene molar flow rate, and facilitated the complete oxidation of toluene. The information obtained from this research is expected to provide opportunities for efficient cleanup of tars from biomass gasification facilities at lower temperatures.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2151-0032			WOS:000313998700024

The objective of this study is to examine the factors that influence these two TBI crash groups.Methods: Data from the Iowa Department of Public Health's Brain Injury Registry and Department of Transportation's crash records were linked together and used in logistic regression models to predict the likelihood of a driver sustaining a TBI in a crash and those who drive after a TBI.Results: Between 2001 and 2006, there were 2382 crashes in which an individual sustained a TBI. As expected, a higher likelihood of sustaining a TBI was observed for motorcycle drivers who did not wear a helmet and in crashes that resulted in total or disabling vehicle damage. Focusing specifically on the post-TBI drivers (and not occupants), 1583 were involved in crashes. These post-TBI drivers were less likely to wear seatbelts or have passengers in the vehicle at the time of the crash, and were more likely to crash at night. Post-TBI drivers were also involved in significantly more multiple crashes (about 14%) when compared to drivers who have not experienced a TBI (about 10%) during the study period. When controlling for gender, date of injury, and severity of TBI (using Glasgow Coma Scale), individuals that sustained a TBI when they were younger were more likely to be involved in multiple crashes.Conclusions: Different factors influence the crash likelihood for those that sustain a TB! in a crash and those that crash following a TBI. In general, post-TBI drivers have a higher occurrence of multiple crashes and this should be further explored to guide driver rehabilitation, evaluation, and training. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

East versus West: Organic contaminant differences in brown pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis) eggs from South Carolina, USA and the Gulf of California, Mexico								SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT				438				527	532		10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.08.055			NOV 1 2012	2012	Brown pelicans (Peleconus occidentalis) were listed as endangered in the United States in 1970, largely due to reproductive failure and mortality caused by organochlorine contaminants, such as DDT. The southeast population, P.o. carolinensis, was delisted in 1985, while the west coast population. P.o. californicus, was not delisted until 2009. As fish-eating coastal seabirds, brown pelicans may serve as a biomonitors. Organic contaminants were examined in brown pelican eggs collected from the Gulf of California in 2004 and South Carolina in 2005 using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Contaminants were compared using all individual data as well as statistically pooled samples to provide similar sample sizes with little difference in results. Principal components analysis separated the Gulf of California brown pelican eggs from the South Carolina eggs based on contaminant patterns. The South Carolina population had significantly (P<0.05) higher levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chlordanes, dieldrin and mirex, while the Gulf of California eggs had higher levels of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) and hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs). With the exception of dieldrin and brominated diphenyl ether (BDE) 47, this pattern was observed for mussel and oyster tissues from these regions, indicating the need for further study into the differences between east and west coast brown pelican populations and ecosystem contamination patterns.

Base-2 Expansions for Linearizing Products of Functions of Discrete Variables								OPERATIONS RESEARCH				60	6			1477	1490		10.1287/opre.1120.1106			NOV-DEC 2012	2012	This paper presents an approach for representing functions of discrete variables, and their products, using logarithmic numbers of binary variables. Given a univariate function whose domain consists of n distinct values, it begins by employing a base-2 expansion to express the function in terms of the ceiling of log(2) n binary and n continuous variables, using linear restrictions to equate the functional values with the possible binary realizations. The representation of the product of such a function with a nonnegative variable is handled via an appropriate scaling of the linear restrictions. Products of m functions are treated in an inductive manner from i = 2 to m, where each step i uses such a scaling to express the product of function i and a nonnegative variable denoting a translated version of the product of functions 1 through i - 1 as a newly defined variable. The resulting representations, both in terms of one function and many, are important for reformulating general discrete variables as binary, and also for linearizing mixed-integer generalized geometric and discrete nonlinear programs, where it is desired to economize on the number of binary variables. The approach provides insight into, improves upon, and subsumes related linearization methods for products of functions of discrete variables.

J	Liao, Yi; Hubing, Todd H.; Su, Donglin					Hubing, Todd/0000-0003-0154-2189			Equivalent Circuit With Frequency-Independent Lumped Elements for Coated Wire Antennas								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ANTENNAS AND PROPAGATION				60	11			5419	5423		10.1109/TAP.2012.2207697			NOV 2012	2012	A 7-element lumped-parameter equivalent circuit is derived for wire antennas coated with a thin dielectric and/or magnetic material. The derivation is based on a method for transforming any coating to an equivalent magnetic coating on a wire with a different radius. The derived circuit is composed of a five-element sub-circuit for bare wire antennas plus a two-element parallel circuit for modeling magnetic coatings. Compared to full-wave simulations and measurements, this equivalent circuit provides reasonably accurate results over a broad frequency range that includes the first resonance. It can be used to estimate the input impedance of a coated antenna without requiring an EM solver. It can also be used to model coated antennas in circuit simulations.									2	1	0	0	0	3			0018-926X			WOS:000312030600047		
J	Joerg, Sophie; Hodgins, Jessica; Safonova, Alla								Data-driven Finger Motion Synthesis for Gesturing Characters								ACM TRANSACTIONS ON GRAPHICS				31	6					189	10.1145/2366145.2366208			NOV 2012	2012	Capturing the body movements of actors to create animations for movies, games, and VR applications has become standard practice, but finger motions are usually added manually as a tedious post-processing step. In this paper, we present a surprisingly simple method to automate this step for gesturing and conversing characters. In a controlled environment, we carefully captured and post-processed finger and body motions from multiple actors. To augment the body motions of virtual characters with plausible and detailed finger movements, our method selects finger motion segments from the resulting database taking into account the similarity of the arm motions and the smoothness of consecutive finger motions. We investigate which parts of the arm motion best discriminate gestures with leave-one-out cross-validation and use the result as a metric to select appropriate finger motions. Our approach provides good results for a number of examples with different gesture types and is validated in a perceptual experiment.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0730-0301			WOS:000311298900063		
J	Parris, J. Kevin; Touchell, Darren H.; Ranney, Thomas G.; Adelberg, Jeffrey								Basal Salt Composition, Cytokinins, and Phenolic Binding Agents Influence In Vitro Growth and Ex Vitro Establishment of Magnolia 'Ann'								HORTSCIENCE				47	11			1625	1629					NOV 2012	2012	In vitro growth responses of Magnolia 'Ann' to basal salt composition, cytokinins, and phenolic binding agents were investigated in a series of experiments to refine micropropagation protocols. Murashige and Skoog (MS), half-strength MS, Woody Plant Medium (WPM), Driver and Kuniyuki (DKW), and Blaydes basal salts in conjunction with 1 g.L-1 activated charcoal (AC) or 1 g.L-1 polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) were evaluated as multiplication media. Benzylaminopurine (BAP), meta-topolin (mT), or 6-(gamma,gamma-dimethylallylamino) purine (2iP) at 2, 4, or 8 mu M was investigated to optimize the cytokinin concentration. Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with 2 mu M BAP with no phenolic binding agent was an optimal multiplication medium that yielded 3.2 +/- 0.2 shoots with a mean length of 17.2 +/- 1.8 mm over an 8-week period. For rooting, microshoots were cultured on half-strength MS media supplemented with 0, 5, 10, or 20 mu M indolebutyric acid (IBA) with or without AC. Media containing AC produced elongated microshoots suitable for rooting and ex vitro establishment. Microshoots cultured on medium supplemented with AC also had higher in vitro rooting (16%) and higher ex vitro rooting (75%) compared with those without AC regardless of in vitro IBA concentration.									4	0	0	4	0	6			0018-5345			WOS:000311761900012		
J	Quarles, C. Derrick, Jr.; Manard, Benjamin T.; Burdette, Carolyn Q.; Marcus, R. Kenneth								Roles of electrode material and geometry in liquid sampling-atmospheric pressure glow discharge (LS-APGD) microplasma emission spectroscopy								MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL				105		SI		48	55		10.1016/j.microc.2012.01.012			NOV 2012	2012	The roles of the electrode material and geometry on the performance of the liquid sampling-atmospheric pressure glow discharge (LS-APGD) optical emission spectroscopy source are described. The LS-APGD source has been interfaced to a high resolution JY RF-5000 polychromator allowing for simultaneous multiple element detection. This LS-APGD source operates at currents of 20-60 mA and solution flow rates of 0.1-0.4 mL min(-1). A glow discharge is generated between the surface of the electrolyte test solution exiting a glass capillary and the end of a metallic counterelectrode. Described here is an evaluation of how the counterelectrode material identity (copper, nickel, and stainless steel) and the electrode configuration (geometry) influence the analyte emission responses for a test solution containing Ag, Cr, Cu, Mg, Ni, and Zn in 1 M HNO3. Studies of the effect of liquid flow rates reveal that 0.3 mL min(-1) provides optimal analyte emission responses as it relates to peak intensity, peak area, and peak widths. Use of nickel as the counterelectrode material provided the best reproducibility for analyte emission responses with 8.9-13.0%RSDs for 50 mu L injections of 100 mu g mL(-1) test solutions, while copper and stainless steel electrodes had %RSDs of 3-5 times higher than the nickel electrode. The role of the electrode geometries were evaluated previously-used 180 degrees (co-linear) arrangement as well as for different configurations with the electrodes mounted at 90 degrees with respect to each other, with the most intense optical emission responses found for the 180 degrees geometry. Solution-based limits of detection (LOD) were found to be in the range of 0.44-0.93 mu g mL(-1) for Ag, Cu, Mg, Ni, and Zn using the nickel electrode at the 180 degrees geometry. Based on the use of 50 mu L injections, this represents absolute detection limits of 22-46 ng. LODs were approximately an order of magnitude higher for the copper and stainless steel electrodes.

J	Atkinson, Jeffrey L.; McCarty, Lambert B.; Bridges, William C., Jr.								Effect of Core Aerification Frequency, Area Impacted, and Topdressing Rate on Turf Quality and Soil Physical Properties								AGRONOMY JOURNAL				104	6			1710	1715		10.2134/agronj2012.0224			NOV-DEC 2012	2012	Soil compaction often occurs in heavily trafficked turf areas such as golf course putting greens and sports fields. Although research exists on benefits of proper aerification, insufficient data exists quantifying the effect of removing, or "impacting," specific amounts of surface area per year, number of aerification events per year, or amount of topdressing applied post-aerification on turfgrass quality and soil physical properties. Understanding these effects was the objective of this study. The study was conducted on a 10-yr-old U.S. Golf Association (USGA)-specified TifEagle bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. x C. transvaalensis Burtt Davy] research putting green to evaluate two yearly totals of percent surface area impacted, 15 and 25, summed through one, two, or three aerification events per year, with cores removed. Following aerification, treatments received one of two topdressing rates; the mathematical equivalent of soil removed with aerification or half this rate. Turf quality declined for similar to 4 wk after each aerification event, at which point it typically improved. Increasing number of aerification events per year from one to three reduced bulk density (BD) between 5 and 9%, surface hardness between 5 and 19%, and thatch mat organic matter content 10% in Year 2. Infiltration rates were highest in single aerification event treatments during the same year. Overall, increasing amount of surface area impacted and number of aerification events per year improved soil physical properties. Reducing frequency of aerification while impacting the same amount of surface area per year increased overall visual turfgrass quality while not yielding similar improvements in soil physical properties.									2	1	0	1	0	3			0002-1962			WOS:000310767200026		
J	Putman, Bradley J.; Kline, Laura C.								Comparison of Mix Design Methods for Porous Asphalt Mixtures								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING				24	11			1359	1367		10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0000529			NOV 2012	2012	Porous asphalt mixtures have been used for more than 60 years, but it was not until 1974 that the first formalized procedure was created by the Federal Highway Administration to design mixtures for open-graded friction courses (OGFC). Since that time, there have been several other mix design procedures developed and adapted, mainly for OGFCs on high-volume roadways. In the past decade, porous asphalt pavements have been gaining popularity as a storm water best management practice and utilize similar mixtures as those used for OGFCs. However, for any porous mixtures to perform as intended, they must be designed and constructed properly. Across the United States, there are currently more than 20 different methods used to design these mixtures. The objective of this research was to compare the different mix design procedures currently used in the United States. The results indicated that some of the procedures result in a range of design binder contents instead of a single value. This does not provide much guidance to inexperienced designers, which could result in pavement performance issues that could deter the future use of porous asphalt mixtures.

J	Raman, Roopa; Bharadwaj, Anandhi								Power Differentials and Performative Deviation Paths in Practice Transfer: The Case of Evidence-Based Medicine								ORGANIZATION SCIENCE				23	6			1593	1621		10.1287/orsc.1110.0708			NOV-DEC 2012	2012	Practice transfer processes in organizations often do not proceed as planned. Prior literature has viewed unplanned deviations as undesirable, emphasizing ways to reduce or overcome them. Performative deviations refer to such unplanned deviations in the actual performance of practice transfer processes from the prescribed intentions of the organization. In this research, we seek to provide a fine-grained analysis of the nature of performative deviation paths through which practice transfer processes unfold by focusing on the role of power differentials. We find that power differentials among transfer participants can cause the unfolding practice transfers to deviate from prescribed processes along one of two alternative paths-the agency-based performative deviation path or the knowledge-based performative deviation path. Although the agency-based performative deviation path hinders successful practice transfer, the knowledge-based performative deviation path can actually be helpful to organizations. We draw on the dual-nature framework of organizational routines and the pluralist lens of power as our theoretical foundation and evidence-based medicine in healthcare as our empirical context to derive a set of propositions about the different performative deviation paths through which practice transfer processes unfold, based on the nature of power differentials among work roles involved in practice transfer and the different outcomes that result. The roles of outcome uncertainty and information technology are also presented.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1047-7039			WOS:000311328400004		
J	Singapogu, Ravikiran B.; Smith, Dane E.; Long, Lindsay O.; Burg, Timothy C.; Pagano, Christopher C.; Burg, Karen J. L.								Objective Differentiation of Force-Based Laparoscopic Skills Using a Novel Haptic Simulator								JOURNAL OF SURGICAL EDUCATION				69	6			766	773		10.1016/j.jsurg.2012.07.008			NOV-DEC 2012	2012	BACKGROUND: There is a growing need for effective surgical simulators to train the novice resident with a core skill set that can be later used in advanced operating room training. The most common simulator-based laparoscopic skills curriculum, the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Skills (FLS), has been demonstrated to effectively teach basic surgical skills; however, a key deficiency in current surgical simulators is lack of validated training for force-based or haptic skills. In this study, a novel haptic simulator was examined for construct validity by determining its ability to differentiate between the force skills of surgeons and novices.METHODS: A total of 34 participants enrolled in the study and were divided into two groups: novices, with no previous surgical experience and surgeons, with some level of surgical experience (including upper level residents and attendings). All participants performed a force-based task using grasping, probing, or sweeping motions with laparoscopic tools on the simulator. In the first session, participants were given 3 trials to learn specific forces associated with locations on a graphic; after this, they were asked to reproduce forces at each of the locations in random order. A force-based metric (score) was used to record performance.RESULTS: On probing and grasping tasks, novices applied significantly greater overall forces than surgeons. When analyzed by force levels, novices applied greater forces on the probing task at lower and mid-range forces, for grasping at low-range forces ranges and, for sweeping at high-range forces.CONCLUSIONS: The haptic simulator successfully differentiated between novice and surgeon force skill level at specific ranges for all 3 salient haptic tasks, establishing initial construct validity of the haptic simulator. Based on these results, force-based simulator metrics may be used to objectively measure haptic skill level and potentially train residents. Haptic simulator development should focus on the 3 salient haptic skills (grasping, probing, and sweeping) where precise force application is necessary for successful task outcomes.

Silagadze, Zurab/K-8970-2013				When physics helps mathematics: Calculation of the sophisticated multiple integral								PHYSICS OF PARTICLES AND NUCLEI				43	6			882	888		10.1134/S1063779612060068			NOV 2012	2012	There exists a remarkable connection between the quantum mechanical Landau-Zener problem and purely classical-mechanical problem of a ball rolling on a Cornu spiral. This correspondence allows us to calculate a complicated multiple integral, a kind of multi-dimensional generalization of Fresnel integrals. A direct method of calculation is also considered but found to be successful only in some low-dimensional cases. As a byproduct of this direct method, an interesting new integral representation for zeta(2) is obtained.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1063-7796			WOS:000310749500007		
J	Bobek, Donna D.; Daugherty, Brian E.; Radtke, Robin R.								Resolving Audit Engagement Challenges through Communication								AUDITING-A JOURNAL OF PRACTICE & THEORY				31	4			21	45		10.2308/ajpt-50210			NOV 2012	2012	This paper investigates the successful resolution of audit challenges faced by auditing professionals. We use an experiential questionnaire (EQ) (Gibbins and Qu 2005) to elicit practicing auditors' experiences with resolving challenges personally encountered on an audit engagement. One hundred ninety-seven auditing professionals from all levels (staff to partners) and firm types (local to Big 4) responded to our EQ, and 130 provided complete information about a self-identified challenge they had encountered. Over 70 percent of these challenges were successfully resolved wherein communication with other auditors on the engagement, along with communication with the client, aided most in the resolution process. These results provide evidence confirming theory-based research indicating the importance of knowledge sharing for CPAs (Vera-Munoz et al. 2006). Our findings also extend prior research on the components of professional judgment (Gibbins and Emby 1985; Emby and Gibbins 1988; Gibbins and Mason 1988) by providing insight into the potentially troublesome area of challenges that are often encountered during an audit, and how effective communication can lead to successful resolution of such challenges.									4	0	0	1	0	4			0278-0380			WOS:000310583000002		
J	Luitel, Bipul; Venayagamoorthy, Ganesh Kumar								Decentralized Asynchronous Learning in Cellular Neural Networks								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS				23	11			1755	1766		10.1109/TNNLS.2012.2216900			NOV 2012	2012	Cellular neural networks (CNNs), as previously described, consist of identical units called cells that are connected to their adjacent neighbors. These cells interact with each other in order to fulfill a common goal. The current methods involved in learning of CNNs are usually centralized (cells are trained in one location) and synchronous (all cells are trained simultaneously either sequentially or in parallel depending on the available hardware/software platform). In this paper, a generic architecture of CNNs is presented and a special case of supervised learning is demonstrated explaining the internal components of a cell. A decentralized asynchronous learning (DAL) framework for CNNs is developed in which each cell of the CNN learns in a spatially and temporally distributed environment. An application of DAL framework is demonstrated by developing a CNN-based wide-area monitoring system for power systems. The results obtained are compared against equivalent traditional methods and shown to be better in terms of accuracy and speed.									9	0	0	1	0	9			2162-237X			WOS:000310370300007	24808070

However, the associated stress of exercise may be detrimental to reproduction. The objectives of this study were to evaluate differing exercise protocols on reproductive blood flow and embryonic outcomes in mares. Light-horse mares were randomized into control (n = 4), partial-exercised (n = 6), and full-exercised (n = 6) groups. Partial-exercised mares were moderately exercised 30 min daily during the periovulatory period and rested after ovulation for 7 d. Full-exercised mares were exercised for 30 min daily throughout the reproductive cycle. Mares were artificially inseminated during estrus and subjected to uterine flush for embryo recovery on d 7 post ovulation. Blood flow through both ovarian arteries and vascular perfusion of the wall of the preovulatory follicle were examined by color Doppler ultrasonography. Results indicated exercise induced greater serum cortisol concentrations (P < 0.05). Embryo recovery rates were reduced in exercised (20/46, 43%) compared with control (14/21, 67%) mares (P < 0.10). When examined separately, embryo recovery rates for partial-exercised (11/25, 44%) and full-exercised (9/21, 43%) mares were not significantly different. Additionally, fewer quality Grade 1 embryos were recovered from partial-exercised mares compared with both control and full-exercised mares (P < 0.05). Blood flow through both ovarian arteries was greater in both exercised groups in the days leading up to ovulation (P < 0.05). However, vascular perfusion of the wall of the preovulatory follicle on the day before ovulation was less in both partial-exercised (45.9 +/- 3.0%) and full-exercised (44.8 +/- 3.4%) mares vs. control (54.9 +/- 3.6%; P < 0.05). In exercised mares, vascular perfusion of the follicle wall was greater when an embryo was recovered (P < 0.01). No differences were found in follicle ovulatory diameter among exercised and non-exercised mares. When groups were combined, follicle diameter was greater when an embryo was recovered (44.9 +/- 1.0 mm) compared with an unsuccessful embryo recovery attempt (42.8 +/- 0.7 mm; P < 0.05). In conclusion, these data demonstrated that exercise increased ovarian arterial blood flow leading up to ovulation and decreased vascular perfusion of the wall of the preovulatory follicle. Mares given rest the day after ovulation up until an embryo collection attempt did not improve embryo recovery rates.									5	0	0	3	0	5			0021-8812	1525-3163		WOS:000311030500010	22665656

The strong localization happens near the outer boundary of the fiber and no trace of localization is observed in the central regions. However, these observations complement previous reports that the boundary of a disordered medium has a de-localizing effect. Our observations can be explained by considering the non-uniform distribution of disorder in the fiber, where the substantially larger disorder near the outer boundary of the fiber offsets the de-localizing effect of the boundary.

On loss in silicon core optical fibers								OPTICAL MATERIALS EXPRESS				2	11			1511	1519					NOV 1 2012	2012	Glass clad semiconductor core fibers have received much attention recently for their potential utility for nonlinear optics and infrared power delivery. As these fibers have progressed, it has become evident that a greater understanding as to the dominant sources of loss is needed. This work begins that discussion by investigating intrinsic and extrinsic sources of loss in silica glass clad crystalline silicon core optical fibers. Of particular interest are, to the best of our knowledge, the first lattice-fringe images of single and poly-crystalline regions of the silicon core optical fibers as well as scattering sources. Suggested herein are methods to further reduce the presence of impurities and defects that lead to scattering and dominate optical losses.

Spectral engineering of optical fiber preforms through active nanoparticle doping								OPTICAL MATERIALS EXPRESS				2	11			1520	1528					NOV 1 2012	2012	Europium doped alkaline earth fluoride [Eu:AEF(2) (AE = Ca, Sr, Ba)] nanoparticles were synthesized and systematically incorporated into the core of modified chemical vapor deposition (MCVD)-derived silica-based preforms by solution doping. The resulting preforms were examined to determine the impact of the nanoparticles chemistry on the spectroscopic behavior of the glass. The dominant existence of Eu3+ was demonstrated in all preforms, which is in contrast to conventional solution doped preforms employing dissolved europium salts where Eu2+ is primarily observed. Raman spectroscopy and fluorescence lifetime measurements indicated that the nanoparticles composition is effective in controlling, at a local chemical and structural level, the spectroscopic properties of active dopants in optical fiber glasses. Further, there is a systematic and marked increase in radiative lifetime, tau, of the Eu3+ emission that follows the cationic mass; tau(Ca) < tau(Sr) < tau(Ba) with the BaF2-derived sample yielding a 37% lengthening of the lifetime over the CaF2-derived one. Such nanoscale control of what otherwise is silica glass could be useful for realizing property-enhanced and tailored spectroscopic performance from otherwise "standard" materials, e.g., vapor-derived silica, in next generation optical fibers.

PAUL, MUKUL/C-3566-2009				Mass density and the Brillouin spectroscopy of aluminosilicate optical fibers								OPTICAL MATERIALS EXPRESS				2	11			1641	1654					NOV 1 2012	2012	Provided herein is a detailed analysis of the Brillouin properties of alumina-doped silica optical fiber. The acoustic velocity of alumina in silica is shown to be a very strong function of its mass density, which can vary significantly from sample-to-sample and likely originates from the observed linear relationship between the longitudinal elastic modulus and the mass density. Further, the refractive index versus the alumina concentration provides a very sensitive probe of this mass density, and can be used to derive other structural details about the alumina. For example, for the first time to the best of our knowledge measurements of the thermo-and strain-acoustic coefficients (TAC and SAC, respectively) of the alumina dopant in silica-based fiber are presented and it is shown that these quantities are not strongly influenced by the density of alumina. Further, the material acoustic damping does not appear to be strongly influenced by the density. The TAC and SAC, or the dependence of the acoustic velocity on temperature or strain, respectively, are both found to be negative and large for alumina, in fact much larger than those for silica. Alumina thus represents a unique and potentially very useful material for the compositional tuning of the Brillouin scattering characteristics of optical fibers for distributed sensing and other applications. Conversely, these properties of alumina reduce the effectiveness of using applied temperature or strain gradients to fiber in order to suppress Brillouin scattering in fiber laser systems.

Colleges' and universities' use of Twitter: A content analysis								PUBLIC RELATIONS REVIEW				38	4			636	638		10.1016/j.pubrev.2012.05.010			NOV 2012	2012	This study explored how colleges and universities are employing Twitter, a popular microblogging tool. Using Kent and Taylor's principles of dialogic communication, a content analysis was performed on individual tweets (n = 1130) from 113 colleges and universities. Tweets were coded for whether or not they met each principle of dialogical communication and why. It was found that institutions are not employing Twitter in a dialogic way and they are, instead, employing it primarily as an institutional news feed to a general audience. The implications of this finding are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0363-8111			WOS:000310668400016

This view is validated by a case study of behavioral intention to support conservation of Asian turtles. A total of 776 college students in China completed a questionnaire survey designed to identify factors associated with their intention to support conservation. A regression model explained 48 % of variance in the level of intention. Perceived social expectation was the strongest predictor, followed by attitudes toward turtle protection and perceived behavioral control, altogether explaining 44 %. Strong ethics and socio-economic variables had some statistical significant impacts and accounted for 3 % of the variance. The effects of general environmental awareness, trust and responsibility ascription were modest. Knowledge about turtles was a weak predictor. We conclude that perceived social expectation is a limiting factor of conservation behavior. Sustained interest and commitment to conservation can be created by enhancing positive social influences. Conservation educators should explore the potential of professionally supported, group-based actions that can nurture a sense of collective achievement as part of an educational campaign.									10	1	0	1	0	11			0364-152X			WOS:000309870100009	22961613

In the algorithm, multiphysics simulation couples multiple physical equations (e. g., the electromagnetic, semiconductor transport, thermodynamics equations, etc.) to be solved numerically by an iterative approach. The multiphysics simulation is for modeling the electrothermal behavior of semiconductor devices, and then, it is incorporated into the circuit simulation to extend the simulation from semiconductor devices to circuits. Employing the proposed algorithm, sample numerical results for the temperature effect on circuits comprising commercial p-type-intrinsic-n-type diodes with a model number of mot_bal99lt1 are obtained and compared to measurement data. The comparison shows a good agreement between these two sets of data, which validates the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can provide a useful physical mechanism for understanding temperature effect on semiconductor devices and circuits.									2	5	0	0	0	5			0018-9383			WOS:000310385100030

This study investigates the factors that influence users' intentions to continue using these websites. We adapt the theory of reasoned action and develop a model depicting how trusting beliefs, habit, attitude, and subjective norm lead to continuance intention. We propose that trusting beliefs and habit will have differential effects depending on the levels of privacy restrictiveness and site experience. An analysis of data collected from Facebook users shows that the effects of trusting beliefs on continuance intention diminish as OSN users become more experienced, yet, do not diminish when users set privacy controls high. The latter finding contradicts theory positing control and trusting beliefs are substitutes. The finding that the trusting belief-continuance intention relationship is not significant when experience is high demonstrates that trusting beliefs and experience interact. We also show that habit is a stronger predictor when users restrict their personal information. However, contrary to predictions, habit shapes intention among users with both high and low experience. These findings explain how habit and trusting beliefs predict continuance intention in the new OSN environment and have both practical and research implications.									6	1	0	0	0	6			0018-9391			WOS:000310155900014

Usually abundant of stationary and moving objects, manufacturing environments may cause transmission errors among wireless sensors due to blocking, scattering, and multipath effects. This study aims to experimentally investigate the nature of such transmission errors due to common stationary and moving obstacles in small-scale manufacturing environments inside a machine shop and with a moving forklift, respectively. The measurement study was performed using the commonly adopted IEEE 802.15.4-based 2.4 GHz Zigbee radio. The measurements show that the occurrence of transmission errors closely depends on the received signal strength in both stationary and moving settings, and the transmission errors can be mostly avoided by controlling the transmit power to assure the received signal strength above the radio receiving sensitivity level. It is also found that electromagnetic noise due to the typical machinery has negligible effects on the transmission error.									5	1	0	0	0	6			0268-3768	1433-3015		WOS:000310320800021

Performance and scaling of a novel locomotor structure: adhesive capacity of climbing gobiid fishes								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY				215	22			3925	3936		10.1242/jeb.072967			NOV 2012	2012	Many species of gobiid fishes adhere to surfaces using a sucker formed from fusion of the pelvic fins. Juveniles of many amphidromous species use this pelvic sucker to scale waterfalls during migrations to upstream habitats after an oceanic larval phase. However, adults may still use suckers to re-scale waterfalls if displaced. If attachment force is proportional to sucker area and if growth of the sucker is isometric, then increases in the forces that climbing fish must resist might outpace adhesive capacity, causing climbing performance to decline through ontogeny. To test for such trends, we measured pressure differentials and adhesive suction forces generated by the pelvic sucker across wide size ranges in six goby species, including climbing and non-climbing taxa. Suction was achieved via two distinct growth strategies: (1) small suckers with isometric (or negatively allometric) scaling among climbing gobies and (2) large suckers with positively allometric growth in non-climbing gobies. Species using the first strategy show a high baseline of adhesive capacity that may aid climbing performance throughout ontogeny, with pressure differentials and suction forces much greater than expected if adhesion were a passive function of sucker area. In contrast, large suckers possessed by non-climbing species may help compensate for reduced pressure differentials, thereby producing suction sufficient to support body weight. Climbing Sicyopterus species also use oral suckers during climbing waterfalls, and these exhibited scaling patterns similar to those for pelvic suckers. However, oral suction force was considerably lower than that for pelvic suckers, reducing the ability for these fish to attach to substrates by the oral sucker alone.									15	0	0	13	0	15			0022-0949			WOS:000310525700011	23100486

Two promising MFC PMS designs, charge pump-capacitor-converter type and capacitor-transformer-converter type, are presented and compared in their performance in driving a wireless sensing system. It is found that the capacitor-transformer-converter type PMS can accommodate lower input voltages, but the charge pump-capacitor-converter type PMS has a slightly higher power efficiency. Furthermore, the charging speed of the capacitor-transformer-converter type PMS is not limited by the charge pump as in the charge pump-capacitor-converter type PMS, resulting in a shorter charging/discharging cycle. The findings suggest that for loads with large duty cycles comparable to the charging time, the charge pump-capacitor-converter type PMS is recommended for its higher power efficiency: on the other hand, for ultra-low MFC output and/or time-sensitive missions, the capacitor-transformer-converter type PMS is recommended for its wider input voltage range and shorter charging/discharging cycle.

Michael								Simulation analysis for evacuation under congested traffic scenarios: a case study								SIMULATION-TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR MODELING AND SIMULATION INTERNATIONAL				88	11			1379	1389		10.1177/0037549712454688			NOV 2012	2012	In this paper a new simulation modeling approach to support evacuation traffic management is introduced and a case study is presented. Traditional traffic simulation models neglect some real-life factors that need to be considered in an evacuation, such as the effect of road information and active control measures to manage traffic flow while vehicles are competing to find the best or preferred route. A passive equilibrium-seeking modeling approach may not be suitable for evacuation trip analysis due to limited route capacity and likely severe congestion during an evacuation. This paper introduces a new updated cell transmission model using discrete-event simulation, which can review and analyze the preferred path of evacuation traffic from multiple starting locations (or originations) to multiple destinations. Using this approach, case studies are conducted based on the user equilibrium principle, since it represents a natural behavior in an evacuation process. This research also demonstrates that, with the help of the cell transmission simulation model, an active traffic control mechanism can be evaluated. This study found that active traffic control measures are capable of decreasing total travel time during an evacuation by thousands of vehicle hours. Incorporating behavior consideration into the evacuation planning can help form a more accurate and realistic analysis of an evacuation plan.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0037-5497			WOS:000310160200007

Assuming that lack of an understanding of the purpose of such representations inhibited students' meaningful learning, we have worked to address this "representation problem" explicitly in the context of a novel introductory general chemistry curriculum: Chemistry, Life, the Universe, and Everything (CLUE). CLUE includes a learning progression to help students master the relationships between molecular structure and bulk properties. Two methods were used to assess student learning: OrganicPad, a tablet-PC program that can recognize, record, and grade student free-form naturalistic structure drawings; and the Implicit Information from Lewis Structures Instrument (IILSI), a validated survey that asks students to identify the kinds of information they believe can be deduced from Lewis structures. A comparison of two statistically equivalent cohorts of students revealed that CLUE students show marked improvements (effect size, r = 0.6), over control students in their ability to construct structures. CLUE students were also significantly better at decoding the information that these structures contain. We present evidence that the improvements observed are due to the design and implementation of the specific learning progression rather than instructor effects.									32	0	0	1	0	32			0021-9584			WOS:000309847200003

Modifications in the AA5083 Johnson-Cook Material Model for Use in Friction Stir Welding Computational Analyses								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				21	11			2207	2217		10.1007/s11665-011-0118-7			NOV 2012	2012	Johnson-Cook strength material model is frequently used in finite-element analyses of various manufacturing processes involving plastic deformation of metallic materials. The main attraction to this model arises from its mathematical simplicity and its ability to capture the first-order metal-working effects (e.g., those associated with the influence of plastic deformation, rate of deformation, and the attendant temperature). However, this model displays serious shortcomings when used in the engineering analyses of various hot-working processes (i.e., those utilizing temperatures higher than the material recrystallization temperature). These shortcomings are related to the fact that microstructural changes involving: (i) irreversible decrease in the dislocation density due to the operation of annealing/recrystallization processes; (ii) increase in grain-size due to high-temperature exposure; and (iii) dynamic-recrystallization-induced grain refinement are not accounted for by the model. In this study, an attempt is made to combine the basic physical-metallurgy principles with the associated kinetics relations to properly modify the Johnson-Cook material model, so that the model can be used in the analyses of metal hot-working and joining processes. The model is next used to help establish relationships between process parameters, material microstructure and properties in friction stir welding welds of AA5083 (a non-age-hardenable, solid-solution strengthened, strain-hardened/stabilized Al-Mg-Mn alloy).									21	1	0	0	0	21			1059-9495			WOS:000310085800001

Fatigue-Life Computational Analysis for the Self-Expanding Endovascular Nitinol Stents								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				21	11			2218	2230		10.1007/s11665-012-0150-2			NOV 2012	2012	Self-expanding endovascular stents made of Nitinol (a Ni-Ti intermetallic compound possessing superelastic and shape-memory properties) are being widely used to treat a common circulatory problem in which narrowed arteries, primarily due to fatty deposits, hamper blood flow to the extremities (the problem commonly referred to as "peripheral artery disease"). The stents of this type unfortunately occasionally fail structurally (and, in turn, functionally) rendering the stenting procedure ineffective. The failure is most often attributed to the fatigue-induced damage since over its expected ten-year life span, the stent will normally experience 370-400 million pulsating-blood flow-induced loading cycles. Redesign/redevelopment of the stents using the conventional make-and-test approaches is quite expensive and time consuming and therefore is being increasingly complemented by computational engineering methods and tools. In the present study, advanced structural and fluid-structure interaction finite element computational methods are combined with the advanced fatigue-based durability analysis techniques to further enhance the use of the computational engineering analysis tools in the development of vascular stents with improved high-cycle fatigue life.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1059-9495			WOS:000310085800002		
J	Tufan, Hale; Zhang, Xiao-Hua; Haghshenas, Nicole; Sussman, Mark A.; Cleemann, Lars; Morad, Martin								Cardiac progenitor cells engineered with Pim-1 (CPCeP) develop cardiac phenotypic electrophysiological properties as they are co-cultured with neonatal myocytes								JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR CARDIOLOGY				53	5			695	706		10.1016/j.yjmcc.2012.08.008			NOV 2012	2012	Stem cell transplantation has been successfully used for amelioration of cardiomyopathic injury using adult cardiac progenitor cells (CPC). Engineering of mouse CPC with the human serine/threonine kinase Pim-1 (CPCeP) enhances regeneration and cell survival in vivo, but it is unknown if such apparent lineage commitment is associated with maturation of electrophysiological properties and excitation-contraction coupling. This study aims to determine electrophysiology and Ca2+-handling properties of CPCeP using neonatal rat cardiomyocyte (NRCM) co-culture to promote cardiomyocyte lineage commitment. Measurements of membrane capacitance, dye transfer, expression of connexin 43 (Cx43), and transmission of ionic currents (I-Ca, I-Na) from one cell to the next suggest that a subset of co-cultured CPCeP and NRCM becomes connected via gap junctions. Unlike NRCM, CPCeP had no significant I-Na, but expressed nifedipine-sensitive I-Ca that could be measured more consistently with Ba2+ as permeant ion using ramp-clamp protocols than with Ca2+ and step-depolarization protocols. The magnitude of I-Ca in CPCeP increased during culture (4-7 days vs. 1-3 days) and was larger in co-cultures with NRCM and with NRCM-conditioned medium, than in mono-cultured CPCeP. I-Ca was virtually absent in CPC without engineered expression of Pim-1. Caffeine and KCl-activated Ca2+-transients were significantly present in co-cultured CPCeP, but smaller than in NRCM. Conversely, ATP-induced (IP3-mediated) Ca2+ transients were larger in CPCeP than in NRCM. I-NCX and I-ATP were expressed in equivalent densities in CPCeP and NRCM. These in vitro studies suggest that CPCeP in co-culture with NRCM: a) develop I-Ca current and Ca2+ signaling consistent with cardiac lineage, b) form electrical connections via Cx43 gap junctions, and c) respond to paracrine signals from NRCM. These properties may be essential for durable and functional myocardial regeneration under in vivo conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This work describes the hydrothermal synthesis and structural characterization of three novel silicate fluorides. Compound (1), LiY3(SiO4)(2)F-2 crystallizes in space group C2/c, with a = 17.651(4) angstrom, b=4.8868(10) angstrom, c = 11.625(2) angstrom and beta = 131.13(3)degrees. BaY2(Si2O7)F-2 (2) crystallizes in space group P-1, with a=5.1576(10)angstrom, b=6.8389(14)angstrom, c=11.786(2)angstrom, alpha=93.02(3)degrees, beta=102.05(3)degrees and gamma=111.55(3)degrees. Finally, the structure of Ba2Y3(SiO4)(2)F-5 (3) was determined in the polar orthorhombic space group Pba2, having unit cell parameters a=8.8864(18) angstrom, b= 12.764(3) angstrom and c=5.0843(10) angstrom. The structures are compared based on their building blocks and long range polarities. Aligned silicate tetrahedra segregated into a single layer in (3) impart the observed polarity.

In this study, methods to distinguish both species were established and their prevalence was determined in commercial blackberry and strawberry fields. Using DNA from B. cinerea and B. caroliniana reference strains, a species-differentiating polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was developed that amplified G3PDH gene fragments of two different sizes depending on the species. The PCR is performed with three primers (two species-differentiating forward primers and one universal reverse primer) and amplified a 238-bp product from B. cinerea and a 536-bp fragment from B. caroliniana reference isolates. A total of 400 Botrytis isolates were collected from 6 commercial blackberry and 11 strawberry fields of the Carolinas and identified to the species level by the new PCR method. Both Botrytis spp. were identified in blackberry and strawberry fields, but B. caroliniana was less common than B. cinerea. Only 33 of 202 isolates from blackberry fields were identified as B. caroliniana, and the majority of these isolates came from two fields in South Carolina. Only 1 of 198 isolates from strawberries was identified as B. caroliniana, and this isolate was found in central North Carolina. B. cinerea but not B. caroliniana isolates sporulated on potato dextrose agar and Kings medium B. Our results show that B. cinerea and B. caroliniana coexist in at least some commercial blackberry and strawberry fields of the Carolinas, with B. cinerea being the more prevalent species.									5	0	0	3	0	5			0191-2917			WOS:000310040700007

Manpower systems differ primarily in how they distribute costs: the volunteer system shares the war's manpower costs broadly, whereas the draft forces a subset of the population to bear a disproportionate share of the load. This difference affects an office- and policy-motivated politician's decision to go to war. The draft induces prowar policy-makers to pursue more wars than the volunteer military does, whereas the volunteer system induces antiwar policy-makers to pursue more wars than the draft does. The manpower systems cannot be generically ranked by efficiency because each makes errors the other avoids, but the volunteer system induces selection of more efficient wars for a large class of plausible preference distributions.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0954-1985			WOS:000309911700001

Thermal Actuation Using Nanocomposites: A Computational Analysis								JOURNAL OF HEAT TRANSFER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME				134	11					112401	10.1115/1.4007128			NOV 2012	2012	In this paper, we propose the use of Si/Ge nanocomposite materials to improve the performance of microthermal actuators. Nanocomposites with a high electrical to thermal conductivity ratio can facilitate a rapid temperature change within a short distance, enabling a high temperature increase in a large region of the actuator beams. The total structural thermal expansion and, consequently, the actuation distance can be increased significantly. A top-down quasi-continuum multiscale model is presented for the computational analysis of nanocomposite based thermal actuators. In the multiscale model, the thermo-mechanical response of the actuator due to Joule heating is modeled using classical continuum theories, while the thermal and electrical properties of doped Si and Si/Ge nanocomposite materials are obtained from atomistic level descriptions. An iterative procedure is carried out between the calculations at the two length scales until a self-consistent solution is obtained. Numerical results indicate that incorporating Si/Ge nanocomposites in thermal actuators can significantly increase their energy efficiency and mechanical performance. In addition, parametric studies show that the size of the nanocomposite region and atomic percentage of the material components have significant effects on the overall performance of the actuators.

Efficiency and Incentives in Residential Brokerage								JOURNAL OF REAL ESTATE FINANCE AND ECONOMICS				45	4			1041	1061		10.1007/s11146-011-9308-1			NOV 2012	2012	The literature on broker intermediation in residential real estate has shown positive pricing effects associated with the use of a broker and mixed results as far as the pricing effects of nonstandard commission structures. On the premise that real estate broker incentives emanate from two primary sources, factors that increase broker operating efficiency and negotiable features arising from the relationship between the listing broker and the seller, this study assesses the degree to which these incentives affect the marketing time, probability of sale, and selling price of single-family houses. Of particular interest, this study investigates efficiency and broker intermediation effects on residential property associated with a broker concentrating his listings into a service area. Empirical results show that properties within an individual broker's GIS-determined service area are more likely to sell, sell faster, and sell with an associated price premium. These effects are more concentrated in the market for higher priced homes. Also, additional compensation favorably motivates the broker with higher-priced properties, but has no effect on the sale of lower-priced properties.									4	1	0	0	0	5			0895-5638			WOS:000309683500011

Through proper choice of commercially available powders, sintering conditions and stoichiometry, n-type and p-type samples with thermoelectric properties comparable with those of the Si80Ge20 alloys used in radioisotope thermoelectric generators for space missions were generated using the SE SPS process. The SE SPS technique is a rapid process requiring only 1 h to synthesize the desired material. This new synthesis technique is a viable alternative to traditional synthesis methods and provides the potential to discover novel avenues for improving the thermoelectric dimensionless figure of merit of SiGe alloys.									6	0	0	0	0	6			2046-0147	2046-0155		WOS:000209537500004

The authors assess the association between racial socialization meta-messages received during late adolescence and depressive symptoms in young adulthood. They find that a guarded racial socialization meta-message (one that combines warnings about discrimination with direction to be wary and cautious when dealing with majority group members) is associated with elevated depressive symptoms when respondents are between the ages of 20 and 22 years. The authors also find that an empowered racial socialization meta-message (one that combines warnings about discrimination with strategies for overcoming racial prejudice) partially buffers respondents against the mental health consequences of racial discrimination.									5	0	0	0	0	5			2156-8693	2156-8731		WOS:000209185100005

Two parameters, gamma and delta, were created to describe the relative adsorption affinity index of activated carbons to adsorbates and the occupancy rate of activated carbons by active sites that can lead to formation of water clusters. Taking the space availability and the relative adsorption affinity index into account, a correlation between the Freundlich adsorption affinity coefficient and the characteristics of adsorbent was established. With this correlation, if the Freundlich adsorption affinity coefficient of a compound on one carbon is known, its adsorption affinity coefficient on another carbon might be predictable if the surface chemistries and pore structures of both carbons are available.									3	0	0	2	0	3			0929-5607			WOS:000309344700007		
J	Chattaraman, Veena; Kwon, Wi-Suk; Gilbert, Juan E.								Virtual agents in retail web sites: Benefits of simulated social interaction for older users								COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR				28	6			2055	2066		10.1016/j.chb.2012.06.009			NOV 2012	2012	This study investigates the benefits of simulated social interaction (social presence) through virtual agents for older users' experience in retail Web sites, particularly with respect to age-related barriers to the adoption of online retailing. In Study 1, through four focus group interviews, we identified six social-psychological barriers to the adoption of online shopping among older users (mean age of 73 years). These included barriers relating to perceived risks, trust, social support, familiarity, experience, and search. In Study 2, a laboratory experiment with older users (mean age of 69 years) demonstrated that embedding a virtual agent that serves search and navigational/procedural support functions in the online store leads to increased perceived social support, trust, and patronage intention for the online store. Mediational analyses further revealed that the effect of virtual agents: (1) on trust is mediated by perceived social support; and (2) on patronage intentions is mediated in part by trust and perceived risks. The study provides important implications on the design of virtual agents for older users of e-commerce applications, and on building online trust and e-service patronage through virtual agents.

Parametric component detection and variable selection in varying-coefficient partially linear models								JOURNAL OF MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS				112				117	129		10.1016/j.jmva.2012.05.006			NOV 2012	2012	In this paper we are concerned with detecting the true structure of a varying-coefficient partially linear model. The first issue is to identify whether a coefficient is parametric. The second issue is to select significant covariates in both nonparametric and parametric portions. In order to simultaneously address both issues, we propose to combine local linear smoothing and the adaptive LASSO and penalize both the coefficient functions and their derivatives using an adaptive L-1 penalty. We give conditions under which this new adaptive LASSO consistently identifies the significant variables and parametric components along with estimation sparsity. Simulated and real data analysis demonstrate the proposed methodology. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.									5	1	0	0	0	5			0047-259X			WOS:000308281900009

The effects of preoxidant dose, Br-/DOC, and I-/DOC ratio were investigated. Preoxidation with KMnO4 increased I-THM formation due to an increase in iodoform (CHI3) and brominated I-THM (CHBrClI, CHBrI2, CHBr2I) formation. In contrast, preoxidation with ClO2 sometimes reduced I-THM formation, primarily due to a reduction in CHI3 formation. Preoxidation with H2O2 had no effect on I-THM formation or speciation. I-THM formation from each preoxidant alone was considerably less than the formation from NH2Cl. Overall, preoxidant type, preoxidant/DOC, preoxidant/I-, and I-/DOC ratios are the important factors that water utilities should evaluate when assessing the impact of preoxidation for controlling I-THM formation.

However, results from this study of kaolinite suspensions dosed with various anionic polyacrylamides (PAMs) reveal that Ca2+ and Mg2+ can lead to colloid stabilization under some conditions. To explain the opposite but coexisting processes of flocculation and stabilization with divalent cations, a conceptual flocculation model with (1) particle-binding divalent cationic bridges between PAM molecules and kaolinite particles and (2) polymer-binding divalent cationic bridges between PAM molecules is proposed. The particle-binding bridges enhanced flocculation and aggregated kaolinite particles in large, easily-settleable flocs whereas the polymer-binding bridges increased steric stabilization by developing polymer layers covering the kaolinite surface. Both the particle-binding and polymer-binding divalent cationic bridges coexist in anionic PAM- and kaolinite-containing suspensions and thus induce the counteracting processes of particle flocculation and stabilization. Therefore, anionic polyelectrolytes in divalent cation-enriched aqueous solutions can sometimes lead to the stabilization of colloidal particles due to the polymer-binding divalent cationic bridges.

FOOD CHEMISTRY				135	1			199	207		10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.04.067			NOV 1 2012	2012	Devil's club (Oplopanax horridus (Sm.) Miq.) has traditionally been used as a folk medicine by native North Americans for the treatment of various chronic diseases. A methanolic extract and its sub-fractions by liquid-liquid re-extraction, i.e., chloroform (CHCl3), ethyl acetate (EtOAc). n-butanol (BuOH), and water fractions, were analysed by their anti-cancer activity with in vitro cell proliferative bioassays, and their antioxidant capacities in terms of the determination of total phenolic content (TPC), ORAC value, and DPPH free radical scavenging activity. The whole extract of the dried root contained high TPC and possessed strong ORAC and DPPH radical scavenging activities. In addition, the extract exhibited a strong anti-proliferative ability against HT-29 cancer cells, e.g., with an inhibitive rate of 56.5% with a 0.2-mg/mL extract. Further investigation by HPLC-UV-MS identified significant bioactive phenolic compounds in the chloroform fraction, including gallic acid, caffeic acid, 4-0-feruloylquinic acid, 5-O-feruloylquinic acid, ferulic acid, methyl feruloylquinate, methyl ferulate, and quercetin. These results suggested that the associated bioactivity of the plant might result from the contribution of phenolic compounds. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Rotational alignment in the transverse plane has proven particularly problematic, with errors due to component malalignment relative to bone anatomic landmarks and an overall mismatch between the femoral and tibial components' relative positions. Ranges of nominal rotational alignment are not well defined, especially for the tibial component and for relative rotational mismatch, and some studies advocate the use of mobile-bearing TKR to accommodate the resulting small rotation errors. However, the relationships between prosthesis rotational alignment and mobile-bearing polyethylene insert motion are poorly understood. This prospective, in vivo study evaluates whether component malalignment and mismatch affect axial rotation motions during passive knee flexion after TKR.Methods: Eighty patients were implanted with mobile-bearing TKR. Rotational alignment of the femoral and tibial components was measured from postoperative CT scans. All TKR were categorized into nominal or outlier groups based on defined norms for surgical rotational alignment relative to bone anatomic landmarks and relative rotational mismatch between the femoral and tibial components. Axial rotation motion of the femoral, tibial and polyethylene bearing components was measured from fluoroscopic images acquired during passive knee flexion.Results: Axial rotation motion was generally accomplished in two phases, dominated by polyethylene bearing rotation on the tibial component in early to mid-flexion and then femoral component rotation on the polyethylene articular surface in later flexion. Opposite rotations of the femur-bearing and bearing-baseplate articulations were evident at flexion greater than 80. Knees with outlier alignment had lower magnitudes of axial rotation and distinct transitions from external to internal rotation during mid-flexion. Knees with femoral-tibial rotational mismatch had significantly lower total axial rotation compared to knees with nominal alignment. Conclusions: Maintaining relative rotational mismatch within +/- 5 degrees during TKR provided for controlled knee axial rotation during flexion. TKR with rotational alignment outside of defined surgical norms, with either positive or negative mismatch, experienced measurable kinematic differences and presented different patterns of axial rotation motions during passive knee flexion compared to TKR with nominal mismatch. These findings support previous studies linking prosthesis rotational alignment with inferior clinical and functional outcomes.Trial Registration: Clinical Trials NCT01022099									11	0	0	1	0	11			1471-2474			WOS:000315122700001	23088451

The plasma array device consisted of a central glass tube encircled by an array of hollow glass tubes. A single plasma jet was induced via jet-to-jet coupling and enabled significantly increased plasma emission despite a negligible change in power consumption. An increase in the number of outer tubes yielded a greater number of charged particles involved in the plasma process and resulting in the achievement of higher plasma emission in the coupled system.

Subcritical clusters of water and methane molecules are formed in the initial segment of the simulations, which then aggregate to give the critical hydrate nucleus. This occurs over time scales of several hundred nanoseconds, indicating that the formation and aggregation of subcritical clusters can contribute significantly to the overall rate of hydrate nucleation. The clusters have elements of sI hydrate structure, such as 5(12) and 5(12)6(2) cages as well as other uncommon 5(12)6(3) and 5(12)6(4) cages, but do not possess long-range order. Clusters are dynamic in nature and undergo continuous structural rearrangements.									53	0	0	4	1	53			1948-7185			WOS:000310177200004	26292230

However, the main physical mechanisms that elicit protein conformational changes in the presence of the nanostructure have not yet been fully established. Here we performed a comprehensive spectroscopic study to probe the interactions between bovine serum albumin (BSA) and carbon-based nanostructures of graphene and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). Our results showed that the BSA "corona" acted as a weak acceptor to facilitate charge transfer from the carbon nanostructures. Notably, we observed that charge transfer occurred only in the case of SWNTs but not in graphene, resulting from the sharp and discrete electronic density of states of the former. Furthermore, the relaxation of external a-helices in. BSA secondary structure increased concomitantly with the charge transfer. These results may help guide controlled nanostructure-biomolecular interactions and prove beneficial for developing novel drug delivery systems, biomedical devices, and engineering of safe nano materials.									18	0	0	4	0	18			1932-7447			WOS:000309902100058	23243478

We developed a mathematical model to compare different liposome formulations of doxorubicin (DOX): conventional chemotherapy (Free-DOX), Stealth liposomes (Stealth-DOX), temperature sensitive liposomes (TSL) with intra-vascular triggered release (TSL-i), and TSL with extra-vascular triggered release (TSL-e). All formulations were administered as bolus at a dose of 9 mg/kg. For TSL, we assumed locally triggered release due to hyperthermia for 30 min. Drug concentrations were determined in systemic plasma, aggregate body tissue, cardiac tissue, tumor plasma, tumor interstitial space, and tumor cells. All compartments were assumed perfectly mixed, and represented by ordinary differential equations. Contribution of liposomal extravasation was negligible in the case of TSL-i, but was the major delivery mechanism for Stealth-DOX and for TSL-e. The dominant delivery mechanism for TSL-i was release within the tumor plasma compartment with subsequent tissue-and cell uptake of released DOX. Maximum intracellular tumor drug concentrations for Free-DOX, Stealth-DOX, TSL-i, and TSL-e were 3.4, 0.4, 100.6, and 15.9 mu g/g, respectively. TSL-i and TSL-e allowed for high local tumor drug concentrations with reduced systemic exposure compared to Free-DOX. While Stealth-DOX resulted in high tumor tissue concentrations compared to Free-DOX, only a small fraction was bioavailable, resulting in little cellular uptake. Consistent with clinical data, Stealth-DOX resulted in similar tumor intracellular concentrations as Free-DOX, but with reduced systemic exposure. Optimal release time constants for maximum cellular uptake for Stealth-DOX, TSL-e, and TSL-i were 45 min, 11 min, and <3 s, respectively. Optimal release time constants were shorter for MDR cells, with similar to 4 min for Stealth-DOX and for TSL-e. Tissue concentrations correlated well quantitatively with a prior in-vivo study. Mathematical models may thus allow optimization of drug delivery systems to achieve a better therapeutic index.									22	0	0	21	0	22			1932-6203			WOS:000311146900064	23082168

However, their utilization has raised concerns about human exposure that may predispose individuals to adverse health risks. The present study investigated the susceptibility to cardiac ischemic injury following a single exposure to various forms of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). It was hypothesized that oropharyngeal aspiration of MWCNTs exacerbates myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury (I/R injury).Methods: Oropharyngeal aspiration was performed on male C57BL/6J mice with a single amount of MWCNT (0.01 - 100 mu g) suspended in 100 mu L of a surfactant saline (SS) solution. Three forms of MWCNTs were used in this study: unmodified, commercial grade (C-grade), and functionalized forms that were modified either by acid treatment (carboxylated, COOH) or nitrogenation (N-doped) and a SS vehicle. The pulmonary inflammation, serum cytokine profile and cardiac ischemic/reperfusion (I/R) injury were assessed at 1, 7 and 28 days post-aspiration.Results: Pulmonary response to MWCNT oropharyngeal aspiration assessed by bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) revealed modest increases in protein and inflammatory cell recruitment. Lung histology showed modest tissue inflammation as compared to the SS group. Serum levels of eotaxin were significantly elevated in the carboxylated MWCNT aspirated mice 1 day post exposure. Oropharyngeal aspiration of all three forms of MWCNTs resulted in a time and/or dose-dependent exacerbation of myocardial infarction. The severity of myocardial injury varied with the form of MWCNTs used. The N-doped MWCNT produced the greatest expansion of the infarct at any time point and required a log concentration lower to establish a no effect level. The expansion of the I/R injury remained significantly elevated at 28 days following aspiration of the COOH and N-doped forms, but not the C-grade as compared to SS.Conclusion: Our results suggest that oropharyngeal aspiration of MWCNT promotes increased susceptibility of cardiac tissue to ischemia/reperfusion injury without a significant pulmonary inflammatory response. The cardiac injury effects were observed at low concentrations of MWCNTs and presence of MWCNTs may pose a significant risk to the cardiovascular system.									20	0	0	15	0	20			1743-8977			WOS:000312258900001	23072542

Chirality effect is more significant in the mechanical properties of silicene than those of silicane. Different failure mechanisms are identified. A small band gap (up to 0.8 eV) is developed from zero with silicene structure under uniaxial tension and vanishes before the structure reaches its in-plane ultimate strength. However, a pre-existing band gap (2.39 eV) exists with silicane structure and decreases to zero with the increasing tensile strain without chirality effects. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Their thermoelectric properties were evaluated from 300 to 820 K. The Yb filling fraction increased with Fe content while the amount of Fe substitution had little influence on the Ba filling fraction. High purity specimens were obtained when the Fe content was low. Bipolar conduction contributed to the thermal conductivity at elevated temperatures. A maximum ZT value of 0.7 was obtained at 750 K for the specimen with the highest Fe content and filling fraction. The potential for thermoelectric applications is also discussed. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4759370]									9	0	0	0	0	9			0021-8979			WOS:000310597500062

It is important to investigate the jet and droplet formation process under different LIFT operating conditions. The resulting knowledge will help to better control the resulting printing quality and feature resolution. This study aims to better understand the effects of fluid properties and laser fluence on the jet formation process using time resolved imaging analysis during LIFT of glycerol solutions. It is found that if the laser fluence is too low and/or the glycerol concentration is too high, it is less likely for a bubble to fully form and/or grow before it diminishes. If the laser fluence is too high and/or the glycerol concentration is too low, it is also difficult to form a well-developed jet since dramatic bubble expansion may lead to a bulgy shape and even splashing. Only under certain combinations of glycerol concentration and laser fluence, can a well-defined jet form. When a jetting fluid is given, its jettability (J) can be characterized as the inverse of the Ohnesorge number. It is observed that a good jet forms at 0.86 <= J <= 2.49 (corresponding to 75%-85% glycerol solutions) when the laser fluence is 717 +/- 45 mJ/cm(2). (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

However, variation in land use within organic systems limits absolute statements about its value for species conservation. Thus, a need is evident to better understand what practices associated with organic farming benefit conservation. We modeled abundance, within organic systems, of six grassland birds of conservation concern as an outcome of applied wildlife-friendly and land sparing practices at multiple spatial scales. We used a Poisson-binomial model to estimate the relative effect of abundance drivers while accounting for detectability. At the field scale, species response to vegetation structure was mixed. At a local scale, Dickcissels were more abundant at points with greater percentage of alfalfa and soybean. Three species were less abundant at points with a greater percent of local woodland and there was no significant response to local linear grass. Grasshopper Sparrows were more abundant at points with more local block grassland. At a landscape scale, Western Meadowlarks and Ring-necked Pheasants were more abundant at points with a greater percent of grassland in the landscape. Results highlight the importance of a multiscale approach and demonstrate that effective management of species should consider costs and benefits of wildlife-friendly and land sparing practices.

In a 3-year study on moderately well- to well-drained soils of the Lower Coastal Plain in North Carolina, we examined the effects of four canopy and three cultural treatments on plant resources and quantified relationships between plant resources and longleaf pine seedling survival and growth. Canopy treatments consisted of four levels of timber harvest applied to loblolly pine stands: Control (uncut, mean basal area of 16.2 m(2)/ha), MedBA (single-tree selection to a mean residual basal area of 9.0 m(2)/ha), LowBA (single-tree selection to a mean residual basal area of 6.4 m(2)/ha), and Clearcut (complete canopy removal). Within each canopy treatment, we applied three cultural treatments designed to benefit the early growth of planted seedlings: no treatment (NT), herbicide (H), and herbicide plus fertilization (H + F). Gap light index (GLI) significantly differed among canopy treatments and nonlinearly increased with decreasing basal area. The H treatment resulted in higher temperatures at 10 cm in the soil. Canopy thinning increased foliar calcium (Ca) concentration. The annual root collar diameter (RCD) increment of planted longleaf pine seedlings was positively correlated with GLI, and foliar phosphorus (P) and Ca concentrations but was negatively correlated with soil moisture. Our results confirm that light is an important factor controlling the growth of longleaf pine seedlings. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

An X-linked channelopathy with cardiomegaly due to a CLIC2 mutation enhancing ryanodine receptor channel activity								HUMAN MOLECULAR GENETICS				21	20			4497	4507		10.1093/hmg/dds292			OCT 15 2012	2012	Chloride intracellular channel 2 (CLIC2) protein is a member of the glutathione transferase class of proteins. Its only known function is the regulation of ryanodine receptor (RyR) intracellular Ca-2 release channels. These RyR proteins play a major role in the regulation of Ca-2 signaling in many cells. Utilizing exome capture and deep sequencing of genes on the X-chromosome, we have identified a mutation in CLIC2 (c.303CG, p.H101Q) which is associated with X-linked intellectual disability (ID), atrial fibrillation, cardiomegaly, congestive heart failure (CHF), some somatic features and seizures. Functional studies of the H101Q variant indicated that it stimulated rather than inhibited the action of RyR channels, with channels remaining open for longer times and potentially amplifying Ca-2 signals dependent on RyR channel activity. The overly active RyRs in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells and neuronal cells would result in abnormal cardiac function and trigger post-synaptic pathways and neurotransmitter release. The presence of both cardiomegaly and CHF in the two affected males and atrial fibrillation in one are consistent with abnormal RyR2 channel function. Since the dysfunction of RyR2 channels in the brain via oleaky mutations' can result in mild developmental delay and seizures, our data also suggest a vital role for the CLIC2 protein in maintaining normal cognitive function via its interaction with RyRs in the brain. Therefore, our patients appear to suffer from a new channelopathy comprised of ID, seizures and cardiac problems because of enhanced Ca-2 release through RyRs in neuronal cells and cardiac muscle cells.									26	1	0	22	0	28			0964-6906			WOS:000309460300011	22814392

Topological Invariants for Spin-Orbit Coupled Superconductor Nanowires								PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS				109	15					150408	10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.150408			OCT 10 2012	2012	We show that the Hamiltonian of a multiband spin-orbit coupled semiconductor nanowire with Zeeman splitting and s-wave superconductivity is approximately chiral symmetric. The chiral symmetry becomes exact when only one pair of confinement bands is occupied and the Zeeman splitting is parallel to the nanowire. In this idealized case the Hamiltonian is in the BDI symmetry class of the topological classification of band Hamiltonians, allowing an arbitrary integer number of zero-energy Majorana fermion modes at each end. In the realistic case of multiband wires (Zeeman splitting still parallel to the length) the chiral symmetry is approximate and results in multiple near-zero-energy end states with increasing Zeeman splitting. The existence of such low energy end states implies the vanishing of the minigap with increased Zeeman splitting which can only be restored by breaking the approximate chiral symmetry by a second Zeeman field.									102	2	0	2	0	102			0031-9007			WOS:000309658300002	23102284

A multiscale component mode synthesis approach for dynamic analysis of nanostructures								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL METHODS IN ENGINEERING				92	1			79	98		10.1002/nme.4330			OCT 5 2012	2012	A component mode synthesis-based multiscale approach is developed for dynamic analysis of nanostructures. The multiscale approach decomposes a nanostructure into atomistic and continuum regions and employs vibrational modes to connect the regions of different scales, enabling a reflectionless atomistic-to-continuum coupling. Dynamic response of the coupled atomistic and continuum regions is computed concurrently using a common time scale. Numerical results indicate that the multiscale approach has significant condensation and scaling advantages, and it is well suited for modeling and simulation of large and complex systems.

Here we report the sequencing and assembly of the oyster genome using short reads and a fosmid-pooling strategy, along with transcriptomes of development and stress response and the proteome of the shell. The oyster genome is highly polymorphic and rich in repetitive sequences, with some transposable elements still actively shaping variation. Transcriptome studies reveal an extensive set of genes responding to environmental stress. The expansion of genes coding for heat shock protein 70 and inhibitors of apoptosis is probably central to the oyster's adaptation to sessile life in the highly stressful intertidal zone. Our analyses also show that shell formation in molluscs is more complex than currently understood and involves extensive participation of cells and their exosomes. The oyster genome sequence fills a void in our understanding of the Lophotrochozoa.									535	47	0	505	1	576			0028-0836			WOS:000309446800030	22992520

The materials retain structural integrity following cleaning and ion-exchange steps in boiling solutions, similar to a commercial fuel cell membrane. Unlike commercial membrane, which typically has thicknesses of >25 mu m, the structural properties of the submicrometer thickness materials can be probed in mid-infrared spectral measurements with the use of transmission sampling. Relative to the infrared attenuated total reflection (ATR) technique, transmission measurements can sample ionomer membrane materials more uniformly and suffer less distortion from optical effects. Spectra are reported for thermally processed Nafion and related perfluoroalkyl ionomer materials containing phosphonate and phosphinate moieties substituted for the sulfonate end group on the side chain. Band assignments for complex or unexpected features are aided by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0003-2700			WOS:000309493200009	22947127

Although the potential side effects of steroids are relatively well known, problems with counterfeit substances and steroid-spiked dietary supplements have received less attention.

Process Modeling of Ti-6Al-4V Linear Friction Welding (LFW)								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				21	10			2011	2023		10.1007/s11665-011-0097-8			OCT 2012	2012	A fully coupled thermomechanical finite-element analysis of the linear friction welding (LFW) process is combined with the basic physical metallurgy of Ti-6Al-4V to predict microstructure and mechanical properties within the LFW joints (as a function of the LFW process parameters). A close examination of the experimental results reported in the open literature revealed that the weld region consists of a thermomechanically affected zone (TMAZ) and a heat-affected zone (HAZ) and that the material mechanical properties are somewhat more inferior in the HAZ. Taking this observation into account, a model for microstructure-evolution during LFW was developed and parameterized for the Ti-6Al-4V material residing in the HAZ. Specifically, this model addresses the problem of temporal evolution of the prior beta-phase grain size (the dominant microstructural parameter in the HAZ) during the LFW process. This model is next combined with the well-established property versus microstructure correlations in Ti-6Al-4V to predict the overall structural performance of the LFW joint. The results obtained are found to be in reasonably good agreement with their experimental counterparts suggesting that the present computational approach may be used to guide the selection of the LFW process parameters to optimize the structural performance of the LFW joints.									10	1	0	0	0	10			1059-9495			WOS:000309103200001

Liquid-liquid equilibrium tie-line compositions at elevated temperatures and pressures for the I-2-H2O and HI-I-2-H2O systems of the Sulfur-Iodine Cycle								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYDROGEN ENERGY				37	20			15020	15028		10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.08.005			OCT 2012	2012	Liquid-liquid equilibrium (LLE) tie-line compositions were measured for the binary system iodine-water and the ternary system hydrogen iodide-iodine-water (HI-I-2-H2O) at 199.1 and 252.2 degrees C, at pressures of 60 bar, conditions of interest for the reactive distillation column of the Sulfur-Iodine Cycle. To keep the HI decomposition reaction negligible, a continuous-flow apparatus was used to minimize residence times at the elevated temperatures. Sixteen equilibrium tie lines were measured, using overall feed compositions ranging from 0.0 to 3.3 mol % HI, and the plait-point composition for 199.1 degrees C was estimated. Sample compositions for the lighter, water-rich phase and the heavier, I-2-rich phase were both determined via titration of HI and I-2, with water being obtained by difference. The phase behavior indicates that the selectivity of HI for the aqueous phase can be large, ranging from 10 to 100+ for tie lines removed from the critical region.

Uptake, distribution, and velocity of organically complexed plutonium in corn (Zea mays)								JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RADIOACTIVITY				112				133	140		10.1016/j.jenvrad.2012.05.017			OCT 2012	2012	Lysimeter experiments and associated simulations suggested that Pu moved into and through plants that invaded field lysimeters during an 11-year study at the Savannah River Site. However, probable plant uptake and transport mechanisms were not well defined, so more detailed study is needed. Therefore, experiments were performed to examine movement, distribution, and velocity of soluble, complexed Pu in corn. Corn was grown and exposed to Pu using a "long root" system in which the primary root extended through a soil pot and into a hydroponic container. To maintain solubility, Pu was complexed with the bacterial siderophore DFOB (Desferrioxamine B) or the chelating agent DTPA (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid). Corn plants were exposed to nutrient solutions containing Pu for periods of 10 min to 10 d. Analysis of root and shoot tissues permitted concentration measurement and calculation of uptake velocity and Pu retardation in corn. Results showed that depending on exposure time, 98.3-95.9% of Pu entering the plant was retained in the roots external to the xylem, and that 1.7-4.1% of Pu entered the shoots (shoot fraction increased with exposure time). Corn Pu uptake was 2-4 times greater as Pu(DFOB) than as Pu-2(DTPA)(3). Pu(DFOB) solution entered the root xylem and moved 1.74 m h(-1) or greater upward, which is more than a million times faster than Pu(III/IV) downward movement through soil during the lysimeter study. The Pu(DFOB) xylem retardation factor was estimated to be 3.7-11, allowing for rapid upward Pu transport and potential environmental release. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Novel Pyrophosphate-Forming Acetate Kinase from the Protist Entamoeba histolytica								EUKARYOTIC CELL				11	10			1249	1256		10.1128/EC.00169-12			OCT 2012	2012	Acetate kinase (ACK) catalyzes the reversible synthesis of acetyl phosphate by transfer of the gamma-phosphate of ATP to acetate. Here we report the first biochemical and kinetic characterization of a eukaryotic ACK, that from the protist Entamoeba histolytica. Our characterization revealed that this protist ACK is the only known member of the ASKHA structural superfamily, which includes acetate kinase, hexokinase, and other sugar kinases, to utilize inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi)/inorganic phosphate (P-i) as the sole phosphoryl donor/acceptor. Detection of ACK activity in E. histolytica cell extracts in the direction of acetate/PPi formation but not in the direction of acetyl phosphate/P-i formation suggests that the physiological direction of the reaction is toward acetate/PPi production. Kinetic parameters determined for each direction of the reaction are consistent with this observation. The E. histolytica PPi-forming ACK follows a sequential mechanism, supporting a direct in-line phosphoryl transfer mechanism as previously reported for the well-characterized Methanosarcina thermophila ATP-dependent ACK. Characterizations of enzyme variants altered in the putative acetate/acetyl phosphate binding pocket suggested that acetyl phosphate binding is not mediated solely through a hydrophobic interaction but also through the phosphoryl group, as for the M. thermophila ACK. However, there are key differences in the roles of certain active site residues between the two enzymes. The absence of known ACK partner enzymes raises the possibility that ACK is part of a novel pathway in Entamoeba.									5	0	0	6	0	6			1535-9778			WOS:000309524800008	22903977

Display configurations in a small footprint clinical driving simulator								DISPLAYS				33	4-5	SI		196	205		10.1016/j.displa.2012.05.002			OCT 2012	2012	Particularly in the health and rehabilitation sector where cost and space are constraints, clinicians need smaller driving simulators. Because of the limited projected field of view (PFOV) afforded by these displays, it was desirable to extend the virtual or geometric field of view (GFOV) beyond that natively afforded by the PFOV. In Study I, user feedback was gathered from our target user population on two display configurations: (1) a single large LCD; and (2) three smaller LCD screens. Participants were also exposed to four GFOV settings (65 degrees, 80 degrees, 95 degrees, 110 degrees) using either display. The majority of participants preferred and were most comfortable with the three-screen configuration with the highest GFOV setting tested (110 degrees). In order for driving simulation to produce realistic experiences, drivers' perception of speed should correspond with real world experiences. However, changing the PFOV/GFOV ratio has been shown to alter perceived speed. Therefore, the purpose of Study 2 was to better understand the relationship between speed perception and the GFOV/PFOV ratio in a way that would be useful to simulation practitioners using a small-footprint driving simulator. Using the DriveSafety CDS-250, participants performed a speed matching task using six different GFOV conditions while the PFOV was held constant. Target speeds were presented in three appropriate simulated environments: 25 mph in a residential area, 45 mph in a commercial area, and 65 mph on a freeway. In general, perceived speed was found to decrease with larger GFOVs. However, no GFOV tested produced accurate speed perception; on average, all participants underestimated their speeds using all GFOVs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

An optical vortex phase element was fabricated, using additive lithography, with an optimized process to achieve minimal surface roughness. Shipley S1827 photoresist was used in order to obtain the appropriate additive lithography dynamic range for the desired phase profile. We investigated the effects of both postapplied and postexposure baking processes, bias exposure dose, as well as the effects of surfactant in the developer. We found the resist surface roughness to be a function of both the temperature and the time of the postapplication baking cycles, as well as the developer surfactant content. Based on our findings, an empirical correlation model was constructed to relate the process parameters with surface roughness measured quantities. The maximum roughness of the optical surface, for the optimized process, was reduced to 40 percent of the value for the unoptimized process and the additive lithography useful exposure range was increased by 10 percent.

The assessment is based on a review of 51 sites of conspicuous craterlets and horizontal ground displacement that occurred in beach sand deposits during the 1886 Charleston earthquake and an analysis of 82 seismic cone penetration tests with pore-pressure measurements. Of the 51 ground failure sites, 23 are associated with the Ten Mile Hill beds; 13 with the Wando Formation; 13 with the Silver Bluff terrace and younger deposits that lie adjacent to the harbor, rivers, and creeks; and two with the Ladson Formation. Liquefaction potential is analyzed using the seismic cone data with and without correction for age-related processes (diagenesis) and then expressed in terms of the liquefaction potential index (LPI). Probability curves are developed from the LPI calculations for different earthquake ground-shaking parameters. The probability curves for the Wando Formation overpredict liquefaction potential when no corrections for diagenesis are made. When corrections for diagenesis are made, the probability curves for all four sands generally agree with the observed field behavior. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)GT.1943-5606.0000686.

The objective of this paper is to experimentally investigate and validate this assessment methodology using the wear results from a series of controlled machining experiments on grade-5 titanium alloy. The traditionally difficult-to-machine alloy, Ti-6Al-4V, was specifically chosen as the work material in order to highlight how the use of this assessment methodology is necessitated especially because of (i) the pronounced complexities in the geometric profiles of typical cutting tools employed for machining Ti-6Al-4V and (ii) its nonconformity in behavior with standard tool wear models, such as the Taylor's tool life model and its extensions. This assessment methodology is then validated through the simultaneous analysis and comparison of traditional flank wear and associated photomicrographs with volumetric wear and its evolution. Furthermore, the concept of the M-ratio and its derivatives are developed to quantify the efficiency of the cutting tool during each pass at a constant material removal rate (MRR).

Traditional parameters used for tool wear representation such as flank and crater wear are no longer self-sufficient to satisfactorily represent the advanced wear status of more recent cutting tools with complex geometric profiles. These complexities in tool geometries are all the more pronounced when catered to difficult-to-machine materials such as titanium and its alloys. Hence, alternatives to traditional tool wear assessment parameters are briefly explored and a suitable one is selected, that will help understand the very nature of the evolving wear profile itself from a three dimensional standpoint. The assessment methodology is further developed and standardized and suggestions for future use and deployment are provided. The measurement system is evaluated using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) gauge repeatability and reproducibility (R&R) study as well. In Part 2 of this paper, this method is deployed for assessing tool wear in machining Ti-6Al-4 V and concepts such as the M-ratio and its derivatives are developed to quantify the efficiency of the cutting tool during each pass.

Optical emission spectrometry was applied to study the characteristics of the oxygen plasma, and the effects of the radio frequency power on the properties of the ZnO thin films were evaluated by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and photoluminescence. The grain sizes for radio frequency powers of 100, 200, and 300W were 46, 48, and 62 nm, respectively. In addition, the photoluminescence intensities of the ultraviolet and the visible range increased at 300W, because the density of the atomic oxygen transitions increased. The quality of the ZnO thin films was enhanced, but the deep-level emission peaks increased with increasing radio frequency power. The structural and optical properties of the ZnO thin films were improved at the radio frequency power of 300W. Moreover, the optical properties of the ZnO thin films were improved with porous silicon, instead of Si. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This configuration utilizes a 180 degrees geometry, which is different from the 40 degrees geometry that was used to ionize ablated particles followed by mass spectrometric detection. The use of a hollow counter electrode (nickel, 0.3 cm o.d., 0.1 cm id.) was implemented to introduce ablated particles directly into the APGD plasma with helium as a carrier gas. The LS-APGD source was optimized using ablated copper as the test sample (helium carrier gas flow rate (0.30 L min(-1) He), discharge current (60 mA), laser power (44 mJ), and solution electrode sheath gas (0.2 L min(-1) He) and solution flow rates (10 mu L min(-1) 5% HNO3)). Standard brass samples having known Zn/Cu percentages were ablated and analyzed using the LS-APGD source. As a comparison, the established technique of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) was used to analyze the same set of brass standards under similar ablation conditions to the LS-AGPD measurements, yielding comparable results. The Zn/Cu ratio results for the LS-APGD and LIBS measurements showed good similarity to previous measurements using ICP-MS detection. The performance of the LS-APGD-OES microplasma, comparable to well established methods, with lower capital and operational overhead expenses, suggests a great deal of promise as an analytical excitation source.

Bruce								Improved methods for axenic culture of Labyrinthula terrestris, causal agent of rapid blight of turfgrasses								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY				58	10			1230	1235		10.1139/W2012-096			OCT 2012	2012	The genus Labyrinthula is a group of unicellular microorganisms with spindle-shaped cells that move in an ectoplasmic network. Most Labyrinthula species are saprotrophic and found in coastal marine or estuarine habitats; however, exceptions exist, such as Labyrinthula terrestris, a terrestrial plant pathogen that causes rapid blight on cool-season turfgrasses. Labyrinthula spp. can be grown in culture, which facilitates studies on their biology and pathology. However, axenic culture of L. terrestris has always been challenging. We modified the most commonly used Labyrinthula growth medium, serum seawater agar (SSA), and designed 2 media for improved pure culture, modified SSA (MSSA) and grass extract SSA (GESSA). A comparative assessment of these 2 media and basic SSA was made to measure the growth responses of 18 L. terrestris isolates. Results indicate that the average colony area was greatest on GESSA followed by MSSA, while cultures lived longest on MSSA followed by GESSA. We also suggest an improved long-term culture technique to maintain viable L. terrestris isolates for at least 2 years.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0008-4166			WOS:000310451700010	22971235

The latter were characterized by using multiple methods, including elemental analysis, X-ray crystallography, NMR and/or EPR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and IR spectroscopy. Compounds 14 serve as catalysts for the photoinduced reactivity of 3-hydroxyflavonol (3-HflH) to produce O-benzoylsalicylic acid as the major product. Spectroscopic studies (UV/Vis and 1H NMR) show that each O-benzoylsalicylato complex 811 reacts with one equiv. of 3-hydroxyflavonol to regenerate 14 and enable turnover reactivity. Unlike what is observed for free 3-HflH, photoinduced reactions involving 14 and excess flavonol show only minor amounts of flavonol isomerization reactivity. These results indicate that the presence of a metal ion, whether under stoichiometric or catalytic conditions, facilitates the photoinduced degradation of 3-HflH to produce a carboxylic acid and CO as products.									9	0	0	2	0	9			1434-1948			WOS:000309467600026

This paper presents an automated approach for early detection of MCI through pattern classification of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. The approach is based on image feature selection and support vector machine (SVM) classification. Subjects were selected from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) database and included 89 MCI subjects and 80 controls. Voxel-by-voxel differences in gray matter (GM) intensity between the MCI and control groups were identified. Then regions of interest (ROIs) and the most discriminative image features that represented the patterns in MCI subjects were determined for training a classifier. The classifier demonstrated a high classification accuracy (90%) when a behavioral estimate of MCI and the ROIs were included as features in comparison to the behavioral estimate or the ROIs alone, which is one scientific contribution of our work. Another contribution is that the classifier can be integrated with the image processing functions through an online interface with significant medical capability that can be used for automated image pre-processing, obtaining MCI probability estimates for individual cases, and visualization of affected regions.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0218-2130			WOS:000310637200004

Variation in catchment areas of Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis) hibernacula inferred from stable hydrogen (delta H-2) isotope analysis								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY				90	10			1243	1250		10.1139/Z2012-093			OCT 2012	2012	Understanding seasonal movements of bats is important for effective conservation efforts. Although female Indiana bats (Myotis sodalis Miller and Allen, 1928) have been documented to migrate >500 km, knowledge of their migratory patterns is still extremely limited. We used the relationship between latitude and stable hydrogen isotope ratio in bat hair (delta H-2(hair)) to estimate the north south extent of the summer range (catchment area) of bats hibernating in 14 Indiana bat hibernacula in eight states throughout its range. Range of delta H-2(hair) values varied substantially among hibernacula, suggesting large differences among sites in the north south distance travelled by bats between summer and winter habitats. In particular, hibernacula in the southern portion of the range had greater catchment areas than those in the central and northern portions of the range. Variability in movement distances among sites was not associated with the number of hair samples analyzed or colony size. Significant year-to-year variation (2007-2008 to 2008-2009) in the distribution of delta H-2(hair) for two sites in Tennessee was observed. Currently, hibernacula considered important for species conservation are largely determined by population size, but our results suggest that migratory diversity should also be considered.									7	0	0	6	0	7			0008-4301	1480-3283		WOS:000310859700005

Choline Supplementation and DNA Methylation in the Hippocampus and Prefrontal Cortex of Rats Exposed to Alcohol During Development								ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH				36	10			1701	1709		10.1111/j.1530-0277.2012.01784.x			OCT 2012	2012	Background Some of the most frequent deficits seen in children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and in animal models of FASD are spatial memory impairments and impaired executive functioning, which are likely related to alcohol-induced alterations of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC), respectively. Choline, a nutrient supplement, has been shown in a rat model to ameliorate some of alcohol's teratogenic effects, and this effect may be mediated through choline's effects on DNA methylation. Methods Alcohol was given by intragastric intubation to rat pups during the neonatal period (postnatal days 2 to 10) (ET group), which is equivalent to the third trimester in humans and a period of heightened vulnerability of the brain to alcohol exposure. Control groups included an intubated control group given the intubation procedure without alcohol (IC) and a nontreated control group (NC). Choline or saline was administered subcutaneously to each subject from postnatal days 2 to 20. On postnatal day 21, the brains of the subjects were removed and assayed for global DNA methylation patterning as measured by chemiluminescence using the cpGlobal assay in both the hippocampal region and PFC. Results Alcohol exposure caused hypermethylation in the hippocampus and PFC, which was significantly reduced after choline supplementation. In contrast, control animals showed increases in DNA methylation in both regions after choline supplementation, suggesting that choline supplementation has different effects depending upon the initial state of the brain. Conclusions This study is the first to show changes in global DNA methylation of the hippocampal region and PFC after neonatal alcohol exposure. Choline supplementation impacts global DNA methylation in these 2 brain regions in alcohol-exposed and control animals in a differential manner. The current findings suggest that both alcohol and choline have substantial impact on the epigenome in the PFC and hippocampus, and future studies will be needed to describe which gene families are impacted in such a way that function of the nervous system is changed.									24	0	0	20	0	24			0145-6008	1530-0277		WOS:000309390800005	22509990

Current magnetic field-induced particle focusing techniques rely on the use of a pair of repulsive magnets, which makes the device integration and operation difficult. We develop herein a new approach to focusing nonmagnetic particles in ferrofluid flow through a T-microchannel using a single permanent magnet. Particles are deflected across the suspending ferrofluid by negative magnetophoresis and confined by a water flow to the center plane of the microchannel, leading to a focused particle stream flowing near the bottom channel wall. Such three-dimensional diamagnetic particle focusing is demonstrated in a sufficiently diluted ferrofluid through both the top and side views of the microchannel. As the suspended particles can be visualized in bright field, this magnetic focusing method is expected to find applications to label-free (i.e., no magnetic or fluorescent labeling) cellular focusing in lab-on-a-chip devices.									29	1	0	4	0	30			1613-4982			WOS:000310394400011

For this purpose, layered electrochromic devices (ECDs) were fabricated that employed a PS PCCA film, acting as both a reflecting substrate and polymeric electrolyte, and the conducting polymer PANI-PAMPS, which served as the electrochromic layer. The resulting ECDs exhibited the attenuation of reflectance peak at the stop band position of the PCCA with a 3% of reflectance contrast ratio. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, we develop the first finite element numerical algorithms for these systems, prove stability and convergence of the algorithms, and test them computationally on problems of practical interest. It is found that unconditionally stable implementations of the Voigt regularization can be made from a simple change to existing NSE and MHD codes, and moreover, optimal convergence of the developed algorithms' solutions to physical solutions can be obtained if lower-order mixed finite elements are used. Finally, we show that for several benchmark problems, the Voigt regularization on a coarse mesh produces good approximations to NSE and MHD systems; that is, the Voigt regularization provides accurate reduced order models for NSE and MHD flows.

With bioassays of antioxidant activities in terms of total phenolic content (TPC), total anthocyanin content (TAC), total procyanidin content (TPA), oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) of different parts of the Noble muscadine, the butanol (BuOH) extract of the muscadine skin showed the highest TPC (317.91 +/- 1.83 mg GAE/100 g FW), which might be ascribed to its high TAC of 227.06 +/- 1.29 mg/100 g fresh weight (FW). The ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extract of the muscadine seed contained the highest TPA (55.30 +/- 0.63 mg CE/100 g FW). Correlation analyses demonstrated a significant linear relationship of TPC and TAC compared to their ORAC and FRAP values within the range of R-2 from 0.9283 to 0.9936, which suggested that phenolics and anthocyanins in the extracts contributed significantly to their antioxidant potential. Nineteen individual phenolics and 5 anthocyanins were identified by HPLC-MS, which indicated different chemical profiles of anthocyanins and other phenolics in the muscadine extracts. Practical Application: The paper has provided rich information of bioactive phytochemical profiles in different solvent extracts and their correlation with the antioxidant activity in the muscadine that is a very special regional fruit in U.S. Its high content of phenolic compounds demonstrates that muscadine could be beneficial to human health.									3	1	0	3	0	4			0022-1147			WOS:000309922500040	22924759

Sink or swim: lipid rafts in parasite pathogenesis								TRENDS IN PARASITOLOGY				28	10			417	426		10.1016/j.pt.2012.07.002			OCT 2012	2012	Lipid rafts, sterol- and sphingolipid-rich membrane microdomains, have been extensively studied in mammalian cells. Recently, lipid rafts have been shown to control virulence in a variety of parasites including Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia intestinalis, Leishmania spp., Plasmodium spp., Toxoplasma gondii, and Trypanosoma spp. Parasite rafts regulate adhesion to host and invasion, and parasite adhesion molecules often localize to rafts. Parasite rafts also control vesicle trafficking, motility, and cell signaling. Parasites disrupt host cell rafts; the dysregulation of host membrane function facilitates the establishment of infection and evasion of the host immune system. Discerning the mechanism by which lipid rafts regulate parasite pathogenesis is essential to our understanding of virulence. Such insight may guide the development of new drugs for disease management.									18	0	0	16	0	18			1471-4922			WOS:000309848400003	22906512

Genetic analysis using the SSR markers categorized the genotypes into two major clusters, distributed according to their pedigree. Population structure analysis suggested that the optimum number of subpopulations was three (K = 3) in the popular varieties and landraces. At K = 5 the allelic distribution was much more similar to the phylogenetic dendrogram. The molecular diversity and population structure analysis indicated that there is not much variation among the popular rice cultivars of India. The study has identified SSR markers producing unique alleles, which should aid in the precise identification, maintenance, and genetic purity analysis of rice varieties.									5	2	1	4	1	8			0006-2928			WOS:000308647900012	22689049

The additives used are non-modified nanoclay (NMN) and polymer modified nanoclay (PMN). They were added to the control PG 58-34 asphalt binder at concentrations of 2% and 4% by the weight of the asphalt binder, respectively. Superpave (TM) binder tests were employed to evaluate the characteristics of the nano-modified binders. Rheological properties of nano-modified asphalt were analyzed by use of asphalt binder tests such as Rotational Viscosity (RV), Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR) and Bending Beam Rheometer (BBR). In addition, the short- and long-term aging properties of nano-modified asphalt were analyzed, with the aging process simulated by Rolling Thin Film Oven (RTFO). and the Pressure Aging Vessel (PAV). The dissipated work per load cycle of all asphalt binders was examined, in order to better understand the properties of nano-modified asphalt. The results reveal that both viscosity and complex shear modulus of asphalt binder remarkably increase when the NMN is added into the control asphalt, and decrease slightly when the PMN is added. In addition, from the dissipated work perspective, the overall performance of PMN modified asphalt binder is improved in terms of rutting and fatigue cracking resistance relative to the NMN modified asphalt binder.

Supplemental palmitoleic (C16:1 cis-9) acid reduces lipogenesis and desaturation in bovine adipocyte cultures								JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE				90	10			3433	3441		10.2527/jas.2011-4972			OCT 2012	2012	Our objective was to determine if palmitoleic (C16:1 cis-9) acid supplementation to primary bovine adipocytes regulates lipogenic gene expression and rates of lipogenesis. Stromal vascular cells were isolated from subcutaneous and intermuscular fat, propagated, and frozen for use in this study. Cells were passaged 4 times, allowed to reach confluence, held for 2 d, and then differentiated with a standard hormone cocktail (d 0). At d 2, secondary differentiation media containing 1 of 4 concentrations of palmitoleic acid (0, 50, 150, or 300 mu M) were added for 10 d. Cells were harvested on d 6 and 12 to assess fatty acid concentrations and gene expression. In addition, (13)C2 and (13)C18:0 stable isotopes were added on d 6 to measure lipogenesis and desaturase activity, respectively. Concentrations of C16: 1 and total fatty acids increased (P < 0.05) linearly in response to palmitoleic acid supplement. Concentrations of C18:1 cis-11 and C20:1 cis-13 also increased (P < 0.01) in response to supplementation, suggesting elongation of palmitoleic acid in vitro. Concentrations of C16: 1, C18:1 cis-11, and total fatty acids were also greater (P < 0.05) at d 12 compared with d 6. In contrast, C16:0, C18:0, and C18:1 cis-9 concentrations decreased (P < 0.05) in response to palmitoleic acid supplementation and were not affected (P > 0.05) by harvest day. The ratio of C18:1 cis-9/C18:0 and fractional synthetic rate (FSR) of desaturation decreased (P < 0.05) in response to increasing palmitoleic acid supplementation. In addition, FSR of lipogenesis was reduced (P < 0.05) in palmitoleic acid-treated cells. Messenger RNA abundance as determined by real-time quantitative PCR for stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), fatty acid synthase (FASN), and elongase protein 6 (ELOVL6) genes were reduced (P < 0.05) by palmitoleic acid supplementation. Expression of a beta-oxidation gene, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A), was upregulated (P < 0.05) with palmitoleic acid supplementation in a dose-responsive manner. Supplementation of palmitoleic acid to bovine adipocytes results in increased incorporation of this fatty acid and its elongation products into the adipocyte, which downregulates SCD1, FASN, and ELOVL6 to decrease lipogenesis and upregulates CPT1A, potentially increasing beta-oxidation. These results suggest that palmitoleic acid, an end product of desaturation, can act as a regulator of lipogenesis, desaturation, and beta-oxidation in bovine adipocytes.									7	0	0	7	0	7			0021-8812	1525-3163		WOS:000309590700014	22851248

Unlike the traditional change propagation study where the focus is within the product, this study is focused to understand the propagation effects of change on other functional silos in the manufacturing firm. First, the reasons for the changes are identified using archival analysis through which it is found that 77.0 % of changes are due to internal reasons while 23.0 % are external. Second, these changes are distinguished into genesis, and propagated changes using a matrix-based modeling approach from which the reasons for propagation are identified. It is inferred that 32.4 % of the total changes are due to propagated changes such as inventory issues, manufacturing issues, and design error rectification. The majority of reasons for these propagated changes include document error rectification such as BOM error, drawing error, incorrect introduction date in engineering change note, and design error rectification such as design limitations. The findings indicate nearly one-third of time spent by the engineers can be reduced by developing appropriate controls during the change release process.									15	0	0	0	0	15			0934-9839			WOS:000309880700003

To investigate these encoding strategies in vestibular receptors and neurons, we have developed a method for calculating the stimuli delivered to a vestibular organ, the utricle, during natural (unrestrained) behaviors, using the turtle as our experimental preparation. High-speed digital video sequences are used to calculate the dynamic gravito-inertial (GI) vector acting on the head during behavior. X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans are used to determine the orientation of the otoconial layer (OL) of the utricle within the head, and the calculated GI vectors are then rotated into the plane of the OL. Thus, the method allows us to quantify the spatio-temporal structure of stimuli to the OL during natural behaviors. In the future, these waveforms can be used as stimuli in neurophysiological experiments to understand how natural signals are encoded by vestibular receptors and neurons. We provide one example of the method, which shows that turtle feeding behaviors can stimulate the utricle at frequencies higher than those typically used in vestibular studies. This method can be adapted to other species, to other vestibular end organs, and to other methods of quantifying head movements. J. Exp. Zool. 317A:467-480, 2012.

J	Yin, Jun; Coutris, Nicole; Huang, Yong				Yin, Jun/K-1037-2014				Numerical study of axonal outgrowth in grooved nerve conduits								JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING				9	5					056001	10.1088/1741-2560/9/5/056001			OCT 2012	2012	Nerve conduits with grooved inner texture, working as a topographical guidance cue, have been experimentally proved to play a significant role in axonal alignment. How grooved conduits guide axonal outgrowth is of particular interest for studying nerve regeneration. A viscoelastic model of axonal outgrowth in a conduit with a defined grooved geometry characterized by its width in the circumferential direction and its height in the radial direction is developed in this work. In this model, the axon is considered as an elastic beam and the axonal deformation and motion, including stretching, bending and torsion, are described using a Cosserat rod theory. The friction between axon and substrate is also considered in this model as well as the tip outgrowth. It is found that the directional outgrowth of the axon can be significantly improved by the grooved texture: when the groove width decreases or the groove height increases, the axonal elongation in the longitudinal direction of the conduit can be increased, which is in good agreement with experimental observations. This work is the first numerical model to study the effect of the substrate geometry on axonal outgrowth.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1741-2560			WOS:000309511200002	22872666

Therefore, the goal of this study was to determine the effect of different surfaces, i.e. random and aligned electrospun poly(e-caprolactone) meshes and two-dimensional (2D) controls, and exogenous elastogenic factors on the cultured rat aortic SMC phenotype and production of extracellular matrix. This study demonstrated that aligned electrospun fibres guide cell alignment, induce a more elongated cell morphology and promote a more synthetic phenotype. Importantly, these cells produced greater amounts of elastin-rich matrix per cell on the electrospun scaffolds. In addition, exogenous elastogenic factors severely limited rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMCs) proliferation and promoted a more synthetic SMC phenotype on electrospun meshes, but they had less effect on 2D controls. Finally, the elastogenic factors induced the SMCs to generate more matrix collagen and elastin on a per cell basis. Together, these results demonstrate the elastogenic benefits of electrospun meshes.

Using high-spectral resolution in the soft X-ray band, ORIGIN will be able to identify the physical conditions of all abundant elements between C and Ni to red-shifts of z = 10, and beyond. The mission will answer questions such as: When were the first metals created? How does the cosmic metal content evolve? Where do most of the metals reside in the Universe? What is the role of metals in structure formation and evolution? To reach out to the early Universe ORIGIN will use Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) to study their local environments in their host galaxies. This requires the capability to slew the satellite in less than a minute to the GRB location. By studying the chemical composition and properties of clusters of galaxies we can extend the range of exploration to lower redshifts (z similar to 0.2). For this task we need a high-resolution spectral imaging instrument with a large field of view. Using the same instrument, we can also study the so far only partially detected baryons in the Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM). The less dense part of the WHIM will be studied using absorption lines at low redshift in the spectra for GRBs. The ORIGIN mission includes a Transient Event Detector (coded mask with a sensitivity of 0.4 photon/cm(2)/s in 10 s in the 5-150 keV band) to identify and localize 2000 GRBs over a five year mission, of which similar to 65 GRBs have a redshift > 7. The Cryogenic Imaging Spectrometer, with a spectral resolution of 2.5 eV, a field of view of 30 arcmin and large effective area below 1 keV has the sensitivity to study clusters up to a significant fraction of the virial radius and to map the denser parts of the WHIM (factor 30 higher than achievable with current instruments). The payload is complemented by a Burst InfraRed Telescope to enable onboard red-shift determination of GRBs (hence securing proper follow up of high-z bursts) and also probes the mildly ionized state of the gas. Fast repointing is achieved by a dedicated Controlled Momentum Gyro and a low background is achieved by the selected low Earth orbit.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0922-6435	1572-9508		WOS:000309230600014

The variability of these extreme objects requires continuous all-sky coverage, while detailed study demands an improvement in sensitivity over previous technologies by at least an order of magnitude. The DUAL payload is composed of an All-Sky Compton Imager (ASCI), and two optical modules, the Laue-Lens Optic (LLO) and the Coded-Mask Optic (CMO). The ASCI serves dual roles simultaneously, both as an optimal focal-plane sensor for deep observations with the optical modules and as a sensitive true all-sky telescope in its own right for all-sky surveys and monitoring. While the optical modules are located on the main satellite, the All-Sky Compton Imager is situated on a deployable structure at a distance of 30 m from the satellite. This configuration not only permits to maintain the less massive payload at the focal distance, it also greatly reduces the spacecraft-induced detector background, and, above all it provides ASCI with a continuous all-sky exposure.									11	0	0	0	0	11			0922-6435			WOS:000309230600016

Concept-Level Analysis and Design of Polyurea for Enhanced Blast-Mitigation Performance								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				21	10			2024	2037		10.1007/s11665-011-0117-8			OCT 2012	2012	Polyurea is an elastomeric co-polymer in which the presence of strong hydrogen bonding between chains gives rise to the formation of a nano-composite like microstructure consisting of discrete hard-domains distributed randomly within a compliant/soft matrix. Several experimental investigations reported in the open literature have indicated that the application of polyurea external coatings and/or internal linings can substantially improve ballistic penetration resistance and blast survivability of buildings, vehicles and laboratory/field test-plates. Recently, it was proposed that transition of polyurea between its rubbery state and its glassy state under high deformation-rate loading conditions is the main mechanism responsible for the improved ballistic-impact resistance of polyurea-coated structures. As far as the shock-mitigation performance of polyurea is concerned, additional/alternative mechanisms such as shock-impedance mismatch, shock-wave dispersion, fracture-mode conversion, and strain delocalization have been suggested (without validation). In this study, an attempt is made to identify the phenomena and processes within polyurea which are most likely responsible for the observed superior shock-mitigation performance of this material. Towards that end, computational methods and tools are used to investigate shockwave generation, propagation, dispersion, and transmission/reflection within polyurea and the adjoining material layers as present in the case of a blast-loaded assembly consisting of a head covered with a polyurea-augmented helmet. The results obtained show that for effective shock mitigation, the operation of volumetric energy-dissipating/energy-storing processes is required. Candidate processes of this type are identified and presented.									11	0	0	1	0	11			1059-9495			WOS:000309103200002

So far a variety of particle focusing methods have been developed in microfluidic devices, among which magnetic focusing is still relatively new. We develop in this work an approach to embedding symmetrically two repulsive permanent magnets about a straight rectangular microchannel in a PDMS-based microfluidic device. The closest distance between the magnets is limited only by the sizes of the embedded and holder magnets involved in the fabrication process. The developed device is used to implement and investigate the three-dimensional magnetic focusing of polystyrene particles in ferrofluid microflow with both the top- and side-view visualizations. The effects of flow speed and particle size on the particle focusing effectiveness are studied. The developed device is also applied to magnetically focus yeast cells in ferrofluid, which proves to be biocompatible as verified by a cell viability test. In addition, an analytical model is developed and found to be able to predict the experimentally observed particle and cell focusing behaviors with reasonable agreement.									22	0	0	6	0	22			0960-1317			WOS:000309219500018

Examining the benefit of vaccinating adults against pertussis								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF NURSE PRACTITIONERS				24	10			587	594		10.1111/j.1745-7599.2012.00739.x			OCT 2012	2012	Purpose: To examine recent evidence concerning the health benefits and cost effectiveness of replacing a single dose of adult tetanus/diphtheria vaccine with a single dose of tetanus/diphtheria/pertussis (TDaP). Methods: A review of the literature was conducted utilizing the databases CINAHL and Medline with the keywords pertussis, adult immunization, vaccination, TDaP, DTaP, and healthcare workers. Conclusions: Recent outbreaks of pertussis have shown that preventing such outbreaks through immunization of adults with a single TDaP vaccine is a cost-effective measure. These studies focused on hospitals and universities where air-borne diseases are easily spread. Four hospital studies that examined the financial cost of investigating and treating a pertussis outbreak were reviewed. Results presented offer strong evidence to support vaccinating adults with TDaP at their next scheduled immunization or sooner if they are frequently exposed to populations vulnerable to pertussis. Implications for practice: Financially, investigating a single case of pertussis can cost hospitals hundreds of thousands of dollars. This is related to the time and expense of determining who was exposed and the provision of preventive treatment for those exposed. Preventing unnecessary illness and potential mortality, especially among not yet immunized infants, provides a strong argument for administration of the TDaP vaccine. Healthcare providers should educate adults about the availability and advantages of TDaP immunization and encourage them to be immunized with TDaP.									6	0	0	2	0	6			1041-2972			WOS:000309188900005	23006017

A protocol for assessing resistance to Aphelenchoides fragariae in hosta cultivars. Plant Dis. 96:1438-1444.The use of resistant and tolerant cultivars is an important component of an integrated management plan for foliar nematodes on hosta. In order to identify tolerance and resistance in commercial hosta cultivars, reliable and efficient screening methods are required. To optimize the screening protocol, a series of greenhouse experiments was conducted using six hosta cultivars and two types of nematode inoculum. The pathogenicity and reproduction of Aphelenehoides fragariae maintained on fungal cultures versus maintenance on hosta were evaluated with two inoculation methods (with injury and without injury). Both sources of inoculum were pathogenic on all six cultivars tested but the plant inoculum caused two to eight times larger lesions than the fungus inoculum. Both inocula caused larger lesions and resulted in higher reproduction rates on injured leaves than on noninjured leaves. Water soaking was more efficient than traditional Baermann funnel extraction methods. Correlations between foliage symptom severity and nematode reproduction were low or nonexistence. A numerical scale for faster assessment of disease severity was developed, and recommendations for a reliable protocol for assessment of resistance and tolerance are discussed.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0191-2917			WOS:000308899800006		
J	Kowalski, Robin M.; Morgan, Chad A.; Limber, Susan P.								Traditional bullying as a potential warning sign of cyberbullying								SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY INTERNATIONAL				33	5	SI		505	519		10.1177/0143034312445244			OCT 2012	2012	Although traditional bullying and cyberbullying share features in common, they differ in important ways. For example, cyberbullying is often characterized by perceived anonymity and can occur any time of the day or night. Conversely, perpetrators of traditional bullying are known to the victim, and most traditional bullying occurs at school. Yet, some researchers have suggested that involvement in the two types of bullying may be related. However, little research has modeled the system of relationships among the perpetration and victimization of traditional bullying and cyberbullying. The present study uses path analysis to arrive at a suitable model of these relationships, and describes the gender differences in these relationships. Students (N = 4,531) in grades 6 through 12 completed a survey examining their involvement in traditional bullying and cyberbullying. Analysis proceeded by making fit comparisons among hypothesized path models. More frequent traditional bullying perpetration and victimization were associated with higher frequency of their electronic counterparts. However, the relationship between traditional perpetration and victimization was stronger for females than males as was the effect of traditional victimization on cyber-victimization. Implications for school practitioners are presented.									49	0	0	6	1	50			0143-0343			WOS:000309140700004

This study was designed to examine the impact of urbanization and a wastewater treatment plant by investigating the impact on field-collected bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus). Results show a significant increase in DNA strand breaks in blood cells (comet assay) linked to urbanization and a reduction in DNA strand breaks downstream of the WWTP, likely the result of dilution. A laboratory study exposing L macrochirus to the known mutagen, methyl methanesulfonate, was performed to validate the comet assay endpoints in this species. Results of the laboratory study showed that the comet assay endpoints of tail length and tail extent moment responded in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Habitat quality assessments, along with chemical concentrations of polycyclic hydrocarbons in sediments showed that habitat quality between all sites were similar and that hydrocarbons likely contributed to the DNA strand breaks observed.

In addition, the combined effect of unloading and radiation has not received much attention. In the present study, we investigated the effect of proton irradiation followed by mechanical unloading via hindlimb suspension (HLS) in mice. Sixteen-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were either exposed to 1 Gy of protons or a sham irradiation procedure (n = 30/group). One day later, half of the mice in each group were subjected to four weeks of HLS or normal loading conditions. Radiation treatment alone (IRR) resulted in approximately 20% loss of trabecular bone volume fraction (BV/TV) in the tibia and femur, with no effect in the cortical bone compartment. Conversely, unloading induced substantially greater loss of both trabecular bone (60-70% loss of BV/TV) and cortical bone (approximately 20% loss of cortical bone volume) in both the tibia and femur, with corresponding decreases in cortical bone strength. Histological analyses and serum chemistry data demonstrated increased levels of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption in unloaded mice, but not IRR. HLS + IRR mice generally experienced greater loss of trabecular bone volume fraction, connectivity density, and trabecular number than either unloading or irradiation alone. Although the duration of unloading may have masked certain effects, the skeletal response to irradiation and unloading appears to be additive for certain parameters. Appropriate modeling of the environmental challenges of long duration spaceflight will allow for a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms mediating spaceflight-associated bone loss and for the development of effective countermeasures.

The new probabilistic model is expressed in the form of a mapping function that relates the liquefaction probability mathematically to the factor of safety obtained from a published deterministic CPTu-based model. The new model is novel because it is applicable to both sand and clay, is more direct (in terms of the usage of CPTu data), is more consistent with a mechanics framework, and allows complete liquefaction assessment (at least for initial screening) without recourse to additional sampling and laboratory testing. Possible variation of the model caused by the variability of the adopted database is investigated and reported. Finally, examples are provided to demonstrate how the proposed model is applied in a future event considering both model and parameter uncertainties.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0016-8505			WOS:000308697900002		
J	Gartner, William B.; Shaver, Kelly G.								Nascent entrepreneurship panel studies: progress and challenges								SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMICS				39	3	SI		659	665		10.1007/s11187-011-9353-4			OCT 2012	2012	Economics, history, organizational theory, psychology, public policy, social psychology, sociology, and strategy have all had something to say about business creation. Though the multiple lenses have produced important insights, they have not always defined the phenomenon in terms that can easily be translated from one discipline to another. Operational definitions differ. Convenience samples may suffer from retrospective biases. However, representative samples are expensive to gather. The Panel Studies of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED) are almost alone in examining the actions of entrepreneurs at the time they are organizing their businesses. This Special Issue presents a selected set of refereed papers involving the Norwegian PSED (NPSED) and Swedish PSEDs (SPSED) as well as PSED I and PSED II from the USA. In the context of highlighting the articles in this issue, some insights are offered about the kinds of research accomplishments that have been achieved. Challenges for future research on nascent entrepreneurs are also suggested.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0921-898X			WOS:000308348900009		
J	Gartner, William; Liao, Jianwen								The effects of perceptions of risk, environmental uncertainty, and growth aspirations on new venture creation success								SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMICS				39	3	SI		703	712		10.1007/s11187-011-9356-1			OCT 2012	2012	This study extends Xu and Reuf (Strateg Organ 2:331-355, 2004) by exploring the strategic and non-strategic risk-taking propensity perceptions of nascent entrepreneurs as it relates to the subsequent likelihood of venture formation success. In addition, the moderating influences of perceptions of environmental uncertainty and venture growth aspirations are also examined. Findings from an analysis of data from the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED) I indicate that an entrepreneur's risk-taking propensity has no relationship to the likelihood of successfully starting a business. Perceptions of environmental uncertainty and venture growth aspirations were positively related to non-strategic risk-taking propensity, yet none of these variables (strategic and non-strategic risk-taking propensity, environmental uncertainty and growth aspirations) had a significant effect on venture creation success. We suggest that risk-taking propensity, as measured in this study, does not play a significant role in differentiating between nascent entrepreneurs or others, or between those that are successful or unsuccessful at starting businesses.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0921-898X	1573-0913		WOS:000308348900012

Funding sources are divided into two broad categories: personal and external. We develop a set of hypotheses about the kinds of firm and nascent entrepreneur characteristics that would likely influence which categories of financial resources are used, and the amounts acquired. The majority of financing (57% of all financing) for emerging ventures comes from the personal contributions of its founders, who contributed a median amount of $5,500 per respondent. Firms that more likely to acquire external funding were projected to have higher levels of revenue, were incorporated, and were legally registered. Nascent entrepreneurs with higher levels of education and net worth were significantly more likely to acquire external funding. Results from analyses are presented and discussed. Implications of our findings are provided and suggestions for future research are offered.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0921-898X	1573-0913		WOS:000308348900015

Effect of mesh construction on the physicomechanical properties of bicomponent knit mesh using yarns derived from degradable copolyesters								JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART B-APPLIED BIOMATERIALS				100B	7			1922	1934		10.1002/jbm.b.32759			OCT 2012	2012	The use of mesh to repair abdominal wall defects has significantly increased over the past two decades owing to a perceived reduction in recurrence rates compared to primary repairs. However, the use of a mesh in vivo has introduced undesirable patient complications. As a result, there exists an unmet need for a mesh design which exhibits improved biocompatibility. In the present study, the in vitro conditioned modulation of biocompatibility-relevant physical and mechanical mesh properties using (1) absorbable yarns with different degradation profiles and (2) different mesh constructions employing the warp and weft knitting technologies was investigated. A novel warp-knit, bicomponent mesh (WK1) was developed that modulates physicomechanical properties and that (1) possesses short-term structural stiffness, (2) provides a gradual transition phase, and (3) possesses long-term compliance with forceextension properties similar to the abdominal wall. The use of two different degradable copolyester yarns facilitated the modulation of mesh physicomechanical properties, whereas the knit construction determined the resultant porosity, area weight, thickness, strength, and extension of the mesh. The lack of variation in the knit pattern for the weft knit (DM1) mesh made it one-dimensional, producing strength loss with time but showing no change in extensibility following the substantial degradation of the fast-degrading yarn.

Materials today (Kidlington, England)				15	10						10.1016/S1369-7021(12)70196-7			2012-Oct-1	2012	Stem cells hold remarkable promise for applications in disease modeling, cancer therapy and regenerative medicine. Despite the significant progress made during the last decade, designing materials to control stem cell fate remains challenging. As an alternative, materials microarray technology has received great attention because it allows for high throughput materials synthesis and screening at a reasonable cost. Here, we discuss recent developments in materials microarray technology and their applications in stem cell engineering.

Occupational therapy in health care				26	4			240	56		10.3109/07380577.2012.721575			2012-Oct	2012	The purpose of this study was to validate a driving simulator-based tool for assessing functional visual scanning while driving (Goodenough, 2010) by replicating a previous study and assessing whether the results of the task are moderated by strategic decisions regarding task prioritization. Participants completed a functional object detection task that includes a peripheral target detection task and a central braking response task. Results indicated that the simulator task can identify differences in older and younger participants' abilities to functionally scan the driving environment and these differences appear unaffected by prioritizing either the scanning or braking task.

We determined the leaf nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) concentrations, N:P ratio and leaf traits across 42 woody species planted at Hangzhou Bay Coastal Shelter Forest Experimental Site in Southeast China. We analyzed variation patterns in leaf stoichiometry, correlated leaf stoichiometry with leaf traits, and determined nutrient limitations based on leaf stoichiometry. Leaf N and P concentrations and N:P ratio averaged 18.58 mg g(-1), 2.24 mg g(-1) and 9.56, respectively. Leaf N and P concentrations were positively correlated while leaf P and leaf N:P ratio were negatively correlated across all species. Leaf dry matter content (LDMC) had a significant relationship with leaf P concentration and N:P ratio for all species, while specific leaf area (SLA) was significantly related to leaf N concentration for broadleaf species. Leaf N concentration and N:P ratio varied greatly within a site. Among the 42 species, 27 were found to be limited by N, one by P, one co-limited by N and P. and the rest not limited by either N or P. Our results provide a theoretical guideline for the construction and management of coastal shelter forests in Southeast China. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Differences in cold hardiness between introduced populations of an invasive tree								BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS				14	10			2029	2038		10.1007/s10530-012-0209-x			OCT 2012	2012	The potential for populations of exotic invasive plants to differ in their response to stressful environmental conditions is an underexplored issue in determining invasive species' range limits. Introduced genotypes may differ in response to climatic, edaphic, or biotic factors within their introduced range leading to differences in potential ranges among populations. We examined differences in cold hardiness (resistance and tolerance to winter conditions and freeze events) among Chinese tallow tree (Triadica sebifera (L.) Small) seeds and seedlings from two genetically distinct populations in the northernmost portion of its introduced U.S. range (North Carolina and South Carolina). Seed germination from these two sources was compared between fall plantings (mimicking natural dispersal timing) and spring plantings (occurring post-frost) as well as among areas within and inland of Chinese tallow's core coastal distribution in South Carolina. Overwinter seedling survival and damage were also assessed among seedlings planted in the piedmont of South Carolina and following artificial freeze events in the lab. Seeds and seedlings from South Carolina sources showed greater reductions in germination success by inland winters, greater winter damage in field plantings in the piedmont, and lower survival after prolonged freezes than those from North Carolina. These results indicate that differences in cold hardiness exist among introduced populations of Chinese tallow and suggest that genotypes from North Carolina possess greater potential for expansion into areas with more severe winters. Differences among introduced populations should be considered when evaluating the potential range expansion of Chinese tallow and other invasive species.									6	0	0	6	0	6			1387-3547			WOS:000308037700005

Revisiting the Hydrothermal growth of YAG								JOURNAL OF CRYSTAL GROWTH				356				58	64		10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2012.07.003			OCT 1 2012	2012	As new compositions and configurations of single crystals are specified for optical applications the crystal growth community must continue to optimize and explore new options for developing such materials. New crystal growth technology and a growing understanding of certain chemical and physical phenomena sometimes implore us to reconsider our perceptions even about the most studied systems. Thus, the hydrothermal growth of YAG was reexamined after nearly 40 years of inactivity and met with promising new results. While the hydrothermal growth of YAG at 500 degrees C was previously met with slow growth rates or poor crystal quality we have found that growth at 600-630 degrees C yields good quality single crystals at rates of about 0.5 mm/side/week on (100) seeds. In the current study, high quality epitaxial layers of transition metal and rare earth doped YAG have been grown from 0.1 to 2.75 mm in thickness. This has enabled several more advanced proof of concept designed growth experiments including the growth of co-doped Ca2+,Cr4+,Nd:YAG for self Q-switching, and the growth of Sm:YAG around Nd:YAG to potentially suppress amplified spontaneous emission. The interface quality of the substrate and the new growth was investigated and application of a very narrow thermal gradient at the early stages of growth has proven to greatly reduce optical scattering at the interface. The morphology of hydrothermally-grown YAG crystals is also discussed and several intermediate forms are occasionally observed.

We tested the model with data obtained from supervisor-employee matched pairs in Study 1 and matched triads in Study 2. Results revealed that: 1) supervisors who experienced higher levels of family undermining (whether reported by the immediate supervisor or a sibling) during childhood are more likely to engage in abusive supervisory behaviors as adults: and 2) this relationship is moderated such that it is stronger for supervisors with low self-control. Overall, our results highlight the role of self-control in mitigating the impact of supervisors' previous experiences of family undermining on subordinate perceptions of abusive supervision, even after controlling for previously established antecedents.

The goal herein is to understand where modeling errors and uncertainty originate from, and obtain model predictions that are statistically consistent with their respective measurements. The approach presented in this manuscript is comprehensive, as it considers all major sources of errors and uncertainty that originate from numerical solutions of differential equations (numerical uncertainty), imprecise model input parameter values (parameter uncertainty), incomplete definitions of underlying physics due to assumptions and idealizations (bias error) and variability in measurements (experimental uncertainty). The experimental evidence necessary for reducing the uncertainty in model predictions is obtained through in situ vibration measurements conducted on the masonry vaults of Washington National Cathedral. By deploying the prescribed method, uncertainty in model predictions is reduced by approximately two thirds. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The optical properties of the ZnO thin films were investigated using photoluminescence. In the UV range, the asymmetric near-band-edge emission was observed at 300 K, which consisted of two emissions at 3.338 and 3.279 eV. Eight peaks at 3.418, 3.402, 3.360, 3.288, 3.216, 3.145, 3.074, and 3.004 eV, which respectively correspond to the free exciton (FX), bound exciton, transverse optical (TO) phonon replica of FX recombination, and first-order longitudinal optical phonon replica of FX and the TO (1LO+TO), 2LO+TO, 3LO+TO, 4LO+TO, and 5LO+TO, were obtained at 12 K. From the temperature-dependent PL, it was found that the emission peaks at 3.338 and 3.279 eV corresponded to the FX and TO, respectively. The activation energy of the FX and TO emission peaks was found to be about 39.3 and 28.9 meV, respectively. The values of the fitting parameters of Varshni's empirical equation were alpha=4 x 10(-3) eV/K and beta=4.9 x 10(3) K, and the S factor of the ZnO thin films was 0.658. With increasing temperature, the exciton radiative lifetime of the FX and TO emissions increased. The temperature-dependent variation of the exciton radiative lifetime for the TO emission was slightly higher than that for the FX emission. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

We find a positive, non-spurious, and robust correlation between the Redskins' winning percentage and bureaucratic output, measured by pages published in the Federal Register. Because the Redskins' performance is prototypically exogenous, we give this result a causal interpretation and provide a plausible, causal mechanism: bureaucrats must make "logrolling" deals to expand their regulatory power, and a winning football team offers a shared source of optimism to lubricate such negotiations. We do not find the same correlation when examining congressional activity.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0048-5829			WOS:000307280000012		
J	Wang, Jia; Wang, Ke; Lin, Songyi; Zhao, Ping; Jones, Gregory; Trang, Hung; Liu, Jingbo; Ye, Haiqing								Improvement of antioxidant activity of peptides with molecular weights ranging from 1 to 10 kDa by PEF technology								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES				51	3			244	249		10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2012.05.017			OCT 2012	2012	Egg white protein powder was hydrolyzed with Alcalase to produce antioxidant peptides. Then, the peptides were fractionated with ultrafiltration membranes. The peptides (1-10 kDa) were further treated by pulsed electric field (PEF) to investigate its effect on the antioxidant activity of the peptides. Antioxidant activity was evaluated using a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical inhibition assay. The results indicated that optimal electric field intensity and standing times of REF can enhance the antioxidant activity of the peptides. Therefore, a Box-Behnken design (BBD) with three independent variables including concentration, electric field intensity and pulse frequency was used to establish the regression equation of second-order response surface. The optimal conditions were as follows: concentration 8 mg/ml, electric field intensity 10 kV/cm and pulse frequency 2400 Hz. Under these conditions, the peptides antioxidant activity was 62.64% +/- 0.98%. The present study demonstrated that the antioxidant activity of peptides (1-10 kDa) could be improved using PEF.

The Cu-Nb nanolaminates produced were 1,000-nm thick with alternating 20 or 100-nm-thick individual layers, which were fabricated by magnetron sputter deposition. Unaged Cu-Nb systems increased in hardness (from 4.3 to 5.5 GPa) with decreasing layer thickness. After aging, the nanolaminates with 20 nm layers softened greatly (5.5 GPa decreased to as little as 1.3 GPa), yet nanolaminates with 100 nm layers hardened slightly (4.3-4.8 GPa). Both nanolaminate structures exhibited significant residual tensile stress, which was further increased by up to 70 % (100 nm layers) and 120 % (20 nm layers) after accelerated aging. X-ray diffraction showed the presence of primary textures and high stress in niobium layers for unaged systems.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000306436600025		
J	Grujicic, M.; Pandurangan, B.; d'Entremont, B.								The role of adhesive in the ballistic/structural performance of ceramic/polymer-matrix composite hybrid armor								MATERIALS & DESIGN				41				380	393		10.1016/j.matdes.2012.05.023			OCT 2012	2012	Transient non-linear dynamics computational finite-element analyses are employed to investigate the role of the adhesive used in ceramic strike-face/composite back-face hybrid armor. The role of the adhesive is investigated under: (a) high loading-rate conditions accompanying impact of an armor-piercing projectile onto the armor structure; and (b) low loading rate conditions associated with the ingress of the loads which are generated at the road/tire contact interfaces and transmitted into the armor structure through the vehicle frame. The high loading-rate conditions were analyzed since they reveal the role of the adhesive under ballistic impact scenarios which controls the overall penetration resistance of the armor. On the other hand, the low loading-rate conditions were analyzed since they may reveal the potential structural damage that armor may experience due to sustained in-service loads. Since structural thermoset-polymer-based adhesives suffer from inadequate ductility, only the case of flexible (elastomer-based) adhesives was considered. The following two specific aspects of the adhesive mechanical response are given special attention: (a) strain rate sensitivity and (b) the degree of volumetric compressibility. The results obtained show that while significant improvements in the ballistic protection performance and durability of hybrid armor can be attained by proper modifications in the adhesive layer mechanical properties, there is no single combination of these properties which simultaneously optimizes all the performance requirements.

Numerical simulations of DOF distribution on axis directions indicate that the values of DOF can be extended by a factor of 1.5 or more by a modified quasi-FZP. In experiments, we employ a simple object-lens-image-plane arrangement to pick up images at various positions within the DOF of a conventional FZP and a quasi-FZP, respectively. Experimental results show that the parameter w improves foci distribution of FZPs in good agreement with theoretical predictions. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This study was designed to biotransformation litchi pericarp extract (LPE) by Aspergillus awamori to produce more bioactive compounds with stronger antioxidant activities.Results: The study exhibited that the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activities significantly (p < 0.05) increased from 15.53% to 18.23% in the water-extracted fraction and from 25.41% to 36.82% in the ethyl acetate-extracted fraction. Application of DNA cleavage assay further demonstrated the enhanced protection effect of the fermented phenolics on DNA damage. It is also noted that the water-extracted fraction of the fermented LPE possessed a much stronger capacity than the ethyl acetate-extracted fraction to prevent from damage of supercoiled DNA. Interestingly, it was found that some new compounds such as catechin and quercetin appeared after of A. awamori fermentation of LPE, which could account for the enhanced antioxidant activity.Conclusion: The DPPH radical scavenging activity and DNA protection effect of LPE were increased by Aspergillus awamori bioconversion while some compounds responsible for the enhanced antioxidant activity were identified. This study provided an effective way of utilizing fruit pericarp as a readily accessible source of the natural antioxidants in food industry and, thus, extended the application area such as fruit by-products.									7	0	0	3	0	7			1752-153X			WOS:000313130700001	23016522	
J	Larsen, M. F.; Meriwether, J. W.								Vertical winds in the thermosphere								JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS				117						A09319	10.1029/2012JA017843			SEP 26 2012	2012	The neutral vertical circulation in the thermosphere plays an important role in redistributing heat and momentum and strongly affects the neutral composition, as well as plasma and electrodynamic processes. Vertical wind measurements in this altitude range are difficult, however, and the available data give limited temporal, spatial, and vertical coverage. The available ground-based techniques are generally limited to narrow altitude ranges but provide more extended temporal coverage. The in situ techniques provide more extended altitude range coverage but have very limited temporal coverage. The most extensive measurements have come from ground-based optical techniques using the 630.0-nm F-region red-line emission and to a lesser extent the 557.7-nm E-region green-line emission. A general characteristic of these measurements is that they often show large vertical wind speeds that persist for periods of several hours or longer at the same location. The large winds have been difficult to verify because of the difficulties associated with obtaining overlapping measurements and with obtaining a sufficiently comprehensive set of measurements to understand the dynamical drivers for the vertical winds. A surprising conclusion from examining all the available measurements, however, is that there is remarkable consistency between the characteristics of the thermospheric vertical velocities measured by different techniques and at different locations. We give an overview of the available data and find that, when considered together, the available observations all show the following patterns. Vertical velocities with magnitudes of 10-20 m s(-1) are common at high latitudes, but also at mid and low latitudes. There is a slight tendency for the winds to increase with height from the E region to the F region, but the increase with height is small, and in particular, is much less than expected from the decrease of background density with altitude. Another surprising characteristic that holds true across altitudes and latitudes is that the large vertical winds frequently persist for extended periods of an hour or longer. The drivers for the observed events of large vertical winds are unknown, but the winds clearly have important implications for the dynamics, electrodynamics, plasma physics, and chemistry of the thermosphere.

Specifically, our absorbance study indicated that MWNTs were coated with multi-layers of fibrinogen to render a "hard protein corona," while SWNTs were adsorbed with thin layers of the protein to precipitate out of the aqueous phase. In addition, static quenching as a result of energy transfer from fluorescently labeled fibrinogen to their nanotube substrates was revealed by Stern-Volmer analysis. When exposed to HT-29 cells, the nanotubes and fibrinogen could readily dissociate, possibly stemming from their differential affinities for the amphiphilic membrane bilayer.

Public cotton SSR libraries (17,343 markers) were curated for sequence redundancy using 90% as a similarity cutoff. As a result, 20% of the markers (3,410) could be considered as redundant with some other markers. The marker redundancy information had been a crucial part of the map integration process, in which the six most informative interspecific Gossypium hirsutum xG. barbadense genetic maps were used for assembling a high density consensus (HDC) map for tetraploid cotton. With redundant markers being removed, the HDC map could be constructed thanks to the sufficient number of collinear non-redundant markers in common between the component maps. The HDC map consists of 8,254 loci, originating from 6,669 markers, and spans 4,070 cM, with an average of 2 loci per cM. The HDC map presents a high rate of locus duplications, as 1,292 markers among the 6,669 were mapped in more than one locus. Two thirds of the duplications are bridging homoeologous A(T) and D-T chromosomes constitutive of allopolyploid cotton genome, with an average of 64 duplications per A(T)/D-T chromosome pair. Sequences of 4,744 mapped markers were used for a mutual blast alignment (BBMH) with the 13 major scaffolds of the recently released Gossypium raimondii genome indicating high level of homology between the diploid D genome and the tetraploid cotton genetic map, with only a few minor possible structural rearrangements. Overall, the HDC map will serve as a valuable resource for trait QTL comparative mapping, map-based cloning of important genes, and better understanding of the genome structure and evolution of tetraploid cotton.									54	8	1	52	0	61			1932-6203			WOS:000309554700064	23029214

The crystal structure of 1 shows the first example of an exodentate third sulfur of the 9S3 ligand in a Pd(II) complex. Complex 1 reacts with nitromethane at room temperature in methanol to produce [Pd(9S3)(CH2NO2)(2)] (2) and acetic acid, as confirmed by H-1 NMR and C-13 NMR spectroscopy. Moreover, complex 2 has been characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Its crystal structure is the first example of any transition-metal complex containing two nitromethanate (anionic nitromethane) ligands. The complex shows the more typical elongated-square-pyramidal structure and [S2C2 + S-1] coordination with one long Pd-S axial interaction at 2.823(2) angstrom and two C-bound nitromethanate ligands. Interestingly, each nitromethanate ligand is in a different coordination environment and varies in their trans-directing abilities. Reactivity studies suggest that the complexation behavior of the 9S3 ligand and the Pd(II) center as well as the sigma-donor ability of the leaving group play key roles in the C-H activation of the nitromethane. Two related metal complexes, [Pd(dppe)(OAc)(2)] (dppe = 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane) and [Pd(9S3)(CF3COO)(2)], were synthesized, but neither of these react in a similar fashion to form a nitromethanate complex. Also, the reaction of 1 with nitrobenzene and nitrocyclopentane was studied, but these nitro-organics do not undergo C-H bond activation like nitromethane.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0276-7333			WOS:000309022700001

Mast cells are critical for innate and adaptive immune responses, often modulating allergic and pathogenic conditions. Mast cells are well known to act in response to danger signals through a variety of receptors and pathways including IL-33 and the IL-1-like receptor ST2. Here, the involvement of mast cells and the IL-33/ST2 axis in pulmonary and cardiovascular responses to multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) exposure are examined. Toxicological effects of MWCNTs are observed only in mice with a sufficient population of mast cells and are not observed when mast cells are absent or incapable of responding to IL-33. Our findings establish for the first time that mast cells and the IL-33/ST2 axis orchestrates adverse pulmonary and cardiovascular responses to an engineered nanomaterial, giving insight into a previously unknown mechanism of toxicity. This novel mechanism of toxicity could be used for assessing the safety of engineered nanomaterials and provides a realistic therapeutic target for potential nanoparticle induced toxicities.									31	1	0	26	1	32			1613-6810			WOS:000308874900016	22777948

Reassessment of the Turtle Community in the North Fork of White River, Ozark County, Missouri								COPEIA					3			367	374		10.1643/CE-10-172			SEP 20 2012	2012	In an effort to identify long-term changes in a river turtle community and its habitat, we reexamined the turtle community in a 4.6 km section of the North Fork of White River (NFWR), Ozark County, Missouri, that was previously studied between 1969 and 1980. We compared data collected in 2004 to data from 1969 and 1980 to determine if alterations in the habitat, community composition, or Northern Map Turtle (Graptemys geographica) population size and structure had occurred. Previous studies showed that the population of G. geographica declined between 1969 and 1980. Our results indicate that the population of G. geographica failed to rebound by 2004. The population of Red-eared Sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans) that established in the research section between 1971 and 1980 expanded their distribution between 1980 and 2004. Threats to the population of G. geographica included lack of basking sites, increased human recreational use of the stream, and water quality degradation.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0045-8511			WOS:000309379000001

The closest homologs of CO in woody perennial poplar (Populus spp.) are CO1 and CO2. A previous report [1] showed that the CO2/FLOWERING LOCUS T1 (FT1) regulon controls the onset of reproduction in poplar, similar to what is seen with the CO/FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) regulon in Arabidopsis. The CO2/FT1 regulon was also reported to control fall bud set. Our long-term field observations show that overexpression of CO1 and CO2 individually or together did not alter normal reproductive onset, spring bud break, or fall dormancy in poplar, but did result in smaller trees when compared with controls. Transcripts of CO1 and CO2 were normally most abundant in the growing season and rhythmic within a day, peaking at dawn. Our manipulative experiments did not provide evidence for transcriptional regulation being affected by photoperiod, light intensity, temperature, or water stress when transcripts of CO1 and CO2 were consistently measured in the morning. A genetic network analysis using overexpressing trees, microarrays, and computation demonstrated that a majority of functionally known genes downstream of CO1 and CO2 are associated with metabolic processes, which could explain their effect on tree size. In conclusion, the function of CO1 and CO2 in poplar does not appear to overlap with that of CO from Arabidopsis, nor do our data support the involvement of CO1 and CO2 in spring bud break or fall bud set.									19	2	0	17	0	21			1932-6203			WOS:000309388400085	23029015

In a subset of SMS patients, heterozygous mutations in RAI1 are found. Here we investigate the molecular properties of these mutated forms and their relationship with the resulting phenotype. We compared the clinical phenotype of SMS patients carrying a mutation in RAI1 coding region either in the N-terminal or the C-terminal half of the protein and no significant differences were found. In order to study the molecular mechanism related to these two groups of RAI1 mutations first we analyzed those mutations that result in the truncated protein corresponding to the N-terminal half of RAI1 finding that they have cytoplasmic localization (in contrast to full length RAI1) and no ability to activate the transcription through an endogenous target: the BDNF enhancer. Similar results were found in lymphoblastoid cells derived from a SMS patient carrying RAI1 c.3103insC, where both mutant and wild type products of RAI1 were detected. The wild type form of RAI1 was found in the chromatin bound and nuclear matrix subcellular fractions while the mutant product was mainly cytoplasmic. In addition, missense mutations at the C-terminal half of RAI1 presented a correct nuclear localization but no activation of the endogenous target. Our results showed for the first time a correlation between RAI1 mutations and abnormal protein function plus they suggest that a reduction of total RAI1 transcription factor activity is at the heart of the SMS clinical presentation.									11	0	0	10	0	11			1932-6203			WOS:000311313900086	23028815

Several groups have fabricated pH nanosensors by functionalizing silver or gold nanoparticle surfaces with an acidic molecule and measuring the ratio of protonated to deprotonated Raman bands. However, a limitation of these sensors is that macromolecules in biological systems can adsorb onto the nanoparticle surface and interfere with measurements. To overcome this interference, we encapsulated pH SERS sensors in a 30 nm thick silica layer with small pores which prevented bovine serum albumin (BSA) molecules from interacting with the pH-indicating 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA) on the silver surfaces but preserved the pH-sensitivity. Encapsulation also improved colloidal stability and sensor reliability. The noise level corresponded to less than 0.1 pH units from pH 3 to 6. The silica-encapsulated functionalized silver nanoparticles (Ag-MBA@SiO2) were taken up by J774A.1 macrophage cells and measured a decrease in local pH during endocytosis. This strategy could be extended for detecting other small molecules in situ.									30	0	0	10	0	30			0003-2700			WOS:000308829700062	22881392

Previously, dopant-induced changes in the Fermi velocity were observed to result in an effectively downshifted Raman peak below the G'-band for n-doped carbon nanotubes. However, in the case of N-doped graphene, we find that several Raman features vary depending upon both dopant concentration and its bonding environment. For instance, only pyridinic/pyrrolic dopants were observed to result in intense D/D'-bands with a concomitant downshift in the G'-band. Here, we correlate x-ray photoelectron measurements with Raman spectra to elucidate effects of dopant bonding configuration on vibrational properties of graphene.

Their structures were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction methods showing that the a form crystallizes in the space group Cc (No. 9), which is in one of the 10 NCS polar crystal classes, m (2/m) while the beta form crystallizes in P4(3) (No. 78) of another polar class, 4 (4/m). The unit cell parameters of the alpha form can be approximately correlated with that of the beta form via the 3 X 3 orientation matrix [0.5, 0.5, 0; -0.5, 0.5, 0; 0, 0, 2 sin beta]. The structures of these otherwise complicated phosphates exhibit two types of channels with circular and elliptical windows where the Cl-centered Cl(Bi2Cs) acentric unit is located. The neighboring acentric units are arranged in a parallel fashion in the alpha form, resulting in the monoclinic (Cc) lattice, but "antiparallel" in the beta form, thus giving the tetragonal (P4(3)) unit cell. 1-3 feature the compatible M-O-P unit that contains four crystallographically independent MOx (x = 4, 5) polyhedra, which are connected to the Cl(Bi2Cs) acentric unit through one short and one long M-II center dot center dot center dot Cl bond. The compositions of 1 and 2 consist of three Mn2+ (d(5)) and one Mn3+ (d(4)) per formula unit and that of 3 has three Fe2+ (d(6)) and one Fe3+ (ds). Bond valence sums reveal that, in the alpha phase, the trivalent site adopts distorted tetrahedral M(1)O-3+(4) coordination and, in the beta phase, distorted trigonal-bipyramidal M(4)O-3+(5). Thus far, the iron phase has only been isolated in the alpha form presumably because of little extra stabilization energy gain if the Fe2+ d(6) ion were to occupy the M(1)O-4 site. The possible origins pertaining to the structural differences in the alpha and beta forms are discussed.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0020-1669			WOS:000308778000020	22924609	
J	Barakat, Abdelali; Sriram, Aditya; Park, Joseph; Zhebentyayeva, Tetyana; Main, Dorrie; Abbott, Albert								Genome wide identification of chilling responsive microRNAs in Prunus persica								BMC GENOMICS				13						481	10.1186/1471-2164-13-481			SEP 15 2012	2012	Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs (sRNAs) approximately 21 nucleotides in length that negatively control gene expression by cleaving or inhibiting the translation of target gene transcripts. Within this context, miRNAs and siRNAs are coming to the forefront as molecular mediators of gene regulation in plant responses to annual temperature cycling and cold stress. For this reason, we chose to identify and characterize the conserved and non-conserved miRNA component of peach (Prunus persica (L.) Batsch) focusing our efforts on both the recently released whole genome sequence of peach and sRNA transcriptome sequences from two tissues representing non-dormant leaves and dormant leaf buds. Conserved and non-conserved miRNAs, and their targets were identified. These sRNA resources were used to identify cold-responsive miRNAs whose gene targets co-localize with previously described QTLs for chilling requirement (CR).Results: Analysis of 21 million peach sRNA reads allowed us to identify 157 and 230 conserved and non-conserved miRNA sequences. Among the non-conserved miRNAs, we identified 205 that seem to be specific to peach. Comparative genome analysis between peach and Arabidopsis showed that conserved miRNA families, with the exception of miR5021, are similar in size. Sixteen of these conserved miRNA families are deeply rooted in land plant phylogeny as they are present in mosses and/or lycophytes. Within the other conserved miRNA families, five families (miR1446, miR473, miR479, miR3629, and miR3627) were reported only in tree species (Populus trichocarpa, Citrus trifolia, and Prunus persica). Expression analysis identified several up-regulated or down-regulated miRNAs in winter buds versus young leaves. A search of the peach proteome allowed the prediction of target genes for most of the conserved miRNAs and a large fraction of non-conserved miRNAs. A fraction of predicted targets in peach have not been previously reported in other species. Several conserved and non-conserved miRNAs and miRNA-regulated genes co-localize with Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) for chilling requirement (CR-QTL) and bloom date (BD-QTL).Conclusions: In this work, we identified a large set of conserved and non-conserved miRNAs and describe their evolutionary footprint in angiosperm lineages. Several of these miRNAs were induced in winter buds and co-localized with QTLs for chilling requirement and bloom date thus making their gene targets potential candidates for mediating plant responses to cold stress. Several peach homologs of genes participating in the regulation of vernalization in Arabidopsis were identified as differentially expressed miRNAs targets, potentially linking these gene activities to cold responses in peach dormant buds. The non-conserved miRNAs may regulate cellular, physiological or developmental processes specific to peach and/or other tree species.									36	2	0	32	2	38			1471-2164			WOS:000309414000001	22978558	
J	Gasmi, Amir; Joseph, Paul F.; Rhyne, Timothy B.; Cron, Steven M.								The effect of transverse normal strain in contact of an orthotropic beam pressed against a circular surface								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOLIDS AND STRUCTURES				49	18			2604	2616		10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2012.05.022			SEP 15 2012	2012	The contact problem of a straight orthotropic beam pressed onto a rigid circular surface is considered using beam theories that account for transverse shear and transverse normal deformations. The circular nature of the rigid surface emphasizes the difference between Euler Bernoulli theory behavior, where point loads develop at the edge of contact, and the higher order theories that predict non-singular pressure distributions. While Timoshenko beam theory is the simplest theory that addresses this behavior, the prediction of a maximum value of pressure at the edge of contact contradicts the elasticity theory result that contact pressure must drop to zero. Transverse normal strain is therefore introduced, both to study this fundamental discrepancy and to include an important effect in many contact problems. To investigate this effect, higher order beam theories that account for both constant and linear transverse normal strain through the beam thickness are derived using the principle of virtual work. The resulting orthotropic beam theories depend on the bending stiffness (El), shear stiffness (GA), axial stiffness (EA,) and transverse normal stiffness (EA(2)), which are independent stiffness parameters that can differ by orders of magnitude. The above mentioned contact problem is then solved analytically for these theories, along with the Timoshenko beam model which assumes zero transverse normal strain. The results for different orthotropic materials show that inclusion of transverse normal deformation has a significant effect on the contact pressure solution. Furthermore, the solution using higher order beam theories encompasses the two extremes of a Hertz-like contact pressure when the half contact length is smaller than the thickness of the beam, and the Timoshenko beam theory case when the half contact length is much larger than the thickness. Concerning the behavior of the pressure at the edge of contact, adherence to the boundary conditions required by the principle of virtual work, shows that while the pressure does tend to zero, it does not become zero unless artificially enforced. In this regard the solution for the case of linear strain is better than that for constant strain. All beam solutions are validated with plane elasticity solutions obtained using the commercial finite element software ABAQUS. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Li, Chuan; Li, Lin; Zhang, Jie; Alexov, Emil								Highly efficient and exact method for parallelization of grid-based algorithms and its implementation in DelPhi								JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY				33	24			1960	1966		10.1002/jcc.23033			SEP 15 2012	2012	The GaussSeidel (GS) method is a standard iterative numerical method widely used to solve a system of equations and, in general, is more efficient comparing to other iterative methods, such as the Jacobi method. However, standard implementation of the GS method restricts its utilization in parallel computing due to its requirement of using updated neighboring values (i.e., in current iteration) as soon as they are available. Here, we report an efficient and exact (not requiring assumptions) method to parallelize iterations and to reduce the computational time as a linear/nearly linear function of the number of processes or computing units. In contrast to other existing solutions, our method does not require any assumptions and is equally applicable for solving linear and nonlinear equations. This approach is implemented in the DelPhi program, which is a finite difference PoissonBoltzmann equation solver to model electrostatics in molecular biology. This development makes the iterative procedure on obtaining the electrostatic potential distribution in the parallelized DelPhi several folds faster than that in the serial code. Further, we demonstrate the advantages of the new parallelized DelPhi by computing the electrostatic potential and the corresponding energies of large supramolecular structures.

This approach would provide unprecedented observations of atmospheric dynamics from the lower stratosphere into the middle thermosphere. Our objective was to test the Doppler wind and temperature sounder (DWTS) retrievals (including uncertainties) using realistic middle atmosphere virtual input. We present several sampling scenarios for DWTS, and demonstrate its capability to retrieve planetary-scale variations in global temperature and vector winds.

Co-expression networks model mRNA co-expression: the product of gene regulatory networks. To identify regulatory mechanisms underlying coordinated gene expression in a tissue-enriched context, ten Arabidopsis thaliana co-expression networks were constructed after manually sorting 4,566 RNA profiling datasets into aerial, flower, leaf, root, rosette, seedling, seed, shoot, whole plant, and global (all samples combined) groups. Collectively, the ten networks contained 30% of the measurable genes of Arabidopsis and were circumscribed into 5,491 modules. Modules were scrutinized for cis regulatory mechanisms putatively encoded in conserved non-coding sequences (CNSs) previously identified as remnants of a whole genome duplication event. We determined the non-random association of 1,361 unique CNSs to 1,904 co-expression network gene modules. Furthermore, the CNS elements were placed in the context of known gene regulatory networks (GRNs) by connecting 250 CNS motifs with known GRN cis elements. Our results provide support for a regulatory role of some CNS elements and suggest the functional consequences of CNS activation of co-expression in specific gene sets dispersed throughout the genome.									5	0	0	4	1	6			1932-6203			WOS:000308860100047	23024789	
J	Sau, Jay D.; Tewari, Sumanta								Topologically protected surface Majorana arcs and bulk Weyl fermions in ferromagnetic superconductors								PHYSICAL REVIEW B				86	10					104509	10.1103/PhysRevB.86.104509			SEP 13 2012	2012	A number of ferromagnetic superconductors have been recently discovered which are believed to be in the so-called "equal spin pairing" state. In the equal spin pairing state, the Cooper pairs condense forming order parameters Delta(up arrow up arrow), Delta(down arrow down arrow) which are decoupled in the spin sector. We show that these three-dimensional systems should generically support topologically protected surface Majorana arcs and bulk Weyl fermions as gapless excitations. Similar protected low-energy exotic quasiparticles should also appear in the recently discovered noncentrosymmetric superconductors in the presence of Zeeman splitting. The protected surface arcs can be probed by angle-resolved photoemission as well as Fourier transform scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments.									35	1	0	0	0	35			1098-0121			WOS:000308689600007

With deforestation advancing quickly, protected areas are increasingly becoming final refuges for threatened species and natural ecosystem processes. However, many protected areas in the tropics are themselves vulnerable to human encroachment and other environmental stresses(4-9). As pressures mount, it is vital to know whether existing reserves can sustain their biodiversity. A critical constraint in addressing this question has been that data describing a broad array of biodiversity groups have been unavailable for a sufficiently large and representative sample of reserves. Here we present a uniquely comprehensive data set on changes over the past 20 to 30 years in 31 functional groups of species and 21 potential drivers of environmental change, for 60 protected areas stratified across the world's major tropical regions. Our analysis reveals great variation in reserve 'health': about half of all reserves have been effective or performed passably, but the rest are experiencing an erosion of biodiversity that is often alarmingly widespread taxonomically and functionally. Habitat disruption, hunting and forest-product exploitation were the strongest predictors of declining reserve health. Crucially, environmental changes immediately outside reserves seemed nearly as important as those inside in determining their ecological fate, with changes inside reserves strongly mirroring those occurring around them. These findings suggest that tropical protected areas are often intimately linked ecologically to their surrounding habitats, and that a failure to stem broad-scale loss and degradation of such habitats could sharply increase the likelihood of serious biodiversity declines.									242	2	0	207	2	251			0028-0836	1476-4687		WOS:000308635900041	22832582

Simple and efficient methods to generate split roots and grafted plants useful for long-distance signaling studies in Medicago truncatula and other small plants								PLANT METHODS				8						38	10.1186/1746-4811-8-38			SEP 12 2012	2012	Background: Long distance signaling is a common phenomenon in animal and plant development. In plants, lateral organs such as nodules and lateral roots are developmentally regulated by root-to-shoot and shoot-to-root long distance signaling. Grafting and split root experiments have been used in the past to study the systemic long distance effect of endogenous and environmental factors, however the potential of these techniques has not been fully realized because data replicates are often limited due to cumbersome and difficult approaches and many plant species with soft tissue are difficult to work with. Hence, developing simple and efficient methods for grafting and split root inoculation in these plants is of great importance.Results: We report a split root inoculation system for the small legume M. truncatula as well as robust and reliable techniques of inverted-Y grafting and reciprocal grafting. Although the split root technique has been historically used for a variety of experimental purposes, we made it simple, efficient and reproducible for M. truncatula. Using our split root experiments, we showed the systemic long distance suppression of nodulation on a second wild type root inoculated after a delay, as well as the lack of this suppression in mutants defective in autoregulation. We demonstrated inverted-Y grafting as a method to generate plants having two different root genotypes. We confirmed that our grafting method does not affect the normal growth and development of the inserted root; the composite plants maintained normal root morphology and anatomy. Shoot-to-root reciprocal grafts were efficiently made with a modification of this technique and, like standard grafts, demonstrate that the regulatory signal defective in rdn1 mutants acts in the root.Conclusions: Our split root inoculation protocol shows marked improvement over existing methods in the number and quality of the roots produced. The dual functions of the inverted-Y grafting approach are demonstrated: it is a useful system to produce a plant having roots of two different genotypes and is also more efficient than published shoot-to-root reciprocal grafting techniques. Both techniques together allow dissection of long distance plant developmental regulation with very simple, efficient and reproducible approaches.									5	1	0	6	0	6			1746-4811			WOS:000311424200001	22971438

We find that rough interfaces of multiscale microstructures generated by the MS are responsible for the large reduction of both lattice thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity. Our study also finds that subsequent SPS forms a microstructure network of similar to 10 nm thick lamellae and smooth interfaces between them. This nanoscale microstructure network with smooth interfaces increases electrical conductivity while keeping a low thermal conductivity, making it an ideal microstructure for high thermoelectric efficiency.

Micronization of polyethylene terephthalate via freezing of highly sheared emulsions of polyethylene terephthalate in saturated liquid tetrahydrofuran								JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE				125	5			4034	4040		10.1002/app.36730			SEP 5 2012	2012	A novel technique for micronizing polyethylene terephthalate (PET) resin (similar to 3 mm) with saturated liquid tetrahydrofuran (THF) has been developed. PET pellets were introduced to a high-pressure vessel filled halfway with THF at loadings up to similar to 7 wt % PET. When the vessel was closed and heated, the PET pellets exhibited significant melting point depression at 190 degrees C in saturated liquid THF at 17.1 bar. Although other organic solvents were also able to depress the melting point of PET, only THF was able to facilitate the formation of an emulsion of PET-rich liquid droplets in the saturated liquid solvent when the mixture was agitated. In an attempt to generate the smallest possible PET droplets, a high-speed (5000 rpm), close-clearance, radial flow impeller was used to shear and disperse the droplets at similar to 200 degrees C and 20.1 bar. Emulsion was rapidly cooled while mixing. The PET droplets froze at similar to 190 degrees C, and the vessel was then cooled to ambient temperature. The excess liquid THF was decanted, and the PET particles were dried in a vacuum oven to remove residual THF. The PET particle sizes ranged between 2 and 70 mu m, with number, area, and volume average diameters of 6, 20, and 30 mu m, respectively. A comparison between the PET resin and PET powder properties indicated that the micronization reduced the Mw from 32,700 to 22,800. DSC results suggest that the rapid quench leads to a morphology different from equilibrium, with small somewhat imperfect crystallites, a lower overall degree of crystallinity, and a suppressed ?Cp at the glass transition.

The measurements were carried out over a range of graphite surface temperatures from 150 to 400 K and a range of incident translational energies from 275 to over 600 meV. The behavior of the widths, positions and relative intensities of the angular distributions for both CO and N-2 were found to be quite similar. The experimental measurements are discussed in comparison with calculations using a classical mechanical model that describes single collisions with a surface. Based on the behavior of the angular distributions as functions of temperature and incident translational energy, and the agreement between measured data and calculations of the single-collision model, it is concluded that the scattering process is predominantly a single collision with a collective surface for which the effective mass is significantly larger than that of a single carbon atom. This conclusion is consistent with that of earlier experiments for molecular beams of O-2 molecules and Xe atoms scattering from graphite. Further calculations are carried out with the theoretical molecular scattering model in order to predict translational and rotational energy transfers to and from the molecule during scattering events under similar initial conditions.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0953-8984			WOS:000308001400003	22898810

The interaction between decompression waves generated within the target structure produces tensile stresses which, if of a sufficient magnitude, may cause material damage and ultimate fracture (spallation). In this study, the phenomenon of spall-fracture is analyzed within a one-dimensional Lagrangian framework. Two distinct analyses are carried out. Within the first analysis, decompression waves are treated as decompression shocks, which simplified the analysis and enabled the formation of spallation-strength-based material index. In the second analysis, decompression waves are treated as smooth (centered simple) waves. This increased the fidelity of the computational analysis, but the material-selection procedure could be done only numerically and an explicit formulation of the spallation-strength-based material-selection index could not be carried out. Overall, the two analyses yielded similar results for the spallation-strength-based material-selection criterion suggesting that the simpler (decompression shock based) one is still adequate for use in the material-selection process.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1059-9495			WOS:000308185800001

These studies focused on factors such as negative emotional response to the ad and perceived social responsibility of the sponsor on intent to donate to the sponsor, the use of implicature, and truth in advertising. Our research adds to this growing body of literature by investigating the effect of self-inflicted harm versus blameless victimization in nonprofit advertising (locus of control of the harm to the victim). We find that blameless victim portrayal results in higher negative emotional response to the public service announcement (PSA), perceived social responsibility of the sponsor, and willingness to donate to the sponsor of a PSA. Specifically, the use of blameless victims seems to have the added benefit of generating more positive perceptions of the sponsor, which, in turn, also leads to higher intentions to donate.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0091-3367			WOS:000318178200004

Significant improvement of thermoelectric performance in nanostructured bismuth networks								NANO ENERGY				1	5			706	713		10.1016/j.nanoen.2012.06.005			SEP 2012	2012	We present here the first experimental evidence of a significant enhancement in the thermoelectric properties of networks containing bismuth nanotubes and nanowires fabricated via aqueous chemical routes. The as-prepared samples revealed two dominant morphologies: double wall nanotubes with 4-6 nm diameter and nanowires of 15-30 nm diameters. Transport measurements in the range 15-300 K were performed on cold pressed pellets which contained these bismuth nanostructures. We find that the cold pressed networks of nanostructured bismuth exhibit a non-metallic behavior, the corresponding room temperature resistivities vary from similar to 0.54 to 5.8 m Omega-cm, depending on the detailed nanomorphology. The measured thermal conductivity for the networks of bismuth nanotubes and nanowires is almost 5 times lower compared to bismuth powder at room temperature. The observed improvement in the thermoelectric performance has been attributed to the reduced lattice thermal conductivity of nanostructured bismuth networks via interface scattering.

J	Farajpour, Ismail; Atamturktur, Sez								Optimization-Based Strong Coupling Procedure for Partitioned Analysis								JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING				26	5			648	660		10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000169			SEP-OCT 2012	2012	The concept of partitioning a complex engineering problem into smaller, manageable components and investigating each individual component autonomously has been in use for many decades. Such partitioning approaches, however, rely on strong and occasional unwarranted assumptions regarding the interactions among different engineering components. Fluid and structure interaction, soil and structure interaction, and human and structure interaction are but a few of the many such partitioned analyses commonly needed in civil engineering applications. Recently, there has been a growing interest in combining the expertise developed separately in traditionally distinct fields to obtain a holistic treatment of engineering problems. Such holistic treatment would ultimately yield not only more realistic and accurate analyses of coupled systems but also improved optimality in engineering designs. This growing interest has resulted in development of mathematical coupling procedures for conjoining multiple, separately developed, single-solver numerical models along their interfaces. The present manuscript contributes to the field of partitioned analysis by introducing a novel mathematical coupling procedure based on the minimization of an objective function consisting of coupling conditions. The authors' approach to coupling implements optimization techniques and is observed to eliminate the divergence issues that may be encountered with iterative coupling methods. The proposed optimization-based coupling scheme is compared against the well-known block Gauss-Seidel (BGS) iteration method and considers two aspects: the accuracy of the coupled model predictions and the convergence of the coupled parameters. The comparison is completed for three case studies with increasing complexity: a linear set of equations, polynomials with random coefficients, and a linear dynamic system.

Females differed significantly among species in the structure of spines composing the armature, with Aedes spp. forming one general group, Culex spp. another, and An. punctipennis and Or. signifera a third. Relationships of species based on structural characters of the armature were consistent with recent culicid phylogenies. Although pyloric armature has been noted in mosquitoes and other insects, this is the first quantitative investigation of the mosquito pyloric armature. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In the proposed intelligent VII system, two artificial intelligence (AI) paradigms, i.e., artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector regression (SVR), are used to determine future travel time based on such information as the current travel time and VII-enabled vehicles' flow and density. The development and performance evaluation of the VII-ANN and VII-SVR frameworks, in both the traffic and communications domains, were conducted using an integrated simulation platform for a highway network in Greenville, SC. In particular, the simulation platform allows for implementing traffic surveillance and management methods in the traffic simulator PARAMICS and for evaluating different communication protocols and network parameters in the communication network simulator, Network Simulator version 2 (ns-2). This paper's findings reveal that the designed communications system can support the travel-time prediction functionality. The findings also demonstrate that the travel-time prediction accuracy of the VII-AI framework was superior to a baseline instantaneous travel- time prediction algorithm, with the VII-SVR model slightly outperforming the VII-ANN model. Moreover, the VII-AI framework was shown to perform reasonably well during nonrecurrent congestion scenarios, which have traditionally challenged sensor-based highway travel- time prediction methods.									22	3	0	0	0	25			1524-9050			WOS:000312805000034

The characteristic interference effects result from the opposite precession directions imposed on the electron spin by the two SOI couplings. The time dependence of the currents is obtained by solving numerically the equation of motion for the density operator, which is later employed in calculating statistical averages of quantum operators on few electron eigenstates. The parameterization of the problem is done in terms of the SOI coupling constants and of the phase difference between the two laser components. Our results indicate that the amplitude of the oscillations is controlled by the relative strength of the two SOI's, while their frequency is determined by the difference between the excitation energies of the electron states. Furthermore, the oscillations of the spin current acquire a beating pattern of higher frequency that we associate with the nutation of the electron spin between the quantization axes of the two SOI couplings. This phenomenon disappears at equal SOI strengths, whereby the opposite precessions occur with the same probability. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Genetic diversity was high at both the species level and at the population level. At the species level, percent polymorphic loci (P) was 96.4% (27 of 28 loci), the number of alleles per polymorphic locus (AP) was 4.07, and genetic diversity (H-e) was 0.425. Mean within population values were P = 82.6%, AP = 2.68, and H-e = 0.351. Within population genetic diversity (H-e) ranged from 0.190 to 0.466. Allelic richness values per population ranged from 37 to 71. The proportion of genetic diversity among populations (G(st)) was 0.166. Mean genetic diversity for the 3 larger populations (H-e = 0.369) and within the 6 smaller populations (H-e = 0.341) did not differ significantly (P = 0.554). Nei's unbiased genetic identity between pairs of populations ranged from 0.652 to 0.975. Mean genetic identity of individual populations with the 8 other populations ranged from 0.71 to 0.89. A Mantel test showed no significant genetic isolation by geographic distance (r = 0.065; P = 0.614). While banding patterns for most of the loci were consistent with disomic inheritance, two loci (PGI3; UGPP1) displayed patterns consistent with tetrasomic inheritance. Results of this study suggest that Big Bluestem populations in the Carolinas were once more widespread.									1	0	0	2	0	2			1528-7092			WOS:000309599500009

Habitat and landscape correlates of southern flying squirrel use of red-cockaded woodpecker clusters								JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT				76	7			1509	1518		10.1002/jwmg.395			SEP 2012	2012	Southern flying squirrels (Glaucomys volans) can have significant negative impacts on red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) reproductive success and group size. Although direct control of southern flying squirrels may be necessary in small red-cockaded woodpecker populations (<30 groups), creation of high quality habitat through landscape management is the preferred method for managing larger woodpecker populations. Thus, we determined the habitat and landscape factors within 100?m, 400?m, and 800?m of cluster centers that were related to southern flying squirrel use of red-cockaded woodpecker cavities at the Carolina Sandhills National Wildlife Refuge, South Carolina. At all spatial scales, the number of cavities in the cluster was the most influential variable determining use by southern flying squirrels. At the 400-m and 800-m scales, the amount of stream length was also positively associated with the presence of flying squirrels. The proximity and amount of hardwoods surrounding clusters were not related to southern flying squirrel use at any spatial scale; thus, removal or conversion of hardwood stands surrounding red-cockaded woodpeckers may not be necessary for reducing cavity kleptoparasitism by flying squirrels. However, when establishing recruitment clusters, areas with streams should be avoided and addition of artificial cavities to existing clusters should be done judiciously to minimize the number of excess cavities.

Herschel/PACS observations of young sources in Taurus: the far-infrared counterpart of optical jets								ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS				545						A44	10.1051/0004-6361/201219475			SEP 2012	2012	Context. Observations of the atomic and molecular line emission associated with jets and outflows emitted by young stellar objects provide sensitive diagnostics of the excitation conditions, and can be used to trace the various evolutionary stages they pass through as they evolve to become main sequence stars.Aims. To understand the relevance of atomic and molecular cooling in shocks, and how accretion and ejection efficiency evolves with the evolutionary state of the sources, we will study the far-infrared counterparts of bright optical jets associated with Class I and II sources in Taurus (T Tau, DG Tau A, DG Tau B, FS Tau A + B, and RW Aur).Methods. We have analysed Herschel/PACS observations of a number of atomic ([OI]63 mu m, 145 mu m, [C II]158 mu m) and molecular (high-J CO, H2O, OH) lines, collected within the open time key project GASPS (PI: W. R. F. Dent). To constrain the origin of the detected lines we have compared the obtained FIR emission maps with the emission from optical-jets and millimetre-outflows, and the measured line fluxes and ratios with predictions from shock and disk models.Results. All of the targets are associated with extended emission in the atomic lines; in particular, the strong [OI] 63 mu m emission is correlated with the direction of the optical jet/mm-outflow. The line ratios suggest that the atomic lines can be excited in fast dissociative J-shocks occurring along the jet. The molecular emission, on the contrary, originates from a compact region, that is spatially and spectrally unresolved, and lines from highly excited levels are detected (e.g., the o-H(2)O8(18)-7(07) line, and the CO J = 36-35 line). Disk models are unable to explain the brightness of the observed lines (CO and H2O line fluxes up to 10(-15)-6 x 10(-16) W m(-2)). Slow C- or J-shocks with high pre-shock densities reproduce the observed H2O and high-J CO lines; however, the disk and/or UV-heated outflow cavities may contribute to the observed emission.Conclusions. Similarly to Class 0 sources, the FIR emission associated with Class I and II jet-sources is likely to be shock-excited. While the cooling is dominated by CO and H2O lines in Class 0 sources, [OI] becomes an important coolant as the source evolves and the environment is cleared. The cooling and mass loss rates estimated for Class II and I sources are one to four orders of magnitude lower than for Class 0 sources. This provides strong evidence to indicate that the outflow activity decreases as the source evolves.									25	0	0	0	0	25			0004-6361			WOS:000309254900044

Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can provide information about star formation at high redshifts. Even in the absence of a bright optical/near-infrared/radio afterglow, the high detection rate of X-ray afterglows by Swift/XRT and its localization precision of 2-3 arcsec facilitates the identification and the study of GRB host galaxies.Aims. We focus on the search for the host galaxies of 17 bursts with arcsec-sized XRT error circles but no detected long-wavelength afterglow, in spite of their deep and rapid follow-up observations. Three of these events can also be classified as truly dark bursts, i.e., the observed upper limit on the optical flux of the afterglow was less than expected based on the measured X-ray flux. Our goals are to identify the GRB host galaxy candidates and characterize their phenomenological parameters.Methods. Our study is based on deep R-C and K-s-band observations performed with FORS1, FORS2, VIMOS, ISAAC, and HAWK-I at the ESO/VLT, partly supported by observations with the seven-channel imager GROND at the 2.2-m telescope on La Silla, and supplemented by observations with NEWFIRM at the 4-m telescope on Kitt Peak. To be conservative, we searched for host galaxy candidates within an area of twice the radius of each associated 90% c.l. Swift/XRT error circle.Results. For 15 of the 17 bursts, we find at least one galaxy within the searching area, and in the remaining two cases only a deep upper limit to R-C and K-s can be provided. In seven cases, we discover extremely red objects in the error circles, at least four of which might be dust-enshrouded galaxies. The most remarkable case is the host of GRB 080207, which has a color of (R-C - K-s)(AB) similar to 4.7 mag, and is one of the reddest galaxies ever associated with a GRB. As a by-product of our study we identify the optical afterglow of GRB 070517.Conclusions. Only a minority of optically dim afterglows are due to Lyman dropout (<= 1/3). Extinction by dust in the host galaxies might explain all other events. Thereby, a seemingly non-negligible fraction of these hosts are globally dust-enshrouded, extremely red galaxies. This suggests that at least a fraction of GRB afterglows trace a subpopulation of massive starburst galaxies, which are markedly different from the main body of the GRB host galaxy population, namely the blue, subluminous, compact galaxies.									34	0	0	0	0	34			0004-6361			WOS:000309254900077

Addressable, large-field second harmonic generation microscopy based on 2D acousto-optical deflector and spatial light modulator								APPLIED PHYSICS B-LASERS AND OPTICS				108	4			713	716		10.1007/s00340-012-5164-9			SEP 2012	2012	We present an addressable, large-field second harmonic generation microscope by combining a 2D acousto-optical deflector with a spatial light modulator. The SLM shapes an incoming mode-locked, near-infrared Ti:Sapphire laser beam into a multifocus array, which can be rapidly scanned by changing the incident angle of the laser beam using a 2D acousto-optical deflector. Compared to the single-beam-scan technique, the multifocus array scan can increase the scanning rate and the field-of-view size with the multi-region imaging ability.									3	0	0	1	0	3			0946-2171			WOS:000310537100003

It exploits the cell dielectrophoresis that is induced by the inherent electric field gradient at the reservoir-microchannel junction to selectively trap dead yeast cells and continuously separate them from live ones right inside the reservoir. This approach is therefore termed reservoir-based dielectrophoresis (rDEP). It has unique advantages as compared to existing dielectrophoretic approaches such as the occupation of zero channel space and the elimination of any mechanical or electrical parts inside microchannels. Such an rDEP cell sorter can be readily integrated with other components into lab-on-a-chip devices for applications to biomedical diagnostics and therapeutics.

Phenyl embraces involving the triphenylphosphine groups extend these moieties into additional dimensions, leading in two cases (1,4-F4DIB and TIE) to open structures, with filled or partially filled cavities. Comparison of structural parameters for 26 reported zigzag chains of embracing Ph3XY reveals that this synthon can adapt its registry to accommodate widely diverse structures. The strengths of the XB interactions were analyzed using natural bond orbital (NBO) theory, which provides an estimate of the energy of a donor-acceptor interaction (Delta E-d -> a) through localization of the molecular orbitals. Structures of 1:1 and 1:2 XB complexes of Ph3P=Se with 1,2-F4DIB and 1,4-F-4 were optimized at the DFT(B97-1)/BSI level. The bond distance and angles obtained are in reasonably good agreement with the experimentally observed structures.									9	0	0	0	0	9			1528-7483			WOS:000308279900006

Research on address pronoun use shows it to be an important sociocultural variable and, while there is some general consistency in use, there is also a great deal of manipulation of the pronouns to create effect or demonstrate a change in relational dynamic. Students at Northeast College and Midwest University participated in a listening task involving video clips from Russian and Soviet films. Results indicate that perception of the pronouns in a listening task is not significantly different across proficiency levels. That is, beginning and advanced learners demonstrate similar ability with the understanding of the feature. Furthermore, female learners outperformed male learners on the listening task to a statistically significant degree within each program. These results add to the body of knowledge in second language acquisition and, more specifically, to our knowledge of how pragmatic features of a language are understood by learners.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0026-7902			WOS:000309455200005		
J	Sun, Jiwei; Li, Chaojiang; Geng, Yongtao; Wang, Pingshan								A Highly Reconfigurable Low-Power CMOS Directional Coupler								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MICROWAVE THEORY AND TECHNIQUES				60	9			2815	2822		10.1109/TMTT.2012.2204275			SEP 2012	2012	This paper presents a highly reconfigurable, low-power, and compact directional coupler. The coupler uses varactors and novel active inductors to achieve wide tuning ranges of operating frequencies and coupling coefficients. The use of a low-pass circuit architecture with only two inductors minimizes chip area, power consumption, and noise. The coupler is implemented in a 0.13-mu m CMOS process. It occupies an area of 350 mu m x 340 mu m and consumes 40 mW or less power. The obtained 1-dB compression point is -3.2 dBm, and the measured noise figure is similar to 23 dB. These parameters compare favorably with previously published reconfigurable couplers. The measured coupling coefficient can be tuned from 1.3 to 9.0 dB at 4 GHz with 32 dB or better isolation and 15 dB or better return loss. The operating center frequency can be tuned from 2.0 to 6.0 GHz for a nominal 3-dB operation. These results agree with theoretical predictions and simulations reasonably well.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0018-9480	1557-9670		WOS:000309725900016

Specifically, bioplastics from protein feedstock may have significant advantages over traditional plastics, especially in areas such as packaging, agriculture, horticulture and medical materials. This article focuses on fabricating plastics from whey and albumin proteins and describing properties of plastics made from them. These protein biomasses were plasticized using water and compression molded into plastic samples. Results indicated the importance of water on plasticization during fabrication and on mechanical performance later due to densification during drying.									10	0	0	5	2	10			1566-2543			WOS:000308819700007

Soil Solarization and Biological Control for Managing Mesocriconema xenoplax and Short Life in a Newly Established Peach Orchard								PLANT DISEASE				96	9			1309	1314		10.1094/PDIS-05-11-0373-RE			SEP 2012	2012	The effects of soil solarization, with and without a Pseudomonas spp. cocktail or wheat rotation as alternatives to chemical control of Mesocriconema xenoplax, were investigated from 2004 to 2011. Preplant solarization and soil fumigation (67% methyl bromide + 33% chloropicrin mixture; henceforth, referred to as MBr) was initiated in 2004 in an orchard infested with M. xenoplax and a history of peach tree short life (PTSL). Plots consisted of nine treatments: (i) nonsolarized soil-alone, (ii) nonsolarized soil with bacteria cocktail (nonsolar-bacteria), (iii) nonsolarized soil with wheat (nonsolar-wheat), (iv) nonsolarized soil with bacteria cocktail and wheat (nonsolar-bacteria-wheat), (v) solarized soil-alone, (vi) solarized soil with bacteria cocktail (solar-bacteria), (vii) solarized soil with wheat (solar-wheat), (viii) solarized soil with bacteria cocktail and wheat (solar-bacteria-wheat), and (ix) preplant MBr fumigation. Peach trees were planted into all plots in 2005. Nematode populations were suppressed 20 months longer after orchard establishment in solar-alone and solar-wheat plots than solar-bacteria and solar-bacteria-wheat plots. Pseudomonas spp. cocktails did not have a pronounced effect in suppressing M. xenoplax in this study. Fumigation effect on M. xenoplax population density dissipated 24 months after application. Solar-wheat-treated soil was as effective as preplant MBr fumigation in increasing tree survival from PTSL for at least 6 years after orchard establishment.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0191-2917			WOS:000307679300011		
J	Huang, Chenguang; Fan, Jiahua; Zhu, Lin								Dynamic nonlinear thermal optical effects in coupled ring resonators								AIP ADVANCES				2	3					032131	10.1063/1.4743962			SEP 2012	2012	We investigate the dynamic nonlinear thermal optical effects in a photonic system of two coupled ring resonators. A bus waveguide is used to couple light in and out of one of the coupled resonators. Based on the coupling from the bus to the resonator, the coupling between the resonators and the intrinsic loss of each individual resonator, the system transmission spectrum can be classified by three different categories: coupled-resonator-induced absorption, coupled-resonator-induced transparency and over coupled resonance splitting. Dynamic thermal optical effects due to linear absorption have been analyzed for each category as a function of the input power. The heat power in each resonator determines the thermal dynamics in this coupled resonator system. Multiple "shark fins" and power competition between resonators can be foreseen. Also, the nonlinear absorption induced thermal effects have been discussed. Copyright 2012 Author(s). This article is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License.

The developed robust and scalable fabrication method is based on the selective functionalization of the PET yarns with an epoxide containing polymer that is then followed by grafting patterns of different pH-sensitive polymers PAA [poly(acrylic acid)] and P2VP [poly(2-vinyl pyridine)]. The selective functionalization of the fabric yields an array of amphiphilic channels that are constrained by hydrophobic PP boundaries. Aqueous solutions are transported in the amphiphilic channels by capillary forces where the direction of the liquid transport is defined by pH-response of the grafted polymers. The channels are fed with liquid through hydrophilic, pH insensitive PEG [polyethylene glycol] ports. The combination of the PAA and P2VP patterns in the amphiphilic channels is used to create pH-sensitive elements that redirect aqueous liquids toward PAA channels at pH > 4 and toward both PAA and P2VP channels at pH < 4. The system of pH-selective channels in the developed textile based microfluidic chip could find analytical applications and can be used for smart cloth.									15	0	0	7	0	15			1944-8244			WOS:000309099800017	22873785

Global-scale characterization of this parameter is needed to enable improved specification and forecasting of the near space environment. Global-scale measurements of horizontal wind vectors versus altitude have been performed from satellites using a variety of techniques, but the available data are still sparse. To address some of the challenges presented by space-based thermospheric wind measurement, the Doppler Asymmetric Spatial Heterodyne (DASH) technique has recently been developed. Here we present results of a ground-based validation of the DASH technique. The successful validation was performed by conducting collocated ground-based measurements with an instrument that uses the well established Fabry-Perot interferometer technique. Due to cloud cover and a limited observation period, data for only one night of simultaneous observations with minor cloud interference were obtained. The wind velocities observed by the two techniques show good overall agreement, but differences larger than the combined uncertainties are present at times. Contributions to these larger disagreements could be due to cloud interference, the minor differences in the observation geometry, or a non-zero vertical wind. A comparison of this single night of data with the Horizontal Wind Model (HWM07) climatology shows differences of up to about 100 m/s on timescales of less than an hour to several hours.

MODELING DAM-BREAK FLOOD OVER NATURAL RIVERS USING DISCONTINUOUS GALERKIN METHOD								JOURNAL OF HYDRODYNAMICS				24	4			467	478		10.1016/S1001-6058(11)60268-0			SEP 2012	2012	A well-balanced numerical model is presented for two-dimensional, depth-averaged, shallow water flows based on the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method. The model is applied to simulate dam-break flood in natural rivers with wet/dry bed and complex topography. To eliminate numerical imbalance, the pressure force and bed slope terms are combined in the shallow water flow equations. For partially wet/dry elements, a treatment of the source term that preserves the well-balanced property is presented. A treatment for modeling flow over initially dry bed is presented. Numerical results show that the time step used is related to the dry bed criterion. The intercell numerical flux in the DG method is computed by the Harten-Lax-van Contact (HLLC) approximate Riemann solver. A two-dimensional slope limiting procedure is employed to prevent spurious oscillation. The robustness and accuracy of the model are demonstrated through several test cases, including dam-break flow in a channel with three bumps, laboratory dam-break tests over a triangular bump and an L-shape bend, dam-break flood in the Paute River, and the Malpasset dam-break case. Numerical results show that the model is robust and accurate to simulate dam-break flood over natural rivers with complex geometry and wet/dry beds.									10	4	0	1	0	10			1001-6058			WOS:000308803200001

Sapphire-derived all-glass optical fibres								NATURE PHOTONICS				6	9			627	633		10.1038/NPHOTON.2012.182			SEP 2012	2012	As performance demands continue to grow, many optical fibre systems are operating at progressively higher power levels. However, Brillouin scattering restricts continued power scaling in narrow-linewidth systems. Optical fibres with engineered Brillouin properties that are manufactured using industry-accepted methods would be of great practical benefit. Here, we show all-glass optical fibres derived from sapphire that have alumina concentrations of up to similar to 55 mol%, which is considerably greater than conventionally possible and enables a series of useful properties. Specifically, a Brillouin gain coefficient of 3.1 x 10(-13) m W-1, a value nearly 100 times lower than commercial fibre, was measured for a fibre with an average alumina concentration of 54 mol%. Furthermore, a fibre with similar to 38 mol% alumina was found to be athermal, with a Brillouin frequency that was insensitive to changes in temperature. Such optical fibres may be beneficial in realizing enhanced telecommunication, sensor and high-energy laser systems.									52	2	0	0	0	54			1749-4885			WOS:000308695100017

Workload control (WLC) accomplishes this in complex make-to-order job shops by controlling lead times, capacity, and work-in-process (WIP). However, the concept has been dismissed by many authors who believe its order release mechanism reduces the effectiveness of shop floor dispatching and increases work center idleness, thereby also increasing job tardiness results. We show that these problems have been overcome. A WLC order release method known as LUMS OR (Lancaster University Management School order release) combines continuous with periodic release, allowing the release of work to be triggered between periodic releases if a work center is starving. This paper refines the method based on the literature (creating LUMS COR [Lancaster University Management School corrected order release]) before comparing its performance against the best-performing purely periodic and continuous release rules across a range of flow directions, from the pure job shop to the general flow shop. Results demonstrate that LUMS COR and the continuous WLC release methods consistently outperform purely periodic release and Constant WIP. LUMS COR is considered the best solution in practice due to its excellent performance and ease of implementation. Findings have significant implications for research and practice: throughput times and job tardiness results can be improved simultaneously and order release and dispatching rules can complement each other. Thus, WLC represents an effective means of implementing lean principles in a make-to-order context.									28	2	0	0	0	30			1059-1478			WOS:000308995100009		
J	Courter, Jason R.; Ritchison, Gary								Asymmetries in Mobbing Behavior Among Nuclear Flockmates								WILSON JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY				124	3			626	629					SEP 2012	2012	Tufted Titmice (Baeolophus bicolor) and Carolina Chickadees (Poecile carolinensis) often occur together in mixed species flocks during the non-breeding season and, as nuclear species, often initiate mobbing bouts. We compared the mobbing behavior of Tufted Titmice and Carolina Chickadees and, specifically, their tendency to approach five potential predators. We exposed flocks of chickadees and titmice to study skins of five species of raptors in 2008; raptors were categorized as either low-threat (rarely preying on chickadees or titmice) or high-threat (more likely to prey on chickadees or titmice). We noted the distance of closest approach by titmice and chickadees during trials, and whether a chickadee or titmouse spent more time within 5 m of the raptor. Titmice were more likely to remain within 5 m of both low (P = 0.0008) and high-threat (P = 0.0015) raptors. Titmice approached low-threat raptors closer than chickadees (P = 0.014). There was no difference in the mean distance of closest approach by chickadees and titmice during high-threat trials (P = 0.34). Titmice generally approached and remained closer to raptors during mobbing bouts than chickadees, possibly because larger titmice (similar to 21 g) are more likely targets of aerial predators than smaller chickadees (similar to 11 g). Titmice may be willing to take greater risks because the potential benefits (reduced risk of predation) are greater if mobbing causes potential predators to leave an area. Received 30 September 2011.

Cardiogenic Regulation of Stem-Cell Electrical Properties in a Laser-Patterned Biochip								CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR BIOENGINEERING				5	3			327	336		10.1007/s12195-012-0240-0			SEP 2012	2012	Normal cardiomyocytes are highly dependent on the functional expression of ion channels to form action potentials and electrical coupling with other cells. To fully determine the scientific and therapeutic potential of stem cells for cardiovascular-disease treatment, it is necessary to assess comprehensively the regulation of stem-cell electrical properties during stem cell-cardiomyocyte interaction. It has been reported in the literature that contact with native cardiomyocytes induced and regulated stem-cell cardiogenic differentiation. However, in conventional cell-culture models, the importance of cell-cell contact for stem-cell functional coupling with cardiomyocytes has not been elucidated due to insufficient control of the cell-contact mode of individual cells. Using microfabrication and laser-guided cell micropatterning techniques, we created two biochips with contact-promotive and -preventive microenvironments to systematically study the effect of contact on cardiogenic regulation of stem-cell electrical properties. In contact-promotive biochips, connexin 43 expression was upregulated and relocated to the junction area between one stem cell and one cardiomyocyte. Only stem cells in contact with cardiomyocytes were induced by adjacent cardiomyocytes to acquire electrophysiological properties for action-potential formation similar to that of a cardiomyocyte.									5	0	0	5	0	5			1865-5025			WOS:000308246000009	23139730

Response Surface Methodology for Meat-like Odorants from Maillard Reaction with Glutathione I: the Optimization Analysis and the General Pathway Exploration								JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE				77	9			C966	C974		10.1111/j.1750-3841.2012.02863.x			SEP 2012	2012	This study is about reaction condition optimization and exploration of the general pathway of GSH-participating Maillard reaction. Response surface methodology (RSM) is used to define the reaction condition for optimal meat flavor product generation from synthetic oligopeptides via the Maillard reaction. The optimal reaction condition is: (A) temperature: 131.53 degrees C, (B) reaction time: 94.85 min, (C) volume of 0.2M phosphate buffer: 49.61 mL and (D) initial pH of reactants: 4.79. The priority sequence is: A > D > C > B, and the verification score was 9.1. A preliminarily pathway scheme using CAMOLA has been constructed to suggest a reaction mechanism for meat-like aroma product formation. In addition, a 2-pathway and 3-stage formation scheme of the GSH-participating Maillard reaction has been constructed.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-1147			WOS:000308535500038	22888856

Consumer Awareness of Salt and Sodium Reduction and Sodium Labeling								JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE				77	9			S307	S313		10.1111/j.1750-3841.2012.02843.x			SEP 2012	2012	Reduction of dietary sodium by reduction of sodium in foods is a current industry target. Quantitative information on consumer knowledge of sodium and reduction of dietary sodium is limited. The objectives of this study were to characterize consumer knowledge and awareness of sodium and salt reduction in foods. Consumers (n= 489) participated in a quantitative internet survey designed to gather knowledge and attitudes towards dietary sodium, sodium in foods, and health. Eating habits and food consumption characteristics, knowledge of salt and sodium, and interest in health and wellness were probed. Saltiness believe and sodium knowledge indices were calculated based on correct responses to salt levels in food products. Kano analysis was conducted to determine the role of nutrition labels and satisfaction/dissatisfaction of foods. Consumers were aware of the presence of sodium in salty foods, and that sodium was part of salt. People who had a family history of certain diseases associated with a higher intake of dietary sodium did not necessarily have more knowledge of the relationship between sodium intake and a specific disease compared to consumers with no family history. Sodium content on the food label panel did not influence consumer dissatisfaction; however, sodium content did not necessarily increase consumer product satisfaction either. The addition of a healthy nutrient (that is, whole grain, fiber) into a current food product was appealing to consumers. For nutrient labeling, a reduced claim was more appealing to consumers than a free claim for unhealthy nutrients such as fat, sodium, and sugar. Practical Application: This study demonstrated the current state of consumer knowledge on sodium and salt reduction, and consumer perception of the relationship between diets high in sodium and many chronic diseases. Information that may contribute to consumer satisfaction on nutrition panel labeling was also determined.									19	1	0	10	0	19			0022-1147			WOS:000308535500018	22957915	
J	Bibo, Amin; Li, Gang; Daqaq, Mohammed F.								Performance analysis of a harmonicatype aeroelastic micropower generator								JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MATERIAL SYSTEMS AND STRUCTURES				23	13			1461	1474		10.1177/1045389X12438625			SEP 2012	2012	This article investigates the influence of the design parameters on the performance of an aeroelastic micropower generator with the goal of minimizing its cut-in wind speed and maximizing its output power. The generator, which mimics the basic physics of music-playing harmonicas, transforms wind energy into electricity via the self-excited oscillations of a piezoelectric reed embedded within a cavity. Previously, the authors have presented and validated an analytical aeroelectromechanical model describing the response behavior of the generator. By utilizing the proposed model, this study implements a stability analysis and numerical optimization algorithms to delineate the influence of the design parameters on the device's response. The effect of the electric load, chamber volume, and aperture size on the cut-in wind speed is investigated. The results illustrate that the cut-in wind speed can be reduced significantly if the device is designed with an optimal chamber volume, which is shown to be inversely proportional to the square of the beam's first modal frequency. Minimizing the aperture width is also shown to significantly reduce the cut-in speed. However, due to the reduced strain rate in the piezoelectric layer, it is observed that minimizing the wind speed does not always yield an increase in the output power. As such, a numerical investigation of the influence of the design parameters on the output power is utilized to generate design charts that assist in the selection of the optimal parameters for a known average wind speed. Several qualitative verifications of the theoretical trends are also presented through an experimental case study.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1045-389X			WOS:000308045800006

Within the numerical model of the FSW process, the FSW tool is treated as a Lagrangian component while the workpiece material is treated as an Eulerian component. The employed coupled Eulerian/Lagrangian computational analysis of the welding process was of a two-way thermo-mechanical character (i.e., frictional-sliding/plastic-work dissipation is taken to act as a heat source in the thermal-energy balance equation) while temperature is allowed to affect mechanical aspects of the model through temperature-dependent material properties. The workpiece material (AA5059, solid-solution strengthened and strain-hardened aluminum alloy) is represented using a modified version of the classical Johnson-Cook model (within which the strain-hardening term is augmented to take into account for the effect of dynamic recrystallization) while the FSW tool material (AISI H13 tool steel) is modeled as an isotropic linear-elastic material. Within the analysis, the effects of some of the FSW key process parameters are investigated (e.g., weld pitch, tool tilt-angle, and the tool pin-size). The results pertaining to the material flow during FSW are compared with their experimental counterparts. It is found that, for the most part, experimentally observed material-flow characteristics are reproduced within the current FSW-process model.									28	0	0	0	0	28			1059-9495			WOS:000308185800002		
J	Hong, Gia-Ming; Bain, Lisa J.								Arsenic Exposure Inhibits Myogenesis and Neurogenesis in P19 Stem Cells Through Repression of the -Catenin Signaling Pathway								TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES				129	1			146	156		10.1093/toxsci/kfs186			SEP 2012	2012	Epidemiological studies have correlated embryonic arsenic exposure with adverse developmental outcomes such as stillbirths, neonatal mortality, and low birth weight. Additionally, arsenic exposure reduces neuronal cell migration and maturation, and reduces skeletal muscle cell formation, alters muscle fiber subtype, and changes locomotor activity. This study used P19 mouse embryonic stem cells to examine whether arsenic exposure could alter their differentiation into skeletal muscles and neurons. When P19 cells were exposed to 0.1, 0.5, or 1.0M sodium arsenite, embryoid body (EB) formation was not altered. However, arsenic suppressed their differentiation into muscles and neurons, as evidenced by morphological changes accompanied by a significant reduction in myosin heavy chain and Tuj1 expression. Real-time PCR, immunofluorescence, and immunoblotting were used to confirm that the altered differentiation was due to the repression of muscle- and neuron-specific transcription factors such as Pax3, Myf5, MyoD, myogenin, neurogenin 1, neurogenin 2, and NeuroD in the arsenite-exposed cells. The reductions in transcription factors expression appear to be caused by repressed Wnt/-catenin signaling pathways in early embryogenesis, as evidenced by decreased -catenin expression in the arsenic-exposed EBs on differentiation days 2 and 5. Interestingly, the expression of Nanog, a transcription factor that maintains the pluripotency of stem cells, was increased after arsenite exposure, indicating that arsenite inhibits their differentiation but not proliferation. This study demonstrates that arsenic can perturb the embryonic differentiation process by repressing the Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway. More importantly, this study may provide insight into how arsenic exposure affects skeletal and neuronal differentiation during embryogenesis.									15	2	0	14	0	17			1096-6080			WOS:000308234000013	22641621

The Delphi technique was chosen as means of setting priorities for nursing research. This method enlisted feedback from all levels of nurses from various practice areas and various nursing roles. A series of 3 rounds of surveys provided feedback. Mixed methods were utilized to reach consensus on the various themes/topics that emerged in each round. In the final survey round, nurses ranked the final themes as to the level of importance, which resulted in identification of the key top 5 priorities. The priorities are the foundation for a research agenda for the coming years. The nursing research council, led by the clinical nurse specialist chairperson, reviewed the results and generated a comprehensive review of literature for current evidence on each priority topic. Evidence was critiqued, rated, and resulted in research questions that formulated the research agenda. The priorities were integrated within the pillars of excellence that are the foundation of the institutions' strategic goals. Using this technique provides a beneficial and structured way to gain input from those who need to own the work of building nursing research within an institution. Positive factors, such as beginning with input from all levels, the ease of providing feedback, and using a Delphi method study to bring alignment within an organization, serve to strengthen nursing research into a much broader scope and focus.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0887-6274			WOS:000308136100008	22903207

In this paper, we derive the equations of motion for Shoot-the-Moon using a Lagrangian approach and examine the underactuated, nonlinear, and nonholonomic dynamics. Two ball position controllers are designed, one using a local linearization and another using the nonlinear dynamics. Simulations of both controllers are performed, showing that the ball converges to the setpoint position for the linearized controller and continuous signals can be tracked by the nonlinear controller. Finally, the experimental results are presented for the nonlinear controller applied to a physical implementation of Shoot-the-Moon. The effect of the nonholonomic constraint relating the ball's linear and angular position is demonstrated. This system has rich dynamics that can provide a challenging problem for control design and serve as a new educational example.

More than 60% of grandparents provided grandchild care over the 10-year period; more than 70% of those did it for 2 years or more. Grandparents with fewer functional limitations and more economic resources were more likely to start or continue nonresidential care, whereas relatively disadvantaged grandparents were more likely to start and continue coresidential care. Grandparents who were African American, younger, married, living with fewer minor children of their own, or had more grandchildren were more likely to start care, particularly nonresidential care. African Americans and Hispanics were more likely than Whites to start and continue coresidential care. These findings demonstrate the heterogeneity of caregiving and point to the lack of resources among those who provide coresidential care.									21	0	0	1	1	22			0192-513X			WOS:000306839700001

A comparative study of GPU programming models and architectures using neural networks								JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING				61	3			673	718		10.1007/s11227-011-0631-3			SEP 2012	2012	Recently, General Purpose Graphical Processing Units (GP-GPUs) have been identified as an intriguing technology to accelerate numerous data-parallel algorithms. Several GPU architectures and programming models are beginning to emerge and establish their niche in the High-Performance Computing (HPC) community. New massively parallel architectures such as the Nvidia's Fermi and AMD/ATi's Radeon pack tremendous computing power in their large number of multiprocessors. Their performance is unleashed using one of the two GP-GPU programming models: Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) and Open Computing Language (OpenCL). Both of them offer constructs and features that have direct bearing on the application runtime performance. In this paper, we compare the two GP-GPU architectures and the two programming models using a two-level character recognition network. The two-level network is developed using four different Spiking Neural Network (SNN) models, each with different ratios of computation-to-communication requirements. To compare the architectures, we have chosen the two extremes of the SNN models for implementation of the aforementioned two-level network. An architectural performance comparison of the SNN application running on Nvidia's Fermi and AMD/ATi's Radeon is done using the OpenCL programming model exhausting all of the optimization strategies plausible for the two architectures. To compare the programming models, we implement the two-level network on Nvidia's Tesla C2050 based on the Fermi architecture. We present a hierarchy of implementations, where we successively add optimization techniques associated with the two programming models. We then compare the two programming models at these different levels of implementation and also present the effect of the network size (problem size) on the performance. We report significant application speed-up, as high as 1095x for the most computation intensive SNN neuron model, against a serial implementation on the Intel Core 2 Quad host. A comprehensive study presented in this paper establishes connections between programming models, architectures and applications.									7	0	0	2	0	7			0920-8542	1573-0484		WOS:000308110100016

Rotational alignment is one factor thought to affect clinical outcome. The purpose of this study was to assess relationships between prosthesis rotational alignment, function score and knee kinematics after TKA.In 80 patients a cemented, unconstrained, cruciate-retaining TKA with a rotating platform was implanted. Rotational alignment was measured using CT-scans. Kinematics was assessed using fluoroscopy images.Seventy-three patients were available for follow-up after two years. Nine patients had more than 10A degrees rotational mismatch between the femoral and tibial component in the postoperative CT scans. These patients showed significantly worse results in the function score. While the normal patients with less than 10A degrees rotational mismatch improved from a mean pre-operative 55 points to a mean 71 points at follow-up, the group with more than 10A degrees mismatch deteriorated from a mean 60 points pre-operatively to a mean 57 points at follow-up. The pattern of motion during passive flexion from approximately 0A degrees to 120A degrees was quite different. While external rotation steadily increased with knee flexion in the normal group, there was internal rotation between 30A degrees and 80A degrees of flexion in the group with more than 10A degrees rotational mismatch.Rotational mismatch between femoral and tibial components exceeding 10A degrees resulted in different kinematics after TKA. It might contribute to worse clinical results observed in those patients and should therefore be avoided.									9	0	0	2	0	9			0341-2695			WOS:000307994300013	22643798

At the cellular level it is unclear whether the suppression of cardiac Ca2+ channels (CaV1.2) results directly from oxygen deprivation on the channel protein or is mediated by intermediary proteins affecting the channel. To address this question we measured the early effects of hypoxia (560 s, ) on Ca2+ current (ICa) and tested the involvement of protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation, Ca2+/calmodulin-mediated signalling and the haem oxygenase (HO) pathway in the hypoxic regulation of CaV1.2 in rat and cat ventricular myocytes and HEK-293 cells. Hypoxic suppression of ICa and Ca2+ transients was significant within 5 s and intensified in the following 50 s, and was reversible. Phosphorylation by cAMP or the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid desensitized ICa to hypoxia, while PKA inhibition by H-89 restored the sensitivity of ICa to hypoxia. This phosphorylation effect was specific to Ca2+, but not Ba2+ or Na+, permeating through the channel. CaMKII inhibitory peptide and Bay K8644 reversed the phosphorylation-induced desensitization to hypoxia. Mutation of CAM/CaMKII-binding motifs of the a1c subunit of CaV1.2 fully desensitized the Ca2+ channel to hypoxia. Rapid application of HO inhibitors (zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP) and tin protoporphyrin (SnPP)) suppressed the channel in a manner similar to acute hypoxia such that: (1) ICa and IBa were suppressed within 5 s of ZnPP application; (2) PKA activation and CaMKII inhibitors desensitized ICa, but not IBa, to ZnPP; and (3) hypoxia failed to further suppress ICa and IBa in ZnPP-treated myocytes. We propose that the binding of HO to the CaM/CaMKII-specific motifs on Ca2+ channel may mediate the rapid response of the channel to hypoxia.									6	1	0	5	0	7			0022-3751			WOS:000308095900014	22753548	
J	Chin, Wynne W.; Thatcher, Jason Bennett; Wright, Ryan T.								ASSESSING COMMON METHOD BIAS: PROBLEMS WITH THE ULMC TECHNIQUE								MIS QUARTERLY				36	3			1003	1019					SEP 2012	2012	Recent work, in journals such as MIS Quarterly and Management Science, has highlighted the importance of evaluating the influence of common method bias (CMB) on the results of statistical analysis. In this research note, we assess the utility of the unmeasured latent method construct (ULMC) approach in partial least squares (PLS), introduced by Liang et al. (2007). Such an assessment of the ULMC approach is important, because it has been employed in 76 studies since it appeared in MIS Quarterly in early 2007. Using data generated via Monte Carlo simulations, we use PLS structural equation modeling (SEM) to demonstrate that the ULMC approach of Liang et al. is neither able to detect, nor control for, common method bias. Method estimates using this approach resulted in negligible estimates, regardless of whether there were some, large, or no method bias introduced in the simulated data. Our study contributes to the IS and research methods literature by illustrating that, and explaining why the ULMC approach does not accurately detect common method bias in PLS. Further, our results build on prior work done using covariance-based SEM questioning the usefulness of the ULMC technique for detecting CMB.									39	0	0	0	0	39			0276-7783			WOS:000307606300018

We conducted interviews with forty Christian clergy who lead congregations in the vicinity of one large southeastern US city. Seven in ten clergy interviewed expressed uncertainty in their personal opinions about homosexuality, uncertainty about how they should act pursuant to the issue, or both. We describe clergy's experiences with these uncertainties and analyze the patterns in which it appears in their opinions and actions regarding homosexuality. The nuance evident in these patterns illustrates how a range of superseding factors influence clergy's opinions about homosexuality and the extent to which they feel constrained in taking action with regard to the issue. We argue for the conceptual value of a framework that provides space for analysis of uncertainty in public opinion about contentious social issues such as homosexuality.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0034-673X	2211-4866		WOS:000307396300006

The best laboratory tool achieves 95 % accuracy on average, while tools used in daily living typically achieve 60-80 % accuracy. This paper describes a new method for measuring intake via automated tracking of wrist motion. Our method uses a watch-like device with a micro-electro-mechanical gyroscope to detect and record when an individual has taken a bite of food. Two tests of the accuracy of our device in counting bites found that our method has 94 % sensitivity in a controlled meal setting and 86 % sensitivity in an uncontrolled meal setting, with one false positive per every 5 bites in both settings. Preliminary data from daily living indicates that bites measured by the device are positively related to caloric intake illustrating the potential of the device to monitor energy intake. Future research should seek to further explore the relationship between bites taken and kilocalories consumed to validate the device as an automated measure of energy intake.									30	0	0	6	0	30			1090-0586	1573-3270		WOS:000307537600008	22488204	
J	Kousik, Chandrasekar S.; Donahoo, Ryan S.; Hassell, Richard								Resistance in watermelon rootstocks to crown rot caused by Phytophthora capsici								CROP PROTECTION				39				18	25		10.1016/j.cropro.2012.04.004			SEP 2012	2012	Crown rot caused by Phytophthora capsici is becoming an increasingly important disease of vegetable crops in southeastern U.S. In recent years, the practice of grafting watermelon onto rootstocks belonging to other Cucurbitaceae genera has also been slowly gaining adoption in the U.S. However, it is not known how these rootstocks, developed mainly in Asia, will respond to diseases prevalent in local production areas. We evaluated the available commercial watermelon rootstocks for resistance to Phytophthora crown rot by inoculating them with a zoospore suspension of P. capsici in four different trials. Disease development on rootstocks was rated on a 1-9 scale (1 = no symptoms. 9 = plant dead). Based on all the four trials, the commercial Lagenaria siceraria (bottle gourd) rootstocks, FR-Strong, Emphasis, Macis and WMXP-3938 were resistant (Mean rating <= 3) to crown rot when compared to susceptible watermelon checks (mean rating >8). All Cucurbita inter-specific hybrid rootstocks and a watermelon rootstock Ojakkyo, were highly susceptible to crown rot (mean rating >8). Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using two different P. capsici specific primers (ITS and p-tubulin) indicated the presence of significantly (P < 0.0001) greater amounts of P. capsici DNA g(-1) plant tissue in susceptible Cucurbita inter-specific hybrid rootstocks (beta-tubulin, mean = 2895 ng) and watermelon (2665 ng) compared to the L siceraria rootstocks (357 ng). Crown rot resistant bottle gourd rootstocks may be useful in areas where P. capsici is a recurring problem.

Data also indicated FHD predicted work-family balance, well-being, and intention to leave above and beyond the individual components of actual and desired family hours, whereas WHD did not predict beyond individual components. Work-family balance mediated relationships between FHD and quality of life, stress, depression, and intention to leave.This study provides support for incorporation of discrepancy indices in future work-family research. FHD predicted outcomes over and above the individual components of actual and desired hours whereas WHD did not, suggesting that compatibility between what an individual desires and experiences in the family domain may have a stronger influence on well-being and organizational outcomes compared to compatibility in the work domain.These results are important given past focus on concepts such as work schedule fit (e.g., Moen, It's about time: couples and careers, 2003), in that we extend past findings by also incorporating fit between values and experiences in the family domain, and linking discrepancies with work-family balance, well-being, and organizational outcomes.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0889-3268			WOS:000307335400007

However, field experimental evidence documenting these shifts has never been reported for a cleaning symbiosis. Here, we demonstrate shifts in a freshwater cleaning symbiosis in a system involving crayfish and branchiobdellid annelids. Branchiobdellids have been shown to benefit their hosts under some conditions by cleaning material from host crayfish's gill filaments. The system is uniquely suited as an experimental model for symbiosis due to ease of manipulation and ubiquity of the organisms. In three field experiments, we manipulated densities of worms on host crayfish and measured host growth in field enclosures. In all cases, the experiments revealed shifts from mutualism to parasitism: host crayfish growth was highest at intermediate densities of branchiobdellid symbionts, while high symbiont densities led to growth that was lower or not significantly different from 0-worm controls. Growth responses were consistent even though the three experiments involved different crayfish and worm species and were performed at different locations. Results also closely conformed to a previous laboratory experiment using the same system. The mechanism for these shifts appears to be that branchiobdellids switched from cleaning host gills at intermediate densities of worms to consuming host gill tissue at high densities. These outcomes clearly demonstrate shifts along a symbiosis continuum with the maximum benefits to the host at intermediate symbiont densities. At high symbiont densities, benefits to the host disappear, and there is some evidence for a weak parasitism. These are the first field experimental results to demonstrate such shifts in a cleaning symbiosis.									26	0	0	23	0	26			0029-8549			WOS:000307757600018	22349861

GPS as a Method for Assessing Spatial and Temporal Use Distributions of Nature-Based Tourists								JOURNAL OF TRAVEL RESEARCH				51	5			591	606		10.1177/0047287511431325			SEP 2012	2012	Traditional methods of collecting spatial and temporal use data are burdensome to both tourists and researchers, and they often lack needed accuracy. This article examines emergent GPS technology and its application to tracking nature-based tourists. Two applications of GPS presented here demonstrate the usefulness and functionality of GPS for tracking nature-based tourists in most natural recreation environments and in open, complex systems. This study finds that GPS offers advantages over traditional methods for tracking visitors, including more reliable, accurate, and precise data. GPS makes measuring and understanding visitor use patterns even more valuable since actual movements can be investigated instead of reported movements. Also, the accuracy and detail of GPS-collected data allow for analyses and investigations not otherwise possible. Visitor-based GPS surveys represent a useful and potentially powerful tool to help better plan, manage, and monitor nature-based tourists.									27	0	0	7	0	27			0047-2875			WOS:000307449000006

Respondents answered questions about monitoring practices for insects, diseases and weeds, prevention techniques, intervention decisions, concerns about IPM and educational opportunities. Survey respondents were categorized into three groups based on IPM knowledge and pest management practices adopted. RESULTS: The three groups differed in the use of standardized sampling plans for scouting pests, in monitoring techniques, e.g. sticky cards, phenology and growing degree days, in record-keeping, in the use of spot-spraying and in the number of samples sent to a diagnostic clinic for identification and management recommendation. CONCLUSIONS: Stronger emphasis is needed on deliberate scouting techniques and tools to monitor pest populations to provide earlier pest detection and greater flexibility of management options. Most respondents thought that IPM was effective and beneficial for both the environment and employees, but had concerns about the ability of natural enemies to control insect pests, and about the availability and effectiveness of alternatives to chemical controls. Research and field demonstration is needed for selecting appropriate natural enemies for augmentative biological control. Two groups utilized cooperative extension almost exclusively, which would be an avenue for educating those respondents.

Consistent with this claim, we find that senators from states with larger percentages of African-Americans among the electorate and more racially conservative preferences among whites provide worse representation of black interests in the Senate than their counterparts. We also apply theories of congressional cross-pressures in considering how senator partisanship and region moderate the effect of white racial attitudes on black representation. Finally, consistent with the racial threat hypothesis, we show that the negative effect of white racial attitudes on the quality of black representation is stronger when state unemployment rates are higher.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0190-9320			WOS:000307270300001

J	Wheeler, A.

The plant is dioecious, its inconspicuous male and female flowers borne on separate individuals. From 2003 to 2012 (mainly 2007-2012), rosemary was sampled periodically (with all months included at least once during the period) in sand ridges of peninsular Florida and two riverine dunes in southeastern Georgia. Branches of male and female plants were tapped separately into a beating net. Sampling during the final three years was female-plant-biased to facilitate work on fruit- and seed-feeding heteropterans. Nymphs and adults of three pentatomoid species were found on C. ericoides: the pentatomid Thyanta custator custator (F.) and scutellerids Diolcus chrysorrhoeus (F.) and Homaemus proteus Stal. Only T. c. custator was taken in both states, occurring at 19 sites (19 nymphs, 53 adults); D. chrysorrhoeus was found in Florida at 16 sites (9 nymphs, 165 adults). The collection of T. c. custator and D. chrysorrhoeus from female rosemary plants essentially throughout the sampling period, including nymphs, exuviae, and mating pairs, coupled with their near absence from male plants, suggests that the bugs are not incidental on rosemary but feed on its fruits. Whether either species completes its life cycle on rosemary is unknown. Three nymphs and eight adults of the little-known H. proteus were collected from female rosemary plants at four sites, but the scutellerid's relationship to C. ericoides remains to be determined. Briefly noted is the collection of the pentatomid Euschistus obscurus (Palisot de Beauvois) and scutellerid Stethaulax rnarmoratus (Say), whose adults were collected infrequently on female rosemary plants in Florida.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0090-0222			WOS:000209233200006		
J	Deitch, Sandra; Gao, Bruce Z; Dean, Delphine								Effect of matrix on cardiomyocyte viscoelastic properties in 2D culture.								Molecular & cellular biomechanics : MCB				9	3			227	49					2012-Sep	2012	Cardiomyocyte phenotype changes significantly in 2D culture systems depending on the substrate composition and organization. Given the variety of substrates that are used both for basic cardiac cell culture studies and for regenerative medicine applications, there is a critical need to understand how the different matrices influence cardiac cell mechanics. In the current study, the mechanical properties of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes cultured in a subconfluent layer upon aligned and unaligned collagen and fibronectin matrices were assessed over a two week period using atomic force microscopy. The elastic modulus was estimated by fitting the Hertz model to force curve data and the percent relaxation was determined from stress relaxation curves. The Quasilinear Viscoelastic (QLV) and Standard Linear Solid (SLS) models were fit to the stress relaxation data. Cardiomyocyte cellular mechanical properties were found to be highly dependent on matrix composition and organization as well as time in culture. It was observed that the cells stiffened and relaxed less over the first 3 to 5 days in culture before reaching a plateau in their mechanical properties. After day 5, cells on aligned matrices were stiffer than cells on unaligned matrices and cells on fibronectin matrices were stiffer than cells on collagen matrices. No such significant trends in percent relaxation measurements were observed but the QLV model fit the data very well. These results were correlated with observed changes in cellular structure associated with culture on the different substrates and analyzed for cell-to-cell variability.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1556-5297			MEDLINE:23285736	23285736

Still, designers often apply exclusively reductionist approaches to generate designs. One way to address this issue is to reduce ambiguity in the whole systems approach. This paper describes research to define and unify elements of whole systems design. Elements were identified through a methodical review of sources describing theories, perspectives, and practices from multiple design disciplines. These elements were coded and then organized using concept mapping. The resulting framework has 20 elements categorized as processes, principles, and methods. This framework is meant to help enable more widespread application of whole systems design in practice. Published by Elsevier Ltd.									15	0	0	1	0	15			0142-694X			WOS:000307144200002

Injectable in situ forming controlled release implant composed of a poly-ether-ester-carbonate and applications in the field of chemotherapy								JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A				100A	9			2365	2372		10.1002/jbm.a.34179			SEP 2012	2012	Polymeric controlled delivery systems hold great promise in the field of modern medicine. Such technology has already been converted into commercially viable products in a myriad of fields. Chemotherapy is an example of such an area where constant efficacious levels of drug can greatly enhance clinical outcomes. The key to designing such therapies is the preparation of the proper delivery system. To this end, a series of bioresorbable polyether-ester-carbonate copolymers have been developed, which when combined with a diluent, are capable injection into the body and consistently forming a drug delivery depot. The study delineated here aimed at producing a more effective treatment of a common drug, paclitaxel, using the polymeric carrier. The polymer carrier system exhibited controlled release of paclitaxel both in vitro and in vivo. Drug concentrations were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography and apoptotic activity was confirmed through flow cytometry. Relevant success was exhibited by the regression of tumor size following a multiple injection treatment regimen in a murine xenograft model. This multiple injection treatment shows promising results when compared to the traditional paclitaxel paradigm of a single injection for a period of 3 weeks. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Through simulations, we clarify the effects of PFL length, switch speed, and switch resistance on the output pulses. We model and analyze CMOS pulse generators with on-chip transmission lines (TLs) as PFLs and CMOS transistors as switches. In a 0.13-mu m CMOS process with a 500-mu m long PFL, post-layout simulations show that pulses of 10.4-ps width can be obtained. High-voltage and high-power outputs can be generated with other pulsed power circuits, such as Blumlein PFLs with stacked MOSFET switches. Thus, the PFL circuit significantly extends short and high-power pulse generation capabilities of CMOS technologies. A CMOS circuit with a 4-mm-long PFL is implemented in the commercial 0.13-mu m technology. Pulses of similar to 116-ps duration and 205-300-mV amplitude on a 50-Omega load are obtained when the power supply is tuned from 1.2 to 1.6 V. Measurement connection setup is the main reason for the discrepancies among measurements, modeling, and simulation analyses.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1063-8210			WOS:000306518900001

We identified a gene putatively coding for Class I C4H in apricot and plum and we analyzed the expression pattern of this gene under different apricot/plum graft combinations with different degree of compatibility. The full-length cDNA is 1 739 bp with a 1 515 bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 504 amino acids. Like other C4Hs, the predicted C4H polypeptides included conserved domains of cytochrome P-450. The genomic sequence of the apricot C4H gene was interrupted by two introns 335 bp and 904 bp long. Several regulatory motifs including P-, A-, L- and H-boxes, which were conserved across phenylpropanoid metabolism-related genes in higher plants, were found in a 1 300 bp upstream promoter region of the apricot C4H gene. A phylogenetic analysis showed that all Prunus sequences clustered together and were closely related to Malus and Rubus C4H genes. The transcription of Class I PruC4H was detected in all the examined graft combinations, which suggested its rather constitutive character.									5	0	0	5	0	5			0006-3134			WOS:000303062400006

Two different sizes of GRT were used for this project: 40 mesh (often used in Asphalt Industry), and 300 mesh which is used in other industries. The concentration of the monomer (acrylic acid), reaction temperature and the reaction time (1 and 3 h) are important factors on the grafting degree - especially because our goal was not to use any initiator during the reaction (there are well known procedures for grafting of polymers by using different type of initiators). Our effort was towards simplifying the grafting process and to make it much faster and less expensive (more acceptable by the industry). The microstructural and morphological changes of the GRT particles were characterized by Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), viscosity test of the modified asphalt binder [PG 64-22 asphalt binder with virgin GRT particles (40 and 300 mesh), and PG 64-asphalt binder with M treated GRT particles of the same size]. Dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) test of the modified asphalt binder was also performed. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was investigated on untreated and AA treated 300 mesh GRT particles. Results showed that with the addition of surface modified GRT particles increased the viscosity and failure temperature values of asphalt binder regardless of binder source and grade.

Finite element model developed to analyze the dome is calibrated against both non-destructive vibration measurements and destructive load-displacement measurements up to failure. The model is then executed to simulate incremental development of cracks. The first natural frequency and remaining load carrying capacity of the dome are monitored to define the desired empirical relationship, which is ultimately generalized for spherical domes with varying span-to-height ratios.

Based on qualitative data, I put forward a three pronged frame-work that organizes overarching faculty responses to one university's transition. I focus most specifically on one faculty response, which I call operationalizing in order to show how faculty members take agency in a moment of complex change that illuminates tensions between faculty, university leaders and the field of higher education, more generally. Contributing to the literature on faculty agency, mission creep/striving and change in higher education, I unpack specific ideas and practices that faculty used as they took agency over their careers.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0018-1560			WOS:000305887100004		
J	Hedetniemi, Sandra M.; Hedetniemi, Stephen T.; Jiang, Hao; Kennedy, K. E.; McRae, Alice A.								A self-stabilizing algorithm for optimally efficient sets in graphs								INFORMATION PROCESSING LETTERS				112	16			621	623		10.1016/j.ipl.2012.02.014			AUG 31 2012	2012	The efficiency of a set S subset of V in a graph G = (V, E), is defined as epsilon(S) = vertical bar{v is an element of V - S: vertical bar N(v) boolean AND S vertical bar = }vertical bar 1; in other words, the efficiency of a set S equals the number of vertices in V - S that are adjacent to exactly one vertex in S. A set S is called optimally efficient if for every vertex v is an element of V - S, epsilon(S boolean OR {v}) <= epsilon(S), and for every vertex u is an element of S, epsilon(S - {u}) < epsilon(S). We present a polynomial time self-stabilizing algorithm for finding an optimally efficient set in an arbitrary graph. This algorithm is designed using the distance-2 self-stabilizing model of computation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0020-0190			WOS:000306870200002

Poly-(bis((mu(4)-1,4-benzenedicarboxylato)-bis(mu(2)-N,N-dimethylformamide)-(nitra-to)- gadolinium (III))) metal organic framework: Synthesis, magnetic and luminescence properties								INORGANICA CHIMICA ACTA				391				1	9		10.1016/j.ica.2012.04.039			AUG 30 2012	2012	The title gadolinium benzenedicarboxylate based metal organic framework of chemical formula, C28H36Gd2N6O18, was synthesized under solvothermal conditions in the presence of DMF. The crystal structure is monoclinic, space group P2(1)/c, with unit cell dimensions of a = 17.668(2) angstrom, b = 20.005(3) angstrom, c = 10.5382(15) angstrom, and beta = 91.205(2)degrees, Z = 4, V = 3723.9(9) angstrom(3), rho (calculated) = 1.889 mg/m(3). The unit is defined by four DMF molecules, two nitrate ions, two benzene dicarboxylate (BDC) units and two Gd atoms. Each Gd atom is coordinated to eight oxygen atoms, one from each of four dicarboxylate ions, one from each of two DMF molecules, and two from the single nitrate anion. The three dimensional framework is formed from the interconnectivity of a chainlike arrangement between BDC and Gd only, with one BDC bridging two Gd atoms. Elemental percentage composition was as follows: Gd = 30.9, C = 32.28, H = 3.33, N = 7.28, which are in agreement with calculated values of Gd = 31.7, C = 31.74, H = 3.40, N = 7.94. Gd-O bond lengths ranged between 2.290 and 2.511 angstrom. The material is paramagnetic due to f(7) unpaired Gd electrons, and also displays orange-yellow photoluminescence due to the presence of trace Eu ions in the structure when excited with UV radiation.

Spectroscopic data demonstrate that strategic placement of sterically encumbered mesityl groups about the metal binding sites enforces a 1:1 metal to bipy binding ratio. This steric coordination control ensures that the metalated polymers remain solution processable rather than forming insoluble networks via coordinative cross-linking. The solution photophysical and electrochemical properties of metal-free and metalated materials are reported and compared with those of related conjugated polymers and conducting metallopolymers.									11	1	0	0	0	11			0024-9297	1520-5835		WOS:000307988500004

The system consists of polarization maintaining (PM) fiber and PM-fiber components including tapered fiber bundle pump combiners, a single-mode to large mode area mode field adapter, and a fiber-coupled isolator. The laser components ultimately determine the system architecture and the limits of laser performance, particularly considering the immature and rapidly developing state of fiber components in the 2 mu m wavelength regime.

J	Fan, Jiahua; Zhu, Lin								Enhanced optomechanical interaction in coupled microresonators								OPTICS EXPRESS				20	18			20790	20799		10.1364/OE.20.020790			AUG 27 2012	2012	We investigate the optomechanical interaction in two coupled microresonators. Compared to the single resonator optomechanical system where the input light is required to detune from the cavity resonance to generate two asymmetrical sidebands and thus large mechanical damping/amplification, the coupled resonator system can allow both the input light and its frequency sideband to be on resonance. In this configuration, we find that the optomechanical interaction can be enhanced and optically induced energy transfer between different mechanical oscillators is possible.

A total of 1000 measurements (half and half of normal and malignant tissues) were obtained from 16 recta. The normal rectal tissue has a larger scattering coefficient ranging from 1.09 to 5.41 mm(-1) with a mean value of 2.29 mm(-1) (std:+/-0.32), while the malignant group shows lower scattering property and the values ranging from 0.25 to 2.69 mm(-1) with a mean value of 1.41 mm(-1) (std:+/-0.18). The peri-cancer of recta has also been investigated to distinguish the difference between normal and malignant rectal tissue. The results demonstrate that the quantitative analysis of the rectal tissue can be used as a promising diagnostic criterion of early rectal cancer, which has great value for clinical medical applications.									7	0	0	3	0	7			0031-9155			WOS:000307112600013	22850124
