However, genomic resources for these early branching angiosperm lineages are very limited. In this study, we describe the construction of a large-insert bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library from L. tulipifera. Flow cytometry estimates that this nuclear genome is approximately 1,802 Mbp per haploid genome (+/- 16 SD). The BAC library contains 73,728 clones, a 4.8-fold genome coverage, with an average insert size of 117 kb, a chloroplast DNA content of 0.2%, and little to no bacterial sequences nor empty vector content clones. As a test of the utility of this BAC library, we screened the library with six single/low-copy genic probes. We obtained at least two positive clones for each gene and confirmed the clones by DNA sequencing. A total of 182 paired end sequences were obtained from 96 of the BAC clones. Using BLAST searches, we found that 25% of the BAC end sequences were similar to DNA sequences in GenBank. Of these, 68% shared sequence with transposable elements and 25% with genes from other taxa. This result closely reflected the,content of random sequences obtained from a small insert genomic library for L. tulipifera, indicating that the BAC library construction process was not biased. The first genomic DNA sequences for Liriodendron genes are also reported. All the Liriodendron genomic sequences described in this paper have been deposited in the GenBank data library. The end sequences from shotgun genomic clones and BAC clones are under accession DU169330DU169684. Partial sequences of Gigantea, Frigida, LEAFY, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, 4-coumarate:CoA ligase, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase genes are under accession DQ223429-DQ223434.									16	1	0	14	0	17			1614-2942			WOS:000247665900004

Results indicated that these species bioconcentrated Hg, Se, and As at factors of up to 1,911, 10,981, and 4,927, respectively. Plant tissue concentrations decreased as Hg, Se, and As were translocated from the roots to the aerial portions of the plant. Greatest element concentrations in S. californicus were found in roots, indicating that an exclusion mechanism may be responsible for element tolerance by this plant species. Greater root:shoot transfer of Hg, Se, and As was observed with T. angustifolia than with S. californicus, suggesting that element tolerance was more likely due to an internal detoxification mechanism. To completely assess ecological risks associated with the use of constructed wetlands, contaminant bioavailability for plant uptake, translocation, and bioconcentration must be considered.									11	0	0	11	0	12			0049-6979			WOS:000247392100018		
J	Norsworthy, Jason K.; Oliveira, Marcos J.								A model for predicting common cocklebur (Xanthium strumarium) emergence in soybean								WEED SCIENCE				55	4			341	345		10.1614/WS-06-185.1			JUL-AUG 2007	2007	The objective of this research was to develop a model to predict common cocklebur seedling emergence in spring tillage and no-spring-tillage systems in the presence and absence of a soybean canopy. A Weibull function was used to accumulate heat units (i.e., growing degree days) at a 2.5 cm soil depth on days when mean soil temperature, soil water potential, and soil thermal fluctuation were above established thresholds. The base temperature, soil water potential, and soil thermal fluctuation thresholds used for model development were 17 C, -100 kPa, and 7.5 C, respectively. A single function adequately described common cocklebur seedling emergence in the presence and absence of drill-seeded soybean from data combined over an artificial (2004) and natural seedbank (2005) (R-2 = 0.986). Model parameterization differed between the artificial and natural seedbank in the absence of spring tillage, but emergence was adequately described, regardless of soybean presence. Separate parameter estimates for the artificial and natural seedbanks were needed to adequately describe emergence in the system without spring tillage (R2 = 0.975 to 0.984). The ability of the model to account for reduced emergence when soil moisture is limited or when daily thermal fluctuation requirements are not met could assist practitioners with assessments associated with field scouting for weeds as well as other management decisions.									12	0	0	10	1	12			0043-1745			WOS:000248037700010

Taper equations for five major commercial tree species in manitoba, Canada								WESTERN JOURNAL OF APPLIED FORESTRY				22	3			163	170					JUL 2007	2007	Kozak's variable exponent taper equation was fitted for balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera L.), trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), white spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss), black spruce (Picea mariana [Mill.] B.S.P.), and jack pine (Pinus banksiona Lamb.) in Manitoba. Stem taper variability between two ecozones (i.e., Boreal Shield and Boreal Plains) were tested using the Ftest. Regional differences were observed for trembling aspen, white spruce, and jack pine, and for those species, separate ecozone-specific taper equations were developed. However, the gross total volume estimates using the ecozone-specific equations were different from those of the provincial equations by only 2 percent. Although the regional difference in stem form was marginal within a province, a difference of approximately 7 percent of gross total volume estimation was found when our provincial taper equations were compared with those developed in Alberta and Saskatchewan. These results suggest that stem form variation increases with spatial scale and that a single taper equation for each species may be sufficient for each province.									10	5	0	6	1	11			0885-6095			WOS:000248098400003

Flooding of the island is influenced by flooding events of the Pee Dee River (PD) on the western side of the island, Big and Little Bull Creeks (BC) on the eastern side, and daily tidal fluctuations. Above-ground NPP ranged between 477 g/m(2) and 1117 g/m(2) while mean above-ground NPP was 743 g/m(2) when all data were combined regardless of growing seasons or sites. Mean annual litterfall and sternwood production were 463 g/(m(2) year) and 279 g/(m(2) year), respectively, for all three growing seasons. Analyses also showed that the 3-year average above-ground NPP was significantly higher (p < 0.0001) on the PD side (839 g/(m(2) year)) than on the BC side (647 g/(m(2) year)). In contrast, water tupelo leaves on the BC side decomposed faster (k = 2.04) than on the PD side (k = 1.59) probably due to microenvironmental factors such as temperature and moisture availability. Nutrient ratios (C:N, C:P, and N:P) indicated continuous N limitation on both sides of the island in respect to litter quality and nutrient deficiency. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

During the observing period, 10 events with discernible quasiperiodic echo structure were observed with the coherent scatter radar. In six of those events, simultaneous measurements were made with the Arecibo 430-MHz incoherent scatter radar. The imaging coherent scatter radar allows us to locate and track the echo structures within the volume illuminated by the transmitter, which shows structures that are generally aligned along wavefronts. A slight preference for motion of the structures toward the southwest is evident throughout the period, but the propagation directions and speeds vary greatly. The incoherent scatter radar measurements show a close correspondence between the occurrence of the coherent echoes and the location of the enhanced electron density structures. In particular, the coherent echoes occur when the electron density layers show uplifts.									21	0	0	0	0	21			2169-9380	2169-9402		WOS:000247538500004

These enzymatic activities are precursors of DNA repair and are fueled by metal ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+, with the former being associated with protein binding and the latter with DNA cleavage. Using the technique of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), we determined the single-molecule kinetics of endo V in a catalytic cycle using a substrate of deoxyinosine-containing single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). The ssDNA was labeled with TAMRA, a fluorescence donor, while the endo V was labeled with Cy5, a fluorescence acceptor. The time lapses of FRET, resulting from the sequential association, recognition, and dissociation of the deoxyinosine by the endo V, were determined at 5.9, 14.5, and 9.1 s, respectively, in the presence of Mg2+. In contrast, the process of deoxyinosine recognition appeared little affected by the metal type. The prolonged association and dissociation events in the presence of the Ca2+-Mg2+ combination, as compared to that of Mg2+ alone, support the hypothesis that endo V has two metal binding sites to regulate its enzymatic activities.									9	0	0	8	0	9			0006-2960			WOS:000247145100006	17521169

The liquefaction potential index developed by Iwasaki and his co-workers is modified using the concept of probability. The modified liquefaction potential index is then calibrated with field observation data, which yields an empirical equation for the probability of liquefaction-induced ground failure. The method and procedure is then employed to study the ground shaking level of the 1886 Charleston, South Carolina earthquake based on an analysis of liquefaction hazard in the Charleston peninsula. The results show that the ground shaking level of the 1886 event may be represented with moment magnitude M-w=6.9 and peak ground surface acceleration a(max)=0.2 g. Finally, the liquefaction hazard in the Charleston quadrangle is evaluated and mapped using the ground motion that corresponds to the 475-year return period. Details of this assessment, including limitation of the results, are presented. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									11	0	0	0	0	11			0013-7952			WOS:000247756000006

It is usual to use expensive commercial CAD/CAM programs for NC data of 5-axis machining, since it needs very large calculations for optimal tool positioning and orientation, tool path planning, and collision-free tool path generation. Since commercial CAD/CAM systems have similar functions and efficiency based on common algorithms of reliable theories, they do not have their own unique features for machining speed and efficiency. In other words, most commercial CAD/CAM systems consider only the characteristics of part geometry to be machined, which means that they generate almost the same NC data if the part to be machined is the same, even though different machines are used for the part. A new approach is proposed for optimizing NC data of 5-axis machining, which is based on the characteristics of the machine to be operated. As a result, the speed of 5-axis machining can increase without losing machining accuracy and surface quality. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Cost analysis and optimization for IP multicast group management								COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS				30	8			1721	1730		10.1016/j.comcom.2007.02.002			JUN 8 2007	2007	This paper studies the system parameters that affect the total cost of managing the multicast group on a router. A Petri net model is first proposed to describe the states and transitions of the multicast group management. Based on this model, a delayed vacation queue, extended from a simple M/M/1 queue, is used to analyze the total cost of the multicast group management under various system conditions. The formal analysis reveals that the total cost of the multicast group management is minimized when a router delays a certain time to send its pruning messages to upstream routers. Furthermore, a formula is derived to calculate the optimal delay time for sending the pruning messages to minimize the multicast group management cost. To validate this cost analysis model, an IP multicast group management module is added to the NS-2 simulator to simulate the IF multicast group management. The simulation results under various system parameters are consistent with the results obtained by formal analyses, validating the proposed cost analysis model. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Catches of bloodsucking blackflies (Diptera : Simuliidae) tell different stories depending on sampling method								ENTOMOLOGICA FENNICA				18	2			110	116					JUN 6 2007	2007	To compare different sampling techniques, blackflies were captured along six Swedish rivers in 2001 and 2002, using two fundamentally different methods: (1) daytime trapping with a vehicle-mounted net, and (2) exposure of CO2-baited traps. The methods were selectively different for different species of blackflies. Some species were caught relatively more frequently by vehicle trapping and others by CO2 trapping. Only rarely were species catches proportionally similar between the two methods. We suggest that the different catch success reflects differences in host-searching behaviour in the species present and that the sampling methods are complementary.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0785-8760			WOS:000247269000005

Correlation between lightning types								GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS				34	11					L11804	10.1029/2007GL029476			JUN 2 2007	2007	The spatial correlation of cloud-to-ground (CG), intracloud (IC), and narrow-bipolar event (NBE) lightning was investigated. Lightning data were collected for a two-month period in Florida. Separate analyses were performed for lightning over land and lightning over water. Space-time cells were defined, and lightning flash density was computed on each cell for the three lightning types. Correlation coefficients were computed for each of the three pairs of lightning types: CG-IC, IC-NBE, and CG-NBE. The CG-IC lightning pair was correlated most strongly. Best fit curves were also produced for each pair of lightning densities. These were second order polynomial fits in log space. These fits displayed curvature on log-log axes, signifying that the relative fractions of lightning types vary with storm intensity. The land/water separation did not have a strong effect on the relationships.									1	1	0	0	0	2			0094-8276			WOS:000246940100004		
J	Nance, Holly A.								Cranial osteology of the African gerrhosaurid Angolosaurus skoogi (Squamata; Gerrhosauridae)								AFRICAN JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY				56	1			39	75					JUN 2007	2007	Phylogenetic relationships both within and between the scincomorph families Gerrhosauridae and Cordylidae are in need of re-examination. Currently the basal gerrhosaurid is unknown, although Angolosaurus skoogi previously was proposed as the sister taxon to mainland African gerrhosaurids. Many details of the cranial osteology of A. skoogi are also unknown because of the rarity in museum collections and elusive lifestyle of this dune-dwelling lizard, endemic to the Namib Desert. In this study, High-Resolution X-ray Computed Tomography (HRXCT) was used to study in detail the cranial osteology of A. skoogi. Results of this study enabled completion of the first anatomical description of the skull and mandible of A. skoogi. Throughout the description, reference is made to a fully labeled cross-sectional HRXCT data set, available online as supplementary material. Detailed information on cranial osteology obtained from these data can help resolve the contentious placement of A. skoogi within Gerrhosauridae. Unlike other Cordyliformes (Gerrhosauridae + Cordylidae), the postfrontal in A. skoogi is not extensive and does not extend posteriorly beyond the orbital margin. The squamosal is not bifurcated anteriorly in A. skoogi, unlike other gerrhosaurids. In the braincase of A. skoogi, there is no separate foramen for passage of the glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX). This morphological study emphasizes the utility of both HRXCT scans and disarticulated skeletal material as valuable sources of phylogenetically-informative data.									5	0	0	6	0	6			0441-6651			WOS:000247809700003

Although carrying capacity strategies can be used to cope with use-related impacts, there is little understanding of divers themselves, their management preferences, and how preferences relate to conservation goals. By using a stated preference choice modeling approach, we investigated the choices divers make in selecting diving trips to marine protected areas as defined by use level, access, level of supervision, fees, conservation education, and diving expectations. Logit models showed that divers preferred a more restrictive management scenario over the status quo. Divers favored reductions in the level of site use and increased levels of conservation education. Divers did not favor fees to access protected areas, having less access to the resource, or extensive supervision. Finally, divers were much more willing to accept increasingly restrictive management scenarios when they could expect to see increased marine life.									27	0	0	11	0	27			0044-7447			WOS:000247451500006	17626469

To investigate this further, we characterized Rubisco activase and explored its role in the previously demonstrated thermal acclimation and inhibition of two genotypes of Acer rubrum originally collected from Florida (FL) and Minnesota (MN). When plants were grown at 33/25 degrees C (day/night) for 21 d, the FL genotype compared to the MN genotype maintained about a twofold increase in leaf photosynthetic rates at 33-42 degrees C and had a 22% increase in the maximal rate of Rubisco carboxylation (V-cmax) at 33 degrees C under nonphotorespiratory conditions. Both genotypes had two leaf Rca transcripts, likely from equivalent alternative splicing events. The RCA1 and RCA2 proteins increased modestly in FL plants under warmer temperature, while only RCA2 protein increased in MN plants. Rubisco large subunit (RbsL) protein abundance was relatively unaffected in either genotype by temperature. These results support the idea that Rubisco activase, particularly the ratio of Rubisco activase to Rubisco, may play a role in the photosynthetic heat acclimation in A. rubrum and may have adaptive significance. This mechanism alone is not likely to entirely explain the thermotolerance in the FL genotype, and future research on adaptive mechanisms to high temperatures should consider activase function in a multipathway framework.									18	0	0	18	0	18			0002-9122			WOS:000249830600003	21636461

Curcumin, a constituent of the Indian spice turmeric has been investigated for its anti-inflammatory activity and may offset some of the damage and functional deficits associated with downhill running. This study examined the effects of curcumin on inflammation and recovery of running performance following downhill running in mice. Male mice were assigned to downhill placebo (Down-Plac), downhill curcumin (Down-Cur), uphill placebo (Up-Plac), or uphill curcumin (Up-Cur) groups and run on a treadmill at 22 m/min at - 14% or + 14% grade, for 150 min. At 48 h or 72 h after the up/downhill run, mice (experiment 1) underwent a treadmill performance run to fatigue. Another subset of mice was placed in voluntary activity wheel cages following the up/downhill run (experiment 2) and their voluntary activity (distance, time and peak speed) was recorded. Additional mice (experiment 3) were killed at 24 h and 48 It following the up/downhill run, and the soleus muscle was harvested for analysis of inflammatory cytokines (IL-I beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha), and plasma was collected for creatine kinase analysis. Downhill running decreased both treadmill run time to fatigue (48 h and 72 h) and voluntary activity (24 h) (P < 0.05), and curcumin feedings offset these effects on running performance. Downhill running was also associated with an increase in inflammatory cytokines (24 h and 48 h) and creatine kinase (24 h) (P < 0.05) that were blunted by curcumin feedings. These results support the hypothesis that curcumin can reduce inflammation and offset some of the performance deficits associated with eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.									61	1	0	45	0	63			0363-6119			WOS:000247725300009	17332159

The nonlinear hereditary-type stress-strain relations for metals with temperature effects								APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION				189	1			844	851		10.1016/j.amc.2006.11.146			JUN 1 2007	2007	The objective of this paper is to present the approach to the development of hereditary-type theory with due account of temperature influencing the time dependent mechanical behavior of metals and alloys. The primary step included the designing of the model with the hereditary-type governing equation structured to account for the thermal effect. It is shown that the whole temperature influence can be modeled by introducing the special power function with one additional parameter, which is put under the integral. Isothermal and quasi-isothermal processes with abrupt change of temperature are considered. The proposed hereditary-type model with temperature effect is verified experimentally.

Possible identification of a metal-rich old moving group: High-resolution spectroscopy of candidate members								ASTRONOMICAL JOURNAL				133	6			2654	2658		10.1086/517970			JUN 2007	2007	Using new high-resolution spectroscopic observations from both the McDonald Observatory 2.7 m and Kitt Peak National Observatory 4 m telescopes, we observed four candidate members of the Ursa Major moving group previously suggested to instead belong to a significantly older kinematic assemblage. The Fe abundances we measure strongly suggest that these stars are not UMa members but form a more metal-rich group of stars ( +0.10 <= [Fe/H] <= + 0.18) with an age near 3 Gyr. Our [ Ca/H] determinations corroborate this result. The apparent similarities in metallicity and previously discovered UVW space motions lend credence to prior suggestions that these stars belong to a field kinematic structure of uniform age. Li abundances have also been derived from the 6707 8 feature for all four stars and show the differences expected from the stars' varying evolutionary states. The low Li abundance of one object, HD88654, does not support its previously reported status as a post-T Tauri star candidate.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0004-6256			WOS:000246987400018

The affected broiler pullet flock was housed on the first floor of a two-story confinement building. Mortality increased to 0.1%/day compared to the flock on the second floor, which had mortality levels of less than 0.01%/day. Clinical signs in the affected chickens included inactivity, decreased response to stimuli, and anorexia. No respiratory or neurologic signs were observed. On necropsy, affected pullets were dehydrated and emaciated and had disseminated variably sized single or multiple heterophilic granulomas that contained intralesional septate and branching fungal hyphae. Lesions were extensive around the base of the heart in the thoracic inlet and in the kidneys. Other affected organs included eyelid, muscle, proventriculus, ventriculus, intestine, liver, spleen, lung, and heart. Aspergillus flavus was cultured from the visceral granulomas. The source of flock exposure to the organism was not determined.									11	0	0	9	1	11			0005-2086			WOS:000247088700022	17626498

In vivo cellular repopulation of tubular elastin scaffolds mediated by basic fibroblast growth factor								BIOMATERIALS				28	18			2830	2838		10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.02.031			JUN 2007	2007	In vivo tissue engineering has been explored as a method to repopulate scaffolds with autologous cells to create a functional, living, and non-immunogenic tissue substitute. In this study, we describe an approach to in vivo cellular repopulation of a tissue-derived tubular elastin scaffold. Pure elastin scaffolds were prepared from porcine carotid arteries (elastin tubes). Elastin tubes were filled with agarose gel containing basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) to allow sustained release of growth factor. These tubes were implanted in subdermal pouches in adult rats. The elastin tubes with growth factor had significantly more cell infiltration at 28 days than those without growth factor. Immunohistochemical staining indicated that most of these cells were fibroblasts, of which a few were activated fibroblasts (myofibroblasts). Microvasculature was also observed within the scaffolds. Macrophage infiltration was seen at 7 days, which diminished by 28 days of implantation. None of the elastin tubes with bFGF calcified. These results demonstrated that the sustained release of bFGF brings about repopulation of elastin scaffolds in vivo while inhibiting calcification. Results showing myofibroblast infiltration and vascularization are encouraging since such an in vivo implantation technique could be used for autologous cell repopulation of elastin scaffolds for vascular graft applications.

Neomycin prevents enzyme-mediated glycosaminoglycan degradation in bloprosthetic heart valves								BIOMATERIALS				28	18			2861	2868		10.1016/j.biomaterials.2007.02.017			JUN 2007	2007	Bioprosthetic heart valves (BHVs) derived from glutaraldehyde crosslinked porcine aortic valves are frequently used in heart valve replacement surgeries. However, BHVs have limited durability and fail either due to degeneration or calcification. Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), one of the integral components of heart valve cuspal tissue, are not stabilized by conventional glutaraldehyde crosslinking. Previously we have shown that valvular GAGs could be chemically fixed with GAG-targeted chemistry. However, chemically stabilized GAGs were only partially stable to enzymatic degradation. In the present study an enzyme inhibitor was incorporated in the cusps to effectively prevent enzymatic degradation. Thus, neomycin trisulfate, a known hyaluronidase inhibitor, was incorporated in cusps via 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS) chemistry followed by glutaraldehyde crosslinking (NEG). Controls included cusps crosslinked with either EDC/NHS followed by glutaraldehyde (ENG) or only with glutaraldehyde (GLUT). NEG group showed improved resistance to in vitro enzymatic degradation as compared to GLUT and ENG groups. All groups showed similar collagen stability, measured as a thermal denaturation temperature by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The cusps were implanted subdermally in rats to study in vivo degradation of GAGs. NEG group preserved significantly more GAGs than ENG and GLUT. NEG and ENG groups showed reduced calcification than GLUT. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									17	0	0	9	0	17			0142-9612			WOS:000246868000008	17353047

The simulation of the small-strain triaxial tests by the MPP model shows that nonlinear stress-strain characteristics of clays can be adequately accounted for at small strain, including the characteristic of high initial Young's modulus. Two well-documented excavation case histories are used to assess the MPP model. Satisfactory predictions are obtained of the excavation-induced wall deflection and ground surface settlement by finite element method (FEM) that incorporates the MPP model. The lateral soil deformation behind the wall can also be reasonably predicted. The simplified MPP model is shown to be effective for modeling the excavation-induced wall and ground movements.									14	6	0	0	0	19			0008-3674			WOS:000248569900008

Control of the molecular weight distribution of petroleum pitches via dense-gas extraction								CHEMICAL ENGINEERING & TECHNOLOGY				30	6			742	748		10.1002/ceat.200700024			JUN 2007	2007	Dense-gas extraction (DGE) was used to fractionate an isotropic petroleum pitch (number-average molecular weight M-n = 516) into oligomeric cuts. A countercurrent-flow packed column was used to effect the separation, with supercritical toluene being used as the dense-gas solvent and commercially available M-50 or A-240 pitch being used as the feed. Isothermal operation at 330, 350, and 380 degrees C was investigated, as well as operation with a linear positive temperature gradient (+Delta T), with the bottom of the column at 330 and the top at 380 degrees C. For isothermal operation, the molecular weight distribution of the bottom products consisted primarily of dimer (M-n = 508) and trimer (M-n = 759) species, with pressure changes of as little as 5 bar producing significant changes in their relative distribution, as observed by MALDI mass spectrometry. On the other hand, by operating with a +Delta T, we could produce a bottom product consisting primarily of trimers and tetramers (Mn = 997).					3rd International Meeting on High Pressure Chemical Engineering3rd International Meeting on High Pressure Chemical Engineering	20062006		Erlangen, GERMANYErlangen, GERMANY	10	0	0	1	0	10			0930-7516			WOS:000247332700012

The primary burrowing crayfish Distocambarus crockeri exhibits a high degree of habitat specialization and is largely limited to open canopied terrestrial habitats maintained along roadsides, utility rights-of-way, and agricultural field edges within a portion of the South Carolina piedmont, USA. Crayfish abundance, vegetation structure, and negative binomial regression were used to model the habitat of D. crockeri. Modeling indicated that within a community-defined landscape patch context, D. crockeri was a prairie specialist. Historical descriptions of areas within the species' range indicated that prairie-like habitats (piedmont prairies) were a regular component of the landscape. The congruence between habitat models and historical data indicate that prairie habitat was a natural component of the historic piedmont landscape and that the habitat specificity of D. crockeri contained spatial information about this lost landscape component.									5	0	0	4	0	5			0906-7590			WOS:000247115600006

The authors used the teamwork literature to create potential items, which they tested using two surveys of college students (Ns = 2,777 and 1, 157). The authors used exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis to help them select items for the final instrument. The full instrument has 87 items that measure 29 types of team member contributions with 3 items each. These fall into five categories (contributing to the team's work; interacting with teammates; keeping the team on track; expecting quality; and having relevant knowledge, skills, and abilities). A short version of the instrument has 33 items. Potential uses for the instrument and suggestions for future research are discussed.									41	0	0	3	0	41			0013-1644			WOS:000246447100009

In situ XAS analyses suggest that bis-carbonato inner-sphere and tris-carbonato outer-sphere ternary surface species coexist at the hematite-water interface at pH 7-8.8, and the fraction of outer-sphere species gradually increases from 27 to 54% with increasing pH from 7 to 8.8. The results suggest that the heretofore unknown Np(V)-carbonato ternary surface species may be important in predicting the fate and transport of Np(V) in the subsurface environment down gradient of high-level nuclear waste respositories.									20	2	0	9	0	21			0013-936X			WOS:000246843300020	17612172

Experimental data obtained from an aluminum manufacturing facility indicate significantly less soybean lubricant is required to achieve similar or superior performance. With improved performance and a lower use rate, a transition to soybean oil results in lower aggregate impacts of acidification, smog formation, and human health from criteria pollutants. Regardless of quantity consumed, soybean-based lubricants exhibit significant climate change and fossil fuel use benefits; however, eutrophication impacts are much greater due to non-point nutrient emissions. Fundamental tradeoffs in the carbon and nitrogen cycles are addressed in the analysis, demonstrating that a transition to soybean oil may result in climate change benefits at the expense of regional water quality.									25	0	0	6	0	25			0013-936X			WOS:000246843300051	17612203

While some investigators have examined the influence of organism age on the toxicity of pollutants, the general assumption in toxicology has been that young organisms were more sensitive than older organisms. In fact, some standardized toxicity tests call for the use of organisms less than 24 h old. This research characterized the age sensitivity of the water flea Daphnia magna to copper, zinc, selenium, and arsenic. During 21-d toxicity tests, organisms were exposed to a single 12-h pulse of either 70 mu g/L Cu, 750 mu g/L Zn, 1,000 mu g/L Se, or 5,000 mu g/L As at different ages ranging from 3 h to 10 d old. Mortality and reproduction were compiled over 21 d. During the juvenile stage, mortality increased and cumulative reproduction decreased with age, respectively. However, mortality decreased and cumulative reproduction increased with age when organisms became adult. Peak sensitivity occurred in 4-d-old organisms exposed to Cu and Zn, while 2- to 3-d-old organisms were most sensitive to As and Se. Growth of D. magna over 21 d was not affected by the 12-h pulse of Cu, Zn, Se, or As given at any organism age. This indicates the recovery of the organisms after exposure termination.									14	0	0	12	0	14			0730-7268			WOS:000246581100016	17571686

A was concluded that co-teachers generally supported co-teaching, although a number of important needs were identified, including planning time, student skill level and training; many of these needs were linked to administrative sup port. The dominant co-teaching role was found to be "one teach, one assist," in classrooms characterized by traditional instruction, even though this method is not highly recommended in the literature. The special education teacher was often observed to play a subordinate role. Techniques often recommended for special education teachers, such as peer mediation, strategy instruction, mnemonics, and training of study skills, self-advocacy skills, and self-monitoring, were infrequently observed.									110	0	0	1	2	112			0014-4029			WOS:000247338200003

We have investigated the involvement of the endocannabinoid system in hepatic I/R injury using an in vivo mouse model. Here we report that I/R triggers several-fold increases in the hepatic levels of the endocannabinoids anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol, which originate from hepatocytes, Kupffer, and endothelial cells. The I/R-induced increased tissue endocannabinoid levels positively correlate with the degree of hepatic damage and serum TNF- alpha, MIP- 1 alpha, and MIP- 2 levels. Furthermore, a brief exposure of hepatocytes to various oxidants (H2O2 and peroxynitrite) or inflammatory stimuli (endotoxin and TNF-alpha) also increases endocannabinoid levels. Activation of CB2 cannabinoid receptors by JWH133 protects against I/R damage by decreasing inflammatory cell infiltration, tissue and serum TNF-alpha, MIP-1 alpha and MIP- 2 levels, tissue lipid peroxidation, and expression of adhesion molecule ICAM- 1 in vivo. JWH133 also attenuates the TNF-alpha-induced ICAM-1 and VCAM- 1 expression in human liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (HLSECs) and the adhesion of human neutrophils to HLSECs in vitro. Consistent with the protective role of CB2 receptor activation, CB2-/- mice develop increased I/R-induced tissue damage and proinflammatory phenotype. These findings suggest that oxidative/nitrosative stress and inflammatory stimuli may trigger endocannabinoid production, and indicate that targeting CB2 cannabinoid receptors may represent a novel protective strategy against I/R injury. We also demonstrate that CB2-/- mice have a normal hemodynamic profile.-Batkai, S., Osei-Hyiaman, D., Pan, H., El-Assal, O., Rajesh, M., Mukhopadhyay, P., Hong, F., Harvey-White, J., Jafri, A., Hasko, G., Huffman, J.

Estimating superpopulation size and annual probability of breeding for pond-breeding salamanders								HERPETOLOGICA				63	2			151	162		10.1655/0018-0831(2007)63[151:ESSAAP]2.0.CO;2			JUN 2007	2007	It has long been accepted that amphibians can skip breeding in any given year, and environmental conditions act as a cue for breeding. In this paper, we quantify temporary emigration or nonbreeding probability for mole and spotted salamanders (Ambystoma talpoideum and A. maculatum). We estimated that 70% of mole salamanders may skip breeding during an average rainfall year and 90% may skip during a drought year. Spotted salamanders may be more likely to breed, with only 17% avoiding the breeding pond during an average rainfall year. We illustrate how superpopulations can be estimated using temporary emigration probability estimates. The superpopulation is the total number of salamanders associated with a given breeding pond. Although most salamanders stay within a certain distance of a breeding pond for the majority of their life spans, it is difficult to determine true overall population sizes for a given site if animals are only captured during a brief time frame each year with some animals unavailable for capture at any time during a given year.									10	0	0	9	0	11			0018-0831			WOS:000246628300004

Postemergent annual bluegrass control in dormant nonoverseeded bermudagrass turf								HORTSCIENCE				42	3			670	672					JUN 2007	2007	Annual bluegrass (Poa annua L.) can be a troublesome weed to control in established turfgrass stands; it has developed herbicide resistance after repeated use of products with similar modes of action, and several new herbicides have been registered for use on turfgrasses. Four field studies were conducted near Clemson, S.C., from 2003 through 2005 to evaluate postemergence annual bluegrass control in dormant, nonoverseeded bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.] turf using various herbicides applied in either December or February of each year and rated in the spring. Annual bluegrass control can be accomplished in dormant, nonoverseeded bermudagrass turf using a wide range of products applied in either December or February. Flazasulfuron, foramsulfuron, glufosinate, glufosinate + clethodim, glufosinate + glyphosate, glyphosate + clethodim, glyphosate + diquat, pronamide, rimsulfuron, and trifloxysulfuron provided 87% or greater annual bluegrass control regardless of application timing. Imazaquin and simazine controlled annual bluegrass greater than 85% when applied in December but less than 80% when applied in February. Glyphosate provided 93% annual bluegrass control when applied in February but only 72% control with December applications. No detrimental effects on bermudagrass spring greenup were observed for any herbicide treatment or application time. The availability of several effective herbicide options with differing modes of action provides turfgrass managers with the opportunity to use herbicide rotations that may prevent, or at least delay, the development of resistant annual bluegrass populations to these chemical products.									22	0	0	21	1	22			0018-5345			WOS:000246456600187		
J	McCullough, Patrick E.; Whitwell, Ted; McCarty, Lambert B.; Liu, Haibo								Dwarf bermudagrass tolerance to preemergence herbicides								HORTSCIENCE				42	3			673	677					JUN 2007	2007	Preemergence herbicides are applied to prevent summer annual weed infestations in turf, but safety to dwarf-type bermudagrass golf greens has not been determined for many of these materials. Field experiments tested 'TifEagle' bermudagrass response to bensulide at 11.2 kg.ha(-1) (a.i.), dithiopyr at 0.56 kg.ha(-1) (a.i.) napropamide at 2.2 kg.ha(-1) (a.i.), oxadiazon at 2.2 kg.ha(-1) (a.i.), oxadiazon plus bensulide at 1.7 + 6.7 kg.ha(-1) (a.i.), and pendimethalin at 1.7 kg.ha(-1) (a.i.). All herbicides reduced root mass from the nontreated, but only losses incited by oxadiazon plus bensulide were acceptable (less than 20%). Dithiopyr, napropamide, and pendimethalin delayed spring greenup in 2003 and 2004, whereas oxadiazon plus bensulide delayed spring greenup in 2004. In greenhouse experiments, 'TifEagle' bermudagrass root mass was reduced 19% to 37%, 30% to 33%, 4% to 26%, 28% to 37%, and 24% to 30% from various rates of bensulide, dithiopyr, napropamide, and pendimethalin, respectively. Oxadiazon and oxadiaxon plus bensulide reduced root mass by only 2% to 15% and 15% to 22%, respectively. In another experiment, oxadiazon plus bensulide at 1.7 + 6.7 kg.ha(-1) did not injure shoots or roots of 'Champion', 'FloraDwarf, 'MiniVerde', 'Tifdwarf, or 'TifEagle' bermudagrass. Overall, dwarf-type bermudagrass golf greens do not appear to tolerate mitotic inhibitor preemergence herbicides, whereas oxadiazon or oxadiazon plus bensulide caused minimal injury.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0018-5345			WOS:000246456600188

Influence of fertility and mowing height on performance of established centipedegrass								HORTSCIENCE				42	3			678	681					JUN 2007	2007	Centipedegrass [Eremochloa ophiuroides (Munro) Hack.] is widely grown throughout the southeastern United States as a low-maintenance turfgrass; however, limited peer-reviewed research is available on "best" cultural practices for established centipedegrass. This research was conducted to examine the long-term effects of mowing height and fertility regimens providing various rates and application times of soil-applied granular Fe and N on centipedegrass quality and surface coverage. Soil type was a Cecil sandy loam (clayey, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Hapludult) with a pH of 5.5. A mowing height of 3.8 cm was equal to or better than the 1.9 cm mowing height throughout the study. The rate of N fertilization played an important role in achieving optimal turfgrass quality and coverage with the two highest rates (97.6 and 195.2 kg.ha(-1) N), generally providing similar results when applied as split applications in May and August and mowed at 3.8 cm. These treatments provided turfgrass quality ratings of 8.3-9.0, turfgrass color ratings of 8.1-8.7, and turfgrass coverage of 94% to 98% over a 3-year period. The addition of soil-applied Fe sulfate at a rate of 24.4 kg.ha(-1) Fe was not beneficial to centipedegrass performance or color. Results indicate that the addition of 97.6 kg.ha(-1) N, using split-applications in May and August and a mowing height of 3.8 cm for established centipedegrass, should achieve acceptable turfgrass quality and coverage.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0018-5345			WOS:000246456600189		
J	Molz, Fred J.; Kozubowski, Tomasz J.; Podgorski, Krzysztof; Castle, James W.								A generalization of the fractal/facies model								HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL				15	4			809	816		10.1007/s10040-006-0154-9			JUN 2007	2007	In order to generalize the fractal/facies concept, a new stochastic fractal model for ln(K) increment probability density functions (PDFs) is presented that produces non-Gaussian behavior at smaller lags and converges to Gaussian at larger lags. The model is based on the classical Laplace PDF. The new stochastic fractal family is called fractional Laplace motion (fLam) having stationary increments called fractional Laplace noise (fLan). This fractal is different from other fractals because the character of the underlying increment PDFs changes dramatically with lag size, which leads to lack of self-similarity. Data also appear to display this characteristic. In the larger lag size ranges, approximate self-affinity does hold. The basic field procedure for further testing of the fractional Laplace theory is to measure ln(K) increment distributions along transects, calculate frequency distributions from the data, and compare results to appropriate fLan family members. The variances of the frequency distributions should also change with lag size (scale) in a prescribed manner. There are mathematical reasons such as the geometric central limit theorem, for surmising that fLam/fLan may be more fundamental than other approaches that have been proposed for modeling ln(K) frequency distributions.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1431-2174			WOS:000247338300015

We tested our model using respondents who participated in virtual teams during a 16-week period. Our findings suggested that Internet anxiety was affected both by the users' personality and by beliefs that can be influenced by providing adequate resources to support the technology, encourage trust in technology, and working to assure users that leaders and peers are supportive of their using the technology. Our findings suggest that by providing appropriate resources and fostering a supportive environment, leaders could reduce Internet anxiety and thus influence the use of technology in the workplace in ways that benefit organizations.

However, despite their importance only several 3D structures were experimentally determined in contrast to the wealth of sequences available for each of the NMPK families. To fill this gap we present a Web-based database containing structural models for all proteins of the five bacterial nucleoside monophosphate kinase (bNMPK) families. The models were computed by means of homology-based approach using a few experimentally determined bNMPK structures. The database also contains pK(a) values and their components calculated for the homology-based 3D models, which is a unique feature of the database. The BActerial Nucleoside MOnophosphate, Klnases (BANMOKI) database is freely accessible (http://www.ces.clemson.edu/compbio/banmoki) and offers an easy. user-friendly interface for browsing, searching and downloading content of the database. The users can investigate, using the searching tools of the database, the properties of the bNMP kinases in respect to sequence composition, electrostatic interactions and structural differences.

J	Xie, De; Biggers, Sherrill B., Jr.								Calculation of transient strain energy release rates under impact loading based on the virtual crack closure technique								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMPACT ENGINEERING				34	6			1047	1060		10.1016/j.ijimpeng.2006.02.007			JUN 2007	2007	This paper describes an interface element to calculate the strain energy release rates based on the virtual crack closure technique (VCCT) in conjunction with finite element analysis (FEA). A very stiff spring is placed between the node pair at the crack tip to calculate the nodal forces. Dummy nodes are introduced to extract information for displacement openings behind the crack tip and the virtual crack jump ahead of the crack tip. This interface element leads to a direct calculation of the strain energy release rate (both components G(I) and G(II)) within a finite element analysis without extra post-processing. Several examples of stationary cracks under impact loading were examined. Dynamic stress intensity factors were converted from the calculated transient strain energy release rate for comparison with the available solutions by the others from numerical and experimental methods. The accuracy of the element is validated by the excellent agreement with these solutions. No convergence difficulty has been encountered for all the cases studied. Neither special singular elements nor the collapsed element technique is used at the crack tip. Therefore, the fracture interface element for VCCT is shown to be simple, efficient and robust in analyzing crack response to the dynamic loading. This element has been implemented into commercial FEA software ABAQUS(R) with the user defined element (UEL) and should be very useful in performing fracture analysis at a structural level by engineers using ABAQUS(R).

J	Kovach, Jami; Cho, Byung Rae								Development of a D-optimal robust design model for restricted experiments								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING-THEORY APPLICATIONS AND PRACTICE				14	2			117	128					JUN 2007	2007	The well-known quality improvement methodology, robust design, is a powerful and cost-effective technique for improving performance measures, which focuses on building quality into the design of products and processes. Although several approaches to robust design have been proposed in the literature, little attention has been given to the use of robust design when experiments are subject to physical restrictions and constraints, which occurs frequently in today's complex manufacturing processes. When such a situation arises, experimental design techniques traditionally used in robust design may no longer be appropriate. A logical alternative to this problem is the use of computer-generated designs, specifically D-optimal designs. In this paper, we propose a new design methodology called D-optimal robust design. A numerical example is used to show the proposed procedure, and the results determined from our proposed model are compared to those obtained by the robust design approaches previously developed.									8	0	0	0	0	8			1072-4761			WOS:000248703100002

The four treatments for anti-drunk driving advertisements include employing truth in advertising, implicature, actor portrayal disclosure, and deceptive (withholding information) advertising. We find that the use of real victims in print ad PSAs garners the strongest emotional response, the most positive attitude toward the advertisement, the strongest perceived social responsibility, and the highest proclivity to donate to the nonprofit. Conversely, the use of deceptive advertising is not significantly different from using an actor portrayal disclosure as regards perceived social responsibility and emotional response to the ad. Our findings suggest that the us of real victims in PSAs demonstrates socially responsible behavior by the nonprofit organization.									12	0	0	0	0	12			0091-3367			WOS:000247170300003

Effects of supplemental rumen-protected conjugated linoleic acid or corn oil on lipid content and palatability in beef cattle								JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE				85	6			1504	1510		10.2527/jas.2006-581			JUN 2007	2007	Thirty-six Angus x Hereford heifers were used in a 3 x 2 factorial (3 dietary treatments; 2 supplementation times) to examine the effect of dietary lipid supplementation on lipid oxidation, lipid composition, and palatability of ribeye steaks and ground beef. Lipid was supplied in the diets as corn oil or a partially rumen-protected CLA salt for 2 specific treatment periods of the final 32 or 60 d on feed, corresponding to a total time on feed of 89 or 118 d. After an initial 56-d feeding period (basal diet), the heifers were fed I of 3 dietary treatments (DM basis): 1) a basal diet containing 88% concentrate and 12% grass hay (CON), 2) the basal diet plus 4% corn oil (OIL), or 3) the basal diet plus 2% partially rumen-protected CLA (RPCLA) containing 31% CLA. Heifers were randomly allotted to dietary treatments at the initiation of the study and fed individually. At 48 h postmortem, the right forequarter of each carcass was fabricated into retail cuts. Steaks (2.54-cm thick) were obtained from the posterior end of the ribeye roll (NAMP 112), and beef trim was ground for all subsequent analyses. Dietary treatment did not affect (P > 0.05) lipid oxidation in ground beef or ribeye steaks. Total trans-octadecenoate fat and trans-10 octadecenoic acid content in ribeye steaks increased (P < 0.05) with RPCLA compared with CON. Total CLA and the cis-9 trans-11 isomer of CLA contents in ribeye steaks were unchanged (P > 0.05) by lipid supplementation. In ground beef, RPCLA supplementation increased (P < 0.05) the amount of trans fat and trans-10 octadecenoic acid compared with CON or OIL; supplementation of RPCLA increased (P < 0.05) the amount of CLA cis-9 trans-11 isomer and total CLA. Lipid supplementation did not alter (P > 0.05) off-flavor ratings in ground beef or ribeye steaks. Supplementation of corn oil increased (P < 0.05) total PUFA content of ribeye steaks compared with CON and RPCLA. Dietary RPCLA supplementation increased the amount of trans fat per serving (85.5 g, broiled) by 110 and 88% in ribeye steak and ground beef, respectively, and CLA cis-9 trans-11 by 58% in ground beef compared with CON. Supplementing OIL or RPCLA resulted in minimal changes in lipid oxidation and sensory attributes of steaks and ground beef.									14	0	0	11	0	14			0021-8812			WOS:000246523700018	17339415

The methods examined include the standard normal homogeneity (SNH) test, Wilcoxon's nonparametric test, two-phase regression (TPR) procedures, inhomogeneity tests, information criteria procedures, and various variants thereof. All of these methods have been proposed in the climate literature to detect undocumented changepoints, but heretofore there has been little formal comparison of the techniques on either real or simulated climate series. This study seeks to unify the topic, showing clearly the fundamental differences among the assumptions made by each procedure and providing guidelines for which procedures work best in different situations. It is shown that the common trend TPR and Sawa's Bayes criteria procedures seem optimal for most climate time series, whereas the SNH procedure and its nonparametric variant are probably best when trend and periodic effects can be diminished by using homogeneous reference series. Two applications to annual mean temperature series are given. Directions for future research are discussed.									144	3	0	18	2	147			1558-8424	1558-8432		WOS:000247718400014

However, coating or impregnation of hydrophobic fibrous materials with these liquids is difficult to achieve. In this paper, we consider electrowetting phenomenon as a promising method to fill the materials with nonwetting liquids. Theoretical models demonstrate the effect of applied electric field on impregnation efficiency. Planar fibrous sheets and yarns with interlaced wires are theoretically considered as examples of typical fibrous materials. We estimate the electric field needed to pull the liquid into the pores. Kinetics of forced impregnation into yarns is shown to be faster as compared to planar materials. (c) 2007 American Institute of Physics.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-8979			WOS:000247306000159

Journal of bioinformatics and computational biology				5	3			693	715		10.1142/S0219720007002709			2007-Jun	2007	In this study, we address the issue of performing meaningful pK(a) calculations using homology modeled three-dimensional (3D) structures and analyze the possibility of using the calculated pK(a) values to detect structural defects in the models. For this purpose, the 3D structure of each member of five large protein families of a bacterial nucleoside monophosphate kinases (NMPK) have been modeled by means of homology-based approach. Further, we performed pK(a) calculations for the each model and for the template X-ray structures. Each bacterial NMPK family used in the study comprised on average 100 members providing a pool of sequences and 3D models large enough for reliable statistical analysis. It was shown that pK(a) values of titratable groups, which are highly conserved within a family, tend to be conserved among the models too. We demonstrated that homology modeled structures with sequence identity larger than 35% and gap percentile smaller than 10% can be used for meaningful pK(a) calculations. In addition, it was found that some highly conserved titratable groups either exhibit large pK(a) fluctuations among the models or have pK(a) values shifted by several pH units with respect to the pK(a) calculated for the X-ray structure. We demonstrated that such case usually indicates structural errors associated with the model. Thus, we argue that pK(a) calculations can be used for assessing the quality of the 3D models by monitoring fluctuations of the pK(a) values for highly conserved titratable residues within large sets of homologous proteins.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0219-7200			MEDLINE:17688312	17688312

L. monocytogenes Scott A labeled with green fluorescent protein (GFP) was grown on glass slide to form a mono-species biofilm, or co-cultured with Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 to form a two-species biofilm. The anti-L. monocytogenes-coated nanoparticles specifically recognized L. monocytogenes in monospecies biofilms. However, under the same confocal laser scanning microscopy conditions, anti-L. monocytogenes-nano particles generated higher intensity of fluorescent signals, which ranged from 0 to 4000, than anti-L. monocytogenes alone did, which was in the range of 0 to 250. In two-species biofilms, L. monocytogenes cells at different depths (0-5 mu m) of biofilms were successfully detected by both nanoparticle-based indirect immunoassay and fluorescent nanoparticle-based direct immunoassay but not traditional immunoassay. The results demonstrate that these nanoparticle-based immunoassays were more sensitive than traditional immunoassays for detecting L. monocytogenes in mono- or two-species biofilms.									12	0	0	4	0	12			1550-7033			WOS:000247404300004

After transfection, the expression of cartilage-specific extracellular matrix was upregulated, whereas matrix metalloproteinases I and 3 (NIMP I and 3) protein expressions and enzymatic activities were downregulated. Autologous MSCs modified with the TGF-beta 1 gene were seeded into chitosan scaffolds to construct gene-modified cartilage, which was then implanted into the full-thickness articular cartilage defects of rabbits' knees. Twelve weeks after implantation, the defects were filled with regenerated hyaline-like cartilage tissue as confirmed by the positive immunohistochemical staining of collagen type 11 and intense toluidine blue staining of proteoglycan. Our findings suggest that the repair of cartilage defects can be enhanced by TGF-beta 1 gene-modified-tissue engineering of cartilage on the basis of a strategy using MSCs, chitosan, and liposomal transfection.									40	10	0	32	1	50			1389-1723			WOS:000248957300008	17630127

Periostin regulates collagen fibrillogenesis and the biomechanical properties of connective tissues								JOURNAL OF CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY				101	3			695	711		10.1002/jcb.21224			JUN 1 2007	2007	Periostin is predominantly expressed in collagen-rich fibrous connective tissues that are subjected to constant mechanical stresses including: heart valves, tendons, perichondrium, cornea, and the periodontal ligament (PDL). Based on these data we hypothesize that periostin can regulate collagen I fibrillogenesis and thereby affect the biomechanical properties of connective tissues. Immunoprecipitation and immunogold transmission electron microscopy experiments demonstrate that periostin is capable of directly interacting with collagen I. To analyze the potential role of periostin in collagen I fibrillogenesis, gene targeted mice were generated. Transmission electron microscopy and morphometric analyses demonstrated reduced collagen fibril diameters in skin dermis of periostin knockout mice, an indication of aberrant collagen I fibrillogenesis. In addition, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) demonstrated a lower collagen denaturing temperature in periostin knockout mice, reflecting a reduced level of collagen cross-linking. Functional biomechanical properties of periostin null skin specimens and atrioventricular (AV) valve explant experiments provided direct evidence of the role that periostin plays in regulating the viscoelastic properties of connective tissues. Collectively, these data demonstrate for the first time that periostin can regulate collagen I fibrillogenesis and thereby serves as an important mediator of the biomechanical properties of fibrous connective tissues.									237	14	0	209	0	253			0730-2312			WOS:000246123400016	17226767

Our methodology results in state estimates similar to those reported in the United States Census from 2000 back to 1940 and national, turn of the century estimates strikingly close to those presented by Schultz (Schultz, T. (1961). In N. B. Henry (Ed.), Social forces influencing American education. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.) and Fishlow (Fishlow, A. (1966). In H. Rosovsky (Ed.), Industrialization in two systems. John Wiley & Sons). To further determine the validity of our state schooling estimates, we first combine original data on real state per worker output with existing data to provide a more comprehensive series of real state output per worker from 1840 to 2000. We then estimate aggregate Mincerian earnings regressions and discover that the return to a year of schooling for the average individual in a state ranges from 11% to 15%. This range is robust to various time periods, various estimation methods, various assumptions about the endogeneity of schooling and is in line with the body of evidence from the labor literature.									17	0	0	1	0	17			1381-4338			WOS:000247414800002

The influence of financial incentive programs in promoting sustainable forestry on the nation's family forests								JOURNAL OF FORESTRY				105	4			184	191					JUN 2007	2007	Financial incentive programs were evaluated to assess their contribution to promoting sustainable forestry practices on the nation's family forests. The evaluation consisted of an extensive review of the literature on financial incentive programs, a mail survey of the lead administrator of financial incentive programs in each state forestry agency, and focus groups with family forest owners in four regions of the country. The study found that financial incentive programs have limited influence on forest owners' decisions regarding the management and use of their land. Family forest owners viewed one-on-one access to a forester or other natural resource professional to "walk the land" with them and discuss their management alternatives as the most important type of assistance that can be provided. Recommendations for increasing the effectiveness of financial incentive programs in promoting sustainable forestry are discussed.									49	1	0	25	0	52			0022-1201			WOS:000247453500009

In this paper a simplified semiempirical model is proposed for predicting maximum wall deflection, maximum surface settlement, and surface- settlement profile due to excavations in soft to inedium clays. A large number of artificial data are generated through finite-element analyses using a well-calibrated, small-strain soil model. These data, consisting of wall displacements and ground-surface settlements in simulated excavations in soft to medium clays, provide the basis for developing the proposed semiempirical model. The proposed model is verified using case histories not used in the development of the model. The study shows that the developed model can accurately predict maximum wall deflection and ground-surface settlement caused by braced excavations in soft to medium clays.									55	9	0	0	0	62			1090-0241			WOS:000247671600011

Hsein								Rutting resistance of rubberized asphalt concrete pavements containing reclaimed asphalt pavement mixtures								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING				19	6			475	483		10.1061/(ASCE)0899-1561(2007)19:6(475)			JUN 2007	2007	Improved understanding of rutting resistance of a rubberized asphalt concrete pavement that contains reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) is important to stimulating the use of rubberized asphalt mixtures. Use of RAP in the past has proved to be economical, environmentally sound, and effective in increasing the rutting resistance of asphalt mixtures. Rubberized asphalt has been used successfully in improving the mechanical characteristics, such as rutting resistance, of typical hot mix asphalt (HMA) mixture around the country and the world. The objective of this research was to investigate the rutting resistance characteristics of the rubberized asphalt mixtures through a laboratory testing program. The experimental design included use of two rubber types (ambient and cryogenically produced), four rubber contents, and three crumb rubber sizes. The results of the experiments indicated that the use of RAP and crumb rubber in the HMA can effectively improve the rut resistance of these mixes.									83	5	0	0	0	87			0899-1561			WOS:000246876500005		
J	Shen, Junan; Amirkhanian, Serji N.; Lee, Soon-Jae								HP-GPC characterization of rejuvenated aged CRM binders								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING				19	6			515	522		10.1061/(ASCE)0899-1561(2007)19:6(515)			JUN 2007	2007	The recycling of reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) is typically achieved by adding a rejuvenating agent into the mix. The addition of the rejuvenating agent leads to adjusting the compositions and consequently improving the physical and performance properties of the rejuvenated aged binders in the RAP. Many rubberized pavements, around the country, are over 15 years old and some of them are a candidate for recycling. Therefore, there is a need to study the effects of rejuvenating agents on aged crumb rubber modified binders (CRM binders). This paper presents a study characterizing the blends of laboratory-aged CRM binders and rejuvenating agents using gel permeation chromatography (GPC), resulting in the development of empirical models to predict selected properties of the blends. Three aged CRM binders and two aged control binders (PG 76-22) were mixed with either a rejuvenator or a softer binder at different concentrations to determine the influence of the various asphalt binders and the rejuvenating agents on the chromatographic profiles. The results indicated the compositional changes of the blends containing various percentages of either the rejuvenator or the softer binder are well reflected by the GPC profiles. The large molecular size (LMS) of the blends decreased and the small molecular size (SMS) increased as the percentage of the rejuvenator agents increased regardless of the type of aged binders or the rejuvenating agents. The empirical prediction models for Superpave binder properties (viscosity and high-failure temperature) were developed using LMS and SMS. The predicted values showed a high correlation with the viscosity and the high-failure temperature of binders.									20	0	0	0	1	21			0899-1561			WOS:000246876500010

Cuneyt/B-1966-2008				A protocol to develop crack-free biomimetic coatings on Ti6Al4V substrates								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS RESEARCH				22	6			1593	1600		10.1557/JMR.2007.0193			JUN 2007	2007	Biomimetic coating of titanium and related alloys with carbonated apatitic calcium phosphate is an important area of research in implantology. While this paper specifically refers to coating Ti6Al4V, the results are valid with other related alloys as well. One step in the protocol involves an intermediate alkali treatment of Ti6Al4V to form a sodium titanate layer on the alloy surface. This pretreatment enhances the formation of the coating from simulated body fluid (SBF) solutions. Many papers in the biomimetic coating literature demonstrate the presence of cracks in coatings, irrespective of the SBF compositions and placement of the substrates. The presence of cracks may result in degradation and delamination of coatings. To the best of our knowledge, this issue remains unresolved. Therefore, the aim of this study was: (i) to examine and understand the reasons for cracking and (ii) based on the results, to develop a protocol for producing crack-free apatitic calcium phosphate coatings on Ti6Al4V substrates. In this study, the authors focused their attention on the alkali treatment procedure and the final drying step. It is hypothesized that these two steps of the process affect the crack formation the most. In the first case, the surfaces of alkali-treated substrates were examined with/without water-soaking treatment before immersing in SBF. This water treatment modifies the sodium titanate surface layer. In the second case, two different drying techniques (after soaking in SBF) were used. In one procedure, the coated substrates were dried rapidly, and in the other they were dried slowly. It was observed that the water treatment, irrespective of the drying method, provides a surface, which on subsequent soaking in SBF forms a crack-free apatitic calcium phosphate coating. Based on these results, the authors suggest a protocol incorporating a water-soaking treatment after the alkali treatment and prior to the SBF soaking treatment to obtain crack-free coatings.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0884-2914			WOS:000247053600019

BODA monomers undergo thermal step-growth polymerization to reactive and processable branched polyarylene intermediates. Well-defined intermediates with controlled conversion, molecular weight and viscosity, along with solution or melt processing allow for control in ultimate carbon structure. Fabrication followed by thermal cure and carbonization results in solid or hollow carbon fiber prototypes with interesting thermal and electrical properties. The BODA polymerization and fiber formation were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry, and gel permeation chromatography. The thermal behavior and stability of fibers was measured by thermogravimetric analysis. The surface crystallinity of fibers was studied by Raman spectroscopy. The conductivity of fibers was measured by a multimeter. The surface morphology and dimensions of the fibers were examined by scanning electron microscopy.									9	0	0	1	0	9			0022-2461			WOS:000247402300028

Micro-mechanics based derivation of the materials constitutive relations for carbon-nanotube reinforced poly-vinyl-ester-epoxy based composites								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE				42	12			4609	4623		10.1007/s10853-006-0520-y			JUN 2007	2007	The atomic-level computational results of the mechanical properties of Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotube (MWCNT) reinforced poly-vinyl-esterepoxy obtained in our recent work [Grujicic M, Sun Y-P, Koudela KL (2006) Appl Surf Sci (accepted for publication, March)], have been utilized in the present work within a continuum-based micro-mechanics formulation to determine the effective macroscopic mechanical properties of these materials. Since the MWCNT reinforcements and the polymer-matrix molecules are of comparable length scales, the reinforcement/matrix interactions which control the matrix-to-reinforcement load transfer in these materials are accounted for through direct atomic-level modeling of the "effective reinforcement" mechanical properties. The term an "effective reinforcement" is used to denote a MWCNT surrounded by a layer of the polymer matrix whose thickness is comparable to the MWCNT radius and whose conformation is changed as a result of its interactions with the MWCNT. The micromechanics procedure yielded the effective continuum mechanical properties for the MWCNT-reinforced poly-vinyl-ester-epoxy matrix composite mats with a random in-plane orientation of the MWCNTs as a function of the following composite microstructural parameters: the volume fraction of the MWCNTs, their aspect ratio, the extent of covalent functionalization of the MWCNT outer walls as well as a function of the mechanical properties of the matrix and the reinforcements.									10	0	0	0	0	10			0022-2461			WOS:000247402300061		
J	Menor, Larry J.; Roth, Aleda V.								New service development competence in retail banking: Construct development and measurement validation								JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT				25	4			825	846		10.1016/j.jom.2006.07.004			JUN 2007	2007	New service development (NSD) has emerged as an important area of research in service operations management. However, NSD empirical investigations have been hindered by the lack of psychometrically sound measurement items and scales. This paper reports a two-stage approach for the development and validation of new multi-item measurement scales reflecting a multidimensional construct called NSD competence. NSD competence reflects an organization's expertise in deploying resources and routines, usually in combination, to achieve a desired new service outcome. This competence is operationalized as a multidimensional construct reflected by five complementary dimensions: NSD process focus, market acuity, NSD strategy, NSD culture, and information technology experience. In the first stage of measure development, we analyse judgment-based, nominal-scaled data collected through an iterative item-sorting process to assess the tentative reliability and validity of the proposed measurement items. Our results demonstrate that a reduced set of measurement items have reasonable psychometric properties and, therefore, are useful inputs for multi-item measurement scale development. In the second stage of measurement development, we conduct a confirmatory factor analysis of the five NSD competence dimensions using survey data collected from a sample of retail bank key informants and confirm the unidimensionality, reliability, and validity of the proposed five multi-item scales. The NSD competence scales developed in this research may be used to advance scholarly understanding and theory in NSD. Further, these NSD scales may provide a useful diagnostic and benchmarking tool for managers seeking to assess and/or improve their firm's service innovation expertise. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Hydrophilization of polypropylene films by using migratory additives								JOURNAL OF VINYL & ADDITIVE TECHNOLOGY				13	2			57	64		10.1002/vnl.20102			JUN 2007	2007	Linear and branched hydrophilic additives of various molecular weights (MWs) were extruded with polypropylene (PP) to make blend films. The surface-modifying additives included polyethylene glycol (PEG), hydroxylterminated four-arm polyethylene oxide (PEO), and a commercial hydrophilic additive, Irgasurf HL560. Films were extruded by using a twin-screw microcompounder at 200 degrees C, and the resulting film thickness was 100 pm. Attenuated total reflectance (ATR)-FTIR spectrometry and water contact angle measurements were performed on the film surfaces over time to investigate the additive migration behavior. Although ATR-FTIR detected concentration increases for all additives in the subsurface region, there was no significant improvement in surface hydrophilicity for the PEGs and four-arm PEOs in the same period of time as water contact angles were measured on the surfaces. Among the linear additives, low MW PEG (1 kDa) was found to migrate faster than the high MW varieties. The linear PEG and four-arm PEO with MW higher than 2 kDa did not exhibit significant migration to the surface within a month. Irgasurf was found to change the surface wettability effectively in a relatively short time.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1083-5601			WOS:000246951400003

The luminescence of the rare earth (RE)-doped SiO2 particles has been studied as a function of the nature of the RE, their concentration and also of the presence of An nanoparticles at the surface of the SiO2 nanoparticles. We have shown that the Eu3+ emission is observable over the experimental conditions examined, whereas it was not possible to observe any emission for Dy3+ doped materials. No enhancement of the Eu3+ emission was observed following the adsorption of gold nanoparticles at the surface of the SiO2 nanoparticle, however an excitation at 250 nm leads to both the emission of the matrix and Eu3+ showing an energy transfer from the SiO2 matrix to Eu3+ ions.

J	Keinath, Anthony P.								Sensitivity of populations of Phytophthora capsici from South Carolina to mefenoxam, dimethomorph, zoxamide, and cymoxanil								PLANT DISEASE				91	6			743	748		10.1094/PDIS-91-6-0743			JUN 2007	2007	In summer and fall 2003, Phytophthora blight and crown rot, caused by Phytophthora capsici, was found in three fields each of summer squash and pepper on three farms in two counties in South Carolina. Although this disease had been confirmed previously in the state, five of these outbreaks were in fields thought to be free of P. capsici. The objectives of this study were to determine whether isolates of P. capsici in South Carolina were sensitive to mefenoxam and to determine baseline sensitivities to dimethomorph, zoxamide, and cymoxanil, fungicides recently registered to control Phytophthora blight. Of 120 isolates tested for sensitivity to mefenoxam at 100 mg/liter, 8 isolates were resistant (relative colony diameter [RCD] > 90% of nonamended control), 60 isolates were sensitive (RCD < 30%), and 52 isolates were intermediately sensitive. Only sensitive isolates were found in two fields in which no mefenoxam-containing fungicides had ever been used. Intermediately sensitive or resistant isolates were found in the four fields in which mefenoxam had been applied previously. In all, 15 to 61 isolates were tested for sensitivity to dimethomorph, zoxamide, and cymoxanil. The concentrations at which RCD, percent cyst germination, and relative zoospore production were reduced to 50% (EC50 values) for mycelial growth were 0.19 +/- 0.02 ( standard deviation) mg/liter for dimethomorph, 0.50 +/- 0.50 mg/liter for zoxamide, and mostly > 50 mg/liter for cymoxanil. EC50 values for zoospore cyst germination were 0.07 +/- 0.02 mg/liter for dimethomorph and > 50 mg/liter for cymoxanil. EC50 values for zoospore production were 0.63 +/- 0.42 mg/liter for dimethomorph, 0.47 +/- 0.51 mg/liter for zoxamide, and < 50 mg/liter for cymoxanil. Sensitivity values obtained in this South Carolina study can be used as a comparative baseline to monitor shifts in sensitivity to the fungicides mefenoxam, dimethomorph, zoxamide, and cymoxanil in populations of P. capsici.									30	9	0	31	0	40			0191-2917			WOS:000246590900013		
J	Gilles, Gregory J.; Hines, Kelly M.; Manfre, Alicia J.; Marcotte, William R., Jr.								A predicted N-terminal helical domain of a Group 1 LEA protein is required for protection of enzyme activity from drying								PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY				45	6-7			389	399		10.1016/j.plaphy.2007.03.027			JUN-JUL 2007	2007	Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins have been repeatedly implicated in the acquisition of desiccation tolerance in angiosperm seed embryos. However, the mechanism(s) by which protection occurs is not well understood. While the Group I LEA proteins are predicted to be largely unordered in solution, there is strong evidence that upon drying these proteins undergo a structural transition that leads to an increase in a-helical content. Several studies also suggest there is a direct interaction between Group I LEA proteins and other molecules in the cytoplasm that may be critical for the establishment of desiccation tolerance during embryo maturation. We have produced a recombinant Group I LEA protein and show that it is capable of protecting the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase from the deleterious effects of drying. We have also evaluated the ability of various altered recombinant Group I LEA proteins to protect in the same assay. Our results suggest that the highly conserved 20 amino acid Group I LEA signature motif is not required for protection in our in vitro assay. However, introduction of two juxtaposed proline residues into an N-terminal helical domain predicted to exist in the hydrated structure significantly compromises the ability of the recombinant protein to provide protection from drying. These results suggest that the N-terminal domain of Group I LEA proteins may be important for proper folding during dehydration. (C) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Diurnal carbohydrate dynamics affect postharvest ethylene responsiveness in portulaca (Portulaca grandiflora 'Yubi Deep Rose') unrooted cuttings								POSTHARVEST BIOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY				44	3			293	299		10.1016/j.postharvbio.2006.12.004			JUN 2007	2007	Portulaca (Portulaca grandiflora) is an herbaceous ornamental annual plant that is commonly propagated by shoot-tip cuttings and shipped long distances before they are rooted in greenhouses. During transit and rooting, a significant number of leaves usually abscise, which delays or prevents subsequent rooting. We investigated the effect of preharvest diurnal carbohydrate dynamics on postharvest performance of unrooted shoot-tip cuttings of portulaca 'Yubi Deep Rose'. The production of ethylene was quantified, as well as the efficacy of 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) to improve the postharvest performance. The initial carbohydrate concentrations in cuttings increased with later harvest during the day (8 a.m., 12 p.m., and 4 p.m.). When cuttings were placed into a dark postharvest environment at 20 +/- 1 degrees C for 48 h, cuttings harvested at 8 a.m. had complete leaf abscission, whereas only partial leaf abscission was observed in cuttings harvested at 12 p.m. and 4 p.m. Leaf abscission was negatively correlated with preharvest leaf carbohydrate and stem starch concentrations, but not significantly correlated with postharvest ethylene production during storage. Application of 1-MCP improved the storage quality of cuttings, irrespective of the time of cutting harvest, and did not inhibit the rooting response during subsequent propagation. Collectively, these results indicate that with the increase in preharvest endogenous carbohydrate levels of portulaca cuttings, as the photoperiod progresses, subsequent postharvest ethylene responsiveness decreases, but there is no effect on ethylene synthesis.

J	Fortney, Patrick J.								Seismic performance evaluation of coupled core walls with concrete and steel coupling beams								Steel and Composite Structures, An International Journal				7	4			279	301					2007	2007	When coupling beams are proportioned appropriately in coupled core wall (CCW) systems, theinput energy from ground motions is dissipated primarily through inelastic deformations in plastic hingeregions at the ends of the coupling beams. It is desirable that the plastic hinges form at the beam ends whilethe base wall piers remain elastic. The strength and stiffness of the coupling beams are, therefore, crucial if thedesired global behavior of the CCW system is to be achieved. This paper presents the results of nonlinearresponse history analysis of two 20-story CCW buildings. Both buildings have the same geometric dimensions,and the components of the buildings are designed based on the equivalent lateral force procedure. However, onebuilding is fitted with steel coupling beams while the other is fitted with diagonally reinforced concretecoupling beams. The force-deflection relationships of both beams are based on experimental data, while themoment-curvature and axial load-moment relationships of the wall piers are analytically generated from crosssectionalfiber analyses. Using the aforementioned beam and wall properties, nonlinear response historyanalyses are performed. Superiority of the steel coupling beams is demonstrated through detailed evaluationsof local and global responses computed for a number of recorded and artificially generated ground motions.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1229-9367			KJD:ART001475000

Demonstration of optimizing piezoelectric polarization in the design of a flextensional actuator								STRUCTURAL AND MULTIDISCIPLINARY OPTIMIZATION				33	6			471	480		10.1007/s00158-006-0052-8			JUN 2007	2007	Much effort has gone into amplifying the displacements of actuators built around piezoelectric materials (PZTs). Some researchers have used topology optimization to design compliant mechanisms that best magnify either the geometric or mechanical advantage of piezoelectric wafers or "stack" actuators. PZTs are generally poled through the "thin" direction, so actuation by an electric field in that direction only induces eigenstrains normal to the free edges. Some researchers have shown advantages of "shear mode" actuation, and material scientists have demonstrated the ability to pole a PZT in an arbitrary direction. This work attempts to justify the inclusion of the PZT polarization vector as a design variable in the design of a flextensional actuator. We present two examples based on the "cymbal" actuator: one using a simplified model to justify off-angle polarization and another using the polarization vector as a design variable to optimize the topology of a compliant mechanism.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1615-147X			WOS:000246521500004

To demonstrate unintentional interpretation, I showed a brief ambiguous video clip and asked students to write descriptions of what they saw and heard. When students evaluated their responses, they discovered that 96% of the class wrote interpretations rather than strictly factual descriptions. Furthermore, the content of students' interpretations varied widely. Analyses of a qualitative measure of 3 dimensions of student learning (subsequent behavior, success at articulating the purpose of the exercise, and self-reported personal impact) supported the effectiveness of this exercise in increasing students' understanding of unintentional interpretation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0098-6283			WOS:000249451500004

Short-term response of shrews to prescribed fire and mechanical fuel reduction in a Southern Appalachian upland hardwood forest								FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT				243	2-3			231	236		10.1016/j.foreco.2007.03.003			MAY 31 2007	2007	As part of the multidisciplinary National Fire and Fire Surrogate study, we used drift fences with pitfall traps from May to September 2003 and 2004 to determine how three fuel reduction techniques affected shrews in the Southern Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina. Ground-dwelling macroarthropods also were collected from a subset of pitfall traps to assess relative prey availability among the treatments. Four experimental units, each > 14 ha were contained within each of three replicate blocks. Treatments were (1) prescribed burning; (2) mechanical felling of shrubs and small trees; (3) mechanical felling + burning; (4) forested controls. Mechanical understory felling treatments were conducted in winter 2001-2002, and prescribed burning was conducted in March 2003. High-intensity fires and high tree mortality increased canopy openness in mechanical felling + burn treatment compared to the others. Burning reduced leaf litter depth in both the burned treatments (burn only and mechanical felling + burn), whereas mechanical understory felling alone increased leaf litter depth in that treatment. Dry biomass of ground-dwelling macroarthropods was similar among the treatments and control. We collected a total of 269 shrews of four species during 2003 and 2004, including northern short-tailed shrews (Blarina brevicauda), smokey shrews (Sorex fumeus), pygmy shrews (S. hoyi), and southeastern shrews (S. longirostris). Relative abundance of all shrews combined and pygmy shrews was lowest in the mechanical felling + burn treatment, but differed significantly only from the mechanical understory felling treatment where the contrast in leaf litter depth was high. Our results indicate that low-intensity fuel reduction treatments, with minimal change to canopy cover or leaf litter depth, have little impact on shrews. However, high-intensity disturbance, such as prescribed burning that kills trees and dramatically reduces shade and leaf litter depth, can reduce the abundance of some shrew species and all shrews combined, at least in the short term.

This difference indicates that the oldest solar system planetesimals formed in the absence of Fe-60. Evidence for live Fe-60 in younger objects suggests that Fe-60 was injected into the protoplanetary disk similar to 1 million years after solar system formation, when Al-26 was already homogeneously distributed. Decoupling the first appearance of Al-26 and Fe-60 constrains the environment where the Sun's formation could have taken place, indicating that it occurred in a dense stellar cluster in association with numerous massive stars.									68	1	0	2	0	69			0036-8075			WOS:000246724300039	17525336

Polyarylene networks via Bergman cyclopolymerization of bis-ortho-diynyl arenes								ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS				17	8			1237	1246		10.1002/adfm.200600450			MAY 21 2007	2007	Bis-ortho-diynylarene (BODA) monomers, prepared from common bisphenols in three high yielding steps, undergo free-radical-mediated thermal polymerization via an initial Bergman cyclo-rearrangement. Polymerization is carried out at 210 degrees C in solution or neat with large pre-vitrification melt windows (4-5 h) to form branched oligomers containing reactive pendant and terminal aryldiynes. Melt- and solution-processable oligomers with weight-average molecular weight M-w = 3000-24 000 g mol(-1) can be coated as a thin film or molded using soft lithography techniques. Subsequent curing to 450 degrees C affords network polymers with no detectable glass transition temperatures below 400 degrees C and thermal stability ranging from 0.5-1.5 % h(-1) isothermal weight loss measured at 450 degrees C under nitrogen. Heating to 900-1000 degrees C gives semiconductive glassy carbon in high yield. BODA monomer synthesis, network characterization and kinetics, processability, thin-film photoluminescence, and thermal properties are described.									22	2	0	4	0	23			1616-301X			WOS:000246861800002

J	Wang, James Z.; Du, Zhidian; Payattakool, Rapeeporn; Yu, Philip S.; Chen, Chin-Fu								A new method to measure the semantic similarity of GO terms								BIOINFORMATICS				23	10			1274	1281		10.1093/bioinformatics/btm087			MAY 15 2007	2007	Motivation: Although controlled biochemical or biological vocabularies, such as Gene Ontology (GO) (http://www.geneontology.org), address the need for consistent descriptions of genes in different data sources, there is still no effective method to determine the functional similarities of genes based on gene annotation information from heterogeneous data sources.Results: To address this critical need, we proposed a novel method to encode a GO term's semantics (biological meanings) into a numeric value by aggregating the semantic contributions of their ancestor terms (including this specific term) in the GO graph and, in turn, designed an algorithm to measure the semantic similarity of GO terms. Based on the semantic similarities of GO terms used for gene annotation, we designed a new algorithm to measure the functional similarity of genes. The results of using our algorithm to measure the functional similarities of genes in pathways retrieved from the saccharomyces genome database (SGD), and the outcomes of clustering these genes based on the similarity values obtained by our algorithm are shown to be consistent with human perspectives. Furthermore, we developed a set of online tools for gene similarity measurement and knowledge discovery.									327	19	0	267	0	346			1367-4803			WOS:000247348300013	17344234

This is the first nitrogen-containing monomer having nitrogen atoms as bridges between phenyl rings, and it was synthesized in three steps. The polymerization was carried out through the Ni(0)-catalyzed homocoupling reaction of the bis-(4-trifluoromethanesulfonyloxyphenyl)phenylamine compound. The resulting polymer, polybis(paraphenyl)phenylamine, emitted an intense blue color (where lambda = 415 nm) upon irradiation by ultraviolet light. The photoluminescence quantum yield was found to be 36% with a long excited-state lifetime of 3.3 ns. Electrical conductivity data for an HCl-doped film of the polymer were also examined. This novel polymer is of interest as an organic emitting material for electroluminescent devices. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0887-624X			WOS:000246122300005

Polymer microstructured fibers by one-step extrusion								OPTICS EXPRESS				15	10			6183	6189		10.1364/OE.15.006183			MAY 14 2007	2007	For the first time to our knowledge, polymer-based microstructured fibers with complex cross-sections are directly produced via melt extrusion. Two principal types of fibers were fabricated: a microstructured fiber of a single polymer with a hexagonal array of air holes and a bicomponent fiber consisting of approximately 60 coaxial rings. From the latter, strong visible iridescence was observed and is shown to exhibit a mechanochromic response. This approach, the mainstay of the textile trade for decades, offers a means of continuous high-volume low-cost manufacturing of polymer (and conceivably soft-glass) fibers. For example, in the present effort, 128 coaxially microstructured fibers were fabricated simultaneously at rates exceeding 1200 m/min from industrially mainstream polymers. This approach offers an important step forward towards commoditizing microstructured fibers and open new doors for optical engineering in fashion, marking/identification, and numerous military applications.

Although the roots of current research activity in this topic go back to the beginning of the twentieth century, advances in radar technology and in numerical modeling have provided the impetus for prolific research in the area of cloud and precipitation physics over the last 50 years. As radar rainfall measurements progressively became the staple of hydrometeorological observing systems, cloud and precipitation microphysics emerged as increasingly preeminent areas of research. Here we present a synthesis of the state of the science with respect to the physical dynamics of hydrometeors and, specifically, the transient processes that affect the temporal evolution of rainfall microstructure and that are directly relevant to the quantitative interpretation of radar rainfall measurements and explicit numerical simulations. The focus of our survey is on raindrop morphodynamics ( equilibrium raindrop shape and raindrop oscillations), drop-drop interactions ( bounce, coalescence, and breakup), and the dynamical evolution of raindrop size distributions in precipitating clouds.									25	0	0	1	0	25			8755-1209			WOS:000246500300001

Trapping experiments using N-phenylmaleimide as dipolarophile have shown that the reaction mechanism occurs by thermal removal of the nitrile oxide 1,3-dipole, in a process which is favored by the presence of Cu( II) as the catalyst. The ESI-MS study supports the observed retro-cycloaddition process for both C-60 and C-70 derivatives. In contrast to previous electrochemical retro-cycloaddition processes observed in fulleropyrrolidines, isoxazolinofullerenes were stable under oxidative conditions.									29	1	0	7	0	30			0022-3263			WOS:000246206700032	17385924

Embryonic motoneuron-skeletal muscle co-culture in a defined system								NEUROSCIENCE				146	2			481	488		10.1016/j.neuroscience.2007.01.068			MAY 11 2007	2007	This paper describes a significant biotechnological advancement by creating a minimalist serum-free defined system to co-culture rat mammalian nerve and muscle cells in order to form functional neuromuscular junctions. To date, all the known in vitro nerve and muscle co-culture models use serum containing media; and while functional neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) are described, they failed to detail or quantify the minimum factors needed to recreate the NMJ in vitro. In this work, we demonstrate the development of a defined motoneuron and muscle co-culture system resulting in the formation of NMJs including: 1) a new culture technique, 2) a novel serum-free medium formulation and 3) a synthetic self-assembled monolayer (SAM) substrate N-1 [3-(trimethoxysilyi) propyl] diethylenetriamine (DETA). We characterized the culture by morphology, immunocytochemistry, electrophysiology and videography. This model system provides a better understanding of the minimal growth factor and substrate interactions necessary for NMJ formation and provides a basic system that can be utilized for nerve-muscle tissue engineering, regenerative medicine and development of limb prosthetics.

Here we report on the dissipative particle dynamics simulations of the modulation of electroosmotic flow by neutral polymers. In these coarse-grained simulations, fluid and polymers are resolved at a scale comparable to polymer size and the two-way coupling between polymer conformation and fluid flow are explicitly accounted for. The simulations indicate that, in the parameter space explored, the screening of electroosmotic flow by polymers decreases nonlinearly as the external electric field increases. Such an observation is understood by analyzing the surface coverage by polymers, height and orientation of the grafted polymers, and the two different modes of flow screening by polymer segments as a function of the external electric field. Understanding the effects and interplay of these physical processes is crucial for the rational design of polymer coating for flow control in microfluidic and nanofluidic systems.									21	1	0	1	0	22			0743-7463			WOS:000246071800087	17432883

Although activated sintering starts more than 400 degrees C below the bulk eutectic temperature, the nickel-rich crystalline secondary phase does not wet the tungsten grain boundaries in the solid state. These results contrast with the classical activated sintering model whereby the secondary crystalline phase was presumed to wet grain boundaries completely. High resolution transmission electron microscopy and Auger electron spectroscopy revealed the presence of nanometer-thick, nickel-enriched, disordered films at grain boundaries well below the bulk eutectic temperature. These interfacial films can be regarded as metallic counterparts to widely observed equilibrium-thickness intergranular films in ceramics. Assuming they form at a true thermodynamic equilibrium, these films can alternatively be understood as a class of combined grain boundary disordering and adsorption structures resulting from coupled premelting and prewetting transitions. It is concluded that enhanced diffusion in these thin intergranular films is responsible for solid-state activated sintering. (c) 2007 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Differential display identifies genes in Chinese hamster ovary cells sensitive to elevated ammonium								APPLIED BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY				141	2-3			349	359		10.1007/BF02729072			MAY-JUN 2007	2007	Ammonium is a toxic waste product that has been reported to negatively inhibit cell growth and recombinant glycosylation in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells; however, the effect of this toxicity on intracellular gene expression has received only limited investigation. We used a differential display method to identify genes in CHO cells that were affected by ammonium stress. Eight genes whose rnRNA levels significantly changed in response to elevated ammonium were isolated and identified. Five of the genes were identified as having lower expression under the ammonium stress, whereas three genes were identified as having higher expression. Sequence homology with other mammalian organisms was used to attribute function to these newly identified genes. The identified ammonium-sensitive genes were grouped into three broad functional groups: cellular processes, energy metabolism, and genetic-information processing. The three cellular process-related genes had lower expression (anaphase-promoting complex subunit 5, eukaryotic initiation factor 5A II, KIAA1091 protein). The two energy-related genes had higher expression under ammonium stress (adenosine triphosphate synthase subunit C and mitofusin 1). Both of the genetic information-processing genes (endoplasmic reticulum [ER]-resident protein ERdj5 and structure-specific recognition protein 1) had lower expression under the ammonium stress, whereas the 26S proteasome subunit adenosine triphosphatase 3 gene had higher expression. These preliminary results indicate that ammonium stress lowers expression of genes controlling cell cycle, protein folding, and quality and raises genes that control energy metabolism and degradation. Our findings demonstrate the usefulness of mRNA differential-display techniques for the detection of CHO cell genes affected by ammonium stress.									6	1	0	6	0	7			0273-2289			WOS:000250048700014	18025561	
J	Kim, Young Jin; Cho, Byung Rae; Kim, Nam-Ki								Economic design of inspection procedures using guard band when measurement errors are present								APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING				31	5			805	816		10.1016/j.apm.2005.12.008			MAY 2007	2007	One of the most important aspects in designing production systems is implementing an adequate inspection procedure to ensure the product quality. Our literature study indicates that two important questions still remain unanswered. First, most of the previous studies on inspection procedures are mainly concerned with how to evaluate and analyze the adequacy of inspection procedures during a production stage. Although the issue of the adequacy of inspection procedures at this point is clearly important, many production processes may better benefit from designing enhanced inspection procedures during an early design stage. Second, the majority of previous studies do not incorporate possible economic impacts of measurement errors when inspection procedures need to be designed. More extensive efforts in designing inspection procedures need to be investigated based on economic considerations. Two approaches, the use of guard band and the selection of inspection precision level, are simultaneously examined for designing economic inspection procedures. By incorporating these two approaches, this paper proposes an optimization scheme for economic design of inspection procedures. A numerical example along with sensitivity analysis demonstrates the applicability of the proposed model. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

J	Ingram-Smith, Cheryl; Smith, Kerry S.								AMP-forming acetyl-CoA synthetases in Archaea show unexpected diversity in substrate utilization								Archaea				2	2			95	107					MAY 2007	2007	Adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-forming acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS; acetate:CoA ligase (AMP-forming), EC 6.2.1.1) is a key enzyme for conversion of acetate to acetyl-CoA, an essential intermediate at the junction of anabolic and catabolic pathways. Phylogenetic analysis of putative short and medium chain acyl-CoA synthetase sequences indicates that the ACSs form a distinct clade from other acyl-CoA synthetases. Within this clade, the archaeal ACSs are not monophyletic and fail into three groups composed of both bacterial and archaeal sequences. Kinetic analysis of two archaeal enzymes, an ACS from Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus (designated as MT-ACS1) and an ACS from Archaeoglobus fulgidus (designated as AF-ACS2), revealed that these enzymes have very different properties. MT-ACS1 has nearly 11 -fold higher affinity and 14-fold higher catalytic efficiency with acetate than with propionate, a property shared by most ACSs. However, AF-ACS2 has only 2.3-fold higher affinity and catalytic efficiency with acetate than with propionate. This enzyme has an affinity for propionate that is almost identical to that of MT-ACS I for acetate and nearly tenfold higher than the affinity of MT-ACS I for propionate. Furthermore, MT-ACS1 is limited to acetate and propionate as acyl substrates, whereas AF-ACS2 can also utilize longer straight and branched chain acyl substrates. Phylogenetic analysis, sequence alignment and structural modeling suggest a molecular basis for the altered substrate preference and expanded substrate range of AF-ACS2 versus MT-ACS1.									14	2	0	16	0	16			1472-3646	1472-3654		BCI:BCI200700428610	17350930

Language performance under sustained work and sleep deprivation conditions								AVIATION SPACE AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE				78	5			B25	B38				S	MAY 2007	2007	Introduction: Although substantial research has been completed on the effects of sleep deprivation on performance, very little research has focused on language-based tasks. The purpose of the current study was two-fold: 1) to determine the extent to which short-term sleep deprivation affects language performance; and 2) to examine whether relatively short and easy-to-administer "probe" tasks could signal decrements in language performance under sleep deprivation conditions. Methods: There were 38 non-native English-speaking students who were paid to complete a 28-h sleep deprivation study. The participants completed several potential cognitive and vigilance probe tasks and a variety of language-based tasks. Each task was administered four times, once in each testing session during the night (18:30-22:30, 23:00-03:00, 03: 30-07:30, and 08:00-12:00). All tasks were counterbalanced across the testing sessions. Results: Repeated-measures ANOVAs indicated that language tasks that required sustained attention and higher level processing (e.g., reading comprehension) were negatively affected by sleep deprivation, whereas other tasks that relied primarily on more basic language processing (e.g., antonym identification) were not affected. Hierarchical linear modeling analyses assessed how well the probe tasks predicted language performance. These results indicated that performance accuracy and/or speed on many of the probe tasks predicted decrements in language performance. Conclusions: These findings suggest that sustained work conditions and sleep deprivation negatively affect some types of language performance. Moreover, the use of probe tasks indicates that easy-to-administer tasks may be useful to identify when detriments are likely to occur in language-based performance under sleep deprivation conditions.									18	1	0	11	0	20			0095-6562			WOS:000246460800006	17547302

Human performance under sustained operations and acute sleep deprivation conditions: Toward a model of controlled attention								AVIATION SPACE AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE				78	5			B15	B24				S	MAY 2007	2007	Introduction: Although a number of studies have examined the effects of sleep deprivation on performance, the results are not easily explained. The purpose of the current study was to examine the effects of sustained operations and acute sleep deprivation on tasks that require a wide range of information processing. The current study also provided preliminary data on the use of the controlled attention model to better understand the effects of sleep deprivation. Methods: There were 24 college students who were paid to remain awake for one night and complete a variety of cognitive and vigilance tasks. Each task was administered four times during the night, once in each testing session (17:30-21:30, 21:45-01:45, 02:30-06:30, and 06:45-10:45). All tasks were counterbalanced across the testing sessions. Results:The data were converted to z-scores and repeated-measures ANOVAs were completed. Performance did not significantly decrease on the more complex cognitive tasks over the night of sleep deprivation. Performance on the vigilance tasks decreased significantly across the night. Conclusions: Examining the characteristics of the cognitive tasks indicated that although they required different types of processing, they encouraged the participants to remain attentive to and engaged in the task. In contrast, the vigilance tasks were less intrinsically interesting and engaging. Thus, it seems likely that the participants were less capable of maintaining attention on the vigilance tasks than the cognitive tasks. These results indicate that a controlled attention model may be useful in better understanding the effects of sustained operations and sleep deprivation on performance.									35	3	0	22	0	38			0095-6562			WOS:000246460800005	17547301

Out of 47 strains tested, 37% were found to release free ferulic acid from the growth substrate. One strain, identified as Streptomyces tendae by 16 S RNA gene sequencing, was capable of releasing 80% of the ferulic acid ester-linked to the pectin in SBP after 5 days of growth. These data suggest that some actinomycetes are able to release ferulic acid and feruloylated oligosaccharides from SBP. During growth on SBP, it seems that Streptomyces species solubilize and release feruloylated oligosaccharides by specific carbohydrase activities before de-esterification and release of free ferulic acid.

J	Shen, Junan; Arnirkhanian, Serji; Tang, Boming								Effects of rejuvenator on performance-based properties of rejuvenated asphalt binder and mixtures								CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS				21	5			958	964		10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2006.03.006			MAY 2007	2007	Firstly, the performance-based properties of rejuvenated aged asphalt binders, i.e., the blends of aged binders containing a rejuvenator at various percentages, were investigated under high, intermediate and low temperatures. The tests were conducted on the blends at three stages as follows: no aging, rolling thin film oven (RTFO) residuals and as well RTFO + pressure aging vessel (PAV) residuals through dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) and bending beam rheometer (BBR) tests. Optimum concentrations of the rejuvenator needed for the blends to reach a target PG grade were obtained from the blending charts of the rejuvenated aged binders in terms of performance properties. The rejuvenator is a soft binder containing a low asphaltene content of 2 wt%. Secondly, selected performance-based properties were conducted on hot mix asphalt (HMA) using the rejuvenated aged binder and a virgin HMA as a control mixture. Results showed that the rejuvenator affected significantly the performance-based properties of both the rejuvenated aged binders and the mixtures containing the rejuvenated aged binders. It was possible to get optimum concentrations of the rejuvenator using the blending charts so that the rejuvenated binders reach a target PG grade. The mean value of the concentrations was proved to be more reliable through the performance-based properties of the mixtures if it is used for a design value for recycling. The properties of the asphalt paving mixtures with the rejuvenated binders were even improved or in the same level as the properties of the virgin mixtures. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Holb, Imre J.; Schnabel, Guido								Differential effect of triazoles on mycelial growth and disease measurements of Monilinia fructicola isolates with reduced sensitivity to DMI fungicides								CROP PROTECTION				26	5			753	759		10.1016/j.cropro.2006.07.001			MAY 2007	2007	Demethylation-inhibitor fungicides (DMIs) are key components for managing Monilinia fructicola populations, even those with demonstrated reduced DMI sensitivity because few effective alternatives are available. Rotational fungicide programs that include DMIs would therefore benefit from selection of the most effective DMI. The goal of this study was to investigate the in vitro efficacy and in vivo potential of three triazole fungicides to reduce brown rot disease caused by M. fructicola isolates sensitive or with reduced sensitivity to DMIs. Baseline isolate SCDL71.01 was sensitive to propiconazole, tebuconazole, and fenbuconazole with mean EC50 values ranging from 0.018 to 0.023 mu l ml(-1). Single spore isolates collected from an orchard in middle Georgia (GADL) were significantly less sensitive to all three triazoles compared to SCDL71.01; however, tebuconazole and fenbuconazole were significantly more effective compared to propiconazole in vitro. Protective and curative applications of each triazole on SCDL71.01 inoculated fruit prevented disease development. However, there were significant differences in efficacy of these triazoles when fruit were inoculated with GADL isolates. In protective applications, fenbuconazole and tebuconazole were significantly (P < 0.05) more effective compared to propiconazole in reducing important disease measurements of GADL isolates. In curative applications, tebuconazole alone was most effective (P < 0.05) in reducing disease measurements of GADL isolates. Both, in vitro and in vivo results indicate differential performances among triazoles against isolates with reduced sensitivity to DMIs. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Nielson, Bryant G.; DesRoches, Reginald				DesRoches, Reginald /F-5875-2011				Seismic fragility methodology for highway bridges using a component level approach								EARTHQUAKE ENGINEERING & STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS				36	6			823	839		10.1002/eqe.655			MAY 2007	2007	Bridge fragility curves, which express the probability of a bridge reaching a certain damage state for a given ground motion parameter, play an important role in the overall seismic risk assessment of a transportation network. Current analytical methodologies for generating bridge fragility curves do not adequately account for all major contributing bridge components. Studies have shown that for some bridge types, neglecting to account for all of these components can lead to a misrepresentation of the bridges' overall fragilities.In this study, an expanded methodology for the generation of analytical fragility curves for highway bridges is)resented. This methodology considers the contribution of the major components of the bridge, such as the columns, bearings and abutments, to its overall bridge system fragility. In particular, this methodology utilizes probability tools to directly estimate the bridge system fragility from the individual component fragilities. This is illustrated using a bridge whose construction and configuration are typical to the Centra and Southeastern United States and the results are presented and discussed herein. This study shows that the bridge as a system is more fragile than any one of the individual components. Assuming that the columns represent the entire bridge system can result in errors as large as 50% at higher damage states. This provide; support to the assertion that multiple bridge components should be considered in the development of bridge fragility curves. The findings also show that estimation of the bridge fragilities by their first-order bounds could result in errors of up to 40%.

Chemical conversion proceeded either by elimination of (5-FU) or by hydrolysis of ester group. 5-FU was released from NFGIp, NFGE and NFGM 90.5%, 71.3% and 48.5% of the dose, respectively, in 80% human plasma and 79.8%, 56.3% and 31.6%, respectively, in pH 7.4 buffer solution after 48 h of incubation at 37 degrees C. Release of 5-FU occurred mainly from NFG esters but very slightly from NFG, which suggested that release of 5-FU was greatly dependent on the stability of the ester group against hydrolysis. Solubility (M) in pH 7.4 buffer solution was 0.13, 0.09 and 0.04 and apparent partition coefficient in 1-octanol/pH 7.4 buffer solution was 0.76, 1.61 and 4.2, respectively, for NFGM, NFGE and NFGIp, which were in the ranges suitable for rectal absorption. Plasma concentration (mu g/mL) of NFGM, NFGE and NFGIp at 50 min after rectal administration to rats was 1.9, 4.6 and 6.7, respectively, and that for 5-FU was below the limit of detection. Their potential as prodrugs of 5-FU for rectal administration is suggested. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									10	5	0	4	0	12			0939-6411			WOS:000246921100012	17182232

Rowley								FOCUS ON EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN				39	9			1	12					MAY 2007	2007	June 22, 2007, was the 25th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Board of Education of the Hendrick Hudson Central School District v. Rowley(I) (hereafter Rowley; 1982). In Rowley, the Supreme Court interpreted congressional intent in requiring that public schools provide a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to students with disabilities under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). This ruling- which is arguably the most important special education decision by the high court-has had a profound effect on the education of students with disabilities.In this article we reflect on the importance of this decision and discuss how changes in IDEA in the 1997 and 2004 reauthorizations have changed the definition of a FAPE. First, we briefly review passage of the Education for All Handicapped Children ACt(2) (EAHCA) in 1975. Second, we examine, the facts of the Rowley case and the Supreme Court's ruling. Third, we look at some court cases following Rowley, which interpreted the meaning of the Supreme Court's ruling. Fourth, we consider the effects of IDEA 1997 and 2004 on the meaning of FAPE. Finally, we discuss principles that school districts should follow when developing individualized education programs (IEPs) that provide a FAPE for students with disabilities.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0015-511X			WOS:000253305000001

Two removable borehole extensometers were designed to measure small displacements in order to improve the characterization of fractured rock aquifers using hydraulic well tests. The extensometers consist of four major components: (1) a pair of anchors, (2) a temperature-compensated reference rod, (3) a registration system, and (4) a displacement transducer. One extensometer uses an axial reference rod with multiple, low-profile anchors, whereas another uses an offset reference rod with a single pair of anchors. Both designs can be readily mobilized and are capable of resolving submicron displacements in boreholes.									11	0	0	1	0	11			0149-6115			WOS:000246310000004		
J	DeVol, Timothy A.; Theisen, Christopher D.; DiPrete, David P.								Effect of quench on alpha/beta pulse shape discrimination of liquid scintillation cocktails								HEALTH PHYSICS				92	5			S105	S111		10.1097/01.HP.0000256287.37767.5c		S	MAY 2007	2007	The objectives of this paper are (1) to illustrate that knowledge of the external quench parameter is insufficient to properly setup a pulse shape discriminating liquid scintillation counter (LSC) for quantitative measurement, (2) to illustrate dependence on pulse shape discrimination on the radionuclide (more than just radiation and energy), and (3) to compare the pulse shape discrimination (PSD) of two commercial instruments. The effects various quenching agents, liquid scintillation cocktails, radionuclides, and LSCs have on alpha/beta pulse shape discriminating liquid scintillation counting were quantified. Alpha emitting radionuclides Pu-239 and Am-241 and beta emitter Sr-90/Y-90 were investigated to quantify the nuclide dependence on alpha/beta pulse shape discrimination. Also, chemical and color quenching agents, nitromethane, nitric acid, and yellow dye impact on alpha/beta pulse shape discrimination using PerkinElmer Optiphase "HiSafe" 2 and 3, and Ultima Gold AB liquid scintillation cocktails were determined. The prepared samples were counted on the PerkinElmer Wallac WinSpectral 1414 alpha/beta pulse shape discriminating LSC. It was found that for the same level or quench, as measured by the external quench parameter, different quench agents influenced the pulse shape discrimination and the pulse shape discrimination parameter; differently. The radionuclide also affects alpha/beta pulse shape discrimination. By comparison with the PerkinElmer Tri-carb 3150 TR/AB, the Wallac 1414 exhibited better pulse shape discrimination capability tinder the same experimental conditions.									10	0	0	2	0	10			0017-9078	1538-5159		WOS:000245959400006	17440321

This paper concerns analyzing HRV outside of controlled environments, such as on an actively moving person. We describe automated methods for inter-heartbeat interval (IBI) error detection and correction. We collected 124,998 IBIs from 18 subjects, undergoing a variety of active motions, for use in evaluating our methods. Two human graders manually labeled each IBI, evaluating 10% of the IBIs as having an error, which is a far greater error percentage than has been examined in any previous study. Our automated method had a 96% agreement rate with the two human graders when they themselves agreed, with a 49% rate of matching specific error corrections and a 0.01% false alarm rate.									8	0	0	3	0	8			0018-9294			WOS:000245872700022	17518294

The parallel HEV control problem involves the determination of the time profiles of the power flows from the engine and the electric motor. This is also referred to as the power split between the conventional and the electric sources. The objective of HEV control is in fact to find out the sequence of optimal power splits at each instant of time that minimizes the fuel consumption over a given driving schedule. Big obstacles to the control design are the model complexity and the necessity of "a priori" knowledge of torque and velocity profiles. This paper presents three different energy management approaches for the control of a parallel hybrid electric sport-utility-vehicle that do not require a priori knowledge of the driving cycle. The considered approaches are: a rule-based control, an, adaptive equivalent fuel consumption minimization strategy (A-ECMS), and the H-infinity control. Results, compared with the optimal solution given by the dynamic programming, show that the A-ECMS strategy is the best performing strategy.									188	10	0	1	0	198			1063-6536			WOS:000246192300012

Efficient methods for determining the coupling to wires in circular cavities								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTROMAGNETIC COMPATIBILITY				49	2			382	390		10.1109/TEMC.2006.890169			MAY 2007	2007	The electromagnetic field coupling to a loaded thin wire in a cylindrical/coaxial cavity is investigated. Computationally efficient methods are presented for determining the coupling to a thin wire located near a cavity wall in a system of cascaded and/or overlapping coaxial and circular cylindrical cavity sections, and the accuracy and limitations of these methods are established. The sections are coupled through apertures and conducting elements common to more than one section, which may have different axial and radial dimensions and which may be filled with material having different magnetic and electric properties. The loaded thin wire is close to the outer wall of a cavity section and may represent a cable or, perhaps, a conducting tube. The coupling of the cavity field to the wire is determined from an analysis of a distributed voltage and current source model based on transmission line theory as well as via coupled integral equations techniques. The accuracy of the results obtained from these analyses is supported by experimental data measured on a laboratory model of the cavity-wire structure.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0018-9375			WOS:000247488300021

To do this, we use both the voltage and current BLT equations in the time domain, together with the nonlinear v-i relationships for the termination loads, to formulate a nonlinear BLT equation for the unknown reflection coefficients at each end of the line. This equation is solved by a time-marching procedure, and its solution provides transient reflection coefficients at the nonlinear terminations. Once the reflection coefficients are determined, the load voltages and currents can be computed from the transient BLT equations. This computational procedure is illustrated with several examples.									19	17	0	0	0	33			0018-9375			WOS:000247488300026

Exploring ambidextrous innovation tendencies in the adoption of telecommunications technologies								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT				54	2			268	285		10.1109/TEM.2007.893995			MAY 2007	2007	As the importance of information technology has increased within the business domain, so too has the significance of innovating within those information technologies. The recent proliferation of telecommunications technologies, coupled with conventional information technology, has resulted in a new class of applications with important competitive implications. An important issue for organizations, then, is the causal sequence that leads to more innovative telecommunications adoption. Previous innovation research has shown radical and incremental innovation employing vastly different strategy-structure sequence configurations. Two proposals have been offered on how an organization can effectively innovate incrementally and radically: first, through the use of semi-structures, and second,by utilizing both configurations simultaneously, termed ambidextrous. This paper seeks 1) to determine whether organizations are balancing innovation efforts, and 2) if so, are organizations managing the effort using semi-structures or an ambidextrous approach. The research is conducted within the telecommunications industry by employing theoretical typologies of radical and incremental innovation developed in the literature. Based on a sample of 154 organizations the findings suggest that organizations are indeed using a balanced approach to overall innovativeness by using paradoxical, dual models of innovation simultaneously. Implications for researchers and practitioners are discussed.									12	0	0	0	1	13			0018-9391	1558-0040		WOS:000246090600004

Sensor radios available so far have been engineered for consumer-grade applications, featuring low cost, low power, and minimal radio complexity. In order to utilize such radios for factory applications, their channel characteristics and link quality must be investigated for optimal design and reliability assessment. In this paper, a series of measurements were made with IEEE 802.15.4-compliant sensor radios to study both their spatial and temporal characteristics with respect to the factory surroundings found in a university machine shop. Critical communication properties were investigated in terms of received signal strength, link quality indication, and packet error rate. It is found that received signal strength shows dependency on surrounding structures, radio link qualities with respect to received signal strength and link quality indication are stable before a grey zone is reached, and average link quality indicator serves as a better packet success rate indication than average received signal strength indication. The findings in this paper provide a useful guidance to the ongoing explorations for a methodology to predict radio performance at any location within a given factory floor plan and to online assess the time-variant link qualities.									91	4	0	0	0	95			1551-3203			WOS:000246821800003

The underlying assumptions necessary for the development of the controller are highlighted, and the control law is derived in detail. Performance comparisons are conducted against a linear state feedback with integral controller and a standard PID controller, the latter being the most common industrial solution. Results show that the nonlinear partial feedback linearising controller has improved tracking properties, as might be expected from its use of more modelling and feedback information. Multiple experiments are also conducted to investigate the robustness of the system to certain model parameters; it is shown that the controller tolerates a measurable shift in these parameters.									13	0	0	0	0	13			1751-8644	1751-8652		WOS:000247229500018		
J	Mahmoodi, S. Nima; Jalili, Nader								Non-linear vibrations and frequency response analysis of piezoelectrically driven microcantilevers								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NON-LINEAR MECHANICS				42	4			577	587		10.1016/j.ijnonlinmec.2007.01.019			MAY 2007	2007	Microcantilevers have recently received widespread attentions due to their extreme applicability and versatility in both biological and non-biological applications. Along this line, this paper undertakes the non-linear vibrations of a piezoelectrically driven microcantilever beam as a common configuration in many scanning probe microscopy and nanomechanical cantilever biosensor systems. A part of the microcantilever beam surface is covered by a piezoelectric layer (typically ZrO) which acts both as an actuator and sensor. The bending vibrations of the microcantilever beam are studied considering the inextensibility condition and the coupling between electrical and mechanical properties in the piezoelectric materials. The non-linear terms appear in the form of quadratic expression due to presence of piezoelectric layer, and cubic form due to geometrical non-linearities. The Galerkin approximation is then utilized to discretize the equations of motion. In addition, the method of multiple scales is applied to arrive at the closed form solution for the fundamental natural frequency of the system. An experimental setup consisting of a commercial piezoelectric microcantilever attached on the stand of a state-of-the-art microsystem analyzer for non-contact vibration measurement is utilized to verify the theoretical developments. It is found that the experimental results and theoretical findings are in good agreement, which demonstrates that the non-linear modeling framework could provide a better dynamic representation of the microcantilever than the previous linear models. Due to microscale nature of the system, excitation amplitude plays an important role since even a small change in the amplitude of excitation can lead to significant vibrations and frequency shift.

J	Afshari, Mana; Jalili, Nader								Towards non-linear modeling of molecular interactions arising from adsorbed biological species on the microcantilever surface								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NON-LINEAR MECHANICS				42	4			588	595		10.1016/j.ijnonlinmec.2007.01.014			MAY 2007	2007	Microcantilever-based biosensors are rapidly becoming an enabling sensing technology for a variety of label-free biological applications due to their extreme applicability, versatility and low cost. These sensors operate through the adsorption of species on the functionalized surface of microcantilevers. This paper presents a general framework towards modeling resonance frequency changes induced due to the surface stress arising from the adsorption of biological species on the surface of the microcantilever. Very few works have dealt with the effect of surface stress on the resonance frequency shifts of microcantilevers and have mainly assumed a simple model for the vibrating microcantilever beam. In the proposed modeling framework, the non-linear terms due to the beam's flexural rigidity from macro- to microscale as well as varying nature of the adsorption induced surface stress are considered. It is first shown that the non-linearity of the system originates from two different sources, namely, microcantilever flexural rigidity and adsorption induced surface stress. Through simulation results, it is demonstrated that the non-linearity due to the surface stress does not have a considerable effect on the resonance frequency change of the microcantilever. However, non-linearity due to flexural rigidity (which is directly attributed to beam's dimensions) plays an important role in the resonance frequency shift, and hence, in the resultant molecular recognition capability. It is then shown that the adsorption induced resonance frequency shift highly depends on the size of the microcantilever. It is also demonstrated that the effect of surface stress and molecular arrangement modeling presented in this paper is more sensitive to the change of the microcantilever length.

Willem								Comparison of crystallization and melting characteristics of quiescent and melt-spun poly(ethylene-co-octene) copolymers								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLYMER ANALYSIS AND CHARACTERIZATION				12	3			231	249		10.1080/10236660701223816			MAY-JUN 2007	2007	An experimental study of crystallization and melting of polyethylene and its octene copolymers under quiescent conditions and their melt-spun fibers is presented. This includes copolymers produced by both Dow's Insite" Technology homogeneous catalyst and by a Ziegler heterogeneous catalyst. It is found that with increasing comonomer content, both isothermal and non-isothermal crystallization rate decrease. The melting peaks become broader and the melting temperatures decrease for polymers with more comonomer. Multiple melting peaks are observed for copolymers. Except the unchanged peak with the highest melting temperature, the other peaks move to higher temperature after being annealed under higher temperature. Attempts were made to correlate crystallization kinetics and melting behavior under quiescent conditions with melting temperatures and crystallinities determined for their melt-spun fibers. The results show that besides cooling effects, the melt temperatures and the crystallinities of the melt spun fibers are also affected by the degree of molecular orientation, which is mainly decided by file spin-line stress.

Effects on in vivo digestibility, performance, and carcass traits								JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE				85	5			1330	1339		10.2527/jas.2006-623			MAY 2007	2007	Eighteen Angus steers (438 +/- 4 kg of BW) were supplemented with varying levels of corn oil (0 g/kg of BW, none; 0.75 g/kg of BW, MED; or 1.5 g/kg of BW, HI) on rotationally stocked, endophyte-free tall fescue to determine the effect of supplemental oil level on in vivo digestibility, intake, performance, and carcass traits. Pelleted cottonseed hulls were used as a carrier for the oil supplements, and all supplements were offered to steers using Calan gate feeders for individual intake determination. On d 49, each steer was dosed with a controlled-release capsule containing chromium sesquioxide, and fecal samples were obtained 12 d later over a 7-d period to estimate fecal output that, with forage, supplement, and fecal indigestible NDF concentration, was used to estimate DMI and in vivo total diet digestibility. Steers were slaughtered at the end of the 116-d grazing period, and carcass data were collected at 24 h postmortem. Total fatty acid intake linearly increased with corn oil supplementation, and forage DMI, total DMI, and total DE intake were linearly decreased (P < 0.01). The decrease in total DMI was reflected in forage substitution rates greater (P = 0.01) than 1, with a trend (P = 0.09) for a greater substitution rate in HI than in MED. In vivo DM, OM, and NDF digestibility were linearly decreased (P < 0.01) by corn oil supplementation. Average daily gain and final BW tended (P = 0.09) to increase linearly in response to oil level. Oil conversion (0.36 kg of BW gain/kg of corn oil) was greater (P = 0.05) than zero and did not differ (P = 0.15) between MED and HI. Dressing percent (P = 0.09), carcass weight (P = 0.01), and carcass backfat thickness (P = 0.01) increased linearly with oil supplementation. No treatment effect was observed for carcass LM area, KPH percentage, marbling score, or yield grade (P > 0.10). Oil supplementation to grazing steers linearly reduced forage DMI intake; however, animal performance was maintained and tended to be greater for oil-supplemented cattle. Oil supplementation increased carcass fat thickness and weight without altering other carcass quality parameters.									19	0	0	16	2	20			0021-8812			WOS:000245852300027	17224464

The moderating role of subordinate political skill on supervisors' impressions of subordinate ingratiation and ratings of subordinate interpersonal facilitation								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY				92	3			848	855		10.1037/0021-9010.92.3.848			MAY 2007	2007	Nearly 2 decades ago, social influence theorists called for a new stream of research that would investigate why and how influence tactics are effective. The present study proposed that political skill affects the style of execution of influence attempts. It utilized balance theory to explain the moderating effect of employee political skill on the relationships between self- and supervisor-reported ingratiation. Additionally, supervisor reports of subordinate ingratiation were hypothesized to be negatively related to supervisor ratings of subordinate interpersonal facilitation. Results from a combined sample of 2 retail service organizations provided evidence that subordinates with high political skill were less likely than those low in political skill to have their demonstrated ingratiation behavior perceived by targets as a manipulative influence attempt. Also, when subordinates were perceived by their supervisors to engage in more ingratiation behavior, the subordinates were rated lower on interpersonal facilitation. Implications of these findings, limitations, and future research directions are provided.									97	3	0	0	0	100			0021-9010			WOS:000246257600021	17484564

A subset S subset of V(G) is an m-tuple dominating set if S dominates every vertex of G at least m times, and an m-dominating set if S dominates every vertex of G - S at least m times. The minimum cardinality of a dominating set is gamma, of an m-dominating set is gamma(m), and of an m-tuple dominating set is. x m. For a property p of subsets of V( G), with associated parameter f(pi), the k-restricted pi-number r(k) (G, f(pi)) is the smallest integer r such that given any subset K of ( at most) k vertices of G, there exists a pi set containing K of (at most) cardinality r. We show that for 1 <= k <= n where n is the order of G: ( a) if G has minimum degree m, then r(k) (G,gamma(m)) <= (mn + k)/(m + 1); ( b) if G has minimum degree 3, then r(k) (G, gamma) <= (3n + 5k)/ 8; and ( c) if G is connected with minimum degree at least 2, then r(k) (G, gamma x 2) <= 3n/4 + 2k/7.

SuCPV produces small (typically 0.25 mu m), polyhedral shaped inclusion bodies (polyhedra), in which the virus particles become multiply embedded. SuCPV is the third cypovirus isolated from Diptera, but the first from Simuliidae that has been characterized using molecular analyses. SuCPV has a genome composed of 10 segments of dsRNA, with an electrophoretic migration pattern that is different from those of recent UsCPV-17 and CrCPV-17 isolates from the mosquitoes Uranotaenia sapphirina and Culex restuans, respectively. The SuCPV electropherotype appears to show significant differences from those of the previously characterized lepidopteran cypoviruses. Sequence analysis of SuCPV segment 10 shows that it is unrelated to either of the two CPV isolates from Diptera or to the CPV species for which Seg-10 has been previously characterized from Lepidoptera. A comparison of the terminal regions of SuCPV genome segments to those of CPV-1, 2, 4, 5 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19 also revealed only low levels of conservation. We therefore, propose that SuCPV is classified within a new Cypovirus species, which we have tentatively identified as Cypovirus-20. We have therefore referred to this virus isolate as S. ubiquitum CPV-20 (SuCPV-20). (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.									8	2	0	9	0	10			0022-2011			WOS:000245964500004	17224161

In this study, Superpave mixtures containing RAP were designed using rejuvenating agents, including a rejuvenator and a softer binder, and subsequently evaluated in terms of the volumetric results, obtained the indirect tensile strength (ITS) of samples as well as evaluating the mixtures for rutting using the asphalt pavement analyzer (APA). The content of the rejuvenator used for those mixtures containing the rejuvenator was determined from the blending charts of RAP binders containing the rejuvenator. A total of 12 Superpave mixtures including 10 containing RAP and two virgin were designed. The results indicated, for the mixtures tested for this project, that: (1) properties of the recycled mixtures using the rejuvenator, such as ITS and APA, were better than those containing the softer binder; (2) 10% more RAP could be incorporated in the Superpave mixtures by using the rejuvenator than using the softer binder; and (3) the blending charts established under the Superpave binder specifications can be used to determine the content of the rejuvenator for the recycling.									52	3	0	2	1	55			0899-1561			WOS:000245772000002

Raman gain and surface damage threshold at 1064 nm are also shown for a selection of these glasses, which all exhibited high gain and damage resistance. Raman gain spectra were directly measured and accurately calculated for selected TZN and fluorotellurite glasses after Fresnel, internal solid angle, and Bose-Einstein corrections. The calculated gain showed good fits to the Raman gain measurements made using a calibrated nonlinear optics apparatus. Infrared and UV-Vis absorption spectra, characteristic temperatures obtained by differential thermal analysis, densities acquired by the Archimedes principle and refractive indices measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry are also given. The ternary systems TeO2-WO3-Bi2O3 and TeO2-Na2O-ZnF2 and the quaternary system TeO2-Na2O-ZnO-PbO show promise as Raman amplifiers as they are relatively easy to draw into optical fiber and to these authors' knowledge, this is the first time Raman gain has been presented on halide containing tellurite glasses. The oxyfluoride system studied here, TeO2-Na2O-ZnF2, exhibited a dependence on the peak Raman intensity with ZnF2 addition. Calculations of preform geometry for mono- and multimode guidance and stresses in similar and dissimilar (core suction) core-clad pairs are shown. Dispersion in the mid-infrared and initial fiber drawing studies are also reported with fibers showing reasonable unclad losses.

J	Liu, Zongrang; Scorza, Ralph; Hily, Jean-Michel; Scott, Simon W.; James, Delano								Engineering resistance to multiple Prunus fruit viruses through expression of chimeric hairpins								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE				132	3			407	414					MAY 2007	2007	Prunus L. fruit production is seriously affected by several predominant viruses. The development of new cultivars resistant to these viruses is challenging but highly desired by breeders and growers. We report a posttranscriptional gene silencing-based approach for engineering multivirus resistance in plants. A single chimeric transgene, PTRAP6, was created by the fusion of 400 to 500-base pair (bp) gene fragments from six major Primus fruit viruses, including american plum line pattern virus, peach mosaic virus, plum pox virus (PPV), prune dwarf virus (PDV), prunus necrotic ringspot virus, and tomato ringspot virus (ToRSV). Both strands of PTRAP6 were found being transcribed as an approximate to 2.5-kilobp transcript in planta without splicing interruption. To induce gene silencing/virus resistance, we placed two copies of PTRAP6 in an inverted. repeat under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter and separated by an intron spacer fragment to create PTRAP6i. Inoculation of the resulting transgenic Nicotiana benthandana Domin. plants revealed that 12 of 28 R-0 PTRAP6i transgenic lines (43%) were resistant to ToRSV ranging from mild symptoms to symptom-free phenotypes. Detailed analysis of two of three highly resistant homozygous R-3 generation lines demonstrated that they were resistant to all three viruses tested, including PDV, PPV, and ToRSV. The remaining three viruses targeted by PTPAP6i were either unavailable for this study or were unable to systemically infect N. benthandana. Transgene-wide and -specific small interfering RNA species were detected along with disappearance of transgene transcript in the resistant lines, indicating that posttranscriptional gene silencing underlies the mechanism of resistance. This work presents evidence that PTRAP6i is able to confer gene silencing-based resistance to multiple Primus fruit viruses.									8	0	0	8	0	8			0003-1062			WOS:000246602200017

Size variation of trichospores of Harpella melusinae in larval black flies								MYCOLOGIA				99	3			351	355		10.3852/mycologia.99.3.351			MAY-JUN 2007	2007	Trichospores of Harpella melusinae in larval black flies from four streams in northwestern South Carolina were measured. The longest fresh trichospore was 242 pm, 38% longer than the reported rnaximum length of trichospores for this species. After staining with lactophenol cotton blue, trichospore length was significantly reduced by up to 24.4% in fresh larvae and up to 4.9% in fixed larvae. Mean trichospore length differed significantly between seasons and between sampling sites but did not differ significantly between middle and final instars. Trichospore length correlated significantly with host size. We suggest that taxonomic descriptions of trichomycetes should include measurements of fresh, fixed and stained trichospores.									6	0	0	5	0	6			0027-5514			WOS:000249050900002	17883026

This entails a careful analysis of the time scales involved in the deuterization of carbon by particle bombardment. The substrate structure is heavily modified by cumulative impacts, and the sputtering yields change with bombardment time, eventually reaching a quasi-steady-state. Such state is reached at approximately the same fluence of D and D, impact. The yields of the hydrocarbons in this quasi-steady-state regime are in good agreement with experiment, and are significantly larger and of different structure than those from the unmodified surfaces.

Comparative genomics in the Brassicaceae has largely focused on direct comparisons between Arabidopsis and the species of interest. However, the reduced genome size and chromosome number (n = 5) of Arabidopsis complicates comparisons. Arabidopsis shows extensive genome and chromosome reshuffling compared to its close relatives Arabidopsis lyrata and Capsella rubella, both with n = 8. To facilitate comparative genomics across the Brassicaceae we recently outlined a system of 24 conserved chromosomal blocks based on their positions in an ancestral karyotype of n 5 8, rather than by their position in Arabidopsis. In this report we use this system as a tool to understand genome structure and evolution in Boechera stricta (n = 7). B. stricta is a diploid, sexual, and highly self-fertilizing species occurring in mostly montane regions of western North America. We have created an F(2) genetic map of B. stricta based on 192 individuals scored at 196 microsatellite and candidate gene loci. Single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping of 94 of the loci was done simultaneously using an Illumina bead array. The total map length is 725.8 cM, with an average marker spacing of 3.9 cM. There are no gaps greater than 19.3 cM. The chromosomal reduction from n 5 8 to n 5 7 and other genomic changes in B. stricta likely involved a pericentric inversion, a chromosomal fusion, and two reciprocal translocations that are easily visualized using the genomic blocks. Our genetic map will facilitate the analysis of ecologically relevant quantitative variation in Boechera.									49	2	0	47	0	51			0032-0889			WOS:000246356300024	17369426

A total of 50 college-level students searched for the source of failures in simple digital networks. Production system modelling suggested that students using a common but simpler backtracking strategy would learn the more advanced elimination strategy if they applied certain domain-specific knowledge and the general-purpose problem-solving strategy of reductio ad absurdum. In an experiment, students solved network troubleshooting problems after being trained with either the domain-specific knowledge, the reductio ad absurdum strategy, both types of knowledge, or neither. Students needed both the domain-specific and general knowledge identified by the models in order to significantly increase their elimination use.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1354-6783			WOS:000246874900004

Modeling long-term plutonium transport in the Savannah River Site vadose zone								VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL				6	2			344	353		10.2136/vzj2006.0042			MAY 2007	2007	Improved understanding of fl ow and radionuclide transport in vadose zone sediments is fundamental to future planning involving radioactive materials. To that end, long-term experiments were conducted at the Savannah River Site (SRS), where a series of lysimeters containing sources of different Pu oxidation states were placed in the shallow subsurface and exposed to the environment for 2 to 11 yr. After the experiments, Pu activity concentrations were measured along vertical cores from the lysimeters. Plutonium distributions were anomalous in nature - transport from oxidized Pu sources was less than expected, and a small fraction of Pu from reduced sources moved more. Studies conducted with these lysimeter sediments indicated that surface-mediated, oxidation - reduction ( redox) reactions may be responsible for the anomalies. This hypothesis is tested by performing transient Pu transport simulations that include retardation and first-order redox reactions on mineral surfaces within a steady-state flow field. These simulations affirm the consistency of the surface-mediated, redox hypothesis with observed Pu activity profiles below the source. Such profiles are captured well by a steady-state, net downward fl ow model. The redox model explains how Pu(V/VI) sources release activity that moves downward more slowly than expected, and how Pu(III/IV) sources result in a small fraction of activity that moves downward farther than expected. The calibrated parameter values were robust and well defined throughout all simulations. Approximate retardation factors for Pu(V/VI) were 15, and for Pu(III/IV) were 10,000. For these values, k(o) averaged 2.4 x 10(-7) h(-1); kr averaged 7.1 x 10(-4) h(-1) (standard deviations are 1.6 x 10(-7) h(-1) and 1.6 x 10(-4) h(-1) respectively).									10	0	0	4	0	10			1539-1663			WOS:000248503000015

Environmental availability of uranium in an acidic plume at the Savannah River Site								VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL				6	2			354	362		10.2136/vzj2006.0072			MAY 2007	2007	Uranium partitioning in soils collected from an acid and U impacted sandy Coastal Plain aquifer at the Savannah River Site (SRS) was investigated. The influences of hydrologic regime (vadose zone or saturated zone), proximity to the source input ( impacted or unimpacted soils), and soil weathering (field or laboratory-spiked soils) on the environmental availability U were examined. Environmental availability ( availability for groundwater transport) was operationally defined using a sequential extraction technique and was applied to vadose zone, saturated zone, and background soils. For saturated zone locations, matched porewater-soil sets of field samples were collected, and data generated from these samples were used to examine U partitioning under field conditions. Laboratory batch sorption studies of uranyl ion to background soils were conducted as a function of pH. Subsequently, the soil used in the sorption study was subjected to sequential extraction to investigate the environmental availability in laboratory spiked samples. Based on sequential extraction behavior of U-impacted soils and background soils and the acidic plume chemistry, U concentrations in the fi rst three sequential extraction steps [deionized water, CaCl2, and acetic acid/Ca(NO3)(2)] were operationally defined as available, and the final two extraction steps (crystalline iron oxide and residual extraction steps) were operationally defined as unavailable. Based on this operational definition, soils impacted by the acidic U plume exhibited a greater fraction of available and total U. Vadose-zone soils had a smaller fraction of available U than corresponding saturated zone samples. Sequential extractions of U sorbed to background soils in a short-term laboratory experiment showed greater U availability compared with field soils collected within the contaminant plume. Field-derived K-d values ranged from 0.1 to 300 L kg(-1) and were highly correlated with porewater pH.									12	0	0	8	0	12			1539-1663			WOS:000248503000016

The original membrane filtration properties were characterized with deionized water to provide a baseline of membrane performance. At high volumetric concentration of the test solutions, greater than 98% rejection of dye and sodium sulfate were obtained. Rejection of buffering chemicals was approximately 50% in all experiments, giving a permeate water not suitable for reuse in most dyeing operations. The final composite concentrate had a chemical oxygen demand (COD) value >2000 mg/L. No problems were encountered with anaerobic treatment of the concentrate obtained from the dyeing wastewater. Adjusting the sulfate concentration to give COD-to-sulfate ratios to 2.9, 5.4, and 18.2 in the reactor feed had no significant alterations in the performance of the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor.									10	0	0	7	0	10			1061-4303			WOS:000246732900006	17571839

Additionally, common cocklebur achenes were collected in fall of 2003 and of 2004 to assess changes in tight and temperature requirements for germination over a 12-mo period under field conditions. Common cocklebur germination in response to the light environment and to constant and fluctuating temperatures were evaluated under controlled conditions following achene retrieval from the Field. There was a linear inverse relationship between shade intensity and soil thermal amplitude, which explained 77% of the variability in emergence in the field over 2 yr. Emergence decreased as soil thermal amplitude declined, with 95% shading resulting in a 72 to 88% reduction in emergence. Neither red nor far-red light had much effect on germination, and burial did not induce a light requirement. Germination of achenes retrieved from the soil surface or buried in soil generally was not affected by red or far-red light, and the achenes did not acquire a red-light requirement following burial. Daily exposure to natural greenhouse light at 24 to 30 C was essential for germination immediately following achene maturation, whereas no germination occurred in darkness. A thermal fluctuation of 15 C increased germination percentages over those at constant temperatures regardless of time after maturation or retrieval-depth of achenes. The mean fluctuating temperature over all sample dates that was generally optimal for germination was 25 C (17-5/32.5 C low/high temperatures; 15 C daily fluctuation) in April or May and July or August in both years. Germination was generally Optimum at constant temperatures of 35 or 40 C. The higher mean temperature requirement for germination at constant temperatures than at fluctuating temperatures likely contributes to reduced emergence in spring and summer months, when earlier emerging weed species or crops have already become established, and the thermal fluctuation requirement for germination reduces the likelihood of emergence in an environment where light availability is diminished.									11	0	0	8	3	13			0043-1745			WOS:000246418600006		
J	Norsworthy, Jason K.; Jha, Prashant; Bridges, William, Jr.								Sicklepod (Senna obtusifolia) survival and fecundity in wide- and narrow-row glyphosate-resistant soybean								WEED SCIENCE				55	3			252	259		10.1614/WS-06-155.1			MAY-JUN 2007	2007	Experiments were conducted to determine the influence of soybean row width and glyphosate application timing on survival, biomass production, and fecundity of three sicklepod cohorts along with soybean seed yield. The first cohort comprised sicklepod plants that emerged from soybean planting through the V3 stage of soybean (two fully developed trifoliate leaves plus the unifoliate leaves; cohort 1). The second cohort comprised plants that emerged between the V3 to V6 stages of soybean (five fully developed trifoliate leaves plus the unifoliate leaves; cohort 2), and the third cohort emerged after the V6 stage through the R2 stage of soybean (full bloom; cohort 3). Glyphosate was applied at V3; V6; V3 and V6; and V3, V6, and R2 in rows 19 and 97 cm wide, and a nontreated control was included for comparison in each row width. Survival of cohort 1 in 2004 in glyphosate-treated plots occurred only after a single glyphosate application at V3 or V6 in wide rows. Narrowing the soybean row width reduced sicklepod survival throughout the growing season, even without glyphosate. Total biomass production from all cohorts averaged over years was 1,602 g m- 2 in wide rows compared with 648 g m(-2) 2 in narrow rows. Cohort 1 accounted for 70 and 77% of the total sicklepod biomass in wide and narrow rows, respectively. Cohort 2 contributed 29% of the total sicklepod biomass in wide rows and 22% in narrow rows. Cohort 3 produced minimal biomass, contributing no more than 1% of the total sicklepod biomass. Sicklepod emerging after V6 failed to produce seed in 2004, and no sicklepod seed were produced in 2005 by 2 plants emerging after V3. Averaged over years, 2 sicklepod from cohort 1 in nontreated controls produced 3,695 seed m(-2) in narrow rows compared with 6,685 seed m(-2) in wide rows. Nontreated sicklepod from cohort 2 in 2004 produced 510 seed m(-2) in narrow rows compared with 1,640 seed m(-2) in wide rows. Soybean yields were similar among all glyphosate applications averaged over years and row widths, ranging from 3,340 to 3,700 kg ha(-1) compared with 1,290 kg ha(-1) without glyphosate (61 to 65% yield loss).									9	0	0	9	0	9			0043-1745			WOS:000246418600010		
J	Li, Qinglin; Chen, Jiquan; Song, Bo; LaCroix, Jacob J.; Bresee, Mary K.; Radmacher, John A.				Chen, Jiquan/D-1955-2009				Areas influenced by multiple edges and their implications in fragmented landscapes								FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT				242	2-3			99	107		10.1016/j.foreco.2006.11.022			APR 30 2007	2007	We introduced a new approach for delineating areas of multiple edge influence (AMEI) within a fragmented landscape using a geographic information system (GIs). AMEI was defined as the interface that is affected by more than two neighboring patch types. We decomposed AMEI into three components: AMEI(1), the area where one patch type meets a different patch type; AMEI(2), the area where one patch type meets two different patch types; AMEI(3), the area where one patch type meets three or more other different patch types. This approach provides a direct measure of the complexities of multiple edge effects that may occur at a spatial location, and also measures the amount of the affected area at the patch and landscape levels. Using the Chequamegon National Forest (CNF), USA, as a case study, we found that the total AMEI was approximately 48, 74, 86, and 92% of the landscape with depth of edge influence (DEI) at 30, 60, 90, and 120 m, respectively. The more complicated components of the area of multiple edge influence (AMEI(2) and AMEI(3)) ranged from 5% (at 30 m DEI) to 60% (at 120 m DEI) of the studied landscape. Most empirical and modeling studies miss this additional edge complexity if they only consider a single edge structure. In general, AMEI(1) is greater than AMEI(2); AMEI(2) is greater than AMEI(3). Three indices - AMEI to patch area ratio (APAR), AMEI to patch edge area ratio (APEAR), and AMEI to landscape area ratio (ALAR) - were introduced to explain the relative importance of AMEI at the edge, patch, and landscape levels. This approach has the potential to improve model predictions and better inform us about ecological processes that are influenced by multiple edge effects at patch and landscape scales.

Anionic synthesis of epoxy end-capped polymers								MACROMOLECULAR CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS				208	8			807	814		10.1002/macp.200600660			APR 16 2007	2007	The reaction of living anions of polystyrene (PS) or poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) with epibromohydrin for the synthesis of well-defined epoxy end-functionalized polymers is reported. Polyanions were reacted with an excess of epibromohydrin in tetrahydrofuran (THF) at -78 degrees C. The functionalities of the resulting polymers were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), NMR, and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The epoxy end groups were reacted with 1,1-diphenyl- hexyllithium, and MALDI-TOF MS and NMR before and after this chemical modification were used to determine the presence of the epoxy end groups. The presence of the epoxy end group was confirmed by anionically polymerizing ethylene oxide from these epoxy end group. The formation of a block copolymer due to the epoxy end groups was proved by SEC analysis. The combined MALDI-TOF MS, H-1 NMR, and SEC results indicate that epoxy end-capped PS was obtained in quantitative yield. The method was extended to the synthesis of epoxy end-capped PMMA. With this polymer the extent of end-functionalization was high but not quantitative, with non-dimeric byproducts detected by MALDI-TOF MS.									10	0	0	0	0	10			1022-1352			WOS:000246215400001

Analysis of total mercury in fish from these lentic systems consistently indicate elevated concentrations (> 1 mu g-g(-1) wet weight; hereinafter, all concentrations are reported as wet weight unless indicated otherwise) well above the U.S. Environmenal Protection Agency's human consumption advisory level for fish (< 0.3 mu g-g(-1)). Replicate X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) analyses on largemouth bass and hybrid striped bass from GUA and LAH were performed to determine predominant chemical species of mercury accumulated by these high-trophic-level piscivores that are exposed to elevated mercury through trophic transfer in mining-impacted lentic systems. Despite distinct differences in mercury source, the proximity of the source, and concentrations of complexing ligands, results of XANES analysis clearly indicated that mercury accumulated in these individual fish from the two reservoirs were dominated by methylmercury cysteine complexes. These findings are consistent with results from commercial fish species inhabiting marine environments which are presumed to include differing mercury sources (e.g., atmospheric, hydrothermal, or benthic). The dominance of methylmercury cysteine complexes in muscle tissues of fish obtained from such contrasting environments and exposure conditions suggests that a generic toxicological model for the consumption of fish could be applicable over a wide range of ecologic settings.									36	1	0	23	0	37			0013-936X			WOS:000245892900022	17533833

D. magna were able to ingest the nanotubes through normal feeding behavior and utilize the lysophophatidylcholine coating as a food source. D. magna were able to modify the solubility of the nanotube, likely through digestion of the lipid coating. This study provides evidence of biomodification of a carbon-based nanomaterial by an aquatic organism. The modification significantly altered the physical properties of the nanomaterial in freshwater. Acute toxicity was observed only in the highest test concentrations. These are important findings related to determining the behavior and potential toxicity of coated nanomaterials released into the environment.									195	11	1	154	1	210			0013-936X			WOS:000245892900063	17533874

In order to study the gas in inner disks, we have obtained high-resolution K-and M-band spectroscopy of 14 intermediate-mass young stars. In sources that have optically thick inner disks, i.e., E(K-L) > 1, our detection rate of the rovibrational CO transitions is 100%, and the gas is thermally excited. Of the five sources that do not have optically thick inner disks, we only detect the rovibrational CO transitions from HD 141569. In this case, we show that the gas is excited by UV fluorescence and that the inner disk is devoid of gas and dust. We discuss the plausibility of the various scenarios for forming this inner hole. Our modeling of the UV-fluoresced gas suggests an additional method by which to search for and/or place stringent limits on gas in dust-depleted regions in disks around Herbig Ae/Be stars.									82	0	0	0	0	82			0004-637X			WOS:000245773300057

Elastin stabilization for treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms								CIRCULATION				115	13			1729	1737		10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.672873			APR 3 2007	2007	Background-Maintaining the integrity of arterial elastin is vital for the prevention of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) development. We hypothesized that in vivo stabilization of aortic elastin with pentagalloyl glucose (PGG), an elastin-binding polyphenol, would interfere with AAA development.Methods and Results-Safety and efficacy of PGG treatment were first tested in vitro using cytotoxicity, elastin stability, and PGG-elastin interaction assays. For in vivo studies, the efficacy of PGG was evaluated within a well-established AAA model in rats on the basis of CaCl2-mediated aortic injury. With this model, PGG was delivered periadventitially at 2 separate time points during the course of AAA development; aortic diameter, elastin integrity, and other pathological aspects were monitored and evaluated in PGG-treated aortas compared with saline-treated control aortas. Our results show that a one-time periadventitial delivery of noncytotoxic levels of PGG inhibits elastin degeneration, attenuates aneurysmal expansion, and hinders AAA development in rats without interfering with the pathogenic mechanisms typical of this model, namely inflammation, calcification, and high metalloproteinase activities. PGG binds specifically to arterial elastin and, in doing so, preserves the integrity of elastic lamellae despite the presence of high levels of proteinases derived from inflammatory cells.Conclusions-Periadventitial administration of PGG hinders the development of AAA in a clinically relevant animal model. Stabilization of aortic elastin in aneurysm-prone arterial segments offers great potential toward the development of safe and effective therapies for AAAs.									53	7	0	41	0	61			0009-7322			WOS:000245402300009	17372168

Only five of these 11 gamma Doradus stars appear to be single; two are primaries of double-lined spectroscopic binaries, one is the secondary of a double-lined binary, two are primaries of visual binaries and, in the case of the double-lined binary (HD 86371), either or both components could be a pulsating gamma Doradus star. We have determined a preliminary orbital period of 5.32 days for the double-lined binary HD 41547. Several of the stars show spectroscopic line-profile and low-amplitude radial velocity variability indicative of pulsation. All 11 stars are photometrically variable with amplitudes between 4 and 94 mmag in Johnson B and periods between 0.38 and 1.86 days. The 11 stars have between two and five independent periods. The variability at all periods approximates a sinusoid. We provide a new tabulation of all 66 gamma Doradus stars confirmed to date and list some of their properties. All are dwarfs or subgiants and lie within a well-defined region of the H-R diagram that overlaps the cool edge of the delta Scuti instability strip. Four of the new gamma Doradus variables from this paper also lie within the delta Scuti instability strip but do not exhibit the additional higher frequency variability typical of delta Scuti stars. Among the 66 confirmed gamma Doradus variables, we find no correlation between the period of the strongest pulsation mode and the (B-V) color index, absolute magnitude, or luminosity.									20	0	0	0	0	20			0004-6256			WOS:000245543700020		
J	Moran, Amy L.; Allen, Jonathan D.				Moran, Amy/F-7072-2011				How does metabolic rate scale with egg size? An experimental test with sea urchin embryos								BIOLOGICAL BULLETIN				212	2			143	150					APR 2007	2007	The consequences of changes in egg size for the development of marine invertebrates have been the subject of much theoretical and experimental work. Models that explore larval developmental modes in the context of maternal investment per offspring are often couched in an energetic framework, but the relationships between egg size and the energetics of larval development are poorly understood. We used blastomere separations to examine how experimental reductions in egg size affected (1) larval metabolic rate and (2) larval resistance to starvation. We found that separating blastomeres at the 2- and 4-cell stage resulted in average reductions of 50% and 75%, respectively, in larval metabolic rate. This suggests that, in an experimental context, mass-specific metabolic rate does not change with egg size. We also found that a 50% reduction in egg volume did not reduce the resistance of larvae to starvation when particulate food was withheld. This suggests that the material supplied to larvae in the egg is used primarily for construction of the larval body, rather than as a buffer against starvation or as a means of reducing reliance on exogenous fuel to sustain maintenance metabolism.									15	0	0	12	0	15			0006-3185			WOS:000245933600006	17438206

These habitats exist within a disjunct occurrence of White Spruce at its southern limit of distribution in three mixed-grass prairie preserves in the Spruce Woods Provincial Park within the forest-prairie ecotone Of Southwestern Manitoba. Microenvironmental measurements (i.e.. light. temperature. relative humidity. soil moisture) were obtained on 10 sites in each of the three habitats and growth characteristics of 60 White Spruce seedlings were measured in each of three habitats. Higher light and Soil temperature conditions Occurred within the open prairie. In contrast, lower light and soil temperature conditions Occurred under the tree canopy of aspen groves and the northern aspect of spruce islands, which moderated the effect of the dry regional climate. Height growth did not vary significatly the three habitats. among The greater diameter growth and decreased slenderness of White Spruce Seedlings in the open versus the shaded habitats appearns to be a result of increased photosynthesis at higher fight intensity and may also represent it morphological adaptation to withstand the effect of increased wind exposure. The increased slenderness of White Spruce in the shaded habitats appears to be a morphological adaptation of increasing carbon allocation towards height growth and thus maximizing effective competition for light.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0008-3550			WOS:000261389700011

Upon further heating to 1000 degrees C, glassy carbon with high yield (> 80%) is formed from the polynaphthalene precursor. Dilatometry was used to determine the linear coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of various BODA-derived glassy carbon. The measured CTE was similar to other glassy carbon-based systems ranging from 3.20 to 6.92 x 10(-6) C-1 over 20-1000 degrees C. An increase in short-range order was apparent when polynaphthalene networks were carbonized to 1500 degrees C; the CTE observed for such thermal cycling was 2.85-2.93 x 10(-6)degrees C-1 over 20-1000 degrees C. Using dilatometry also provided insight on the carbonization mechanism to provide optimization of glassy carbon yields during thermal cycling.

To the best of our knowledge, this paper reports for the first time a detailed study of NH3 decomposition on tungsten carbide (WC). Results for a commercially available Fe ammonia synthesis catalyst (Amomax-10) are also reported for comparison.The WC catalyst was characterized by BET, XRD, SEM, EDX and temperature programmed reaction (TPRx). The catalytic behavior of WC strongly depended on pretreatment conditions. The highest activity was obtained with WC samples pretreated in an 80/20 mixture of H-2-CO. Complete decomposition of NH3 was observed at 550 degrees C for 4000 ppm of NH3 at a space velocity of 1,884,000 h(-1). At lower temperatures, the activity of the WC catalyst reached steady-state after an induction period that decreased in time with increasing temperature. Reconstruction of the surface during pretreatment and during decomposition of NH3 is suggested to be responsible for the behavior of the catalyst observed during TPRx and time-on-stream (TOS) isothermal reaction. The commercial Fe NH3 synthesis catalyst, although active for NH3 decomposition, showed rapid partial deactivation following an induction period with a steady-state conversion of only 35% at 650 degrees C and the space velocity used. Thus, WC appears to be an excellent catalyst for use in ammonia decomposition. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									22	0	0	2	0	22			1566-7367			WOS:000245793300003

The catalysts studied included a zeolite (H beta), two modified zirconias (sulfated zirconia, SZ; and tungstated zirconia, WZ), and an acidic resin-silica composite (Nafion/silica, SAC-13). Activities on a per weight basis decreased in the following order: H beta similar to SAC-13 >> SZ > WZ at 130 degrees C. However, on a rate-per-site basis (TOF), all catalysts showed comparable activities. The TOF results suggest that the acid sites of these catalysts have similar capacity for effectively catalyzing esterification. All catalysts deactivated to a quasi-steady-state rate with TOS. Regeneration experiments suggested that catalyst deactivation was due mainly to site blockage by carbonaceous deposits. Selective poisoning experiments showed that the reaction predominately took place on Bronsted acid sites.									21	0	0	1	0	21			1011-372X			WOS:000245703400002

Genetic variation among Ambystoma breeding populations on the savannah river site								CONSERVATION GENETICS				8	2			281	292		10.1007/s10592-006-9168-z			APR 2007	2007	We surveyed 16 Carolina bay breeding ponds for Ambystoma salamanders. Tail tissue samples were collected from adult and juvenile mole salamanders (A. talpoideum), marbled salamanders (A. opacum), and spotted salamanders (A. maculatum) captured leaving the Carolina bays. We used amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) to determine the genetic variation associated with the breeding populations. The Carolina bays could be considered as individual populations, metapopulation groups, or as one big metapopulation depending on gene flow between these bays. Bays range from less than 100 m apart to more than 24 km apart, much further than any reported movement for these species. Animals were marked in the field. We documented little movement of salamanders between breeding locations. Using 392 polymorphic bands produced with the AFLP technique, we were able to separate the samples into the correct species from which the tissues were collected. However, within species analyses failed to find structure associated with populations of salamanders. We failed to document a correlation between geographic and genetic distance (Mantel r = 0.05235, P=0.6800 for mole salamanders; r = 0.46077, P=0.9547 for marbled salamanders). Only 27.8% of mole salamanders and 60.9% of marbled salamanders were assigned back to the population of capture. The majority of the genetic variation was attributable to the individual as opposed to the population. The results of this study suggest that while the majority of these salamanders may be philopatric, some mixing maybe occurring or alternatively, that these populations have not been genetically isolated for sufficient time to develop unique genotypes through drift.									5	0	0	4	0	5			1566-0621			WOS:000244685400003		
J	Aue, Alexander; Horvath, Lajos								A limit theorem for mildly explosive autoregression with stable errors								ECONOMETRIC THEORY				23	2			201	220		10.1017/S0266466607070090			APR 2007	2007	We discuss the limiting behavior of the serial correlation coefficient in mildly explosive autoregression, where the error sequence is in the domain of attraction of an alpha-stable law, alpha is an element of (0,2]. Therein, the autoregressive coefficient rho = rho(n) > 1 is assumed to satisfy the condition rho(n) -> 1 such that n(rho(n) - 1) -> infinity as n -> infinity. In contrast to the vast majority of existing literature in the area, no specific form of rho is required. We show that the serial correlation coefficient converges in distribution to a ratio of two independent stable random variables.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0266-4666			WOS:000244375200001

Its organization and incentive structures differed importantly from contemporaneous private sailing ventures, but closely resembled those of today's large corporations. To induce efficient effort, the navy used a hierarchical tournament, in which sailors competed for higher pay that came with promotions based on relative performance. Promotion probabilities, the option value of future promotions, and the higher effort required of men in higher ranks and on larger vessels, combined to yield a highly skewed pay structure.

This extraordinary experiment took place in excavations at Corinth, where American archaeologists invented the systematic discipline of medieval archaeology, facilitated an inclusive identity for the American School, and contributed to a bohemian undercurrent that would have a long afterlife. This article situates the birth of Byzantine archaeology in Greece within the general discourse of modernism and explores the mechanisms of interchange across disciplinary and national boundaries, between subjective and objective realms.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0018-098X			WOS:000249640200006		
J	Rapaka, Vijaya Kumar; Faust, James E.; Dole, John M.; Runkle, Erik S.								Effect of time of harvest on postharvest leaf abscission in lantana (Lantana camara L. 'Dallas Red') unrooted cuttings								HORTSCIENCE				42	2			304	308					APR 2007	2007	This study investigated the preharvest carbohydrate status and postharvest ethylene action of unrooted shoot-tip cuttings of lantana 'Dallas Red' harvested at three times during the day (0800, 1200, and 1600 HR) in relation to subsequent leaf abscission, shoot apices blackening, and adventitious root formation. The cuttings harvested at various times during the day were stored in darkness at 20 +/- 1 degrees C for 4 days in sealed polyethylene bags. The cuttings harvested at 0800 HR had lowest total nonstructural carbohydrate concentrations; however, the amount of ethylene production during postharvest storage was similar among harvest times and increased during the storage period. After 4 days of storage, 69% of the leaves of cuttings harvested at 0800 HR abscised, but only 22% and 8% of the leaves abscised in cuttings harvested at 1200 and 1600 HR, respectively. Application of 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) increased ethylene production and suppressed leaf abscission regardless of the harvest time, but cuttings harvested at 0800 HR developed blackened shoot apices. Leaf abscission was negatively correlated with total nonstructural carbohydrate concentration in the leaves, but no relationship was found with ethylene production. These results indicate that a high endogenous carbohydrate status decreases the postharvest ethylene sensitivity in unrooted shoot-tip cuttings of lantana. Time of harvest influenced subsequent rooting response; however, I-MCP application did not inhibit rooting. Among various storage treatments, the best rooting response was observed in cuttings harvested at 1600 HR and treated with 1-MCP. Therefore, significant improvement of postharvest storage quality in vegetative lantana cuttings could be achieved by harvesting cuttings late in the day and treating with I-MCP.									7	0	0	4	0	7			0018-5345			WOS:000245365600025		
J	Adelberg, Jeffrey; Delgado, Maria; Tomkins, Jeffrey								In vitro sugar and water use in diploid and tetraploid genotypes of daylily (Hemerocallis spp.) in liquid medium as affected by density and plant growth regulators								HORTSCIENCE				42	2			325	328					APR 2007	2007	Two tetraploid and two diploid genotypes of Hemerocallis spp. were micro-propagated on an orbital shaker in Murashige and Skoog liquid medium in a factorial combination of two sucrose concentrations (90 mm and 180 mm), two 6-benzylamino-purine (benzyladenine) concentrations (0.32 mu M and 3.2 mu M), at two densities (57 explants/L and 171 explants/L), in the presence (0.32 mu M) and absence of alpha-cyclopyl-alpha-[4-mehtoxyphenyl]-5-pyrimididinmethanol (ancymidol). There were linear relationships between fresh weight and water use (R(2) = 0.800, p < 0.0001), dry weight and sucrose Use (R(2) = 0.636, P < 0.0001), and relative dry weight (dry weight/fresh weight = relative dry weight) to concentration of sucrose residual in medium after culture (R(2) = 0.553, P < 0.0001). Eighty-five percent of the water used and 74% of the sucrose used were incorporated as plant fresh weight and dry weight, respectively. A 1% increase in percent sucrose residual (mass/volume in spent medium) was correlated to an increase of 1.8% relative dry weight over the range 7% to 22% relative dry weight. In vessels with 90 mm initial sucrose, where the most growth had occurred (> 15 g fresh weight), sucrose was depleted (< 0.2% sucrose) and plantlets had the lowest relative dry weight (approximate to 6.9%). In vessels from 180 mm initial sucrose, with similarly high fresh weight, plantlets had 12.0% relative dry weight with 2.1% sucrose residual in medium. Fresh weight, dry weight, or relative dry weight of plantlets in the laboratory did not correlate with subsequent survival or growth in the greenhouse. Plantlets grown without ancymidol at the lower benzyladenine concentration acclimatized to the greenhouse with 93% survival. However, greenhouse survival of plants grown with ancymidol and a higher level of benzyladenine was only 4%. 'Barbara Mitchell' was the largest plant in the laboratory, but often had poorest growth in the greenhouse. When optimizing a liquid micro-propagation protocol for larger vessels, sucrose and water requirements may be directly related to targeted biomass yield, but each genotype needs to be handled independently with ex vitro validation of plant vigor.									6	0	0	5	0	6			0018-5345			WOS:000245365600029

Human error and commercial aviation accidents: An analysis using the human factors analysis and classification system								HUMAN FACTORS				49	2			227	242		10.1518/001872007X312469			APR 2007	2007	Objective: The aim of this study was to extend previous examinations of aviation accidents to include specific aircrew, environmental, supervisory, and organizational factors associated with two types of commercial aviation (air carrier and commuter/on-demand) accidents using the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS). Background: HFACS is a theoretically based tool for investigating and analyzing human error associated with accidents and incidents. Previous research has shown that HFACS can be reliably used to identify human factors trends associated with military and general aviation accidents. Method: Using data obtained from both the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration, 6 pilot-raters classified aircrew, supervisory, organizational, and environmental causal factors associated with 1020 commercial aviation accidents that occurred over a 13-year period. Results: The majority of accident causal factors were attributed to aircrew and the environment, with decidedly fewer associated with supervisory and organizational causes. Comparisons were made between HFACS causal categories and traditional situational variables such as visual conditions, injury severity, and regional differences. Conclusion: These data will provide support for the continuation, modification, and/or development of interventions aimed at commercial aviation safety. Application: HFACS provides a tool for assessing human factors associated with accidents and incidents.									86	11	0	23	3	97			0018-7208			WOS:000244903900006	17447665

This paper describes a method for improving the low-frequency performance of existing full-wave boundary element techniques and demonstrates how the full-wave model can be used to solve static electric field problems. The new approach performs linear transformations on the moment matrix utilizing an LU decomposition and matrix reconstruction. It does not require special basis functions and is relatively easy to implement in existing boundary element codes. Examples presented demonstrate how modified full-wave software is capable of calculating static field and charge distributions for a variety of configurations using the same algorithms and the same input used to do high-frequency calculations.					12th Biennial IEEE Conference on Electromagnetic Field Computation12th Biennial IEEE Conference on Electromagnetic Field Computation	APR 30-MAY 03, 2006APR 30-MAY 03, 2006	IEEEIEEE	Miami, FLMiami, FL	0	0	0	0	0	0			0018-9464	1941-0069		WOS:000245327200025

Comparison of pulse shape discrimination methods for phoswich and CsI : T1 detectors								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NUCLEAR SCIENCE				54	2			398	403		10.1109/TNS.2007.892943			APR 2007	2007	Comparison of four pulse shape discrimination (PSD) methods was performed on the same digitized pulses from two different detector configurations. Beta/gamma discrimination of Sr-90 and Cs-137 was performed using a phoswich detector made of BC400 and BGO scintillators. Alpha/gamma discrimination of 2 (10)P0 and Cs-137 was performed using a CsI:TI scintillation crystal. The pulse waveforms were digitized with a DGF-4C and analyzed offline with IGOR Pro software. The four pulse shape discrimination methods that were compared include: constant fraction discrimination (CFD), rise time discrimination (RTD), constant time discrimination (CTD), and charge comparison (CC). The CTD method resulted in a spillover of 9.2% (Figure of Merit, FOM = 3.9) and 0.25% (FOM = 3.2), while the CC method resulted in a spillover of 9.9% (FOM = 3.3) and 0.033% (FOM = 3.7) for the phoswich and CsI:TI detectors, respectively. Although the CTD results in the lowest spillover for high signal-to-noise pulses, the optimized CC method, as e best PSD method overall. implemented here, appears to be the, Analysis of the reciprocal of the pulse shape data typically resulted in a significantly higher FOM than conventional methods with no reduction in spillover. This simple mathematical transformation of the pulse shape data illustrates that the FOM may not be a good scheme for the quantification of PSD.									13	1	0	3	0	13			0018-9499			WOS:000246171100014

Effects of steric constraint on chromium(III) complexes of tetraazamacrocycles, 4: Comparison of the trans-difluoro-complexes of tet a, 1,4-C-2-cyclam, and 1,11-C-3-cyclam								INORGANICA CHIMICA ACTA				360	5			1482	1492		10.1016/j.ica.2006.08.037			APR 1 2007	2007	The synthesis and characterization of the trans-difluorochromium(III) complexes of the constrained macrocyclic ligands 1,4-C-2-cyclam = 1,4,8,1 1-tetraazabicyclo[10.2.2]hexadecane and 1,11-C-3-cyclam = 1,4,8,11-tetraazabicyclo[9.3.3]heptadecane is reported. Only trans complexes are formed, and the structures of both trans-[Cr(1,4-C-2-cyclam)F-2]ClO4 and trans-[Cr(1,11-C-3-cyclam)F-2]CIO4 are presented. The photochemical and photophysical behavior of the 1,4-C-2-cyclam and 1, 11-C-3-cyclam complexes is compared with that of the corresponding tet a (C-meso-5,7,7,12,14,14-hexamethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane) complex. The constraint imposed by the additional bridging groups of 1,4-C-2-cyclam and 1, 11-C-3-cyclam distorts the complexes away from both octahedral symmetry and centrosymmetry, as evidenced by the bond angles that deviate from ideal 90 degrees and 180 degrees values and by a significant distortion of the Cr(N-4) plane. This reduction in symmetry correlates with a monotonic increase in the extinction coefficients in going from the tet a to the 1, 11-C-3-cyclam, to the 1,4-C-2-cyclam complex. These three complexes also exhibit large variations in their aqueous room-temperature excited state behavior; namely, the lifetimes of the T-2(1g) (Oh) excited states are 30,60, and 1.0 mu s for the tet a, 1,11-C-3-cyclam, and 1,4-C-2-cyclam complexes, respectively. Studies of the excited-state lifetime of these complexes in acidified H2O/dimethyl sulfoxide over the temperature range between -30 and +95 degrees C suggest that the 1,4-C-2-cyclarn complex accesses a temperature-dependent relaxation mechanism at significantly lower temperatures than do the tet a or 1, 11-C-3-cyclam complexes. The emission behavior of these complexes is also solvent-dependent, consistent with established theories that the degree of splitting of the emitting T-2(1g) (Oh) state varies with the hydroxylic nature of the solvent.

These nontraditional requirements are sometimes an objective as when the desirability of a schedule increases with the number of jobs of the same color that are scheduled consecutively. Other times, the requirements take the form of constraints as in cases where it is forbidden to have more than two consecutive jobs with a particular color. To complicate the situation, most real scheduling problems are multiobjective. This research centers on bicriteria scheduling with nontraditional requirements using an experimental approach and a Random Keys Genetic Algorithm to find Pareto optimal solutions. We address both traditional and nontraditional requirements in a single machine job shop with 20-50 jobs. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Residence time and food contact time effects on transfer of Salmonella Typhimurium from tile, wood and carpet: testing the five-second rule								JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY				102	4			945	953		10.1111/j.1365-2672.2006.03171.x			APR 2007	2007	Aims: Three experiments were conducted to determine the survival and transfer of Salmonella Typhimurium from wood, tile or carpet to bologna (sausage) and bread. Methods and Results: Experiment 1. After 28 days, 1.5 to 2.5 log(10) CFU cm(-2) remained on tile from and the more concentrated media facilitated the survival of S. Typhimurium compared with the more dilute solutions.Experiments 2 and 3. The bacterial transfer rate to food decreased as the bacterial residence time on the surface increased from 2, 4, 8 to 24 h with transfers of 6.5, 4.8, 4.6 and 3.9 log CFU ml(-1) in the rinse solutions, respectively. Over 99% of bacterial cells were transferred from the tile to the bologna after 5 s of bologna exposure to tile. Transfer from carpet to bologna was very low (< 0.5%) when compared with the transfer from wood and tile (5-68%). Conclusions: (i) Salmonella Typhimurium can survive for up to 4 weeks on dry surfaces in high-enough populations to be transferred to foods and (ii) S. Typhimurium can be transferred to the foods tested almost immediately on contact. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study demonstrated the ability of bacteria to survive and cross-contaminate other foods even after long periods of time on dry surfaces, thus reinforcing the importance of sanitation on food contact to minimize the risk of foodborne illness.									26	3	0	18	2	31			1364-5072			WOS:000245101100007	17381737

In vitro study of flow regulation for pulmonary insufficiency								JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICAL ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME				129	2			284	288		10.1115/1.2540892			APR 2007	2007	Given the tolerance of the right heart circulation to mild regurgitation and gradient, we study the potential of using motionless devices to regulate the pulmonary circulation. In addition, we document the flow performance of two mechanical valves. A motionless diode, a nozzle, a mechanical bileaflet valve, and a tilting disk valve were tested in a pulmonary mock circulatory system over the normal human range of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). For the mechanical valves, regurgitant fractions (RFs) and transvalvular pressure gradients were found to be weak functions of PVR. On the low end of normal PVR, the bileaflet and tilting disk valves fluttered and would not fully close. Despite this anomaly, the regurgitant fraction of either valve did not change significantly. The values for RF and transvalvular gradient measured varied from 4 to 7% and 4 to 7 mm Hg, respectively, at 5 lpm for all tests. The diode valve was able to regulate flow with mild regurgitant fraction and trivial gradient but with values higher than either mechanical valve tested. Regurgitant fraction ranged from 2 to 17% in tests extending from PVR values of 1 to 4.5 mm Hg/lpm at 5 lpm and with concomitant increases in gradient up to 17 mm Hg. The regurgitant fraction for the nozzle increased from 2 to 23% over the range of PVR with gradients increasing to 18 mm Hg. The significant findings were: (1) the mechanical valves controlled regurgitation at normal physiological cardiac output and PVR even though they failed to close at some normal values of PVR and showed leaflet flutter; and (2) it may be possible to regulate the pulmonary circulation to tolerable levels using a motionless pulmonary valve device.									4	0	0	2	0	4			0148-0731			WOS:000245784900018	17408334

Grafting amine-terminated branched architectures from poly(L-lactide) film surfaces for improved cell attachment								JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART B-APPLIED BIOMATERIALS				81B	1			142	152		10.1002/jbm.b.30647			APR 2007	2007	Poly (L-lactide) (PLL) has been used as a bioabsorbable material in the medical and pharmaceutical fields. The unmodified hydrophobic PLL surface generally has low cell affinity; thus, modification of PLL film surface properties is necessary to improve its use as a biomaterial. Our surface modification method involved the use of photografting and typical wet chemistry to create branched architectures containing amine functionalities on the periphery of the grafted layers. Amine (-NH2) groups were first introduced on the PLL film surface by photoinduced grafting of 4,4'-diaminobenzophenone and the grafted branched architectures were created by subsequent reactions with succinic acid and tris(2-aminoethyl) amine. The resulting film surface was analyzed using contact angle goniometry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. MC3T3 fibroblasts were cultured on unmodified PLL film and PLL films grafted with the branched structures and the films were subsequently analyzed by optical microscopy. The contact angle goniometry results showed an initial decrease and subsequent plateau in the water contact angles for the PLL films with each successive generation of the branched architectures. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data provided insight into the structure of the grafted layer and revealed an increase in the nitrogen content with each generation. Optical micrographs showed enhanced cell attachment and viability on the surface-modified PLL films.

Acetic acid and triacetin were used as model compounds for free fatty acids (FFAs) and triglycerides, respectively. Complex mixtures of FFAs and triglycerides are typical biodiesel precursors found in unrefined vegetable oils, animal fats, and waste greases. The effect of calcination temperature (400-900 degrees C) on the catalytic properties of WZ was investigated with the goal of determining the optimum pretreatment temperature and increasing the understanding of the nature of the active sites for esterification and transesterification. Catalyst characterization by powder X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, TGA, elemental analysis, and total BET surface area allowed us to correlate the changes in catalyst physicochemical proper-ties with calcination temperature. Ion-exchange/titration and NH3-TPD were used to characterize the number and strength of the acid sites. Esterification and transesterification rates (on a catalyst weight basis) increased with increasing surface WOx densities between 1.9 and 6.6 W-atoms nm(-2) and then decreased for densities above 6.6 W-atoms nm(-2). The growth of W03 crystalline species resulted in lower esterification and transesterification rates, consistent with a decrease in the number of active sites. For the catalyst that exhibited the optimum catalytic activity (calcined at 800 degrees C), selective poisoning of the potential catalytic centers revealed that Bronsted sites play the major role in carrying out these reactions.

Inspection of white layer in hard turned components using electrochemical methods								JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME				129	2			447	452		10.1115/1.2540655			APR 2007	2007	This paper presents the results of electrochemical tests oil hard turned steel components that have white layer oil the surface. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is used to compare a machined surface with white layer against a machined surface without white layer an annealed surface, and an electrical discharge machined surface. Measurements of the steady-state open-circuit potential are also used for comparison. The results show that the electrochemical properties of a surface with white layer are distinct from a surface without white layer. Specifically, a surface with white layer is more anodic and has lower electrochemical impedance than a surface without white layer in a NaOH solution. These results provide insight into the electrochemical properties of white layer and indicate that surfaces with white layer may corrode more quickly in service.									9	0	0	0	0	9			1087-1357			WOS:000246431100025

A simplified and generalized model for the rapid expansion of supercritical solutions								JOURNAL OF SUPERCRITICAL FLUIDS				40	3			402	419		10.1016/j.supflu.2006.08.005			APR 2007	2007	A set of analytical equations is derived for the estimation of the average diameter attained by particles that are generated by the rapid expansion of a supercritical solution (RESS). Applying the simplified model to one specific, but nevertheless representative set of experimental conditions for RESS processing, theoretical findings from earlier work could be generally confirmed and new insight was gained. Particles generated by RESS through an expansion device having a cylindrical section with a small aspect ratio will generally not attain average diameters of more than 20-50 nm before passing through the critical cross section since the time available for growth by condensation is limited to a few microseconds. Comparing three different driving mechanisms for growth due to coagulation, it was found that the effects of slip flow differences can be seen as most promising to significantly improve existing RESS models.

Since the first application of fused deposition modeling for tissue engineering scaffolds, considerable effort has been focused on printing synthetic biodegradable scaffolds. Concurrently a variety of rapid prototyping techniques have been developed to define macroscopically the shapes of deposited biomaterials, including photolithography, syringe-based gel deposition, and solid freeform fabrication. These designed scaffolds have shown promise in regenerating tissues at least equivalent to other scaffolding methods.An exciting advance in scaffold aided tissue regeneration is presented here, that of cell and organ printing, which allows direct printing of c ells and proteins within 3D bydrogel structures. Cell printing opens the possibility to programmed deposition of scaffold structure and cell type, thus controlling the type of tissue that can be regenerated within the scaffold. Several examples of printed tissues will be presented including contractile cardiac hybrids. The hybrid materials have properties that can be tailored in 3D to achieve desired porosities, mechanical and chemical properties. The materials include alginate hydrogels with controlled microshell structures that can be built by spraying cross-linkers onto ungelled alginic acid.Endothelial cells were seen to attach to the inside of these microshells. The cells remained viable in constructs as thick as I cm due to the programmed porosity. Finite element modeling was used to predict the mechanical properties and to generate CAD models with properties matching cardiac tissue. These results suggest that the printing method could be used for hierarchical design of functional cardiac patches, balanced with porosity for mass transport and structural support.

Precursor powders of the coprecipitation process were Ca-deficient nanoapatites (i.e., Ca/P molar ratiovarying from 1.49 to 1.51) with needlelike but agglomerated particles of 30 nm thickness. In vitro culture tests performed by mouse osteoblast-like cells showed that the samples doped with 2900 to 4 100 ppm Zn showed the highest cell viability (via Live/Dead counts), and with a further increase in the Zn-content towards 1 wt.% the number of dead cells in the well plates started to increase. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity peaked for the beta-TCP sample doped with 4 100 pm Zn. The sample surface roughness, measured by non-contact profilometry, was also found to have an effect on the Live/Dead cell counts, and the highest cell viability encountered in this study corresponded to the surface with the least roughness.

It was initially shown that sand-blasted or surface-roughened titanium implants had an improved bone-bonding ability over the bioinert metallic surfaces. Plasma-spraying of a phase mixture of loosely-attached calcium phosphates on titanium implants further improved their in vivo bone-bonding ability. However, stoichiometric calcium hydroxyapatite ceramic of high crystallinity is known to have poor in vivo resorbability, and is shy of taking part in bone remodeling and of being resorbed by the osteoclasts. Supersaturated calcium phosphate (CaP). solutions, such as synthetic body fluids (SBF), on the other hand, are able to form "carbonated, hydrophilic and apatite-like" CaP nanoaggregates on titanium surfaces. A Tris-buffered SBF solution with an HCO3- concentration of 27 mM was used in this study. Neat, NaOH-etched, and SBF-coated (biomimetic coating) titanium foams were compared with in vitro cell culture experiments by using rat osteoblasts. SBF-coated foams were found to yield the highest protein concentration at the end of the in vitro culture tests. Such biomimetic coatings were easily formed on flat strips, springs, or 3D foams of titanium, without any geometric constraints. The coated titanium springs and foams were characterized by using XRD, SEM, and FTIR. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Through the modification of existing nanostructured materials one can control and tailor the properties of such materials in a predictable manner, and impart them with biological properties and functionalities to better suit their integration with biomedical systems. These modified nanostructured materials can bring new and unique capabilities to a variety of biomedical applications ranging from implant engineering and modulated drug delivery, to clinical biosensors and diagnostics. This review describes recent advances of nanostructured materials for biomedical applications. The methods and technologies used to modify nanostructured materials are summarized briefly, while several current interests in biomedical applications for modified and functionalized. nanostructured materials are emphasized.

Single type of material may not be sufficient to mimic the composition, structure and properties of native bone, therefore, composite inaterials consisting of both polymers, bioceramics, and other inorganic materials have to be designed. Among a variety of candidate materials, polymer-nanoparticle composites appear most promising for bone tissue engineering applications because of superior mechanical properties, improved durability, and surface bioactivity when compared with conventional polymers or composites. The long term objective of this project is to use highly aligned, bioactive, biodegradable scaffold mimicking natural histological structure of human long bone, and to engineer and regenerate human long bone both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, bioactive, degradable, and highly permeable composite hollow fiber membranes (HFMs) were fabricated using a wet phase phase-inversion approach. The structure of the hollow fiber membranes was examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM); degradation behavior was examined using weigh loss assay, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC); and bioactivity was evaluated with the amount of calcium deposition from the culture media onto HFM surface. Doping PLGA HFMs with nanoHA results in a more bioactive and slower degrading HFM than pure PLGA HFMs. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

From among the various approximation concepts, this paper considers the notion of epsilon-efficient solutions and proposes several new methods for their generation. Supporting theoretical results are established and a numerical example is provided.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0171-6468			WOS:000244068800007

The authors' synthesis of complexity's supporting literatures leads them to conclude that complexity is a multidimensional construct that has been operationalized overly narrowly in many cases. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of industry-level data drawn from two periods support this conclusion and suggest that researchers should consider specifying a multidimensional measure of environmental complexity.									15	0	0	1	0	15			1094-4281			WOS:000245356800007

Instability of propiconazole resistance and fitness in Monilinia fructicola								PHYTOPATHOLOGY				97	4			448	453		10.1094/PHYTO-97-4-0448			APR 2007	2007	The fitness and the dynamics of demethylation inhibitor fungicide (DMI) sensitivity in isolates of Monilinia fructicola sensitive (no growth at 0.3 mg/liter propiconazole) and resistant (>= 50% relative growth at 0.3 mg/liter propiconazole) to propiconazole were investigated. Overall, there was no considerable compromise in the fitness of resistant isolates compared to sensitive isolates of M. fructicola at the time of collection. Resistant and sensitive isolates differed in their sensitivity to propiconazole (P < 0.001) and incubation period (P = 0.044), but not in latent period, growth rate, spore production, and spore germination frequency (P > 0.05). Consecutive transferring on potato dextrose agar had an impact on conidia production, conidial germination, and growth rate (P < 0.0001). Consecutive transferring also had an impact on propiconazole sensitivity in resistant isolates. In the resistant isolates, sensitivity to propiconazole increased (R-2 = 0.960, P = 0.0034) within the first eight transfers. Similarly, sensitivity to propiconazole increased by 273% over the course of 34 months in cold storage in propiconazole-resistant isolates. Our results show that propiconazole resistance is unstable in vitro and that standard subculturing and cold storage procedures impact propiconazole sensitivity of resistant isolates. The instability of propiconazole resistance in M. fructicola may have important implications for disease management in that a reversion to propiconazole sensitivity could potentially occur in the absence of DMI fungicide pressure in the field.									26	0	0	24	0	26			0031-949X			WOS:000245220200007	18943285

We report sedges (Cyperaccae) as hosts of the delphacids K flava Beamer, K parvicurvata Beamer, K spinosa Beamer, K torquata Beamer, K vesiculata Beamer, S. brunneus Beamer, S. lautus Van Duzee, and S. unipunctatus Provancher. Collections from the southern Appalachians (North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee) and upper Piedmont (South Carolina) are the first southeastern U.S. records for all of the planthopper species except K flava, K parvicurvata, and S. lautus. Stenocranus lautus was collected from Cyperus spp., but the other seven delphacids were associated with diverse Care-v spp. representing six sections of the genus. Hosts were generally common, widely distributed sedges. Stenocranus brunneus, however, was found on C. austrocaroliniana and C. radfordii, plant species of limited distribution and special concern. Taxonomic notes on the eight species are provided, as are morphological illustrations and notes on the habitats or communities in which they were found.									7	0	0	8	0	8			0013-8797			WOS:000245708100014

Women used more palliative coping; no gender differences were observed for psychosocial adaptation. Health care orientation, extended family relationships, and psychological distress domains distinguished Blacks born in Haiti from Blacks born in Barbados and Jamaica, the Southern US and Jamaica, and the Southern US, Barbados, and Jamaica. Findings from this study may aid in the development of interventions focused on improving diabetes self-management for older Blacks.

J	Mobley, Catherine								Breaking ground: Engaging undergraduates in social change through service learning								TEACHING SOCIOLOGY				35	2			125	137					APR 2007	2007	This paper describes a service-learning project designed for an upper-level sociology course in Policy and Social Change. The project, Breaking Ground, had two main goals: to change students' perceptions about persons who are homeless and to increase students' sense of efficacy for engaging in social advocacy. Through Breaking Ground, students formed a partnership with advocates and homeless clients to raise public awareness about homelessness and to organize advocacy and fund-raising events for the agency partner. The research element of the project used pre-tests and post-tests to assess changes in students' beliefs about social justice, self-efficacy, and perceptions of homelessness. When compared to students who took the class, but did not participate in the described service-learning project, Breaking Ground students experienced significant changes in a positive direction in their perceptions of individuals who are homeless. There were also some small changes in student feelings of self-efficacy and opinions on social justice. I explain these results and provide suggestions for implementation of similar projects.									16	0	0	0	0	16			0092-055X			WOS:000246133000002

TRENDS IN MICROBIOLOGY				15	4			150	155		10.1016/j.tim.2007.02.002			APR 2007	2007	Although the aceticlastic methanoarchaea Methanosarcina and Methanosaeta employ different enzymes to catalyze the first step of aceticlastic methanogenesis, it has long been assumed that the remainder of the pathway was the same. Analysis of the recently completed genome sequence of Methanosaeta thermophila confirms that the majority of core steps of the pathway are similar in both genera, but striking differences have been discovered in electron transfer and energy conservation. In addition, the presence of genes encoding enzymes for the CO2 reduction pathway in the Msa. thermophila genome suggests the possibility that Methanosaeta might be more metabolically diverse than previously thought. Thus, genome analysis of Msa. thermophila presents new research avenues for this forgotten methanogen and reminds us of the questions that still remain unanswered about aceticlastic methanogenesis in both Methanosaeta and Methanosarcina.									104	9	0	87	1	112			0966-842X			WOS:000246093700003	17320399

Field trials were conducted in 2003 and 2005 to evaluate bispyribac-sodium for annual bluegrass management in creeping bentgrass greens maintained at a 3 mm mowing height. Bispyribac-sodium applied weekly at 12 or 24 g ai/ha controlled annual bluegrass 86% 12 wk after initial treatment (WAIT). In 2003, bispyribac-sodium applied at 12 and 24 g/ha/wk injured creeping bentgrass approximately 15 and 50% by 4 WAIT, respectively. However, injury was transient and was not evident by 12 WAIT. In 2005, the 12 and 24 g/ha/wk injured creeping bentgrass 15 and 85% by 8 WAIT, respectively, and was still evident throughout the trial. Putting green quality was reduced when compared to nontreated creeping bentgrass by the same treatments. The removal of annual bluegrass caused soil exposure until creeping bentgrass grew over the bare areas, contributing to decreased quality evaluations. Management of annual bluegrass in creeping bentgrass putting greens is possible with bispyribac-sodium. However, these results indicate bispyribac-sodium can cause excessive injury when applied to creeping bentgrass mowed at 3 mm.									7	0	0	7	0	7			0890-037X			WOS:000247458400021

Surface-grafted, molecularly imprinted polymers grown from silica gel for chromatographic separations								INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH				46	7			2117	2124		10.1021/ie0606284			MAR 28 2007	2007	Imprinted polymers were grafted successfully from silica gel via atom-transfer radical polymerization. Measured binding kinetics for protected amino acid templates onto the molecularly imprinted polymers on silica gel (MIP-SG) and MIPs prepared by conventional solution-phase synthesis demonstrated that the MIP-SG had improved mass-transfer properties and also had higher binding capacity per unit mass of polymer. In addition, a high-performance liquid chromatography column packed with MIP-SG showed higher column efficiency and better resolution for the enantiomers, Boc-L-tryptophan and Boc-D-tryptophan, relative to a column packed with the conventionally prepared MIP. When Boc-L-Trp was used as the template molecule during MIP-SG synthesis, the column packed with the resulting polymer retained the Boc-L-Trp to longer elution time than the Boc-D-Trp. This order of elution was switched when Boc-D-Trp was used as template.									53	6	0	13	0	57			0888-5885			WOS:000245041400032

J	Guo, Yanping; Rockstraw, David A.				Rockstraw, David/B-9916-2013				Activated carbons prepared from rice hull by one-step phosphoric acid activation								MICROPOROUS AND MESOPOROUS MATERIALS				100	1-3			12	19		10.1016/j.micromeso.2006.10.006			MAR 23 2007	2007	Activated carbons were prepared from rice hull by one-step phosphoric acid activation in this work. The evolution of pore structure and surface chemistry in the activation temperature range of 170-450 degrees C was investigated through various characterization techniques. The results showed that the development of porosity (extent of activation) was negligible at activation temperature below 300 degrees C, and rapid evolution occurred in 300-400 degrees C. Porous activated carbon with bimodel pore structure (pore < 1 nm and pore > 1 nm) and BET surface area as high as 1295 m(2)/g was obtained at 450 degrees C. The ash contents of samples prepared in this study were in the range of 5-21 %. The ash contents of carbons prepared in this study initially decreased from 21.03% to 4.89% with the change of temperature from 170 to 300 degrees C, then increased to 8.72% at 450 degrees C. Boehm titration results suggested that low activation temperature (<= 300 degrees C) benefits the formation of acidic surface groups. With the increase of activation temperature from 300 to 350 degrees C, the concentrations of strong, intermediate and weak acidic surface groups decreased from 2.23, 1.87, and 2.73 to 1.66, 1.32, and 2.16 mmol H+/g, respectively. Over 350 degrees C, the change of these groups were insignificant. FTIR results revealed the existence of carbonyt-containing, phosphorus-containing groups, and groups containing Si-O bond. The relative concentration of carbonyl-containing groups decreases with an increase in activation temperature, while that of phosphorus-containing groups follows the reverse trend. The content of Si-O decreased first, then slowly increased with the increase of activation temperature. Boehm titration and FTIR (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) results indicated that the surfaces of these carbons contain both temperature-sensitive and temperature-insensitive groups. The temperature-sensitive part consists mainly of carbonyl-containing groups, such as carboxylic groups, while the temperature-in sensitive part is primarily phosphorus-containing groups and groups containing Si-O bond. This study demonstrated that carbon products with relative low ash content and high activation degree can be prepared from rice hull by H3PO4 activation at suitable temperature.

Expectations are that the properties of these nano-onions will be unique and potentially useful, as has been the case with the fullerenes and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). CNOs show diminished chemical reactivity; however, the established thermal diradical formation and reactivity of bis-o-diynyl arene (BODA) monomers afforded direct functionalization, solution processing, and de-functionalization of CNOs; and the first example of a radical addition of a conjugated polymer to CNOs. The functionalized and soluble CNOs were characterized by TEM, GPC, TGA, Raman spectroscopy, and XPS. A CNO defunctionalization method using oxidative TGA is also presented.									33	1	0	0	0	33			0897-4756			WOS:000244854900031

Optical absorption, emission, and quantum efficiency were measured for the nanocrystals. Dopant levels of 0.5 mol % rare earth exhibited the best emission characteristics, with maximum quantum efficiencies of 95 and 51% for LaF3:Nd and CaF2:Er, respectively. The nanopowders were suspended in PFCB (6F variant) polymer-in-toluene solutions to make transparent suspensions that could be cast to make transparent nanocomposites. Scattering analysis indicates that the excellent transmission can be attributed to nanocrystals dispersed in the composite at length scales less than 100 nm.									99	3	0	4	1	102			0897-4756			WOS:000244854900045

Specifically, the beam is considered to vibrate in all the three directions, while subjected to a base rotational motion around its longitudinal direction. This is a common configuration utilized in many vibrating beam gyroscopes and well drilling systems. The governing equations are derived by using the Extended Hamilton's Principle with a general 6-dof base motion. The natural frequency equation is then extracted in a closed-form for the case where the beam support undergoes longitudinal rotation. The effect of substrate motions on the performance of microgyroscopes is also discussed, along with the effects of a beam-distributed mass, a tip mass, angular accelerations, centripetal accelerations and Coriolis accelerations. The response of the system to different inputs is studied and the response sensitivity to input parameter variations is examined. Finally, the sources of error in the measurement of input rotational speed are investigated and identified. The results of the study demonstrate the importance of errors, caused by cross axes inputs, on the gyroscope output measurements. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Four iron-containing metalloproteins (transferrin, myoglobin, hemoglobin, and cytochrome c) were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and determined through particle beam/hollow cathode-optical emission spectroscopy (PB/HC-OES) by the Fe (I) 371.9 nm optical emission. Parametric optimization of sample introduction, nebulization, and hollow cathode source conditions is performed for the suite of Fe-metalloproteins. Response curves for the Fe (I) emission were obtained under optimized conditions with detection limits for triplicate injections occurring on the nanogram level for iron (similar to 24 ng) with variability of < 7% RSD over the concentration range of 0.1-100 mu g/mL iron in the metalloproteins. Response curves for S (I) emission yielded similar analytical characteristics. Optical emission detection of the liquid chromatography separations of the iron-containing metalloproteins demonstrates the feasibility of the PB/HC-OES system as a simple element-specific detector for liquid chromatography. The retention times of the four analytes are similar to those determined by UV absorbance (216 nm), demonstrating the ability of the PB interface to preserve the chromatographic integrity of the separation. Additionally, empirical formula calculations based on Fe (I) and S (I) emission response ratios provide a much higher level of specificity than single-element protein determination.									12	0	0	9	0	12			0003-2700			WOS:000244867100027	17298030

Thirty Erman's birch trees from six stands were sampled at an elevation of about 1950 m a.s.l. Correlation and response function coefficients indicated that radial growth of Erman's birch was positively influenced by previous August, October and current February temperature, and previous winter, and current March, June and September precipitation. In addition, radial growth showed a negative relationship to previous August and current June sunshine ratio. Precipitation and temperatures in annualization periods also positively affected the radial growth of Erman's birch. Regression analyses indicated that precipitation explained more variation in radial growth than minimum temperature. Together, these results suggested that climate affected radial growth of Erman's birch through altering soil water availability. Therefore, the radial growth of Erman's birch at the tree line in Changbai Mountain could not be predicted by temperature alone even under a scenario of global warming. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Single-source evaporation from bulk (1-x) As(0.40)Se(0.35)Te(0.25)+x Cu glasses with x=0.05, 0.075, 0.10, 0.125, and 0.15, as well as dual-source coevaporation from As-chalcogenide and Cu-chalcogenide binary glasses as source materials, has been explored. We have shown that it is not possible to deposit high concentration Cu doped ChG glassy films, from the Cu doped bulk samples using single-source evaporation. However, using the dual-source coevaporation technique, we have demonstrated that the films can be doped with high concentrations of Cu. Micro-Raman spectroscopy has been utilized to verify that Cu is introduced into the glass network without disrupting the basic As-chalcogen units. Optical measurements have shown that introduction of Cu decreases the band gap of As-Se-Te glasses. The electrical properties of the investigated films have been measured at different temperatures and it has been shown that Cu incorporation in the As-Se-Te glass system vastly improves electrical conductivity. Moreover, we have shown that the temperature dependence of electrical conductivity can be fitted assuming variable range hopping between states near the Fermi level.

Two catalysts with organic quaternary ammonium functionality (QN(+)OH(-)), a resin (A26), and a functionalized silica gel (QN(+)OH/SiO2), were used for the transesterification of triacetin with methanol (a model reaction), and their performance was studied in detail. Reactions were carried out in a well-mixed isothermal batch reactor at 60 degrees C. Both solid bases showed appreciable catalytic activity for the transesterification of triacetin conforming to the base strength of the active centers. Although the polymeric organic catalyst showed lower site activity, it was more stable during multiple reaction cycles (i.e., showed less deactivation) than the silica-supported catalyst and exhibited a higher total selectivity for glycerol for a given triacetin conversion. The effect of the support on the Bronsted base catalyzed transesterification is discussed, as is probable routes for silica-supported catalyst deactivation. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, an approach that combines the knowledge-based, clustered partitioning technique with the Hasofer-Lind reliability method is developed for estimating the annual liquefaction probability. Because it is generally difficult to validate the computed annual liquefaction probability, the results obtained from a modified version of the Davis and Berrill's energy dissipation model are used as a reference. The two models are examined with borehole data in the Yaanlin, Taiwan area that were investigated shortly after the 1999 Chi-Chi Earthquake. Results of the analysis reveal that annual probabilities of liquefaction estimated by the two models are consistent with each other and both deemed reasonable. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS				71	1			72	95		10.1016/j.jinteco.2006.02.005			MAR 8 2007	2007	For over 40 years, the gravity equation has been a workhorse for cross-country empirical analyses of international trade flows and -in particular- the effects of free trade agreements (FTAs) on trade flows. However, the gravity equation is subject to the same econometric critique as earlier cross-industry studies of U.S. tariff and nontariff barriers and U.S. multilateral imports: trade policy is not an exogenous variable. We address econometrically the endogeneity of FTAs. Although instrumental-variable and control-function approaches do not adjust for endogeneity well, a panel approach does. Accounting econometrically for the FTA variable's endogeneity yields striking empirical results: the effect of FTAs on trade flows is quintupled. We find that, on average, an FTA approximately doubles two members' bilateral trade after 10 years. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

E. Smith) larval weights and survival on replicated field-grown plant material and analyzed to determine genetic and seasonal variations of flavonoids among zoysiagrass cultivars. From multiple regression analyses and correlations, flavonoid peak 10 (luteolin-glucoside) had the greatest positive association with average fall armyworm weight; however, resistance appeared to be correlated with a number of other flavonoids.The flavonoid profiles of cultivars subjected to clustering procedures showed consistent genetic variability for five of six samplings and was used to genotype 23 cultivars. The dendrogram supported the results of the FASTCLUS procedure in clustering certain genotypes such as fall armyworm-resistant Cavalier and Zeon together, as well as J-36 and Meyer. Flavonoid evaluations measure genetic relatedness among cultivars and could be used for selective breeding of resistance to fall armyworm.									4	0	0	3	0	4			0021-8561			WOS:000244496700030	17288435

High-quality Ge23Sb7S70 glass films have been deposited onto oxide coated silicon wafers using thermal evaporation, and high-index-contrast channel waveguides have been defined using SF6 plasma etching. Microfluidic channel patterning in photocurable resin (SU8) and channel sealing by a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) cover completed the device fabrication. The chalcogenide waveguides yield a transmission loss of 2.3 dB/cm at 1550 nm. We show in this letter that using this device, N-methylaniline can be detected using its well-defined absorption fingerprint of the N-H bond near 1496 nm. Our measurements indicate linear response of the sensor to varying N-methylaniline concentrations. From our experiments, a sensitivity of this sensor down to a N-methylaniline concentration 0.7 vol. % is expected. Given the low-cost fabrication process used, and robust device configuration, our integration scheme provides a promising device platform for chemical sensing applications.

Argon scattering from Ru(0001): Calculations and comparison with experiment								PHYSICAL REVIEW B				75	11					113408	10.1103/PhysRevB.75.113408			MAR 2007	2007	Recently reported measurements of Ar atom scattering from Ru(0001) at thermal and hyperthermal energies exhibited a number of characteristics that are unusual in comparison with other systems for which molecular beam experiments have been carried out under similar conditions: the measured energy losses are unusually small, some of the angular distributions exhibited an anomalous shoulder feature in addition to a broad peak near specular, and quantum mechanical diffraction was observed under conditions for which it was not expected. The data are analyzed and compared to calculations with classical scattering theory. Many of the unusual features observed in the measurements are explained but only upon using an effective surface mass of 2.3 Ru atomic masses, which implies collective effects in the Ru crystal. The bigger effective mass leads to substantially larger Debye-Waller factors and explains and confirms the observations of diffraction features. It also leads to the interesting conclusion that Ru is a metal for which molecular beam scattering measurements in the purely quantum mechanical regime can be performed with a range of atomic and molecular projectiles with masses substantially heavier than He.									17	0	0	0	0	17			1098-0121			WOS:000245329600025

Production and selected properties of electrospun poly(ethylene terephthalate) nanofibers								AATCC REVIEW				7	3			40	45					MAR 2007	2007	The preparation and properties of electrospun poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) nanofibers (nPET)-unmodified, functionalized, or incorporated with polymeric additives-is described. PET was chemically modified using ethylenediamine prior to electrospinning. Polymeric additives such as cellulose acetate, polyethylene glycol (PEG), or polyethylene oxide (PEO) were incorporated into the PET spinning solutions to form nPET composites. Breaking load, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and dyeing studies were performed. These materials have potential uses in topical and/or implantable medical devices.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1532-8813			WOS:000247018800005

Use of transmission-scheduling protocols, however, can be very inefficient in mobile environments due to the difficulty in adapting transmission schedules. The paper defines a new adaptive and distributed protocol that permits a terminal to adapt transmission assignments to changes in topology using information it collects from its local neighborhood only. Because global coordination among all the terminals is not required and changes to transmission assignments are distributed to nearby terminals only, the protocol can adapt quickly to changes in the network connectivity. The two key parameters that affect the ability of the protocol to adapt to changes in connectivity are the rate of connectivity changes and the number of terminals near the connectivity changes. Using simulation, we determine the ranges for these parameters for which our adaptive protocol can maintain collision-free schedules with all acceptable level of overhead. The stability of the protocol is also characterized by showing that the protocol can quickly return to a collision-free transmission schedule after a period of very rapid changes in connectivity. Our channel-access protocol does not require a contention-based random-access phase to adapt the transmission schedules, and thus its ability to adapt quickly does not deteriorate with all increase in the traffic load.

Cotton roots, earthworms, and infiltration characteristics in sod-peanut-cotton cropping systems								AGRONOMY JOURNAL				99	2			390	398		10.2134/agronj2005.0330			MAR-APR 2007	2007	Diverse cropping systems offer many advantages to farmers. We evaluated root growth, soil water infiltration, and earthworm population densities in a conventional peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.)/cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) rotation using conservation tillage (CT), and a peanut/cotton/bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum Fluegge) farming system. The rotations were initiated in 2000 in Quincy, FL, and in 2001 in Headland, AL, in both cases on a Dothan sandy loam (fine, loamy siliceous, thermic Plinthic Kandiudults). In 2003, a year with more uniform rainfall, cotton in the sod-based rotation had larger average crown root diameter per plant (22.6 vs. 16.3 mm), root area (87.2 vs. 57.4 cm(2)), root length (640 vs. 460 cm), and root biomass (18.59 vs. 10.45 g) as compared with cotton in the peanut/cotton rotation. Water infiltration rates were higher in both cotton and peanut after bahiagrass compared with the conventional peanut/cotton rotation in 2003. Earthworm population densities were greater in the sod rotation compared with the traditional peanut/cotton cropping system. Water infiltration was positively correlated to earthworm population densities. Despite the improvements in soil quality, cotton yield in the sod rotation was the same as the traditional cropping systems. Cotton developed excessive vegetative growth in the bahiagrass system at the expense of lint yield. Further research is needed to determine the N rate for the sod-based rotation in comparison with the conventional cotton/peanut rotation.									16	0	0	12	2	18			0002-1962			WOS:000245290000009

Whereas this migration of cells does not provide progenitors for the myocardial cells of the conduction system, the question of whether neural crest affects the differentiation and/or function of cardiac specialized tissues continues to be of interest. Using optical mapping of voltage-sensitive dye, we determined that ventricles from chick embryos in which the cardiac neural crest had been laser ablated did not progress to apex-to-base activation by the expected stage [i.e., Hamburger and Hamilton (HH) 35] but instead maintained basal breakthroughs of epicardial activation consistent with immature function of the conduction system. In direct studies of activation, waves of depolarization originating from the His bundle were found to be uncommon in control hearts from HH34 and HH35 embryos. However, activations propagating from septal base, at or near the His bundle, occurred frequently in hearts from HH34 and HH35 neural crest-ablated embryos. Consistent with His bundle cells maintaining electrical connections with adjacent working myocytes, histological analyses of hearts from neural crest-ablated embryos revealed His bundles that had not differentiated a lamellar organization or undergone a process of compaction and separation from surrounding myocardium observed in controls. Furthermore, measurements on histological sections from optically mapped hearts indicated that, whereas His bundle diameter in control embryos thinned by almost one-half between HH30 and HH34, the His bundle in ablated embryos underwent no such compaction in diameter, maintaining a thickness at HH30, HH32, and HH34 similar to that observed in HH30 controls. We conclude that the cardiac neural crest is required in a novel function involving lamellar compaction and electrical isolation of the basally located His bundle from surrounding myocardium.									24	0	0	22	0	25			0363-6135			WOS:000244679300010	17172273

Assessing subjective sleepiness during a night of sleep deprivation: Examinining the internal state and behavioral dimensions of sleepiness								BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE				33	1			17	26		10.3200/BMED.33.1.17-28			SPR 2007	2007	Investigators in previous research have indicated that subjective measures of sleepiness may separate into state- and behavior-based dimensions; however researchers have not examined this under sleep deprivation conditions. The authors' purpose in this study was to examine several measures of subjective sleepiness under sleep deprivation conditions following completion of various tasks. Fourteen students participated in a 28-hour sleep deprivation study and completed vigilance and cognitive tasks 4 times during the night. The authors administered subjective measures of sleepiness after each task. Factor analyses indicated that when individuals were not excessively sleepy, subjective sleepiness measures separated into 2 dimensions: state and behavioral sleepiness. However, when individuals were more fatigued, there was no distinction between the state and behavior dimensions of sleepiness. The current results suggest that using measures that assess state and behavioral sleepiness separately could be useful in clinical and research settings when extreme levels of sleepiness are not expected.									8	0	0	7	0	8			0896-4289			WOS:000246605600003	17517542

Influence of brick air scrubber by-product on growth and development of corn and hybrid poplar								BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY				98	5			1085	1094		10.1016/j.biortech.2006.04.013			MAR 2007	2007	Studies were conducted to determine the effects of spent reagent from air pollution control scrubbers used at a brick manufacturing facility on emergence, growth, and physiological responses of corn and hybrid poplar plants. Scrubber by-product was obtained from General Shale Brick, Louisville, KY. Potting substrate was weighed and quantities of scrubber by-product were added to the substrate to obtain treatments of 0%, 6.25%, 12.5%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% scrubber by-product (w:w) for the corn study. Each treatment mix was potted into nine replicate polyethylene pots and four corn seeds were sown per pot. The pots were randomized in a greenhouse at Clemson University and the number of seedlings emerging from each treatment, dark-adapted leaf chlorophyll a fluorescence, and shoot heights were measured at the end of a 21-day growth period. Then, dry shoot biomass was determined for plants from each treatment and plant tissues were analyzed for selected constituents. For the poplar study, nine-inch cuttings of hybrid poplar clone 15-29 (Populus trichocarpa x P. deltoides) and clone OP367 (P. deltoides x P. nigra) were planted in treatments of scrubber by-product-potting soil mixes of 0%, 5%, 101/o, and 25% w:w. Leaf chlorophyll a fluorescence was measured over six weeks and cumulative leaf area, dry biomass, and nutrient content of tissues were determined upon harvest. Results of these studies indicate that percent seedling emergence for corn plants decreased with increasing scrubber by-product application rates. Application rates up to 12.5% scrubber by-product w:w had no adverse effect on corn seedling emergence. Shoot elongation, biomass production, and the status of the photosynthetic apparatus of the seedlings were also not severely impaired at applications below this level. A critical value of 58.2% w:w scrubber by-product was estimated to cause 25% inhibition of seedling emergence. Biomass production, cumulative leaf area, and chlorophyll a fluorescence of hybrid poplar plants were not affected by scrubber by-product applications of up to 5% w:w. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

An electric analogy is used to capture the flow of information throughout the design process, it maps well to existing models of collaboration, and it provides a mechanism to capture resistances to flow. Specifically, the resistances are identified from a collaborative design taxonomy. Currently, these resistances are qualitatively captured based upon empirical evidence, but they may in the future be calibrated with additional experimental investigations. The model is illustrated through a simple example. Extensions and an assessment of the model are provided.									5	1	0	0	0	6			1063-293X			WOS:000247566300003		
J	Zhang, Yanhua								Negotiating a path to efficacy at a clinic of traditional Chinese medicine								CULTURE MEDICINE AND PSYCHIATRY				31	1			73	100		10.1007/s11013-006-9039-6			MAR 2007	2007	Chinese medicine emphasizes the underlying connection of the bodily, emotional, social, and environmental dimensions in illness experience and healing. The therapeutic process, characterized as tiao (attuning, balancing), targets the patient's overall illness condition and experience including both physical and nonphysical aspects of suffering. This study, incorporating techniques of microanalysis as an ethnographic tool and using an actual recorded clinical interaction as data, analyzes how the path to effective healing is negotiated among multiple clinical realities at a clinic of Chinese medicine in Beijing. A close examination of interactive features of actual face-to-face communication between a doctor and a patient in a specific case of "stagnation of emotions" reveals that, for an illness recognized in Chinese medicine as originating from disordered emotions, adjustment of the patient's perceptions of reality and social relations is particularly salient in the "attuning" process. Efficacy then should be understood as more than physiological changes produced by herbs, but also as emergent through an interactive event of clinical encounters. This study demonstrates empirically how the clinical process of Chinese medicine works to define and transform the patient's emotions and experience.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0165-005X			WOS:000244452900004	17273941

NMR and X-ray studies revealed that in these states the overall structure of calmodulin adopts various conformations referred as: disordered semi-compact, extended and compact conformations, respectively. In addition, a new X-ray structure was recently reported (Structure, 2003, 11, 1303) showing that calcium-loaded, peptide-free calmodulin can also adopt a compact conformation in addition to the well known extended conformation. The calculated energy changes of calcium-loaded, peptide-free calmodulin along the pathway connecting these two conformations provide a possible explanation for this structural plasticity. The effect of pH and organic compounds in the solution phase on the preference of calmodulin to adopt compact or extended conformations may be thus rationalized. Analysis of the contribution of the ionization changes to the energy of association of calmodulin lobes suggested that the formation of the compact forms requires protonation of several acidic residues. However, two different protonation scenarios are revealed: a protonation due to internal lobe organization and thus independent of the lobes association, and a protonation induced by the lobes association resulting to a proton uptake. In addition, the role of the individual residues on the energy of association of calmodulin lobes is calculated in two compact conformations (peptide-free and peptide-bound) and is shown that a set of residues always plays a dominant role in inter-domain interactions.									7	0	0	3	0	7			0175-7571			WOS:000244723300005	17285296

Boiling dryout on flat surfaces covered with bead-packed structures								HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER				43	5			405	414		10.1007/s00231-005-0067-5			MAR 2007	2007	Visual observations were conducted to focus on the dynamic interfacial behavior associated with dryout and rewetting during boiling on surfaces covered with porous structures made of staggered glass beads. Associated interfacial behavior was significantly affected by the bead-packed structure. Intensive wetting of the liquid replenishment protected heated surface from full dryout. Even at extremely high heat fluxes, intermittent rewetting of heated surface can also be established due to rather unsteady behavior of dry areas. Based on these unique characteristics, an introductory model was proposed to perform a theoretical analysis and explore the dryout process inside the pore structure. The theoretical results were compared with experimental data, and the present model provides a good explanation of the fundamental mechanisms and predicts the important influences of the bead-packed structure on dryout behavior.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0947-7411			WOS:000243804600001

Specifically, the motion of UAVs are planned in a centralized fashion. The standard navigation function approach is extended to a multiple navigation strategy with an analytical switch among different cases due to the limited sensing zone of the UAVs. A differentiable controller is proposed based on this navigation function that yields asymptotic convergence. A discussion for avoiding moving EAs is presented. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed control strategy.

J	Govindaluri, Srikrishna Madhumohan; Cho, Byung Rae								Robust design modeling with correlated quality characteristics using a multicriteria decision framework								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY				32	5-6			423	433		10.1007/s00170-005-0349-6			MAR 2007	2007	Robust design (RD) is a popular design methodology for minimizing the variability of product performance, thereby, improving the quality of a product. Although RD principles have been widely implemented in many industries, and a number of new RD models have been reported in the literature, there is ample room for improvement. First, a number of RD models consider a single quality characteristic (QC). In reality, however, the judgmental basis of a product from the perspective of the customer is characterized by the assessment of multiple QCs, which are often correlated. Second, previous models often fail to emphasize customer preferences in the modeling and optimization phases. To rectify these shortcomings, this paper proposes a compromise programming model for synthesizing Pareto solutions that represent compromised trade-offs between multiple correlated QCs based on the customer's preferences. The Tchebycheff-metric-based compromise programming method employed to determine Pareto solutions is superior to the simplistic weighted sum and goal programming approaches that may fail to explore the full set of Pareto points for a multi-objective optimization problem.									25	1	0	0	0	26			0268-3768			WOS:000244691400001

Well-known weighting methods, such as the fuzzy entropy method, often use linguistic qualifiers to better capture customers' perceptions of a product's ability to satisfy their needs by converting the linguistic ratings to numerical values using fuzzy theory and simulation. Although the entropy method is often identified as one of the most efficient tools, it fails to capture the dependencies between successive evaluations of linguistic ratings. This is particularly crucial when customers make buying decisions, since their evaluation of one product often influences subsequent evaluations of other products. In this paper, a Markovian model is proposed to capture these dependencies using transitions from one linguistic evaluation to another. A case study is presented in Section 8. This is perhaps the first attempt in the literature to integrate stochastic modeling in weight assessment.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1072-4761			WOS:000246126000006

JOM				59	3			33	38		10.1007/s11837-007-0036-1			MAR 2007	2007	Nanoscience promises a future of novel devices and technologies that harness the atomic or molecular structure of matter. An intriguing manifestation of this paradigm is in the electrical properties of nonlinear carbon nanotube (CNT) morphologies, such as nanocoils/helices and branched forms, which exploit novel functionality at the nanoscale. For example, in a Y-CNT, the junction region can possess a charge due to the necessary presence of topological defects and catalyst particles. The resultant induced charge and asymmetry is analogous to "gating" that could be harnessed for electrical modulation and switching. Helical morphologies, in addition to use as electrical inductors, could be pertinent for a new type of electronic architecture wherein a coil could correspond to a sequence of junctions with alternating metallic and semiconducting character. While these alternative device concepts represent a revolutionary departure from the conventional architectures, the exact underlying mechanism of self-gated switching behavior is yet to be clearly understood.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1047-4838			WOS:000244825600010

After controlling for other risk factors (i.e., depression, self-esteem, problem drinking, impulsivity, religiosity), delinquency was still significantly related to an increased likelihood for suicidal ideation 1 and 7 years later, and to suicide attempts 1 year later. Further, delinquency was significantly related to suicidal ideation for girls more than for boys.Conclusions: These findings suggest that delinquent youth, particularly delinquent girls, should be targeted in interventions to reduce suicidal behaviors.

Our goal was to shed light on the use of IMC in practice vis-a-vis its theoretical relevance in the advertising and business literature. Using a framework by Nowak and Phelps (1994), we examined IMC utilization by service organizations and physical goods manufacturers at the tactical (advertisement) level over five time periods spanning 20 years. Results indicate that IMC is a reality among both services ads and physical goods ads, yet its incidence has not increased significantly over this time frame.

JOURNAL OF AMERICAN COLLEGE HEALTH				55	5			277	282		10.3200/JACH.55.5.277-282			MAR-APR 2007	2007	Victimization is a significant problem among college students, but it is less likely to be reported to the police than are victimizations in the general population. Objective: In this study, the authors examined (1) whether reasons for not reporting varied by type of victimization (sexual or physical) and (2) victim-, offender-, and incident-related predictors of these reasons. Participants: To address these objectives, the authors used data collected from 492 female college students. Methods: The authors recruited women via flyers placed around campus that asked them to come to the student health center to complete anonymous surveys. Results: Findings from within-subject analyses indicated that women were more likely to cite the following reasons for not reporting a sexual rather than a physical victimization: the incident would be viewed as their fault, they were ashamed, they did not want anyone to know about the incident, or they did not want the police involved. Results from logistic regression analyses indicated that the predictors of not reporting also varied across crime types. Conclusions: The authors discuss study implications for campus-based prevention strategies.									15	0	0	0	0	15			0744-8481			WOS:000245223300003	17396400

Complexity dynamics of nascent entrepreneurship								JOURNAL OF BUSINESS VENTURING				22	2			236	261		10.1016/j.jbusvent.2006.06.001			MAR 2007	2007	We use theory and methods from complexity science to examine dynamic patterns among activities undertaken by nascent entrepreneurs in the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics. We develop hypotheses predicting that certain dynamic patterns in start-up activities will lead to the emergence of new firms when: (1) the rate of start-up activities is high, (2) start-up activities are spread out over time, and (3) start-up activities are concentrated later rather than earlier over time. All three hypotheses are confirmed. The paper concludes with some suggestions for the role of complexity science for furthering insights into the process of organization creation.

J	Grabowski, T. B.; Isely, J. J.								Spatial and temporal segregation of spawning habitat by catostomids in the Savannah River, Georgia and South Carolina, USA								JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY				70	3			782	798		10.1111/j.1095-8649.2007.01341.x			MAR 2007	2007	Spawning aggregations of five species of catostomids were observed on the two mid-channel gravel bars of the Savannah River, Georgia and South Carolina, in 2004 and 2005 to assess the degree of spatial and temporal overlap in the use of this habitat and determine the habitat preferences leading to segregation. Spawning catostomids showed a considerable amount of temporal overlap in their use of these mid-channel gravel bars. The observed temporal overlap was consistent between 2004 and 2005 and corresponded to temperatures at which species were present. The distribution of catostomids was not uniform at the upstream gravel bar. Carpsuckers Carpiodes sp., spotted sucker Minytrema melanops and robust redhorse Morostoma robustum both demonstrated some spatial overlap with notchlip redhorse Moxostoma collapsum; however. their overall distributions were different from one another. Northern hogsucker Hypentelium nigricans was present across the gravel bars, apparently as an egg predator. Spawning catostomids segregated based on flow, depth, slope and substratum size. Whether due to limited habitat availability or changes in the timing of reproduction due to altered cues, temporal and spatial overlap occurs between spawning catostomids despite the apparent partitioning of available spawning habitat. It is unclear, however, if this overlap results in excessive mortality in the early life-history stages of these species. Results suggest spatial overlap among catostomid species was minimized due to species spawning in areas within a narrow range of conditions. Intraspecific interactions such as nest site superimposition or disturbance may be a concern. (c) 2007 The Authors.

J	Foulk, Jonn A.; Bunn, Joe M.								Factors influencing the duration of lag phase during in vitro biodegradation of compression-molded, acetylated biodegradable soy protein films								JOURNAL OF FOOD ENGINEERING				79	2			438	444		10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2006.01.070			MAR 2007	2007	In order to make use of and exploit commercially biodegradable protein-based materials, degradation research is essential to provide information pertinent to the basic production and handling properties of such materials. It seems that the experimental methods utilized to evaluate the lag phases of protein films may be applied to other substrates under various conditions. Techniques used to determine lag phases may provide insight into the degradation challenge of maintaining the integrity of materials during use, followed by its biodegradation upon disposal. Chemically modified agricultural materials demonstrate different lag phases prior to biodegradation with lag phases perhaps quantifying modifications. Acclimated (microorganisms which are adapted or accustomed to an environment) and unacclimated microorganisms were investigated to estimate the lag phase times for soy protein-based materials. Before full degradation developed, a lag phase was observed for the acclimated and unacclimated microorganisms with the unacclimated microorganisms requiring longer periods prior to degradation.

J	Hager, Sarah; Straka, Thomas; Irwin, Heather								What do teenagers think of environmental issues and natural resources management careers?								JOURNAL OF FORESTRY				105	2			95	98					MAR 2007	2007	High school student knowledge of and interest in natural resources issues and careers is important to the future of the forestry profession. This article reports on a high school student's research project to establish what these knowledge and interest levels are. This student used MySpace to survey high school students across the country. Interest in the environment and natural resource issues was high, but interest in natural resource careers, especially forestry, was low. One major reason for the results seems to be a lack of information concerning natural resource careers at the high school counseling level. This suggests that marketing may be needed to attract students to the forestry profession.									6	0	0	2	1	8			0022-1201			WOS:000245602900009		
J	Grover, Varun; Saeed, Khawaja A.								The impact of product, market, and relationship characteristics on interorganizational system integration in manufacturer-supplier dyads								JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS				23	4			185	216		10.2753/MIS0742-1222230409			SPR 2007	2007	Firms are increasingly using collaborative systems to enhance supply-chain visibility. A key emphasis of these interorganizational systems (IOS) is to improve the coordination between buyers and suppliers through electronic integration. While such IOS integration is purportedly good, because it tightens linkages in the supply chain, it is not clear whether it is the best configuration under all conditions. A review of literature on adoption and use of electronic data interchange (EDI) systems (a type of IOS) shows that this issue has been examined from multiple theoretic perspectives. Researchers have examined how contingencies related to technology, organization, and environment shape EDI use. Limited attention has been directed toward understanding how conditions under which transactions are conducted impact the use of IOS. We argue that transactional characteristics are important antecedents to IOS integration and propose that demand uncertainty, complexity, market fragmentation, and market volatility capture key characteristics. These factors coupled with an open information-sharing environment are hypothesized to influence 10S integration. Data collected from the electronics industry is used to examine the research model. Results show that firms tend to deploy integrated 10S when complexity of the component is high, market fragmentation is low, and an open information-sharing environment exists. Thus, from a managerial perspective, IOS integration is the appropriate configuration under conditions of high product complexity and open information-sharing environment, but it precludes the firm from participating in the open market and gaining brokerage benefits.									59	0	0	0	0	59			0742-1222			WOS:000246807000010		
J	God, Jason M.; Tate, Patricia; Larcom, Lyndon L.								Anticancer effects of four varieties of muscadine grape								JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL FOOD				10	1			54	59		10.1089/jmf.2006.230			MAR 2007	2007	The initiating event in carcinogenesis is a somatic mutation. During progression of the disease, additional mutations accumulate as the transformed cells develop the ability to proliferate and metastasize. These mutations can be produced by reactive oxygen species ( ROS) generated through metabolism, or environmental insult. Metastasis involves tissue degradative enzymes, many of which are members of the matrix metalloproteinase family. Hence, substances that can neutralize ROS, inhibit mutagenesis, or block activity of the matrix metalloproteinases should prove to be anticarcinogenic. This study was performed to evaluate the possible anticarcinogenic characteristics of muscadine grapes. These grow wild in the southeast United States and have not been subjected to extensive breeding, as have most commercially cultivated fruits. The extracts tested were from pomace remaining after wine production. This is usually discarded, but the results obtained in this study indicate that pomace water extracts could be used as sources for purification of anticarcinogenic compounds. Four varieties of muscadine grape were tested for their abilities to affect mutagenesis by the metabolically activated carcinogen 2-aminoanthracene. Each extract was also assayed for antioxidant activity and for its ability to inhibit activity of matrix metalloproteinases-2 and -9. Each of the four extracts showed significant inhibition of 2-aminoanthracene mutagenesis, high antioxidant activity, and the ability to inhibit activities of both metalloproteinases, implying that these extracts could be good inhibitors of carcinogenesis. Two of the extracts showed little activity when tested for their effects on mutagenesis by the direct-acting mutagen methyl methanesulfonate.									17	0	0	11	1	18			1096-620X			WOS:000246276100008	17472467

The role of fairness perceptions and accountability attributions in predicting reactions to organizational events								JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY				141	2			203	222		10.3200/JRLP.141.2.203-223			MAR 2007	2007	Researchers have found that fairness perceptions relate to many different outcomes (e.g., J. A. Colquitt, D. E. Conlon, M. J. Wesson, C. Porter, & K. Y. Ng, 2001). However, they cannot predict when an employee will react against a specific individual or against the organization itself. To address this question, the authors integrated the fairness and blame-attributions literatures. They predicted that blame attributions would strengthen the relationship between fairness perceptions and reactions to specific organizational agents. They surveyed 48 employees who believed there were inaccuracies in their most recent performance appraisals. Employees reported perceptions of fairness and attributions of blame to both their supervisor and the organization and rated their commitment to both targets. Supervisors simultaneously rated each employee's citizenship behavior toward each target. For supervisor reactions and organizational citizenship behavior directed at the organization, blame and fairness perceptions interacted; unique positive reactions were elicited only when the supervisor was perceived as blameless and fair.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0022-3980			WOS:000245820900007	17479588

Stable plume rise in a shear layer								JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION				57	3			328	331					MAR 2007	2007	Solutions are given for plume rise assuming a power-law wind speed profile in a stably stratified layer for point and finite sources with initial vertical momentum and buoyancy. For a constant wind speed, these solutions simplify to the conventional plume rise equations in a stable atmosphere. In a shear layer, the point of maximum rise occurs further downwind and is slightly lower compared with the plume rise with a constant wind speed equal to the wind speed at the top of the stack. If the predictions with shear are compared with predictions for an equivalent average wind speed over the depth of the plume, the plume rise with shear is higher than plume rise with an equivalent average wind speed.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1047-3289			WOS:000244827600010	17385599

Largely because of its status as a detached, non-governmental evaluation by eminent scientists, no studies have had a broader impact on the development of biological thinking in regard to nuclear policies. This paper demonstrates that despite the first BEAR study's reputation as an objective and independent study, it was the product of careful negotiation between Academy scientists, the Atomic Energy Commission, and Britain's Medical Research Council. This paper also reveals the fragility of the consensus that produced the Academy's report, the range of political uses of the report, and the subsequent disaffection of the scientists who took part in it.									20	0	0	8	0	21			0022-5010			WOS:000244313600005	17993170

In vitro regulation of adipogenesis: tunable engineered tissues								JOURNAL OF TISSUE ENGINEERING AND REGENERATIVE MEDICINE				1	2			146	153		10.1002/term.17			MAR-APR 2007	2007	A major clinical challenge in creating a tissue-engineered medical implant is the ability to expand cells biopsied from the patient to obtain a clinically relevant cell volume. A common tissue engineering strategy involves the culture of autologous progenitor cells on biomaterials to form an implantable cellular device. However, autologous progenitor cells often lose their differentiation potential during the expansion process. The acute regulation of mammary tissue expansion in vivo through local modulation of connective tissue suggests that the parenchymal-stromal interactions are crucial to develop tissue ex vivo. To better understand cellular behaviour in co-culture in two-dimensional systems, mesenchymal stem cells were treated with mammary epithelial cell conditioned medium and assessed for cell proliferation, lipid production and morphological changes over a 17 day culture period. The results showed that bovine epithelial cells (MAC-T) are able to inhibit mouse mesenchymal stem cell differentiation (D1), even in the presence of adipogenic cocktails. The inhibitory effect is reversible, thus potentially providing a mechanism for 'tuning' a cell-based device prior to implantation. Further studies found that there were significantly higher levels of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) in the MAC-T-conditioned medium than in the murine mammary epithelial cell (NMuMG)-conditioned medium, which was not able to inhibit adipogenesis of D1 cells. D1 cells are able to proliferate and maintain their differentiation potential in MAC-T-conditioned medium. The long-term implication is that new culture media may be developed that allow the rapid, clinical expansion and differentiation or dedifferentiation of cells for regenerative medicine applications.

Cytochrome-c oxidase I sequences from tissue samples were used to characterize population structure and infer patterns of gene flow from California to Alaska. No significant genetic structure was found when estimates of Wright's F-ST (i.e., Phi(ST)) were generated among all populations sampled. Nesting populations within regions, however, indicated that the inner coast of Washington State is distinct, a result corroborating previous allozyme work. Coalescent-based estimates of gene flow indicate that although migration can be high from an evolutionary perspective, nearly half of all comparisons among populations showed no gene flow in at least one direction. From an ecological perspective, moderate migration rates (Nm < 10) among most populations provide surprisingly limited connectivity at large (similar to 1,000 km) and small (similar to 100 km) spatial scales. Coalescent-based estimates also show that gene flow between the inner and the outer coasts is asymmetric, a result consistent with prevailing surface currents. Because the expected inter-locus variances for coalescent-based estimates of gene flow are likely large, future work will benefit from analyses of nuclear DNA markers. However, limited demographic connectivity on large spatial scales may help explain why stock recovery has been uneven, with greater recovery in the northern (87% rebuilt) than in the southern (24% rebuilt) fishery region, supporting a regional management strategy. These results suggest that despite a 3-month pelagic larval stage, some areas may be effectively closed with respect to both population dynamics and fishery management issues.									18	0	0	16	0	18			0025-3162			WOS:000244454900025

These excised segments included K-islands, which contain a high proportion of transposons, insertion sequences, cryptic phage, damaged, and unknown-function genes. The resulting multiple-deletion strain, designated E coli MDS40, has a 14% (about 700 genes) smaller genome than the parent strain, E coli MG1655. The multiple-deletion and parent E coli strains were cultured in fed-batch fermenters to high cell densities on minimal medium to simulate industrial conditions for evaluating growth and recombinant protein production characteristics. Recombinant protein production and by-product levels were quantified at different controlled growth rates. These results indicate that the multiple-deletion strain's growth behavior and recombinant protein productivity closely matched the parent stain. Thus, the multiple-deletion strain E coli MDS40 provides a suitable foundation for further genomic reduction. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Using unmotivated looking through conversation analysis, we examined transcripts from video- and audiorecordings of students' discussions in a teacher-moderated classroom setting and in small groups of 3 to 4 students. Our findings indicate that novice learners were able to interpret and understand a challenging literary text (in this case, a poem) if they were in the teacher-mode rated group. In addition, our findings suggest that use of the first language was effective in encouraging interpretive talk among students in the teacher-mode rated classroom but not among students in small groups. Ultimately, these findings indicate that the nature of the teacher-moderated, yet distinctly student-centered, interaction had a clear impact on developing the interpretive mode in novice learners.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0026-7902			WOS:000244534200002

Here we report on the molecular dynamics study of the translocation of fullerene C-60 and its derivative C-60(OH)(20) across a model cell membrane (dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine or DPPC bilayer). The simulation results indicate that, although a pristine C-60 molecule can readily "jump" into the bilayer and translocate the membrane within a few milliseconds, the C-60(OH)(20) molecule can barely penetrate the bilayer. Indeed, the mean translocation time via diffusion for the C-60(OH)(20) molecule is several orders of magnitude longer than for the former. It was also determined that the two different forms of fullerenes, when adsorbed into/onto the bilayer, affected the membrane structure differently. This study offers a mechanistic explanation of that difference and for the reduced acute toxicity of functionalized fullerenes.									213	9	1	62	0	220			1530-6984			WOS:000244867400013	17316055

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) electron beam ion trap (EBIT) facility has recently incorporated tools for preparing clean, atomically flat surfaces of single crystals from gold to tungsten to silicon and for depositing and patterning thin films that range from high resistivity oxides to transition metals like cobalt and nickel. Current activities are focused on utilizing this unique capability to simultaneously address both of the objectives above by employing technologically important magnetic multi-layer systems to perform transport measurements that provide new insight into the fundamental processes that occur during HCI-surface neutralization. Specifically, we are producing Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs) critical to both magnetic devices and incorporating HCIs in the processing recipe to adjust critical electronic properties that are currently inhibiting their advancement. In return, the electrical response of the tunnel junction to the HCI processing provides a novel approach to performing ensemble measurements of HCI-surface interactions. By varying the construction of the tunnel junction, critical tests of the role of electron density, densities of states and electronic structure in the HCI-surface charge exchange can be performed.

These nanoparticle samples had very different average particle sizes and size distributions, and their suspensions were protected by different stabilization agents. However, the results show that all these variables have little effect on the optical limiting performance of the nanoparticles, suggesting that the observed limiting responses are likely dominated by a nonlinear absorption mechanism. The implication of the performance stability demonstrated by these optical limiting nanomaterials to their potential applications is discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Candida is an increasingly important nosocomial pathogen within intensive care nurseries. The purpose of this study was to determine the attributable cost of candidemia in neonates.Methods: This case-control study included all neonates with candidemia receiving care in hospitals in Connecticut and in Baltimore County and the city of Baltimore, MD. We identified 47 cases and 130 control patients. Multivariable linear regression was used to control for state, birth weight and mortality to determine the effect of candidernia on length of stay, cost per day and total hospital costs.Results: Candidemia was associated with a $28,000 increase in total hospital costs in multivariable analysis. This increase in total cost was the result of both an increase in costs per day and length of hospital stay. Other cost-increasing variables included in the analysis were: state of origin (Connecticut), survival and decreasing birth weight.Conclusions: This represents the first study of the adjusted costs of candidemia in neonates. In addition to high mortality, candidernia was associated with increased hospital costs. This cost analysis could be helpful in determining the financial benefits of preventing candidemia in high risk neonates.									36	1	0	25	0	38			0891-3668			WOS:000245089900001	17484214

The measured methane yields/D for the different species compared at the same energy/D diverge below about 60 eV D-1, the incident triatomic molecular ions leading to the largest yields/D, and the atomic ions to the smallest, reaching a factor of two difference at 10 eV/D. The measured yields/D are in reasonable agreement with molecular dynamics simulations over the entire calculated energy range. The model surfaces were prepared by D, D-2 and D-3 impacts in a way that mimics the experiment. For D-2 incident at energies below 15 eV/D, the simulations show a strong dependence of the sputtering yields on the vibrational state of the incident projectile.					11th International Workshop on Plasma-Facing Materials and Components for Fusion Applications11th International Workshop on Plasma-Facing Materials and Components for Fusion Applications	OCT 10-12, 2006OCT 10-12, 2006		Max Planck Inst Plasma Phys, Greifswald Branch, Greifswald, GERMANYMax Planck Inst Plasma Phys, Greifswald Branch, Greifswald, GERMANY	15	0	0	0	0	15			0031-8949			WOS:000246790200011

The results have been found to be in agreement with Hellwarth's model for niobium oxide (Nb2O5) concentrations below 30 mol %. Above 30 mol % Nb2O5, discrepancies with the theoretical model have been observed. It has been found that high niobium ion content induces a change of the local structure within the glass and favors the formation of three-dimensional blocks of corner-sharing NbO6 octahedra. Since similarities with crystalline structures are present, we propose that some specific collective vibrational modes could be at the origin of the extra nuclear contributions to the optical Kerr effect.									9	0	0	1	0	9			1098-0121			WOS:000245329100036		
J	Froehle, Craig M.; Roth, Aleda V.								A resource-process framework of new service development								PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT				16	2			169	188					MAR-APR 2007	2007	Motivated by the increasing attention given to the operational importance of developing new services, this paper offers a theoretical framework that integrates both process- and resource-oriented perspectives of new service development (NSD) by defining and organizing 45 practice constructs for NSD-related practices and activities that occur in contemporary service firms. We employ a rigorous procedure whereby both quantitative and qualitative data were gathered through multiple rounds of interviews and card-sorting exercises with senior service managers. This iterative refinement process helps ensure that the construct domains and definitions are consistent and that they are applicable across multiple service sectors. A primary contribution of this research is to provide precise operational definitions of theoretically important NSD practice constructs. Importantly, this study expands on the NSD literature by including both resource- and process-centric perspectives within a single framework. A second contribution is to illustrate a general methodology for developing clear, concise, and consistent construct definitions that may be generally useful for production and operations management scholars interested in new construct development for emerging areas. Empirical results suggest that the resource-process framework can help guide and organize future research on, and provide insight into, a more comprehensive view of new service development.									46	2	0	0	2	50			1059-1478			WOS:000247450200002

We first reformulate the problem using favorable variables and coordinates. This results in a quasilinear parabolic system. Energy estimates are performed, and these estimates imply that the motion is well-posed for a short time with data in a Sobolev space, as long as a condition is satisfied. This condition essentially says that the more viscous fluid must displace the less viscous fluid. It should be true that small solutions exist for all time; however, this question is not addressed in the present work.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0033-569X			WOS:000246002200011

J	Starkey, Charles								The land ethic, moral development, and ecological rationality								SOUTHERN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY				45	1			149	175					SPR 2007	2007	There has been significant debate over both the imiplications and the merit of Leopold's land ethic. I consider the two most prominent objections and a resolution to them. One of these objections is that, far from being an alternative to an "economic" or cost-benefit perspective on environmental issues, Leopold's land ethic merely broadens the range of economic considerations to be used in addressing such issues. The other objection is that the land ethic is a form of "environmental fascism" because it subordinates the welfare of humans to the good of the ecological whole. I argue that these objections are based on a fundamental misunderstanding of his theory by advocates and detractors alike. The land ethic is centrally a psychological theory of moral development and ecological rationality that advocates a shift in the way that environmental problems are conceptualized and approached.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0038-4283			WOS:000245156300008		
J	Srinivas, Arvind; Ramamurthi, Anand								Effects of gamma-irradiation on physical and biologic properties of crosslinked hyaluronan tissue engineering scaffolds								TISSUE ENGINEERING				13	3			447	459		10.1089/ten.2006.0196			MAR 2007	2007	Hydrogels containing divinyl sulfone (DVS)-crosslinked hyaluronan (HA) (hylans) are potentially useful implant biomaterials because of their non-cytotoxicity and -antigenicity. However, to successfully fulfill their intended role in vivo, their properties (e. g., mechanics, pore size, surface topography, hydrophilicity, swelling) must be modulated to match the demands of the target application. This study explored whether controlled irradiation with gamma (c) can strengthen hylans and modulate their physical and biologic properties, as has previously been shown to be possible with other natural and synthetic polymers. Hydrated hylans containing two different amounts of DVS were irradiated in vacuum to increasing doses of gamma (0-13.5 kGy). The properties of the irradiated gels were compared with those of non-irradiated controls. Changes to bulk structure were evaluated using swelling tests, surface topography and pore structure were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy, mechanics were evaluated using unconfined compression tests, and surface hydrophilicity was evaluated by measuring contact angle changes. Irradiated gels exhibited lower swelling capacity, structural weakening, increase in elasticity, surface texturing, increased pore size, and decreased surface hydrophilicity in direct correlation with received dose. Cells adhered and proliferated readily on the irradiated gel surfaces but not on control gels. The irradiated gels, however, deteriorated during long-term (< 60 days) storage. Irradiation of hylans in a lyophilized state instead resulted in gels that were more compact, swelled less, and exhibited smaller pores than their hydrated counterparts. The results show that c-irradiation, although useful to modulate hylan gel properties, presents challenges of degradation that may be associated with its generation of free-radicals, HA chain fragmentation, and disruption of DVS crosslinks, particularly when the gels are irradiated in their native hydrated state (> 98% water content). Future studies will optimize parameters for c-mediated modulation of hylan properties through irradiation under water-free conditions.									14	2	0	8	0	15			1076-3279			WOS:000245464500002	17518597

This site analysis was conducted along New Hope Road, in Pickens County, SC, to develop a sustainable landscape design for the greenway corridor to buffer future cuttings of pines and offer a variety of recreational and educational opportunities for the community. Using a "design with nature" framework, an interdisciplinary team collaborated on a thorough observation and analysis of the inherent qualities of the site, historical documents and aerial photographs to describe the land use history of the site. The dominant soil series found on the site were Cecil clay loam, Cecil sandy loam, and Pacolet clay loam. Surface soil chemistry tests were conducted to examine soil and buffer pH; organic carbon and nitrogen contents; nitrate-nitrogen; extractable phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, zinc, manganese, copper, boron, and sodium; lime requirements and recommendations; cation exchange capacity; acidity; and percent base saturation. Analysis of site history, aerial photographs, and soil testing revealed that a history of intensive agricultural land use and managed forestry on the site has noticeably altered the soil quality. Severe soil erosion and compaction brought about by a combination of anthropogenic and natural causes have left much of the site with infertile soils lacking a true topsoil layer and characterized by low pH. These qualities present numerous challenges when attempting to modify and install vegetation. Based on historical land use, soil analysis, and plant species characteristics, a final landscape design was created that addressed the environmental opportunities, constraints of the site and provided site- and plant-specific fertilizer recommendations for successful establishment and maintenance of this greenway corridor.									2	1	0	3	0	3			1083-8155			BCI:BCI200700107048

Longterm trends in nest counts of colonial seabirds in South Carolina, USA								WATERBIRDS				30	1			40	51		10.1675/1524-4695(2007)030[0040:LTINCO]2.0.CO;2			MAR 2007	2007	We analyzed temporal and spatial trends in annual nest counts of Brown Pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis), Royal Terns (Sterna maxima), and Sandwich Terns (Sterna sandvicensis) throughout South Carolina from 1969 through 2005. There was an increase in the number of active pelican nests from 1969 through the mid 1980s, although this was followed by a steady decline that continued through 2005. Numbers of Royal Tern nests have declined during the study period, especially since 1990. In contrast, annual counts of active Sandwich Tern nests remained relatively stable through the mid 1980s, then increased substantially and have since remained stable. During the early years of the study, a greater proportion of nests from each species occurred on colonies within the Cape Remain region, although this distribution appears to have shifted with a greater proportion of nests now occurring along the southern coast. At the statewide level and at each of the primary colonies, we observed a positive correlation in counts of Brown Pelican and Royal Tern nests. Mechanisms underlying the observed trends are unclear. We suggest that priorities for research include (1) determination of diet and foraging locales for all three species, (2) impacts of ectoparasites on condition and survival of pelican chicks, and (3) metapopulation structure of all three species. Management activities should focus primarily on protection of colony sites.									14	0	0	16	0	16			1524-4695			WOS:000246093100005

Role of light quality and temperature on pitted morningglory (Ipomoea lacunosa) germination with after-ripening								WEED SCIENCE				55	2			111	118		10.1614/WS-06-137.1			MAR-APR 2007	2007	Pitted morningglory seed were collected in the fall of 2003 from Blackville, SC, and 2004 from Pendleton, SC, to assess the effect of after-ripening and burial oil light and temperature requirements for germination. Pitted morningglory germination was evaluated over a 12-mo period after maturation. Germination was neither stimulated by red light or inhibited by far-red light, nor was it reversible by red or far-red light. Light was not essential for germination of buried seed. Direct exposure to Sunlight prevented germination of recently mature seed, but not once seed had sufficiently after-ripened. Pitted morningglory was capable of germination in darkness over a wide range of constant arid fluctuating temperatures immediately after maturation. Germination in response to temperature varied with time of year after maturation, with the population from Pendleton having increased germination in May. Thermal fluctuations increased germination of both populations at suboptimal temperatures. Thermal amplitude regulation of germination varied over time and appeared to play a more important role in germination of after-ripened seed than recently mature ones. The ecological significance of changes in germination requirements with after-ripening is discussed.									10	0	0	9	0	10			0043-1745			WOS:000244815100005

The paclitaxel nanoparticles were protected from agglomeration by using a known nontoxic stabilization agent. The aqueous suspended paclitaxel nanoparticles of different average particle sizes were evaluated in vitro against human breast cancer cells. The results suggest that the nanosized paclitaxel particles are effective, with an antineoplastic activity comparable to that of the commercial paclitaxel formulation. The technique should be generally applicable to the processing of nanoparticles from other important drugs with aqueous solubility problems.									13	1	0	8	0	16			0743-7463			WOS:000244248700061	17243738

Previous studies have indicated that the effective rnatrix diffusion coefficient values, obtained from a large number of field tracer tests, are enhanced in comparison with local values and may increase with test scale. In this study, we have performed numerical experiments to investigate potential mechanisms behind possible scale-dependent behavior. The focus of the experiments is on solute transport in flow paths having geometries consistent with percolation theories and characterized by multiple local flow loops formed mainly by small-scale fractures. The water velocity distribution through a flow path was determined using discrete fracture network flow simulations, and solute transport was calculated using a previously derived impulse-response function and a particle-tracking scheme. Values for effective (or up-scaled) transport parameters were obtained by matching breakthrough curves from numerical experiments with an analytical solution for solute transport along a single fracture. Results indicate that a combination of local flow loops and the associated matrix diffusion process, together with scaling properties in flow path geometry, seems to be an important mechanism causing the observed scale dependence of the effective rnatrix diffusion coefficient (at a range of scales).

However, for any specific Hox protein or tissue, very few direct in vivo-regulated target genes have been identified. Here, we have identified target genes of the Hex protein Ultrabithorax (UBX), which modifies the genetic regulatory network of the wing to generate the haltere, a modified hindwing. We used whole-genome microarrays and custom arrays including all predicted transcription factors and signaling molecules in the Drosophila melanogaster genome to identify differentially expressed genes in wing and haltere imaginal discs. To elucidate the regulation of selected genes in more detail, we isolated cis-regulatory elements (CREs) for genes that were specifically expressed in either the wing disc or haltere disc. We demonstrate that UBX binds directly to sites in one element, and these sites are critical for activation in the haltere disc. These results indicate that haltere and metathoracic segment morphology is not achieved merely by turning off the wing and mesothoracic development programs, but rather specific genes must also be activated to form these structures. The evolution of haltere morphology involved changes in UBX-regulated target genes, both positive and negative, throughout the wing genetic regulatory network. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Theoretical determination of lasing resonances in a microring								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS				101	4					043102	10.1063/1.2511634			FEB 15 2007	2007	We present a theoretical development for the lasing frequencies of a microring laser. Such a microring is typically made from an optically active polymer, which is fabricated on a metallic wire or glass optical fiber in order to provide a substrate of well-defined geometry. Lasing resonances of the microring are computed as zeros of characteristic equations, which can be arranged such that a whispering gallery term appears explicitly together with a residual term associated with waveguide modes. It is found that the residual term recedes as the thickness of the microring increases, leaving a characteristic equation associated with a pure whispering gallery mode (WGM). The resonant condition is examined to compute the lasing frequencies and the thickness of the microring that supports WGM. Computed data are compared with published experimental data on polymer microring lasers, and computed results match well with experiments.									8	3	0	0	0	9			0021-8979			WOS:000244530800002

Poly(phthalazinone ether ketone) (PPEK) copolymers containing phthalazinone and bisphenol-A (BPA) moieties were synthesized through nucleophilic substitution polycondensation. The PPEK copolymers exhibited high glass transition temperatures, excellent thermooxidative properties, good mechanical properties and improved solubility, all of which can be tailored by changing the molar ratio of phthalazinone to bisphenol monomers. The rheological investigation indicated that the incorporation of the flexible BPA moiety into the main chain lowered the melt viscosity of the copolymers. To improve the melt processability further, polymer blends of a PPEK copolymer/polycarbonate (PC) were prepared. The results suggested that blending is an effective approach for improving the melt processability of phthalazinone-containing PAEs.

Arthur				Moran, Amy/F-7072-2011				Oxygen in egg masses: interactive effects of temperature, age, and egg-mass morphology on oxygen supply to embryos								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY				210	4			722	731		10.1242/jeb.02702			FEB 15 2007	2007	Embryos of many marine invertebrates are encased in gelatinous masses for part or all of development. Because gel and intervening embryos retard oxygen flux, such a life-history mode profoundly affects partial pressures of metabolic gases surrounding embryos. However, little is known about relationships between egg-mass structure and the opportunities and constraints imposed on structure by metabolic gas transport. We examined the effects of four factors (temperature, embryo age, embryo density and egg-mass size) on the metabolism of egg masses using both natural egg masses of a nudibranch and artificial egg masses made from sand dollar embryos and low-melting point agarose. Both temperature and embryo age strongly affected metabolic rates of nudibranch embryos. For embryos of a given age (stage), rates of oxygen consumption roughly doubled between 12 and 21 degrees C; from early cleavage to the veliger stage, consumption rose two- to fourfold, depending on temperature. Oxygen profiles in egg masses showed that advanced embryonic age, and to a lesser extent high temperature, both led to steeper oxygen gradients into egg masses. Egg masses containing advanced embryos at 21 C had very low central oxygen levels. Small-diameter artificial masses (2 mm diameter) had virtually no internal oxygen gradients regardless of embryo density or temperature, while medium (4 mm) and large diameter (10 mm) artificial masses had oxygen profiles that depended strongly and interactively on embryo density and temperature. Together, our data on natural and artificial egg masses suggest that (i) multiple factors have strong effects on metabolic rate; (ii) rates of oxygen transport are relatively invariant with temperature in simple, artificial systems but may vary more strongly with temperature in natural egg masses; and (iii) the four factors - temperature, embryo age, embryo density and egg-mass size - interact in important ways bearing on egg mass design.A simple mathematical model is developed to provide a quantitative means of estimating primary and interactive effects of the different factors. We also show that in T. diomedea the gel itself is the main barrier to oxygen transport into egg masses, and that the metabolic activity of embryos increases substantially when embryos are artificially released from the capsules that contain them within the gel mass.									29	0	0	30	0	31			0022-0949			WOS:000244632700022	17267657

Three different fluids, a Newtonian reference fluid, a constant (shear) viscosity Boger fluid, and a shear-thinning elastic fluid, are used to determine the effects of both elasticity and shear-thinning on the flow field. All three fluids have similar zero shear viscosities. The Weissenberg number is manipulated by varying the diameter and the composition of the ball. Significant differences are found for the different types of fluid, demonstrating both the influence of elasticity and shear-thinning on the velocity fields. In addition, the impact of the wall on the flow field is qualitatively different for each fluid. We find that the flow behind the sphere is strongly dependent on the fluid properties as well as the elasticity. Also, the presence of a negative wake is found for the shear-thinning fluid at high Weissenberg number (Wi > 1). (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Layers of poly(itaconic acid), poly(methacrylic acid), and sodium poly(styrene sulfonate) were grown by SC-ATRP from self-assembled initiator monolayers of [BrC(CH3)(2)COO(CH2)(11)S](2) on gold substrates. The polymer layers were characterized with variable-angle ellipsometry and external-reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Without intervention, atom transfer radical polymerization catalysts were deactivated by complexation with the deprotonated acidic monomers, disproportionation, and dissociation during the polymerization of these monomers in water; the result was the cessation of polymer growth. The addition of an alkali salt to the reaction media suppressed catalyst deactivation, allowing polymer layers to increase in thickness linearly for longer periods of time with respect to salt-free conditions. This result suggested an improved degree of polymerization control. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.									27	2	0	0	0	29			0887-624X			WOS:000244013000002

The number average molecular weight of the polymer, determined by membrane osmometry, was found to be approximately 64,000 and the theta temperature 57.7 degrees C at the reported conditions. Various synthesis conditions and different temperatures were applied for preparation of polyaniline and the number average molecular weights of the polymer were determined. The molecular weight results obtained by membrane osmometry were compared with the molecular weight results obtained by gel permeation chromatography. Both methods showed that the molecular weight strongly depended upon the synthesis conditions. The polymers obtained were characterized by various spectroscopic techniques. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

An alkyl alkoxysilane encapsulation agent is included during the nanoparticle formation process, forming a nanoparticle encapsulation layer that inhibits aggregation as evidenced by UV-vis spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. In addition, the encapsulated nanoparticles exhibit a small size (10 nm), intense luminescence, and excellent photostability. We estimate that the molar extinction coefficients of the similar to 10 nm particles are approximately 5.0 x 10(7) M-1 cm(-1) with a luminescence quantum yield of 6%, indicating a luminescence brightness many times larger than that of conventional fluorescent dyes and comparable to that of colloidal semiconductor quantum dots. The small size, high brightness, highly red-shifted luminescence, and long luminescence lifetimes of the nanoparticles are of interest for luminescence labeling and sensing applications.									44	2	0	2	0	46			0743-7463			WOS:000243990200001	17279632

Chu, Yen-Hsyang/F-5530-2011; Larsen, Miguel/A-1079-2013				First measurements of neutral wind and turbulence in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere over Taiwan with a chemical release experiment								JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS				112	A2					A02301	10.1029/2005JA011560			FEB 8 2007	2007	[1] Neutral winds and turbulence structure in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere were measured with a sounding rocket chemical release experiment carried out in Taiwan. Trimethyl aluminum (TMA) was used as a tracer of the drift of the background atmosphere. The results show that the measured neutral wind had a maximum speed of 154 m/s at a height around 105 km. The wind vectors were found to rotate clockwise with height in the altitude range from about 98 to 121 km. On the basis of the hodograph analysis of the measured neutral wind vectors, an upward propagating inertio-gravity wave with intrinsic period of 11.2 hours and vertical wavelength of 19.5 km was believed to be primarily responsible for the height variations of the neutral wind and the Richardson number. Large vertical wind shears were observed near 100 km and 106 km. Turbulent structures were observed in much of the trail below 110 km, but there were enhanced structures in the altitude range between the two large shears, i.e., at and near the altitude of the maximum wind speed. Comparing the positions of the turbulent features with expected atmospheric stability zones induced by an upward propagating gravity wave indicates that the turbulence structures were primarily located within the wave-induced convectively unstable zone. The structures are therefore interpreted as counterrotating vortices within the convective instability zone of a breaking gravity wave. Moreover, the relation between the horizontal separations lambda (about 1.8 km) of the turbulent structures and the vertical extent h (about 0.7 and 1.5 km) of the wind shear zones with Richardson numbers less than 0.25 did not conform to the predicted lambda/h ratio of a factor of approximately 8 predicted by simple linear Kelvin-Helmholtz instability theory for the primary billow structures associated with the instability. These results suggest that the observed structures were not the primary billows but were more likely associated with a secondary instability, such as the counterrotating vortices that develop later in the evolution of the instability. In general, the observations reported here support the interpretation that the turbulence evident in the trail was very likely generated in the convectively unstable zone induced by the inertio-gravity wave propagating through the region with large temperature gradients -32 K/km produced by wave breaking processes.									18	0	1	1	0	20			0148-0227			WOS:000244205300001		
J	Li, Zhigang; Wang, Xi; Chen, Feng; Kim, Hyun-Jin								Chemical changes and overexpressed genes in sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) upon methyl jasmonate treatment								JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY				55	3			706	713		10.1021/jf062481x			FEB 7 2007	2007	The effects of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) on the production of bioactive chemicals and gene expression in sweet basil were investigated. The total amount of phenolic compounds significantly increased in sweet basil after 0.5 mM MeJA treatment. Among the phenolic compounds, rosmarinic acid (RA) and caffeic acid (CA) were identified, and their amounts increased by 55 and 300%, respectively. The total amount of terpenoids also significantly increased after the same treatment. Particularly, eugenol and linalool increased by 56 and 43%, respectively. To better understand the signaling effect of MeJA on sweet basil, suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) was used to identify the MeJA up-regulated genes. Among the 576 cDNA clones screened from the forward SSH cDNA library, 28 were found to be up-regulated by the MeJA treatment. Sequencing of these cDNA clones followed by BLAST searching revealed six unique transcripts displaying high similarities to the known enzymes and peptide, that is, lipoxygenase (LOX), cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase (C4H), prephenate dehydrogenase (PDH), polyphenol oxidase (PPO), acid phosphatase (APase), and pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR), which play significant roles in the formation of secondary metabolites in sweet basil. Northern blot further confirmed the increased production at transcriptional level of LOX, C4H, PDH, PPO, PPR, and APase.									15	0	0	14	2	16			0021-8561			WOS:000243840200025	17263464	
J	The, Lih-Sin; El Eid, Mounib F.; Meyer, Bradley S.								s-process nucleosynthesis in advanced burning phases of massive stars								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL				655	2			1058	1078		10.1086/509753			FEB 1 2007	2007	We present a detailed study of s-process nucleosynthesis in massive stars of solar-like initial composition and masses 15, 20, 25, and 30 M-circle dot. We update our previous results of s-process nucleosynthesis during the core He burning of these stars and then focus on an analysis of the s-process under the physical conditions encountered during the shell carbon burning. We show that the recent compilation of the Ne-22(alpha; n)(25) Mg rate leads to a remarkable reduction of the efficiency of the s-process during core He burning. In particular, this rate leads to the lowest overproduction factor of Kr-80 found to date during core He burning in massive stars. The s-process yields resulting from shell carbon burning turn out to be very sensitive to the structural evolution of the carbon shell. This structure is influenced by the mass fraction of C-12 attained at the end of core helium burning, which in turn is mainly determined by the C-12(alpha; gamma) O-16 reaction. The still- present uncertainty in the rate for this reaction implies that the s-process in massive stars is also subject to this uncertainty. We identify some isotopes like Zn-70 and Rb-87 as the signatures of the s-process during shell carbon burning inmassive stars. In determining the relative contribution of our s-only stellar yields to the solar abundances, we find it is important to take into account the neutron exposure of shell carbon burning. When we analyze our yields with a Salpeter initial mass function, we find that massive stars contribute at least 40% to s-only nuclei with mass A <= 87. For s-only nuclei with mass A > 90, massive stars contribute on average similar to 7%, except for Gd-152, Os-187, and Hg-198, which contribute similar to 14%, similar to 13%, and similar to 11%, respectively.									76	2	0	0	0	77			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000243726000033

Surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization was used together with thiol self-assembly to generate these nanothin polymer brush layers of poly((polyethylene glycol) methacrylate). A kinetic study was done to measure the layer thickness growth rate at room temperature from flat gold substrates presenting different polymerization initiator molecule surface densities. The polymer brush layers transition from mushroom to brush regimes with increasing grafting density. A crossover density of 0.038 +/- 0.005 chains/nm(2) was determined for the PPEGMA polymer brushes. The results described in this paper show that layer properties such as wettability and dry layer thickness depend strongly on initiator surface density. Ultimately, the adsorbed concentration of an RGD-containing synthetic peptide Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser and the adhesion and spreading of cells were correlated with surface properties, which continues to be a major research theme in biomedical and biomaterials research.

J	Ibrahim, Samir; Joddar, Binata; Craps, Matthew; Ramamurthi, Anand								A surface-tethered model to assess size-specific effects of hyaluronan (HA) on endothelial cells								BIOMATERIALS				28	5			825	835		10.1016/j.biomaterials.2006.09.030			FEB 2007	2007	Crosslinked gets (hylans) containing long-chain (MW > 1 x 10(6) Da) hyaluroman (HA), a connective tissue GAG, show exceptional biocompatibility for vascular implantation but poorly interact with vascular endothelial cells (ECs). Previous studies showed in situ fragmentation of HA by UV light to bioactivate hylan gels and elicit enhanced EC responses. Since fragmented HA can be proinflammatory, it is important to define an optimal size distribution of HA fragments on the hylan surface that will recruit and support normally functional ECs and limit ulterior responses. Related studies have shown that exogenous models of HA do not necessarily replicate cell responses to HA scaffolds. Since scaffolds cannot be created based on fragmented HA alone, we sought to determine size-specific responses of ECs to HA substrates of defined fragment sizes by creation of HA-tethered culture surfaces. HA (1000, 200, 20 kDa) and an oligomer mixture were tethered onto an aminosilane (APTMS)-treated glass surfaces using a carbodiimide reaction. MALDI-TOF showed the HA digests to contain HA 4-8mers with a 75 +/- 0.4% w/w of 4mers. Immuno-fluorescence, SEM, AFM and XPS analysis revealed homogeneous amine and HA surfaces. An amine s-SDTB assay and HA fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE) indicated surface densities of 9 +/- 3 amine groups/nm(2) and 0.57 +/- 0.44 mu g/cm(2), respectively. HA/HA fragments/oligomers were stable over 21 days of incubation in serum-free culture media. EC proliferation on these surfaces resulted was limited, a possible effect of smooth surface topography, high anionicity, and in case of 4mers, non-interaction with primary HA cell-surface receptors (CD44). This work is significant in that it allows testing of cell responses to substrates composed of single-sized fragments of HA that cannot by themselves be cross-linked into a get. Future work in our lab will use this model to assess the effects of other HA oligomer sizes on EC behavior. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Athena) grown in the southeastern United States. Four combinations of chlorothalonil with or without azoxystrobin or harpin were applied weekly or according to the Melcast melon disease forecaster in field experiments in South Carolina in the autumn of 2002 and spring of 2003. Control treatments received water only or mancozeb followed by chlorothalonil. All nine fungicide treatments reduced areas under disease progress curves for downy mildew and gummy stem blight plus downy mildew compared to the water control. Chlorothalonil applied according to Melcast scheduling usually did not differ from chlorothalonil applied weekly. Azoxystrobin alternated with chlorothalonil was less effective than chlorothalonil alone when both diseases were rated together. Applications of harpin had no effect on either disease, but increased yield of fruit by 10% to 12% in one of two years compared to treatments that did not receive harpin. Growers could start the season by using Melcast scheduling to apply fungicides for gummy stem blight; these applications would also protect the crop initially from downy mildew. If downy mildew appeared during the season, the spray schedule could be switched to weekly intervals. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Crystal structures elucidated from X-ray powder diffraction data without prior indexing								CRYSTAL GROWTH & DESIGN				7	2			367	372		10.1021/cg0605943			FEB 2007	2007	OCEANA, a new genetic algorithm-based program for structure elucidation from non-indexed X-ray powder diffraction data, uses Lamarckian evolution to search for the best molecular position and orientation over a range of cell parameters for a given space group. As OCEANA does not require an indexed powder pattern, it is particularly suited for analysis of organic molecular crystals, which often crystallize in relatively large, low-symmetry unit cells. The high degree of peak overlap in the powder patterns of such compounds makes cell determination and pattern indexing very difficult and presents a major obstacle to success when using any routine that requires this information. OCEANA searches within a user-defined range of cell parameters for a specified space group and uses the experimental density to eliminate unit cells that are not viable. Several examples based on compounds with known crystal structures are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, and the crystal structure of a new compound, bis(5-quinoline)diacetylene (5QDA), is also reported.									11	0	0	1	0	11			1528-7483			WOS:000244000200035

Lake Hartwell sediments had high total PCBs (5-60 mu g/g), with significantly nonracemic EFs that generally were consistent with those from previous laboratory microcosm reductive dechlorination experiments using sediments from these sites. Thus, stereoselective reductive dechlorination had occurred in situ, including at total PCB concentrations of less than the threshold of approximately 30 to 80 mu g/g suggested as being necessary for reductive dechlorination. Enantiomer fractions of PCBs 91, 95, 132, and 136 in Lake Hartwell cores were significantly correlated both with concentrations of those individual congeners and with total PCB concentration for some sites. This result indicates that enantioselective microbial dechlorination activity increases with higher concentrations within sediments for these congeners. Enantiomer composition reversed with depth for PCBs 91, 132, and 176, suggesting that multiple microbial populations may be present within the same core that are enantioselectively dechlorinating PCBs. Such observations indicate that concentration and time are not the only factors affecting biotransformation, complicating prediction of enantioselectivity. Comparison of EFs with dates suggested biotransformation half-lives of approximately 30 years, which is on the same time scale as sequestration by burial. In contrast, Lake Ontario sediments (maximum total PCBs, 400 ng/g) had racemic or near-racemic amounts of most congeners throughout the core profile, which is consistent with achiral indicators suggesting no microbial biotransformation within Lake Ontario sediments. Thresholds for reductive dechlorination may exist, but they would be at concentrations of less than 30 to 80 mu g/g.									12	0	0	12	0	12			0730-7268			WOS:000243486000012	17713213	
J	Huntington, Julie								Rethinking rootedness in Simone Schwarz-Bart's 'Ti Jean L'horizon'								FRENCH REVIEW				80	3			594	+					FEB 2007	2007	In Simone Schwarz-Bart's Ti jean L'horizon, the novel's protagonist Ti jean embarks on an epic journey, traversing real and imaginary spaces. Indiscernibly sliding between the realms of reverie and experience, Ti jean witnesses past, present, and alternate histories through the course of his travels. As he wanders, disoriented in space and in time, the ensuing sense of confusion calls into question the concept of identity, blurring the boundaries that separate the self from the other, the past from the present, and fact from fiction. Through the negotiation of real and imaginary places and epochs, Schwarz-Bart rethinks the notions of roots and rootedness in relation to identity, particularly in considering the diasporic peoples of the Francophone Antilles, providing an alternative to Deleuze and Guattari's rhizome and Edouard Glissant's Relation models. Such motifs are apparent as Ti jean travels through disparate places and epochs, simultaneously presenting the quest for and questioning of Antillean identity.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0016-111X			WOS:000244260400005

Dwight; Khan, Ikhlas; Bharathi, Avula								Influence of rhizome propagule size on yields and triterpene glycoside concentrations of black cohosh [Actaea racemosa L. syn Cimicifuga racemosa (L.) Nuttal]								HORTSCIENCE				42	1			61	64					FEB 2007	2007	Black cohosh [Actaea racemosa L. syn. Cimicifuga racemosa (L.) Nuttal] is a native North American medicinal plant traditionally harvested for its rhizomes and roots. Black cohosh products were listed in the top 10 selling herbal supplements from 2002 to 2005. As a result of increasing commercial demand, there is a need to develop propagation protocols suitable for production purposes to replace current methods of harvesting from wild populations. The objectives of this study were to 1) determine optimal rhizome propagule division size for successful regeneration, 2) analyze triterpene glycoside concentrations, 3) quantify survival rates after 3 years of production, and 4) evaluate net yield results. Experimental sites included a shade cloth structure in an agricultural research field, a shaded forest interior, and a shaded, disturbed forest edge. Plant emergence, growth, and survival were assessed at each site over a 3-year period. Optimal rhizome division size for propagation was a 10 to 30-g section originating from terminal rhizome portions. Rhizome survival averaged 97% among all treatments tested by year 3 at three sites. No differences in mean triterpene glycoside concentrations were detected between rhizome size classes or sites tested. Mean cimiracemoside concentrations ranged from 0.80 to 1.39 mg center dot g(-1) d/w tissue, deoxyactein 0.47 to 0.92 mg center dot g(-1), and actein 10.41 to 13.69 mg center dot g(-1). No differences in triterpene levels were detected between flowering and nonflowering plants, nor were yields reduced. Net yields from a shade cloth production site were 9 and 17 times higher than a disturbed forest edge and forest site respectively. Black cohosh is a strong candidate for commercial propagation under adequate site selection.									9	0	0	6	0	9			0018-5345			WOS:000243913100012		
J	Tesche, Frederick M.								Development and use of the BLT equation in the time domain as applied to a coaxial cable								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTROMAGNETIC COMPATIBILITY				49	1			3	11		10.1109/TEMC.2007.888184			FEB 2007	2007	This paper discusses the use of the Baum-Liu-Tesche (BLT) equation for calculating transmission-line load responses directly in the time domain. From the frequency-domain BLT equation, its transient counterpart is first derived. For the special case of a coaxial cable, explicit expressions for the transient propagation function, the surge impedance and admittance, and the transient reflection coefficients at each end of the line are derived. These quantities, together with the transient-BLT equation, are used to compute the transient load voltages. The computed results are subsequently compared with transient responses obtained using the frequency-domain BLT equation and Fourier inversion, and the agreement is excellent for highly conducting cables. The benefit of deriving the BLT equation in the time domain is that it may be used, mith slight modifications, to treat the case of nonlinear or time-varying loads. This will be described in a future paper.									33	14	0	0	0	45			0018-9375			WOS:000244669100001

Using Schelkunoff's classical expressions for the transmision-line parameters of a coaxial line, the simple model is postulated and used to provide approximate responses that can be compared with the rigorous solutions. This approximate model is shown to be accurate and offers an alternative to evaluating the Bessel function expressions for the line parameters.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0018-9375			WOS:000244669100002

Antioxidant capacity of fresh and dried rhizomes from four clones of turmeric (Curcuma longa L.) grown in vitro								INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS				25	2			129	135		10.1016/j.indcrop.2006.08.004			FEB 2007	2007	Plant genotype, field conditions, and postharvest processing of turmeric (Curcuma longa L.) can alter the combinations of phytochemicals in rhizomes. We investigated the effects of drying upon the antioxidant potential of methanolic extracts from rhizomes of four clones of turmeric grown in vitro under controlled conditions. Antioxidant properties of microrhizomes were also compared with commercially available rhizome powder. The antioxidant capacities of extracts were assayed for their ability to scavenge the DPPH* radical and chelate ferrous iron. Tissue drying negatively affected the ability of extracts to scavenge the DPPH* radical in all four accessions tested, whereas the effect of tissue drying on ferrous iron chelating ability of extracts was cultivar specific. Fresh tissue extracts were more potent than extracts from commercially available turmeric powder in all cases for both assays. The iron chelation assay revealed that extracts from recently dried tissue were significantly more potent than extracts from aged commercially available turmeric powder. DPPH* scavenging capacity of the dried tissue was usually of similar intensity to the commercially available powder with only one clone showing a significant difference in potency.

Optimization for enzyme-retting of flax with pectate lyase								INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS				25	2			136	146		10.1016/j.indcrop.2006.08.003			FEB 2007	2007	Flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) is an important commercial crop that supplies both linseed and bast fibers for multiple applications. Retting, which is a microbial process, separates industrially useful bast fibers from non-fiber stem tissues. While several methods (i.e., water- and dew-retting) are used to ret flax, more recently enzymes have been evaluated to replace methods used currently. Alkaline pectate lyase (PL) from the commercial product BioPrep 3000 and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) from Mayoquest 200 as a calcium chelator were used in various formulations to ret flax stems. Retted stems were then mechanically cleaned through the USDA Flax Fiber Pilot Plant and passed through the Shirley Analyzer. The PL and chelator effectively retted flax from both fiber flax and linseed stems, and the use of enzyme plus chelator retted flax stems better than either component alone. Fiber yield and strength were greater than retting with a mixed-enzyme product that contained cellulases. Retting with PL and chelator was optimized based on fine-fiber yield, remaining shive content, and fiber properties. PL at levels of about 2% of the commercial product for I h at 55 degrees C followed by treatment with 18 mM EDTA for 23-24 h at 55 degrees C provided the best fibers based on these criteria. Yield and fiber properties determined by these tests were not improved with PL levels of 5% of the commercial product.

Ted								Machinability of ultrafine-grained copper using tungsten carbide and polycrystalline diamond tools								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE TOOLS & MANUFACTURE				47	2			286	293		10.1016/j.ijmachtools.2006.03.014			FEB 2007	2007	Equal channel angular extrusion (ECAE) is an effective process to produce bulk ultrafine-grained (UFG) materials from regular coarse-grained materials. Such ECAE-processed materials typically excel in strength, wear resistance, ductility, and high strain-rate superplasticity, with promising applications in lightweight transportation and medical industries. Precision machining work is generally indispensable for further applications after bulk materials are produced by ECAE. To effectively and efficiently machine such ECAE-processed materials for further broad applications, machining issues such as machinability and tool material selection should be considered. This study was undertaken to investigate the machinability of ECAE-processed pure copper using both tungsten carbide (WC) and polycrystalline diamond (PCD) cutting tools in order to facilitate broad applications of ECAE-processed UFG coppers. It is found that despite its higher cost, PCD is favored to machine UFG copper based on this study since it has better wear resistance, gives lower cutting forces, yields a better workpiece surface finish, and results in no smearing on the workpiece. In machining UFG copper, depth of cut notching was observed as the wear pattern and abrasion as the wear mechanism for the WC tool, while flank wear was observed as the wear pattern and diffusion as the wear mechanism for the PCD tool.

J	Peters, Kimberly A.; Otis, David L.								Shorebird roost-site selection at two temporal scales: is human disturbance a factor?								JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY				44	1			196	209		10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01248.x			FEB 2007	2007	1. Roost-site selection in shorebirds is governed by ambient factors, including environmental conditions and human disturbance. Determination of the extent to which these factors affect roost use and the associated implications for shorebird habitat protection is important for conservation strategies and informed management of human recreational use of these habitats. Shorebird conservation as a whole is a high priority world-wide because a large proportion of shorebird species is in decline. However, little is understood about the consistency of roost use by different species, what conditions affect species-specific roost-site selection, and at what spatial and temporal scales conditions influence selection.2. We studied high-tide roost-site selection by eight species of non-breeding shorebirds on a critically important stopover and wintering refuge. We calculated spatial and temporal variability in roost use for each species based on counts and consistency of incidence. We then examined roost-site selection in relation to structural, environmental and human disturbance factors, and how this varied across spatial and temporal scales.3. Most roosts were used less than 50% of the time, although larger roosts were used more consistently. This varied among species, with red knot Calidris canutus tending to concentrate at a few roosts and American oystercatcher Haematopus palliatus, dowitcher Limnodromus griseus and Limnodromus scolopaceus and ruddy turnstone Arenaria interpres more diffusely distributed among roosts.4. At an annual scale, the principal factors affecting shorebird presence at roosts were roost length (size), local region, substrate and aspect. The extent and direction of these effects varied among species. Among years, red knots avoided roosts that had high average boat activity within 1000 m, but disturbance did not appear to be a factor for other species.5. Daily roost use was influenced primarily by wind speed and the ability of roosts to provide shelter from the wind. Only dowitchers appeared to track daily disturbance, avoiding prospective roosts when boat activity within 100 m was high.6. Synthesis and applications. Our findings emphasize the need to consider species-specific differences in temporal- and spatial-scale effects of roost-site selection factors, including human disturbance, when employing conservation measures for shorebirds. We suggest that conservation management should aim to provide a wide range of potential roosts (both natural and artificial) that could be used under different wind conditions and that are within reasonable travelling distance of preferred feeding areas. Roost use is often highly variable, and monitoring efforts must take this into account before making inferences about changes in use or selection of roost sites.									16	1	0	17	1	20			0021-8901			WOS:000243023600021

Calcination was for the sole purpose of crystallization. An aqueous solution of Ca(NO3)(2)(.) 4H(2)O was rapidly added to a solution of Na2HPO4 and NaHCO3, followed by immediate removal of gel-like, poorly-crystallized precursor precipitates from the mother liquors of pH 7.4. Freeze-dried precursors were found to be nanosize with an average particle size of 45 nm and a surface area of 128 m(2)/g. Upon calcination in air, precursor powders crystallized into biphasic (60% HA-40% rhenanite) biomaterials, while retaining their submicron particle sizes and high surface areas. beta-rhenanite is a high solubility sodium calcium phosphate phase. Samples were characterized by XRD, FTIR, SEM, TEM, ICP-AES, TG, DTA, DSC, and surface area measurements.

Sterilization of bacterial spores by using supercritical carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide								JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART B-APPLIED BIOMATERIALS				80B	2			511	518		10.1002/jbm.b.30625			FEB 2007	2007	It was hypothesized that supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) treatment could serve as an alternative sterilization method at various temperatures (40-105 degrees C), CO2 pressures (200-680 atm), and treatment times (25 min to 6 h), and with or without the use of a passive additive (distilled water, dH(2)O) or an active additive (hydrogen peroxide, H2O2). While previous researchers have shown that SC-CO2 possesses antimicrobial properties, sterilization effectiveness has not been shown at sufficiently low treatment temperatures and cycle times, using resistant bacterial spores. Experiments were conducted using Geobacillus stearothermophilus and Bacillus atrophaeus spores. Spore strips were exposed to SC-CO2, in commercially available supercritical fluid extraction and reaction systems, at varying temperatures, pressures, treatment times, and with or without the use of a passive additive, such as dH(2)O, or an active additive, such as H2O2. Treatment parameters were varied from 40 to 105 degrees C, 200-680 atm, and from 25 min to 6 h. At 105 degrees C without H2O2, both spore types were completely deactivated at 300 atm in 25 min, a shorter treatment cycle than is obtained with methods in use today. On the other hand, with added H2O2 (< 100 ppm), 6 log populations of both spore types were completely deactivated using SC-CO2 in 1 h at 40 degrees C. It was concluded from the data that large populations of resistant bacterial spores can be deactivated with SC-CO2 with added H2O2 at lower temperatures and potentially shorter treatment cycles than in most sterilization methods in use today.

Based on location of discovery in each county and year, the average rate of spread from 1980 to 2005 was 23 km / yr. From 2000 to 2005, the leading edge of the infestation has moved 16.5 km / yr toward Louisiana. The 1.8-fold increase (99% confidence interval) of the area occupied from 2000 to 2005 in the Texas rice belt indicates an expansion of the distribution of E. loftini. If movement continues to occur at similar rates, E. loftini will reach Louisiana by 2008.									23	0	0	20	0	23			0022-0493			WOS:000243917200008	17370809

One component of the U.S.-wide resistance management plan for Bt cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L., involves monitoring the frequency of resistance alleles in field populations. However, existing methods are expensive and may not detect recessive resistance alleles until their frequencies are too high for countermeasures to be effective; therefore, more sensitive methods are needed. The first Bt resistance-causing mutation described at the molecular level was a retrotransposon insertion into the gene encoding a 12-cadherin-domain protein expressed in the midgut of larval Heliothis virescens (F.). We report the first large-scale screen for this mutation using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based approach on > 7,000 field-collected individuals. The specific insertion was not detected in any of these samples, nor was it detected in three progeny-tested, field-caught males thought to carry a Bt resistance gene. Unlike the targets of many chemical insecticides where a limited number of resistance-causing mutations compatible with viability can occur; a very large number of such mutations seem possible for the 12-cadherin-domain gene. However, even if these mutations are viable in the laboratory, they may not threaten the effectiveness of transgenic crops because of a high fitness cost in the field. The challenge remains to detect the subset of possible resistance-conferring alleles that are still rare but are viable in the field and increasing due to selection by Bt cotton. This situation will complicate PCR-based Bt resistance monitoring strategies.									29	2	0	30	0	34			0022-0493			WOS:000243917200026	17370827

Espresso coffee was made from freshly ground coffee beans with light-medium roast, between roast (between medium and dark) and dark French roast in order to show the influence of roasting on flavor. Samples were prepared by blending skim milk, soft-serve ice cream mix, ice and fresh espresso extracts. No significant differences (P < 0.05) were detected in total solids and fat content among treatments. Viscosity for the light-medium roasted beverage was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than the others. The beverage pH increased with increased darkening of roast. The beverage made with the light-medium roasted coffee had significantly (P < 0.05) higher preference scores for coffee flavor and overall flavor than beverages made with the between and French roasts. The between and French roasted treatments were shown to have a more intense coffee flavor by trained sensory panelists. Consumers in this study preferred a less intense coffee flavor.									3	0	0	2	0	3			0145-8892			WOS:000243404700001

A taxonomy and decision support for the design and manufacture of types of product families								JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING				18	1			31	45		10.1007/s10845-007-0002-3			FEB 2007	2007	The realization that designing products in families can and does have significant technological and economic advantages over traditional single product design has motivated increasing interest in recent years in formal design tools and methodologies for product family design. However, currently there is no guidance for designers in the first key strategic decisions of product family design, in particular determining the type of product family to design. Hence, in this paper, first a taxonomy of different types of product families is presented which consists of seven types of product families, categorized based on number of products and time of product introduction. Next a methodology is introduced to support designers in deciding which type of product family is appropriate, based upon early knowledge about the nature of the intended product(s) and their intended market(s). From this information it follows both which manufacturing paradigm and which fundamental design strategies are appropriate for each type of product family. Finally, the proposed methodology is illustrated through a case study examining a family of whitewater kayaks.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0956-5515			WOS:000248171700003

The hysteresis phenomenon is well known for its complex and multi-path behavior. To realize the underlying physics of this phenomenon and to develop an efficient compensation strategy, the intelligence properties of hysteresis with the effects of non-local memories are discussed here. Through performing a set of experiments on a piezoelectrically-driven nanostager with a high resolution capacitive position sensor, it is shown that for the precise prediction of the hysteresis path, certain memory units are required to store the previous hysteresis trajectory data. Based on the experimental observations, a constitutive memory-based mathematical modeling framework is developed and trained for the precise prediction of the hysteresis path for arbitrarily assigned input profiles. Using the inverse hysteresis model, a feedforward control strategy is then developed and implemented on the nanostager to compensate for the ever-present nonlinearity. Experimental results demonstrate that the controller remarkably eliminates the nonlinear effect, if memory units are sufficiently chosen for the inverse model.									29	0	0	0	0	29			0960-1317			WOS:000243724100021

Effect of material properties and processing conditions on RESS Of poly(L-lactide)								JOURNAL OF SUPERCRITICAL FLUIDS				40	1			134	143		10.1016/j.supflu.2006.04.003			FEB 2007	2007	Rapid-expansion experiments with CO2 + THF solutions Of poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) have demonstrated that the solid-state diffusion coefficient of the solute (D) is a key variable for controlling particle size during RES S processing. PLLA polymers with melting points (T-g) of 121 and 162 degrees C, pre-expansion temperatures (T-pre) of 70 and 100 degrees C, and THF co-solvent concentrations of 10 and 20 wt.% were all investigated for their effect on the solid-state diffusion coefficient. The weight average molecular weights of the investigated PLLAs were 1340 and 6050, well below the critical molecular weight for entanglement M-c, which is approximately 9000. An increase in T-m, a decrease in T-pre, and a decrease in THF concentration each resulted in a consistent decrease in both particle size and interparticle fusion. Because D proportional to exp(-T-m/T), where T is the particle temperature, these effects can be explained in terms of their impact on the solid-state diffusion coefficient. In general, RESS products from PLLA consisted predominantly of nanoparticles 30-100 nm in diameter, dispersed with either micron-sized particles or agglomerates of nano- and submicron-sized particles, with the type of dispersion depending on the value of D. These results suggest that the initially formed precipitates during RESS are nano-sized, and that the larger particles are subsequently obtained because of coalescence in the free jet, a process that is favored by higher values of D (and, thus T/T-m). In summary, then, our recent studies indicate that the best candidates for producing nanoscopic products by RESS are high-melting materials that can be processed at relatively low pre-expansion temperatures.

Though essentially all surfaces exhibit certain degrees of roughness, the effects of surface roughness on electroosmotic flow is not well-understood. In this paper, we investigate how the electrical double layer and electroosmotic flow are affected by molecular level surface roughness by using molecular dynamics simulations. The simulation results indicate that, when the thickness of the electrical double layer is comparable to the height of surface roughness, presence of sub-nanometer deep concave regions on a rough surface can alter the electrical double layer near the surface, and reduce the electroosmotic flow significantly.									36	2	0	4	0	38			1613-4982			WOS:000243914700005

Evidence regarding the public stigma associated with mental disorders is reviewed, indicating that the public generally holds negative stereotypes toward individuals with psychological problems, leading to potential discrimination toward these individuals. The internalization of these negative beliefs results in self-stigma, leading to reduced self-esteem and motivation to seek help. Even if soldiers form an intention to seek help for their psychological difficulty, barriers to mental health care may prevent the soldier from receiving the help they need. An overall model is proposed to illustrate how the stigma associated with psychological problems can prevent soldiers getting needed help for psychological difficulties and proposed interventions for reducing stigma in a civilian context are considered for military personnel.									122	0	0	22	0	124			0026-4075			WOS:000244232600012	17357770

These simulations were done under conditions that replicate, as closely as possible, prior experimental investigations of D-2(+) impacts on ATJ graphite. The substrate structure is heavily modified by cumulative impacts, and the sputtering yields change with increasing fluence. For the graphite sample, the surface continues to evolve up to the highest fluences studied, 3.8 x 10(20) D/m(2). For the deuterated amorphous carbon surface, however, the sample reaches a steady state at fluences of less than 1 x 10(20) D/m(2), at which point the structure and sputtering yields change slowly, aside from statistical fluctuations. The structure of this ensemble of steady-state surfaces is examined in detail, and is highly supersaturated with deuterium, with an enrichment in sp(3) carbon. The yields of the hydrocarbons sputtered from this set of surfaces show good agreement with experiment, and are significantly larger than those from the unmodified, bulk-like amorphous carbon surface, where atomic and radical species dominate. These simulations indicate that it is both feasible and necessary to perform sputtering simulations on surfaces that have been dynamically created by impacts, if meaningful comparison with experiment is desired.

The cable industry has standardized on a single medium access control (MAC) and physical layer standard, the Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS). The MAC layer of the emerging IEEE 802.16 broadband wireless access standard is also based upon DOCSIS. Thus, the performance of DOCSIS is now and will remain a critical element in the overall performance of shared medium broadband access networks. Despite this fact, public domain tools that may be used to assess and improve the performance of DOCSIS have been slow to emerge. To address this problem, we have implemented a simulation model of the DOCSIS MAC layer for the 'ns' network simulation tool. Due to the complexity of DOCSIS and because the specifications are purposely incomplete, developing an accurate simulation is quite challenging. In this paper we present analytic and live network evidence that the simulation accurately reflects the behavior of a DOCSIS network under a limited set of workloads.

J	Straka, Thomas J.; Greene, John L.								Reforestation tax incentives under the American jobs creation act of 2004								SOUTHERN JOURNAL OF APPLIED FORESTRY				31	1			23	27					FEB 2007	2007	The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 made significant changes in the reforestation tax incentives available to private forest owners. Owners can now deduct outright reforestation costs up to $10,000 per year for each qualifying timber property and amortize any additional amount over 8 tax years. To assess the financial benefit the new incentives provide to forest owners, the authors developed spreadsheets that calculate after-tax Bare Land Value (BLV) for a representative southern pine management plan under three tax situations: no reforestation incentives, the incentives under previous law, and the incentives under the current law. They found that compared to no tax incentive, the current law chiefly benefits owners with high non-timber income, increasing BLV by an amount equivalent to a reforestation cost share of roughly 25 to 30% as opposed to 5 to 15% for owners with low or median income. Compared to previous law, the current law chiefly benefits owners of large forest holdings, increasing BLV by an amount equivalent to a reforestation cost share of roughly 10 to 20%. For owners of small forest holdings, however, BLV decreased by an amount equivalent to a 5 to 10% increase in reforestation costs. These findings are significant as Congress likely intended that the new incentives continue to benefit primarly "small woodland owners" with modest incomes and forest holdings.									4	0	0	1	0	4			0148-4419			WOS:000245019600005

Atmospheric Mg2+ wet deposition within the continental United States and implications for soil inorganic carbon sequestration								TELLUS SERIES B-CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL METEOROLOGY				59	1			50	56		10.1111/j.1600-0889.2006.00242.x			FEB 2007	2007	Little is known about atmospheric magnesium ion (Mg2+) wet deposition in relation to soil inorganic carbon sequestration. Understanding the conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) or organic carbon to a form having a long residence time within the soil (e.g., dolomite, magnesian calcite) will greatly benefit agriculture, industry, and society on a global scale. This preliminary study was conducted to analyze atmospheric Mg2+ wet deposition within the continental United States (U.S.) and to rank the twelve major soil orders in terms of average annual atmospheric Mg2+ wet deposition. The total average annual Mg2+ wet deposition for each soil order was estimated with geographic information systems (GIS) using the following data layers: (1) atmospheric Mg2+ wet deposition data layers covering the continental U.S. for a 10-yr period (1994-2003) and (2) a soil order data layer derived from a national soils database. A map of average annual Mg2+ wet deposition for 1994-2003 reveals that the highest deposition (0.75-1.41 kg ha(-1)) occurred in Oregon, Washington, parts of California, and the coastal areas of East Coast states due to magnesium enrichment of atmospheric deposition from sea salt. The Midwestern region of the U.S. received about 0.25-0.75 kg ha(-1) Mg2+ wet deposition annually, which was associated with loess derived soils, occurrence of dust storms and possibly fertilization. The soil orders receiving the highest average annual atmospheric Mg2+ wet deposition from 1994 to 2003 were: (1) Mollisols (3.7 x 10(7) kg), (2) Alfisols (3.6 x 10(7) kg) and (3) Ultisols (2.8 x 10(7) kg). In terms of potential soil carbon sequestration, the average annual atmospheric Mg2+ wet deposition was equivalent to formation of the following theoretical amounts of dolomite: (1) Mollisols (2.8 x 10(8) kg of CaMg(CO3)(2)), (2) Alfisols (2.7 x 10(8) kg of CaMg(CO3)(2)) and (3) Ultisols (2.1 x 10(8) kg of CaMg(CO3)(2)). The soil orders receiving the lowest average annual atmospheric Mg2+ wet deposition were: (1) Andisols (3.3 x 10(6) kg), (2) Histosols (3.4 x 10(6) kg) and (3) Vertisols (5.0 x 10(6) kg). The methods proposed here to estimate soil inorganic carbon sequestration potential from atmospheric wet deposition data can be useful for preliminary carbon accounting on a global scale.									8	2	0	6	0	9			0280-6509			WOS:000243681100005

Changes in water storage were based on measurements of sap flow and changes in stem volume and tissue water content at different heights in the stem and branches. We measured sap flow by two variants of the heat balance method (with internal heating in stems and external heating in branches), stem volume with electronic dendrometers, and tissue water content gravimetrically. Water storage was calculated from the differences in diurnal courses of sap flow at different heights and their integration. Old-growth Douglas-fir trees contained large amounts of free water: stem sapwood was the most important storage site, followed by stem phloem, branch sapwood, branch phloem and needles. There were significant time shifts (minutes to hours) between sap flow measured at different positions within the transport system (i.e., stem base to shoot tip), suggesting a highly elastic transport system. On selected fine days between late July and early October, when daily transpiration ranged from 150 to 300 liters, the quantity of stored water used daily ranged from 25 to 55 liters, i.e., about 20% of daily total sap flow. The greatest amount of this stored water came from the lower stem; however, proportionally more water was removed from the upper parts of the tree relative to their water storage capacity. In addition to lags in sap flow from one point in the hydrolic pathway to another, the withdrawal and replacement of stored water was reflected in changes in stem volume. When point-to-point lags in sap flow (minutes to hours near the top and stem base, respectively) were considered, there was a strong linear relationship between stem volume changes and transpiration. Volume changes of the whole tree were small (equivalent to 14% of the total daily use of stored water) indicating that most stored water came from the stem and from its inelastic (sapwood) tissues. Whole tree transpiration can be maintained with stored water for about a week, but it can be maintained with stored water from the upper crown alone for no more than a few hours.									106	15	0	88	0	125			0829-318X			WOS:000244496300003	17241961	
J	Lopez, Dora E.; Goodwin, James G., Jr.; Bruce, David A.								Transesterification of triacetin with methanol on Nafion (R) acid resins								JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				245	2			381	391		10.1016/j.jcat.2006.10.027			JAN 25 2007	2007	Although homogeneous alkali catalysts (e.g., NaOH) are commonly used to produce biodiesel by transesterification of triglycerides (vegetable oils and animal fats) and methanol, solid acid catalysts, such as acidic resins, are attractive alternatives because they are easy to separate and recover from the product mixture and also show significant activity in the presence of fatty acid impurities, which are common in low-cost feedstocks. To better understand solid acid catalyst performance, a fundamental transesterification kinetic study was carried out using triacetin and methanol on Nafion (R) (perfluorinated-based ion-exchange resin) catalysts. In particular, Nation (R) SAC-13 (silica-supported Nafion) and Nation (R) NR50 (unsupported Nation) were investigated, because both show great promise for biodiesel-forming reactions. The reaction kinetics for a common homogeneous acid catalyst (H2SO4) were also determined for comparison. Liquid-phase reaction was performed at 60 degrees C using a stirred batch reactor. The swelling properties of the resin in solvents of diverse polarity that reflect solutions typically present in a biodiesel synthesis mixture were examined. The initial reaction rate was greatly affected by the extent of swelling of the resin, where, as expected, a greater effect was observed for Nafion (R) NR50 than for the highly dispersed Nafion (R) SAC-13. The reaction orders for triacetin and methanol on Nation (R) SAC-13 were 0.90 and 0.88, respectively, similar to the reaction orders determined for H2SO4 (1.02 and 1.00, respectively). The apparent activation energy for the conversion of triacetin to diacetin was 48.5 kJ/mol for Nafion (R) SAC-13, comparable to that for H2SO4 (46.1 kJ/mol). Selective poisoning of the Bronsted acid sites on Nafion (R) SAC-13 using pyridine before transesterification revealed that only one site was involved in the rate-limiting step. These results suggest that reaction catalyzed by the ion-exchange resin can be considered to follow a mechanism similar to that of the homogeneous catalyzed one, where protonated triglyceride (on the catalyst surface) reaction with methanol is the rate-limiting step.

The CAIs display correlated anomalies of (60)Ni and (62)Ni, possibly coupled with effects on (96)Zr. This is not predicted from stellar production models unless the (60)Ni results from the decay of (60)Fe. The effects show the signature of neutron-burst nucleosynthesis in a massive star. Such a neutron burst is plausibly responsible for the abundance of many of the short-lived radioactivities present in the early solar system; therefore, at least some of the nucleosynthetic heterogeneity previously reported from CAIs, leached carbonaceous chondrites, and presolar grains is likely to have been generated by dust injection from a supernova at a time close to the beginning of the solar system, which is consistent with a trigger for solar nebula collapse, or generated directly by dust injection into the protoplanetary disk.									42	0	0	0	0	42			0004-637X			WOS:000243725400056

Modeling of fatigue fracture under stationary stochastic loading conditions								APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION				184	2			874	879		10.1016/j.amc.2006.06.078			JAN 15 2007	2007	A new effective mathematical model of fatigue fracture under stationary stochastic loading is proposed. The main idea is based on the concept of fatigue damage accumulation. Compared to the linear theory, the new model accounts for the important physical phenomenon-the influence of history of stochastic loading on the life expectancy of the structure under consideration. The problem of a distribution for the random life expectancy value is replaced by determination of the characteristic life term. The proposed model is formulated for the case when the amplitudes of stochastic loadings are distributed according to the Rayleigh distribution law and the fatigue curve can be approximated by a power function.

Inter- and intra-molecular atomic interactions in the 3WCNT + vinyl ester epoxy polymer system are represented using condensed-phased optimized molecular potential for atomistic simulation studies (COMPASS), an ab initio forcefield that enables an accurate and simultaneous prediction of various gas-phase and condensed-phase properties of organic and inorganic materials. The computational crystal consisting of a periodic array of infinitely long 3WCNTs surrounded by amorphous poly-vinyl-ester-epoxy is constructed using an in-house developed computer program and the amorphous cell tools by Accelrys. All the computations are carried out using Discover, a molecular statics/dynamics program from Accelrys.The results obtained show that covalent functionalization has a profound effect of the matrix-to-nanotube load transfer especially when the loads are applied in a direction orthogonal to the nanotube axis.

Permeability of C-60 films deposited on polycarbonatesyloxane to N-2, O-2, CH4, and He gases								APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE				253	6			3062	3065		10.1016/j.apsusc.2006.06.053			JAN 15 2007	2007	In this study, we report on the gas permeability of non-polymerized and polymerized fullerene films (thickness about 0.5 mu m) grown on an organic polymer substrate, polycarbonatesyloxane (PCS), using a high vacuum deposition method. The photopolymerized C-60 films were prepared by a simultaneous thin film deposition and UV-vis irradiation method which was reported previously [V.A. Karachevtsev, P.V. Mateichenko, N.Y. Nedbailo, A.V. Peschanskii, A.M. Plokhotnichenko, O.M. Vovk, E.N. Zubarev, A.M. Rao, Carbon 42 (2004) 2091]. Raman spectroscopy revealed that similar to 90% of the C-60 molecules are covalently linked to neighboring C-60 molecules in the photopolymerized film after 20 h of film deposition/irradiation. Permeability of the resulting membranes consisting of polymer PCS base and fullerene films to the N-2, O-2, CH4, and He gases has been investigated. Our experiments revealed that the gas permeability properties are dependent on the age of the membrane. In particular, the aged membrane exhibited an enhanced permeability for O-2 and He gases in comparison to N-2 and CH4, respectively. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Identifying these modules is essential to understand the organization of biological systems.Result: In this paper, we present a framework to identify modules within biological networks. In this approach, the concept of degree is extended from the single vertex to the sub-graph, and a formal definition of module in a network is used. A new agglomerative algorithm was developed to identify modules from the network by combining the new module definition with the relative edge order generated by the Girvan-Newman (G-N) algorithm. A JAVA program, MoNet, was developed to implement the algorithm. Applying MoNet to the yeast core protein interaction network from the database of interacting proteins (DIP) identified 86 simple modules with sizes larger than three proteins. The modules obtained are significantly enriched in proteins with related biological process Gene Ontology terms. A comparison between the MoNet modules and modules defined by Radicchi et al. (2004) indicates that MoNet modules show stronger co-clustering of related genes and are more robust to ties in betweenness values. Further, the MoNet output retains the adjacent relationships between modules and allows the construction of an interaction web of modules providing insight regarding the relationships between different functional modules. Thus, MoNet provides an objective approach to understand the organization and interactions of biological processes in cellular systems.									84	15	0	65	0	100			1367-4803	1460-2059		WOS:000243992400049	17092991

Chemical and dynamical processes in the mesospheric emissive layer: First results of stereoscopic observations								JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES				112	D1					D01306	10.1029/2005JD005891			JAN 11 2007	2007	[1] The mesospheric emissive layer is an efficient tracer of the dynamical processes propagating in the atmosphere at that level. CCD images in the near infrared taken from the ground at slant angles often reveal the existence of wavy fields. A series of such images has been transformed, using matrix operations, producing a downward satellite-type view that covers a circular area of radius similar to 1000 km at the altitude of the layer. The Fourier characteristics of the wave system are measured using a Morlet-type wavelet generator function with horizontal wavelengths of mostly similar to 20-40 km and 100-150 km and temporal periods of similar to 15-30 min. An oxygen-hydrogen model is used to evaluate the response of the emissive layer to a progressive density wave. The altitude of the layer is modulated with an amplitude of similar to 0.8-1.8 km when a density wave propagates vertically. The layer thickness is slightly modulated and is equal to similar to 7 km. Stereoscopic pairs of photographs taken simultaneously on 8-9 September 2000 at the Chateau-Renard and Pic du Midi observatories are used to obtain surface maps of the emission layer barycenter altitude. A stereocorrelation method suitable for low contrast objects without discrete contours is employed. Preliminary results for areas similar to 50x50 km(2) are presented. The surface maps of the layer barycenter altitude depict the existence of waves. They show the same wavy structure and compare favorably with the maps showing the emission intensity.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2169-897X			WOS:000243530200001

In order to provide baseline data for the scientific management of GSMNP, an All Taxa Biodiversity Inventory (ATBI) was initiated in 1998. Among the goals of the ATBI are to discover the identity and distribution of as many as possible of the species of life that occur in GSMNP. The authors have concentrated on the orders of completely aquatic insects other than odonates. We examined or utilized others' records of more than 53,600 adult and 78,000 immature insects from 545 locations. At present, 469 species are known from GSMNP, including 120 species of Ephemeroptera (mayflies), I I I species of Plecoptera (stoneflies), 7 species of Megaloptera (dobsonflies, fishflies, and alderflies), and 231 species of Trichoptera (caddisflies). Included in this total are 10 species new to science discovered since the ATBI began.					67th Annual Meeting of the Association-of-Southeastern-Biologists67th Annual Meeting of the Association-of-Southeastern-Biologists	MAR 29-APR 01, 2006MAR 29-APR 01, 2006	Assoc SE BiolAssoc SE Biol	Gatlinburg, TNGatlinburg, TN	7	0	0	7	0	7			1528-7092	1938-5412		WOS:000251793000011

Such models need validation based on empirical data to assess their accuracy. We describe and apply a new technique for assessing the accuracy of spatially explicit models. We evaluated the accuracy of South Carolina gap-analysis vertebrate models of predicted occurrence for reptile, amphibian, and mammal species on the Savannah River Site, SC, by comparing the agreement between gap-analysis models with models derived from multi-year monitoring data. We determined the species model agreement, commission and omission errors, and spatial correspondence in both single-species and richness models, and spatial correspondence of nodes of high richness. Average species agreement (accuracy) between models was 63%, with similar commission and omission error rates. Where there was spatial correspondence in single-taxon analyses, up to 15% of species identities differed in richness maps. Further refinement of vertebrate models will improve their accuracy, critical for the application of gap analyses to conservation decision-making.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1528-7092			WOS:000252263400005

In addition, a novel and linear scaling scheme, also based on pair decomposition of three-body terms, is introduced for the calculation of the heat flux. The distributed-computing-based implementation of this algorithm is outlined and its speed-up characteristics are demonstrated to be close to ideal. Example NEMD simulations using the new algorithm are performed for the Si/Ge superlattice based on the three-body Stillinger-Weber potential.									8	3	0	0	0	11			1040-7790			WOS:000249987900001

Because refuges of forest-dwelling rodents are often associated with woody debris, we examined refuge use by 37 radio-collared Peromyscus gossypinus (cotton mice) in experimental plots with different levels of woody debris. Treatment plots had six times (approximate to 60 m(3)/ha) the volume of woody debris as control plots (approximate to 10 m(3)/ha). Of 247 refuges, 159 were in rotting stumps (64%), 32 were in root boles (13%), 19 were in brush piles (8%), and 16 were in logs (6%); 10 refuges could not be identified. Stumps were the most common refuge type in both treatments, but the distribution of refuge types was significantly different between treatment and control plots. Root boles and brush piles were used more on treatment plots than on control plots, and logs were used more on control plots than on treatment plots. Refuge type and vegetation cover were the best predictors of refuge use by cotton mice; root bole refuges and refuges with less vegetation cover received greater-than-expected use by mice. Abundant refuges, particularly root boles, may improve habitat quality for cotton mice in southeastern pine forests.									7	0	0	5	0	7			1528-7092	1938-5412		WOS:000249790000002

The objectives were to evaluate CWD loadings at three forests disturbed by Hurricane Hugo, monitor soricid captures at these forests, and identify habitat associates of soricids. Pitfall traps were used to sample soricids from January 2002-December 2003, and habitat parameters (CWD, vegetation, soils, and microsite) surrounding pitfalls were sampled. We found CWD volume was significantly higher at study sites that experienced highest hurricane wind speeds. Captures of soricids were highest in forests with high CWD loadings, and regression models associated soricids with log cover and CWD volume. Sorex longirostris (southeastern shrew) was associated with logs in an advanced state of decay and woody litter. Blarina carolinensis (southern short-tailed shrew)was associated with log cover and leaf-litter cover. Soricid captures also increased with close proximity of CWD.

To in vitro- evaluate colon targetability of NGFG, apparent partition coefficient and chemical/ biochemical stability of NGFG in the contents or/ and tissue of the various segments of the gastrointestinal tract were determined. Low partition coefficient and stability of NGFG in the upper intestinal condition suggested its delivery to the colon in intact form after oral administration. Incubation with rat cecal contents produced 5- FU and its metabolite about 16%. Structural modification to enhance amide hydrolysis, the rate determining step in NGFG bioactivation, is suggested.									11	1	0	9	0	12			1061-186X			WOS:000246298300004	17454357

In this effort, real-time tuning of the lasing wavelength is accomplished through the use of colloidal crystals to provide the required reflectivity in an external resonator cavity design in which a gain medium is sandwiched between a dielectric stack and colloidal crystal. Optical pumping of the gain medium lead to a lasing peak that corresponded to the stop band of the photonic crystal. By varying the compressive strain placed on the colloidal crystal, the lasing could be tuned across the photoluminescent spectrum of the gain material. Repeated straining of the assembly did not appear to alter its proclivity to lase when photo-excited or introduce hysteresis in the lasing wavelength strain relationship. The fast response of the crystal to compressive strain could lead to pulsed organic lasers operating at kHz modulation frequencies.

Based on the average values of the pull-off force vs pH, the interaction between a glass bead and the composites can be considered as a silica-glass interaction, as confirmed by zeta potential measurements. The increase in repulsive force with increasing pH corresponds to a decrease in composite-glass adhesion. For pH between 2 and 7, the electrostatic attractive forces between polymer particles and silica surface are responsible for high particle counts.

IEEE					New tool and new process for ultra high performance for metal/high-k gate dielectric stack for sub-45 nm CMOS manufacturing								15TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED THERMAL PROCESSING OF SEMICONDUCTORS - RTP 2007								65	+					2007	2007	Off stage power dissipation and profitability are posing fundamental and practical challenges to the scaling of Si CMOS to its limit. With escalating developmental cost, off state leakage current related power dominates the CMOS heat dissipation problem making the necessity of reducing the gate leakage cur-rent density to zero, so that the designer will get relief to focus on other imposing challenges. To continue to make big gains, as we scale down from 45 nm it is important to reduce the tool cost and turn to high-k materials. In this paper we report the results of a new process and tool to deposit metal/high-k gate dielectric stack. Hafnium oxide dielectric of 0.39 nm EOT is deposited using monolayer photoassisted deposition process on a home-built system. Our process has also reliably demonstrated the success achieved with low process induced variation of the system and this is the driving factor to convincingly make this an attractive alternate choice to existing tools. The leakage current density value reported in this paper represents the lowest value reported by anyone in the open literature. This is a major breakthrough and will have major impact on the silicon IC manufacturing.					15th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Thermal Processing of Semiconductors15th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Thermal Processing of Semiconductors	OCT 02-05, 2007OCT 02-05, 2007	IEEEIEEE	Catania, ITALYCatania, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4244-1227-3	WOS:000251782400010

The n(+)-p-Si junctions were obtained from electrochemical deposited P source by Rapid Photothermal Processing enhanced diffusion for 16 s at 900 degrees C and 1000 degrees C. The emitter sheet resistivity decreased from 1100 /sq, RPP duration 60 s to 340 /sq, RPP duration 200s at 999 degrees C.The concentration profiles of P in Si after RPP enhanced diffusion were analyzed. The regime of emitter ohmic contact formation is RPP at 310 degrees C for 8-10s. The photoelectrical parameters of the obtained n(+)-p and p(+)-n-Si photovoltaic cell are respective FF=33%, =4.1% and FF-40%, =1.1%.The obtained results demonstrated that all steps of the n(+)-p and p(+)-n-Si solar cells fabrication can be realized by the Rapid Photothermal Processing technology.					29th International Semiconductor Conference (CAS 2006)29th International Semiconductor Conference (CAS 2006)	SEP 27-29, 2006SEP 27-29, 2006	Natl Inst Res & Dev Microtechnologies; Romanian Acad Electrochem Soc; IEEE Electron Devices Soc; Minist Educ & Res; IEEE Romanian Sect; IEEE, Elect Devices ChapterNatl Inst Res & Dev Microtechnologies; Romanian Acad Electrochem Soc; IEEE Electron Devices Soc; Minist Educ & Res; IEEE Romanian Sect; IEEE, Elect Devices Chapter	Sinaia, ROMANIASinaia, ROMANIA	0	0	0	0	0	0					1-4244-0109-7	WOS:000243090700034

IEEE					A file system abstraction and shell interface for a wireless sensor network testbed								2007 3RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TESTBEDS AND RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NETWORKS AND COMMUNITIES								32	41					2007	2007	Despite tremendous research interest and increased adoption, deeply embedded sensor networks are difficult to design, debug, and deploy; ultra-dependability remains an elusive goal. To address these difficulties, we have previously presented an interactive, server-centric testbed for wireless sensor networks that targets systems constructed using nesC and TinyOS - the emerging standard in sensor system development. The testbed infrastructure exposes an API suite that enables users to rapidly configure, instrument, compile, install, and profile their systems on one or more remote network deployments. The prototype deployment consists of 80 Tmote Sky devices arranged in a regular grid. The architecture is extensible in both the hardware and software dimensions to foster adoption and specialization.In this paper, we demonstrate the extensibility of the testbed software design, and present a novel file system abstraction and shell interface developed using the original API suite. The design of the new interface is informed by user feedback from client institutions where the standard graphical interface is being used to support research and teaching activities. The new shell interface complements the traditional graphical interface, reducing interaction latency, and enabling programmatic experimentation through an interpreted scripting facility. We present the design and implementation of the new testbed interface, and present a small, but representative case-study that illustrates its utility.					3rd International Conference on Testbeds and Research Infrastructure for the Development of Networks and Communities3rd International Conference on Testbeds and Research Infrastructure for the Development of Networks and Communities	MAY 21-23, 2007MAY 21-23, 2007	IEEEIEEE	Lake Buena Vista, FLLake Buena Vista, FL	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4244-0738-5	WOS:000255661600004

The novel combined sliding mode approach has been investigated in this paper to obtain robust nonlinear control scheme for nano-manipulation. First (classical) and second order (SOSM) sliding mode techniques have been developed and applied to nonlinear dynamical and uncertain model of AFM cantilever beam to track the desired trajectories. The simulation results show chattering in reaching phase of classical sliding mode and undesired trajectory twisting in sliding phase of SOSM. Hence, combined first and second order sliding mode is proposed to achieve robust chattering-free vibration control of AFM tip.					7th IEEE Conference on Nanotechnology7th IEEE Conference on Nanotechnology	AUG 02-05, 2007AUG 02-05, 2007	IEEE; IEEE Nanotechnol Council; IEEE Electron Devices Soc; Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Ctr Micro & Nano Syst; ETH, Inst Robot & Intelligent Syst; GETI; KC Wong Educ Fdn; US Army Int Technol Ctr; ACS NANO; CRC Press, Taylor & Francis Grp; intelIEEE; IEEE Nanotechnol Council; IEEE Electron Devices Soc; Chinese Univ Hong Kong, Ctr Micro & Nano Syst; ETH, Inst Robot & Intelligent Syst; GETI; KC Wong Educ Fdn; US Army Int Technol Ctr; ACS NANO; CRC Press, Taylor & Francis Grp; intel	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINAHong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4244-0607-4	WOS:000261434900023

First, a robust adaptive controller is proposed and proven to yield semi-global asymptotic tracking in the presence of additive disturbances and parametric uncertainty. In addition to guaranteeing an asymptotic output tracking result, it is also proven that the parameter estimate vector is driven to a constant vector. In the second part of the paper, a learning controller is designed and proven to yield a semi-global asymptotic tracking result in the presence of additive disturbances where the desired trajectory is periodic. A continuous nonlinear integral feedback component is utilized in the design of both controllers and Lyapunov-based techniques are used to guarantee that the tracking error is asymptotically driven to zero. Numerical simulation results are presented for both controllers.					26th American Control Conference26th American Control Conference	JUL 09-13, 2007JUL 09-13, 2007		New  York, NYNew  York, NY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0743-1619		978-1-4244-0988-4	WOS:000252258801046

The system comprises of a cantilever beam with a piezoelectric patch actuator deposited on the beam surface, connected in a capacitance bridge network. The goal is to estimate the mass of a particle deposited on the cantilever tip by measuring the associated shift in the beam natural frequency. The piezoelectric patch behaves as a self-sensing actuator. Accurate balance of the capacitance bridge is a key requirement for the self-sensing network to function properly. In this paper, a prediction-error-based mechanism is presented to estimate the actuator capacitance and keep the bridge dynamically balanced. The adaptation law uses a generalized form of the gradient estimation method. Lyapunov-based stability analysis is carried out to prove the global stability of the law. A modified gradient estimation method, which is relatively easy to implement, is shown to be a special case of the generalized mechanism. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the working of this estimation strategy.					26th American Control Conference26th American Control Conference	JUL 09-13, 2007JUL 09-13, 2007		New  York, NYNew  York, NY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0743-1619		978-1-4244-0988-4	WOS:000252258802133

IEEE					A real time re-configurable steering simulator for system design studies								2007 AMERICAN CONTROL CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-13		Proceedings of the American Control Conference						3760	+					2007	2007	The automotive steering system plays an important role in determining the behavioral dynamics of the operator/vehicle interface. The system's primary function is to transmit the driver commanded steering wheel angle to the road wheels; The secondary function is to provide tire/road interface information back to the driver. The automotive chassis engineer needs a design tool to evaluate the effect of steering parameters on overall vehicle lateral behavior. In this paper, a real time steering simulator will be presented to emulate the behavior of automotive steering systems. The re-configurable steer-by-wire simulator allows for the emulation of steering systems ranging from hydraulic, electric and steer-by-wire in passenger, light duty, and commercial vehicles for pre-production and production models. To validate the simulator's functionality, a case study has been performed with numerical and experimental data. Comparisons between the simulator results and field data demonstrate a high level of correspondence.

Mathematical models of these subsystems, based on the physics of the processes involved, consist of time-varying nonlinear ODEs. The diagnostic problem is approached in hierarchical fashion, and this paper focuses on a high-level (supervisory) diagnosis aimed at distinguishing between faults in the alternator and battery subsystems. The proposed diagnostic approach is based on the generation of residuals using system models and through comparison of the predicted and measured value of selected variables, including alternator output current, field voltage, battery current, battery voltage and engine speed.

Dedicated subsystem level MIPC controllers are developed that control a fuel cell and an ultracapacitor current and enforce point-wise-in-time constraints of each subsystem independently of each other. A simple supervisory scheme determines the power split between the fuel cell and the ultracapacitor. Nonlinear simulations show that the decentralized control design is successful in enforcing subsystem level constraints while achieving system-level power demand. The proposed decentralized approach has practical advantages over a centralized MPC design because of its potential to decrease online computations and more importantly because of its compatibility with a modular software/hardware architecture.					26th American Control Conference26th American Control Conference	JUL 09-13, 2007JUL 09-13, 2007		New  York, NYNew  York, NY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0743-1619		978-1-4244-0988-4	WOS:000252258803057

Specifically, the paper investigates the development of an adaptive position controller that compensates for select system parameters such as mass and drag coefficients and also for an unknown thrust configuration matrix which is the result of unknown tugboat locations. The control design is facilitated by strategic placement of the tugs about the vessel hull such that it does not require transmission of information between the tugs. Performance of the controller is investigated by simulations for a scaled model of a surface vessel.					26th American Control Conference26th American Control Conference	JUL 09-13, 2007JUL 09-13, 2007		New  York, NYNew  York, NY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0743-1619		978-1-4244-0988-4	WOS:000252258803107

IEEE					Performance aware secure code partitioning								2007 DESIGN, AUTOMATION & TEST IN EUROPE CONFERENCE & EXHIBITION, VOLS 1-3		Design Automation and Test in Europe Conference and Exhibition						1122	+					2007	2007	Many embedded applications exist where decisions are made using sensitive information. A critical issue in such applications is to ensure that data is accessed only v by authorized computing entities. In many scenarios, these entities do not rely on each other, yet they need to work on a secure application in parallel to complete application execution under the specified deadline. Our focus in this paper is on compiler-guided secure code partitioning among a set of hosts. The scenario targeted involves a set of hosts that want to execute a secure embedded application in parallel. The various hosts have different levels of access to the data structures manipulated in the application. Our approach partitions the application among the hosts such that the load imbalance across hosts is minimized to reduce execution time while ensuring that no security leak occurs.

Compared with traditional broadcast methods, it reduces spectrum requirements by taking advantage of the fact that not all program channels are being viewed by subscribers at the same time. The actual spectrum savings depends on human TV watching behavior, the popularity of delivered TV programs, streaming bit-rate composition and subscriber group size. We have developed a simulation model of an SDB system that allows us to explore the impact of these factors, in particular subscriber's channel flipping behavior, on the capacity requirement. Our subscriber viewing model ranges from intense, correlated channel flipping behavior to minimal flipping behavior representing DVR usage. Our results suggest that frequent channel flipping has little effect on the spectrum requirements under normal viewing assumptions.					4th International Conference on Broadband Communications Networks and Systems4th International Conference on Broadband Communications Networks and Systems	SEP 10-14, 2007SEP 10-14, 2007		Raleigh, NCRaleigh, NC	1	0	0	0	0	1					978-1-4244-1432-1	WOS:000258851300054

While BitTorrent applications contribute to the demand for high speed broadband access, they also contribute to the undesirable 80/20 effect wherein 80% of the bandwidth is consumed by 20% of the users. In this study we explore the impact that BitTorrent users can have on a DOCSIS cable network. We began the study by capturing packet traces of BitTorrent applications operating on two commercial DOCSIS cable networks. Next we developed for the ns-2 simulation tool a configurable mix of BitTorrent, Web browsing, and VoIP workloads and verified that the behavior of the simulated BitTorrent workloads to be consistent with the behavior observed on the commercial network. In this simulated environment, we show that as few as 15 BitTorrent users can significantly reduce the service quality experienced by other subscribers.					4th International Conference on Broadband Communications Networks and Systems4th International Conference on Broadband Communications Networks and Systems	SEP 10-14, 2007SEP 10-14, 2007		Raleigh, NCRaleigh, NC	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4244-1432-1	WOS:000258851300056

A number of compute-intensive scientific applications, therefore, can potentially benefit from commodity computing devices available in the form of co-processor accelerators. However, there has been little progress in accelerating production-level scientific applications using these technologies due to several programming and performance challenges. One of the key performance challenges is performance sustainability. While computation is often accelerated substantially by accelerator devices, the achievable performance is significantly lower once the data transfer costs and overheads are incorporated. We present an application-specific memory characterization technique for an FPGA-accelerated system that enabled us to reduce data transfer overhead by a factor of five for a production-scale scientific application. Our proposed technique extends to applications that exhibit similar memory behavior and to co-processor accelerator systems that support data streaming, pipelining, and overlapped execution.					18th IEEE International Conference on Application-Specific Systems, Architectures and Processors18th IEEE International Conference on Application-Specific Systems, Architectures and Processors	JUL 08-11, 2007JUL 08-11, 2007	IEEEIEEE	Montreal, CANADAMontreal, CANADA	0	0	0	0	0	0			1063-6862		978-1-4244-1026-2	WOS:000255432100055

An online tool is then implemented to search the top N genes having similar biological functions with a particular gene within the same or cross different species.

One class consists of the high-rate (11 Mbps and 5.5 Mbps) signals employed in the IEEE 802.11b standard, and the other class includes full-rate (11 Mbps) complex signals derived from biorthogonal sequences and half-rate (5.5 Mbps) biorthogonal signals. We examine several types of complementary properties of each class of signals and give performance comparisons for the signals when employed on channels in which thermal noise is the only disturbance and channels with thermal noise and multipath interference. For standard IEEE 802.11b complementary-code-key (CCK) modulation, we find the performance is strongly dependent on the differential multipath delay. For systems that employ binary error-control coding, the signals that are based on biorthogonal modulation are superior to the two IEEE 802.11b CCK signal sets.

In this paper we look at the problem of tracking a person's head and also estimating its pose in each frame. Robust tracking can be achieved by reducing the dimensionality of high-dimensional training data and using the recovered low-dimensional structure to estimate the state of an object at every time-step with recursive Bayesian filtering. Isometric feature mapping, also known as Isomap, provides an unsupervised framework to find the true degrees of freedom in high-dimensional input data like a person's head with varying poses. After the data has been reduced to lower dimensions a particle filter can be used to track and at the same time approximate the pose of a person's head in any image sequence. Isomap tracking with particle filtering is capable of handling rapid translation and out-of-plane rotation of a person's head with a relatively small amount of training data. The performance of the tracker is demonstrated on an image sequence with a person's head undergoing translation and out-of-plane rotation.

IEEE					User experience design for technical communication: Expanding our notions of quality information design								2007 IEEE INTERNATIONAL PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION CONFERENCE								300	312					2007	2007	Information design has traditionally favored instrumentalist and rationalist models of communication over more rich, experienced-based models, defining a 'good' text as one that enables users meet their goals with expedience. This paper critiques the expedient view of information design by offering a brief history of information design, and then presenting an alternative perspective derived from experience design literature to show what might characterize an expanded notion of information design. This new model argues for addressing people's emotional, psychological, physical, and social needs, as well as their cognitive ones and thereby redefining a 'good' text as one that embraces the complexity of humanity. This expanded notion of information design embodies Jurgen Habermas' concept of communicative rationality which counters the ethic of expedience inherent in most information design literature and practice.

Here, the accuracy of inductive and capacitive coupling algorithms are verified through representative measurements of crosstalk within an automobile. Worst-case estimates used by the algorithms are compared to measured values and are compared to values estimated using statistical methods. The worst-case algorithms performed well up to 10-20 MHz, but overestimated measured results by several dB in some cases and up to 10-15 dB in others. An approximate statistical variation of the current expert system algorithms also worked well and can help avoid overestimation of problems; however, worst-case estimates better ensure that problems will not be missed, especially in the absence of complete system information.

Hermitian codes, which are also nonbinary codes, have been suggested as alternatives because they have longer block lengths for the same alphabet size. More recently, construction methods and efficient iterative decoding techniques have been developed for nonbinary quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. For channels in which the only disturbance is thermal noise, nonbinary quasi-cyclic LDPC codes with iterative decoding have been shown to be superior to Reed-Solomon codes of the same block length. We compare the performance of LDPC, Hermitian, and Reed-Solomon codes for frequency-hop transmission over channels with partial-band jamming. Performance results are also included for interleaved binary product codes with iterative decoding. Comparisons are made for nonbinary orthogonal modulation with coherent and noncoherent demodulation.

Synchronization between terminals is required in these networks to support reliable time-slotted transmissions and, in some cases, periodic network control phases. A common global time reference, such as a beacon from a base station or a GPS time signal, may not be available to all terminals at all times. Distributed terminal initialization and clock drift may lead to a situation in which several groups of terminals are locally synchronized, but lack a common global synchronization We introduce a distributed protocol designed to respond to and correct synchronization differences between groups of terminals. When a synchronization difference is detected, the Protocol first attempts to resolve the synchronization ambiguity, i.e. determine which synchronization is correct. The protocol then provides an orderly process of silencing and re-synchronizing portions of the network so that terminals may adopt a common synchronization. The basic properties of the protocol are analyzed and verified through simulation.

Specifically, the technology provisions of mesh mode operation and terminal mobility allow a tactical network to be quickly deployed among mobile base stations and mobile battle units. The technology provides essential support for mesh connectivity and fast handover, while an overall deployment strategy and higher layer protocols remain to be established. This paper presents a practical network organization scheme and an integrated routing and link scheduling approach to enable persistent communication of fast moving ground vehicles over a mesh-mode Mobile WiMAX tactical backbone network.

IEEE					A cross-layer multiple-access protocol with adaptive transmission for direct-sequence spread-spectrum ad hoc networks								2007 IEEE MILITARY COMMUNICATIONS CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-8		IEEE Military Communications Conference						2819	2825					2007	2007	We introduce a protocol for direct-sequence spread-spectrum ad hoc networks that enables simultaneous transmissions while limiting multiple-access interference. Our protocol establishes channel-access restrictions to prevent excessive levels of multiple-access interference and enables efficient operation of adaptive transmission. Each radio uses cross-layer metrics to identify neighboring radios which could cause detrimental levels of multiple-access interference. We implement and evaluate the distributed protocol in a simulation that models the multiple-access interference for each packet transmission. We show that our cross-layer protocol significantly increases network throughput compared to protocols that do not jointly control channel access and adaptive transmission.

Miniaturized electronics integrated in part or in whole, is necessary to achieve these goals. Electronic design considerations, often unique to implants, takes into account the medical application, transducer technology, telemetry, and level of integration. In this paper, we discuss the salient issues most commonly encountered in designing mixed-signal Integrated electronics for wireless implantable sensing devices. Our goal is to develop a general electronics platform that may be readily applied to many types of transducer technologies with little or no modification to the core platform. Two case studies are analyzed.

IEEE					Hierarchical state estimation applied to wide-area power systems								2007 IEEE POWER ENGINEERING SOCIETY GENERAL MEETING, VOLS 1-10		IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting						133	+					2007	2007	This paper discusses the application of the hierarchical state estimation technique to wide-area monitoring. A wide-area network comprised of a large number of interconnections between various utilities requires monitoring of the entire system. Hierarchical state estimation can be modified to consolidate the state outputs from the existing state estimators of the individual entities in a wide area. This type of estimation is faster than an integrated state estimate of a wide area. However, problems such as delay of state output arrival, loss of state output of an area, overlap of areas and asynchronism of state estimate cycle occur. These problems are addressed in this research through the modification of the traditional hierarchical state estimation. Specifically, synchronized phasors are used in the hierarchical state estimation structure to improve the performance of the overall state estimation. The state estimator is run on the IEEE 118 bus system with phasor measurements in a selected number of buses. The results of the use of phasor measurements in various levels of the hierarchical state estimation are presented here.

IEEE					Two-level state estimation for multi-area power system								2007 IEEE POWER ENGINEERING SOCIETY GENERAL MEETING, VOLS 1-10		IEEE Power Engineering Society General Meeting						3904	3909					2007	2007	This paper presents a two-level state estimator for multi-area interconnected power system. In the first level of the algorithm, each area runs their own state estimator using the measurements obtained from its own area. In the second level of the algorithm, the central coordinator collects the state estimation results from the individual areas and coordinates them to get the multi-area state estimation with respect to a global reference. The use of measurements from synchronized phasor measurement units along with conventional measurements from the boundary network is justified and implemented to increase the accuracy of the two-level state estimator. The algorithm is implemented on the IEEE 30-bus and a 1896-bus real world system.

IEEE					Person following with a mobile robot using binocular feature-based tracking								2007 IEEE/RSJ INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT ROBOTS AND SYSTEMS, VOLS 1-9								821	826					2007	2007	We present the Binocular Sparse Feature Segmentation (BSFS) algorithm for vision-based person following with a mobile robot. BSFS uses Lucas-Kanade feature detection and matching in order to determine the location of the person in the image and thereby control the robot. Matching is performed between two images of a stereo pair, as well as between successive video frames. We use the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) scheme for segmenting the sparse disparity map and estimating the motion models of the person and background. By fusing motion and stereo information, BSFS handles difficult situations such as dynamic backgrounds, out-of-plane rotation, and similar disparity and/or motion between the person and background. Unlike color-based approaches, the person is not required to wear clothing with a different color from the environment. Our system is able to reliably follow a person in complex dynamic, cluttered environments in real time.

First the gravitational potential energy of the manipulator is derived. Then, the elastic potential energy of the manipulator is derived for both bending and extension. Finally, the effects of the total potential energy are included in the dynamic model. Numerical simulation results are presented for a planar 3-section extensible continuum robot manipulator. The results show a much stronger match to physical continuum robots than with previously available models.

This constraint requires that any job completing the first processing step must be started on the succeeding second machine within some allowable time window; otherwise, the job must repeat its processing on the first step. We present a random keys implementation of NSGA-II for our problem of interest and investigate the efficacy of different hatching policies in terms of the number of approximate efficient solutions that are produced by NSGA-II over a wide range of experimental problem instances. Experimental results suggest a full batch policy can produce superior solutions as compared to greedy batching policies under the experimental conditions examined.

IEEE					Resource consumption in dynamic spectrum access networks: Applications and Shannon limits								2007 INFORMATION THEORY AND APPLICATIONS WORKSHOP								321	+					2007	2007	When a frequency band has been selected for a session in a dynamic spectrum access network, the initial choices for the modulation and coding must be consistent with the bandwidth that is available and the session's quality-of-service priorities. A measure of resource consumption is developed for use in the selection of the code-modulation combination. The resource-consumption metric accounts for the bandwidth, data-transmission time, and transmitted power for the session. Shannon capacity limits are employed to bound the resource consumption and permit tradeoffs between the time-bandwidth product of the signals and the amount of power that must be transmitted to achieve reliable communication.

Although finding the minimum connected dominating set (MCDS) in an arbitrary graph is a NP-hard problem, many algorithms have been proposed to construct an approximation of the MCDS for efficient routing in wireless sensor networks. To address the weaknesses of these existing algorithms, we propose a new distributed MCDS approximation algorithm, CDS-HG, to construct the CDS for wireless sensor networks. This algorithm models a wireless sensor network as a hierarchical graph and uses a competition-based strategy to select nodes at a certain hierarchical level to route messages for nodes in the next level of the hierarchical graph. Formal analysis and simulation studies show that our CDS-HG algorithm generates smaller CDS sizes while requiring less communication overhead compared with the existing distributed MCDS approximation algorithms.					3rd International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing (WiCOM 2007)3rd International Conference on Wireless Communications, Networking and Mobile Computing (WiCOM 2007)	SEP 21-25, 2007SEP 21-25, 2007	IEEE Commun Soc; IEEE EngnManagement Soc; Shanghai Jiaotong Univ; Wuhan UnivIEEE Commun Soc; IEEE EngnManagement Soc; Shanghai Jiaotong Univ; Wuhan Univ	Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINAShanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA	1	0	0	0	0	1					978-1-4244-1311-9	WOS:000262098301305

Recent major blackouts around the world and deregulation of power systems require the operators to have a wide area view of the power system to operate it securely and reliably. Wide area state estimation is one of the functions that can provide the operators with such a view. Two-level state estimation can provide the information of the system on wide area basis regardless of the size of the system and without any data exchange between the areas of the grid. The system selected for the simulation is 1896-bus real world system consisting of four areas.

While a firm in a two-firm situation has to decide either sharing nothing or sharing all, a firm in a three-firm situation has an additional decision to determine with which firm it should form coalition.

These three types of function; however, capture human behavior. Linear, concave, and convex utility functions are employed for players who prefer risk-neutral, risk averse, and risk loving, respectively.

In previous work, we presented a contract formalism for specifying patterns precisely, and showed how the use of the formalism can amplify the benefits of patterns. In this paper, our goal is to enable practitioners to test whether their systems, as implemented, meet the requirements, as specified in the pattern contracts, corresponding to the correct usage of the patterns underlying the systems' designs. In our testing approach, corresponding to each design pattern, there is a set of what we call pattern test case templates (PTCTs). A PTCT codifies a reusable test case structure designed to identify defects associated with applications of the particular pattern. The test assertions in the PTCT are based on the requirements specified in the appropriate pattern contract Next we present a process using which, given any system designed using the pattern, the system tester can generate a test suite from the PTCTs for that pattern that can be used to test the system for bugs in the implementation of the particular pattern. The process allows the system tester to tailor the test suite the needs of the individual system by specifying a set of specialization rules that are designed to reflect the structure and the scenarios in which the defects codified in the PTCTs are likely to manifest themselves in the particular system.					31st Annual IEEE Software Engineering Workshop31st Annual IEEE Software Engineering Workshop	MAR 06-08, 2007MAR 06-08, 2007	IEEE Comp Soc TCSEIEEE Comp Soc TCSE	Loyola Coll, Baltimore, MDLoyola Coll, Baltimore, MD	0	0	0	0	0	0			1550-6215		978-0-7695-2862-5	WOS:000251715800012

Experience reveals this to be especially difficult for programs that involve pointers or references and linked data structures. In some situations, pointers are unavoidable; in some others, verification can be simplified through suitable abstractions. Regardless, a verifying compiler should be able to handle both cases, preferably using the same set of rules. To illustrate how this can be done, we examine two approaches to full verification. One replaces language supplied indirection with software components whose specifications abstract pointers and pointer manipulation operations. Another approach uses abstract specifications to encapsulate data structures that pointers and references are often used to implement, limiting verification complications to inside the implementations of these components. Using a modular, specification-based tool we have developed for verification condition generation, we show that full verification of programs with and without the direct use of pointers can be handled similarly. There is neither a need to focus on selected pointer properties, such as the absence of null references or cycles, nor a need for special rules to handle pointers.					31st Annual IEEE Software Engineering Workshop31st Annual IEEE Software Engineering Workshop	MAR 06-08, 2007MAR 06-08, 2007	IEEE Comp Soc TCSEIEEE Comp Soc TCSE	Loyola Coll, Baltimore, MDLoyola Coll, Baltimore, MD	1	0	0	0	0	1			1550-6215		978-0-7695-2862-5	WOS:000251715800021

Determinations of the star formation rate are based on several distinct tracers: The, stellar light component is reprocessed to IR emission by the dust content of the ISM, recombination radiation leads to Ha emission, and particle acceleration in supernova remnant (SNR) shocks leads to a gamma-ray continuum. Stellar ejection of radioactive material adds a gamma-ray line glow that can be utilized to measure the star formation activity on a galaxy-wide scale. We promote using the 1.809 MeV gamma-ray line due to the decay of Al-26 as a powerful technique to measure the global (the Galaxy is transparent to MeV gamma-rays) long-term average (the mean life of Al-26 is similar to 1 Myr) star formation rate. This method is compared to standard approaches that rely on scaling the supernova rates in external galaxies to the Milky Way, or the modelling of tracer objects that require significant corrections for evolution, or extinction. We describe the value and limitations of the "Al-26-method", which may prove to be one of the most accurate methods once reliable yields are available.					6th Integral Workshop on the Obscured Universe6th Integral Workshop on the Obscured Universe	JUL 02-08, 2006JUL 02-08, 2006	Space Res Inst; European Space Agcy; Russian Acad Sci; Russian Basic Res FdnSpace Res Inst; European Space Agcy; Russian Acad Sci; Russian Basic Res Fdn	Space Res Inst, Moscow, RUSSIASpace Res Inst, Moscow, RUSSIA	1	0	0	0	0	1			0379-6566		*****************	WOS:000253876500014

Car following behavior and the decision-making habits of drivers seem fundamental to understanding how to avoid these rear-end crashes. The present research aimed to reveal factors that govern car following under conditions of reduced visibility. It employed a KQ-Vection high-fidelity driving simulator to measure the behavior of automobile drivers following a lead vehicle at 13.4 m/s (30 MPH) or 22.4 m/s (50 MPH) under three visibility conditions-clear or one of two densities of simulated fog. At the higher speed, fog conditions separated participants into a group that stayed within visible range of the lead car, even though the headway time violated the NHTSA recommendations for the speed involved, and another group that lagged beyond the visible range. Data were compared to the model of Van Winsum for car following (The human element in car following models. Transportation Research Part F 2, 1999).

This article reviews techniques for real-time simulation of arbitrary visual fields over still images and video. The goal is to provide the vision sciences and perceptual graphics communities techniques for the investigation of fundamental processes of visual perception. Classic gaze-contingent displays used for these purposes are reviewed and for the first time a pixel shader is introduced for display of a high-resolution window over peripherally degraded stimulus. The pixel shader advances current state-of-the-art by allowing real-time processing of still or streamed images, obviating the need for preprocessing or storage.									10	0	0	1	0	10			1551-6857	1551-6865		WOS:000252315900006		
S	Bashash, Saeid; Jalili, Nader						Matsuzaki, Y; Ahmadian, M; Leo, DJ		Modeling of piezo-flexural nanopositioning systems subjected to rate-varying inputs								ACTIVE AND PASSIVE SMART STRUCTURES AND INTEGRATED SYSTEMS 2007		Proceedings of SPIE		6525						652529	10.1117/12.715818			2007	2007	A general modeling scheme is proposed for precision positioning of piezoelectrically-driven flexural systems. To describe the nonlinear behavior of the structure while also considering the system dynamics, a second order linear dynamic model subjected to nonlinear hysteretic input is first adopted. Using the memory-dependent properties of hysteresis nonlinearity, a new mathematical framework is then proposed for describing this phenomenon. More specifically, a nonlinear mapping strategy is proposed for the approximation of each of the ascending and descending multiple-loop hysteresis curves based on the shape of hysteresis reference curves. The trace of internal hysteresis trajectory is, however, obtained based on the locations of the past turning points, corresponding to the input extrema. Experimental tests are carried out on a dual-axis piezoelectrically-driven flexural stage to demonstrate the contribution of dynamic and hysteresis models, individually and combined together, on the improvement of the model response. Results indicate that the proposed hysteresis model can effectively predict the nonlinear response of the system, while the influence of dynamic model is more apparent for high rate inputs.

However, majority of studies concerns model systems, which do not incorporate real abrasive particles. The approach applied allows measuring adhesion between real CMP nanoparticles; and different surfaces. Thin polymer film with high affinity to the particles was used to anchor the particles to a surface. Hollow glass bead (20-30 mu m) representing flat surface was attached to soft AFM cantilever. Application of large hollow bead and the cantilever with small spring constant allows measuring the interactions with high sensitivity. Titanium, tungsten and tantalum metals were sputtered on the bead surface. The effect of different factors such as pH value, concentration and type of a surfactant on adhesion between surfaces of metals and silica slurry has been studied. Character and intensity of interactions at the moment of contact have been evaluated from experimental force-distance curves.

Phosphate uptake on metal (oxy)hydroxide and phyllosilicate mineral surfaces and in soils generally increases with decreasing pH. Rapid adsorption kinetics is generally observed on many soil adsorbents at acidic pH. P fixation mechanisms such as inner-sphere complexation and intra- and interparticle diffusion often result in slow P release (i.e., hysteresis and irreversible reactions), creating challenges in remediating agricultural soils with high accumulations of P. This chapter covers some of the historical soil P chemical research findings via macroscopic approaches but focuses on more recent molecular scale approaches for elucidating P retention/release mechanisms.

An increasing number of companies are using teams to leverage the knowledge and experience of their employees in order to improve quality, reduce costs and 'delight' the customer. The growing prevalence of teams signals the need to examine the adequacy of management accounting information and its use in performance measurement and control systems.Some research has examined the impact of team empowerment on creativity and innovation, while other research discusses the sometimes-hampering role of performance measures in team environments. This paper contributes to this research, with two major goals. First, it discusses innovation and empowerment and examines how performance measurement can both encourage and hinder team performance. The second purpose is to propose a team performance measurement system using ratios based on activity-based management that seeks to encourage innovation and empowerment while maintaining a system of control.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1474-7871		978-0-7623-1387-7	WOS:000270870300010

Since 2005, the radar has been operated in a high-power MST-ISR mode for 3-day runs four times per year to study the seasonal variation of mesospheric echoes. Doppler spectra are obtained with 1 min and 150-m nominal resolution yielding power, horizontal and vertical winds, and spectral width. The rich echo structures contain braids and billows suggestive of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI). We present three cases; (1) a short sequence of billows growing in height and becoming unstable; (2) a long train of billows showing high levels of turbulence at two different locations; and (3) a series of billows passing only slowly through the field of view. In all cases, the layers were associated with strong wind shears, mature billows were 1-1.5 km tall, and separation of KH phase fronts was 8-10 km. We compare our observations with OH imager observation and numerical simulations.

Since 2002, the radar was operated for a certain number of days each year collecting 1-min Doppler spectra in four off vertical (2.5 degrees) beam directions and 150 m resolution. The spectral widths have been used to compute the kinetic energy dissipation rate a due to atmospheric turbulence. A small beam broadening effect has been removed from the observed spectral widths.The daily median energy dissipation rates epsilon increase from 5 to 30 mW/kg between 67 and 80 km, and the eddy diffusivities increase from 3 to 20 m(2)/s, consistent with similar studies conducted by two other large 50-MHz radars in Japan and India. The energy dissipation rates are about the same magnitude as the a estimates for low-latitudes from a global model and are larger than the averages from rocket observations at high-latitudes, confirming previous comparisons.

Results indicated that ethnic differences in alcohol problems were similar in the delinquent and nondelinquent groups, with whites reporting higher levels of alcohol problems. In contrast, age differences were smaller among delinquents than nondelinquents, which pointed to a heightened risk for both alcohol and marijuana problems among younger delinquents.

J	Nation, T. H.								The influence of flowering dogwood (Cornus florida) on land snail diversity in a southern mixed hardwood forest								AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST				157	1			137	148		10.1674/0003-0031(2007)157[137:TIOFDC]2.0.CO;2			JAN 2007	2007	In many areas, soil calcium is an important limiting factor for land snail distributions. Some tree species are able to extract calcium from lower soil depths, concentrate it in their leaves and deliver it to the surface upon leaf fall. Flowering dogwood (Cornus florida) is an example of a "calcium-pumping" species and has been suggested to promote land snail diversity in woodland ecosystems. In this study, leaf tissue calcium, O- and B-horizon soil calcium and land snail diversity were compared for three common understory tree species: flowering dogwood, American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and blackgum (Nyssa sylvatica). Using a litter sieving technique, land snails were sampled underneath these three focal tree species. Land snail density, species richness and diversity were estimated for a total of 19 trees. As expected, B-horizon soil calcium was similar across all tree species, while leaf tissue calcium and O-horizon soil calcium were significantly higher for flowering dogwood. Land snail density, species richness and diversity (Shannon-Wiener Index) were also significantly higher for flowering dogwood. Calcium-pumping tree species are important ecosystem components in that they increase soil fertility and promote invertebrate diversity. Land snails are an important food and calcium source for a variety of woodland species including passerine birds, woodland salamanders, cychrine beetles, and wild turkeys. Flowering dogwood is currently seriously threatened in the southeastern United States by the parasitic dogwood anthracnose fungus (Discula destructiva). In light of the findings of this study, the implications of dogwood anthracnose may reach beyond the target species and impact multiple taxa.									6	0	0	7	0	7			0003-0031			WOS:000243956000012

In this work a green tea tincture was characterized for a series of catechin components (catechin, epicatechin, epigallocatechin, and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)) and caffeine. Special emphasis was given to EGCG and caffeine, because they are important in determining the possible health effects of the green tea. The effects of instrument operating conditions were evaluated for the EI and GD ionization sources to determine their effect on analyte intensities and fragmentation patterns. These studies furnished information about the effects of these conditions in determining possible ionization pathways in the two ion sources. The mass spectra of these compounds obtained with the GD ion source are EI-like in appearance, with clearly identified molecular ions and fragmentation patterns that are easily rationalized. The absolute limits of detection for EGCG and caffeine were, respectively, 11 ng and 0.77 ng for the EI source and 3.2 ng and 0.61 ng for the GD source. The PB/EIMS and PB/GDMS combinations can be operated in a flow-injection mode, wherein the analyte is injected directly into the mobile phase, or coupled to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), enabling LC-MS analysis of complex mixtures. A reversed-phase chromatographic separation of the green tea tincture was performed on a commercial C-18 column using a gradient of water (containing 0.1% TFA) and ACN. Quantification of EGCG and caffeine was performed by the standard addition method. The amounts of EGCG and caffeine in the tested green tea tincture were each similar to 14 mg mL(-1).									16	0	0	9	0	16			1618-2642			WOS:000242968000047	17139484

Both sulphur programmes, applied six or 11 times at 15 kg ha 21, controlled scab equally well in both years on cultivars (cvs) Contender and Cresthaven. Six applications of a half dosage of both micronised and non-micronised sulphur programmes were significantly less effective (P < 0.05) compared with all other programmes when scab incidence was > 90% on cv. Contender. None of the sulphur programmes influenced significantly (P < 0.05) colouration and flesh firmness of harvested fruits compared with the industry standard ( a chlorothalonil-captan programme). Only soluble solids concentrations showed significant differences among fungicide programmes (P < 0.05), but these differences were not consistent with either particle sizes of sulphur fungicide or reduced application fungicide programmes. In conclusion, our study showed that (a) micronised sulphur did not control peach scab more effectively compared to non-micronised sulphur; (b) six applications of sulphur were sufficient to control peach scab when disease pressure was low to medium; and (c) neither six nor 11 applications of sulphur-based products applied at 15 kg ha 21 had commercially relevant negative impacts on important peach fruit quality variables.									7	0	0	7	0	7			0003-4746	1744-7348		WOS:000245691600003

This growth has not been supported adequately by rigorous research to address challenges such as arthropod pest management. The research that has been conducted, however, is complemented by research in aspects of conventional agriculture that may have applicability in organic systems, as well as by research in underpinning fields such as applied ecology. This article synthesizes the available literature in relation to a conceptual model of arthropod pest management strategies suitable for organic systems. The present work uses the four phases of the model to review the strategies in an agroecological context and provides a synthesis of the factors that influence the success of each phase. Rather than constituting a fringe science, pest management research for organic systems draws on cutting edge science in fields such as landscape and chemical ecology and has a bright future.									226	11	2	207	10	247			0066-4170	1545-4487		WOS:000243653800005	16846384

Morris, Robert/C-5188-2012; Richardson, Ruth/B-8265-2017				Comparative proteomics of Dehalococcoides spp. reveals strain-specific peptides associated with activity								APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY				73	1			320	326		10.1128/AEM.02129-06			JAN 2007	2007	Anaerobic reductive dehalogenation by Dehalococcoides spp. is an ideal system for studying functional diversity of closely related strains of bacteria. In Dehalococcoides spp., reductive dehalogenases (RDases) are key respiratory enzymes involved in the anaerobic detoxification of halogenated compounds at contaminated sites globally. Although housekeeping genes sequenced from Dehalococcoides spp. are > 85% identical at the amino acid level, different strains are capable of dehalogenating diverse ranges of compounds, depending largely on the suite of RDase genes that each strain harbors and expresses. We identified RDase proteins that corresponded to known functions in four characterized cultures and predicted functions in an uncharacterized Dehalococcoides-containing mixed culture. Homologues within RDase subclusters containing PceA, TceA, and VcrA were among the most frequently identified proteins. Several additional proteins, including a formate dehydrogenase-like protein (Fdh), had high coverage in all strains and under all growth conditions.									73	0	0	69	0	74			0099-2240			WOS:000243394400036	17098919

In this work, the use of heterogeneous base catalysts derived from Mg-Al hydrotalcite was investigated for the conversion of poultry lipids to biodiesel. This solid base showed high activity for triglyceride (TG) transesteritication with methanol without signs of catalyst leaching. Catalytic performance was significantly affected by pretreatment and operating conditions. Calcination at optimum temperature was key in obtaining the highest catalyst activities. Rehydration of the calcined catalyst before reaction using wet nitrogen decreased catalytic activity for the transesterification of poultry fat, opposite to what has been reported for condensation reactions. Also, methanol had to be contacted with the catalyst before reaction; otherwise, catalyst activity was seriously impaired by strong adsorption of triglycerides on the active sites. Both temperature (60-120 degrees C) and methanol-to-lipid molar ratio (6:1-60: 1) affected the reaction rate in a positive manner. The use of a co-solvent (hexane, toluene, THF), however, gave rise to a change in TG conversion profile which cannot be explained solely by a dilution effect. The catalyst underwent significant deactivation during the first reaction cycle probably due to deactivation of the strongest base sites. Subsequent reaction cycles showed stable activity. By re-calcination in air, complete catalyst regeneration was achieved.(C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									140	5	0	20	4	144			0926-860X			WOS:000250510100019

S	Salehi-Khojin, Amin; Jalili, Nader						Dapino, MJ		Axially compressed buckling of an embedded boron nitride nanotube subjected to thermo-electro-mechanical loadings - art. no. 652621								Behavior and Mechanics of Multifunctional and Composite Materials 2007		PROCEEDINGS OF THE SOCIETY OF PHOTO-OPTICAL INSTRUMENTATION ENGINEERS (SPIE)		6526				52621	52621	652621	10.1117/12.715820			2007	2007	Unlike widely-used carbon nanotubes, boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) have shown to possess stable semiconducting behavior and strong piezoelectricity. Such properties along with their outstanding mechanical properties and thermal conductivity, make BNNTs promising candidate reinforcement materials for a verity of applications especially nanoelectronic and nanophotonic devices. Motivated by these abilities, we aim to study the buckling behavior of BNNT reinforced piezoelectric polymeric composites when subjected to combined electro-thermo-mechanical loadings. For this, the multi-walled structure of BNNT is considered as elastic media and a set of concentric cylindrical shell with van der Waals interaction between them. Using three-dimensional equilibrium equations, Donnell shell theory is utilized to show that the axially compressive resistance of BNNT varies with applying thermal and electrical loads. The effect of BNNT piezoelectric property on the buckling behavior of the composites is demonstrated. More specifically, it is shown that applying direct and reverse voltages to BNNT changes the buckling loads for any axial and circumferential wavenumbers. Such capability could be uniquely utilized when designing BNNT-reinforced composites.

Using the developed model, specific attention is placed on thermal effects on the microbeams made of aluminum and titanium and the results are compared with each other. Different studies are conducted on the microbeams response characteristics such as frequency response, resonance frequency and heat transition effects while the microbeam tip temperature varies. It is found that Titanium microbeam possesses smaller peak frequency response that occurs at lower frequency. Also, it is demonstrated that increasing the temperature will lower resonance frequency in both beams. Finally, the temperature gradient through the beams with respect to time is studied and it is found that Titanium beam can be stabilized in a longer time period.

J	Lung, Mark A.; Childress, Michael J.								The influence of conspecifics and predation risk on the vigilance of elk (Cervus elaphus) in Yellowstone National Park								BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY				18	1			12	20		10.1093/beheco/ar1066			JAN-FEB 2007	2007	Vigilance in socially foraging animals (e.g., elk) may serve to detect predators (i.e., reduce predation risk) or to monitor the behavior of conspecifics (i.e., reduce conspecific risk and/or increase reproductive benefits). These potential benefits and costs of vigilance may not be equal among different genders and age classes foraging together. We observed male and female elk from 3 age classes (yearlings, nonreproductive, reproductive) during 2 seasons (calving season, breeding season) that vary in social interactions (i.e., conspecific risk) and in 2 regions of Yellowstone National Park that varied in predation risk due to density of wolves. This study was designed to determine the potential functional benefit of vigilance across a range of herd sizes. If vigilance serves to monitor the behavior of conspecifics, we expected it to increase in the fall breeding season along with aggressive behaviors, regardless of changes in predation risk. If vigilance serves to detect predators, we expected it to increase in regions with wolves regardless of changes in conspecific risk. Adult male vigilance and aggression increased during the fall breeding season, but yearling males had significantly lower levels of vigilance. Adult female vigilance increased during the calving season, with increasing predator encounter risk, decreasing herd size, and edge position within the herd. Yearling female vigilance decreased with herd size but was lower than adult females. We conclude that the primary benefit of vigilance for male elk is to monitor conspecifics, but the primary benefit of vigilance for female elk is to detect potential predators.									56	2	0	54	0	57			1045-2249			WOS:000243060000002		
J	Charles, Irudayasamy; Xi, Hongjuan; Arya, Dev P.								Sequence-specific targeting of RNA with an oligonucleotide-neomycin conjugate								BIOCONJUGATE CHEMISTRY				18	1			160	169		10.1021/bc060249r			JAN-FEB 2007	2007	The synthesis of neomycin covalently attached at the C5-position of 2'-deoxyuridine is reported. The synthesis outlined allows for incorporation of an aminoglycoside (neomycin) at any given site in an oligonucleotide (ODN) where a thymidine (or uridine) is present. Incorporation of this modified base into an oligonucleotide, which is complementary to a seven-bases-long alpha-sarcin loop RNA sequence, leads to enhanced duplex hybridization. The increase in T-m for this duplex (Delta T-m = 6 degrees C) suggests a favorable interaction of neomycin within the duplex groove. CD spectroscopy shows that the modified duplex adopts an A-type confirmation. ITC measurements indicate the additive effects of ODN and neomycin binding to the RNA target (K-a = 4.5 x 10(7) M-1). The enhanced stability of the hybrid duplex from this neomycin-ODN conjugate originates primarily from the enthalpic contribution of neomycin {Delta Delta H-obs = -7.21 kcal/mol (Delta H-neomycin conjugated - Delta H (nonconjugated))} binding to the hybrid duplex. The short linker length allows for selective stabilization of the hybrid duplex over the hybrid triplex. The results described here open up new avenues in the design and synthesis of nucleo-aminoglycoside-conjugates (N-Ag-C) where the inclusion of any number of aminoglycoside (neomycin) molecules per oligonucleotide can be accomplished.									30	0	0	22	0	30			1043-1802			WOS:000243503400021	17226969
