These sheets are authored throughout the vehicle life-cycle. Further, various customers use these sheets for training, analyzing the process, and line-balancing. In this research, the primary focus is the time studies analysis that is completed using knowledge contained within the assembly process sheets. In this research, a method and software tool are developed to utilize coupling between part descriptions and process descriptions for assembly time studies. The method is realized through the development of a standardized vocabulary for describing work instructions, a mapping from work instructions to MTM codes, and a tool for extracting relevant part information from CAD models. The approach enables process planners to establish part-process coupling, author work instructions using the controlled vocabulary, to estimate assembly time.

This experimental study focuses on understanding the second issue as it relates to the number of errors considered, the existence of controls, and the level of domain familiarity of the assessor. A set of design failures and associated controls developed for a completed industry sponsored project is used as the experimental design problem. Non-domain individuals (students from an undergraduate psychology class), domain generalists (first year engineering students), and domain-specialists (graduate mechanical engineering students) are provided a set of failure modes and asked to estimate the likelihood that the system would still successfully achieve the stated objectives. Primary results from the study include the following: the confidence level for all domain population decreased significantly as the number of design errors increased (largest p-value=0.0793) and this decrease in confidence is more significant as the design errors increase. The impact on confidence is less when solutions (controls) are provided to prevent the errors (largest p-value=0.0334), the confidence decreased faster for domain general engineers as compared to domain specialists (p=<0.0001). The domain specialists showed higher confidence in making decisions than domain generals and non-domain generalists as the design errors increase.

Essays containing reflections on the history of DTM, supported by an analysis of session titles and papers winning the "best paper award", describe the development of the research themes. A second set of essays describes the evolution of several key research themes. Two broad trends in research themes are evident, with a third one emerging. The topics of the papers in the first decade or so reflect an underlying aim to apply artificial intelligence toward developing systems that could 'design'. To do so required understanding how human designers behave, formalizing design processes so that they could be computed, and formalizing representations of design knowledge. The themes in the first DTM conference and the recollections of the DTM founders reflect this underlying aim. The second decade of DTM saw the emergence of product development as an underlying concern and included a growth in a systems view of design. More recently, there appears to be a trend toward design-led innovation, which entails both executing the design process more efficiently and understanding the characteristics of market-leading designs so as to produce engineered products and systems of exceptional levels of quality and customer satisfaction.

However, with these policies, tenants are not incentivized to use idle bandwidth or prevent link congestion, and may even take advantage of the policies to gain unfair bandwidth allocation. Increasing network utilization while avoiding congestion not only benefits cloud provider but also the tenants by improving application performance. In this paper, we propose a new pricing model that sets different unit prices for reserved bandwidth, the bandwidth on congested links and on uncongested links, and makes the unit price for congested links proportional to their congestion degrees. We use game theory model to analyze tenants' behaviors in our model and the current pricing models, which shows the effectiveness of our model in providing the incentives. With the pricing model, we propose a network sharing policy to achieve both min-guarantee and proportionality, while prevent tenants from earning unfair bandwidth. We further propose methods for each virtual machine to arrange its traffic to maximize its utility. As a result, our solution creates a win-win situation, where tenants strive to increase their benefits in bandwidth sharing, which also concurrently increases the utilities of cloud provider and other tenants. Our simulation and trace-driven experimental results show the effectiveness of our solution in creating the win-win situation.					33rd IEEE Annual Conference on Computer Communications (IEEE INFOCOM)33rd IEEE Annual Conference on Computer Communications (IEEE INFOCOM)	APR 27-MAY 02, 2014APR 27-MAY 02, 2014	IEEEIEEE	Toronto, CANADAToronto, CANADA	5	0	0	0	0	5			0743-166X		978-1-4799-3360-0	WOS:000361544200094

Previous resource provisioning strategies either allocate physical resources to virtual machines (VMs) based on static VM resource demands or dynamically handle the variations in VM resource requirements through live VM migrations. However, the former fail to maximize energy efficiency and resource utilization while the latter produce high migration overhead. To handle these problems, we propose an initial VM allocation mechanism that consolidates complementary VMs with spatial/temporal-awareness. Complementary VMs are the VMs whose total demand of each resource dimension (in the spatial space) nearly reaches their host's capacity during VM lifetime period (in the temporal space). Based on our observation of the existence of VM resource utilization patterns, the mechanism predicts the lifetime resource utilization patterns of short-term VMs or periodical resource utilization patterns of long-term VMs. Based on the predicted patterns, it coordinates the requirements of different resources and consolidates complementary VMs in the same physical machine (PM). This mechanism reduces the number of PMs needed to provide VM service hence increases energy efficiency and resource utilization and also reduces the number of VM migrations and SLA violations. Simulation based on two real traces and real-world testbed experiments show that our initial VM allocation mechanism significantly reduces the number of PMs used, SLA violations and VM migrations of the previous resource provisioning strategies.					33rd IEEE Annual Conference on Computer Communications (IEEE INFOCOM)33rd IEEE Annual Conference on Computer Communications (IEEE INFOCOM)	APR 27-MAY 02, 2014APR 27-MAY 02, 2014	IEEEIEEE	Toronto, CANADAToronto, CANADA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0743-166X		978-1-4799-3360-0	WOS:000361544200116

Previous studies showed that broadcast optimization solutions are sufficient in non-fading environments but may suffer a low delivery ratio under wireless channel fading. Though previous work analyzed the tradeoff between energy and delay in cooperative broadcast, no works investigated the tradeoff in a fading environment. Thus, in this paper, we study this tradeoff with the consideration of fading. We formulate this problem as a Fading-resistant Delay-constrained Minimum Energy Cooperative Broadcast (FDMECB) problem, and prove that it is NP-complete. We then propose an approximation algorithm for theoretical interests. We further propose a heuristic algorithm that makes approximately optimal local decision to achieve global optimization. Our experimental results show that our algorithms outperform a previous non-fading resistant algorithm.					33rd IEEE Annual Conference on Computer Communications (IEEE INFOCOM)33rd IEEE Annual Conference on Computer Communications (IEEE INFOCOM)	APR 27-MAY 02, 2014APR 27-MAY 02, 2014	IEEEIEEE	Toronto, CANADAToronto, CANADA	3	0	0	0	0	3			0743-166X		978-1-4799-3360-0	WOS:000361544200125

First, VMs in clouds use different resources (e.g., CPU, bandwidth, memory) to serve a variety of services (e.g., high performance computing, web services, file services), resulting in different overutilized resources in different PMs. Also, the overutilized resources in a PM may vary over time due to the time-varying heterogenous service requests. Second, there is intensive network communication between VMs. However, previous load balancing methods statically assign equal or pre-defined weights to different resources, which leads to degraded performance in terms of speed and cost to achieve load balance. Also, they do not strive to minimize the VM communications between PMs. We propose a Resource Intensity Aware Load balancing method (RIAL). For each PM, RIAL dynamically assigns different weights to different resources according to their usage intensity in the PM, which significantly reduces the time and cost to achieve load balance and avoids future load imbalance. It also tries to keep frequently communicating VMs in the same PM to reduce bandwidth cost, and migrate VMs to PMs with minimum VM performance degradation. Our extensive trace-driven simulation results and real-world experimental results show the superior performance of RIAL compared to other load balancing methods.					33rd IEEE Annual Conference on Computer Communications (IEEE INFOCOM)33rd IEEE Annual Conference on Computer Communications (IEEE INFOCOM)	APR 27-MAY 02, 2014APR 27-MAY 02, 2014	IEEEIEEE	Toronto, CANADAToronto, CANADA	5	0	0	0	0	5			0743-166X		978-1-4799-3360-0	WOS:000361544200145		
S	Chen, Kang; Shen, Haiying			IEEE					DSearching: Distributed Searching of Mobile Nodes in DTNs with Floating Mobility Information								2014 PROCEEDINGS IEEE INFOCOM		IEEE INFOCOM						2283	2291					2014	2014	In delay tolerant networks (DTNs), enabling a node to search and find an interested mobile node is an important function in many applications. However, the movement of nodes in DTNs makes the problem formidable. Current methods in disconnected networks mainly rely on fixed stations and infrastructure-based communication to collect node position information, which is difficult to implement in DTNs. In this paper, we present DSearching, a distributed mobile node searching scheme for DTNs that requires no infrastructure except the GPS on mobile nodes. In DSearching, the entire DTN area is split into sub-areas, and each node summarizes its mobility information as both transient sub-area visiting record and long-term movement pattern among sub-areas. Each node distributes its transient visiting record for a newly entered sub-area to nodes that are likely to stay in the sub-area that it just moves out, so that the information flows in the network for the locator to trace it along its actual movement path. Each node also stores different parts of its long-term mobility pattern to long-staying nodes in different sub-areas for the locator to trace it when visiting records are absent. Considering that nodes in DTNs usually have limited resources, DSearching constrains the communication and storage cost in the information distribution process. Extensive trace-driven experiments with real traces demonstrate the high efficiency and high effectiveness of DSearching.					33rd IEEE Annual Conference on Computer Communications (IEEE INFOCOM)33rd IEEE Annual Conference on Computer Communications (IEEE INFOCOM)	APR 27-MAY 02, 2014APR 27-MAY 02, 2014	IEEEIEEE	Toronto, CANADAToronto, CANADA	3	1	0	0	0	4			0743-166X		978-1-4799-3360-0	WOS:000361544200255

Key hurdles of electric vehicles (EV) to gain a larger share in the automotive market are the cost of the energy storage system (ESS) and the density of the EV charging infrastructure. The achievable range of an EV or full electric driving of a plugin hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) is limited by its battery capacity. The time to recharge the battery is related to the power level of charging as well as allowable charging parameters to protect the battery life. In order to overcome the constraints of limited range of EVs (all electric driving) as well as the cost of ESS, inductively coupled power transfer (ICPT) is an interesting technology path to be considered, in particular if applied as opportunity (stop-and-go) or in-motion charging (also called dynamic wireless charging or move and charge). Inmotion wireless charging could lead to significant reductions of the vehicle-related cost of electrification but this comes with the price of an infrastructure that needs to be built and maintained. In order to design the ICPT infrastructure and calculate the cost of construction and operation, certain assumptions have to be made with respect to the vehicle specifications, the specification of the charging system itself and the cost of integration into the existing road infrastructure. The objective of this paper is to provide a thorough analysis of the cost associated with the implementation of a dynamic ICPT infrastructure to support the operation of electrified vehicles and to present transportation agencies a business model that can provide a starting point for the development of a new EV infrastructure.

However, some recent tire/wheel technologies often involve lower torsional stiffnesses that cannot be captured well using these rigid wheel assumptions. This paper presents both simulation and experimental analysis of the interaction between a typical ABS controller and tire torsional dynamics. The simulation work includes a comprehensive model that incorporated sidewall flexibility, transient and hysteretic tread-ground friction effects, and the dominant dynamics of a hydraulic braking system. The experimental tests were conducted on a quarter-vehicle ABS test fixture built around a chassis dynamometer. Sensitivity studies are completed through changes in the tire/wheel properties such as wheel inertia, torsional stiffness and ABS controller properties such as the controller's filter. cutoff frequency applied to the wheel speed signals. The results showed strong interactions between the tire's torsional natural frequency and the filter cutoff frequency of the controller.

Engineering designers are constantly pushed to develop new and innovative solutions to design problems yet there has been little research on what actually motivates these designers, both intrinsically and extrinsically, to be innovative. Similarly, engineering students working on their capstone design project are pushed to develop solutions to innovative design problems. The purpose of this paper is to present the initial findings of an innovation survey of Mechanical Engineering students at Clemson University.This paper will discuss the importance of innovation, the current state of innovation, the surveys that were created, the results of said survey, and how this information will be used going forward to improve performance and motivation in capstone design classes. The purpose of this survey is to determine which motivational factors engineering students perceive to be the most effective when working on innovative design projects. The initial results showed that (1) making an "A" grade in the class, (2) developing an "elegant" solution, and (3) making professional contacts with the industry sponsors were the three factors that most effectively promoted innovative design. Conversely, (1) impressing peers, (2) making professional contacts with the fellow students, and (3) winning cash prizes were the three factors that least effectively promoted innovative design.

ASME					EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES ON TRACTION CONCEPTS: ENDURANCE AND OBSTACLE TESTING								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, 2013, VOL 1										V001T01A016				2014	2014	This paper presents experimental endurance results of three undergraduate-designed and built soft soil traction concepts. An experimental approach was chosen due to the limitations of current analytical models of traction on soft soils. The use of analytical models requires detailed understanding of the geometry and mechanics of the tread not readily available. Experimental methods do not require this advanced understanding and provide rapid and realistic results. Building on previous research which showed that the use of high density foam and concave geometry increased the traction performance of a tire in sand, three new concepts are prototyped with a focus on exploring endurance and survivability in aggressive testing. These prototypes employed the use of thinner foam than was previously studied, bed liner, and a combination of Kevlar and bed liner ("Kevliner"). The prototypes were tested in a rotating trough filled with sand where each tread prototype was subjected to distance and acceleration tests with and without a rock obstacle. The damage incurred by the prototype and the percentage of slip between the tire and the trough was recorded during each test to assess the performance of each prototype. Analysis of the slip data collected showed that there was little variation in traction between the three prototypes. This was expected as each concept was based on similar working principles for traction. Therefore, more significance was placed on the physical damage sustained by the prototype to evaluate performance than the slip. The Kevliner prototype proved to be the highest performing prototype. It was the only prototype to complete the entire testing suite. The thin foam and bed liner prototypes both sustained severe damage during an acceleration test with the rock obstacle (the fifth of the six tests). The success of the Kevliner prototype can be attributed to the added strength and durability provided by the Kevlar.

In previous research, complexity of graph-based models has been used to predict market value of products using function models and to predict assembly time from connectivity graphs. This research investigates the potential of applying graphical representations and complexity metrics for exam problem solutions using expert assigned values as an appropriate method to offer point values for new exam questions. The factors and sources of problem difficulty are examined and compared to the structural complexity of a graphical representation of the problem solution. Specifically, this paper presents a protocol for developing the graphical representation. Multiple participants used the protocol to create graphical models of three exam questions to test and validate the usability of the protocol. A secondary protocol was tested to improve the rater agreement for use of the protocol. This protocol will be used for transforming exam problems into graphical models that can be analyzed with the connectivity complexity metrics. These metrics will be used to create predictive models for point assignments based on historical data.

The complexity connectivity method builds predictive models for assembly time based on twenty-nine complexity metrics applied to the product graphs. Previously the part connection graph was manually created, but recently the Assembly Mate Method and the Interference Detection Method have introduced new automated tools for creating the part connectivity graphs. These graph generation methods are compared on their ability to predict the assembly time of multiple products. For this research, eleven consumers products are used to train an artificial neural network and three products are reserved for testing. The results indicate that both the Assembly Mate Method and the Interference Detection Method can create connectivity graphs that predict the assembly time of a product to within 45% of the target time. The Interference Detection Method showed less variability than the Assembly Mate Method in the time estimations. The Assembly Mate Method is limited to only Solid Works assembly files, while the Interference Detection Method is more flexible and can operate on different file formats including TUBS, STEP, and Parasolid. Overall, both of the graph generation methods provide a suitable automated tool to form the connectivity graph, but the Interference Detection Method provides less variance in predicting the assembly time and is more flexible in terms of file types that can be used.

Axiomatic Design has been used in various fields such as software system design, structure design, and product design. However, several challenges and limitations exist in Axiomatic Design including: the inconsistency in identifying design parameters, existence of coupled design, and multiple groups of functional requirements and design parameters. Aimed at using Axiomatic Design to generate conceptual solutions in engineering design while overcoming its limitations, a formal ontology is developed. The ontology defines functional requirements, design parameters, concepts, components and variables and their relationships. Axioms and rules of Axiomatic Design for the ontology are summarized. The Axiomatic Design ontology is applied to the design of a car seat as an example generating several concepts, and then compared and analyzed multiple groups of the concepts with the help of Axiomatic Design rules. More design ideas can be generated by combining detailed concepts as the higher level possible solutions.

This field investigation has also served to validate laboratory investigaticins into high density air cooling issues. In data centers with significant power consumption, and consequently high cooling loads per rack, high volumes of room airflow are required to Meet server cooling airflow requirements. These volumes of air can be difficult to deliver in raised floor hot aisle / cold aisle layouts. The velocity of the airflow is such that it creates a negative pressure near the bottom of the rack. This negative pressure entrains air from under and behind the rack, causing recirculation and warmer air being provided to the servers at the base of the rack. This can cause operational problems and server performance impacts. This phenomenon has been demonstrated in previous papers reporting on test data using particle imaging velocimetry (PIV) techniques. The current work validates those studies by looking at airflow, infrared thermography, and actual IT performance while the under rack recirculation flows are occurring. Additionally, we demonstrate significant improvement by employing rigorous airflow management practices. We also discuss the limitations of current CFD modeling, the majority of which does not have sufficient grid-wise resolution to capture the problem. Further we discuss typical operational conditions that have suppressed the problem (or perhaps the awareness of) to date. Finally, the paper recommends best practices to mitigate the problem in high density data centers.

Approximately one-third of the gasoline or diesel fuel energy passes through the engine's exhaust system as heat. With ongoing developments in thermoelectric materials and module design, thermoelectric power generation has a potential use in engine heat recovery. In this study, the capability of generating usable power by thermoelectric generation from the exhaust heat of a three-cylinder, 697 cubic centimeter diesel engine was investigated. From experimental testing, the maximum power output and maximum current for a single module and four modules connected in series was 0.49W with 0.437A, and 2.81W with 0.60A, respectively. To harvest larger power magnitude from the waste heat, the modules will be configured in a co-axial manner along the pipe. Other possible applications include stationary power generation systems in which added weight does not effect overall performance.

Electrochemical models are arguably more accurate in capturing physical phenomena inside the cells compared to their data-driven or equivalent circuit based counterparts. Moreover, consideration of the coupling between electrochemical and thermal dynamics can be potentially beneficial for accurate estimation. In this paper, a nonlinear adaptive observer design is presented based on a coupled electrochemical-thermal model for a Li-ion cell. The proposed adaptive observer estimates distributed Li-ion concentrations, lumped temperature and some electrochemical parameters simultaneously. The observer design is split into two separate parts to simplify the design procedure and gain tuning. These separate parts are designed based on Lyapunov's stability analysis guaranteeing the convergence of the combined state-parameter estimates. Simulation studies are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the scheme.

ASME					AN ELECTRICAL MICROGRID - INTEGRATION OF SOLAR PANELS, COMPRESSED AIR STORAGE, AND A MICRO-CAP GAS TURBINE								7TH ANNUAL DYNAMIC SYSTEMS AND CONTROL CONFERENCE, 2014, VOL 2										V002T22A003				2014	2014	Non-renewable energy sources such as coal, oil, and natural gas are being consumed at a brisk pace while greenhouse gases contribute to atmospheric pollution. A global shift is underway toward the inclusion of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, for generating electrical and mechanical power. To meet this emerging demand, a solar based electrical microgrid study is underway at Clemson University. Solar energy is harvested from photovoltaic panels capable of producing 15 kW of DC power. Compressed air energy storage has been evaluated using the generated solar power to operate an electric motor driven piston compressor. The compressed air is then stored under pressure and supplied to a natural gas driven Capstone C30 MicroTurbine with attached electric power generator. The compressed air facilitates the turbine's rotor-blade operated compression stage resulting in direct energy savings. A series of mathematical models have been developed. To evaluate the feasibility and energy efficiency improvements, the experimental and simulation results indicated that 127.8 watts of peak power was delivered at 17.5 Volts and 7.3 Amps from each solar panel. The average power generation over a 24-hour time period from 115 panels was 15 kW DC or 6 kW of AC power at 208/240 VAC and 25 Amps from the inverter. This electrical power could run a 5.2 kW reciprocating compressor for approximately 5 hours storing 1,108 kg of air at a 1.2 pressure. A case study indicated that the microturbine, when operated witMPa hout compressed air storage, consumed 11.2 kg of gaseous propane for 30 kW.hr of energy generation. In contrast, the microturbine operated in conjunction with solar supplied air storage could generate 50.8 kW.hr of electrical energy for a similar amount of fuel consumption. The study indicated an 8.1% efficiency improvement in energy generated by the system which utilized compressed air energy storage over the traditional approach.

B	Tao, Xinran (William); Wagner, John			ASME					COOLING AIR TEMPERATURE AND MASS FLOW RATE CONTROL FOR HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLE BATTERY THERMAL MANAGEMENT								7TH ANNUAL DYNAMIC SYSTEMS AND CONTROL CONFERENCE, 2014, VOL 2										V002T34A002				2014	2014	Lithium-Ion (Li-ion) batteries are widely used in electric and hybrid electric vehicles for energy storage. However, a Li-ion battery's lifespan and performance is reduced if it's overheated during operation. To maintain the battery's temperature below established thresholds, the heat generated during charge/discharge must be removed and this requires an effective cooling system. This paper introduces a battery thermal management system (BTMS) based on a dynamic thermal-electric model of a cylindrical battery. The heat generation rate estimated by this model helps to actively control the air mass flow rate. A nonlinear back-stepping controller and a linear optimal controller are developed to identify the ideal cooling air temperature which stabilizes the battery core temperature. The simulation of two different operating scenarios and three control strategies has been conducted. Simulation results indicate that the proposed controllers can stabilize the battery core temperature with peak tracking errors smaller than 2.4 degrees C by regulating the cooling air temperature and mass flow rate. Overall the controllers developed for the battery thermal management system show improvements in both temperature tracking and cooling system power conservation, in comparison to the classical controller. The next step in this study is to integrate these elements into a holistic cooling configuration with AC system compressor control to minimize the cooling power consumption.

It then proposes a two-step observer design scheme involving the estimation of distributed temperature from boundary sensing cascaded with nonlinear cure state observers. For the temperature observer, backstepping techniques are applied to derive the observer partial differential equations along with the gain kernels. For subsequent cure state estimation, a nonlinear observer is derived along with analysis of its convergence characteristics. While illustrative simulation results are included for a composite laminate curing application, it is apparent that the approach can also be adopted for other UV processing applications in advanced manufacturing.

This hazardous practice, called tailgating, accounted for over 40% of the 110,000 trailer-passenger vehicle crashes recorded by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in 2010. Tailgating is difficult to detect and document using visual methods and law enforcement agencies must depend on trained officers, whose abilities may be limited. In this paper, a proposed tailgating detection system, mounted to the officer's patrol vehicle, continuously monitors both passenger and commercial vehicles, as the officer travels down the roadway. A rotating laser range-finding sensor feeds information to a microprocessor that continuously searches for the occurrence of tailgating. A weighting algorithm determines when a tailgating event has definitively occurred to reduce system sensitivity. If an event is detected, the officer is notified with audio and visual cues. A time stamped record including all relevant system information for later use in legal prosecution is also produced. In a virtual case study, the computer generated roadway environment was populated with vehicles of varying velocity and location. The numerical results show that the detection algorithm was able to successfully locate all of the virtual vehicles and accurately determine tailgating events under a number of different simulation conditions.

A model reduction is needed because of a high frequency dynamic associated with the input shaft of the gearbox which prevents the model from being executed in real-time. This particular gearbox has an atypical input stage configuration whereby the load path is split into two parallel shafts before being recombined at the sun shaft. The strategy includes removing model elements associated with high frequency vibration, merging model elements, and locating model elements where needed. The presented strategy successfully removes the problematic eigenvalues, maintains basic dynamic character, and results in a multibody gearbox model suitable for real-time simulation.

Using a combination of torsionally flexible tire-wheel model and a dynamic tire-ground friction model, it is highlighted that the primary cause of unstable oscillations is the 'Stribeck' effect in tire-ground friction. It is also shown analytically that when suspension torsional compliances are negligible, the bifurcation parameters for the local torsional instability include forward speed, normal load and tire radius. In the presence of significant suspension torsional compliance, it is shown that the stability is also affected by suspension torsional stiffness and damping. Furthermore, the tire torsional stiffness becomes an important bifurcation parameter only in the presence of significant suspension compliance. This analysis gives useful insights for the selection of tire sidewall stiffness ranges and their proper matching with targeted vehicle suspensions at the design stage.

An assembly line is a flow-oriented production system where the productive units performing the operations, referred to as stations, are aligned in a serial manner. The work pieces visit stations successively as they are moved along the line usually by some kind of transportation system, e.g., a conveyor belt. An important decision problem, called Assembly Line Balancing Problem (ALBP), arises and has to be solved when (re-) configuring an assembly line. It consists of distributing the work tasks among the work stations along the line due to changes in task requirements for planned production. The assignment of tasks to stations is constrained by task sequence restrictions which can be expressed in a precedence graph. However, most manufacturers usually do not have precedence graphs or if they do, the information on their precedence graphs is inadequate. As a consequence, the elaborate solution procedures for different versions of ALBP developed by more than 50 years of research are often not applicable in practice as not all constraint information is known. This is a common problem in automotive final assembly. In this work we describe a novel precedence generation technique that is based on system-learning from past feasible production sequences. This technique forms a sufficient precedence graph that guarantees feasible line balances. Experiments indicate that the proposed procedure is able to approximate a precedence graph generated by an expert sufficiently well to detect nearly-optimal solutions even for a real-world automotive assembly line segment. Thus, the application of system learning seems to provide a simple and practical way to implement Decision Support Systems to make assembly line planning more efficient.					9th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC2014)9th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC2014)	JUN 09-13, 2014JUN 09-13, 2014	ASME, Mfg Engn DivASME, Mfg Engn Div	Univ Michigan, Detroit, MIUniv Michigan, Detroit, MI	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-4580-6	WOS:000361249700040

Prior researchers have investigated the effects of cutting parameters on tool wear and as a result, tool life has seen significant improvement. However, these studies are not concerned with tool flank wear during machining; they instead focus on tool flank wear after a certain amount of cutting distance. This study proposes a new method of predicting tool flank wear during machining that has the capability of suggesting tool failure without directly measuring the tool. For this purpose, a detailed set of experiments on end milling of titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V was conducted and analyzed. Then, the resultant force output, which can be monitored during machining, was used to establish a predictive algorithm for tool flank wear. Using the increase in the resultant force as well as the total energy spent on the workpiece, it was shown that tool flank wear can be effectively predicted during machining and this can decrease the time spent on tool failure inspection and early tool change, increasing the throughput of the process.					9th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC2014)9th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC2014)	JUN 09-13, 2014JUN 09-13, 2014	ASME, Mfg Engn DivASME, Mfg Engn Div	Univ Michigan, Detroit, MIUniv Michigan, Detroit, MI	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-4580-6	WOS:000361249700079

However, these superior properties as well as its low thermal conductivity and chemical reactivity make it a challenge to machine Ti-6Al-4V at optimal conditions. In order to overcome this challenge, researchers constantly develop new tools and new techniques, but the extent of machining rates that can be used efficiently with those tools and techniques are usually not clear. Considering only one variable in the process and optimizing according to that variable is not sufficient because of the interactions between parameters. Also, selecting one objective function from a pool of many is not beneficial since those objectives are in conflict with one another. Therefore, this study proposes the use of a combined optimization algorithm in order to account for three major variables in end milling of Ti-6Al-4V: cutting speed, feed, and depth of cut. These variables are optimized for multiple objectives. Although it is possible to optimize the process for many different objectives, some of them are heavily correlated to each other, hence two objectives representing machinability and efficiency are selected: tool flank wear and material removal rate. The study aims to establish an optimal Pareto front of machining parameters that would optimize the conflicting outputs of the process, utilizing the multi-objective particle swarm optimization technique.					9th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC2014)9th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC2014)	JUN 09-13, 2014JUN 09-13, 2014	ASME, Mfg Engn DivASME, Mfg Engn Div	Univ Michigan, Detroit, MIUniv Michigan, Detroit, MI	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-4580-6	WOS:000361249700080

In a preliminary work, the concept was applied to the back extrusion process, in what was referred to as "friction stir back extrusion" or FSBE; it was shown that the concept is practically valid and FSBE is capable of producing lightweight tubular specimens. Nevertheless, the FSBE process was claimed to have several merits over conventional processes, mainly: (i) unique process capabilities and energy efficiency (ii) significant grain refinement, and thus (iii) favorable mechanical properties in the formed tubes. None of these claims were adequately addressed nor quantified in earlier work. Therefore, this work presents a comprehensive study that aims to reveal the true merits of FSBE, validate the claims, and quantify its effects on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the deformed material. The outcomes of the study are presented in three major parts, each addressing one of the abovementioned claims. Force, torque and power measurements during FSBE experiments are used to address the first claim. Detailed optical microscopy and electron back scatter diffraction work is carried out in the second part to quantify the changes to the grain structure and texture of the material.

They play a crucial role in elevated temperature applications where high strength, high resistance to corrosion and creep resistance are required. Machinability suffers as a result of these properties and harsh machining conditions occur, resulting in high cutting forces and tool wear. To combat the difficulties in the machining of nickel-based superalloys, such as poor thermal diffusivity and high levels of abrasive wear, trochoidal milling was introduced as an alternative method of milling. This method of milling combines linear motion with uniform circular motion, reducing chip load in exchange for increased machining time. Industry is averse to its widespread adoption due to increasing cycle times when compared to conventional milling methods, however it has been shown that overall productivity can be improved due to less tool wear with a more predictable behavior. This work characterizes the effects of trochoidal milling and provides a comparison of trochoidal milling with a traditional milling technique, end milling, for the machining of Inconel 738. In order to compare the trochoidal and conventional machining approaches directly, metrics of productivity normalized to tool wear are introduced. The normalized metrics introduced in this study aim to provide a more representative comparison of productivity and efficiency characteristics: volumetric material removal per unit tool wear (MR/VB) and the material removal rate per unit tool wear (MRR/VB). It was found that significantly higher volumetric material removal is possible using trochoidal milling, and fewer tools are needed; material removal rates that competitive with end milling can be achieved. When the amount of time spent on tool change for the same volume of material removal is considered, material removal rate of trochoidal milling can even be higher than end milling, indicating that better productivity and efficiency of the process is possible at reduced tooling costs.					9th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC2014)9th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC2014)	JUN 09-13, 2014JUN 09-13, 2014	ASME, Mfg Engn DivASME, Mfg Engn Div	Univ Michigan, Detroit, MIUniv Michigan, Detroit, MI	2	0	0	0	0	2					978-0-7918-4581-3	WOS:000361249800058

IEEE					FlashTrack: A Fast, In-network Tracking System for Sensor Networks								2014 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING IN SENSOR SYSTEMS (IEEE DCOSS 2014)		IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems						51	58		10.1109/DCOSS.2014.24			2014	2014	We revisit the classic object tracking problem with a novel and effective, yet straightforward distributed solution for resource-lean devices. The difficulty of object tracking lies in the mismatch between the limited computational capacity of typical sensor nodes and the processing requirements of typical tracking algorithms. In this paper, we introduce an in-network system for tracking mobile objects using resource-lean sensors. The system is based on a distributed, dynamically-scoped tracking algorithm which alters the event detection region and reporting rate based on object speed. A leader node records the detected samples across the event region and estimates the object's location in situ. We study the performance of our tracking implementation on an 80-node testbed. The results show that it achieves high performance, even for very fast objects, and is readily implemented on resource-lean sensors. While the area is well-studied, the unique combination of algorithmic features represents a significant addition to the literature.					9th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems (DCOSS)9th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems (DCOSS)	MAY 26-28, 2014MAY 26-28, 2014	IEEE; IEEE Comp Soc; Assoc Comp MachineryIEEE; IEEE Comp Soc; Assoc Comp Machinery	Marina Del Rey, CAMarina Del Rey, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0			2325-2936		978-1-4799-4618-1	WOS:000361020100008

Modeling the residual stress profile is currently tedious and inaccurate. This study introduces a new method of understanding the residual stress profile in terms of quantifiable key measures: peak tensile stress at the surface, magnitude and depth of peak compressive stress, and depth at which residual stress becomes near-zero. Experiments in turning IN-100 and milling GTD-111 have been conducted and subsequent X-ray Diffraction measurements have been utilized to obtain residual stress profiles. Using a sinusoidal decay function fitted to measured residual stress profiles, these four key profile measures are extracted and then the effects of process parameters such as cutting speed, feed, cutting edge radius, and tool coating on these measures are investigated.

Composites also play a critical role in the aerospace and automotive industries. They are the very things that protect us from harsh environments. Due to widespread usage, it is important to understand how these materials age and perform over time. The advantages of polymeric composites are high rigidity, high strength to weight ratio, corrosion resistance, high fatigue strength, low thermal expansion, and manufacturability. The advantages of polymeric composite parts in machines and vehicles are low mass, high speed of operation, excellent fatigue resistance, quiet running due to shock absorption, easy installment and demounting, low maintenance cost, low energy costs during production and life cycle. Despite the advantages, there are concerns regarding the long-term durability of these composites especially when it comes to performances under critical and varying conditions. Since Terfenol-D, a magnetostrictive material will be placed in these polymeric composites for structural health monitoring, it is imperative to understand the microstructure of the particles and their net effect on the resin, e.g. distortions, volume fraction, and induced strain. Terfenol-D (Tb1-xDyxFe2) is of the cubic laves phase structure in which there is less plastic deformation which in turn makes the particles hard and brittle.					7th Annual ASME Conference on Smart Materials, Adaptive Structures and Intelligent Systems (SMASIS)7th Annual ASME Conference on Smart Materials, Adaptive Structures and Intelligent Systems (SMASIS)	SEP 08-10, 2014SEP 08-10, 2014	ASME, Aerospace DivASME, Aerospace Div	Newport, RINewport, RI	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-4614-8	WOS:000360948000093

The device which is mounted on a vibrating structure, consists of a rectangular container carrying a magnetized ferrofluid and a pick-up coil wound around the container to enable energy harvesting. Experiments are performed to investigate the three-way interaction between the vibrations of the structure, the sloshing of the fluid, and the harvesting circuit dynamics. In particular, the tuning and optimization is examined for several design parameters including magnetic field spatial distribution and intensity, winding direction, winding location, winding density, and ferrofluid height inside the tank. The experimental response of the device is compared against the conventional TMFD at different excitation levels and frequencies. Results demonstrating the influence of the significant parameters on the relative performance are presented and discussed in terms of vibration suppression and power generation capabilities.					7th Annual ASME Conference on Smart Materials, Adaptive Structures and Intelligent Systems (SMASIS)7th Annual ASME Conference on Smart Materials, Adaptive Structures and Intelligent Systems (SMASIS)	SEP 08-10, 2014SEP 08-10, 2014	ASME, Aerospace DivASME, Aerospace Div	Newport, RINewport, RI	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-4615-5	WOS:000360949200073

To achieve this goal, a flow energy harvester consisting of a piezoelectric cantilever beam augmented with a square-sectioned bluff body at the free end is considered. Two magnets located near the tip of the bluff body are used to introduce the nonlinearity which strength and nature can be altered by changing the distance between the magnets. A lumped-parameter aero-electromechanical model adopting the quasi-steady assumption for aerodynamic loading is presented and utilized to numerically simulate the harvester's response. Wind tunnel tests are also performed to validate the numerical simulations by conducting upward and downward wind velocity sweeps. Results comparing the relative performance of several harvesters with potential functions of different shapes demonstrate that a mono-stable potential function with a hardening restoring force can outperform all other configurations.					7th Annual ASME Conference on Smart Materials, Adaptive Structures and Intelligent Systems (SMASIS)7th Annual ASME Conference on Smart Materials, Adaptive Structures and Intelligent Systems (SMASIS)	SEP 08-10, 2014SEP 08-10, 2014	ASME, Aerospace DivASME, Aerospace Div	Newport, RINewport, RI	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-4615-5	WOS:000360949200071

ASME					NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE PERFORMANCE AND OPTIMIZATION OF GALLOPING FLOW ENERGY HARVESTERS								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME CONFERENCE ON SMART MATERIALS ADAPTIVE STRUCTURES AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS, 2014, VOL 2										V002T07A007				2014	2014	This paper presents a generalized formulation, analysis, and optimization of energy harvesters subjected to galloping and base excitations. The harvester consists of a cantilever beam with a bluff body attached at the free end. A nondimensional lumped-parameter model which accounts for the combined loading and different electro-mechanical transduction mechanisms is presented. The aerodynamic loading is modeled using the quasisteady assumption with polynomial approximation. A nonlinear analysis is carried out and an approximate analytical solution is obtained. A dimensional analysis is performed to identify the important parameters that affect the system's response. It is shown that the response curves of the harvester can be generated in terms of only three dimensionless loading parameters. These curves can serve as a complete design guide for scaling and optimizing the performance of galloping-based harvesters. As a special case study, a harvester subjected to only galloping excitations is analyzed. It is shown that, for a given shape of the bluff body and under quasi-steady flow conditions, the harvester's dimensionless response can be described by a single universal curve irrespective to the geometric, mechanical, and electrical design parameters of the harvester. The universal curve is utilized to obtain the optimal harvesting circuit design parameters, that minimize the cut-in wind speed and maximize the output power, and predict the harvester's total conversion efficiency.

Experimental data was collected in a single cylinder, gasoline-fueled, HCCI engine in order to determine the effects of combustion chamber geometry and wall conditions on thermal stratification and HCCI combustion. The study includes a wall temperature sweep and variations of piston top surface material, piston top geometry, and compression ratio. The data is processed with a traditional heat release routine, as well as a post-processing tool termed the Thermal Stratification Analysis, which calculates an unburned temperature distribution from heat release. For all of the sweeps, the 50% burned point was kept constant by varying the intake temperature. Keeping the combustion phasing constant ensures the separation of the effects of combustion phasing from the effects of wall conditions alone on HCCI and thermal stratification. The results for the wall temperature sweep show no changes to the burn characteristics once the combustion phasing has been matched with intake temperature. This result suggests that the effects of wall temperature on HCCI are mostly during the gas-exchange portion of the cycle. The ceramic coatings were able to very slightly decrease the thermal width, increase the burn rate, increase the combustion efficiency, and decrease the cumulative heat loss. The combustion efficiency increased with the lower surface area to volume ratio piston and the lower compression ratio. Lastly, the compression ratio comparison showed a noticeable effect on the temperature distribution due to the effect of pressure on ignition delay, and the variation of TDC temperature required to match combustion phasing.

In the proposed model, the leadership style of the superior, specifically consideration, is linked to subordinate participation in the budgeting process. Both leadership style and budget participation, in turn, influence employee beliefs about budgetary fairness, that is, beliefs concerning the procedural and distributive justice of the budgeting system. Finally, the justice of the budgeting system and its antecedents (leadership and budget participation) affect organizational commitment.

Although Pinsker, Pennington, and Schafer (2009) implicitly treat advocacy and professional skepticism as opposing constructs, the purpose of this research note is to explicitly examine whether an accounting professional can be both a professional skeptic and a client advocate. Two hundred and six experienced accounting professionals with a mixture of accounting and tax backgrounds responded to a client advocacy scale (Pinsker et al., 2009) and a professional skepticism scale (Hurtt, 2010). Results indicate that while tax professionals have higher levels of client advocacy than auditors, both groups have similar levels of professional skepticism. Moreover, no correlation emerges between participants' responses to the advocacy and the full professional skepticism scale or five of its six subscales. These results provide evidence that client advocacy is a separate and distinct construct from professional skepticism. These findings have implications for behavioral accounting researchers by demonstrating that these two constructs are not related; thus, it is important to separately measure client advocacy and professional skepticism when they are relevant to a research question.									1	0	0	0	0	1					978-1-78350-446-6; 978-1-78350-445-9	WOS:000358001400006

This study investigates factors that encourage subordinates to share this information with their superiors during the budgeting process. According to the proposed theory, the fairness of the budgeting system, specifically its procedural justice, influences the degree of information sharing. If the subordinate believes that budgeting procedures are fair, the subordinate is more likely to disclose private information during the budgeting process.Design/methodology/approach We conduct an anonymous survey of supervisors and managers in four companies. Regression model is developed with information sharing as the dependent variable. Independent variables include procedural justice of budgeting system and also budget participation and organizational commitment, variables that prior studies have identified as important in information sharing.Findings - Results support the proposed model in general. The three independent variables (procedural justice, budget participation, commitment) interact in their effect on information sharing.Research limitations/implications - Results suggest that companies that seek the private information of subordinates should consider the fairness of the budgeting system. Fair procedures encourage information exchange.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1474-7871		978-1-78350-631-6; 978-1-78350-632-3	WOS:000357991300005

Within the past decade and a half, although much remains to be investigated, substantial progress has been made in breaking the surface of this research. The current volume provides a review of MTS case studies and the current chapter provides a synopsis of this research. The goal of this chapter is to identify how MTSs are operating under real-world conditions in order to bridge MTS science and practice.Design/methodology/approach - In this chapter, the authors provide a case analysis of the presented MTSs in the current volume in order to identify issues innate to MTSs. An approach based on the SWOT analysis technique was utilized to identify strengths, weaknesses, threats, and opportunities of the identified MTSs. In addition, six lessons learned were extracted from a content analysis of the successes and failures of these MTSs.Findings - Although MTSs may be unique to the environment in which they operate, there are several features which seem to be inherent to all. Strengths include possessing the ability to manage complex tasks and unexpected events, being flexible in nature, and integrating communication across levels. In opposition, weaknesses include the use of nontraditional communication patterns, challenges stemming from unit diversity and resources, and the lack of common training. Lessons learned from identified MTSs include (1) utilize effective communication; (2) establish shared mental models; (3) identify roles and responsibilities; (4) convey accountability and ownership; (5) consider the ramp-up period; and (6) train individuals in an MTS at multiple levels. Opportunities and threats to MTSs are also discussed in this chapter.Originality/value - This chapter offers several contributions to the state of the field in regard to MTSs. The current chapter provides a detailed content analysis of several real-world MTSs. Characteristics inherent to MTSs are identified and discussed, and lessons learned are extracted. Traditionally, science and practice has focused on the presentation of lab-based MTSs; the current volume breaks new ground by identifying how MTSs operate "in the wild." This chapter provides a summation of this volume and offers lessons learned for MTS researchers and those working within MTSs.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1534-0856		978-1-78350-314-8; 978-1-78350-313-1	WOS:000358000800012

Half of the articles addressed the links between victimization and delinquency among Caribbean youth but the majority was primarily descriptive.Research limitations/implications - Only peer-reviewed journals were included, so unpublished country and organizational reports were not covered in the review.Practical implications - More current and longitudinal studies are needed, which examine the connections between delinquency and victimization, and the experiences in the smaller or less developed Caribbean countries.Social implications - The review provides directions for the enhancement of positive youth development policy and practice.Originality/value - This paper fills the gap in the understanding of the research on delinquency and victimization among Caribbean youth. The ecological framework also adds value to the understanding of the topic by highlighting the importance of various social contexts, such as the family, school, and neighborhood, on youth development in the Caribbean.									0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-78441-059-9; 978-1-78441-060-5	WOS:000358065700011		
S	Han, Wonkyu; Hu, Hongxin; Ahn, Gail-Joon						Atluri, V; Pernul, G		LPM: Layered Policy Management for Software-Defined Networks								DATA AND APPLICATIONS SECURITY AND PRIVACY XXVIII		Lecture Notes in Computer Science		8566				356	363					2014	2014	Software-Defined Networking (SDN) as an emerging paradigm in networking divides the network architecture into three distinct layers such as application, control, and data layers. The multi-layered network architecture in SDN tremendously helps manage and control network traffic flows but each layer heavily relies on complex network policies. Managing and enforcing these network policies require dedicated cautions since combining multiple network modules in an SDN application not only becomes a non-trivial job, but also requires considerable efforts to identify dependencies within a module and between modules. In addition, multi-tenant SDN applications make network management tasks more difficult since there may exist unexpected interferences between traffic flows. In order to accommodate such complex network dynamics in SDN, we propose a novel policy management framework for SDN, called layered policy management (LPM). We also articulate challenges for each layer in terms of policy management and describe appropriate resolution strategies. In addition, we present a proof-of-concept implementation and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach with an SDN-based simulated network.					28th Annual IFIP WG 11.3 Working Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy (DBSEC)28th Annual IFIP WG 11.3 Working Conference on Data and Applications Security and Privacy (DBSEC)	JUL 14-16, 2014JUL 14-16, 2014	IFIP WG 11 3IFIP WG 11 3	Vienna, AUSTRIAVienna, AUSTRIA	4	1	0	0	0	5			0302-9743		978-3-662-43936-4; 978-3-662-43935-7	WOS:000360152700023

For several years the fluids used were mostly Newtonian with low viscosity but there is nowadays a tendency to use more complex fluids. Some recent applications are encountered in the pharmaceutical industry where there is a need of producing on-demand identical droplets of a given size that can be used for drug delivery and in bioengineering where droplets have to contain cells used for tissue manufacturing or organ printing. The objective of the paper is to show that scale analysis is an efficient tool to classify the physical phenomena contributing to the breakup of a jet or of a liquid filament of a complex fluid and to provide guidelines for controlling the droplet formation process.

One method for assessing concourse performance is to set and attempt to meet an appropriate level of service (LOS) for airport passengers based on congestion. A simulation model is developed to estimate the occupancy of zones within a concourse. A finger-pier concourse with 12 gates along its perimeter and four sets of moving walkways is considered as an example to estimate passenger occupancy in each zone and the resulting percent of time a day the concourse attains LOS B. This research provides insight into how various concourse operation strategies affect when and how passenger congestion forms within the terminal.					10th International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing (IIH-MSP)10th International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing (IIH-MSP)	AUG 27-29, 2014AUG 27-29, 2014	IEEE Comp Soc; IEEE; Natl Kaohsiung Univ Appl Sci; IEEE Tainan Sect; IEEE Signal Proc Soc, Tainan Chapter; Int Soc Management Engineers; JSPS NSFC NRF A3 Foresight Program Ultra Realist Acoust Interact Commun Next Generat InternetIEEE Comp Soc; IEEE; Natl Kaohsiung Univ Appl Sci; IEEE Tainan Sect; IEEE Signal Proc Soc, Tainan Chapter; Int Soc Management Engineers; JSPS NSFC NRF A3 Foresight Program Ultra Realist Acoust Interact Commun Next Generat Internet	Waseda Univ, Kitakyushu, JAPANWaseda Univ, Kitakyushu, JAPAN	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4799-5390-5	WOS:000358743800026

Persson, PO; Staten, ML		Adaptive and Unstructured Mesh Cleaving								23RD INTERNATIONAL MESHING ROUNDTABLE (IMR23)		Procedia Engineering		82				266	278		10.1016/j.proeng.2014.10.389			2014	2014	We propose a new strategy for boundary conforming meshing that decouples the problem of building tetrahedra of proper size and shape from the problem of conforming to complex, non-manifold boundaries. This approach is motivated by the observation that while several methods exist for adaptive tetrahedral meshing, they typically have difficulty at geometric boundaries. The proposed strategy avoids this conflict by extracting the boundary conforming constraint into a secondary step. We first build a background mesh having a desired set of tetrahedral properties, and then use a generalized stenciling method to divide, or "cleave", these elements to get a set of conforming tetrahedra, while limiting the impacts cleaving has on element quality. In developing this new framework, we make several technical contributions including a new method for building graded tetrahedral meshes as well as a generalization of the isosurface stuffing and lattice cleaving algorithms to unstructured background meshes.

They exemplify a system class known as reactive systems, which comprise execution units that have "hidden" layers of control flow. A key obstacle in enabling reactive system developers to rigorously validate their implementations has been the absence of precise software component specifications and tools to assist in leveraging those specifications at runtime. We address this obstacle in three ways: (i) We describe a specification approach tailored for reactive environments and demonstrate its application in the context of sensornets. (ii) We describe the design and implementation of extensions to the popular nesC tool-chain that enable the expression of these specifications and automate the generation of runtime monitors that signal violations, if any. (iii) Finally, we apply the specification approach to a significant collection of the most commonly used software components in the TinyOS distribution and analyze the overhead involved in monitoring their correctness.					5th International Conference on Runtime Verification (RV)5th International Conference on Runtime Verification (RV)	SEP 22-25, 2014SEP 22-25, 2014		Univ Toronto, Fields Inst Res Math Sci, Toronto, CANADAUniv Toronto, Fields Inst Res Math Sci, Toronto, CANADA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0302-9743		978-3-319-11164-3; 978-3-319-11163-6	WOS:000358524900010

We use a public data feed from transit buses in the City of San Francisco as an example data source. Sparsity of time and location updates along with frequent stops, at bus stops and traffic lights, complicates estimation of travel time for each link based on a single bus pass. Unlike most previous papers that focus on estimation of link travel times, we divide each link into shorter segments, and propose two iterative methods for allocating travel time statistics to each segment. Inspired by K-means and Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithms, we iteratively update the mean and variance of travel time for each segment based on historical probe data. Our preliminary results show convergence to reasonable travel time patterns; for instance they clearly reveal the location of bus stops and traffic signals and statistics of delay across them. Applications of this work are in better traveler information systems and in estimation of maximum likelihood trajectory of vehicles in arterial roads.

In this study, two trials were established with 'Redhaven' on 9 (planted 2006) and 18 (planted 2009) rootstock cultivars at the Musser Fruit Research Center, Seneca, South Carolina. A stem water potential (SWp) curve was developed with a Scholander pressure bomb on a single day similar to 6 weeks after harvest (August, 2011) with hourly evaluations between 5 am and 8 pm on a 'Redhaven'/Lovell tree. For each trial, SWp readings were done before dawn and in the afternoon (similar to 4 pm). The maximum negative SWp occurred at similar to 4 pm. Carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and ash content analyses were done on 1-year-old shoots at the beginning of dormancy in November, 2011. Rootstocks influenced all variables studied in both trials. Trees that were more stressed (high negative SWp) before dawn were also more stressed in the afternoon (i.e., rootstocks Prunus munsoniana and Empyrean (R) 3). A similar pattern was observed for those trees/rootstocks with less negative SWp (i.e, Prunus americana, Fortuna and KV010127) in the predawn hours as they also remained less negative in the afternoon. There was no correlation between SWp and C, N, C/N ratio or shoot ash content. There were negative correlations between C/N ratio and ash content and the N and C/N ratio. There was a positive correlation between N and ash content. These data suggested that SWp was not a reliable method to predict C, N or ash content accumulation in 1-year-old peach shoots from trees grown on many different rootstock genotypes.					10th International Symposium on Integrating Canopy, Rootstock and Environmental Physiology in Orchard Systems10th International Symposium on Integrating Canopy, Rootstock and Environmental Physiology in Orchard Systems	DEC 03-06, 2012DEC 03-06, 2012	Int Soc Hort SciInt Soc Hort Sci	Stellenbosch, SOUTH AFRICAStellenbosch, SOUTH AFRICA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-94-62610-48-4	WOS:000358040500044		
S	Reighard, G.

However, compatibility, growth, and yield of these new rootstocks have yet to be assessed with many peach cultivars. 'Redhaven' peach was grafted to 24 rootstocks represented in 2 replicated trials near Clemson, South Carolina. These trials were planted in 2005 and 2009 on a Cecil gravelly, sandy loam with a pH of 5.0 (no pre-plant lime) and 6.4 (pre-plant limed), respectively. The rootstock cultivars included 9 interspecific Prunus hybrids and 3 non-peach Prunus species. Growth, phenology, fruit maturity, fruit quality, and yield were collected annually. Significant differences among rootstocks were observed for growth, fruit maturity, yield and fruit quality attributes. Vigorous rootstocks were Viking, Atlas, BH-5, Empyrean (R) 1, Guardian (R) and Replantpac. The most dwarfing rootstocks included Krymsk (R) 1, Controller 5, P. americana, Fortuna and HBOK 32. Fortuna showed incompatibility symptoms. Trees on Imperial California were very susceptible to bacterial canker. Plum hybrids and species advanced maturity by 2-5 days. Yields in the early years were positively associated with tree vigor except for Fortuna, which yielded poorly. Yield efficiency was low for Empyrean (R) 1 and high for semi-dwarfing and dwarfing plum rootstocks and HBOK 32. Fruit size averaged >185 g for all rootstocks. There were small differences in fruit soluble solids among rootstocks with those of plum parentage having higher levels and fruit from trees on Krymsk (R) 1, Fortuna and P. americana having the highest Brix readings. No rootstock has emerged as the best at this time, though many appear adaptable to the local climate and soils.					10th International Symposium on Integrating Canopy, Rootstock and Environmental Physiology in Orchard Systems10th International Symposium on Integrating Canopy, Rootstock and Environmental Physiology in Orchard Systems	DEC 03-06, 2012DEC 03-06, 2012	Int Soc Hort SciInt Soc Hort Sci	Stellenbosch, SOUTH AFRICAStellenbosch, SOUTH AFRICA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-94-62610-48-4	WOS:000358040500064

Theron, K		Prunus mume Clones as Rootstocks for 'Aurora-1' Peach in Sao Paulo State, Brazil and Planting Density								X INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON INTEGRATING CANOPY, ROOTSTOCK AND ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY IN ORCHARD SYSTEMS		Acta Horticulturae		1058				619	626					2014	2014	Dwarf rootstocks allow high density in peach (Prunus persica) orchards and increase productivity. Since 1998, a research project has being carried out at the Faculdade de Ciencias Agrarias e Veterinarias (FCAV/UNESP), Jaboticabal Campus, Brazil, involving clones of Prunus mume as rootstocks for peach. In this research, two genotypes ('Clone 15' and 'Rigitano'), propagated by herbaceous cuttings, were tested as rootstocks for 'Aurora-1' peach in three in-row spacings: 6 m x 2 m, 6 m x 3 m and 6 m x 4 m. The experiment was carried out under field conditions in Vista Alegre do Alto (21 degrees 10'14"S, 48 degrees 37'45"W, 700 m of altitude), Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The region has an average accumulation of temperatures <= 7.0 degrees C of 17.9 h per year. Evaluations were taken in 2005 and 2006 (2nd and 3rd year after planting, respectively). There were no differences between the two rootstocks on fruit quality, yield and productivity, and no incompatibility symptoms were found on both scion/rootstock combinations. 'Rigitano' and 'Clone 15' are recommended as rootstocks for 'Aurora-1' peach, and the 6 m x 2 m spacing produced the highest fruit diameter and productivity per ha for 'Aurora-1'.					10th International Symposium on Integrating Canopy, Rootstock and Environmental Physiology in Orchard Systems10th International Symposium on Integrating Canopy, Rootstock and Environmental Physiology in Orchard Systems	DEC 03-06, 2012DEC 03-06, 2012	Int Soc Hort SciInt Soc Hort Sci	Stellenbosch, SOUTH AFRICAStellenbosch, SOUTH AFRICA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-94-62610-48-4	WOS:000358040500080

SI			193	212		10.1615/CritRevBiomedEng.2014011578			2014	2014	Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty revolutionized coronary and peripheral revascularization. However, it is always accompanied by major drawbacks such as elastic recoil and neointimal hyperplasia. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty along with bare metal stents reduced elastic recoil, but in-stent restenosis (ISR) and peripheral artery stenting remain problems. Drug-eluting stents addressed the issue of ISR, but late stent thrombosis and delayed endothelialization, along with longer dual antiplatelet therapy, are of concern. Non-stent-based delivery such as drug-coated balloons (DCBs) that can deliver drugs to inhibit ISR or to de novo lesions, are emerging at a rapid pace. DCBs carry an active drug and a nonpolymeric carrier molecule or excipient that enhance the bioavailability of the drug to the vessel wall. Preliminary studies of paclitaxel show sustained delivery is not required to inhibit proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, which leds to the development and evolution of DCBs. Recent clinical trials have been successful in mitigating ISR in coronary and peripheral arteries, but not in de novo lesions of coronary arteries. Clinical studies, although limited to date, show a promising future for DCBs.									0	1	0	0	0	1			0278-940X	1943-619X		BCI:BCI201500172429	25597236

SI			229	248		10.1615/CritRevBiomedEng.2014011715			2014	2014	Corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) with riboflavin and ultraviolet-A (UVA) light has become a viable treatment for keratoconus. In cases in which corneal transplant may have previously been a patient's primary treatment option, the results of CXL have varied from decreased progression of the disease to marked regression characterized by improvement in visual acuity. In addition, changes to the original protocol have been tested that include leaving the epithelium intact and increasing the UVA intensity while decreasing the exposure time. The variation in results and protocols underscores the need for a greater understanding of the procedure and its effects. Ideally, a complete definition of the effects of CXL will lead to patient-specific treatment through highly controlled delivery methods of riboflavin and UVA light and complete mathematical models for predicting the final shape and refractive effect of the cornea. Thus, in this review, we aimed to describe the current techniques for measuring the effect of CXL, with a focus on material property changes, while highlighting the challenge of engineering a predictable mathematical model of the procedure and the resulting clinical outcome.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0278-940X	1943-619X		BCI:BCI201500172431	25597238

IEEE					Next Generation Rope-like Robot for In-Space Inspection								2014 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE														2014	2014	Design of continuum robots, i.e. robots with continuous backbones, has been an active area of research in robotics for minimally invasive surgery, search and rescue, object manipulation, etc. Along the same lines, NASA developed "Tendril", the first long and thin continuum robot of its kind, intended for in-space inspection applications. In this paper, we describe and discuss the key disadvantages of state of the art mechanical design producing undesirable effects during operation. We then provide the specifics of a new, next generation, thin rope-like robot with a modified mechanical design for better performance having key features like controllable bending along its entire length, local compression and potentially smaller actuation package.

J	Wheeler, Alfred G., Jr; Krimmel, Billy A.								Mirid (Hemiptera: Heteroptera) Specialists of Sticky Plants: Adaptations, Interactions, and Ecological Implications.								Annual Review of Entomology				60				393	414					2014	2014	Sticky plants-those having glandular trichomes (hairs) that produce adhesive, viscous exudates-can impede the movement of, and entrap, generalist insects. Disparate arthropod groups have adapted to these widespread and taxonomically diverse plants, yet their interactions with glandular hosts rarely are incorporated into broad ecological theory. Ecologists and entomologists might be unaware of even well-documented examples of insects that are sticky-plant specialists. The hemipteran family Miridae (more specifically, the omnivorous Dicyphini: Dicyphina) is the best-known group of arthropods that specializes on sticky plants. In the first synthesis of relationships-with glandular plants for any insect family, we review mirid interactions with sticky hosts, including their adaptations (behavioral, morphological, and physiological) and mutualisms with carnivorous plants, and the ecological and agricultural implications of mirid-sticky plant systems. We propose that mirid research applies generally to tritrophic interactions on trichome-defended plants, enhances an understanding of insect-plant interactions, and provides information useful in managing crop pests.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0066-4170			ZOOREC:ZOOR15108051388

A key recently completed first step has been collating all available records into a comprehensive open access, traceable and version-controlled databank. The crucial next step is to maximise the value of the collated data through a robust international framework of benchmarking and assessment for product intercomparison and uncertainty estimation. We focus on uncertainties arising from the presence of inhomogeneities in monthly mean land surface temperature data and the varied methodological choices made by various groups in building homogeneous temperature products. The central facet of the benchmarking process is the creation of global-scale synthetic analogues to the real-world database where both the "true" series and inhomogeneities are known (a luxury the real-world data do not afford us). Hence, algorithmic strengths and weaknesses can be meaningfully quantified and conditional inferences made about the real-world climate system. Here we discuss the necessary framework for developing an international homogenisation benchmarking system on the global scale for monthly mean temperatures. The value of this framework is critically dependent upon the number of groups taking part and so we strongly advocate involvement in the benchmarking exercise from as many data analyst groups as possible to make the best use of this substantial effort.									4	0	0	0	0	4			2193-0856	2193-0864		WOS:000357286600008		
J	Bodde, David L.			IEEE					Ethics and the Allocation of Risk in Engineering Design								2014 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON ETHICS IN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND ENGINEERING														2014	2014	Any engineering design allocates risk among its several constituencies: customers, users, manufacturers, the public at large, and so forth. Techniques for risk management are well known and widely practiced, but the role of virtue in guiding risk allocation is less clear. This essay contrasts two worldviews with contrasting concepts of virtue: that of the naturalist, which holds that the physical universe is all that exists, and that morality derives from human reason alone; and that of the theist, believing the physical universe to be created by divine fiat, and that human reason should be informed by principles set by a high, creator God. Defining a personal worldview is central to the ethics of risk allocation. Persuading students to do this becomes the central issue in teaching ethics in the engineering classroom.

Millimeter-sized gold and amazonite particles show particle position, size, and material strongly affect quantitative RF measurements. Lossy materials do not significantly reduce the effective quality factor, which is as high as 30,000 at 1.2 GHz, of the sensor. Thus, the sensor is particularly suitable for biomedical applications such as skin cancer detection and the development of novel label-free and all electronic rheological instrumentation.

The analysis uses Prony algorithm that is capable of fitting a given set of data into damped exponentials. The uniqueness is based on the execution of oscillation monitoring algorithm on a high performance computing framework enabling the online execution. The parallel implementation of Prony analysis enables the rate of the moving window to be higher than the sequential code.. The test system is simulated on Real Time Digital Simulator and the relevant signals of the synchronous generators are communicated to the computing platform for subsequent analysis.

IEEE					Online Coherency Analysis of Synchronous Generators in a Power System								2014 IEEE PES INNOVATIVE SMART GRID TECHNOLOGIES CONFERENCE (ISGT)														2014	2014	In multi-machine power systems, synchronous generators tend to oscillate in several coherent groups, each group being equivalent to a virtual generator. Coherency analysis is fundamental to wide area control of large power systems. Usually, coherency analysis is carried out in an offline mode. However, in response to various events at different operating conditions, the coherent groups may differ. Thus, it is important to develop the analysis to be online. In this paper, K-harmonic means clustering (KHMC) approach is introduced for online analysis. This approach is insensitive to initialization of group centers and is fast. Besides, a second algorithm is developed to automatically determine the optimal number of groups during the online analysis for KHMC. Simulation results are presented using the IEEE 68-bus 16-machine power system. The results indicate that KHMC approach correctly identifies the group centers and assigns each generator to its corresponding group.

This method operates by capturing and storing the pixel space locations of a series of real world control points. These control points are then used as ground truth references by which virtual space transformations can be automatically generated for a display system.

Coquillart, S; Kiyokawa, K; Swan, JE; Bowman, D		Development of a Scenario Builder Tool for Scaffolded Virtual Patients								2014 IEEE VIRTUAL REALITY (VR)								131	132					2014	2014	Simulation training using virtual patients can provide many benefits for nursing and medcial students in learning patient interaction skills, especially since virtual patients can represent a wide range of patient scenarios and demographics that are not typically represented through roleplay or clinical rotations. However, creation of a single virtual patient scenario may take six months or more, so it is difficult to provide many unique scenarios during the course of a nurse's education. In this work, I propose the user-centered design, creation, and evaluation of a scenario-builder tool to enable nursing faculty to create their own scenarios, reducing development costs.

Leveraging rapid prototyping techniques for fabrication, we have developed a variety of panels that can be overlaid on multi-touch tablets and smartphones. The panels are coupled with an app running on the multi-touch device that exchanges commands and state information over a wireless network with the virtual reality application. Sculpted features of the panels provide tactile disambiguation of control widgets and an onscreen heads-up display provides interaction state information. A variety of interaction mappings can be provided through software to support several classes of interaction techniques in virtual environments. We foresee additional uses for applications where eyes-free use and adaptable interaction interfaces can be beneficial.

Through an overview of various case study applications, this presentation will discuss the relevant phases of model validation: numerical model development, field experimentation, model calibration and validation. The main goals of this paper are (i) to discuss where modeling errors and uncertainties originate and (ii) to present an approach to obtain model predictions that are statistically consistent with their respective measurements. Our approach considers all major sources of error and uncertainty, which originate from the numerical solutions of differential equations (numerical uncertainty), imprecise model input parameter values (parameter uncertainty), incomplete definitions of underlying physics due to assumptions and idealizations (bias error) and variability in measurements (experimental uncertainty). This paper provides an overview of the best-practices for developing finite element models for large-scale masonry monuments, designing and executing calibration experiments as well as calibrating numerical models under uncertainty.					9th International Conference on Structural Dynamics (EURODYN)9th International Conference on Structural Dynamics (EURODYN)	JUN 30-JUL 02, 2014JUN 30-JUL 02, 2014		Porto, PORTUGALPorto, PORTUGAL	0	0	0	0	0	0			2311-9020		978-972-752-165-4	WOS:000354786603088		
S	Atamturktur, Sez; Stevens, Garrison						Cunha, A; Caetano, E; Ribeiro, P; Muller, G		Uncertainty inference for inexact coupled numerical models in partitioned analysis								EURODYN 2014: IX INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON STRUCTURAL DYNAMICS		EURODYN-International Conference on Structural Dynamics						2759	2766					2014	2014	Advancements in parallel computing have brought partitioned analysis to the forefront of numerical modeling and simulation practices. The strongly coupled models obtained through partitioned analysis are instrumental in making critical decisions that may affect public safety such as failure analysis of structures in extreme conditions, performance of ballistic missile systems, and reliability of nuclear reactor cladding. Scientists and engineers who develop coupled models as well as decision makers who depend on these models' predictions need an understanding of the credibility of such complex modeling efforts. To ensure satisfactory predictive performance, the development of frameworks and methods for verification and validation of coupled models must complement the progress that is currently being made in multi-scale, multi-physics modeling and simulation. A unique aspect of partitioned analysis is that the iterative nature of coupling operations causes uncertainties and errors in constituent models to be passed back and forth through the interface, which may lead to the accumulation of these uncertainties and errors in the coupled model. Understanding and quantifying the sources of uncertainties and errors in the coupled models would therefore allow model developers to strategically improve the model's predictive capability. Such understanding would also open the door for optimization of the allocation of resources for conducting calibration experiments and for further developing the computer code. With advancements in verification and validation frameworks and methods specifically tailored for partitioned analysis, strongly coupled models can be used with confidence to garner previously unavailable knowledge for critical engineering applications.					9th International Conference on Structural Dynamics (EURODYN)9th International Conference on Structural Dynamics (EURODYN)	JUN 30-JUL 02, 2014JUN 30-JUL 02, 2014		Porto, PORTUGALPorto, PORTUGAL	0	0	0	0	0	0			2311-9020		978-972-752-165-4	WOS:000354786603093

In this work, we propose a numerically exact approach for computing the sensitivites required to construct local consistent tangent operators in computational inelasticity applications. The tangent operators that come from the derivatives of constitutive equations are necessary for achieving quadratic convergence in integrating material models at the integration point level. Unlike finite difference- based numerical methods, the approach proposed in this work is based on an exact differentiation technique called automatic differentiation (AD). The method is efficient, robust and easy to incorporate. Numerical examples in both small- and large-deformation inelasticity problems with complicated material models are presented to illustrate the efficiency and applicability of the proposed method.					143rd TMS Annual Meeting & Exhibition143rd TMS Annual Meeting & Exhibition	FEB 16-20, 2014FEB 16-20, 2014		San Diego, CASan Diego, CA	1	0	0	0	0	1					978-1-118-88985-5; 978-1-118-88972-5	WOS:000354941300038

Thanks to the unprecedented combination of effective area and spectral resolution of its main instrument, LOFT will study the behaviour of matter under extreme conditions, such as the strong gravitational field in the innermost regions of accretion flows close to black holes and neutron stars, and the supranuclear densities in the interior of neutron stars. The science payload is based on a Large Area Detector (LAD, 10 m(2) effective area, 2-30 keV, 240 eV spectral resolution, 1 degrees collimated field of view) and a Wide Field Monitor (WFM, 2-50 keV, 4 steradian field of view, 1 arcmin source location accuracy, 300 eV spectral resolution). The WFM is equipped with an on-board system for bright events (e.g. GRB) localization. The trigger time and position of these events are broadcast to the ground within 30 s from discovery. In this paper we present the status of the mission at the end of its Phase A study.

POET will use X-ray and gamma-ray polarimetry to uncover the energy release mechanism associated with the formation of stellar-mass black holes and investigate the physics of extreme magnetic fields in the vicinity of compact objects. Two wide-FoV, non-imaging polarimeters will provide polarization measurements over the broad energy range from about 2 keV up to about 500 keV. A Compton scatter polarimeter, using an array of independent scintillation detector elements, will be used to collect data from 50 keV up to 500 keV. At low energies (2-15 keV), data will be provided by a photoelectric polarimeter based on the use of a Time Projection Chamber for photoelectron tracking. During a two-year baseline mission, POET will be able to collect data that will allow us to distinguish between three basic models for the inner jet of gamma-ray bursts.

This technology has the potential to augment systems in which an operator tracks the positions of targets. Prior work has established that listeners can locate sounds in VAEs, however less is known concerning listener memory for virtual sounds. In this study, three experimental tasks assessed listener recall of sound positions and identities, using free and cued recall, with one or more delays. Overall, accuracy degrades as listeners recall the environment, however when using free recall, listeners exhibited less degradation.

Psychomotor skills learning involves the association of cognitive functions with motor functions to make the task autonomous with repeated practice, and promoting better recall. In electrical circuitry, this is demonstrated by the fine movements involved in handling and manipulating components on the electrical circuit, particularly while measuring electrical parameters that facilitates learning. Two display metaphors are currently implemented in IBAS, the FishtankVR (FVR) and head-mounted display (HMD) viewing conditions. In an initial user study, we found that users effectively learned the psychomotor skills pertaining to electrical circuitry using IBAS.

This spurred a dramatic growth in aggregate computational performance of the largest supercomputing systems, yielding multiple Petascale implementations deployed in various locations over the world. Unfortunately, these advances did not translate to the required extent into accompanying I/O systems, which primarily saw the improvement in cumulative storage sizes required to match the ever expanding volume of scientific data sets, but little more in terms of architecture or effective access latency. Moreover, while new models of computations are formulated to handle the burden of efficiently structuring the parallel computations in anticipation of the arrival of Exascale systems, a meager progress is observed in the area of storage subsystems. New classes of algorithms developed for massively parallel applications, that gracefully handle the challenges of asynchrony, heavily multithreaded distributed codes, and message-driven computation, must be matched by similar advances in I/O methods and algorithms to produce a well performing and balanced supercomputing system. This paper discusses PXFS, a file system model for persistent objects inspired by the ParalleX model of execution that addresses many of these challenges. An early implementation of PXFS utilizing a well known Orange parallel file system as its back-end via asynchronous I/O layer is also described along with the preliminary performance data. The results show perfect scalability and 3x to 20x times speedup of I/O throughput performance comparing to OrangeFS user interface. Also the PXFS module on OrangeFS with 24 clients sees a 5x to 10x times more throughput than NFS.

Effects of the commercial in ovo injection of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol on broiler posthatch performance and carcass characteristics								POULTRY SCIENCE				93	1			155	162		10.3382/ps.2013-03389			JAN 2014	2014	In ovo injection of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol [25(OH)D-3] has been shown to improve hatchability of injected broiler eggs. Effects of the in ovo injection of commercial diluent containing various levels of 25(OH)D-3 on broiler posthatch performance and carcass characteristics were investigated in 2 trials. on each of 10 tray levels of a single-stage incubator, all treatment groups were randomly represented with each containing 21 and 40 eggs in trials 1 and 2, respectively. Treatments included noninjected and diluent-injected (100 mu L commercial diluent-injected) controls, and those that received 0.15, 0.30, 0.60, or 1.20 mu g of 25(OH)D-3 in trial 1 and 0.20, 0.60, 1.80, or 5.4 mu g of 25(OH)D-3 in trial 2, in 100 mu L of commercial diluent using a commercial multi-egg injector on d 18 of incubation. on d 21 of incubation, chicks from each treatment replicate group were placed in corresponding floor pens. Feed intake, BW gain, and feed conversion were determined for the weekly and cumulative 0 to 21 d age intervals in trial 1 and for the weekly and cumulative 0 to 48 d age intervals in trial 2. In trial 2, 2 birds from each sex were selected from each treatment replicate group for determination of processing carcass characteristics on d 49 posthatch. Feed intake in the 0 to 7, 7 to 14, and 14 to 21 d age intervals and BW gain in the 0 to 7 and 14 to 21 d age intervals were affected by treatment in trial 2. The in ovo injection of up to 1.20 and 0.60 mu g of 25(OH)D-3 in trials 1 and 2, respectively, did not affect the BW gain of birds during the 0 to 7, 7 to 14, and 14 to 21 d age intervals compared with the noninjected and diluent-injected control groups. It was concluded that the in ovo injection of up to 1.20 mu g of 25(OH)D-3 into the amnion has no detrimental effect on the overall posthatch performance of broilers.									4	0	0	4	0	4			0032-5791	1525-3171		WOS:000334041800021	24570435

Not Yet a Woman, Not Yet a Mom The Leisure Experiences of Pregnant Adolescents								JOURNAL OF LEISURE RESEARCH				46	5			509	524					2014	2014	Pregnant adolescents are a unique group; they are not yet women and not yet mothers. Adolescent pregnancy continues to be a prominent social issue; however, little research exists concerning the leisure of pregnant adolescents. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to examine pregnant adolescents' leisure experiences from their own points of view. Although exploratory, findings suggest that pregnant adolescents make a concerted effort to change their leisure behavior for the health of their unborn baby and develop new forms of child-centered leisure during pregnancy. The participants also expressed mixed feelings regarding the role leisure will have in their lives once they are mothers. Overall, adolescent pregnancy is not an easy adjustment for adolescents and greatly affects their leisure.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0022-2216	2159-6417		WOS:000345193700001

IEEE					A CMI (Cell Metabolic Indicator)-based Controller for Achieving High Growth Rate Escherichia coli Cultures								2014 36TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF THE IEEE ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY SOCIETY (EMBC)		IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society Conference Proceedings						2911	2915					2014	2014	A large fraction of biopharmaceuticals are produced in Escherichia coli, where each new product and strain currently requires a high degree of growth characterization in benchtop and industrial bioreactors to achieve economical production protocols. The capability to use a standard set of sensors to characterize a system quickly without the need to conduct numerous experiments to determine stable growth rate for the strain would significantly decrease development time. This paper presents a cell metabolic indicator (CMI) which provides better insight into the E. coli metabolism than a growth rate value. The CMI is the ratio of the oxygen uptake rate (OUR) of the culture and the base addition rate (BAR) required to keep pH at a desired setpoint. The OUR and BAR are measured using a off-gas sensor and pH probe, respectively, and thus the CMI can be computed online. Experimental results demonstrate the relationship between CMI and the different cell metabolic states. A previously published model is augmented with acid production dynamics, allowing for comparison of the CMI-based controller with an open-loop controller in simulation. The CMI-based controller required little a priori knowledge about the E. coli strain in order to achieve a high growth rate. Since many different types of cells exhibit similar behaviors, the CMI concept can be extended to mammalian and stem cells.					36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 26-30, 2014AUG 26-30, 2014	IEEE Engn Medicine & Biol SocIEEE Engn Medicine & Biol Soc	Chicago, ILChicago, IL	0	0	0	0	0	0			1557-170X		978-1-4244-7929-0	WOS:000350044702223

However, accurate estimation of OTR is challenging due to the difficulty of determining uncertain oxygen transfer parameters and system dynamics. This paper presents an adaptive estimator, which incorporates exhaust gas, stir speed and dissolved oxygen measurements, to predict the real-time OTR. The design of this estimator takes into account the headspace dilution effect, off-gas sensor dynamics and uncertain oxygen transfer parameters. Through simulation the estimated real-time OTR is shown to accurately track quick changes of oxygen demand in the culture. Thus, it can be applied to a variety of controls and estimation purposes, such as determining when the culture is in oxidative or overflow metabolism.					36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)36th Annual International Conference of the IEEE-Engineering-in-Medicine-and-Biology-Society (EMBC)	AUG 26-30, 2014AUG 26-30, 2014	IEEE Engn Medicine & Biol SocIEEE Engn Medicine & Biol Soc	Chicago, ILChicago, IL	0	0	0	0	0	0			1557-170X		978-1-4244-7929-0	WOS:000350044706047

IEEE					Impact of Distribution System Reconfiguration on Optimal Placement of Phasor Measurement Units								2014 CLEMSON UNIVERSITY POWER SYSTEMS CONFERENCE (PSC)		Clemson University Power Systems Conference												2014	2014	Phasor measurement units (PMUs) become a necessity in the modern distribution system especially with the direction towards smart grid. The PMUs should be placed appropriately in the distribution network. The problem of optimal PMU placement for full observability is analyzed in literature. Distribution network reconfiguration for loss reduction is also analyzed in literature. This paper studies the placement problem of PMUs in distribution system considering the system reconfiguration. System reconfiguration is achieved using the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm to solve the minimum losses problem. Greedy algorithm is used as an optimization tool to obtain the minimal number of PMUs and their corresponding locations. The 33-node distribution system is tested for optimally locating the PMUs with different network reconfiguration.

The PMU collects bus voltage, line current, and frequency measurements and uses the communication network to send the measurements to the respective substation(s)/control center(s). Since this approach relies on network infrastructure, possible cyber security vulnerabilities have to be addressed to ensure that is stable, secure, and reliable. In this paper, security vulnerabilities associated with a synchrophasor network in a benchmark IEEE 68 bus (New England/New York) power system model are examined. Currently known feasible attacks are demonstrated. Recommended testing and verification methods are also presented.

IEEE					Energy Packets Enabling the Energy Internet								2014 CLEMSON UNIVERSITY POWER SYSTEMS CONFERENCE (PSC)		Clemson University Power Systems Conference												2014	2014	There has been considerable interest in the scientific community in the nature of the future power system. Having distributed resources, energy storage, and plug-and-play capability makes the future power system analogous to a computer network and some refer to this future power system as the "energy internet". Ironically, concerns of the future power system, such as reliability, survivability, availability, and security also parallel those of computer networks. This paper introduces a circuit whereby power can be sent in "energy packets" much like information is routed in a computer network. This opens up the possibility of applying information network theory, such as path diversity, packet acknowledgement, resource management, ad hoc network routing, network topology control, network security, etc. to the power system. Simulation examples and laboratory measurements validate the fundamental circuit. Implications for future power networks are discussed.

IEEE					Optimal Utilization of STATCOM Devices in a Power System with High Penetration of Wind Generation								2014 CLEMSON UNIVERSITY POWER SYSTEMS CONFERENCE (PSC)		Clemson University Power Systems Conference												2014	2014	As wind generation penetration increases in older power networks, a system becomes more vulnerable due to intermittency of the wind. It is desired to replace more conventional power with wind generation, but this may lead to overloaded lines as well as low voltage buses. In certain cases the power system may even collapses (i. e., no valid load flow solution exists). Static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) devices can provide significant reactive power to ensure the voltage stability, but they should be optimally designed, for both their ratings and locations, because of their high costs of installation. Based on a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, this paper introduces a general approach to determine the optimal location and sizing of the STATCOM devices for the power system with low-voltage buses or no valid load flow solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the voltage stability of the power system is achieved after the STATCOM devices are optimally placed, for all the potential stochastic output powers of the wind plants.

The most prevalent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) monomer units, the extent of alkylation on each unit, and the nature of the linkages connecting monomer units to form oligomers have all been determined. The use of two relatively new techniques, supercritical fluid extraction (SCE) for isolating the pitch into its constituent oligomers to enable analytical characterization, and MALDI mass spectrometry for determining absolute molecular weights and the extent of alkylation, proved to be invaluable in determining the molecular structures of the pitch species. A number of independent analytical methods all confirm that the thermal polymerization process to form pitch oligomers has a minimal impact on the monomer unit building blocks: four hydrogens are lost between two monomer units to form a 5- or 6-membered connecting ring, and most of the alkyl groups on the monomer units are retained. A 97% trimer cut with an average molecular weight of 750 Da was isolated via SCE and was found to contain a significant proportion of bulk mesophase. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the true molecular weight of a petroleum or coal-tar pitch mesophase has been determined.

Naskar, AK; Hoffman, WP		Carbon Fibers Derived from Acetylated Softwood Kraft Lignin								POLYMER PRECURSOR-DERIVED CARBON		ACS Symposium Series		1173				137	152					2014	2014	A commercial softwood kraft lignin (SKL, Indulin AT) was processed into precursor fibers after acetylation of SKL to different degrees of substitution. The acetylated SKL (Ace-SKL) with higher extent of substitution was extracted with acetic acid resulting in a material that could be melt-spun, but those fibers became tacky during thermo-oxidation. Ace-SKL with lower substitution extent was chosen for solution spinning using acetone as solvent. It was found that both softening point and glassy transition temperature of Ace-SKL increased as the extent of acetylation decreased, which is favorable for the subsequent stabilization step. The Ace-SKL fibers derived from lower extent of substitution were successfully thermo-oxidatively stabilized and subsequently carbonized at 1000 degrees C under tension to retain molecular orientation within the fibers. These carbon fibers displayed low crystallinity as investigated by WAXD and Raman spectroscopy. Resulting carbon fibers displayed a tensile modulus, strength, and strain-to-failure values of 52 +/- 2 GPa, 1.06 +/- 0.07 GPa, and 2.0 +/- 0.2%, respectively. Because of solvent diffusion during dry-spinning, fibers displayed a crenulated surface, which can provide a larger specific interfacial area for enhanced fiber/matrix bonding in composite applications.

J	Putman, Bradley J.; Lyons, Kimberly R.								Evaluation of Warm-Mix and Rubber-Modified Open-Graded Friction Course Test Sections Made Without Fibers in South Carolina								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD					2446			70	77		10.3141/2446-08			2014	2014	This paper summarizes the performance of open-graded friction course (OGFC) mixtures used to construct two experimental pavement test sections in South Carolina. The study's main objective was to evaluate OGFC mixtures made without fibers. One test section consisted of three OGFC mixtures [control with cellulose fibers, ground tire rubber modified without fibers, and warm-mix asphalt (WMA) without fibers], and the second consisted of two OGFC mixtures (control with cellulose fibers and WMA without fibers). Material was sampled from the asphalt plant during production. Tests were conducted on the fresh mix as well as specimens compacted at the plant and after reheating in the research lab. Results showed that the removal of fibers from the OGFC mixtures in both projects did not have any detrimental effects on the mix performance (drain down, permeability, abrasion resistance, indirect tensile strength, and fatigue resistance). The WMA mixture made with Evotherm exhibited increased fatigue resistance compared with the control mixture even though the WMA mixture did not contain cellulose fibers. In addition, the WMA mixture showed the potential to reduce heat loss resulting from the startup of the paving operation (i.e., running asphalt mix through a cold material transfer vehicle and then a cold paver). Limiting heat loss could improve the consistency of the OGFC mat density from the beginning transverse cold joint and thus potentially enhance the pavement performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0361-1981	2169-4052		WOS:000351879700009

SmartParks (large numbers of electric vehicles capable of performing bidirectional power transactions) or energy storage systems can be used to improve the transient stability of a smart grid with wind farms when faults are experienced. In this paper, the speed oscillations in conventional generators are minimized by optimizing a fuzzy logic controller performing coordinated control between SmartParks and a wind farm. A novel heuristic search based algorithm, mean variance optimization, is applied for the optimization tasks. The results demonstrate the improvement in the overall transient stability of the system operating under disturbances at different locations in the system.

Because they are so widespread in number, their characteristics and response towards harmonic voltages present in single phase distribution systems are important. This paper outlines the response of these motors to harmonic voltages in some detail. It explains how the auxiliary winding circuit in these motors causes certain behaviors not normally associated with single winding run motors. This paper provides some background to understanding this behavior and then provides experimental demonstration for the peculiar phenomena that occur when the motor is subjected to a source voltage containing harmonics.

These units use pore forming agents to further reduce the thermal conductivity of the units in addition to the coring design. Thermal performance is often expressed as thermal conductance (C value) or the reciprocal value, thermal resistance (R-value). To investigate the effect of pore forming agents on thermal performance, a series of clay brick formulations were batched, mixed, extruded, and fired in the lab. In this study, organic pore forming agents with varying particle sizes were added to a clay body. The oxidation of the organic pore forming agents during firing resulted in residual pores which reduced the thermal conductivity of the brick. The residual porosity was created by the size, volume, and the addition rate of the pore forming agent added to the body and the firing degree of the clay body. The effect of the firing temperature was also investigated. For each composition, the thermal conductivity was tested using a heat flow meter according to ASTM C518. The thermal conductivity measurements were correlated with porosity and density measurements as well as other physical properties measured according to ASTM C67-31a: Standard Test Methods for Sampling and Testing Brick and Structural Clay Tile. The effect of size of the residual pores was studied to determine how the increased porosity reduced thermal conductivity while also decreasing strength. The potential durability of the bodies with pore forming agents was also considered.

Four sets of brick were included in the test which represented a range of brick configurations. Typically, very low values of air permeance were measured on the test brick panels. A maximum material permeance of 0.012 l/(s m(2)) was measured at 75 Pa for one of the test groups while the material permeance was less than 0.002 l/(s m(2)) at 75 Pa for the other three test groups in this study. Typically, pressure differentials greater than 150 Pa were required to produce a flow rate greater than 0.002 l/(s m(2)) for these test panels. In addition to the masonry system permeability tests, a series of material permeability measurements were made using ASTM C577: Standard Test Method for Permeability of Refractories on the individual components of the masonry system.

The performance of three controllers are shown here. The controllers can be classified into two categories: Closed-loop configuration-space control and closed-loop task-space teleoperation. Two controllers were tested in the configuration-space control experiments: a proportional-derivative (PD) controller and a nonlinear sliding-mode controller. The third controller is also shown in which the redundant extensible continuum manipulator tip tracks the motion of a kinematically-dissimilar non-redundant rigid-link master system. The results of these experiments confirm the ability of the control strategies to effectively control continuum robot hardware.

However, soft limbs can not yet transition to practical application due to difficulties associated with control methods. Motivated by this research problem, in this paper, we investigate the performance of energy based control of underactuated soft limbed systems. We augment the previously reported energy shaping function for rigid bipeds with a new set of functions for the novel class of underactuated compass gait soft bipeds. We evaluate the controller performance and identify desired features and characteristics for better speed performance of such a biped. The proposed energy shaping functions are compared through controlled Lagrangian (CL) method for Euler-Lagrangian (EL) models and interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control (IDA-PBC) methods for port-controlled Hamiltonian (PCH) models. Results for system stability, speed performance, and input torque profiles are compared. The IDA-PBC controllers are observed to produce better input torque and performance over the CL methods. The findings assist in extending and developing novel controllers to implement on soft limbed robots for practical control applications of soft multi-continuum limbed robots.

Mathematical models characterizing the magneto-elastic behavior and describing the effects of bias conditions - compressive prestress and magnetic bias - on the material performance, have been developed. For the most part, the models used to describe the material are linear models that can hide essential features of the dynamic performance. While nonlinear constitutive models of Terfenol-D exist, such models have not been utilized to study the dynamic frequency response characteristics that are essential towards a comprehensive understanding of its performance in actuation, sensing or energy harvesting. To address this problem, this effort investigates the role of empirically determined material nonlinearities in the dynamic performance of Terfenol-D. Towards that objective, a polynomial type stress-strain relation is used to construct a nonlinear distributed-parameters model for a Terfenol-D rod fixed at one end and mass loaded at the other while being subjected to a sinusoidal base excitation. Additionally, the model accounts for the rod being subjected to an axial prestress prior to excitation. Using the method of multiple scales, the nonlinear frequency response of the rod is investigated by obtaining analytical expressions for the steady-state response amplitude. It is demonstrated that the axial prestress results in a shift in the fundamental vibration frequencies of the rod and a change in the effective nonlinearity of the system. A qualitative analysis of the solution reveals that, the magnitude of axial load can be used to maximize the response amplitude over a larger bandwidth of frequencies.

The energy harvesting TMFD consists of a rectangular container carrying a magnetized ferrofluid and mounted on a vibrating structure. The ferrofluids geometric and material properties (height, surface area, magnetization) are tuned such the first modal frequency of the fluid column matches the first modal frequency of the structure. The one-to-one resonant interactions between the structure and the fluid column results in a direct energy transfer mechanism which mitigates the vibration of the structure by channeling energy to the ferrofluid. Consequently, the fluid undergoes a sloshing motion with large-amplitude surface waves that change the orientational order of the magnetic dipoles in the fluid. This creates a time-varying magnetic flux, which induces an electromotive force in a coil wound around the container. The electromotive force transforms a small part of the fluids kinetic energy into electricity by generating a current in the coil. Experimental studies performed on an actual TMFD prototype clearly demonstrate its vibration suppression potential and energy generation capabilities.

ASME					CONCURRENT ENERGY HARVESTING FROM VIBRATORY BASE EXCITATIONS AND AERODYNAMIC FLOWS								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME CONFERENCE ON SMART MATERIALS ADAPTIVE STRUCTURES AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS - 2013, VOL 2														2014	2014	This paper presents theoretical and experimental investigations into the potential of utilizing a piezoaeroelastic micropower generator to harvest energy from the combination of an external base excitation and an aerodynamic load. In particular, a harvester consisting of a rigid airfoil supported by a flexural piezoelectric beam and a torsional spring is placed in an incompressible air flow and subjected to an external harmonic base excitation in the plunge direction. Electromechanical equations describing the nonlinear system are given along with theoretical simulations. The performance of the piezoaeroelastic generator is studied experimentally below and above the flutter speed and found to exhibit qualitative agreement with the theory. Below the flutter speed, the response of the harvester is observed to be always periodic with the air flow serving to amplify the influence of the base excitation on the response by reducing the effective stiffness of the system, and hence, increasing the RMS output power. Beyond the flutter speed, the harvester's response and its performance were observed to depend on the nearness of the excitation frequency to the frequency of the self-sustained oscillations induced by the flutter instability and the magnitude of the base excitation. When the base excitation is small and/or the excitation frequency is not close to the frequency of the self-sustained oscillations, the response of the harvester is two-period quasiperiodic with amplitude modulation due to the presence of two incommensurate frequencies. This amplitude modulation reduces the RMS output power. On the other hand, when the frequency of excitation is close to the frequency of the self-sustained oscillations and/or the amplitude of excitation is large enough to quench the quasiperiodic behavior, the response becomes periodic and the output power increases exhibiting little dependence on the base excitation.

A majority of global iodine budget resides in ocean while lithosphere and pedosphere contain the rest limiting the bio-availability of iodine in terrestrial environment. Iodine cycles involve the multivalence state chemical speciation at the air-water-sediment interfaces. The mobility and reactivity of these inorganic and organic iodine species are impacted by changes in physicochemical factors (e.g., pH and ionic strength), and macro-and micro-biological activities. Although iodine aqueous biogeochemistry has been extensively investigated in marine systems in the past, the partitioning mechanisms of iodine at the geomedia-water interface remained poorly understood. This chapter covers environmental soil chemistry of iodine and the impact to human and ecological health.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0065-2113		978-0-12-802352-5; 978-0-12-802139-2	WOS:000348704100003

A two state equivalent electric circuit model coupled with a two state thermal model is defined and parameterized to develop a four state control oriented electro-thermal model for cylindrical double layer ultracapacitors. The proposed two state equivalent electric circuit model mimics the terminal voltage dynamics and could be used to evaluate the power capability and efficiency of the cell. The electric model parameters are estimated by pulse-relaxation tests for sub-zero temperatures as low as -40 degrees C. The two state thermal model provides a tool to estimate the surface and core temperature dynamics. The two models are then coupled through the reversible plus irreversible heat generation and also via temperature dependence of the equivalent circuit model parameters. The modeled terminal voltage and surface temperature dynamics are in good agreement with experimental observations for fixed environmental temperature with forced air cooling.

Compared to conventional data-driven or equivalent circuit models often employed in battery management systems, electrochemical battery models have the potential to give physically accurate the SOC information by tracking the Li-ion concentration in each electrode. In this paper, two nonlinear observer designs are presented to estimate Li-ion battery State-of-Charge based on reductions of an electrochemical model. The first observer design uses a constant gain Luenberger structure whereas the second one improves it by weighing the gain with the output Jacobian. For both observer designs, Lyapunov's direct method is applied and the design problems are converted to solving LMIs. Simulation results are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of both observer designs.

IEEE					Spatio-Temporal Oscillation Monitoring in Spatially Distributed Power System Networks Using Energy Functions								2014 AMERICAN CONTROL CONFERENCE (ACC)		Proceedings of the American Control Conference						753	758					2014	2014	In this paper we consider continuum models of power system networks divided into clusters, and present a model reduction method to derive the analytical expressions for frequency waves propagating from one cluster to another depending on the network topology. Previous results have modeled such electromechanical waves mostly for two-area radial transfer paths, i.e., for two-node line graphs. Our results extend this approach to a network of areas connected by equivalent transfer paths by defining an equivalent SturmLiouville eigenvalue equation for the clustered network. We derive analytical expressions for the equivalent damping and power spectrum of this eigenvalue problem, as well for the spatio-temporal kinetic and potential energy functions that may used for transient stability assessment of the clustered network model following a disturbance.

The valve is a 4/3, center closed configuration. The model is developed based on first principles and is compared to a dynamic model in the form of a Simulink S-function made available by Moog Inc. The model is developed as part of a system level modeling, simulation, and analysis activity at Clemson University's Wind Turbine Drivetrain Testing Facility. The valve model is valuable because the valve is used to control a primary piece of test equipment at the facility and the model will be used for subsequent control system development activities. Results show that the derived model adequately reproduces the behavior of the supplied S-function while offering greatly improved functionality. Additionally, a discussion section address the observed differences between the derived model and the supplied S-function and offers a critique of the S-function's performance.

A planar MOVA system design is presented as the first step toward a fully functioning 3D system. The design has the minimum number of joints for the end-effector to achieve trajectory tracking. Dynamics equations of this planar MOVA system are derived using the Euler-Lagrangian approach and then transformed into decoupled translational and rotational dynamics using the virtual manipulator method. The backstepping technique is adopted for controller design due to the underactuated translational dynamics and a feedback linearization controller is used to control the onboard manipulator dynamics. A stability analysis is performed on the unified controller with GUUB tracking performance proven.

We assume prior knowledge of upcoming terrain. Furthermore human pedaling force constraints are estimated by using a phenomenological fatigue dynamics model. Using upcoming terrain information, estimated rider's state of fatigue (SOF), measured velocity, cadence, and state of charge (SOC) of the battery, the optimal solution to the problem is obtained via a three-state dynamic programming (DP) approach. The proposed solution guides the rider by suggesting an optimal reference velocity and also optimally adjusts the electric-human power split. The optimal solution is compared to aggressive and conservative rule-based strategies that we have devised. Simulation results show that travel time can be significantly reduced with the optimal control approach.

These vehicles are prone to rollover issues and compromised ride quality. A cascade control structure is proposed considering a time scale analysis of the various modes in the vehicles' dynamics. The structure consists of: a) an upper level predictive anti-roll controller that uses road preview information for generating an optimal reference roll angle, yaw rate and roll moment distribution, and b) a lower level sprung/unsprung mass motion controller that tracks the reference roll angle and regulates other states. Simulation results indicate that the proposed system is able to reduce sprung mass acceleration, improve tire-road contact, stabilize roll motion and enhance the yaw response of the vehicle.

Consuming Fire Ants Reduces Northern Bobwhite Survival and Weight Gain								Journal of Agricultural and Urban Entomology				30	1			49	58					JAN 2014	2014	Northern bobwhite quail, Colinus virginianus (L.) (Galliformes: Odontophoridae), population declines are well documented, but pinpointing the reasons for these decreases has proven elusive. Bobwhite population declines are attributed primarily to loss of habitat and land use changes. This, however, does not entirely explain population declines in areas intensively managed for bobwhites. Although previous research demonstrates the negative impact of red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta Buren) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) on northern bobwhites, the mechanisms underlying this effect are largely unknown. To meet the protein demands of early growth and development, bobwhite chicks predominantly consume small insects, of which ants are a substantial proportion. Fire ants alter ant community dynamics by often reducing native ant diversity and abundance while concurrently increasing the abundance of individuals. Fire ants have negative effects on chicks, but they are also a large potential protein source, making it difficult to disentangle their net effect on bobwhite chicks. To help investigate these effects, we conducted a laboratory experiment to understand (1) whether or not bobwhites consume fire ants, and (2) how the benefits of this consumption compare to the deleterious impacts of bobwhite chick exposure to fire ants. Sixty bobwhite chicks were separated into two groups of 30; one group was provided with starter feed only and the second group was provided with feed and fire ants. Bobwhite chicks were observed feeding on fire ants. Chicks that fed on fire ants had reduced survival and weight gain. Our results show that, while fire ants increase potential food sources for northern bobwhite, their net effect on bobwhite chicks is deleterious. This information will help inform land managers and commercial bobwhite rearing operations.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1523-5475	2153-652X		BCI:BCI201500226758

With the ever-increasing rate of cyber attacks, this dependency places the nation at risk of a loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its critical information resources; degrading its ability to complete the mission. In this paper, we introduce the operational data classes for establishing situational awareness in cyberspace. A system effectively using our key information components will be able to provide the nation's leadership timely and accurate information to gain an understanding of the operational cyber environment to enable strategic, operational, and tactical decision-making. In doing so, we present, define and provide examples of our key classes of operational data for cyber situational awareness and present a hypothetical case study demonstrating how they must be consolidated to provide a clear and relevant picture to a commander. In addition, current organizational and technical challenges are discussed, and areas for future research are addressed.					6th International Conference on Cyber Conflict (CyCon)6th International Conference on Cyber Conflict (CyCon)	JUN 03-06, 2014JUN 03-06, 2014	IEEE; NATO Cooperat Cyber Def Ctr Excellence; Microsoft; Verint; Intel; Cisco; Lancope; Ixia; IBMIEEE; NATO Cooperat Cyber Def Ctr Excellence; Microsoft; Verint; Intel; Cisco; Lancope; Ixia; IBM	Tallinn, ESTONIATallinn, ESTONIA	0	0	0	0	0	0			2325-5366		978-9949-9544-0-7	WOS:000349046200012

Thus, computationally-efficient models for electric machines and drives are essential for powertrain-level design, simulation, and optimization. In this paper, a finite-element-based method for quickly generating torque-speed curves and efficiency maps for electric machines and drives is presented. First, magneto-static finite element analysis (FEA) is conducted on a "base" machine design. This analysis produces normalized torque, flux linkage, current, and losses for the operating points of interest. These values are then adjusted based upon changing the size of the machine and the effective number of turns of the machine windings to quickly generate a variety of new machine designs and their corresponding efficiency maps. Results suggest that the proposed techniques can be useful for EV/HEV powertrain design and optimization.					29th Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition (APEC)29th Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition (APEC)	MAR 16-20, 2014MAR 16-20, 2014	IEEEIEEE	Fort Worth, TXFort Worth, TX	0	0	0	0	0	0			1048-2334		978-1-4799-2325-0	WOS:000349212501112

J	Dey, Kakan C.; Chowdhury, Mashrur; Pang, Weichiang; Putman, Bradley J.; Chen, Linbo								Estimation of Pavement and Bridge Damage Costs Caused by Overweight Trucks								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD					2411			62	71		10.3141/2411-08			2014	2014	This study adopted a damage quantification framework to estimate bridge and pavement damage caused by overweight trucks. The framework was applied to estimate unit overweight truck damage costs for the highway system maintained by the South Carolina Department of Transportation. The analysis revealed that pavement and bridge damage increased significantly when trucks were above legal weight limits. Tradeoffs between the most common overweight truck fee types were estimated to examine their relative efficacy. The study found the axle-based damage cost recovery fee for the additional per trip damage cost above the legal weight limit for an overweight truck loaded up to the maximum overweight limit. The fee varied between $14 and $165 per trip, depending on the type of overweight truck. The flat damage cost recovery fee was $55 per trip for all overweight trucks (about two times the current flat damage fee in South Carolina). The study revealed that ignoring the axle distribution in the flat damage cost recovery fee caused some truck types to pay more and others to pay less than the actual damage they imparted. In a weight-based damage cost recovery fee system, the per trip damage cost recovery fee varied between $2.77 and $36.57 per ton; in a weight-distance-based damage cost recovery fee system, the damage fee varied between 2 and 14 cents per ton-mile. A comparative analysis between damage cost recovery fee types, such as the one presented in this paper, will provide insight to decision makers for setting policies regarding overweight trucking fees.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0361-1981	2169-4052		WOS:000349276000008		
S	Yang, Fan; Gondi, Vamsi; Hallstrom, Jason O.; Wang, Kuang-Ching; Eidson, Gene			IEEE					OpenFlow-based Load Balancing for Wireless Mesh Infrastructure								2014 IEEE 11TH CONSUMER COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING CONFERENCE (CCNC)		IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference												2014	2014	Wireless mesh-based backhaul infrastructure is intended to provide reliable data transmission, with high throughput across large-scale networks. Load balancing is essential over a long period of operation to provide high throughput and uninterrupted service to end users. Load across mesh nodes is highly variable as the traffic depends on the number of clients connected to the nodes, as well as the services they use. Existing load balancing solutions are based on theoretical analysis and simulations. Most require distributed routing algorithms executed over compute-intensive routing nodes. It is also challenging to provide practical support for real-time traffic redirection using traditional mesh nodes. In this paper, we develop a prototype mesh infrastructure where flows from a source node can take multiple paths through the network. OpenFlow, an emerging technology that makes network switches programmable via a standard interface, allows flexible control of data flow paths. The Better Approach To Mobile Ad-hoc Networking (B.A.T.M.A.N) mesh protocol is used to provide mesh topology and link quality information. The OpenFlow controller decides the best data path based on this information to ensure high throughput data transfer. To demonstrate the usefulness of our approach, we have implemented three test cases to enable data path setup and redirection with low complexity and overhead. Our test case measurements confirm that OpenFlow is a promising complementary technology to traditional mesh routing protocols for wireless networks.

SI			213	227		10.1615/CritRevBiomedEng.2014011661			2014	2014	The heart is a large organ containing many cell types, each of which is necessary for normal function. Because of this, cardiac regenerative medicine presents many unique challenges. Because each of the many types of cells within the heart has unique physiological and electrophysiological characteristics, donor cells must be well matched to the area of the heart into which they are grafted to avoid mechanical dysfunction or arrhythmia. In addition, grafted cells must be functionally integrated into host tissue to effectively repair cardiac function. Because of its size and physiological function, the metabolic needs of the heart are considerable. Therefore grafts must contain not only cardiomyocytes but also a functional vascular network to meet their needs for oxygen and nutrition. In this article we review progress in the use of pluripotent stem cells as a source of donor cardiomyocytes and highlight current unmet needs in the field. We also examine recent tissue engineering approaches integrating cells with various engineered materials that should address some of these unmet needs.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0278-940X	1943-619X		BCI:BCI201500172430	25597237

SI			319	348		10.1615/CritRevBiomedEng.2014011662			2014	2014	Tissue engineering has been touted as the solution to regenerating tissue, yet current strategies for orthopedic application are limited because of the inability to successfully manage critical-sized defects without a working vascular system. Bone grafts are commonly used in critical-sized defects to fill the gap in missing bone tissue. Proper vasculature is vital to the success of these grafts and to promote bone growth. The aim of this review is to describe the contribution of tissues surrounding critical-sized defects, focusing in particular on the progenitor cell influx and factors contributing to neovascularization. An overview of clinical techniques to visualize patient vascular supply and an evaluation of clinical techniques to increase blood flow to the critical defect site illustrate the current efforts of surgical intervention to promote proper bone formation. Opportunity and need lie in the development of tissue-engineered bone grafts that can use and enhance available vascular supplies.									2	1	0	0	0	3			0278-940X	1943-619X		BCI:BCI201500172435	25597242

Representation of the catheter in KNIFE differs greatly from what is captured by the fluoroscope, due to distortions and other properties of fluoroscopic images. When imaged by a fluoroscope, catheters can be visualized due to the inclusion of radiopaque materials (i.e. Bi, Ba, W) in the polymer blend.3 However, in KNIFE catheter location is determined using a single tracking seed located in the catheter tip that is represented as a single point overlaid on pre-captured fluoroscopic images.To bridge the gap in catheter representation between KNIFE and traditional methods we constructed a catheter with five tracking seeds positioned along the distal 70 mm of the catheter. We have currently investigated the use of four spline interpolation methods for estimation of true catheter shape and have assesed the error in their estimation of true catheter shape. In this work we present a method for the evaluation of interpolation algorithms with respect to catheter shape determination.

REU grants provide individual faculty members (and teams of faculty) across the USA with funds to conduct program sites, which generally occur during the summer months and are thematically organized around a specific area of research. These faculty administrators are not only responsible for providing a high quality research experience to participants, but are also focused on successfully recruiting a diverse pool of applicants and ensuring acceptances from highly competitive participants. This study examines how applicants view the importance of programmatic and application factors. With a goal to provide practical implications for program administrators and others interested in promoting undergraduate research participation, this study primarily considered items identified as controllable by the site directors/administrators to improve recruitment efforts. This study also considered some additional factors, such as the geography of programs to which applications are submitted, that could potentially give insight into how students are choosing programs. An online survey was created and distributed to current program participants by participating research site administrators at 34 American institutions yielding 129 complete responses. Initial results confirmed that most applicants seek positions within an array of sites encompassing a broad area (median values: three applications and 763 miles from home). Analysis of participants' responses showed that 34% were offered multiple positions and 17% of respondents declined another employment offer before accepting their current position. The primary factors that student applicants consider important for impacting their selections were (1) focus of the research project, (2) stipend or compensation, and (3) the date they receive their acceptance and offer. The first factor aligns with previous findings, but the second and third factors demonstrate how the program administrator can influence the selection, which has not been previously observed.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0949-149X			WOS:000347642500006

IEEE					Topology Selection for Medium-Voltage Three-Phase SiC Solid-State Transformer								2014 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON RENEWABLE ENERGY RESEARCH AND APPLICATION (ICRERA)		International Conference on Renewable Energy Research and Applications						485	489					2014	2014	The first stage in the structure of a three-phase solid state transformer (SST) is a medium voltage active rectifier. Due to its relatively high voltage operating conditions, this rectifier requires careful topology selection for empirical implementation. In this paper, different topologies of active rectifiers are studied as candidates for the first stage in SSTs. The selected topologies are narrowed down to three most suitable topologies. Three selected topologies are the current source buck rectifier, the diode-clamped rectifier, and the series active filter. For comparison purposes, loss analysis of these three rectifiers is carried out using simulations and experimental implementation. In this study, for the sake of practicality and simplicity, 10 kV Silicon Carbide (SiC) MOSFETs and diodes are utilized to reduce the number of components in the multilevel structure of the rectifiers. Other than loss analysis, a new technique for capacitor voltage regulation for the series active filter topology is also proposed and experimentally verified. Considering the loss data and other issues such as line current total harmonic distortion (THD), it is concluded that the series active filter topology is the most suitable one for this application.					3rd THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE on RENEWABLE ENERGY RESEARCH and APPLICATIONS (ICRERA)3rd THE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE on RENEWABLE ENERGY RESEARCH and APPLICATIONS (ICRERA)	OCT 19-22, 2014OCT 19-22, 2014	Int Journal Renewable Energy Res (IJRER); IEEE; IEEE Ind Appl Soc (IAS); Pels; Iee; Ieej; KBSoftwareInt Journal Renewable Energy Res (IJRER); IEEE; IEEE Ind Appl Soc (IAS); Pels; Iee; Ieej; KBSoftware	Milwakuee, WIMilwakuee, WI	0	0	0	0	0	0			2377-6897		978-1-4799-3795-0	WOS:000380395200078		
J	Brown, Shane; Street, David; Martin, Julie P.								Engineering Student Social Capital in an Interactive Learning Environment								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION				30	4			813	821					2014	2014	College student access to resources has been shown to be important for learning, cognitive development, retention, and other outcomes. The framework of social capital, or resources embedded in social networks that are accessed by members of a network, captures the essence of this resource acquisition. One important source of social capital related to academic achievement is the interactive classroom environment, but social capital development in this setting has not been studied. The purpose of this research is to examine factors that influence social capital development in a setting where tutors are used in the lecture environment. Subject matter difficulty, approachability and accessibility of faculty and classroom environment were all factors that impacted students' choices related to accessing available social capital in this environment. Results can inform both social capital theory, in terms of development in an academic setting, and tutoring in comparable interactive learning environments.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0949-149X			WOS:000347457200006

We administered a "Name and Resource Generator'' instrument adapted from the field of sociology to a sample of 1,410 engineering undergraduates from five U. S. universities. Quantitative analysis of results revealed many statistically significant differences in the social capital characteristics and accessed resources for First Generation College students (FGC) compared to Continuing Generation College (CGC) students. While some of these results were theoretically anticipated, we also present unique findings regarding (1) the prevalence of available and accessed resources for FGC students, and (2) the type of individual (known as an "alter'') providing the engineering-related resources. The retrospective nature of the study allowed us to draw conclusions about the nature of these resources and alter types both during and before undergraduate engineering studies. These results represent a significant theoretical contribution that engineering education stakeholders can use to enhance outreach, recruitment and retention efforts to help grow and diversify the field.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0949-149X			WOS:000347457200007		
S	Yu, Lei; Shen, Haiying			IEEE					Bandwidth Guarantee under Demand Uncertainty in Multi-tenant Clouds								2014 IEEE 34TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING SYSTEMS (ICDCS 2014)		IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems						258	267		10.1109/ICDCS.2014.34			2014	2014	The shared multi-tenant nature of cloud network infrastructures has caused poor application performance in the clouds due to unpredictable network performance. To provide bandwidth guarantee, several virtual network abstractions have been proposed which allow the tenants to specify and reserve virtual clusters with required network bandwidth between the VMs. However, all of these existing proposals require the tenants to deterministically characterize the exact bandwidth demands in the abstractions, which can be difficult and result in inefficient bandwidth reservation due to the demand uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a virtual cluster abstraction with stochastic bandwidth requirements between VMs, called Stochastic Virtual Cluster (SVC), which probabilistically models the bandwidth demand uncertainty. Based on SVC, we propose a network sharing framework and efficient VM allocation algorithms to ensure that the bandwidth demands of tenants on any link are satisfied with a high probability, while minimizing the bandwidth occupancy cost on links. Using simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of SVC for accommodating cloud application workloads with highly volatile bandwidth demands, in the way of achieving the trade-off between the job concurrency and average job running time.					34th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)34th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)	JUN 30-JUL 03, 2014JUN 30-JUL 03, 2014	IEEE; IEEE Comp SocIEEE; IEEE Comp Soc	Madrid, SPAINMadrid, SPAIN	3	0	0	0	0	3			1063-6927		978-1-4799-5168-0	WOS:000346658200026

More and more internet sites are armed with dynamic (or live) content (such as live sports game statistics, e-commerce and online auction), and there is a need to deliver dynamic content freshly in scale. To achieve high scalability, the consistency maintenance problem for dynamic content (contents with frequent updates) served by CDNs is non-trivial. The large number of widely scattered replicas guarantee the service QoS of end-users, meanwhile largely increase the complexity of consistency maintenance. Current consistency maintenance infrastructures and methods cannot simultaneously satisfy the two requirements: scalability and consistency. In this paper, we first analyze our crawled trace data of a cached sports game content on thousands of content servers of a major CDN. We analyze the content consistency from different perspectives, from which we try to break down the reasons for inconsistency among content servers. Finally, we further evaluate the performance in consistency, scalability and overhead for different infrastructures with different update methods. We itemize the advantages and disadvantages of different methods and infrastructures in different scenarios through the evaluation. We aim to give guidance for appropriate selections of consistency maintenance infrastructures and methods for a CDN, and for choosing a CDN service with different considerations.					34th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)34th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)	JUN 30-JUL 03, 2014JUN 30-JUL 03, 2014	IEEE; IEEE Comp SocIEEE; IEEE Comp Soc	Madrid, SPAINMadrid, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0	0			1063-6927		978-1-4799-5168-0	WOS:000346658200027

As the number of users continued to grow, the bandwidth required to maintain acceptable quality of service (QoS) has greatly increased. Peer-to-peer (P2P) architectures have shown promise in reducing the bandwidth costs; however, the previous works build one P2P overlay for each video, which provides limited availability of video providers and produces high overlay maintenance overhead. To handle these problems, in this work, we novelly leverage the existing social network in YouTube, where a user subscribes to another user's channel to track all his uploaded videos. The subscribers of a channel tend to watch the channel's videos and common-interest nodes tend to watch the same videos. Also, the popularity of videos in one channel varies greatly. We study real trace data to confirm these properties. Based on these properties, we propose SocialTube that builds the subscribers of one channel into a P2P overlay and also clusters common-interest nodes in a higher level. It also incorporates a prefetching algorithm that prefetches higher-popularity videos. Extensive trace-driven simulation results and PlanetLab real-world experimental results verify the effectiveness of SocialTube at reducing server load and overlay maintenance overhead and at improving QoS for users.					34th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)34th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS)	JUN 30-JUL 03, 2014JUN 30-JUL 03, 2014	IEEE; IEEE Comp SocIEEE; IEEE Comp Soc	Madrid, SPAINMadrid, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0	0			1063-6927		978-1-4799-5168-0	WOS:000346658200030

IEEE					The Potentials for Spatial Audio to Convey Information in Virtual Environments								2014 IEEE VR WORKSHOP: SONIC INTERACTION IN VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS (SIVE)								31	34					2014	2014	Digital sounds can be processed such that auditory cues are created that convey spatial location within a virtual auditory environment (VAE). Only in recent years has technology advanced such that audio can be processed in real-time as a user navigates an environment. We must first consider the perceptual challenges faced by 3D sound rendering, before we can realize its full potential. Now more than ever before, large quantities of data are created and collected at an increasing rate. Research in human perception has demonstrated that humans are capable of differentiating among many sounds. One potential application is to create an auditory virtual world in which data is represented as various sounds. Such are presentation could aid data analysts in detecting patterns in data, decreasing cognitive load, and performing their jobs faster. Although this is one application, the full extent of the manner in which 3D sounds can be used to augment virtual environments has yet to be discovered.

The accuracy of drivers' judgments of the effects of headlight glare on their own visual acuity								PERCEPTION				43	11			1203	1213		10.1068/p7814			2014	2014	Drivers' judgments of the magnitude of disability glare caused by high-beam headlights may not match actual declines in visual performance. This study investigated younger and older drivers' beliefs about their own visual performance in the presence of headlight glare. Eleven older drivers and seventeen younger drivers judged the distance at which they would just be able to recognize the orientation of a white Landolt C if it were present adjacent to the headlamps of a stationary opposing vehicle at night. The younger participants were generally accurate in their estimates of the recognition distance of the stimulus, while older participants significantly overestimated both their own acuity and the effect of glare on their vision. From this study, we see that older drivers' judgments about the disabling effects of oncoming headlights may be systematically inaccurate. These misperceptions about headlight glare may help explain why drivers tend to underuse high beams.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0301-0066	1468-4233		WOS:000347269400005

In this paper, we start with some simple results, then establish bounds on the parameter especially for regular graphs and claw-free graphs. We also show that determining the parameter is NP-complete, and provide a linear-time algorithm for trees.									8	0	0	0	0	8			1607-3606	1727-933X		WOS:000346905700006

In this paper, the various modeled components are discussed, the implementation of the feed-forward control algorithm to prevent interface transformer saturation is presented, and finally, the results of a test scenario are shown with and without the saturation control algorithm in place.

Without a zero crossing, interrupted dc currents produce arcing and hence ac breakers would not be applicable. The z-source breaker resolves this problem because it is designed to turn off as soon as it experiences a sharp transient in current. In this paper a new design for the z-source breaker is considered so that load transients are not identified as faults. The design is also modified to accommodate bi-directionality which is required in medium-voltage dc ship power systems. A higher-level coordinated control scheme is discussed which enables multiple breakers to coordinate and isolate the fault in a simple medium-voltage dc ship power system architecture with a central control unit.

Study 1 consists of in-depth interviews with both newlyweds and empty nesters. Study 2 incorporates a survey design with 412 respondents; data is analyzed via structural equation modeling, multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and post hoc multiple comparison tests.Findings - Findings reveal that consumer appraisal of a transition event is a key predictor of response to marketing activities, and that consumers have an inverted-U shape response to advertising across three transition stages (anticipatory, liminal, re-established).Practical implications - Because appraisal is not generally captured by market research, companies may be able to estimate appraisal by combining resource availability information with existing demographic data. Because resources are found to be a significant predictor of appraisal, by anticipating resource levels, a firm may be able to estimate appraisal and thus be able to forecast advertising responsiveness.Originality/value - Researchers have not investigated how changes in the availability of time and other resources during life events affect consumers' appraisal of products, adaptation to new roles, or response to marketing efforts. As such, examining the influence of resources and transition stage on attitudes toward marketing activities during life transitions makes a meaningful contribution to the literature.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0736-3761			CCC:000332193100005

Diabetes, metabolic syndrome and obesity : targets and therapy				7				553	63		10.2147/DMSO.S72695			2014	2014	Obese sheep were used to assess the effects of palmitoleic (C16:1 cis-9) acid infusion on lipogenesis and circulating insulin levels. Infusion of 10 mg/kg body weight (BW)/day C16:1 intravenously in obese sheep reduced (P<0.01) weight gain by 77%. Serum palmitoleic levels increased (P<0.05) in a linear manner with increasing levels of C16:1 infusion. Cis-11 vaccenic (C18:1 cis-11) acid, a known elongation product of palmitoleic acid, was also elevated (P<0.05) in serum after 14 days and 21 days of infusion. Plasma insulin levels were lower (P<0.05) (10 mg/kg BW/day C16:1) than controls (0 mg/kg BW/day C16:1) at 14 days and 28 days of infusion. Infusion of C16:1 resulted in linear increases in tissue concentrations of palmitoleic, cis-11 vaccenic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosapentaenoic acids in a dose-dependent manner. Total lipid content of the semitendinosus (ST) muscle and mesenteric adipose tissue was reduced (P<0.01) in both 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg BW C16:1 dose levels. Total lipid content and mean adipocyte size in the longissimus muscle was reduced (P<0.05) in the 10 mg/kg BW C16:1 dose level only, whereas total lipid content and adipocyte size of the subcutaneous adipose tissue was not altered. Total lipid content of the liver was also unchanged with C16:1 infusion. Palmitoleic acid infusion upregulated (P<0.05) acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid elongase-6 (ELOVL6), and Protein kinase, AMP-activated, alpha 1 catalytic subunit, transcript variant 1 (AMPK) mRNA expressions in liver, subcutaneous adipose, and ST muscle compared to the controls. However, mRNA expression of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1b (CPT1B) differed between tissues. In the subcutaneous adipose and liver, C16:1 infusion upregulated (P<0.05) GLUT4 and CPT1B, whereas these genes were downregulated (P<0.05) in ST muscle with C16:1 infusion. These results show that C16:1 infusion for 28 days reduced weight gain, intramuscular adipocyte size and total lipid content, and circulating insulin levels. These changes appear to be mediated through alterations in expression of genes regulating glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation specifically in the muscles.									3	0	0	2	0	3				1178-7007		MEDLINE:25429233	25429233

The purpose of using it is to control the level of supply in order to ensure a fair level of returns to agricultural producers. A practice of using production restrictions has recently raised a lot of concerns among industry participants, lawyers and antitrust law enforcers in the U.S. The plaintiffs in a number of recent and on-going private antitrust lawsuits allege that agricultural production restrictions violate the Sherman Antitrust Act (1890). The article identifies and analyzes key legal and economic issues relevant to the nature and performance of agricultural supply management programs in the United States.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1559-2448			WOS:000346139400004

Quantifying Electronic and Ionic Conductivity Contributions in Carbon/Polyelectrolyte Composite Thin Films								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				161	14			H917	H923		10.1149/2.0621414jes			2014	2014	A method for independently obtaining electronic and ionic contributions to electrical conductivity in thin-film samples comprised of carbon black (CB) mixed with polymer electrolyte is reported. The method relies upon careful control of the nature of the contact between the sample and the current-carrying electrodes. Electronic conductivities are derived from currents obtained using electronically-conductive glassy carbon electrodes to contact the sample, whereas ionic conductivities are derived from currents obtained using ionically-conductive Nafion electrodes to contact the sample. Conditions under which the measured currents are free from interference from redox reactions at the electrodes and capacitive charging at electrode-electrolyte interfaces are discussed. Electrical conduction was studied in a series of composite carbon black/polymer samples under conditions of fixed temperature and variable relative humidity (RH). For samples containing 10-20 weight percent carbon black dispersed in Nafion, electronic conductivity was higher than ionic conductivity at all RH values tested (25-100% RH). Ionic conductivity increased with increasing RH in a manner consistent with expectation from prior studies on Nafion membranes, whereas electronic conductivity decreased with increasing RH due to water swelling and weakened electrical contacts among carbon particles in the network.

In this paper, an integrated SOC and SOH estimation scheme is presented that applies sliding modes on an electrochemical model for Li-ion battery cell. The electrochemical model is selected and progressively reduced to sufficiently describe the relevant temporal and spatial evolution of Li-ion concentration in each electrode. The proposed estimation scheme is comprised of three subestimators which work jointly: two separate adaptive sliding mode observers (SMO) for estimation of Li-ion concentration and film resistance, and a separate parameter estimator for the solid state diffusion coefficient of negative electrode. Convergence of the observers has been proven using Lyapunov's stability theory. Simulation results are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the overall scheme.					13th IEEE International Workshop on Variable Structure Systems (VSS)13th IEEE International Workshop on Variable Structure Systems (VSS)	JUN 29-JUL 02, 2014JUN 29-JUL 02, 2014	IEEE; CSS; IR CCYN; Gdr Macs; ECN; Nantes MetropoleIEEE; CSS; IR CCYN; Gdr Macs; ECN; Nantes Metropole	Nantes, FRANCENantes, FRANCE	0	0	0	0	0	0			2158-3978		978-1-4799-5566-4	WOS:000345902100047

DOWNHILL DOMINATION IN GRAPHS								DISCUSSIONES MATHEMATICAE GRAPH THEORY				34	3			603	612		10.7151/dmgt.1760			2014	2014	A path pi = (v(1), v(2), . . . , Vk+1) in a graph G = (V, E) is a downhill path if for every i, 1 <= i <= k, deg(v(i)) >= deg(v(i+ 1)), where deg(v(i)) denotes the degree of vertex v(i) is an element of V. The downhill domination number equals the minimum cardinality of a set S subset of V having the property that every vertex v is an element of V lies on a downhill path originating from some vertex in S. We investigate downhill domination numbers of graphs and give upper bounds. In particular, we show that the downhill domination number of a graph is at most half its order, and that the downhill domination number of a tree is at most one third its order. We characterize the graphs obtaining each of these bounds.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1234-3099	2083-5892		WOS:000345242100013

Pattern matching is arguably the most important and most computationally intensive component of a NIDS. Software-based NIDS implementations drop up to 90% of packets during increased network load even at lower network bandwidth. We propose an alternative hybrid-NIDS that couples an FPGA with a network adapter to provide hardware support for pattern matching and software support for post processing. The proposed system, SFAOENIDS, offers an extensible open-source NIDS for Solarflare AOE devices. The pattern matching engine-the primary component of the hardware architecture was designed based on the requirements of typical NIDS implementations. In testing on a real network environment, the SFAOENIDS hardware implementation, operating at 200 MHz, handles a 10Gbps data rate without dropping packets while simultaneously minimizing the server CPU load.

Most observers see Battery second use as an opportunity to maximize the value of the battery throughout an extended lifetime in order to offset the high costs of the battery system in an electric vehicle (EV) application. The viability (or combined economic and technical feasibility) of B2U depends on the battery design, use in the vehicle, reprocessing requirements, integration strategy, the secondary application, and the development of the battery market. Currently the uncertainty integrated along the entire value chain makes it difficult to assess the practicality of a secondary use strategy. We will shown that, with the current state of the market, only the vehicle OEM is capable of facilitating Battery second use strategy through the optimal design and development of the vehicle battery system. This paper will present of a method that extends the tools and information from the vehicle development to enhance the accuracy of current B2U evaluation methods. The method proposed could eventually be used for lifecycle optimization during the early development stages of an electric vehicle. Allowing the OEM to design the battery system and operational processes necessary to maximize the value of the battery system and mitigate the costs and associated with relatively new battery technologies.					5th International Conference on Sustainable Automotive Technologies (ICSAT)5th International Conference on Sustainable Automotive Technologies (ICSAT)	SEP 25-27, 2013SEP 25-27, 2013		Ingolstadt, GERMANYIngolstadt, GERMANY	0	0	0	0	0	0			2196-5544		978-3-319-01884-3; 978-3-319-01883-6	WOS:000345579300024

This is achieved by embedding source coils in the road and including a pickup coil inside the vehicle, these coils are coupled to get the maximum power transfer. From the point of view of the vehicle, dynamic wireless charging systems theoretically solve the Electric Vehicle (EV) battery problem by delivering unlimited range and making it possible to use smaller batteries, which reduce the cost and weight, however the implementation will be limited by the availability of the charging infrastructure, which in turn is limited by its cost. This paper presents a literature review on the recent advancements of stationary and dynamic wireless power transfer used for EV charging addressing power limitations, electromagnetic interference regulations, communication issues and interoperability, in order to point out the technology challenges to transition from stationary to dynamic wireless charging and the implementation challenges in terms of infrastructure.					5th International Conference on Sustainable Automotive Technologies (ICSAT)5th International Conference on Sustainable Automotive Technologies (ICSAT)	SEP 25-27, 2013SEP 25-27, 2013		Ingolstadt, GERMANYIngolstadt, GERMANY	7	0	0	0	0	7			2196-5544		978-3-319-01884-3; 978-3-319-01883-6	WOS:000345579300030

IEEE					EXPLOITING THE BASEBAND PHASE STRUCTURE OF THE VOICED SPEECH FOR SPEECH ENHANCEMENT								2014 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ACOUSTICS, SPEECH AND SIGNAL PROCESSING (ICASSP)		International Conference on Acoustics Speech and Signal Processing ICASSP												2014	2014	Performance of traditional speech enhancement techniques like spectral subtraction and log-Minimum Mean Squared Error Short Time Spectral Amplitude (log-MMSE STSA) estimation degrades in presence of highly non-stationary noises like babble noise. This is mainly due to inaccurate noise estimation during the voiced segment of the speech signal. In this paper, we propose to exploit the fine structure of the phase spectra of the voiced speech in the baseband STFT domain. This phase structure is used to detect the noise dominant frequency bins in the voiced frames. This information is used to achieve better non-stationary noise Power Spectral Density (PSD) estimation. Using this estimation, performance of spectral subtraction and log-MMSE STSA is improved overall by 0.3 and 0.2, respectively, in terms of Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ) measure over the original algorithms when noisy speech is used for pitch estimation. We also present the combination of these two algorithms (spectral subtraction and log-MMSE STSA) to achieve the overall PESQ improvement of 0.5 over standard log-MMSE STSA when accurate pitch estimation is available.

A primary feature of our methods is their elegance and ease of implementation - they can be coded in less space than is occupied by this abstract, and their lightweight footprint makes them ideally suited for highly resource-constrained computing environments. We demonstrate through empirical testing that these methods perform well in practice, and provide a complete theoretical analysis for our methods that offers valuable insight into the performance of a natural class of approximate selection algorithms based on hierarchical random sampling.					22nd Annual European Symposium on Algorithms (ESA) held as part of ALGO Meeting22nd Annual European Symposium on Algorithms (ESA) held as part of ALGO Meeting	SEP 08-10, 2014SEP 08-10, 2014		Wroclaw, POLANDWroclaw, POLAND	0	0	0	0	0	0			0302-9743		978-3-662-44777-2; 978-3-662-44776-5	WOS:000345502900026

However, the random change of polarization states along the optical fibers and the strong dependence on the materials and geometries of the optical waveguides are problematic for acquiring high quality interference signal. Meanwhile, difficulty in multiplexing has always been a bottleneck on the application scopes of OFIs. Here, we present a sensing concept of optical carrier based microwave interferometry (OCMI) by reading optical interferometric sensors in microwave domain. It combines the advantages from both optics and microwave. The low oscillation frequency of the microwave can hardly distinguish the optical differences from both modal and polarization dispersion making it insensitive to the optical waveguides/materials. The phase information of the microwave can be unambiguitly resolved so that it has potential in fully distributed sensing. The OCMI concept has been implemented in different types of interferometers (i.e., Michelson, Mach-Zehnder, Fabry-Perot) among different optical waveguides (i.e., singlemode, multimode, and sapphire fibers) with excellent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and low polarization dependence. A spatially continuous distributed strain sensing has been demonstrated.

The changes in refractive index near the resonator surface lead to the effective refractive index change and thus a shift at certain resonance wavelength. The high quality (Q) whispering gallery modes (WGMs) contributed by the rotationally symmetric structures will interact with the local circumstances through the evanescent field. The high sensitivity in detection was achieved by the long photon lifetime of the high-Q resonator (thus the long light-environment interaction path).In this paper, we present our recent research on using fiber pigtailed capillary coupler for WGM resonator excitation and its sensing applications. Capillary tube with wall thickness of several microns was used as the waveguide. The PMMA microsphere and porous glass microsphere (PGM) were integrated with the etched capillary tube for different sensing purposes. The Q-factors and free spectrum ranges (FSR) of different types of microspheres were measured by coupling light into the microsphere using novel fiber pigtailed capillary coupler. Chemical vapor at different concentrations were tested using PGM microresonator. This alignment free structure provides a new sensing probe based on WGM resonator concept.

Evaluation of driver steering preferences using an automotive simulator								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF VEHICLE DESIGN				66	2			124	142		10.1504/IJVD.2014.064548			2014	2014	A high fidelity steering simulator was developed and validated to support driver steering preference studies. The steering simulator was validated using in-vehicle test data and two pilot studies before application to a demographics-based driver preference study with 43 subjects. This latter study reflected the following trends: drivers who used their vehicles for utility purposes preferred faster steering ratios and heavier steering torque in residential, country, and highway environments. In contrast, car enthusiasts preferred fast steering ratios in residential and country environments and light steering torque on the highway. These relationships may be used to set steering targets, during future vehicle developments, to accurately match vehicles to their intended market segments.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0143-3369	1741-5314		WOS:000345243900002

Parametric studies, design of experiments (DOE), and sensitivity analyses are conducted with a hyper-viscoelastic finite element model to determine effects of design variables: i) the thickness of spokes; ii) the shear band thickness and iii) shear modulus of polyurethane (PU), on rolling resistance, vertical stiffness, and contact pressure. A response surface model is generated from DOE and is used to find optimum design values for minimising rolling resistance of an NPT under constraints on vertical deflection and contact pressure. Shear modulus of PU and the shear band thickness are the most important design parameters to affect rolling resistance, vertical stiffness, and contact pressure. The optimised values show that the NPT has low rolling resistance with a higher shear modulus of PU and a higher shear band thickness associated with a lower shear deformation while rolling.									1	1	0	0	0	2			0143-3369	1741-5314		WOS:000345243900005

Physical Activity Levels and Preferences of Ethnically Diverse Visitors to Georgia State Parks								JOURNAL OF LEISURE RESEARCH				46	5			540	562					2014	2014	Parks provide many outdoor recreation opportunities that encourage physical activity and healthy lifestyles, and research has recently begun to explore the demographic, social, and environmental factors associated with park-based activity levels, particularly outside of urban areas. This study used a mixed methods approach to investigate physical activity levels and correlates among demographically diverse state park visitors in Georgia. Data were collected during summer 2010 via onsite intercept surveys (n = 1,073) and structured observations of visitor behavior (n = 9,453 individuals observed). Analyses revealed substantial levels of activity during park visits and highlighted links between socially oriented recreation participation and park-based physical activity, particularly for Latinos and African Americans. Results could provide park managers with insightful information for promoting and sustaining park-based physical activity across diverse communities.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0022-2216	2159-6417		WOS:000345193700003

Mg0.25Zn0.75O nanorods are regrown when magnesium chloride hexahydrate is used as the solvent, because ZnCl2 and MgCl2 vapors are generated under these conditions. The near-band-edge emission intensity of the Mg0.25Zn0.75O nanorods is enhanced by VC-FTFA by a factor of 37 compared to that of the films annealed in open air at 700 degrees C. Our method may provide a route for the facile fabrication of Mg0.25Zn0.75O nanorods.									5	0	0	0	0	5			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000344998700016

The operation of a practitioner-oriented seminar is examined through a theatrical lens to establish the extent to which direction, audience participation and creativity, emotions and visual aesthetics can contribute to bridging the academia-practitioner divide.Findings-Planning a practitioner-oriented seminar performance is as important as planning the program content. Effective knowledge transfer requires active audience engagement, activation of favorable audience emotions and an enjoyable learning process. The lack of these requirements can render written dissemination by journal papers relatively ineffective in reaching and engaging practitioners.Research limitations/implications-Findings are based on one case study: a seminar delivered to practitioners on "service theater".Practical implications-In addition to face-to-face seminars, contemporary dissemination methods (webinars, podcasts) can apply the theatrical lessons introduced and evaluated. Practitioners do not respond positively to only written declarative information, through academic papers and/or PowerPoint slides, from academicians.Originality/value-The article recognizes that dissemination of service research findings is, itself, a service, requiring depth of thought and understanding.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0887-6045			WOS:000345149300006

Suppression of sub-surface freezing in free-standing thin films of a coarse-grained model of water								PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS				16	47			25916	25927		10.1039/c4cp03948c			2014	2014	Freezing in the vicinity of water-vapor interfaces is of considerable interest to a wide range of disciplines, most notably the atmospheric sciences. In this work, we use molecular dynamics and two advanced sampling techniques, forward flux sampling and umbrella sampling, to study homogeneous nucleation of ice in free-standing thin films of supercooled water. We use a coarse-grained monoatomic model of water, known as mW, and we find that in this model a vapor-liquid interface suppresses crystallization in its vicinity. This suppression occurs in the vicinity of flat interfaces where no net Laplace pressure in induced. Our free energy calculations reveal that the pre-critical crystalline nuclei that emerge near the interface are thermodynamically less stable than those that emerge in the bulk. We investigate the origin of this instability by computing the average asphericity of nuclei that form in different regions of the film, and observe that average asphericity increases closer to the interface, which is consistent with an increase in the free energy due to increased surface-to-volume ratios.									19	0	0	4	0	19			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000345208200029	25354427

The CDS based approach reduces the search for a minimum cost path between a source and destination terminals to the set of terminals forming the backbone network. Researchers over the years have developed numerous distributed and localized algorithms for constructing CDSs which minimize the number of terminals forming the backbone or which provide multiple source-destination paths between each pair of terminals. However none of this research focuses on minimizing the load at the bottleneck terminal of the backbone network constructed by the CDS algorithms. A terminal becomes a bottleneck if the offered traffic load is greater than its effective transmission rate. In this paper we analyze the load based performance of a CDS algorithm and a k-connected k-dominating set (k-CDS) algorithm and compare it with our centralized algorithm which has been designed to minimize the load at the bottleneck terminals of the backbone network. We verify the effectiveness of our algorithm by simulating a large number of random test networks.					33rd Annual IEEE Military Communications Conference on Affordable Mission Success - Meeting the Challenge (MILCOM)33rd Annual IEEE Military Communications Conference on Affordable Mission Success - Meeting the Challenge (MILCOM)	OCT 06-08, 2014OCT 06-08, 2014	IEEE; IEEE Comp Soc; IEEE Commun Soc; AFCEAIEEE; IEEE Comp Soc; IEEE Commun Soc; AFCEA	Raytheon, Baltimore, MDRaytheon, Baltimore, MD	0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-7578		978-1-4799-6770-4	WOS:000369851400184

The additional B-site doping of A-site doped STO results in increased electrical conductivity, but at the expense of Seebeck coefficient. However, doping on both sites of the STO lattice significantly reduces the lattice thermal conductivity of STO by adding more densely and strategically distributed phononic scattering centers that attack wider phonon spectra. The additional B-site doping limits the trade-off relationship between the electrical conductivity and total thermal conductivity of A-site doped STO, leading to an improvement in the room-temperature thermoelectric figure of merit, ZT. The 5% Pr3+ and 20% Nb5+ double-doped STO film exhibits the best ZT of 0.016 at room temperature.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000344470400020

To glean further insight, we conduct a survey and extract themes from citizen comments and government's response. We conclude with recommendations on how practitioners can develop social media strategies that enable citizen participation in emergency management.					47th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences47th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences	JAN 06-09, 2014JAN 06-09, 2014	Univ Hawaii, Shidler Coll Business; IEEE Comp SocUniv Hawaii, Shidler Coll Business; IEEE Comp Soc	Waikoloa, HIWaikoloa, HI	2	0	0	0	0	2			1060-3425		978-1-4799-2504-9	WOS:000343806602010

Comparison of hazard area and casualty predictions of a small-scale chemical attack using various toxic load toxicity models								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT AND POLLUTION				54	2-4			222	232		10.1504/IJEP.2014.065123			2014	2014	It has been observed that the toxic load model can better account for toxic effects from chemical exposures than Haber's law. However, the toxic load model has been experimentally validated only for steady exposures. We compare four proposed extensions of the toxic load model to the case of time-varying exposures. We conclude that the choice of the toxic load model can be important in consequence assessment studies that use realistic time-varying toxic exposures.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0957-4352	1741-5101		WOS:000343369400014

Seed Removal by an Introduced Scatter-hoarder on a Caribbean Island								CARIBBEAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE				48	1			9	17					2014	2014	The introduction of non-native seed dispersers has the potential to significantly alter distributions and relative abundances of native plants. Although effects of introduced seed predators have been documented, little is known about how introduced dispersers influence seed movement patterns. We investigated seed removal of seven rainforest species on the island of Dominica in the Lesser Antilles by the entire seed-remover community and specifically by the Red-rumped Agouti, Dasyprocta leporina, a scatter-hoarding rodent introduced to the island approximately 2500 years ago. We recorded removal rates in three regions of Dominica from 168 experimentally placed seed groups containing a total of 1356 seeds. Seed groups were either accessible to the entire seed-remover community or placed within exclosures designed to exclude agoutis. Within 13 days, 47 percent and 28 percent of seeds had been removed from control groups and agouti exclosure groups, respectively, leading to 19 percent of seed removal being attributed to agoutis. Species with smaller seeds were preferentially taken by seed removers other than agoutis, whereas agoutis were responsible for the majority of the removal of larger-seeded species. Seed removal was greater in areas with higher regional conspecific adult densities regardless of treatment, but agoutis had a greater impact relative to other seed removers on the seed removal of the study's rarest species. The results of this study highlight the potential impacts that introduced dispersers may have on native plant communities and call for further study of disperser introductions worldwide.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0008-6452			WOS:000343782100002

The p-ZnO nanowires were grown by electrochemical deposition method. It is suggested that the p-type conductivity first of all is connected with the zinc vacancies VZn. The clear rectifying behavior was observed on the currentvoltage curve of the ZnO p-n homojunction. The broad electroluminescence (EL) emission bands in the blue, green and red regions lead to observation of the white light by a naked eye under forward bias. The intrinsic defects such as Zni, VZn, Vo and Oi would be responsible for occurrence of these bands. (C) 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

S	Chen, Kang; Shen, Haiying						Kadar, I		A Social-Based Cyber-Physical System For Distributed Message Transmission								SIGNAL PROCESSING, SENSOR/INFORMATION FUSION, AND TARGET RECOGNITION XXIII		Proceedings of SPIE		9091						90911M	10.1117/12.2050163			2014	2014	The explosive increase of the availability of personal mobile devices has brought about a significant amount of peer-to-peer communication opportunities upon their encountering, which can be exploited to realize distributed message transmission among mobile devices. However, the opportunistic encountering among mobile devices, which is determined by the mobility of their holders, has introduced great difficulties on efficiently transmitting a message to its designated destination. Actually, people usually present a certain pattern on daily mobility. Further, device holders often belong to a certain social network community. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a social-based cyber-physical system for distributed message transmission, namely SocMessaging, by integrating both the mobility pattern and the social network of device holders. When selecting an encountered node for message relay, in addition to the node's historical encountering records with the destination node, SocMessaging also considers its social closeness with the destination node. Then, the message is always transmitted to the node that is most likely to meet its destination. As a result, SocMessaging closely connects the cyber world (i.e., network), physical world (i.e., people) and social network (i.e., social connection). Finally, our experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed system in message transmission between device holders.

A well-developed Q&A system should provide high question response rate, low response delay and good answer quality. Previous works use reputation systems to achieve the goals. However, these reputation systems evaluate a user with an overall rating for all questions the user has answered regardless of the question categories, thus the reputation score cannot accurately reflect the user's ability to answer a question in a specific category. In this paper, we propose TrustQ, a category reputation based Q&A System. TrustQ evaluates users' willingness and capability to answer questions in different categories. Considering a user has different willingness to answer questions from different users, TrustQ lets each node evaluate the reputation of other nodes answering its own questions. User a calculates user b's final reputation by considering both user a's direct rating and the indirect ratings on user b from other nodes. The reputation values facilitate forwarding a question to potential answerers, which improves the question response rate, response delay and answer quality. Our trace-driven simulation on PeerSim demonstrates the effectiveness of TrustQ in providing good user experience in terms of response rate and latency, and the answer quality.

A McAfee report shows that eight out of ten Critical Infrastructure Providers (CIPs) surveyed had a significant Distributed DoS (DDoS) attack in 2010.(1) Researchers proposed many approaches for detecting these attacks in the past decade. Anomaly based DoS detection is the most common. In this approach, the detector uses statistical features; such as the entropy of incoming packet header fields like source IP addresses or protocol type. It calculates the observed statistical feature and triggers an alarm if an extreme deviation occurs. However, intrusion detection systems (IDS) using entropy based detection can be fooled by spoofing. An attacker can sniff the network to collect header field data of network packets coming from distributed nodes on the Internet and fuses them to calculate the entropy of normal background traffic. Then s/he can spoof attack packets to keep the entropy value in the expected range during the attack. In this study, we present a proof of concept entropy spoofing attack that deceives entropy based detection approaches. Our preliminary results show that spoofing attacks cause significant detection performance degradation.

The fundamental premise of the theory is the establishment of an weak itinerant antiferromagnetic order in the ground state, a spin alignment favored in the minimum-energy many-body state when the Coulomb interaction is considered. The transport in this state is modeled by using the solutions of a Boltzmann equation obtained within the relaxation time approximation. We show that when scattering on magnetic impurities is introduced, the energy dependence of the relaxation time enhances the value of the thermoelectric coefficient for both charge and spin currents. An estimate of the effect is provided for the case of a standard In As quantum well and its variation with the strength of the magnetic scattering is studied.

Urban intersections face serious congestion problems, but the installation and maintenance of centralized systems is deemed cumbersome. A decentralized approach that is relatively simple to implement is studied. The recently proposed maximum pressure controller, demonstrated to stabilize queues in arterial traffic systems, is tested in simulations. Modifications of the controller are analyzed and compared under the same demand scenarios. The mesoscopic model used for the simulation experiments is an extended version of the store-and-forward model and emulates the arterial traffic network as a queuing system. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the maximum pressure algorithm, which, under certain conditions, can stabilize all queues in the system.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0361-1981	2169-4052		WOS:000343793400015

Double, ML; MacDonald, WL		Adapting Chestnut Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms for Use in Breeding								V INTERNATIONAL CHESTNUT SYMPOSIUM		Acta Horticulturae		1019				105	112					2014	2014	The goal of the American Chestnut Foundation (TACF) is the restoration of the American chestnut as a viable species to its native range. Toward that end, TACF is using conventional backcross breeding to introgress blight resistance from Chinese into American chestnut. The identification of species-specific molecular genetic markers could potentially accelerate recovery of the American type by permitting selection against Chinese chestnut genes not associated with disease resistance, and identifying pairings of hybrid trees that can produce progeny with a higher proportion of American genetic background than expected by chance. Therefore, we examined genotypes of forty-six Chinese and forty-nine American chestnut trees using a GoldenGateBeadArray (Illumina) of American chestnut single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and identified eighteen SNPs with strongly divergent allele frequencies in the two species. The web-based Allele-Specific Primer (WASP) designing tool successfully designed primers for fifteen of these eighteen SNPs. The corresponding sequences from American and Chinese chestnut were aligned to each other to identify potential problems in primer sites and aligned to peach or apple genomic sequence to identify likely intron positions that might interfere with amplification. The fifteen WASP primer sets were tested on a panel of two American, one interspecific F-1, and three Chinese chestnut trees. Twelve primer sets amplified an allele from American and hybrid but not from Chinese chestnut trees (allele potentially specific to American chestnut). Of these twelve, three also amplified an allele from Chinese and hybrid but not American chestnut (allele potentially specific to Chinese chestnut). For general use, species specificity of these alleles will need to be validated in a larger panel of both American and Chinese chestnut trees. However, for immediate use in the TACF breeding program, these alleles only need to differentiate the Chinese (resistance sources) and American chestnut parents (recurrent parents) used in the current backcross generations.					5th International Chestnut Symposium5th International Chestnut Symposium	SEP 04-08, 2012SEP 04-08, 2012	Int Soc Hort SciInt Soc Hort Sci	Shepherdstown, WVShepherdstown, WV	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-94-62610-06-4	WOS:000343859900016

Therefore, breeding for resistance to both pathogens simultaneously is essential before the American chestnut can be restored to its full native range. Using combined genetic and genomic approaches, resistance to C. parasitica (Cp) has been mapped to three quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in chestnut. In addition, a marker set covering the chestnut genome has been generated for implementation in breeding for Cp resistance. Although P. cinnamomi was introduced to the USA far earlier than C. parasitica, an effort to breed for resistance to this pathogen has been initiated only recently. Selection of parental genotypes with a high inter-generational transmission rate of resistance to P. cinnamomi (Pc) allowed initiation of genetic studies. In pilot experiments with a limited number of progeny derived from AdairKY1 x GL158, a QTL for resistance (source Chinese chestnut, C. mollissima 'Nanking') to Pc was mapped to linkage group E (LG_ E). Subsequently, three backcross families (HB1, HB2, and MK5) were selected from another source of resistance (C. mollissima 'Mahogany') for map construction and association analysis with 22 markers from LG_ E. Our preliminary analyses confirmed the presence of a Pc resistance QTL on LG_ E. In 2012, extended mapping populations (up to 200 individuals) representing the Mahogany and Nanking lineages of resistance were planted for phenotyping of Pc resistance and QTL mapping. Together, these materials and analyses should help resolve the location of the QTLs for resistance to Pc and test their co-location between two important sources of resistance in chestnut.					5th International Chestnut Symposium5th International Chestnut Symposium	SEP 04-08, 2012SEP 04-08, 2012	Int Soc Hort SciInt Soc Hort Sci	Shepherdstown, WVShepherdstown, WV	1	0	0	1	0	1			0567-7572		978-94-62610-06-4	WOS:000343859900040

Cancer informatics				13	Suppl 5			49	59		10.4137/CIN.S14070			2014	2014	We used gene co-expression network analysis to functionally annotate long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and identify their potential cancer associations. The integrated microarray data set from our previous study was used to extract the expression profiles of 1,865 lncRNAs. Known cancer genes were compiled from the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer and UniProt databases. Co-expression analysis identified a list of previously uncharacterized lncRNAs that showed significant correlation in expression with core cancer genes. To further annotate the lncRNAs, we performed a weighted gene co-expression network analysis, which resulted in 37 co-expression modules. Three biologically interesting modules were analyzed in depth. Two of the modules showed relatively high expression in blood and brain tissues, whereas the third module was found to be downregulated in blood cells. Hub lncRNA genes and enriched functional annotation terms were identified within the modules. The results suggest the utility of this approach as well as potential roles of uncharacterized lncRNAs in leukemia and neuroblastoma.									6	1	0	6	0	7						MEDLINE:25392693	25392693

In particular, the influence of distal traits tied to social activity has not been incorporated into the nomological network surrounding information technology (IT) use. Addressing this literature gap, the authors develop their research model using Social Cognitive Theory and examine how two distal traits, social aversion (SA) and institution-based trust (TRIT), influence computer self-efficacy (CSE) and other proximal state-like differences related to IT use. The authors' results show that SA and TRIT demonstrated influence on CSE and CA at the general and specific levels of analysis, and that CSE mediates the influence of SA and TRIT on PU and PEOU, yet does not fully mediate the influence of CA on PU and PEOU. The implications of their findings for research and practice are discussed, as well as avenues for future research.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1546-2234	1546-5012		WOS:000343388600001		
J	Shuai, Cijun; Zhuang, Jingyu; Peng, Shuping; Wen, Xuejun								Inhibition of phase transformation from beta- to alpha-tricalcium phosphate with addition of poly (L-lactic acid) in selective laser sintering								RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL				20	5			369	376		10.1108/RPJ-03-2013-0037			2014	2014	Purpose - The paper aims to fabricate an alpha-tricalcium phosphate (TCP) scaffold with an interconnected porous structure via selective laser sintering (SLS). To inhibit the phase transformation from beta- to alpha-TCP in fabrication process of porous scaffolds, a small amount (1 weight per cent) of poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA) is added into beta-TCP powder to introduce the transient liquid phase.Design/methodology/approach - The paper opted for the transient liquid phase of melting PLLA to decrease the sintering temperature in SLS. Meanwhile, the densification of beta-TCP is enhanced with a combined effect of the capillary force caused by melting PLLA and the surface energy of beta-TCP particles. Moreover, the PLLA will gradually decompose and completely disappear with laser irradiation.Findings - The testing results show the addition of PLLA enables the scaffolds to achieve a higher beta-TCP content of 77 +/- 1.49 weight per cent compared with the scaffold sintered from beta-TCP powder (60 +/- 1.65 weight per cent), when the laser energy density is 0.4 J/mm(2). The paper provides the mechanism of PLLA inhibition on the phase transformation from beta- to alpha-TCP. And the optimum sintering parameters are obtained based on experimental results, which are used to prepare a TCP scaffold with an interconnected porous structure via SLS.Research limitations/implications - This paper shows that the laser energy density is an important sintering parameter that can provide the means to control the micro-porous structure of the scaffold. If the laser energy density is too low, the densification is not enough. On the other hand, if the laser energy density is too high, the microcracks are observed which are attributed to the volume expansion during the phase transformation from beta- to alpha-TCP. Therefore, the laser energy density must be optimized.Originality/value - The paper provides a feasible method for fabricating TCP artificial bone scaffold with good biological and mechanical properties.									3	1	0	0	0	4			1355-2546	1758-7670		WOS:000343402000005

Advances in orthopedics				2014				178156	178156		10.1155/2014/178156			2014	2014	Evidence for selecting the same total knee arthroplasty prosthesis whether the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is retained or resected is rarely documented. This study reports prospective midterm clinical, radiographic, and functional outcomes of a fixed-bearing design implanted using two different surgical techniques. The PCL was completely retained in 116 knees and completely resected in 43 knees. For the entire cohort, clinical knee (96 ± 7) and function (92 ± 13) scores and radiographic outcomes were good to excellent for 84% of patients after 5-10 years in vivo. Range of motion averaged 124° ± 9°, with 126 knees exhibiting ≥120° flexion. Small differences in average knee flexion and function scores were noted, with the PCL-resected group exhibiting an average of 5° more flexion but an average function score that was 7 points lower compared to the PCL-retained group. Fluoroscopic analysis of 33 knees revealed stable tibiofemoral translations. This study demonstrates that a TKA articular design with progressive congruency in the lateral compartment can provide for femoral condyle rollback in maximal flexion activities and achieve good clinical and functional performance in patients with PCL-retained and PCL-resected TKA. This TKA design proved suitable for use with either surgical technique, providing surgeons with the choice of maintaining or sacrificing the PCL.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2090-3464			MEDLINE:25374697	25374697

This paper details three optimization strategies that can be used to minimize the energy consumption of PHEVs further through an information exchange between PHEVs and infrastructure agents supported by connected vehicle technology (CVT). An earlier study focused on a freeway scenario. The study reported here developed strategies for an urban scenario with frequent stop-and-go conditions. Three strategies were considered on the basis of different types of information availability with the use of CVT. Only signal timing information was available in Strategy 1; only headway information was available in Strategy 2; and both signal timing and headway information were available in Strategy 3. The performance of PHEVs that received no real-time information was used as the base case for Strategies 1, 2, and 3 to evaluate each strategy. The optimization strategies resulted in energy consumption savings that ranged from 60% to 76%. An analysis, with various levels of penetration of CVT-supported PHEVs in traffic, was conducted to demonstrate the impact of these optimization strategies with their increased market share. For a case study network, a linear trend was found between energy savings and the penetration rate of CVT-supported PHEVs. Strategy 3, in which signal timing and headway data were provided to CVT-supported PHEVs, resulted in about 31% to 35% energy savings, with a 30% penetration of CVT-supported PHEVs at the peak hour volume.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0361-1981	2169-4052		WOS:000343070200004

However, the Southeast has probably significant potential to grow. In this work, a GIS based site-suitability analysis is performed to assess the feasible areas for a utility-scale PV deployment in four states with high population growth and good solar insolation. Besides the feasible areas, technical potential and capacity factors are also calculated. The results, together with newly established criteria, are used in a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) established for a PV power plant. The MCDA is conducted to have a better understanding on how to prioritize development based on natural resource potential, technical feasibility but also economic factors such as solar incentives and installation costs.					40th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference (PVSC)40th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference (PVSC)	JUN 08-13, 2014JUN 08-13, 2014	IEEE; Electron Devices Soc; IEEE Photon Soc; IEEE Power & Energy Soc; Reliabil Soc; IEEE USAIEEE; Electron Devices Soc; IEEE Photon Soc; IEEE Power & Energy Soc; Reliabil Soc; IEEE USA	Denver, CODenver, CO	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4799-4398-2	WOS:000366638901049

The toxicity of PV modules is an indicator of potential environmental impacts associated with their disposal in landfills. Because solar energy is perceived as a green technology, it is important to ensure that harmful end-of-life issues, such as the generation of large amounts of e-waste, will not be detrimental to its long-term success. Procedures are developed for preparing samples for extraction tests, including EPA Method 1311 and California W.E.T. and modifications to them, which are performed on different types of PV modules. Sample preparation procedures and leaching test results will be discussed, including their implications for future testing and development of new regulatory methods. The results from the leaching tests are not meant to be representative of all currently available modules but are useful for examining the appropriateness of the current regulatory methods and for providing insight for development of proper end-of-life procedures for either recycling of valuable material or safe disposal of waste. This enables us to take a positive step towards avoiding the e-waste problem with regard to photovoltaic modules and continue the current trends of high growth rates and continuous cost reduction.					40th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference (PVSC)40th IEEE Photovoltaic Specialists Conference (PVSC)	JUN 08-13, 2014JUN 08-13, 2014	IEEE; Electron Devices Soc; IEEE Photon Soc; IEEE Power & Energy Soc; Reliabil Soc; IEEE USAIEEE; Electron Devices Soc; IEEE Photon Soc; IEEE Power & Energy Soc; Reliabil Soc; IEEE USA	Denver, CODenver, CO	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4799-4398-2	WOS:000366638901144		
J	Sundberg-Anderson, R. K.; Saylor, J. R.								Mesler entrainment in alcohols								EXPERIMENTS IN FLUIDS				55	1					1653	10.1007/s00348-013-1653-9			JAN 2014	2014	Mesler entrainment has been studied extensively in water and, more recently, in silicone oils. Studies of Mesler entrainment in liquids other than these are rare. The extant experimental results in water show significant irreproducibility both in the qualitative characteristics of Mesler entrainment and in the existence or nonexistence of Mesler entrainment when, for example, drops of the same diameter are released from the same height. In contrast, in silicone oils, Mesler entrainment is highly reproducible, essentially occurring either all of the time, or none of the time for a given set of conditions. A goal of the present work was to determine which of these two behaviors is the "standard'' behavior-that is, to determine whether Mesler entrainment is typically repeatable or not. The experimental studies presented herein were conducted in three liquids that have not been the subject of detailed investigation to date: ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, and methyl alcohol. All of these alcohol results showed behavior very similar to that observed in silicone oils, suggesting that Mesler entrainment is typically repeatable and that water is an atypical fluid, causing irreproducible results. Additionally, we present data obtained in silicone oils and combine that with the alcohol data in an attempt to develop a combination of dimensionless groups that predicts the boundaries within which Mesler entrainment occurs for liquids other than water.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0723-4864	1432-1114		WOS:000332151400023

Several research studies in the past decade have documented the difficulties that undergraduate, and even graduate students, encounter when trying to propose mechanisms using the EPF. An examination of this work suggests the emergence of a preliminary, but coherent, picture of students' strategies and difficulties with using electron-pushing to solve a variety of organic chemistry tasks. The first two sections of this paper, I present (1) two factors that may underlie several of the students' difficulties as presented in the organic chemistry education research literature; and (2) a model of how students approach solving mechanism tasks using the EPF. This paper concludes with a section on potential implications for instruction and a set of research questions arising from this analysis that have yet to be answered.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1109-4028			WOS:000343036600016

As an individual's health changes with age, their ability to consistently perform standard gestures may decrease, particularly towards the end of life. Thus, such interfaces will need to be capable of learning commands which are not choreographed ahead of time by the system designers. This circumstance illustrates the need for a system which engages in lifelong learning and is capable of discerning new gestures and the user's desired response to them. This paper describes an innovative approach to lifelong learning based on clustered gesture representations identified through the Growing Neural Gas algorithm. The simulated approach utilizes a user-generated reward signal to progressively refine the response of an assistive robot toward a preferred goal configuration.					16th International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)16th International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)	JUN 22-27, 2014JUN 22-27, 2014		Heraklion, GREECEHeraklion, GREECE	0	0	0	0	0	0			0302-9743		978-3-319-07230-2; 978-3-319-07229-6	WOS:000342751800019

This research was carried out to determine whether phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or organ preservation solutions would preserve both the extracellular matrix and chondrocytes of articular cartilage better than culture medium during refrigerated storage in the time frame that cartilage is stored for clinical use. Porcine cartilage plugs were stored, without the underlying bone, in culture medium with and without fetal bovine serum (FBS), PBS, Belzer's and Unisol solutions for 1 month at 4 degrees C. Metabolic activity was tested using a resazurin reduction method, and matrix permeability was evaluated by measuring electrical conductivity. Storage in culture medium with 10% FBS was shown to provide good cartilage metabolic function for 7 days, decreasing to about 36% after 1 month of storage. There was no significant difference between samples stored in culture medium with and without FBS after 1 month of storage (p = 0.5005). Refrigerated storage of cartilage in PBS and two different solutions ( Belzer's and Unisol) designed for optimal refrigerated tissue and organ storage results in loss of chondrocyte function and retention of matrix permeability. In contrast, the opposite, namely significantly better retention of chondrocyte function and loss of matrix permeability, was observed with culture medium. Future research should be focused on combining retention of chondrocyte function and matrix permeability by storage solution formulation. (C) 2014 S.

S	Dragic, Peter D.; Ballato, John; Hawkins, Thomas						Dubinskii, M; Post, SG		Compositional tuning of glass for the suppression of nonlinear and parasitic fiber laser phenomena								LASER TECHNOLOGY FOR DEFENSE AND SECURITY X		Proceedings of SPIE		9081						UNSP 908109	10.1117/12.2052959			2014	2014	Fiber lasers are susceptible to a number of nonlinear and parasitic effects that can significantly inhibit performance. From a system perspective, requirements of a fiber laser may cover average or peak power, amplitude stability, and spectral content of the source. Nonlinear and parasitic phenomena, including Brillouin scattering, Raman scattering, mode stability, self-phase modulation, four-wave mixing in multi-wavelength lasers, etc. can each influence one or all of these performance characteristics. Conventionally, these system-limiting undesirables have been addressed with complex waveguide designs. However, each of these light-medium interactions can be described by material coefficients that lead to estimates of 'threshold' values where these phenomena become significant. For example, this may be the Brillouin gain coefficient for Brillouin scattering, the nonlinear refractive index, n(2), for self-phase modulation, or the thermo-optic coefficient, dn/dT, for mode stability. Furthermore, these coefficients tend to be strong functions of the material, and surprisingly wide ranges of values exist between known material systems. For example, both the Pockels' photoelastic constant, p(12), and thermo-optic coefficient may be either positive or negative for a material. It follows logically that mixtures of materials with coefficients of opposing signs would then give rise to compositions where these coefficients may be zero. Example of such effect negation may include the barium aluminosilicate system for p(12) and the phosphosilicate or titanosilicate system for dn/dT. Compositional tailoring of the optical fiber is therefore suggested as an alternative means to suppressing these parasitics, and methods to do so will be discussed at the conference.

Large-mode-area fibers have been used to mitigate this limit, such as the leakage channel fiber (LCF). The mode intensity profile in these fibers typically exhibits Gaussian-like structure with much reduced effective mode-area compared to the physical fiber core area. Thus, a flat-top mode with a uniform intensity distribution is more suitable for larger effective mode-area without having to increase core size. In this work, we demonstrate the first flat-top mode generated in a 50 mu m-core Yb-doped LCF fiber. The mode flattening from Gaussian beam to a flat-top one is achieved by using a 30 mu m uniform Yb-doped area in the core center with a refractive index very slightly below that of the background silica glass by 2x10(-4). The resulting flat-top mode has a significantly increased effective mode area of similar to 1880 um(2), which is similar to 50% larger than that of a conventional uniform core and similar to 6 times the effective mode area of the flat-top mode record demonstrated previously. A 6m-long fiber is also tested in a laser configuration with a slope efficiency of similar to 84% at 1026 nm with respect to the absorbed pump power at 976 nm.

The material used to fabricate this scaffold, the manner in which the material is assembled, the evolution of the material over time, the biocompatibility or cellular affinity of the material, and the mechanical properties of the material are all degrees-of-freedom that the organ designer must use. Rapid-prototyping techniques provide additional design options to exploit biomaterials to create unique scaffold co-nfigurations and cofabricate cellular and acellular components. The promise of 3D organs is thus linked to managing the material design and assembly process.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2049-9485		978-0-85709-721-7; 978-0-85709-599-2	WOS:000341778100009

However, there is little capability to build a sustainable society without an informed, active, and engaged populous. This requires more than just environmentally knowledgeable citizens. It requires a society that understands the principles of the environment and can also exemplify them in daily life. In order to create a more environmentally literate world, there has been a push for environmental education integrated into schools. This qualitative study sought to examine Kenyan teachers' perspectives on the human-nature interaction by conducting vignette focus-group interviews. It is a subject not widely explored but vital for conservation not only in this area, but also other areas that seek to have an ecological informed populous. The vignettes were created using photographs and explanations of the photographs that the participants collected and emailed to the authors. For the focus-group vignette interviews, there were a total of 55 participants (30 females and 25 males). After InVivo analysis, we had 6 codes (resentment, pride, perils, blame, pragmatism, and self-interested) within 3 major themes. This study has implications for informing science education to combat these traditions of subjecting students to a science curriculum that demotes Kenyan cultural heritage and lifestyle. By incorporating local knowledge such as the ideas discussed in this paper into Kenyan science education, Kenyans can reach one of most challenging objectives of education, which is to produce children who are fundamentally aware of their environment.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0950-0693	1464-5289		WOS:000341975900006

The pi-conjugated segments in the two polymers were comprised of p-(2,5-dialkoxyphenylene)vinylene, p-phenylenevinylene and 2,7-carbazole subunits. Additionally, each m-pyridylene unit is enshrouded within a steric cleft provided by 2,6-diaryl substitution of the pyridyl ring, thus minimizing inter-chain interactions of these sites. The concentration-dependence of photophysical characteristics along with small angle neutron scattering (SANS) was employed to resolve solution aggregation properties and atomic force microscopy was employed to assess the surface morphology of polymer films.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000342180200017

Although a relative state space has been previously discounted, we show that such a state space is actually extremely powerful, able to achieve recognizable results after just one iteration. The power behind the technique (called POReSS) is the coupling between parameters that causes the orientation of one node to affect the position and orientation of other nodes. At the same time, the approach is fast because, like the more popular incremental state space, the Jacobian never needs to be explicitly computed. Furthermore, we show that while POReSS is able to quickly compute a solution near the global optimum, it is not precise enough to perform the fine adjustments necessary to reach the global minimum. As a result, we augment POReSS with a fast variant of Gauss-Seidel (called Graph-Seidel) on a global state space to allow the solution to settle closer to the global minimum. We show that this combination of POReSS and Graph-Seidel converges more quickly and scales to very large graphs better than other techniques while at the same time computing a competitive residual.

Laminar bottom gravity currents: friction factor-Reynolds number relationship								JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC RESEARCH				52	4			545	558		10.1080/00221686.2013.878402			2014	2014	This study elucidates a relationship between the Fanning friction factor and the Reynolds number for the laminar propagation of constant-flux gravity currents. The particular motivation for this study was related to the pipeline disposal of dredged fluid-mud where non-Newtonian bottom gravity currents form. The power-law rheology model, which has been shown to model fluid-mud rheology well, was incorporated in the theoretical analysis. The proposed Fanning friction factor-Reynolds number relationship includes a proportionality constant (henceforth, the shape factor) that considers the shape of the current. For non-Newtonian fluid-mud gravity currents, a relationship for the shape factor was developed through laboratory experiments. Different potential applications of the developed friction factor-Reynolds number relationship are discussed. In this regard, a new viscous propagation model was developed and evaluated through comparisons with laboratory experimental data for fluid-mud gravity currents. The approach presented in this manuscript can be extended for currents of different fluids propagating over smooth and rough bottoms.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0022-1686	1814-2079		WOS:000341847100011

UV-induced self-repairing polydimethylsiloxane-polyurethane (PDMS-PUR) and polyethylene glycol-polyurethane (PEG-PUR) Cu-catalyzed networks								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A				2	37			15527	15534		10.1039/c4ta02417f			2014	2014	UV-induced self-repairing polydimethylsiloxane-polyurethane (PDMS-PUR) crosslinked networks capable of repairing mechanical damage upon UV exposure were developed. Induced by the presence of the copper chloride (CuCl2) catalyst, the network remodeling and bond reformation are achieved by the formation of Cu-O coordination complexes, covalent Si-O-Si hydrolysis with subsequent bond reformation. Upon UV exposure, Cu-O complexes undergo tetrahedral-to-distorted tetrahedral rearrangements which parallel the Si-O bond reformation. When PDMS was substituted with OH-terminated polyethylene glycol (PEG) to form PEG-PUR crosslinked networks, square planar-to-tetrahedral rearrangements occur during the damage-repair cycle. Alkyl backbone distortions and segmental motions induced by the local Cu-O symmetry changes result in volume changes of the metal-ligand complex center. These studies show that a combination of supramolecular and covalent bonds facilitates self-repairing.									9	1	0	0	0	10			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000341457000037

Plant signaling & behavior				9	4			e28700	e28700		10.4161/psb.28700			2014	2014	The microRNA319 family (miR319) is one of the most conserved and ancient microRNA (miRNA) families in plants. Transgenic creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera) overexpressing a rice miR319, Osa-miR319a, exhibited enhanced salt and drought tolerance. A comprehensive hypothetical model about the role of miR319 in creeping bentgrass response to salinity and drought stress was proposed. Salinity and drought stress induces elevated expression of miR319, resulting in downregulation of at least 4 putative target genes of miR319 (AsPCF5, AsPCF6, AsPCF8, and AsTCP14) as well as a homolog of the rice NAC domain gene AsNAC60, and therefore positively contributing to plant abiotic stress response. Hormones might also regulate miR319 and its targets, and the expression level of the miR319 targets might be a balance of miR319-mediated target cleavage and hormone regulation of the targets. Furthermore, HKT gene families involved in salt exclusion mechanisms as well as mechanisms controlling the timing of gene expression network are also hypothesized to play an important role in this pathway.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1559-2324		MEDLINE:25764437	25764437

We developed a lab-on-chip wherein single-neuron axonal pathfinding under geometric guidance was created using soft lithography and laser cell-micropatterning techniques. After coating the surface with L1, an axon-specific member of the Ig family of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), and optimizing microunit geometric parameters, we introduced low-dose methylmercury, a well-known, environmentally significant neurotoxicant, in the shared medium. Its developmental neurotoxicity was evaluated using a novel axonal pathfinding assay including axonal turning and branching rates at turning points in this model. Compared to the conventional neurite-outgrowth assay, this model's detection threshold for low-dose methylmercury was 10-fold more sensitive at comparable exposure durations. These preliminary results support study of developmental effects of known and potential neurotoxicants on axon pathfinding. This novel assay model would be useful to study neuronal disease mechanisms at the single-cell level. To our knowledge, the potential of methylmercury chloride to cause acute in vitro developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) at such a low dosage has not been reported.

The influence of managerial myopia on firm strategy								MANAGEMENT DECISION				52	3			602	623		10.1108/MD-01-2013-0037			2014	2014	Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of temporal myopia (focussing on the short-term) and spatial myopia (focussing on the current market) on firm strategy. Specifically the paper investigates the effects of temporal and spatial myopia on the persistence and conformity of firm strategy. Additionally, the paper tests how environmental munificence moderates these effects. A secondary purpose of this paper is to develop a replicable method of measurement of temporal and spatial myopia.Design/methodology/approach - The authors conducted a manual content analysis of letters to shareholders for 100 firms over three years to measure spatial and temporal myopia. After collecting strategy variables and control variables from Compustat, the authors utilize a random-effects panel methodology. Findings - The results indicate that strategy is influenced by both temporal and spatial myopia. Specifically, temporal myopia creates a focus on the firm's current strategy, leading to a persistent strategy over time and spatial myopia focusses firm decision makers on better known technologies and competitors, leading to conformity to industry strategic profiles. Additionally, the paper tests how environmental munificence influences these relationships. In total, the paper finds that the differing types of managerial myopia have distinct influences on firm outcomes.Originality/value - This paper makes two important contributions to the literature on managerial myopia. First, the paper investigates the differential effects of both spatial and temporal myopia on firm strategy, topics that have been relatively overlooked in empirical investigations of decision making. Second, the paper develops replicable measures for both temporal and spatial myopia, which have been previously suggested to limit the ability to empirically test the implications of managerial myopia (Laverty, 1996).									2	0	0	0	0	2			0025-1747	1758-6070		WOS:000340764600010		
J	Angele-Martinez, Carlos; Goodman, Craig; Brumaghim, Julia								Metal-mediated DNA damage and cell death: mechanisms, detection methods, and cellular consequences								METALLOMICS				6	8			1358	1381		10.1039/c4mt00057a			2014	2014	The redox activity of metal ions can lead to the formation of highly reactive species that damage DNA, producing different oxidation products and types of damage depending upon the redox potentials of the DNA bases, formation of intermediate adducts, and identity of the reactive species. Other factors are also important in determining the degree of metal-mediated DNA damage, such as localization and redox chemistry of the metal ions or complexes and lifetimes of the reactive oxygen species generated. This review examines the types of DNA damage mediated by first-row transition metals under oxidative stress conditions, with emphasis on work published in the past ten years. Similarities and differences between DNA damage mechanisms of the first-row transition metals in vitro and in E. coli and human cells are compared and their relationship to disease development are discussed. Methods to detect this metal-mediated DNA damage, including backbone breakage, base oxidation, inter- and intra-strand crosslinking, and DNA-protein crosslinking are also briefly reviewed, as well as detection methods for reactive oxygen species generated by these metal ions. Understanding the conditions that cause metal-mediated DNA damage and metal generation of reactive oxygen species in vitro and in cells is required to develop effective drugs to prevent and treat chronic disease.									12	1	0	8	0	13			1756-5901	1756-591X		WOS:000341019600005	24788233

Gopal, TV; Agrawal, M; Li, A; Cooper, SB		Self-stabilizing Minimal Global Offensive Alliance Algorithm with Safe Convergence in an Arbitrary Graph								THEORY AND APPLICATIONS OF MODELS OF COMPUTATION (TAMC 2014)		Lecture Notes in Computer Science		8402				366	377					2014	2014	In a graph or a network G = (V, E), a set S subset of V is a global offensive alliance if each node i is an element of{V - S} has |N[i] boolean AND S| >= | N[i] - S|. A global offensive alliance S is called minimal when there does not exist a node i is an element of S such that the set S - {i} is a global offensive alliance. In this paper, we propose a new self-stabilizing algorithm for minimal global offensive alliance. It has safe convergence property under synchronous daemon in the sense that starting from an arbitrary state, it quickly converges to a global offensive alliance (a safe state) in two rounds, and then stabilizes in a minimal global offensive alliance (the legitimate state) in O(n) rounds without breaking safety during the convergence interval, where n is the number of nodes. Space requirement at each node is O(log n) bits.					11th Annual Conference on Theory and Applications of Models of Computation (TAMC)11th Annual Conference on Theory and Applications of Models of Computation (TAMC)	APR 11-13, 2014APR 11-13, 2014	Anna Univ, Coll Engn Guindy, Vivekananda AuditoriumAnna Univ, Coll Engn Guindy, Vivekananda Auditorium	Chennai, INDIAChennai, INDIA	1	0	0	0	0	1			0302-9743		978-3-319-06089-7; 978-3-319-06088-0	WOS:000340590700026

Public agency activities related to contracts must be efficient, fair, and consistent to maintain compliance with state and federal policies. The South Carolina DOT identified a need to develop a comprehensive training program for professional service contract managers to support consistent and efficient execution of department contracts. The objectives of this study were to develop a training program for South Carolina DOT professional services contract managers and to evaluate the training program for statewide adoption. The study resulted in the development of a comprehensive training program to ensure that current and future South Carolina DOT contract managers across the department procure and administer professional services contracts with consistency and effectiveness. Lessons learned and issues identified during development of the training program by an external research team, with oversight by a South Carolina DOT steering committee, are discussed. The training was implemented with South Carolina DOT contract managers in a pilot training session that included contract managers and their supervisors. This paper's presentation of the training program's development process and unique experiences can be applied to other state DOTs to support the improvement of their procurement and administrative processes.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0361-1981	2169-4052		WOS:000341169200004

Digital mammography has become commonplace in recent years. High quality mammogram images are large in size, providing high-resolution data. Estimates of the false negative rate for cancers in mammography are approximately 10%-30%. This may be due to observation error, but more frequently it is because the cancer is hidden by other dense tissue in the breast and even after retrospective review of the mammogram, cannot be seen. In this study, we report on the results of novel image processing algorithms that will enhance the images providing decision support to reading physicians. Techniques such as Butterworth high pass filtering and Gabor filters will be applied to enhance images; followed by segmentation of the region of interest (ROI). Subsequently, the textural features will be extracted from the ROI, which will be used to classify the ROIs as either masses or non-masses. Among the statistical methods most used for the characterization of textures, the co-occurrence matrix makes it possible to determine the frequency of appearance of two pixels separated by a distance, at an angle from the horizontal. This matrix contains a very large amount of information that is complex. Therefore, it is not used directly but through measurements known as indices of texture such as average, variance, energy, contrast, correlation, normalized correlation and entropy.

Attitudes toward Water Conservation: The Influence of Site-Specific Factors and Beliefs in Climate Change								SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES				27	9			964	982		10.1080/08941920.2014.929768			2014	2014	Areas affected by drought are increasing, and many lakes that provide potable water and recreation opportunities are located in drought-vulnerable areas. Understanding a population's attitudes toward conservation actions can improve communication initiatives, policy development, and education, which are all necessary for effective water resource management. However, little is known about stakeholders' interactions with drought-influenced resources and the potential factors that form their water conservation attitudes. Using a mixed methods approach, we evaluated lake recreationists' (n=229) attitudes toward water conservation at a drought-impacted lake. We identified the relationships between two site-specific factors (place attachment and awareness of drought impacts), beliefs in climate change, concern for drought impacts, and water conservation attitudes. Results indicated concern for local drought impacts fully mediated the relationships between site-specific factors, beliefs in climate change, and attitudes toward water conservation behaviors. Implications for research, outreach, and water resource management are discussed.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0894-1920	1521-0723		WOS:000340453700005

Host Preference of the Parasitoid Trichopoda pennipes (Diptera: Tachinidae) with Euschistus servus and Nezara viridula (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae)(1)								JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGICAL SCIENCE				49	1			56	62					JAN 2014	2014	Laboratory studies were conducted to determine the host preference of the tachinid parasitoid fly Trichopoda pennipes (F) for the brown stink bug, Euschistus servus (Say), and the southern green stink bug, Nezara viridula (L.). In choice and no-choice tests, 8-fold fewer eggs were laid on E. servus compared with N. viridula. Twenty-four T pennipes emerged from 100 N. viridula, whereas-only 2 larvae emerged from 100 laboratory-parasitized E. servus. Postmortem dissections of egg-bearing stink bugs without larval emergence revealed 20 T pennipes larvae inside N. viridula but only 1 inside E. servus. These results confirm that T pennipes prefers N. viridula as a host and is likely only an infrequent parasitoid of E. servus.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0749-8004			WOS:000330745900006

Previous research has established a positive correlation between happiness and mindfulness, but, to date, no research has examined how each of these variables is related to complaining in the form of pet peeves. Four hundred ten male and female college students listed the pet peeves they had with a current or former relationship partner. They also completed measures of happiness, positive and negative affect, depression, mindfulness, relationship satisfaction, and satisfaction with life. Pet peeves were negatively correlated with relationship satisfaction, well-being, and mindfulness. Consistent with hypotheses, support was found for the mediating role of mindfulness in the relationship between happiness and pet peeves.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-4545	1940-1183		WOS:000337948300002	25154112

Detection of internal cracks in rubber composite structures using an impact acoustic modality								NONDESTRUCTIVE TESTING AND EVALUATION				29	1			29	51		10.1080/10589759.2013.823611			2014	2014	The objective of this study is to investigate the use of impact acoustic signals to non-intrusively inspect rubber composite structures for the presence of internal cracks, such as those found in an automobile tyre. Theoretical contact dynamic models for both integral and defective rubber structures are developed based on Hertz's impact model, further modified for rubber composite materials. The model generates the prediction of major impact dynamic quantities, namely the maximum impact force, impact duration and contact deformation; such parameters are also theoretically proven to be correlated with the presence of internal cracks. The tyre structures are simplified into cubic rubber blocks, to mitigate complexity for analytical modelling. Both impact force and impact sound signals are measured experimentally, and extraction of useful features from both signals for defect identification is achieved. The impact force produces two direct measurements of theoretical impact dynamic quantities. A good correlation between these experimental discriminators and the theoretical dynamic quantities provide validation for the contact dynamics models. Defect discriminators extracted from the impact sound are dependent on both time-and frequency-domain analyses. All the discriminators are closely connected with the theoretical dynamic quantities and experimentally verified as good indicators of internal cracks in rubber composite structures.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1058-9759	1477-2671		WOS:000337190700003

However, academic research on this phenomenon is sparse. Further, studies on outsourcing have primarily used a transaction cost economics (TCE) lens, largely neglecting other key theoretical explanations of the outsourcing decision and performance. While TCE provides a useful framework, it underemphasises hybrid governance structures that reflect relationships that fall between markets and hierarchies. We examine the decision to adopt relationally governed BPO arrangements and the impact on firm value. We recognise 'discriminatory alignment' aspects of governance and argue that the nature of the process itself will influence the value that can be garnered through relational governance. Using secondary data on 298 BPO announcements, we test the proposed model and confirm that a higher level of relational governance adoption strongly enhances firm valuation. This positive valuation impact of relational governance adoption reaches an even higher level in situations of primary processes and processes that have had a presence in the outsourcing organisation. The results emphasise the importance of considering all processes for outsourcing, the critical consideration of relational governance and the importance of planning governance structures that are aligned with the nature and experience with the process being outsourced.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0020-7543	1366-588X		WOS:000340126000019		
J	Ross, Brandon E.; Naji, Behnam								Model for Nominal Bond-Shear Capacity of Pretensioned Concrete Girders								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD					2406			79	86		10.3141/2406-09			2014	2014	The 2010AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications includes requirements for proportioning flexural reinforcement at the end of pretensioned girders to carry longitudinal tie forces acting above the support. To prevent bond failure of the longitudinal tie, AASHTO requires that "any lack of full development [of the tie] shall be accounted for." This paper proposes a model for calculating nominal bond-shear capacity, which is defined as the attendant shear force at bond capacity of the longitudinal tie. The model gives explicit consideration for tie development length. Variables in the model include bearing and girder geometry, longitudinal and transverse reinforcement details, and inclination angle of cracking. Derivation of the model is presented, and the model is compared with a database of experimental results compiled from the published literature. The proposed model can be used for designing girders that are resistant to bond-shear failure, particularly when partial strand debonding is employed. In some circumstances the model may justify exceedance of the AASHTO limits for partial strand debonding.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0361-1981	2169-4052		WOS:000340231100009

It examines the relationships between these constructs and identifies that the model of the relationship is applicable in regions with different cultural foundations.Design/methodology/approach - A sample of 1,174 consumers from four Asian economies with a strong Chinese background - mainland China (364), Hong Kong (260), Taiwan (289), and Singapore (261) - were recruited through an international online panel provider. Structural equation modelling was used to test the hypothesised relationships in the proposed model.Findings - The relationships within the model were all confirmed, with the exception of the link between the DSP and environmental concern, which was positive, which suggests that within these Asian economics there may be a realisation that consumption and the environment are intertwined. DSP was found to influence the dimensions of materialism and materialism negatively impacted on environmental concern. Environmental concern in turn increased direct and indirect environmental behaviours.Originality/value - This research is the first to look at the application of the Dominant Social Paradigm in Asian economies and shows that it applies in that context, although the relationships do differ to those identified in past research in Western economies. The model linking the DSP, materialism, environmental concern and environmental behaviours showed that most relationships are generalisable. However, the positive relationship between the DSP and environmental concern suggests that consumers in Asian economies appear to make a connection between consumption and its environmental impacts.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0309-0566	1758-7123		WOS:000339628600006

Concurrent Computational and Dimensional Analyses of Design of Vehicle Floor-Plates for Landmine-Blast Survivability								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				23	1			1	12		10.1007/s11665-013-0637-5			JAN 2014	2014	Development of military vehicles capable of surviving landmine blast is seldom done using full-scale prototype testing because of the associated prohibitively-high cost, the destructive nature of testing, and the requirements for major large-scale experimental-test facilities and a large crew of engineers committed to the task. Instead, tests of small-scale models are generally employed and the model-based results are scaled up to the full-size vehicle. In these scale-up efforts, various dimensional analyses are used whose establishment and validation requires major experimental testing efforts and different-scale models. In the present work, an approach is proposed within which concurrent and interactive applications of the computational analyses (of landmine detonation and the interaction of detonation products and soil ejecta with the vehicle hull-floor) and the corresponding dimensional analysis are utilized. It is argued that this approach can guide the design of military-vehicle hull-floors which provide the required level of protection to the vehicle occupants under landmine blast attack without introducing unnecessarily high weight to the vehicle. To validate this approach, a combined Eulerian/Lagrangian formulation for landmine detonation and the interaction of detonation products and soil ejecta with the vehicle hull-floor (developed in our previous work) has been utilized along with the experimental results pertaining to small-scale model and full-scale vehicle testing.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1059-9495	1544-1024		WOS:000330209800001

One design of solar power plants consists of an array of heliostats which redirects sunlight to a fixed receiver tower and the generated heat, is converted into electricity. Currently, the angles of elevation of heliostats are controlled by motors and drives that are costly and require diverting, power that can otherwise be used for producing electricity. We consider replacing the motor and drive system of the heliostat with a photosensitive polymer design that can tilt the mirror using the ability of the polymer to deform when subjected to light. The light causes the underlying molecular structure to change and subsequently, the polymer deforms. The deformation of the polymer is quantified in terms of photostrictive constitutive relations. A mathematical model is derived governing the behaviour of the angle of elevation as the photostrain varies. Photostrain depends on the composition of the polymer, intensity and temperature of light and angle of light polarization. Preliminary findings show a photomechanical rod structural design can provide 60 degrees elevation for temperatures of about 40 degrees C. A photomechanical beam structural design can generate more tilt at lower temperatures. The mathematical analysis illustrates that photostrains on the order of 1% to 10% are desired for both rod and beam designs to produce sufficient tilt under most heliostat field conditions.

Signal loss in the TSVs escalated with peak cycling temperature for some samples due to the resulting increased void content. This void area increase was attributed to the formation of new voids and not growth of pre-existing voids. The Cu microstructure in the TSVs appeared to be unaffected by the cycling.

JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY				99	1			1	20		10.1037/a0034377			JAN 2014	2014	The concept of differential validity suggests that cognitive ability tests are associated with varying levels of validity across ethnic groups, such that validity is lower in certain ethnic subgroups than in others. A recent meta-analysis has revived the viability of this concept. Unfortunately, data were not available in this meta-analysis to correct for range restriction within ethnic groups. We reviewed the differential validity literature and conducted 4 studies. In Study 1, we empirically demonstrated that using a cognitive ability test with a common cutoff decreases variance in test scores of Black subgroup samples more than in White samples. In Study 2, we developed a simulation that examined the effects of range restriction on estimates of differential validity. Results demonstrated that different levels of range restriction for subgroups can explain the apparent observed differential validity results in employment and educational settings (but not military settings) when no differential validity exists in the population. In Study 3, we conducted a simulation in which we examined how one corrects for range restriction affects the accuracy of these corrections. Results suggest that the correction approach using a common range restriction ratio for various subgroups may create or perpetuate the illusion of differential validity and that corrections are most accurate when done within each subgroup. Finally, in Study 4, we conducted a simulation in which we assumed differential validity in the population. We found that range restriction artificially increased the size of observed differential validity estimates when the validity of cognitive ability tests was assumed to be higher among Whites. Overall, we suggest that the concept of differential validity may be largely artifactual and current data are not definitive enough to suggest such effects exist.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0021-9010	1939-1854		WOS:000339879700001	24079670

The rotator cuff is composed of muscles and tendons that work in tandem to support the shoulder. Heavy use of these muscles can lead to rotator cuff tear, with the most common causes is age-related degeneration or sport injuries, both being a function of overuse. Tears ranges in severity from partial thickness tear to total rupture. Diagnostic techniques are based on physical assessment, detailed patient history, and medical imaging; primarily X-ray, MRI and ultrasonography are the chosen modalities for assessment. The final treatment technique and imaging modality; however, is chosen by the clinician is at their discretion. Ultrasound has been shown to have good accuracy for identification and measurement of full-thickness and partial-thickness rotator cuff tears. In this study, we report on the progress and improvement of our method of transduction and analysis of in situ measurement of rotator cuff biomechanics. We have improved the ability of the clinician to apply a uniform force to the underlying musculotendentious tissues while simultaneously obtaining the ultrasound image. This measurement protocol combined with region of interest (ROI) based image processing will help in developing a predictive diagnostic model for treatment of rotator cuff disease and help the clinicians choose the best treatment technique.

Most of these defects are present in starting wafers and some are generated during device processing. There is little conclusive evidence so far on the exact role that the crystal defects paly on device performance, manufacturing yield, and more importantly, long-term field-reliability especially when devices are operating under extreme stressful environments. This paper provides a review of the current state-of-the-art of SiC and GaN power semiconductor material technology, and the potential impact crystal defects may have on high-density power switching electronics. A review of silicon technology development and manufacturing evolution is made to draw a parallel between silicon and wide bandgap (WBG) semiconductor power electronics.

The use of 3D carbon electrodes allows for higher throughput and efficiency when compared to more traditional DEP techniques, such as metal-electrode and insulator-based DEP. The applications presented here all feature a protocol that allows for enrichment and purification of a targeted particle population from a sample; and effectively enables sample preparation for downstream analysis. The final goal is the integration of independent carbon-electrode arrays, optimized in their geometry and polarizing signals, to achieve an automated sample preparation device comprising functions such as concentration, purification and lysis.

Accordingly, it is important to delineate the impact of these carbon-based nanoparticles on protein structure, dynamics, and subsequently function. Here, we focused on the effect of hydroxylation - a common strategy for solubilizing and functionalizing fullerene - on protein-nanoparticle interactions using a model protein, ubiquitin. We applied a set of complementary computational modeling methods, including docking and molecular dynamics simulations with both explicit and implicit solvent, to illustrate the impact of hydroxylated fullerenes on the structure and dynamics of ubiquitin. We found that all derivatives bound to the model protein. Specifically, the more hydrophilic nanoparticles with a higher number of hydroxyl groups bound to the surface of the protein via hydrogen bonds, which stabilized the protein without inducing large conformational changes in the protein structure. In contrast, fullerene derivatives with a smaller number of hydroxyl groups buried their hydrophobic surface inside the protein, thereby causing protein denaturation. Overall, our results revealed a distinct role of surface chemistry on nanoparticle-protein binding and binding-induced protein misfolding.									16	1	0	2	0	16			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000338638900082	24934397

Based on a literature review on the topic of LoA decision-making, a need for involving the assembly sequence in the decision was identified. The representation methods used in both assembly modelling and planning and other more generic approaches in the literature were studied and evaluated. The evaluation has been based on a requirements definition describing how the representation should support the decision about automation. Identified gaps in requirement satisfaction from the existing approaches led to the definition of the assembly sequence modelling language (ASML), a new modelling language that combines principles from and improvements on the studied methods and a standard vocabulary of assembly actions. The modelling language was demonstrated in an assembly example and was successfully evaluated with regard to the defined requirements. Thus, this new modelling approach, ASML, is offered as an innovative and intuitive support in the decision-making process for selecting automation levels in Assembly.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0020-7543	1366-588X		WOS:000338226200019

B) on a silver thin film. Silver films of 50 nm thickness on glass slides were fabricated by thermal evaporation. Nano a-alumina was synthesized through the combustion route and characterized by XRD. The a-alumina was dispersed in the PVA-Rh. B matrix by tip sonication. The resultant solution was spin coated on the Ag thin film at 3000 rpm to generate an overcoat of similar to 30 nm. We have designed and constructed an opto-mechanical setup for performing the SPCE studies. Excitation with a 532 nm continuous laser, led to the coupling of the energy of Rh. B emission to the surface plasmon modes of silver. The emission @ 580 nm was recorded using an Ocean Optics c fiber optic spectrometer. Calculation of the ratio of signal intensity between the directional SPCE and isotropic fluorescence gives us the factor of signal enhancements which SPCE offers. We report an `8 fold' signal enhancement attributed to SPCE arising from the metal oxide doped thin film hybrid. We observed only a `5 fold' signal enhancement in the case of a thin film hybrid without a-alumina. The emission was also 92% P-polarized which is in coherence with the theory of SPCE. The greater degree of signal enhancement observed in the a-alumina doped thin film substrate can be attributed to the surface roughness which alumina offers to silver, which along with the porous nature of alumina enables a greater degree of adsorption of Rh. B which results in a higher emission intensity. Computational modeling was also performed, based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) calculations to provide theoretical background to observed experimental data. The a-alumina thin film hybrid can be extended as an economical sensing platform towards the high sensitive detection of analytes.					2nd International Conference on Optoelectronic Materials and Thin Films for Advanced Technology (OMTAT)2nd International Conference on Optoelectronic Materials and Thin Films for Advanced Technology (OMTAT)	JAN 03-05, 2013JAN 03-05, 2013	Int Soc Opt & Photon; Electrochem Soc; Kerala State Council Sci & Technol; Def Res & Dev Org; Board Res Fus Sci & Technol; Dept Sci & Technol; Council Sci & Ind Res; All India Council Tech Educ & Dept Biotechnol; Dept Biotechnol; Univ Grants Commiss; Cochin Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Phys; SPIE; Cochin Univ, ECS Student ChaptersInt Soc Opt & Photon; Electrochem Soc; Kerala State Council Sci & Technol; Def Res & Dev Org; Board Res Fus Sci & Technol; Dept Sci & Technol; Council Sci & Ind Res; All India Council Tech Educ & Dept Biotechnol; Dept Biotechnol; Univ Grants Commiss; Cochin Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Phys; SPIE; Cochin Univ, ECS Student Chapters	Kochi, INDIAKochi, INDIA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0094-243X		978-0-7354-1206-4	WOS:000338055000003

A synthesis of manipulation experiments								BIOGEOSCIENCES				11	11			2991	3013		10.5194/bg-11-2991-2014			2014	2014	As a key component of the carbon cycle, soil CO2 efflux (SCE) is being increasingly studied to improve our mechanistic understanding of this important carbon flux. Predicting ecosystem responses to climate change often depends on extrapolation of current relationships between ecosystem processes and their climatic drivers to conditions not yet experienced by the ecosystem. This raises the question of to what extent these relationships remain unaltered beyond the current climatic window for which observations are available to constrain the relationships. Here, we evaluate whether current responses of SCE to fluctuations in soil temperature and soil water content can be used to predict SCE under altered rainfall patterns. Of the 58 experiments for which we gathered SCE data, 20 were discarded because either too few data were available or inconsistencies precluded their incorporation in the analyses. The 38 remaining experiments were used to test the hypothesis that a model parameterized with data from the control plots (using soil temperature and water content as predictor variables) could adequately predict SCE measured in the manipulated treatment. Only for 7 of these 38 experiments was this hypothesis rejected. Importantly, these were the experiments with the most reliable data sets, i.e., those providing high-frequency measurements of SCE. Regression tree analysis demonstrated that our hypothesis could be rejected only for experiments with measurement intervals of less than 11 days, and was not rejected for any of the 24 experiments with larger measurement intervals. This highlights the importance of high-frequency measurements when studying effects of altered precipitation on SCE, probably because infrequent measurement schemes have insufficient capacity to detect shifts in the climate dependencies of SCE. Hence, the most justified answer to the question of whether current moisture responses of SCE can be extrapolated to predict SCE under altered precipitation regimes is 'no' - as based on the most reliable data sets available. We strongly recommend that future experiments focus more strongly on establishing response functions across a broader range of precipitation regimes and soil moisture conditions. Such experiments should make accurate measurements of water availability, should conduct high-frequency SCE measurements, and should consider both instantaneous responses and the potential legacy effects of climate extremes. This is important, because with the novel approach presented here, we demonstrated that, at least for some ecosystems, current moisture responses could not be extrapolated to predict SCE under altered rainfall conditions.									15	1	0	13	0	16			1726-4170	1726-4189		WOS:000337950900007

The maximum wall deflection induced by the excavation was chosen as the response of concern in the design and was computed using a finite element analysis model based upon the beam-on-elastic-foundation theory. The variation of the maximum wall deflection of a given design of a braced excavation due to uncertainty in the soil parameters and the surcharges was used as a measure of the design robustness. The robust design of the braced excavation system (including soil, wall, and support) was then formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, in which the variation of the maximum wall deflection (a signal of the design robustness) and the cost were optimized with the strict safety constraints. Using a multi-objective genetic algorithm, the optimal designs were then determined, the results of which were presented as a Pareto Front that exhibited a trade-off relationship useful for design decision-making. Furthermore, the "knee point" concept, based upon the "gain-sacrifice" trade-off is used in the selection of the most-preferred design from the Pareto Front. Finally, a design example of a braced excavation system was used to illustrate the significance of this proposed methodology. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

However, even in the absence of thermal roll-over or catastrophic optical damage (COD), the maximum achievable power is limited by optical non-linear effects. Due to its non-linear nature, two-photon absorption (TPA) becomes one of the dominant factors that limit efficient extraction of laser power from LDs. In this paper, theoretical and experimental analysis of TPA in high-power broad area laser diodes (BALD) is presented. A phenomenological optical extraction model that incorporates TPA explains the reduction in optical extraction efficiency at high intensities in BALD bars with 100 mu m-wide emitters. The model includes two contributions associated with TPA: the straightforward absorption of laser photons and the subsequent single photon absorption by the holes and electrons generated by the TPA process. TPA is a fundamental limitation since it is inherent to the LD semiconductor material. Therefore scaling the LDs to high power requires designs that reduce the optical intensity by increasing the mode size.

The combined laser system is fully integrated without any external components or feedback control. In our design, adjacent angled-grating broad-area lasers have opposite tilting angles and overlap around the facet. The coherent beam combining is obtained through the Bragg diffraction in the overlapped areas. The near diffraction-limited interference pattern in the far field shows that good spatial coherence is obtained among all six individual lasers. The optical spectra of each output aperture are measured and exhibit the same lasing wavelengths.

J	Curtis, K. Amber								In Times of Crisis: The Conditions of Pocketbook Effects								INTERNATIONAL INTERACTIONS				40	3	SI		402	430		10.1080/03050629.2014.902816			2014	2014	When and how will personal financial (aka "pocketbook") concerns drive citizens' political decisions? Scholars remain puzzled by the mismatch between the expectation that pocketbook voting should occur and the reality that, according to most findings, it usually does not. Using original survey data collected immediately after Iceland's second "Icesave" referendum (2011), I first report the results of an embedded experiment that successfully evokes greater pocketbook concern. Next, I analyze the determinants of retrospective pocketbook evaluations, showing that priming effects are conditioned by political sophistication such that high sophisticates are among the most likely to report negative economic assessments. I then turn to the consequences of these egocentric views for government approval. Mediation analysis confirms a significant indirect effect, suggesting that subjective pocketbook evaluations exert a strong influence on political attitudes that has been hidden in prior work. Results illuminate the contextual, cognitive, and causal circumstances under which pocketbook effects transpire and suggest new ways in which self-interest might matter for attitudes toward international political economy issues.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0305-0629	1547-7444		WOS:000337359000006

If the torus T admits a pseudo-Anosov map we give a homological criterion for the appearance of dense leaves and leaves with bounded deviation on the universal covering of T, called Panov plane. Our result generalizes Dmitri Panov's explicit construction of dense leaves for certain arithmetic half-translation tori [33]. Certain Panov planes are related to the polygonal table of the periodic wind-tree model. In fact, we show that the dynamics on periodic wind-tree billiards can be converted to the dynamics on a pair of singular planes.Possible strategies to generalize our main dynamical result to larger sets of directions are discussed. Particularly we include recent results of Frgczek and Ulcigrai IS] and Delecroix [6] for the wind-tree model. Implicitly Panov planes appear in Fr4czek and Schmoll [15], where the authors consider Eaton Lens distributions.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1935-9179			WOS:000337109300009

Lightweight graphene-based materials have been pursued for their exclusive microstructures and unique shielding mechanism. However, the large thickness of the current low-density graphene-based composites still limits their application potential in ultrathin devices. In this work, a novel approach has been taken to use conductive graphene paper (GP) in the fabrication of ultrathin EMI shielding materials. The as-prepared flexible GPs exhibit highly effective shielding capabilities, reaching similar to 19.0 dB at similar to 0.1 mm in thickness and similar to 46.3 dB at similar to 0.3 mm in thickness, thus the thinnest GPs having the best shielding performance among graphene-based shielding materials. Double-layered shielding attenuators have been designed and fabricated for a high shielding performance of up to similar to 47.7 dB at a GP thickness of similar to 0.1 mm. Mechanistically, the high performance should be due to Fabry-Perot resonance, which is unusual in carbon-based shielding materials. The preparation of conductive GPs of superior shielding performance is relatively simple, amenable to largescale production of ultrathin materials for EMI shielding and electromagnetic attenuators, with broad applications in lightweight portable electronic devices.									30	1	0	2	0	31			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000337129700020

A launched beam of light into the disordered optical fiber expands till it reaches its localization radius beyond which it propagates without further expansion. In contrast to a conventional single-core optical fiber in which a propagating beam of light can only couple to and propagate in the core, the beam of light can be coupled to any point at the tip of the disordered fiber. This property originated from the localized highly multimodal property of disordered optical fibers that can be used for high quality optical image transport. We experimentally compare the quality of the transported images in the disordered polymer optical fibers with those transported through the multicore imaging fibers, as well as conventional single core fibers. The impacts of source wavelength and refractive index difference between the disordered sites on the quality of the transported images in the disordered optical fibers is studied numerically. The role of randomness in improving the quality of transported images is investigated by comparing the full vectorial modes of a disordered fiber with those in a periodic multicore fiber.

The objective of this study was to develop and test an artifact from an introductory soil science course to be included in the individual student ePortfolio utilizing Microsoft PowerPoint and Google Sites through Google Apps for Education. A State/Representative Soil Project developed for the FNR 204: Soil Information Systems course at Clemson University, taught in the fall of 2008, was used to create a PowerPoint presentation to be incorporated as an artifact for the ePortfolio. Fifty-seven students from various fields (forestry, wildlife biology, and environmental science) were surveyed following the exercise regarding the usefulness of including the PowerPoint presentation of the State/Representative Soil Project as an artifact in their ePortfolios. Students created an artifact for their ePortfolio, learned more about soil information systems, and completed a requirement for the course. Feedback was received on how to improve the artifact and its usability in their ePortfolio. Overall, student responses were positive, indicating that incorporation of the State/Representative Soil Project artifact can enhance their ePortfolios.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2168-8273	2168-8281		BCI:BCI201400467638

Greenhouse Evaluation of Section Arachis Wild Species for Sclerotinia Blight and Cylindrocladium Black Rot Resistance								Peanut Science				41	1			17	24					JAN 2014	2014	Wild Arachis species from section Arachis have been promoted as sources of resistance to common peanut diseases and insect pests. The objective of our study was to identify wild Arachis species with resistance to Sclerotinia blight and Cylindrocladium black rot (CBR). One hundred and ten accessions/entries from 23 Arachis species including A. hypogaea were evaluated in the greenhouses at North Carolina State University between January and March of 2010 in a 11x10 rectangular lattice experimental design with 4 replications for Sclerotinia blight and 6 replications for CBR. For the Sclerotinia blight test, seeds were planted in 10 cm clay pots and 8-wk-old plants were inoculated in a mist chamber with BEEM capsules containing the fungus inserted on the petioles of the 4th leaf from the apex on the primary branch. Lesion lengths were measured 4, 5, 6, and 7 d after inoculation, and areas under the disease progress curves (AUDPC) were calculated. For the CBR test, seeds were planted in soil mixed with microsclerotia (25/g) in cone-tainers partly immersed in water. Root damage was recorded after 60 d on a 0-5 proportional scale (0=no decay to 5=completely decayed). Data analysis indicated significant (p<0.05) variation among and within Arachis species for both diseases. Arachis glandulifera exhibited the highest level of Sclerotinia blight resistance followed by A. correntina, A. herzogii, and A. helodes, although the last three species were not significantly different from A. hypogaea. Overall, low genetic variability for Sclerotinia blight resistance was observed among the wild species accessions. For CBR, A. valida, A. cruziana, A. microsperma, A. williamsii, A. kempff-mercadoi, A. kuhlmannii, A. helodes, A. cardenasii and A. correntina formed the most resistant group with A. hypogaea in the most susceptible group. Overall, significant genetic variability for CBR resistance was found among the different wild species accessions. However, not all accessions within a species were resistant to either disease, and most accessions that were resistant to one disease were susceptible to the other.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0095-3679			BCI:BCI201400498593

The purpose of this study was to compare the environmental impacts of three likely algaculture integration strategies to a conventional nutrient removal strategy. Process modeling was used to determine life cycle inventory data and a comparative life cycle assessment was used to determine environmental impacts. Treatment scenarios included a base case treatment plant without nutrient removal, a plant with conventional nutrient removal, and three other cases with algal unit processes placed at the head of the plant, in a side stream, and at the end of the plant, respectively. Impact categories included eutrophication, global warming, ecotoxicity, and primary energy demand. Integrating algaculture prior to activated sludge proved to be most beneficial of the scenarios considered for all impact categories; however, this scenario would also require primary sedimentation and impacts of that unit process should be considered for implementation of such a system.									4	0	0	2	0	4			2050-7887	2050-7895		WOS:000336841600019	24834441

The results reported herein confirm important new concepts due to the multi-role chemistry of the Pr added Co4Sb12 skutterudites (i.e. PryCo4Sb12), including: (1) exotic behavior in the Seebeck coefficient, alpha, as Pr is introduced to the matrix (2) an increase in ZT(max) (approximate to 1.0 at T approximate to 800 K) and the temperature range for ZT(max) as Pr is increased and (3) confirmation of secondary phase(s) aiding in the improvement of TE properties.									5	0	0	0	0	5			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000336848600048

However, in SIM, the frequency of the spatial modulation applied to specimens should be adjustable according to the optical properties of the specimens to reach the optimal contrasts. Hence, a common theme in SIM is how the flexibility and quality of modulations at different frequencies can be improved. Digital scanned laser light-sheet microscopy with structured illumination (DSLM-SI) has been the most flexible means for generating modulation and optical sectioning. The complexity of synchronization between the temporal modulation and the beam scanning makes it hard to use and less stable; it also takes more time to acquire images for one plane than selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM). In this report, we present a recent effort to use a spatial light modulator (SLM) to provide spatial modulation in SPIM. With the SLM, both of the frequency and phase of lateral modulation can be changed rapidly; moreover, this SLM-based SPIM can achieve fast imaging without mechanical moving parts.

It has been successfully applied to recording high-resolution three-dimensional fluorescence images of biological specimens without the need for scanning. In this study, we revealed and analyzed an intrinsic phenomenon, called ghost lens effect, on spatial light modulator which is the core element enabling the incoherent correlation in the FINCHSCOPE. The ghost lens effect can degrade the imaging quality by introducing multiple spherical waves with different focal lengths into the correlation and thus increasing the noise in the recorded holograms.

The effects of gender and very short-term resistance training on peak torque, average power and neuromuscular responses of the forearm flexors								ISOKINETICS AND EXERCISE SCIENCE				22	2			123	130		10.3233/IES-130528			2014	2014	OBJECTIVE: This study examined the effects of gender on peak torque (PT), average power (AP), and the time (AMP) and frequency (MPF) domain parameters of the electromyographic (EMG) and mechanomyographic (MMG) signals following very short-term resistance training (VST) of the forearm flexors. Based on the results of previous studies it was hypothesized that three training sessions would increase PT, EMG MPF, and MMG MPF of the forearm flexors at 60 and 180 degrees/s in men only, without changes to AP, EMG AMP, or MMG AMP for either men or women.METHODS: Nine men and nine women completed two pretests, three training sessions, and a posttest that included concentric isokinetic muscle actions of the forearm flexors at 60 and 180 degrees/s. The AMP and MPF of the EMG and MMG signals were recorded from the biceps brachii.RESULTS: The results indicate increases in PT, AP, and MMG AMP at 60 and 180 degrees/s for the men only, but no changes in EMG AMP, EMG MPF, or MMG MPF for either the men or women.CONCLUSION: There were gender differences in the PT and AP responses to VST of the forearm flexors that were not associated with increased agonist muscle activation. These findings have implications for the development of gender-specific VST programs for the forearm flexors in clinical settings.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0959-3020	1878-5913		WOS:000336659100005

However, during the early stage of cell culture in which sarcomeric additions occur, the neonatal cardiomyocytes that we have been working with are very sensitive to photodamage, the resulting high rate of cell death prevents systematic study of sarcomeric addition using a conventional SHG system. To address this challenge, we introduced use of the pulse-splitter system developed by Na Ji et al. in our two photon excitation fluorescence (TPEF) and SHG hybrid microscope. The system dramatically reduced photodamage to neonatal cardiomyocytes in early stages of culture, greatly increasing cell viability. Thus continuous imaging of live cardiomyocytes was achieved with a stronger laser and for a longer period than has been reported in the literature. The pulse splitter-based TPEF-SHG microscope constructed in this study was demonstrated to be an ideal imaging system for sarcomeric addition-related investigations of neonatal cardiomyocytes in early stages of culture.

Multimode optical fibers are tapered to outer diameter of 4 to 20 mu m. Femtosecond laser pulses are used to form nanostructures on the cleaved endface of the microfiber tip. This endface is then activated by silver sputter coating. To confine the excitation and reflection signal within the tapered core of the microfiber tip, the probe is side-coated with silver plating. High quality SERS signal of Rhodamine 6G molecules is detected through back excitation and collection from a lead in fiber of up to several meters long. The small size of the SERS micro-probe is promising for intra-cellular or even single cell detection, while the back excitation and collection setup make it suitable for remote sensing applications.

As2S3 may be thermally deposited to form glassy films of molecular chalcogenide (ChG) clusters. It has been shown that linear and multi-photon exposure can be used to photo-pattern thermally deposited As2S3. Photo-exposure cross-links the film into a network solid. Treating the photo-patterned material with a polar-solvent removes the unexposed material leaving behind a structure that is a negative-tone replica of the photo-pattern. In this work, nano-structure arrays were photo-patterned in As2S3 films by multi-photon direct laser writing (DLW) and the resulting structure, morphology, and chemical composition were characterized and correlated with the conditions of the thermal deposition, patterned irradiation, and etch processing. Raman spectroscopy was used to characterize the chemical structure of the unexposed and photo-exposed material, and near infrared ellipsometry was used to measure the refractive index. Physical characterization including structure size and surface adhesion of nano-scale features is related to the processing conditions.

Applying three photogrammetric methods - craniovertebral angle, head title angle and head position angle - to measure FHP objectively.RESULTS: One - way ANOVA test showed a significant difference in three categorized group's craniovertebral angle (P < 0.05, F = 83.07). There was no dramatic difference in head tilt angle and head position angle methods in three groups. According to Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA) results, the canonical discriminant function (Wilks'Lambda) was 0.311 for craniovertebral angle with 79.5% of cross-validated grouped cases correctly classified.CONCLUSION: Our results showed that, craniovertebral angle method may discriminate the females with moderate-severe and non FHP more accurate than head position angle and head tilt angle. The photogrammetric method had excellent inter and intra rater reliability to assess the head and cervical posture.									9	0	0	1	0	9			1053-8127	1878-6324		WOS:000336458300004	23963268

Utilizing optimization techniques, three distinct configurations are formulated that differ in sequence of coupling and uncertainty quantification campaigns. Focusing on a controlled structural dynamics problem, the systematic biases from the constituents are quantified, from which the critical components of the model that require further improvement can be identified to aid in the prioritization of future code development efforts.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0887-3801	1943-5487		WOS:000333446100015

Optimal Agency Bias and Regulatory Review								JOURNAL OF LEGAL STUDIES				43	1			95	135		10.1086/675258			JAN 1 2014	2014	Why do bureaucratic principals appoint agents who hold different policy views from themselves? We posit an explanation based on the interplay between two types of agency costs: shirking on information production and policy bias. Principals employ biased agents because they shirk less. This creates an incentive for the principal to use review mechanisms that mitigate the resulting bias in the agents' decisions. The availability of such review mechanisms encourages principals to employ more extreme agents. We apply the theory to explain various features of the administrative state. In contrast to existing accounts, in our model the use by the president of ideological bureaucrats at regulatory agencies and centralized regulatory review are complements. The use of bias to mitigate shirking results in an amplification of the swings of regulatory policy and heightens the role of regulatory policy in partisan politics.									10	0	0	0	0	10			0047-2530	1537-5366		WOS:000333564800004

We developed a disordered glass optical fiber from a porous artisan glass (satin quartz). The refractive index profile of the disordered glass optical fiber is composed of a non-uniform distribution of air voids which can be approximated as longitudinally invariant. The fill-fraction of air voids is higher at the regions closer to the boundary compared with the central regions. The experimental results show that the beam radius of a localized beam is smaller at the regions closer to the boundary than the one at the central regions. In order to understand the reason behind these observations, the fully vectorial modes of the disordered glass fiber are calculated using the actual scanning electron microscope image of the fiber tip. The numerical calculations show that the modes at regions closer to the boundary of the fiber are more localized compared with the modes at the central regions. Coupling of an input beam to the less-localized modes with large tails at the central regions of the fiber results in a large beam radius. In comparison, a beam of light launched at the regions close to the boundary couples to the highly compact modes of the fiber and results in a small localized beam radius.

Persistence is characterized by the phenotypic tolerance of a subpopulation of bacterial cells to antibiotics. Characterization of these "persister" cells is often difficult due to the transient, non-heritable nature of the phenotype and due to the presence of contaminating material from non-persisting cells, which usually comprise the larger fraction. In this study, we use 3D carbon-electrode arrays for dielectrophoresis-based separation of intact cells from damaged cells, revealed by differential staining with propidium iodide, and we use this procedure to purify intact cells from cultures of Mycobacterium smegmatis treated with isoniazid, a frontline anti-tuberculosis drug. The method presented in this study could be used for rapid label-free enrichment of intact persister cells from antibiotic-treated cultures while preserving the metastable persister phenotype. This approach would facilitate the downstream analysis of low-frequency subpopulations of cells using conventional omics techniques, such as transcriptomic and proteomic analysis.									16	0	0	8	0	16			1473-0197	1473-0189		WOS:000335925400009	24756475

We propose, analyze, and test a scheme for these models that has each of these properties for the case of homogeneous Dirichlet velocity boundary conditions. There are several important components of the derivation, both at the continuous and discrete levels, which allow for these properties to hold. The proofs of stability and convergence are carried out through the use of a special choice of test function and some technical estimates. Numerical tests are provided that confirm the effectiveness of the scheme.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0036-1429	1095-7170		WOS:000335818000005

Teacher's knowledge/observational skills and observed instructional support behaviors with children were assessed in the fall and spring over a two-year period. During this time, the teachers were also randomized into a college course focused on interactions, then re-randomized into a coaching intervention, also focused on instructional interaction. Cross-lagged analyses suggest that prior observed behavior was the stronger predictor of change in both knowledge/observation skills and in later observed behavior, and that both the course and the coaching interventions contributed to improvements in teachers observed instructional support behavior. Mediational analyses of the course effects indicated longer-term impact on observed instructional behavior were through immediate impacts on those same behaviors, whereas long-term impacts on knowledge were through immediate impacts on both observed instructional behavior and knowledge. The results have implications for the design, delivery, and focus of professional development for early childhood educators. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

J	Carden, Stephen								Convergence of a Q-learning Variant for Continuous States and Actions								JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH				49				705	731					2014	2014	This paper presents a reinforcement learning algorithm for solving infinite horizon Markov Decision Processes under the expected total discounted reward criterion when both the state and action spaces are continuous. This algorithm is based on Watkins' Q-learning, but uses Nadaraya-Watson kernel smoothing to generalize knowledge to unvisited states. As expected, continuity conditions must be imposed on the mean rewards and transition probabilities. Using results from kernel regression theory, this algorithm is proven capable of producing a Q-value function estimate that is uniformly within an arbitrary tolerance of the true Q-value function with probability one. The algorithm is then applied to an example problem to empirically show convergence as well.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1076-9757	1943-5037		WOS:000335436100001

This study collected motivational, participation, and demographic data from 712 individuals who shop at farmers' markets, subscribe to community supported agriculture (CSA) programs, or do not participate in either. The results indicate that environmental and nutritional motives were the top two factors affecting farmers' market and CSA participants' engagement, while also highlighting a significant association between the CSA and farmers' market participants and privilege variables. These findings suggest that even as farmers' markets and CSAs are promoted as a means to reduce food insecurity and promote agrileisure opportunities, barriers exist that exclude many from engagement.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0022-2216	2159-6417		WOS:000335202100005

It combines the existing scattering coefficient model and spectral domain OCT to achieve method of early diagnosis of colorectal polyp in hospitals. Seventeen patients were studied, and a total of 1456 data points were extracted by curve-fitting the OCT signals into a confocal single-backscattering model. The results show that the mean scattering coefficient value for colorectal polyps is 1.91 mm(-1) (std: +/- 0.54 mm(-1)), which is between the values for normal and malignant tissues. In addition, we studied the difference between adenomatous polyps (n = 15) and inflammatory polyps (n = 2) quantitatively and found that the adenomatous tissues had lower scattering coefficients than the inflammatory ones. The quantitative measurements confirmed that OCT can be used in primary diagnosis to compensate for the deficiencies in methods of pathological diagnosis, with a great potential for early diagnosis of tissues.									1	0	0	1	0	1			2314-6133	2314-6141		WOS:000334843400001

To quantify optical coherence tomography (OCT) images for diagnosis, the tissue's scattering coefficient is estimated by curve fitting the OCT signals to a confocal single backscattering mode. The results from a group of 30 mice show that the scattering coefficients of bone, skin, liver, brain, testis, and spleen can be categorized into three groups: a scattering coefficient between 1.947 and 2.134mm(-1): bone and skin; a scattering coefficient between 1.303 and 1.461mm(-1): liver and brain; a scattering coefficient between 0.523 and 0.634 mm(-1): testis and spleen. The results indicate that the scattering coefficient is tissue specific and could be used in tissue diagnosis.									2	0	0	2	0	2			2314-6133	2314-6141		WOS:000335030400001

Interestingly, the presence of defects throws open new possibilities in the case of nanostructures due to the properties related to their limited size scale. Defects and disorders which alter the electronic structure of nanostructures can significantly influence their electronic, magnetic and nonlinear optical properties. Here, we show that defect engineering is an effective strategy for tailoring the nonlinear optical (NLO) properties of carbon and ZnO nanostructures. The effects of surface states, lattice disorders, polycrystalline interfaces and heterogeneous dopants on the nonlinear absorption behaviour of these nanostructures are discussed in detail. Realistic tunable NLO features achieved by controlling such defects enhance the scope of these nanostructures in device applications such as optical limiting, optical switching, pulse shaping, pulse compression and optical diode action.									11	1	0	0	0	11			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000334602900002	24654002

The aliphatic moiety of the lipid adsorbs strongly to the hydrophobic PP surface, with the hydrophilic active head groups orienting themselves toward the more polar mobile phase, thus allowing for interactions with the desired solutes. Initial proof-of-concept was achieved by adsorbing a biotin-poly(ethylene glycol)-functionalized lipid to the surface of the PP C-CP fibers. Surface modification and uniformity was evaluated by binding streptavidin labeled with Texas Red (SAv-TR) to the biotin moiety. Isolation of SAv-TR from a mixture in neat buffer and in cleared lysate demonstrated the capability of the modified fibers to extract an analyte of interest from a complex viscous mixture. It is believed that this surface modification approach is generally applicable to a diversity of selective protein immobilization applications, including clinical diagnostics and preparative scale HPLC on C-CP fibers as well as to other hydrophobic supports.									10	0	0	5	0	10			0003-2654	1364-5528		WOS:000334176400010	24503581

Every southeastern forested wetland has the potential to be struck by a tropical cyclone. We examined the impact of Hurricane Hugo on two paired coastal South Carolina watersheds in terms of streamflow and vegetation dynamics, both before and after the hurricane's passage in 1989. The study objectives were to quantify the magnitude and timing of changes including a reversal in relative streamflow difference between two paired watersheds, and to examine the selective impacts of a hurricane on the vegetative composition of the forest. We related these impacts to their potential contribution to change watershed hydrology through altered evapotranspiration processes. Using over 30 years of monthly rainfall and streamflow data we showed that there was a significant transformation in the hydrologic character of the two watersheds - a transformation that occurred soon after the hurricane's passage. We linked the change in the rainfall-runoff relationship to a catastrophic change in forest vegetation due to selective hurricane damage. While both watersheds were located in the path of the hurricane, extant forest structure varied between the two watersheds as a function of experimental forest management techniques on the treatment watershed. We showed that the primary damage was to older pines, and to some extent larger hardwood trees. We believe that lowered vegetative water use impacted both watersheds with increased outflows on both watersheds due to loss of trees following hurricane impact. However, one watershed was able to recover to pre hurricane levels of evapotranspiration at a quicker rate due to the greater abundance of pine seedlings and saplings in that watershed.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1027-5606	1607-7938		WOS:000334501700017

A copula- based precipitation forecasting model: Investigating the interdecadal modulation of ENSO's impacts on monthly precipitation								WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH				50	1			580	600		10.1002/2013WR013763			JAN 2014	2014	The influence of two large-scale circulation patterns (the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)), and the effect of the interdecadal modulation of ENSO on precipitation in the state of Texas, U.S., was explored. Texas, by virtue of its size, topography, and geographical location, spans a wide range of climatic regions. The state is divided into 10 climate divisions. The precipitation pattern in each division follows different probability distributions. The climate regimes which trigger this difference are discussed. The seasonal correlation between ENSO and PDO with precipitation anomaly in each climate division was established. Copula-based models were developed to examine the dependence structure between the large-scale climate indices and average monthly seasonal precipitation. The choice of copula is discussed in light of the dependence structure. The selected copulas were then used to simulate precipitation anomalies in three climate divisions: one which has a semiarid climate, one located in the wettest region, and one straddling the subtropical humid and subtropical subhumid regions of the state. The statistical performance of bivariate models for ENSO and precipitation, and trivariate models for ENSO, PDO, and precipitation, in simulating precipitation anomalies were compared. In general, inclusion of PDO was found to improve simulation results. The most notable improvement was in simulating negative precipitation anomalies during La Nina and negative PDO. The copula models were also tested for their abilities to predict precipitation anomalies in these three regions. Again, the trivariate models performed better, especially in predicting droughts due to La Nina and negative PDO.Key Points<list list-type="bulleted"> Influence of ENSO and PDO on precipitation Copula-based precipitation forecasting models Information on the state of PDO improves precipitation forecasting									10	0	0	1	0	10			0043-1397	1944-7973		WOS:000331798800039

Unfortunately, the use of BZY as a separation membrane has been greatly restrained by its highly refractory nature, poor grain boundary proton conductivity, high number of grain boundaries resulting from limited grain growth during sintering, as well as low electronic conductivity. These problems can be resolved by the fabrication of a Ni-BZY composite membrane with large BZY grains, which requires the development of a sinteractive Ni-BaZr0.8Y0.2O3-delta materials system. In this work, Ni-BZY composite membranes have been fabricated by three methods: (i) a combined EDTA-citric method, (ii) a solid state reactive sintering method, and (iii) a solid state reaction method. The effects of different fabrication methods on the sintering activity, microstructure, and phase composition have been systematically investigated by dilatometry, scanning electron microscopy, and powder X-ray diffraction. After reduction, only Ni-BZY membranes prepared through the solid state reaction method were observed to be dense with large BZY grains (similar to 1 mu m). It has been found that the densification and grain growth of Ni-BZY composite membranes were controlled by the method and sequence of NiO introduction during composite membrane processing. After process optimization, a 0.44 mm-thick Ni-BZY dense composite membrane was fabricated using the solid state reaction method which exhibited a hydrogen flux of 4.3 x 10(-8) mol cm(-2) s(-1) in wet 40% H-2 at 900 degrees C, significantly higher than those of non-BaCeO3-based hydrogen separation membranes.									12	0	0	0	0	12			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000333524800035

Attachment/detachment hysteresis of fiber-based magnetic grabbers								SOFT MATTER				10	16			2816	2824		10.1039/c3sm53025f			2014	2014	We developed an experimental protocol to analyze the behaviour of a model fiber-based magnetic grabber. A fiber is vertically suspended and fixed to the substrate by its upper end. A magnetic droplet is attached to the free end of the fiber and when a permanent magnet approaches the droplet, the fiber is forced to bow and finally jumps to the magnet. It appears that one can flex the micro-fibers by very small micro or even nano-Newton forces. Using this setup, we discovered a hysteresis of fiber attachment/detachment: the pathway of the fiber jumping to and off the magnet depends on the distance between the magnet and the clamped end. This phenomenon was successfully explained by the Euler-Benoulli model of an elastic beam. The observed hysteresis of fiber attachment/detachment was attributed to the multiple equilibrium configurations of the fiber tip placed in a dipole-type magnetic field.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1744-683X	1744-6848		WOS:000333524300012	24668160

Understanding of the anatomical features and origins of crown buds and bud clusters, and plant ontogeny, the morphological features of crown buds, and their associated development is required to achieve manipulation of bud initiation, emergence, and development. Anatomical features of the crown bud clusters were examined using both light and confocal microscopy using hybrids of Gentiana triflora x G. scabra. The initiation of bud clusters presented characteristics typical of adventitious buds in terms of their origin and presence of external vascular connection to the parental tissue. In contrast, crown buds forming subsequently within the cluster developed as axillary buds within that initial bud, collectively forming on a compact stem with minimal internode elongation. Stem elongation within the cluster after application of gibberellic acid enabled identification of a hierarchical arrangement of buds within the cluster with one bud at each node and arranged spirally at 90 degrees. Arrangements of buds within the cluster were different from the opposite decussate phyllotaxis in floral shoots with two axillary buds at each node. Based on the current study, a crown bud cluster originated from a first bud initial, which was adventitious followed by development of subsequent crown buds within the cluster as axillary buds from this first bud initially with a single bud developing at each node.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0003-1062	2327-9788		WOS:000333230500002

The nanofoams are fabricated via a two-step procedure. First, the "grafting to" technique is used to obtain a 20-200 nm anchored and cross-linked poly(glycidyl methacrylate) film. Second, the film is swollen in solvent and freeze dried until the solvent is sublimated. The grafted nanofoam possesses the behavior of a shape-memory material, exhibiting gradual mechanical contraction at the nanometer scale as temperature is increased. Both the thickness and shape-recovery ratio of the nanofoam have a close to linear dependency on temperature. We also demonstrated that by modification of the poly(glycidyl methacrylate) nanofoam with grafting low molecular weight polymers, one can tune an absolute nanoscale mechanical response of the porous polymer film.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1744-683X	1744-6848		WOS:000333116700009	24647850

Using this approach, we covalently attached ampicillin (AMP) to polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) substrates. As a result, high efficacy against microbial film formation, manifested by efficient antimicrobial activity against S. aureus with a 97-99.8% decrease of bacterial growth, was achieved. This simple and clean process allows functionalization of any polymeric substrate without adverse effects on bulk polymer properties.									3	0	0	1	0	3			2050-750X	2050-7518		WOS:000333095000002

Covalent attachment of multilayers (CAM): a platform for pH switchable antimicrobial and anticoagulant polymeric surfaces								BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE				2	4			512	521		10.1039/c3bm60238a			2014	2014	These studies show covalent attachment of multilayers (CAM) to chemically alter surfaces to achieve pH switchable antimicrobial and anticoagulant properties. Polyethylene (PE), poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE), and silicon (Si) surfaces were functionalized by tethering pH-responsive "switching" polyelectrolytes consisting of poly(2-vinyl pyridine) (P2VP) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) terminated with NH2 and COOH groups, respectively. At pH < 2.3, the P2VP segments are protonated and expended, but at pH > 5.5, they collapse while the PAA segments are expanded. The presence of terminal NH2 or COOH moieties on P2VP and PAA, respectively, facilitated the opportunity for covalently bonding ampicillin (AMP) and heparin (HEP) to both polyelectrolyte chains. Such surfaces, when exposed to S. aureus, inhibit the growth of microbial films (AMP) as well as anticoagulant properties (HEP). Comparison of "dynamic" pH dependent surfaces developed in these studies with "static" surfaces terminated with (AMP) entities shows significant enhancement in the longevity of surface activity against microbial film formation.									3	0	0	1	0	3			2047-4830	2047-4849		WOS:000332453100007

There was low incidence of tibial radiolucent lines, excellent functional outcomes, and no complications associated with stem modularity. The findings were comparable to the historical control study involving 107TKA with a nonmodular tibial stem design. When using surface cemented tibial components combined with a constrained polyethylene bearing, modular stems appear to be a viable option for primary TKA when adequate fixation and rotational stability are maintained.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2090-3464			MEDLINE:24669319	24669319

MEAT SCIENCE AND MUSCLE BIOLOGY SYMPOSIUM-Anabolic implants and meat quality								JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE				92	1			3	9		10.2527/jas.2013-7088			JAN 2014	2014	Anabolic implants are routinely used in the finishing phase of beef production to improve animal performance and feed efficiency. Implanting during the feedlot phase on average increases ADG 18%, feed intake 6%, feed efficiency 8%, carcass weight 5%, and ribeye area 4% compared with nonimplanted controls. Implants reduce the cost of beef production, which is important given current high feed costs and beef prices. In a 1996 review of 37 implant trials, the use of a combination (i.e., estrogenic and trenbolone acetate) implant increased returns by US$77/head compared with nonimplanted steers. If calculated using today's prices, a combination implant would increase returns by $163/head. However, concerns about potential negative effects of implants on marbling scores, quality grades, and tenderness exist. Changes in Warner-Bratzler shear force values of steaks from implanted steers are small (<0.5 kg) and appear related to an increase in initial tenderness, possibly due to hypertrophy of muscle fiber, instead of alterations in postmortem proteolysis. The increase in ribeye size observed with implanting may also reduce marbling scores through a dilution effect. The impact of anabolic implants on gene expression has shown that implanting downregulates expression of certain lipogenic genes (e. g., stearoyl-CoA desaturase, fatty acid synthetase, fatty acid elongase-6) in steers with low quality grades (Select-) but not in implanted steers with high quality grades (Choice-). Examination of the adipocyte's transcriptome has shown that 36 genes were differentially expressed due to implant treatment. More research is needed to further determine how anabolic implants alter lipogenic gene expression to address changes in marbling deposition with implant usage. Given our current high feed costs and cattle prices, anabolic implants are one of the most cost-effective technologies that can be used in beef production systems.

Neomycin and pentagalloyl glucose enhanced cross-linking for elastin and glycosaminoglycans preservation in bioprosthetic heart valves								JOURNAL OF BIOMATERIALS APPLICATIONS				28	5			757	766		10.1177/0885328213479047			JAN 2014	2014	Glutaraldehyde cross-linked bioprosthetic heart valves fail within 12-15 years of implantation due to limited durability. Glutaraldehyde does not adequately stabilize extracellular matrix components such as glycosaminoglycans and elastin, and loss of these components could be a major cause of degeneration of valve after implantation. We have shown earlier that neomycin-based cross-linking stabilizes glycosaminoglycans in the tissue but fails to stabilize elastin component. Here, we report a new treatment where neomycin and pentagalloyl glucose (PGG) were incorporated into glutaraldehyde cross-linking neomycin-PGG-Glutaraldehyde (NPG) to stabilize both glycosaminoglycans and elastin in porcine aortic valves. Invitro studies demonstrated a marked increase in extracellular matrix stability against enzymatic degradation after cross-linking and 10 month storage in NPG group when compared to glutaraldehyde controls. Tensile properties showed increased lower elastic modulus in both radial and circumferential directions in NPG group as compared to glutaraldehyde, probably due to increased elastin stabilization with no changes in upper elastic modulus and extensibility. The enhanced extracellular matrix stability was further maintained in NPG-treated tissues after rat subdermal implantation for three weeks. NPG group also showed reduced calcification when compared to glutaraldehyde controls. We conclude that NPG cross-linking would be an excellent alternative to glutaraldehyde cross-linking of bioprosthetic heart valves to improve its durability.									3	0	0	1	0	3			0885-3282	1530-8022		WOS:000328880600011	24371208

Participants (n = 78) completed a self-administered survey assessing stigma consciousness, attitudes toward obese people, BMI, and perceived nutrition competence. Weight-related stigma consciousness was not related to nutrition competence, but BMI and attitudes toward obese people were. Individuals with lower BMI and more negative attitude toward obese people had higher perceived nutrition competence. The results present a little-studied area of the effects of attitudes on healthy behavior and should be considered within the context of a weight loss program.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0883-5691	1550-5146		WOS:000367225000002

Therefore, shape can be a specific marker in label-free particle and cell separation for various chemical and biological applications. We demonstrate in this work a continuous-flow electrical sorting of spherical and peanut-shaped particles of similar volumes in an asymmetric double-spiral microchannel. It exploits curvature-induced dielectrophoresis to focus particles to a tight stream in the first spiral without any sheath flow and subsequently displace them to shape-dependent flow paths in the second spiral without any external force. We also develop a numerical model to simulate and understand this shape-based particle sorting in spiral microchannels. The predicted particle trajectories agree qualitatively with the experimental observation. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.									11	1	0	3	0	11			1932-1058			WOS:000332079900003	24753722

The reported studies covered many aspects of carbon dots, from the development of many new synthetic methodologies to an improved mechanistic elucidation and to the exploration of application opportunities, especially for those in the fluorescence imaging of cells and tissues. There have also been significant advances in the establishment of a shared mechanistic framework for carbon dots and other carbon-based quantum dots, graphene quantum dots in particular. In this article, representative recent studies for more efficient syntheses of better-performing carbon dots are highlighted along with results from explorations of their various bioimaging applications in vitro and in vivo. Similar fluorescence properties and potential imaging uses of some graphene quantum dots are also discussed, toward a more consistent and uniform understanding of phenomenologically different carbon-based quantum dots.									89	3	0	11	1	91			2046-2069			WOS:000332061900044

Sharpening the surface of magnetic paranematic droplets								SOFT MATTER				10	12			1917	1923		10.1039/c3sm52655k			2014	2014	In a non-uniform magnetic field, the droplets of colloids of nickel nanorods and nanobeads aggregate to form a cusp at the droplet surface not deforming the entire droplet shape. When the field is removed, nanorods diffuse away and the cusp disappears. Spherical particles can form cusps in a similar way, but they stay aggregated after the release of the field; finally, the aggregates settle down to the bottom of the drop. The X-ray phase contrast imaging reveals that nanorods in the cusps stay parallel to each other without visible spatial order of their centers of mass. The formation of cusps can be explained with a model that includes magnetostatic and surface tension forces. The discovered possibility of controlled assembly and quenching of nanorod orientation under the cusped liquid surface offers vast opportunities for alignment of carbon nanotubes, nanowires and nanoscrolls, prior to spinning them into superstrong and multifunctional fibers. Magnetostatic and electrostatic analogies suggest that a similar ideal alignment can be achieved with the rod-like dipoles subject to a strong electric field.									6	0	0	1	0	6			1744-683X	1744-6848		WOS:000332463300006	24800272

For this, we conducted surveys and interviews of students participating in both the traditional domestic version of a capstone course at Clemson University and a group of students that participated in an international, study abroad version of a capstone course jointly administered by Clemson University and West Virginia University. The surveys were given to students before and after the program to assess whether the international component had an impact on their global awareness when compared to their peers in the traditional domestic program. The surveys, due to the low sample size available from only a dozen participating students, are augmented with interviews conducted at the end of the international program. The findings suggest that there is not a significant change in recognized attributes of global awareness for the population, but there was some movement within individuals. It is also seen that the reasons for participation in the international version of the course varied widely from a desire for international experience to the desire to graduate during the summer sessions when the only capstone option was the international version. The findings begin to provide justification for the international option based on some improvements with global awareness, but additional investigation is warranted as existing programs are continued and new programs introduced.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION				30	1	SI		136	149					2014	2014	The purpose of this paper is to examine in detail the roles that families, particularly parents, play in the academic and career choices of students majoring in engineering at the undergraduate level, with a particular emphasis on how roles may differ when considering the parental level of education. Previous studies have reported the various influences on students' decisions to enter and persist in engineering at the undergraduate level. Though the role of the family has been identified as an important influence, there remains a limited understanding of specific family roles. In this large qualitative study design, the authors use constructivist epistemology, an emergent design, and a basic interpretive approach. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a sample of 118 engineering undergraduates enrolled at two universities and representing diversity in parental educational attainment. Based upon interview transcripts, six distinct family roles were identified in participants' academic and career choices. Variations in certain family roles were found with parental educational attainment. This study is innovative in that it significantly contributes to the knowledge base of family, especially parental, influences on engineering students by including the previously under-explored factor of parental educational attainment. Findings are synthesized into recommendations for developing recruitment and retention interventions for engineering undergraduates, particularly students with little or no familial experience with higher education.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0949-149X			WOS:000331786900016

Embryonic arsenic exposure reduces the number of muscle fibers in killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus)								AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY				146				196	204		10.1016/j.aquatox.2013.11.010			JAN 2014	2014	Arsenic is a contaminant of drinking water and has been correlated with adverse developmental outcomes such as low birth weight, reduced weight gain, and altered locomotor activity. Previous research has shown that killifish (Fundulus heteroditus) exposed to high arsenic levels during embryogenesis had smaller muscle fiber diameters. The current study was designed to determine whether changes in muscle fibers persisted, were exacerbated, or resolved over time. Killifish embryos were exposed to 0-5 ppm arsenite and, upon hatching, were transferred into either clean water or continued receiving the same exposure to arsenic for uP to 16 weeks. Arsenic significantly decreased the weight of both embryonic-only exposed juveniles and continuously exposed juveniles between 4 and 16 weeks of development at concentrations as low as 0.8 ppm. Although arsenite exposure increased the percentage of small diameter fibers during the early weeks, fiber diameters returned to control levels in the embryonic-only exposed fish. However, muscle fiber density was still reduced to 85.7%, 80.3%, and 73.8% of control for the 0.8, 2, and 5 ppm embryonic-only exposure groups, respectively, even after 16 weeks of development. These results indicate that while continuous exposure to arsenic may alter the size of muscle fibers, embryonic-only exposure to arsenic has lasting effects on the number of muscle fibers formed.

The paper develops a generic stability and optimality framework within which the energy management problem is cast in the form of a nonlinear optimal regulation (with disturbance rejection) problem and a control Lyapunov function is used to design the control law. Two theorems ensuring optimality and asymptotic stability of the energy management strategy are proposed and proved. The sufficient conditions for optimality and stability are used to derive an analytical expression for the control law as a function of the battery state of charge/state of energy and system parameters. The control law is implemented in a simplified backward vehicle simulator and its performance is evaluated against the global optimal solution obtained from dynamic programming. The strategy performs within 4% of the benchmark solution while guaranteeing optimality and stability for any driving cycle. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Three transport modes are considered: truck, single railcar, and unit train. The goal is to minimize the total cost for infrastructure, feedstock harvesting, biofuel production, and transportation. Strategic decisions including the locations and capacities of transshipment hubs, biorefineries, and terminals and tactical decisions on system operations are optimized in an integrated manner. When the model was implemented to a case study of cellulosic ethanol production in California, it was found that trucks are convenient for short-haul deliveries while rails are more effective for long-haul transportation. Taking the advantage of these benefits, the multimodal transport provides more cost effective solutions than the single-mode transport (truck). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Improved understanding of how attention to sustainability influences student major and career choice could inform efforts to broaden participation in engineering. PurposeTwo related questions guided our research. How do career outcome expectations related to sustainability predict the choice of an engineering career? Which broader sustainability-related outcomes do students perceive as related to engineering? To address both questions, we compared effects for engineering and nonengineering students while controlling for various confounding variables. Design/MethodWe conducted a survey to collect responses about sustainability and other variables of interest from a national sample of college students in introductory English classes. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and correlational analysis. ResultsStudents who hope to address certain sustainability issues such as energy, climate change, environmental degradation, and water supply are more likely to pursue engineering. Those who hope to address other sustainability issues such as opportunities for women and minorities, poverty, and disease are less likely to do so. Students hoping to address sustainability-related outcome expectations with obvious human relevance are less likely to pursue engineering. Yet those students who perceive "improving quality of life" and "saving lives" as associated with engineering are more likely to pursue the profession. ConclusionsOur results suggest that showing students the connection between certain sustainability issues and engineering careers could help those striving to increase and diversify participation in engineering. A broader range of engineers would likely bring new ideas and ways of thinking to engineering for sustainability.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1069-4730	2168-9830		WOS:000331404600007

The Role of Interruptions and Contextual Associations in Delayed-Execute Prospective Memory								APPLIED COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY				28	1			91	103		10.1002/acp.2960			JAN 2014	2014	We conducted three experiments to examine the dynamics of a delayed-execute prospective memory task involving task interruptions. In the delayed-execute paradigm, participants must delay a response until some future condition is met. After an intention was formed to a salient cue, an interruption reduced prospective memory relative to a no-interruption condition. Prospective memory for cues encountered during an interrupting task was worse than for cues occurring before an interruption, but the location of the cue in either the ongoing task or the interruption did not affect prospective memory. Importantly, reinstating the prevailing context after the interruption alleviated the negative influence of the interruption. Providing participants with information about the future context for making the delayed-execute response also alleviated some of these deficits presumably because participants could encode more specific features of the performance context. These results highlight the potential importance of contextual associations and reminders in completing everyday intentions successfully.

The first objective intends to answer the following question which is of significant interest to information system (IS) researchers and practitioners: How does user satisfaction (satisfaction) respond to changes in system use and system attributes? The second and more ambitious objective is to promote the application of economic theories in user behavior research. In contrast to prior research that conceived the development of user satisfaction as an information valuation and integration process, we consider such development to be embedded in the IS consumption process, that is, users gain utility (satisfaction) from consuming (using) the system. This perspective enables us to re-conceptualize user satisfaction as a proxy of utility and apply utility research in economics to study user satisfaction. An economic model of user satisfaction was developed. Two empirical studies were conducted to examine the research model. The findings confirmed the consumptive nature of user satisfaction. Apart from enriching our understanding of user satisfaction, this research demonstrates the usefulness of economic theories in user behavior research. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Efficient energy transfer from the vanadate (VO43-) group or bismuth ions to the rare earth ion has been established by photoluminescence investigation upon UV excitation and results in blue and yellow emissions at 480-489 nm and 572-580 nm respectively. The codoping of Bi3+ and Dy3+ into K3Y (VO4)(2) results in enhanced yellow emission band while the blue emission band remains relatively unchanged. The intensities of emission for the studied materials were investigated as a function of different Bi3+ and Dy3+ ion concentrations.

The gas-and dust dissipation processes in disks around young stars remain uncertain despite numerous studies. At the distance of similar to 99-116 pc, HD 141569A is one of the nearest HerbigAe stars that is surrounded by a tenuous disk, probably in transition between a massive primordial disk and a debris disk. Atomic and molecular gases have been found in the structured 5-Myr old HD 141569A disk, making HD 141569A the perfect object within which to directly study the gaseous atomic and molecular component.Aims. We wish to constrain the gas and dust mass in the disk around HD 141569A.Methods. We observed the fine-structure lines of O I at 63 and 145 mu m and the C II line at 157 mu m with the PACS instrument onboard the Herschel Space Telescope as part of the open-time large program GASPS. We complemented the atomic line observations with archival Spitzer spectroscopic and photometric continuum data, a ground-based VLT-VISIR image at 8.6 mu m, and (CO)-C-12 fundamental ro-vibrational and pure rotational J = 3-2 observations. We simultaneously modeled the continuum emission and the line fluxes with the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code MCFOST and the thermo-chemical code PRODIMO to derive the disk gas-and dust properties assuming no dust settling.Results. The models suggest that the oxygen lines are emitted from the inner disk around HD 141569A, whereas the [C II] line emission is more extended. The CO submillimeter flux is emitted mostly by the outer disk. Simultaneous modeling of the photometric and line data using a realistic disk structure suggests a dust mass derived from grains with a radius smaller than 1 mm of similar to 2.1 x 10(-7) M-circle dot and from grains with a radius of up to 1 cm of 4.9 x 10(-6) M-circle dot. We constrained the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) mass to be between 2 x 10(-11) and 1.4 x 10(-10) M-circle dot assuming circumcircumcoronene (C150H30) as the representative PAH. The associated PAH abundance relative to hydrogen is lower than those found in the interstellar medium (3 x 10(-7)) by two to three orders of magnitude. The disk around HD 141569A is less massive in gas (2.5 to 4.9 x 10-4 M-circle dot or 67 to 164 M.) and has a flat opening angle (<10%).Conclusions. We constrained simultaneously the silicate dust grain, PAH, and gas mass in a similar to 5-Myr old Herbig Ae disk. The disk-averaged gas-to-dust-mass is most likely around 100, which is the assumed value at the disk formation despite the uncertainties due to disagreements between the different gas tracers. If the disk was originally massive, the gas and the dust would have dissipated at the same rate.									21	0	0	0	0	21			0004-6361	1432-0746		WOS:000330584000050

For efficient implementation of hyperelliptic curve cryptosystems, it is crucial to have efficient scalar multiplication in the Jacobian groups. For the hyperelliptic curve C-q : v(2) = u(p) - au - b over the field F-q with q a power of an odd prime p, Duursma and Sakurai (2000) presented a scalar multiplication algorithm for q = p, a = 1 and b is an element of F-p. In this paper, by introducing the concept of simple divisors, we prove that a general divisor can be decomposed into the sum of some simple divisors. Based on this fact, we present a formula for p-scalar multiplications for any reduced divisor, then we give two efficient algorithms to speed up scalar multiplications for any parameters a and b over any extension of F-p. Compared with the signed binary method, the computations of our algorithms cost 55% to 76% less.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0169-2968	1875-8681		WOS:000330906100006

Meso-scale Computational Investigation of Shock-Wave Attenuation by Trailing Release Wave in Different Grades of Polyurea								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				23	1			49	64		10.1007/s11665-013-0760-3			JAN 2014	2014	Over the past several years, considerable research efforts have been made toward investigating polyurea, a segmented thermoplastic elastomer, and particularly its shock-mitigation capacity, i.e., an ability to attenuate and disperse shock-waves. These research efforts have clearly established that the shock-mitigation capacity of polyurea is closely related to its chemistry, processing route, and the resulting microstructure. Polyurea typically possesses a nano-segregated microstructure consisting of (high glass transition temperature, T (g)) hydrogen-bonded discrete hard domains and a (low T (g)) contiguous soft matrix. While the effect of polyurea microstructure on its shock-mitigation capacity is well-established, it is not presently clear what microstructure-dependent phenomena and processes control its shock-mitigation capacity. To help identify these phenomena and processes, meso-scale simulations of the formation of nano-segregated microstructure and its interaction with a leading shock-wave and a trailing release-wave is analyzed in the present work. The results obtained revealed that shock-induced hard-domain densification makes an important contribution to the superior shock-mitigation capacity of polyurea, and that the extent of densification is a sensitive function of the polyurea soft-segment molecular weight. In particular, the ability of release-waves to capture and neutralize shock-waves has been found to depend strongly on the extent of shock-induced hard-domain densification and, thus, on the polyurea soft-segment molecular weight.									9	0	0	0	0	9			1059-9495	1544-1024		WOS:000330209800006

However they tend to suffer from mechanical limitations as compared to more conventional oxide-glass fibers, which impede their further integration into components where high strength is required. Reported here are findings on the mechanical properties of fibers based on the glass As2Se3, with a focus on unraveling how extrinsic impurities embedded in the native preform impact the maximum stress that the resulting fibers can endure. Preforms were prepared and subjected to four levels of purification (standard moisture removal, surface oxide volatilization, and synthesis over AlCl3 getter, followed by distillation) and subsequently drawn into fibers. To effectively decouple the real effect of impurity content on fibers strength from other peripheral parameters, such as manufacturing, handling or aging, each purification protocol was duplicated on one bare fiber and one fiber drawn with a protective coating. Weibull statistics on the strength of As2Se3 fibers were determined in both tension and bending. We demonstrate that coated and uncoated fibers follow a similar trend with purification. Specifically, oxide volatilization treatment increases the fibers resistance to failure, while the addition of AlCl3 getter in the melt without subsequent distillation degrades it. If further distillation is carried out the fibers strength improves only slightly as compared to oxide volatilization treatment alone. These results provide both insights into the interplay between chemical, optical, and mechanical properties as well as practical steps benefiting the continued utility of these glass optical fibers.

The aim of the research was to develop a process to replace the current energy-intensive flash evaporation and make use of this nutrient-rich stream to create a new co-product in the form of protein-rich biomass. Batch experiments in 5- and 50-L stirred bioreactors showed prolific fungal growth under non-sterile conditions. COD, suspended solids, glycerol, and organic acids removals, critical for in-plant water reuse, reached ca. 80%, 98%, 100% and 100%, respectively, within 5 d of fungal inoculation, enabling effluent recycle as process water. R. oligosporus contains 2% lysine, good levels of other essential amino acids, and 43% crude protein - a highly nutritious livestock feed. Avoiding water evaporation from thin stillage would furthermore save substantial energy inputs on corn ethanol plants. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Klotsch) Stock Plant Canopy								HORTSCIENCE				49	1			51	54					JAN 2014	2014	Poinsettia stock plants consist of a dense canopy of competing shoots, and the growth and development of these individual shoots have not been previously quantified. The effects of air temperature, daily light integral (DLI), and canopy density (CD) were investigated on poinsettia (Euphorbia pulcherrima Wild. ex. Klotsch) 'Freedom Red' shoot development in a stock plant canopy. Plants were grown at two constant temperatures (20.3 or 25.7 degrees C), five CD (43, 86, 129, 172, or 215 shoots/m(2)), and three DLI treatments (2.6, 4.4, or 7.7 mol.m(-2).d(-1) for the September planting and 4.0, 6.0, or 10.6 mol.m(2)d(-1) for the January planting). Shoot position at the final data collection was used to assign shoots to different levels within the canopy; Level 1 = the four highest shoots, Level 2 = the next four highest shoots, and so forth for Levels 3, 4, and 5. Temperature did not significantly affect leaf unfolding rate (LUR), shoot fresh mass (FM), or shoot caliper, whereas DLI and CD affected shoot growth and development. LUR and FM increased as DLI increased from 2.6 to 10.6 mol.m(-2.)d(-1), whereas LUR and FM decreased on the uppermost shoots in the canopy, e.g., Level 1 shoots, as CD increased from 43 to 129 shoots/m(2). Therefore, higher CD required higher DLI to achieve similar LUR and FM. Shoot caliper on Level 1 shoots increased from 6.3 to 7.4 mm as CD decreased from 129 to 43 shoots/m(2); and shoot caliper increased from 5.8 to 7.6 mm as DLI increased from 4.0 to 10.6 mol.m(-2.)d(-1). The DLI environment needs to be managed to accommodate greater CD, to sustain growth and development of individual shoots within the canopy of poinsettia stock plants.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0018-5345	2327-9834		WOS:000329771600008

Initiated in Fall 2002, the seminar has explored diverse sustainability topics and reached approximately 150 faculty and students. The paper describes how the course shaped participants' perceptions of sustainability and influenced their viewpoints on interdisciplinarity. The paper discusses the implications of this seminar format for communicating about sustainability and provides suggestions for replicating the course at other institutions.Design/methodology/approach - Information about the course is complemented by analyses of the results of 15 in-depth interviews of students and faculty who have participated in the course.Findings - The course facilitated positive outcomes for students and faculty by expanding their familiarity with interdisciplinary perspectives on sustainability and environmental issues, increasing respect for other disciplinary perspectives, learning the basic vocabulary of disciplines outside their area of expertise, and strengthening collaborations between faculty. The course can be strengthened with more involvement from colleagues from the humanities and social sciences, and with attention to equal participation from all involved.Originality/value - The experience is unique in that it represents a nearly decade-long initiative to teaching about sustainability and biocomplexity from an interdisciplinary perspective. The innovative format, content, and pedagogical approach used for this course can be easily implemented in other disciplines. The learning community has facilitated other teaching and research endeavors. This model of sustainability education can advance understanding of complex environmental issues at a time when both interdisciplinarity and sustainability are becoming more common in higher education.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1467-6370			WOS:000329551000003		
J	Chernykh, Lucy								Dwarf banks								JOURNAL OF BANKING & FINANCE				38				31	40		10.1016/j.jbankfin.2013.09.014			JAN 2014	2014	This study examines the business model and the viability of very small commercial banks in emerging market context. Using a unique sample of 141 Russian banks with less than a $10 million in assets, I trace performance, survival, recapitalization and growth patterns of these dwarf banks in response to the sharp increase in the minimum capital requirements. I find that dwarf banks are, on average, low-risk financial intermediaries that perform simple operations and have significantly higher survival rates in local markets with poor economic and banking services outreach characteristics. I also find that the average dwarf banks withstand the regulatory capital shock surprisingly well by securing fresh capital injection followed by a twofold asset size increase. The results of this study contribute to the literature on the relationship between the small bank business model, local banking markets characteristics and long-term viability. They also provide new evidence on the expected and unexpected outcomes of the "too small to survive" regulatory intervention into the banking market size structures. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

A well-documented case history is adopted in conjunction with PLAXIS, a proprietary finite element code. The simplified approach based on first-order approximation is easy to use, requires less computational work and provides a practical tool to estimate the variation of the wall and ground responses caused by the uncertainty in input parameters. Moreover, to facilitate the numerical analysis, this study also documents a successful implementation of user-defined soil models, including the hyperbolic and the modified pseudoplasticity soil models, into PLAXIS. The results show that PLAXIS, with these user-defined soil models, can capture the laboratory stress-strain relationships and predict, accurately, the wall and ground responses in a braced excavation.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0253-3839	2158-7299		WOS:000329832900001

It is not clear whether females migrate towards estuaries to hatch larvae, as reported for other congeneric shrimps. We tested whether females of M. acanthurus exhibit reproductive migrations. The population dynamics of this shrimp was studied in the Ribeira de Iguape River, Brazil. Four sites that differ in position with respect to the coast were sampled monthly during 2007. In M. acanthurus, reproduction was seasonal and reproductive intensity did not vary among study sites. Females brooding early and late embryos were found at all study sites during the reproductive season. No disappearance of reproductive females was observed at the study site located furthest away (similar to 150km) from the coast. Thus, reproductive females of M. acanthurus do not exhibit reproductive migrations towards estuaries to hatch larvae. Maturity in females was reached at smaller body sizes during the austral summer and spring compared with winter and autumn. Growth rate and body size was sex-specific; males grew slower but attained larger average and final body sizes than females. This information needs to be considered in assessing stocks and establishing sustainable management plans for M. acanthurus in Brazil.									1	0	0	1	1	2			1323-1650	1448-6059		WOS:000328225600008

Nanomedicine uses nanoparticles with diameters in the range of similar to 1-100 nm to encapsulate drugs and target them to tumors. The nanoparticle enhances local drug delivery efficiency to the tumors via entrapment in leaky tumor vasculature, molecular targeting to cells expressing cancer biomarkers, and/or magnetic targeting. In addition, the localization can be enhanced using triggered release in tumors via chemical, thermal, or optical signals. In order to optimize these nanoparticle drug delivery strategies, it is important to be able to image where the nanoparticles distribute and how rapidly they release their drug payloads. This Review aims to evaluate the current state of nanotechnology platforms for cancer theranostics (therapeutic and diagnostic particles) that are capable of noninvasive measurement of release kinetics.									20	1	0	8	0	21			1543-8384			WOS:000329529700003	24215280

Biocompatible, biodegradable multilayered coatings composed of poly(glycolide) (PGA) and poly(lactide) (PLA) were polymerized directly onto hydroxyl-fimctionalized CNT surfaces. Sequential addition of monomers into the reaction vessel enabled multilayered coatings of PLA-PGA or PGA-PLA. Poly(ethylene glycol) capped the polymer chain ends, resulting in a multifunctional amphiphilic coating. Multilayer polymer coatings on CNTs enabled control of the anticancer drug dasatinib's release kinetics and enhanced the in vitro therapeutic efficacy against U-87 glioblastoma compared to monolayer polymer coatings.									5	0	0	3	0	5			1543-8384			WOS:000329529700026	24294824

Multi-sensor fusion based on observations from neighboring vehicles is implemented via binary Bayesian filtering. We prove theoretically that, under appropriate sensor models, the belief of whether there exists an object at every discretized cell in the domain will converge to the true state. An uncertainty map representing the entropies associated with these probabilities is constructed to guide the vehicles' motion for domain exploration. Under the proposed strategies, all objects in the search domain will be detected. Different motion control schemes are numerically tested to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed search strategies.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1561-8625	1934-6093		WOS:000329369000002

The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act mandates states to have policies and procedures in place to prevent inappropriate over identification or disproportionate representation by race and ethnicity of students with disabilities. The purpose of this study was to investigate the current status of minority representation in special education given the mandate and related efforts to reduce overrepresentation and to identify trends for the 5-year period from 2004 to 2008. Growth models were used to analyze trends in national data collected from the 50 states and the District of Columbia for these 5 years. Findings indicate some improvements from 10 years ago, especially noteworthy are a significant decrease in the number of African American students and a moderate decrease in the number of Hispanic students categorized as having intellectual disabilities. However, during the same period, the number of Hispanic students in learning disabilities increased. Otherwise, the trend of racial/ethnic representation in special education remains the same as it was a decade ago.									9	0	0	0	0	9			1062-1024	1573-2843		WOS:000329247100012

For that reason, we address the electrical properties of grafted polymer layers made of poly(glycidyl methacrylate), polyacrylic acid, poly(2-vinylpyridine), and polystyrene with thicknesses of 10-20 nm. It was found that layers insulating under normal ambient conditions can display a significant increase in conductivity as the environment changes. Namely, we demonstrated that the in-plane electrical conductivity of the polymer grafted layers can be changed by at least two orders of magnitude upon exposure to water or organic solvent vapors. Conductive properties of all polymer grafted films under study could also be significantly enhanced with an increase in temperature. The observed phenomenon makes possible the chemical design of polymer nanoscale layers with reduced or enhanced sensitivity to the anticipated change in environmental conditions. Finally, we demonstrated that the observed effects could be used in a micron-sized conductometric transducing scheme for the detection of volatile organic solvents.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000329175700026	24336834

Age-related and psychosocial factors impact older patients' ability to engage effectively in self-care practices. Although self-care processes are the focus of the investigation, few studies provide implications specific for the older adult population. Limited research on heart failure self-care in the older adult meets the age criterion of 65 years or older.Methods: A comprehensive search of the literature was performed using Medline, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library, as well as an ancestry approach of reference lists of selected studies. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trial, qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-method design studies on older adults with heart failure related to self-care for the years 2002-2012.Findings: Three themes of self-care were noted in the selected studies: patient-related factors, patient education, and telemonitoring. The patient-related factors identified were barriers to self-care such as age-related symptoms, cognitive factors, and social issues. The interventions promoting self-care were patient education (self-care knowledge) and telemonitoring (augmenting symptom recognition). Patient education tailored to older adults may be beneficial. Telemonitoring is an appropriate self-care enhancement tool for selected older adults. More emphasis needs to be placed on interventions to assist older adults with heart failure in symptom recognition and early notification of healthcare providers.Conclusions: As the population ages, a need for evidence-based care for older adults with heart failure is warranted. Heart failure self-care interventions do not address the special considerations of the older heart failure patient. To determine the best approaches for promoting effective self-care, older adults with heart failure need to be studied as a cohort.Clinical Relevance: Older adults with heart failure face many challenges engaging in self-care practices. These older adults need individualized self-care instructions and home care follow-up. Identifying special needs of the patient, such as sensory or cognitive impairment, is necessary when providing instructions and follow-up care for the older adult.									7	3	0	1	0	8			0887-6274	1538-9782		WOS:000328936700007	24309574

This review paper addresses nondestructive testing techniques that are used to detect microfacial and subfacial cracks. In this paper, we mainly focused on mono- and polycrystalline silicon PV devices and the root causes of the cracks in solar cells are described. We have categorized these cracks based on size and location in the wafer. The impact of the microcracks on electrical and mechanical performance of silicon solar cells is reviewed. For the first time, we have used the multi-attribute decision-making method to evaluate the different inspection tools that are available on the market. The decision-making tool is based on the analytical hierarchy process and our approach enables the ranking of the inspection tools for PV production stages, which have conflicting objectives and multi-attribute constraints.									11	0	0	0	0	11			2156-3381			WOS:000329038800077

Specifically, an ultrasonic standing wave field was set up between an ultrasonic transducer and a reflector, creating multiple pressure nodes. These nodes are locations where drops collect into what we call accretion disks. Significant increases in the scavenging coefficient were observed when these accretions disks were present. Experiments conducted in the presence of an ultrasonic standing wave field and a water spray yielded scavenging coefficients as large as 140% of those which were obtained using a spray alone. Also, experiments conducted with the ultrasonic field present, but detuned so that accretion disks did not form, showed no significant improvement over the case without ultrasonics at all. The scavenging coefficients are presented as a function of particle diameter and water flow rate. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between novel SNPs in the coding region of bovine HSL gene and carcass and meat quality traits of Chinese Simmental-cross steers. Two novel SNPs were genotyped and the 47 traits of carcass and meat quality traits were measured in the population studied. Statistical analysis revealed that the SNPs of HSL gene were associated with the carcass and meat quality traits. The individuals with TT genotypes of E1-276C > T showed significant higher dressing percentage, net meat rate, hind legs circumference, fat coverage rate, mesenteric fat and kidney fat (p < 0.05). E8-51C > T (P17S) also showed a significant association with the pH of beef and fatty acids content in Chinese Simmental cattle (p < 0.01). Our findings indicated that polymorphisms in HSL might be one of important genetic factors that influence carcass yield and meat quality in beef cattle, and it may be a useful marker for meat quality traits in future marker-assisted selection programs in beef cattle breeding and production.									2	1	0	1	0	3			0301-4851	1573-4978		WOS:000329100500013	24213829

Meniscus formation in a capillary and the role of contact line friction								SOFT MATTER				10	4			609	615		10.1039/c3sm52164h			2014	2014	We studied spontaneous formation of an internal meniscus by dipping glass capillaries of 25 mm to 350 mm radii into low volatile hexadecane and tributyl phosphate. X-ray phase contrast and high speed optical microscopy imaging were employed. We showed that the meniscus completes its formation when the liquid column is still shorter than the capillary radius. After that, the meniscus travels about ten capillary radii at a constant velocity. We demonstrated that the experimental observations can be explained by introducing a friction force linearly proportional to the meniscus velocity with a friction coefficient depending on the air/liquid/solid triplet. It was demonstrated that the friction coefficient does not depend on the capillary radius. Numerical solution of the force balance equation revealed four different uptake regimes that can be specified in a phase portrait. This phase portrait was found to be in good agreement with the experimental results and can be used as a guide for the design of thin porous absorbers.									10	1	0	0	0	11			1744-683X	1744-6848		WOS:000328954900010	24652161

Based on the results of geotechnical tests and a feasibility ground freezing study, a freezing system with a central freeze pipe was installed to target a column of clean sand 1 m in radius and 2.3 m in length. Liquid nitrogen was continuously supplied to the freeze pipe fabricated to freeze the sand between depths of 1.8 and 3.8 m below the ground surface for 270 h. Frozen sand cores taken from five locations 0.65 to 0.7 m away from the central freeze pipe indicate the ground was frozen between depths of 1.8 and 3.8 m at all but one location. Ground temperature measurements, growth of the frozen zone, and the amount of liquid nitrogen consumed are presented and compared with predicted values. Recorded temperatures indicate that the freezing was influenced by the direction of groundwater flow, the flow rate of liquid nitrogen, and the location of the liquid nitrogen inlet pipe within the central freeze pipe.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1090-0241	1943-5606		WOS:000328556900015

The incorporation of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) into spheroids permits the manipulation of spheroids into desired shapes, patterns, and tissues using magnetic forces. Current strategies incorporating MNPs often involve cellular uptake, and should therefore be avoided because it induces adverse effects on cell activity, viability, and phenotype. Here, we report a Janus structure of magnetic cellular spheroids (JMCS) with spatial control of MNPs to form two distinct domains: cells and extracellular MNPs. This separation of cells and MNPs within magnetic cellular spheroids was successfully incorporated into cellular spheroids with various cellular and extracellular compositions and contents. The amount of cells that internalized MNPs was quantified and showed that IMCSs resulted in significantly lower internalization (35%) compared to uptake spheroids (83%, p < 0.05). Furthermore, the addition of MNPs to cellular spheroids using the Janus method has no adverse effects on cellular viability up to seven weeks, with spheroids maintaining at least 82% viability over 7 weeks when compared to control spheroids without MNPs. By safely incorporating MNPs into cellular spheroids, results demonstrated that JMCSs were capable of magnetic manipulation, and that magnetic forces used during magnetic force assembly mediate fusion into controlled patterns and complex tissues. Finally, JMCSs were assembled and fused into a vascular tissue construct 5 mm in diameter using magnetic force assembly. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Little is known about its reproductive biology, and no genetic resources exist despite its growing importance as a fisheries species in the region. Next generation sequencing methods can provide rapid and cost-effective development of molecular markers such as microsatellites, which can be applied to studies of paternity, parentage, and population structure in this understudied species. Here, we used Roche 454 pyrosequencing to develop microsatellite markers in P. elegans and made genomic comparisons of repeat density and repeat class frequency with other arthropods and more distantly related taxa. We identified 13 809 repeats of 16bp, or a density of 9744bp of repeat per megabase queried, which was intermediate in the range of taxonomic groups compared. Comparison of repeat class frequency distributions revealed that P. elegans was most similar to Drosophila melanogaster rather than the more closely related crustacean Daphnia pulex. We successfully isolated 15 polymorphic markers with an average of 9.4 alleles per locus and average observed and expected heterozygosities of 0.501 and 0.597, respectively. Four loci were found to be out of HardyWeinberg equilibrium, likely due to the presence of null alleles. A preliminary population genetic analysis revealed low but significant differentiation between a Peruvian (n 47) and Mexican (n 48) population (F-ST 0.039) and markedly reduced genetic diversity in Peru. These markers should facilitate future studies of paternity, parentage, and population structure in this species.									4	0	0	4	0	4			0022-1503	1465-7333		WOS:000328427800014	24115106

The moisture content, pH, browning intensity, S-allyl cysteine (SAC) content and antioxidant activity, including DPPH radical scavenging activity and reducing power, were determined. The moisture content of garlic gradually decreased throughout the heating process. The rate of moisture removal was higher at high temperatures compared with low temperatures. The pH also decreased more significantly in garlic heated at high temperatures. The browning intensity increased with increasing temperature. The SAC contents of black garlic were significantly different according to heating temperature; the garlic samples heated at a low temperature had a higher SAC contents. Antioxidant activity, as determined by the DPPH radical scavenging activity and reducing power, increased when the garlic was exposed to higher temperatures. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A well-developed Q&A system should incorporate features such as high question response rate, high answer quality, a spam-free environment for users. Previous works use reputation systems to achieve the goals. However, these reputation systems evaluate a user with an overall rating for all questions the user has answered regardless of the question categories, thus the reputation score does not accurately reflect the user's ability to answer a question in a specific category. We propose SmartQ: a reputation based Q&A System. SmartQ employs a category and theme based reputation management system to evaluate users' willingness and capability to answer various kinds of questions. The reputation system facilitates the forwarding of a question to favorable experts, which improves the question response rate and answer quality. Also, SmartQ incorporates a lightweight spammer detection method to identify potential spammers. Our trace-driven simulation on PeerSim demonstrates the effectiveness of SmartQ in providing a good user experience. We then develop a real application of SmartQ and deploy it for use in a student group in Clemson University. The user feedback shows that SmartQ can provide high-quality answers for users in a community.					20th IEEE International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS)20th IEEE International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Systems (ICPADS)	DEC 16-19, 2014DEC 16-19, 2014	IEEE; IEEE Comp SocIEEE; IEEE Comp Soc	Hsinchu, TAIWANHsinchu, TAIWAN	0	0	0	0	0	0			1521-9097		978-1-4799-7615-7	WOS:000393387400094

In a multi-area power system, inter-area flows have to be controlled according to some power purchase agreements and transaction contracts. Automatic generation control (AGC) with knowledge of PV plant generation is introduced for variable tie-line bias control and maximum utilization of PV power in the power system. Typical results to illustrate the proposed real-time tie-line bias control are presented on a two-area four machine power system with a utility-scale PV plant. Furthermore, an analysis of the tie-line power oscillations due to cloud cover and disturbances for different levels of PV power penetration are carried out and the presence of low frequency modes are pointed out.

S	Benson, Lisa; Kirn, Adam; Faber, Courtney June			ASEE					CAREER: Student Motivation and Learning in Engineering								2014 ASEE ANNUAL CONFERENCE		ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition												2014	2014	This study seeks to identify factors that contribute to students' motivation to pursue engineering, and to correlate these motivational attributes to problem-solving and knowledge transfer. Understanding these relationships will address one of the greatest challenges facing engineering educators: preparing students for a future of complex problem solving in the face of rapid technological change and globalization. The study population is drawn from bioengineering (BioE) and mechanical engineering (ME), thus allowing comparisons between two disciplines that have similar content and skill sets but different student demographics and career goals.Quantitative methods were applied to explore differences in motivation for students in different majors in the initial phase of the study. Results showed subtle differences between student motivations in different majors, and indicated the need to explore motivation factors more deeply through mixed methods. Data from a survey on student motivation and problem solving self-efficacy and two interviews (one related to motivation and the other to their problem-solving approaches) were analyzed. The motivation interviews revealed differences in students' perceived future possible selves, which affect their perceptions of the relevance of present activities. Ongoing problem solving interview data analysis will further reveal how motivation differences affect students' actual problem solving practices.

There were two living-learning communities studied: an honors community and a science and engineering community. Students in both communities were enrolled in specific sections of an introductory engineering course designated for them. Students were surveyed at the beginning and end of their first semester on campus while enrolled in the course. The survey used was assessed for construct validity using a series of factor analyses. There were several distinctions between the motivational profiles of students' based on course section type (honors community, science and engineering community, and non-restricted sections of the course). The honors community seems to be attracting their targeted group of students, as students with higher mastery orientation and higher perceptions of their knowledge of cognition. Students in the science and engineering community were not significantly different than those in the non-restricted sections of the course at the beginning of the semester, but did have higher expectancies of success in their engineering course at the end of the semester.

S	Godwin, Allison; Potvin, Geoff; Hazari, Zahra			ASEE					Do Engineers Beget Engineers? Exploring Connections Between the Engineering-related Career Choices of Students and their Families								2014 ASEE ANNUAL CONFERENCE		ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition												2014	2014	There are few studies on how a student's choice of engineering is affected by having an engineer as a family member, yet there are persistent hypotheses about these types of familial influences. Engineering major choice is an important step in the engineering pipeline since paths into engineering are relatively closed after the freshman year. In this work, we explore the influence of familial engineers on students' choice of engineering through a mixed methods approach. The quantitative portion of this study comes from the nationally representative Sustainability and Gender in Engineering (SaGE) survey, completed by 6,772 students enrolled in first-year English courses during Fall 2011. The qualitative data come from seventeen interviews of high school students conducted during in-depth observations at two public U.S. high schools in 2013.A linear regression predicting the likelihood of a an engineering career was constructed with family members' professions and career influence input as predictors, along with controls for students' academic performance, their family's general support for math/science, and their socioeconomic status (SES). From the interview data, students' own narratives about "who has influenced [their] career choice" were coded to triangulate the quantitative data and provide some explanatory power. The results show that siblings or other relatives being an engineer has a stronger positive influence on students' engineering choice than their parents. These results are supported by students' narratives that their "other" family influences are a stronger influence than direct parental influences except for students who reported a strong, positive relationship with a paternal engineering role model. Notably, no gender differences were found in this work.

Future Time Perspective (FTP) and possible selves provided models for how student perceptions of the future can guide their actions in the present. Previously, FTP has been applied in engineering quantitatively to study differences among engineering majors and retention of engineering students; this study extends previous work to include rich descriptions of engineering students' FTPs through qualitative methods. Students were interviewed about their long-term goals and actions taken in the present. Students interviewed (n=9) were at the end of their second year or beginning of their third year of an engineering program. Using themes from the data, motivational profiles of students' future goals were characterized in terms of their possible selves and FTP. Results presented here describe FTPs with goals defined far into the future and the interactions of these goals with present tasks such as problem solving. This research furthers the understanding of the connection between multiple levels of student motivation and how these levels influence students' actions and performance.

S	McCave, Erin J.; Gilmore, Jordon; Burg, Karen			ASEE					Engineering and Science Student Preparedness for Research: Exploring the Connections Between Student Identity and Readiness for Research								2014 ASEE ANNUAL CONFERENCE		ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition												2014	2014	It has been suggested that engineering research is advanced by an increasingly diverse population of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) researchers with interdisciplinary research objectives. To develop a diverse population of STEM researchers, we must understand how their identities influence their feelings of preparedness for research experiences. The purpose of this study was to understand how a student's perception of preparedness is influenced by the student's science and engineering identity and his/her participation in interdisciplinary research. Underrepresented minority science and engineering undergraduate students participated in a National Science Foundation: Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation - Research Experience and Mentoring (REM) program for 1 semester. At the end of this research experience, students (n=10) were given an identity "pre-survey". A follow-up identity "post-survey" was given the first week of fall semester following various summer activities in which students participated. Domain-specific interest survey items revealed significant differences between science and engineering majors when the topic was engineering, for both pre-survey and post-survey responses. Results also indicate that both engineering and science majors are relatively confident in their level of preparedness for future research, signified by means above 6.0 for nearly every preparedness item. Before the summer experience, science students perceived significantly higher (p = 0.0039) recognition from their mentor(s) as compared to engineering students, whereas in every other aspect of science identity there were no significant differences by major in either pre- or post-summer experience items. The results suggest that early-stage engineering students identify less with research compared to their science counterparts and, subsequently, feel less prepared to conduct research; however, participation in an interdisciplinary experience increases their indication of academic research preparedness. The results show for, the population studied, that participation in a research program, such as REM and summer Research Experiences for Undergraduates, increases minority students' research identity, which may assist in increasing diversity of the STEM research population.

Commonly, the knowledge flow offered to engineering students is based on a step-by-step process taught by faculty using textbooks. Real-world problems often necessitate solutions that are not obtainable from traditional textbooks, such as ideation and selection of meaningful solutions, learning to deal with trade-offs, balancing competing properties, collaborating and communicating with colleagues whose perspectives are shaped by different backgrounds, in addition to the ability to visualize solutions. This paper discusses the implementation of Project-Based Learning (PBL) within the curriculum of the automotive engineering department at Clemson University in collaboration with the transportation design department at Art Center College of Design (ACCD).The program, called Deep Orange, is focused on developing and producing innovative new vehicle concepts and is driven entirely by graduate automotive engineering and transportation design students as part of their education in collaboration with industry partners. The paper discusses and demonstrates the methodology followed to translate PBL components within the educational context as well as the process the students need to follow. During this process, the students start with translating the grand challenge (defined by the sponsoring industry partners) into consumer needs and wants incorporating market and trend analyses. The project proceeds with general explorations, investigation of various design and vehicle architecture alternatives including selection of one concept based on carefully balancing environmental, economic, and social aspects. During this process, the faculty serves as mentors rather than knowledge dispensers. The students are empowered to make decisions and justify their concept selection to different groups, i.e. faculty members and industrial partners. The last eight months of each project comprises of building a physical prototype and validation of target achievement. Extensive marketing of the project outcomes at trade-shows with graduates involved concludes each project.

This study demonstrates the value of these three activities by quantifying participants' perceptions on how involvement in these organizations aid the development of traits named in the National Academy of Engineering's Engineer of 2020 report. Statistical analysis of data from over 250 student and alumni participants, from across the US, reveal that participants perceive each organization to make a statistically significant contribution to the development of at least one Engineer of 2020 trait. Results of this study provide leaders and advisors of these programs and organizations with empirical data that can be used to advocate for funding and institutional support.

Considering the phenomenon of asymmetric influences between neighboring users and different sensitivities of users to influences, we propose to select the users in the minimal weighted positive influence dominating set of a social network graph as the influential users to maximize the speed of the propagation. We present the first polynomial time self-stabilizing algorithm for minimal weighted positive influence dominating set in an arbitrary social network. Starting from an arbitrary initial state, the algorithm terminates in O(n(3)) steps using a distributed scheduler, where n is the number of nodes in the graph.

While the service can be used to relay a multitude of video content, its initial objective is to support live video streaming of educational content such as lectures and seminars among university campuses. Users on any campus would bootstrap video upload or download via a public web portal and, for scalability, have the video delivered seamlessly across the network over one or multiple paths selected and dynamically controlled by GC. The architecture aims to provide a framework for addressing several well-known limitations of video streaming in today's Internet, where little control is available for controlling forwarding paths of on-demand live video streams. GC utilizes GENI's distributed cloud servers to host on-demand video servers/relays and its OpenFlow SDN to achieve seamless video upload/download and optimization of forwarding paths in the network core. This paper presents the architecture and an early prototype of the basic GC framework, together with some initial performance measurement results.					22nd IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP)22nd IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP)	OCT 21-24, 2014OCT 21-24, 2014	IEEE; IEEE Comp Soc; Univ N Carolina; N Carolina State UnivIEEE; IEEE Comp Soc; Univ N Carolina; N Carolina State Univ	Raleigh, NCRaleigh, NC	1	0	0	0	0	1			1092-1648		978-1-4799-6204-4	WOS:000392944400062

We evaluate the system's ability to learning with two datasets, one synthetic and the other from writing samples gathered from human subjects. With both datasets, the respective test and training sets are the same so as to permit the process of interactive learning to be observed as it occurs. At it's core, this learning approach transforms sensory input and actuator output into rank P = 1 spaces, and uses learn a probabilistic mapping between these two "states" to perform the target task. In the future P > 1 will be used internally, and we conclude this work with a brief treatment on why we believe this to be a useful trajectory.					4th IEEE Annual International Conference on Cyber Technology in Automation, Control, and Intelligent Systems (CYBER)4th IEEE Annual International Conference on Cyber Technology in Automation, Control, and Intelligent Systems (CYBER)	JUN 04-07, 2014JUN 04-07, 2014	IEEEIEEE	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINAHong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0			2379-7711		978-1-4799-3669-4	WOS:000366574900007

Previously it was assumed that delays in network communication would inhibit control systems from leveraging networked resources such as remote compute power. Now, industrial and residential applications of the Internet of Things force us to revisit principled deployment and support of distributed sensing and actuation. Web standards provide key resources in the development and support of flexible distributed systems, however the conventional wisdom is that their use adds to the network delay and uncertainty, and makes a difficult control problem intractable. We quantify the effect of an important set of web standards (both formal and informal) in the control of physical systems. The results reported in this paper indicate that although the use of web standards provides an effective path to flexible implementation of distributed control, there are software design choices that impact the observed performance in significant ways.					4th IEEE Annual International Conference on Cyber Technology in Automation, Control, and Intelligent Systems (CYBER)4th IEEE Annual International Conference on Cyber Technology in Automation, Control, and Intelligent Systems (CYBER)	JUN 04-07, 2014JUN 04-07, 2014	IEEEIEEE	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINAHong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0			2379-7711		978-1-4799-3669-4	WOS:000366574900018

In this qualitative study we explore the unique aspects of their motivation for studying engineering, prior experiences, and impact of family life on these students. We find that job opportunities were the primary motivation for most of the students to pursue an engineering degree and prior work experience in the field was a factor in major selection for many who chose electrical or mechanical. Proximity and cost were primary reasons for choosing the transfer pathway and the sending and receiving institutions, although reputation was more often cited as the reason to choose the receiving institution. Students with families received significant motivation and support from them, but also faced unique challenges, including commuting or living apart. These factors limited their ability to integrate into campus life and develop a support network with other students. These students cited a number of advantages of returning to school after years away, among them a laser focus on their goals, practical technical experience that their younger classmates lack, and general maturity.

Our study adds to this literature with its focus on understanding the broader context of transfer pathways and the relative timing of the decisions to transfer and to major in engineering. Our goal is to identify the entry points into the transfer pathways and how the decision to transfer interacts with the decision to major in engineering. We focus on student intentions and the alterations to their planned pathways. To achieve our goal we analyzed 47 in-depth interviews of traditional-age engineering transfer students from three research universities. The results reveal four distinct transfer pathways characterized by different levels of intentionality and diverse decision making sequences. The findings have important implications for broadening the transfer pathway into engineering.

Currently, public data repositories, such as Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), have accumulated large amounts of microarray data. Efficient integrative analysis of those microarray data will provide significant knowledge about biological systems. None of the existing microarray preprocessing and quality assessment tools can handle very large microarray datasets with tens of thousands of experiments. The preprocessing and quality assessment of microarray datasets contain both data-intensive and compute-intensive tasks. In this paper, we develop a new set of tools using a mix of the Hadoop (for data intensive tasks) and the General-Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs) (for compute intensive tasks) to efficiently process large microarray data. Evaluation of our new tools on large microarray datasets with ten thousands of experiments showed promising superior performance. We demonstrate that the combination of Hadoop and GPGPU computation is effective for complex scientific applications that contain both data-intensive and compute-intensive tasks. Our new tool set will make it possible to utilize valuable large microarray data in the public repositories.

There are fundamental gaps in the construction of GRN with regard to modeling of hidden/ delayed interactions. Addressing these deficiencies is critical to understanding complex intracellular processes and enabling full use of the vast and ever-growing amount of available genomic data. Current modeling strategies either ignore or oversimplify time delays resulted from transcription and translation processes during gene expression. In addition, many research works do not account hidden variables such as transcription factors, repressors, small metabolites, DNA, microRNA species that regulate themselves and other genes but are not readily detectable on microarray experiments. To capture the effect of these parameters, in this paper, we utilize our developed Partially Connected Artificial Neural Networks with Evolvable Topology (PANNET) to find a more comprehensive model of GRN by considering the effects of unknown hidden variables and different time delays. This method is innovative, since the structure of the network has memory and internal states, which can model the unknown hidden variables and time delays. We furthermore use a new evolutionary optimization based on variable-length Genetic Algorithm (GA) to find a sparse structure of PANNET to predict the gene expression levels accurately. Finally we demonstrate the capability of PANNET in constructing GRN, including the effect of different delays and unknown hidden variables through modeling of E. coli SOS inducible DNA repair system.					14th IEEE International Conference on BioInformatics and BioEngineering (BIBE)14th IEEE International Conference on BioInformatics and BioEngineering (BIBE)	NOV 10-12, 2014NOV 10-12, 2014	IEEE; IEEE Comp Soc; Biol and Artificial Intelligence Soc; Florida Atlantic Univ; ABI Fdn; Modernizing Med; LexisNexisIEEE; IEEE Comp Soc; Biol and Artificial Intelligence Soc; Florida Atlantic Univ; ABI Fdn; Modernizing Med; LexisNexis	Boca Raton, FLBoca Raton, FL	1	0	0	1	0	1			2471-7819		978-1-4799-7502-0	WOS:000380460200004		
J	Bodde, David L.; Taiber, Joachim G.			IEEE					Entrepreneurship for Urban Mobility Systems								2014 IEEE INTERNATIONAL ELECTRIC VEHICLE CONFERENCE (IEVC)														2014	2014	The challenge to urban mobility arises from several intersecting trends: rapidly increasing urban populations; inadequate to non-existent infrastructure; ageing populations seeking to retain independent mobility, chiefly in the developed countries; and youthful populations seeking access to jobs, chiefly in the developing world. The consequences include: inferior service; wasted time from traffic congestion; pollution concentrated among dense populations, and inadequate vehicle parking. These challenges cannot be met by relying upon incremental improvements to the technologies and systems currently in place. Instead, radical entrepreneurial innovation must be allowed to offer disruptive improvements to the current mobility systems. However, singular innovations alone cannot unlock the full power of advanced technologies. In addition, large-scale, timely innovation will require ecosystem platforms to compete effectively with the incumbent business models and technologies. The most effective innovation ecosystems will find ways to include entrepreneurs in a predictable, systematic manner. Several kinds of kind of institutions can play a constructive role: governments at all levels to remove policy risk from the more customary risks to innovation; research universities through their teaching of innovation; entrepreneur support organizations; and, venture forums that connect startup companies to industry incumbents.					2014 IEEE International Electric Vehicle Conference (IEVC)2014 IEEE International Electric Vehicle Conference (IEVC)	DEC 17-19, 2014DEC 17-19, 2014		Florence, ITALYFlorence, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4799-6075-0	WOS:000380394300028

An experimentally validated model of a battery developed by All Cell Technologies, specific for light electric vehicles (electric scooter or bicycles) is used. Two state of charge estimation algorithms are developed: an extended Kalman filter and an adaptive extended Kalman filter. The adaptive version of Kalman filter is designed in order to adaptively set a proper value of the model noise covariance, using the information coming from the on-line innovation analysis. A comparison between the two approaches is conducted that shows that the adaptive Kalman filter can deal with the problem of incorrect value of the model noise covariance matrix producing lower estimation error.					2014 IEEE International Electric Vehicle Conference (IEVC)2014 IEEE International Electric Vehicle Conference (IEVC)	DEC 17-19, 2014DEC 17-19, 2014		Florence, ITALYFlorence, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4799-6075-0	WOS:000380394300052

Densification and optical transparency of the ceramic were achieved by means of sequential steps of cold isostatic pressing at 206 MPa, vacuum sintering using the two-step method at 1500 degrees C for a brief moment and at 1400 degrees C for 20 hrs, and hot isostatic pressing at 1300 degrees C for 6 hrs under 206 MPa of argon. After polishing to optical grade, samples were thermally processed at 1050 degrees C in 02 flux for a total of 10 hrs. Thermal processing was interrupted at specific times and photoluminescence and thermoluminescence were characterized. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR FTIR) measurements were also carried out and revealed the microstructural modifications induced by the thermal processing. Results reveal significant enhancement of luminescence concomitant to a strong decrease of the integral thermoluminescence intensity within the first hour of thermal processing, followed by stabilization.

While the calcined LuAG:Pr powder showed maximum luminescence emission for Pr concentrations between 0.18 and 0.33 at.%, maximum emission of ceramic bodies sintered at 1500 degrees C for 20 hrs. was for Pr concentrations between 0.018 and 0.18 at.%. Further, for short sintering times up to about 3 hrs. luminescence is maximum for Pr concentration around 0.33 at.%. Longer sintering times lead to the formation of PrAlO3 as a secondary phase, concomitant with a reduction of the intensity of luminescence emission.

Because these devices are vulnerable to theft, security of this data is put at higher risk once the attacker is in physical possession of the device, recovering these credentials and impersonating the owner of the phone is hard to defend by purely local means. We introduce the concept of 'notarization', a process by which a remote notary verifies the identity of the device user through video chat. We describe the design and implementation of a system that leverages notarization to protect cryptographic keys that the device uses to decrypt device data (e.g., website passwords) or perform signatures in support of client-side TLS, without trusting the notary with these keys. Through a lab-based study with 56 participants, we show that notarization even by strangers is effective for combating device theft.					10th IEEE International Conference on Collaborative Computing Networking Applications and Worksharing10th IEEE International Conference on Collaborative Computing Networking Applications and Worksharing	OCT 22-25, 2014OCT 22-25, 2014		Miami, FLMiami, FL	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-63190-043-3	WOS:000380476700002

Understanding the tradeoffs between information systems security and operational performance when applying maneuver principles is of interest to administrators, users, and researchers.

The MSTID is frequent in summer nighttime over Japan, showing wave structures with wavelengths of 100-200 km, periodicity of about 1 hour, and propagation toward the southwest. The phenomena are observed by the total electron content (TEC) from GEONET, Japanese dense network of GPS receivers, and 630 nm airglow imagers as horizontal pattern. It was also measured as Spread-F events of ionograms or as field-aligned echoes of the MU radar. MSTID was, in the past, explained by Perkins instability while its low growth rate was a problem [1]. Recently 3D simulation study by Yokoyama et al. [2] hypothesized a generation mechanism of the MSTID, which stands on electromagnetic E/F-region coupling of the ionosphere. The hypothesis is that the MSTID first grows with polarization electric fields from sporadic-E, then show spatial structures resembling to the Perkins instability. We recently conducted an observation campaign to check this hypothesis. We launched JASA ISAS sounding rockets S-310-42 and S-520-27 at 23:00 JST and 23:57JST on July 20, 2013 while an MSTID event was monitored in real-time by the GPS-TEC from GEONET. We found 1-5mV/m northeastward/eastward electric fields during the flight. Variation of electric fileds was associated with horizontal distribution of plasma density. Wind velocity was measured by the TME and Lithium releases from S-310-42 and S-520-27 rockets, respectively, showing southward wind near the sporadic-E layer heights. These results are consistent to the expected generation mechanism shown above. In the presentation we will discuss electric-field results and its relationship with plasma density variability together with preliminary results from the neutral-wind observations.					29th URSI General Assembly and Scientific Symposium (URSI GASS)29th URSI General Assembly and Scientific Symposium (URSI GASS)	AUG 16-23, 2014AUG 16-23, 2014	URSIURSI	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINABeijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4673-5225-3	WOS:000366628703104

Field evaluation and performance of capacitance probes for automated drip irrigation of watermelons								AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT				131				124	134		10.1016/j.agwat.2013.09.012			JAN 1 2014	2014	Continuous, real-time monitoring of soil-moisture is essential to effective and efficient water management in an automated drip irrigation system. The primary objectives of this 3-year (2008-2010) field study were to demonstrate the utility of multi-sensor capacitance probes (MCP) to automate high frequency drip irrigation in watermelons [Citrullus lanatus (Thumb.) Matsum. & Nak.] production and to determine irrigation set points as percent soil water content depletion. Irrigation water treatments of 15% available water depletion (AWD), 50% AWD and No water application (fertigation only) were tested in sandy Coastal Plain soils in South Carolina. Multi-sensor capacitance probes (MCPs) monitored soil water status in the top 50 cm profile and automatically triggered short (30-60 min) duration irrigation water cycles whenever the average 0-30 cm profile soil water content reached the irrigation set points. During peak crop water use and on hot days, four to seven irrigation events per day were necessary to meet crop water needs and minimize leaching in the sandy fields. The tactical irrigation scheduling capability offered via MCPs in an automated mode was highly advantageous. The short but frequent irrigation water cycles reduced water movement below the root zone (0-30 cm). The 15% AWD irrigation water treatment showed a significant yield increase of 44% and 18.4% during 2008 and 45% and 40% during 2010 compared to No Water Application and 50% AWD irrigation water treatments respectively. The MCP factory calibration was as good as on-site calibration and was sufficiently accurate for irrigation scheduling.

Exposure to ergot alkaloids during gestation reduces fetal growth in sheep								FRONTIERS IN CHEMISTRY				2						UNSP 68	10.3389/fchem.2014.00068			2014	2014	Tall fescue [Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.) Darbysh; Schedonorus phoenix (Scop.) Holub] is the primary cool season perennial grass in the eastern U.S. Most tall fescue contains an endophyte (Neotyphodium coenophialum), which produces ergot alkaloids that cause vasoconstriction and could restrict blood flow to the fetus in pregnant animals. The objective of this study was to examine fetal growth during maternal exposure to ergot alkaloids during gestation. Pregnant ewes (n = 16) were randomly assigned to one of two dietary treatments: (1) endophyte-infected (N. coenophialum) tall fescue seed (E+; 0.8 ug of ergovaline /g diet DM) and (2) endophyte-free tall fescue seed (E-; 0.0 ug of ergovaline/g diet DM). Birth weight of lambs was reduced by 37% for E+ compared to E-. Organ and muscle weights were also lighter for E+ than E-. Exposure to ergot alkaloids in utero reduces fetal growth and muscle development.									3	0	0	1	0	3				2296-2646		WOS:000209678600071	25191653

An expert panel provided insights in developing culturally appropriate intervention strategies.Results: Child and parent focus group analysis revealed 11 barriers and no definitive facilitators for healthy eating and lifestyles. Parents reported confusion regarding what constitutes nutritional eating, varying needs of family members in terms of issues with weight, and difficulty in engaging the family in appropriate and safe physical activities; to name a few themes. Community experts independently suggested that nutritional information is confusing and, often, contradictory. Additionally, they recommended simple messaging and practical interventions such as helping with shopping lists, meal planning, and identifying simple and inexpensive physical activities.Conclusion: Childhood obesity in the context of low-resource families is a complex problem with no simple solutions. Culturally sensitive and family informed interventions are needed to support low-income African American families in dealing with childhood obesity.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2296-2360			WOS:000209897200135	25538931

The reduced stacked multicell converter is the most advanced one with less number of power switches and flying capacitors leading to a reduced size and cost. This paper proposes a reduced stacked multicell converter based STATCOM to control the amount of injected/absorbed reactive power to/from the utility grid. The analytic model of the STATCOM is provided to systematically design a controller. Moreover, an active voltage balancing method is proposed to regulate the flying capacitor voltages of the reduced stacked multicell converter controlled with level-shifted-carrier PWM. The circuit is simulated for different case studies and obtained simulation results are provided to show the performance of the proposed STATCOM, active voltage balancing scheme for flying capacitor voltages, and also its control system.					40th Annual Conference of the IEEE-Industrial-Electronics-Society (IECON)40th Annual Conference of the IEEE-Industrial-Electronics-Society (IECON)	OCT 29-NOV 01, 2014OCT 29-NOV 01, 2014	Inst Elect & Elect Engineers; IEEE Ind Elect SocInst Elect & Elect Engineers; IEEE Ind Elect Soc	Dallas, TXDallas, TX	0	0	0	0	0	0			1553-572X		978-1-4799-4032-5	WOS:000389471601016

A Hybrid Stochastic-Deterministic Approach For Active Fault Diagnosis Using Scenario Optimization								IFAC PAPERSONLINE				47	3			1102	1107					2014	2014	Active fault diagnosis can improve the diagnosability of potential faults by injecting a suitable input into the system. This input can be designed using either a stochastic or a deterministic framework. The stochastic approach aims to maximize the probability of a correct diagnosis at a certain time, whereas the deterministic approach aims to guarantee diagnosis within a certain time interval. Recently, a hybrid stochastic -deterministic approach has been developed in which all uncertainties are described by uniform probability density functions (PDFs) with finite support on zonotopes. This method is able to provide a guaranteed diagnosis at a given time N, while approximately maximizing the probability of diagnosis at some earlier time M < N. In this article, the hybrid stochastic -deterministic method is extended to arbitrary PDFs using a sampling approach based on scenario optimization.					19th World Congress of the International-Federation-of-Automatic-Control (IFAC)19th World Congress of the International-Federation-of-Automatic-Control (IFAC)	AUG 24-29, 2014AUG 24-29, 2014	Int Federat Automat ControlInt Federat Automat Control	Cape Town, SOUTH AFRICACape Town, SOUTH AFRICA	0	0	0	0	0	0			2405-8963			WOS:000391107100179

Computational Approaches for Bad Data Handling in Power System Synchrophasor Networks								IFAC PAPERSONLINE				47	3			11269	11274					2014	2014	The state estimators used in real-time power system control centers now process bad data as a standard routine. With the introduction and deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs), it is possible to model power systems, even with their time-varying nature, in real-time. However, PMUs remain vulnerable to providing bad data for several reasons. In this paper, a new intelligent framework, the cellular computational network (CCN), is introduced for the decentralized predictive modeling and dynamic state estimation (DSE) of a power system with PMU data. The CCN-based DSE is resilient to interactions between multiple segments of bad data from one or more PMUs.					19th World Congress of the International-Federation-of-Automatic-Control (IFAC)19th World Congress of the International-Federation-of-Automatic-Control (IFAC)	AUG 24-29, 2014AUG 24-29, 2014	Int Federat Automat ControlInt Federat Automat Control	Cape Town, SOUTH AFRICACape Town, SOUTH AFRICA	0	0	0	0	0	0			2405-8963			WOS:000391109200375

The synthesis and NMR data of its corresponding precursors, its sulfur adduct and dimer are reported. Complexes of type [MCl(COD)(1)] and [MCl(CO)(2)(1)] (M = Rh and Ir, 1 = 1,3-dibutyldibenzo[a, c]phenazino[11,12-d]imidazol-2-ylidene) were prepared and characterized using spectroscopic and crystallographic methods. The electron-releasing capacity of this new carbene was investigated by evaluation of its corresponding IrCl(COD) and IrCl(CO)(2) complexes by IR spectroscopy (nu(av)) and cyclic voltammetry (E-1/2). These studies revealed that the electron donicity of this ligand is comparable to that of the previously reported naphthoquinone-annulated imidazolin-2-ylidene. Some preliminary studies of the photophysical properties and catalytic activity of these metal complexes are reported. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

The compositions and filling fractions were confirmed with a combination of Rietveld refinement and elemental analysis. Their thermoelectric properties were evaluated from 300 to 800 K. The Seebeck coefficients for the specimens increase with increasing temperature and plateau at around 750 K. The thermal conductivity decreases with increasing Yb filling fraction, and bipolar conduction becomes evident and increases at elevated temperatures. A maximum ZT value of 0.8 was obtained at 750 K for Yb0.47Co2.6Fe1.4Sb12. The thermoelectric properties and potential for further optimization are discussed in light of our results.

J	Campbell, Brandon; Petukh, Marharyta; Alexov, Emil; Li, Chuan								On the electrostatic properties of homodimeric proteins.								Journal of theoretical & computational chemistry				13	3									2014	2014	A large fraction of proteins function as homodimers, but it is not always clear why the dimerization is important for functionality since frequently each monomer possesses a distinctive active site. Recent work (PLoS Computational Biology, 9(2), e1002924) indicates that homodimerization may be important for forming an electrostatic funnel in the spermine synthase homodimer which guides changed substrates toward the active centers. This prompted us to investigate the electrostatic properties of a large set of homodimeric proteins and resulted in an observation that in a vast majority of the cases the dimerization indeed results in specific electrostatic features, although not necessarily in an electrostatic funnel. It is demonstrated that the electrostatic dipole moment of the dimer is predominantly perpendicular to the axis connecting the centers of the mass of the monomers. In addition, the surface points with highest potential are located in the proximity of the interfacial plane of the homodimeric complexes. These findings indicate that frequently homodimerization provides specific electrostatic features needed for the function of proteins.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0219-6336			MEDLINE:25419028	25419028

Surgery groups are forced to release unscheduled OR time, which then becomes available for other groups to use. In this paper, we investigate release policies based on various surgery arrival distributions, capacity levels, and case durations. We show the tradeoffs of different policies involving assigned block and open posting rooms' utilization levels and number of cases not accommodated in the schedule. Our results show that block release has a minor benefit for services with high room utilization (at or above 80%). Services with lower room utilizations may benefit from release, but one must consider whether to use block release or to reallocate the service's block time.

The decision to make a schedule adjustment will impact patient safety, patient satisfaction, hospital costs, as well as surgeon satisfaction. Of particular importance is when, and how frequently, to update the scheduling and tracking systems. These questions and their impact on maintaining schedule accuracy and minimizing room overtime are explored. Discrete event simulation was used to simulate surgical cases in the OR and to test different "right shifting" and case updating policies for their effectiveness. Results and staff experience indicate that ten minutes is the preferred delay in which an update should be made; otherwise staff satisfaction or schedule accuracy will suffer.

Non-elective surgeries count for a considerable proportion of surgery demand and often have a priority for begin served in a timely manner. Accommodating this type of surgery can be a challenging task on the day of surgery. This is mainly a result of the uncertain demand for non-elective surgeries, which discourages hospitals from reserving sufficient capacity for these surgeries. Using simulation, we evaluate an optimal policy for accommodating elective and non-elective surgeries that minimizes waiting time of patients, overtime, and number of patients turned away. We carry out the analysis on a stylized, two-room study where one room is dedicated to non-elective cases and the other room contains elective cases but can accept a non-elective case if necessary. The optimal policy is originally found by using a Markov decision process (MDP). However, since Markov modeling has an exponential arrival rate and steady state assumptions, which may not always be true in a surgical environment, the evaluation through simulation allows these assumptions to be relaxed.

ASME					DEVELOPMENT OF A DESIGN FOR MANUFACTURING RULES DATABASE FOR USE IN INSTRUCTION OF DFM PRACTICES								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, 2014, VOL 1A										V01AT02A054				2014	2014	In recent years, there has been a significant push towards "Design for X" (DFX) in modern engineering design practice. One such category that has received a large amount of attention is design for manufacturing. When conducting design for manufacturing, a common tool to assist in the design process is design for a series of design for manufacturing guidelines. While the use of these guidelines, as well as other DFX guidelines, has been shown to be effective, little research has been done with the intent to standardize the guidelines or make them more readily available. In this paper, the authors propose a Design for Manufacturing database tool to assist in the instruction of design for manufacturing guidelines. The development of the database model is discussed, as well as the interface that is used to interact with the database. The tool is then evaluated and conclusions are made with regards to the effectiveness of the database and any future work to increase the functionality.

The knowledge representation is used to drive a decision support system that provides the user with intelligent MTM table suggestions based on assembly work instructions. Inference rules are used to map work instructions to MTM tables. An explicit defmition of the assembly time estimation domain is required. The contribution of this research, in addition to the decision support system, is an extensible knowledge representation that models work instructions, MTM tables and mapping rules between the two which will enable the establishment of assembly time estimates. Further, the ontology provides an extensible knowledge representation framework for linking time studies and assembly processes.

Designers and researchers at Clemson University worked on a research projects with Michelin to support NIST efforts in fuel efficiency improvement and NASA efforts in manned exploration systems. The goal of each was to replace the elastomeric material of shear band with materials which can tolerate harsh temperatures and shear loads or to replace the materials with linear elastic low-hysteretic loss materials. The concepts initially proposed by ideation method were prototyped for physical testing. A case study examining the documentation reports for each project is conducted to provide a reflective understanding of how the evolution in the projects occurred. The goal of developing this retrospective is to try to identify guidelines and approaches that could be integrated into a designer driven systematic approach for custom design of meso-structures.

New FGM research makes design, manufacturing, and use of FGM objects a promising alternative to homogeneous objects or composites with one direction of gradation. Heterogeneous anisotropic artifacts can be manufactured with specific 3D printing processes and potentially bring significant increases in functionalities. However, many challenges exist while designing and manufacturing these objects. This paper explores these challenges and suggests needed research. In particular the ability to model FGM objects, setup and run optimization algorithms, create manufacturing process plans, and control the manufacturing process all need more research and better software tools. In addition, researchers must rigorously test optimally designed FGM objects in order to validate the FGM object properties and the FGM design process before adoption of FGM objects by industry is likely to occur.

ASME					SOLVING STRUCTURE FOR NETWORK-DECOMPOSED PROBLEMS OPTIMIZED WITH AUGMENTED LAGRANGIAN COORDINATION								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, 2014, VOL 2B										V02BT03A033				2014	2014	The complexity of design and optimization tasks of modern products which cannot be carried out by a single expert or by a single design team motivated the development of the field of decomposition-based optimization. In general, the process of decomposition-based optimization consists of two procedures: (1) Partitioning the original problem into sub-problems according to the design disciplines, components or other aspects; and (2) Coordinating these sub-problems to guarantee that the aggregation of their optimal solutions results in a feasible and optimal solution for the original problem. Much current work focuses on alternative approaches for these two procedures.For a decomposed problem with a hierarchical structure, the above two procedures work very well and the Analytical Target Cascading method tailored for this type of problems can be used as the coordination method. However, for a more generally decomposed problem with a non-hierarchical structure, there are several factors that might affect the performance of the optimization by decomposition besides the traditional two procedures. In this paper, these factors are identified as: (1) the number of Lagrangian multipliers; (2) the number of decomposition levels (3) the existence and the selection of the master sub-problem. These factors further characterize the structure to solve the decomposed problem: the Solving Structure for decomposition-based optimization. Both mathematical and engineering test problems are used to explore the role of the solving structure. The results show that under the same partition and using the same coordination method, the Augmented Lagrangian Coordination, the performance of the decomposition-based optimization may be largely different in terms of efficiency, accuracy and resource cost. The results highlight the importance of choosing an optimal solving structure after deciding on the procedures of partitioning and coordination. Based on these test results, several suggestions for guidelines on the selection of an optimal solving structure selection are proposed.

ASME					DUAL RESIDUAL IN AUGMENTED LAGRANGIAN COORDINATION FOR DECOMPOSITION-BASED OPTIMIZATION								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, 2014, VOL 2B										V02BT03A032				2014	2014	As system design problems increase in complexity, researchers seek approaches to optimize such problems by coordinating the optimizations of decomposed sub-problems. Many methods for optimization by decomposition have been proposed in the literature among which, the Augmented Lagrangian Coordination (ALC) method has drawn much attention due to its efficiency and flexibility. The ALC method involves a quadratic penalty term, and the initial setting and update strategy of the penalty weight are critical to the performance of the ALC. The weight in the traditional weight update strategy always increases and previous research shows that an inappropriate initial value of the penalty weight may cause the method not to converge to optimal solutions.Inspired by the research on Augmented Lagrangian Relaxation in the convex optimization area, a new weight update strategy in which the weight can either increase or decrease is introduced into engineering optimization. The derivation of the primal and dual residuals for optimization by decomposition is conducted as a first step. It shows that the traditional weight update strategy only considers the primal residual, which may result in a duality gap and cause a relatively big solution error. A new weight update strategy considering both the primal and dual residuals is developed which drives the dual residual to zero in the optimization process, thus guaranteeing the solution accuracy of the decomposed problem. Finally, the developed strategy is applied to both mathematical and engineering test problems and the results show significant improvements in solution accuracy. Additionally, the proposed approach makes the ALC method more robust since it allows the coordination to converge with an initial weight selected from a much wider range of possible values while the selection of initial weight is a big concern in the traditional weight update strategy.

Much of the project time is spent eliciting the requirements. However, it is observed that students primarily only consider requirements while evaluating the concepts. This paper presents a case study conducted with senior mechanical engineering design students in a capstone course to begin to understand requirement evolution throughout a project. Data in the form of weekly requirements was collected from four teams working in parallel on the same industry sponsored project. The paper introduces the concepts of completeness and specificity that could allow the use of requirements as a tool for measuring project health. The findings from the case study reveal that the completeness and specificity of requirements increase from initial week to final week.

This paper outlines a HIL platform for a series hybrid powertrain and discusses particular control strategies. The main hardware components of the platform are a gasoline generator, a lead acid battery pack, a bi-directional dc/dc converter, a programmable dc load, strain gauges, and a rotary encoder. Along with these hardware components, a real-time control prototyping system is used to implement energy management strategies and monitor several signals form the HIL platform. The effectiveness and performance of this platform is demonstrated by implementing two versions of the Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS). The first version uses a constant equivalence factor for weighting the cost of electrical energy storage, while the second version uses an adaptive equivalence factor based on the deviation of battery state of charge (SOC) from a reference SOC.

The system consists of a suspended sand-filled trough that rotates when driven by the prototype. Sensors are used to determine traction slippage of prototypes, providing a quantitative measure of relative prototype performance. This paper describes system improvements to better simulate extraterrestrial environments and more accurately measure prototype performance. A tire prototype hard stop was designed and built to prevent damage associated with the tire assembly resting in the trough. A rock obstacle was created to simulate rough terrain. A sensor system was designed to more accurately determine tire velocity. Various concepts were developed and prototyped to groom the sand during testing. Computational hardware and software upgrades were made to better facilitate the data acquisition processes. An instructional video was created to explain operational procedures. The sensor system will be integrated with the software and a sand grooming concept will be implemented.

Saturation is explicitly defined and computed as the deficiency of a tire to generate a linearly increasing force in either the lateral or longitudinal direction. The optimal management of lateral saturation levels is set as the objective for an upper level controller, while the optimal management of longitudinal saturation among all tires is set as the objective for a lower level driving/braking torque distribution controller. This cascaded predictive scheme exploits prevailing time scale separations between the lateral vehicle dynamics and the tire/wheel dynamics. The performance of the approach is illustrated using simulations of a medium-duty truck undergoing a transient handling maneuver.

This becomes problematic when trying to efficiently create best practice templates for assembly processes because the procedure for linking these best practice assembly processes with vehicle components becomes a daunting task. This research is aimed at the development of a decision support system and cyber infrastructure for efficiently linking product information and process information.. Specifically, tools are developed to link product and process information in the automotive industry. The goal of this research is to develop and encode rules to guide the linking of product and process information. These rules are formed from historical data and provide suggestions to process planners as to which variants of parts can be assigned to the same standardized set of assembly instructions which exist as process sheet templates. The part data used consists of a standard text description of the part, the bounding box coordinates for all possible installation locations of the part, a unique identifier for the part, and a logic string which defines valid vehicle configurations such as platforms, models, and options for which the part is valid. A portion of this data is analyzed and used as the basis for development of the part grouping rules. Each rule will compare two parts with respect to the relevant part data and determine whether the two parts are capable of being assigned to the same process sheet. The development of the rules is discussed along with examples, followed with a discussion regarding the implementation of the rules into a prototype system. The rules are tested against part data not used in the development process, and a discussion of the results is presented. The paper concludes with conclusions drawn from testing of the rules and a discussion of future work.

This allows the manufacturer to take advantage of the high volumes found in mass production while still manufacturing products that fit the needs of individual customers. In order to effectively implement mass customization principles in production, the manufacturers must rely on some form of configuration management to keep track of the large amount of domain knowledge that is involved. The purpose of this paper is to present a review of existing configuration management practices and why they are necessary in today's economy. This includes a case study of the configuration management and configuration change practices of a major automotive OEM. Based on the results of the case study, the authors present a series of recommendations to increase the effectiveness of the OEM's change management practices.

To that end, an energy harvester consisting of a thin piezoelectric cantilever beam subjected to vibratory base excitation is considered. To permit galloping excitation, a bluff body is rigidly attached at the free end such that a net aerodynamic lift is generated as the incoming airflow separates on both sides of the body giving rise to limit cycle oscillations when the flow velocity exceeds a critical value. A nonlinear electromechanical distributed-parameter model of the harvester under the combined excitation is derived using the energy approach and by adopting the nonlinear Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, linear constitutive relations for the piezoelectric transduction, and the quasi-steady assumption for the aerodynamic loading. The partial differential equations of the system are discretized and a reduced-order-model is obtained. The mathematical model is validated by conducting a series of experiments with different loading conditions represented by wind speed, base excitation amplitude, and excitation frequency around the primary resonance.

ASME					INFLUENCE OF POTENTIAL FUNCTION ASYMMETRIES ON THE PERFORMANCE OF NONLINEAR ENERGY HARVESTERS UNDER WHITE NOISE								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL DESIGN ENGINEERING TECHNICAL CONFERENCES AND COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION IN ENGINEERING CONFERENCE, 2014, VOL 6										V006T10A060				2014	2014	To improve the broadband transduction capabilities of vibratory energy harvesters (VEHs) under random and non-stationary excitations, many researchers have resorted to purposefully introducing nonlinearities into the restoring force of the harvester. While performing this task, it is often very challenging to maintain a perfectly symmetric restoring force which usually yields a VEH with an asymmetric potential energy function. This paper investigates the influence of potential function asymmetries on the performance of nonlinear VEHs under white noise inputs. To that end, a quadratic nonlinearity is introduced into the restoring force of the harvester and its influence on the mean power for both mono- and bi-stable potentials is investigated. It is shown that, for VEHs with a mono-stable potential function, the mean output power increases with the degree of potential function asymmetry. On the other hand, for energy harvesters with a bi-stable potential function, asymmetries in the restoring force appear to worsen performance especially for low to moderate noise intensities. When the noise intensity becomes sufficiently large, the influence of the potential function's asymmetry on the mean power diminishes. Results also reveal that a VEH with a symmetric bi-stable potential function produces higher mean power levels than the one with the most asymmetric mono-stable potential. As such, it is concluded that a VEH with a bi-stable symmetric potential is most desirable to improve performance under white noise.

The goals of this work were 1) to develop a protocol for documenting human interactions with artifacts and 2) to use this protocol to investigate the use of prototypes during conceptual design. The protocol was used to document the actions of study participants in a manner that allowed searching for patterns of behavior. The most common patterns indicated that participants were learning or finding inspiration from the physical artifact interactions that were then applied to their design solutions. In addition, several opportunities for protocol and experimental methods improvements are presented.

The experiment conditions were (1) requirements elicitation (given only problem statement), (2) partial elicitation (given problem and five requirements) and (3) no elicitation (given problem and ten requirements). Participants in the first two conditions were challenged with eliciting requirements first. All participants were also asked to generate solutions. Comparing the requirements addressed in the solutions generated by the participants, it is found that the group that was not primed with the task of eliciting requirements performed better in terms of addressing requirements when compared to other two groups. These findings lead to the inference in conceptual design stage that allowing the students to elicit requirements does not have significant potential benefits while addressing the requirements.

A controlled group of students was given a burrito folder design problem with no requirements and asked to sketch solutions. Four experimental groups given different requirement treatments were also asked to sketch solutions for the same design problem. The experimental conditions were functional requirements, nonfunctional requirements, mixed prioritized requirements and randomly mixed requirements. Analysis of the experimental results reveals that there is a significant difference in quantity of means between the non-functional requirements and the functional requirements groups, with the non-functional group achieving higher quantity scores. In addition, there is a significant difference in quantity in functional requirements and no requirements with the no requirements group achieving higher quantity scores. In terms of quality, there are significant differences in means between the non-functional requirement and functional requirement groups as well as the non-functional and no requirements group. Therefore having non-functional requirements can positively impact the quantity (p-value = 0.09) and the quality of concepts solutions (p-value = 0.018). These findings lead to new future research questions related to understanding exactly how the functionality, in this case functional requirements, influence an engineer's thinking.

Based on experimental observations, they hypothesized that acoustic heating due to internal friction and energy activation at dislocations was responsible for this temporary weakening of the material. Later research studies investigating the acoustic softening process used different experimental setups leading to alternative theories of the softening process such as superposition of static and dynamic stress. The variation in the design of the experiments leads to significant differences in observations, causing differing interpretations of the results and the formation of competing theories. We reviewed previous experimental studies and found that the optimum setup is similar to Blaha's and Langenecker's. Their setup minimizes noise factors such as friction at the oscillator specimen interface, which could contribute to heating and stress reduction. Therefore, we present our experimental setup composed of an MTS tensile test machine and a Branson ultrasonic welder to study the softening of aluminum 6061 and discuss our own results and how they compare with those in the literature. Additionally, we investigate the applicability of competing theories of softening based on our experimental data.

STELLA NOVAE: PAST AND FUTURE DECADES		Astronomical Society of the Pacific Conference Series		490				91	94					2014	2014	It is often stated that novae trace light in their host galaxies. Using a combined bulge and disk model, we find that this "law" does not yield a good match to the observed positional distribution of novae in M31. We outline our modeling approach and present the results for a two component model in which the bulge to disk light ratio is an exact match to the photometrically determined brightness profile of M31.					4th International Conference on Classical and Recurrent Novae - Stella Novae: Past and Future Decades4th International Conference on Classical and Recurrent Novae - Stella Novae: Past and Future Decades	FEB 04-08, 2013FEB 04-08, 2013	Univ Cape Town; Natl Res Fdn; S African Astron Observ; Univ Cape Town, Astrophys Cosmol & Grav Ctr; Royal Astron Soc; Square Kilometre Array S Africa Project OffUniv Cape Town; Natl Res Fdn; S African Astron Observ; Univ Cape Town, Astrophys Cosmol & Grav Ctr; Royal Astron Soc; Square Kilometre Array S Africa Project Off	Pavilion Clock Tower, Cape Town, SOUTH AFRICAPavilion Clock Tower, Cape Town, SOUTH AFRICA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-58381-864-0	WOS:000368750100011

Ramawat, KG; Merillon, JM; Ahuja, MR		Biotechnology of Trees: Chestnut								TREE BIOTECHNOLOGY								3	35					2014	2014	Biotechnology has been practiced on chestnuts (Castanea spp.) for many decades, including vegetative propagation, controlled crossing followed by testing and selection, genetic and cytogenetic mapping, genetic modification, and gene and genome sequencing. Vegetative propagation methods have ranged from grafting and rooting to somatic embryogenesis, often in coordination with breeding efforts and programs. More recently, particularly in the United States, chestnut biotechnology has included the analysis of genes and genomes with the goal of characterizing and finding disease resistance genes and utilizing them for developing resistant Castanea dentata (American chestnut) for use in species conservation programs. In this chapter we review chestnut biotechnology, especially with respect to its development in the United States, with emphasis on producing resistant C. dentata using various resistant sources of C. mollissma (Chinese chestnut) and C. crenata (Japanese chestnut).									1	0	0	1	0	1					978-1-4665-9715-0; 978-1-4665-9714-3	WOS:000384332400002

J	Song, Wei-Li; Cao, Mao-Sheng; Lu, Ming-Ming; Bi, Song; Wang, Chan-Yuan; Liu, Jia; Yuan, Jie; Fan, Li-Zhen					Cao, Mao-Sheng/0000-0001-6810-9422			Flexible graphene/polymer composite films in sandwich structures for effective electromagnetic interference shielding								CARBON				66				67	76		10.1016/j.carbon.2013.08.043			JAN 2014	2014	Multilayer graphene/polymer composite films with good mechanical flexibility were fabricated into paraffin-based sandwich structures to evaluate electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding. Experimental results showed the relationship between electrical properties and shielding performance, demonstrating that electrical properties are significant factors in EMI shielding. Calculation based on electrical conductivity of the composite films was carried out to investigate the fundamental mechanisms of absorption, reflection and multiple-reflections for the polymeric graphene composite films. Both experimental and calculated results indicate that reflection is the dominating shielding mechanism for the as-fabricated polymeric graphene films. The optimization of thickness, skin depth and electrical conductivity in the shielding materials could be highly significant in achieving enhanced EMI shielding. Further improvement in absorption shielding has been achieved by increasing the shielding thickness in order to enhance the overall shielding performance. The optimized shielding effectiveness up to 27 dB suggested effective shielding of the composite films. The implication of the mechanisms for optimizing shielding performance demonstrates significant fundamental basis for designing high-performance EMI shielding composites. The results and techniques also promise a simple and effective approach to achieve light-weight graphene-based composite films for application potentials in EMI shielding coatings.

J	Yang, Jinyi; Li, Jing; Jiang, Yueming; Duan, Xuewu; Qu, Hongxia; Yang, Bao; Chen, Feng; Sivakumar, Dharini				Sivakumar, Dharini/C-6924-2014	Sivakumar, Dharini/0000-0001-7645-7857			Natural Occurrence, Analysis, and Prevention of Mycotoxins in Fruits and their Processed Products								CRITICAL REVIEWS IN FOOD SCIENCE AND NUTRITION				54	1			64	83		10.1080/10408398.2011.569860			JAN 1 2014	2014	Mycotoxins are small toxic chemical products formed as the secondary metabolites by fungi that readily contaminate foods with toxins in the field or after harvest. The presence of mycotoxins, such as aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, and patulin, in fruits and their processed products is of high concern for human health due to their properties to induce severe acute and chronic toxicity at low-dose levels. Currently, a broad range of detection techniques used for practical analysis and detection of a wide spectrum of mycotoxins are available. Many analytical methods have been developed for the determination of each group of these mycotoxins in different food matrices, but new methods are still required to achieve higher sensitivity and address other challenges that are posed by these mycotoxins. Effective technologies are needed to reduce or even eliminate the presence of the mycotoxins in fruits and their processed products. Preventive measures aimed at the inhibition of mycotoxin formation in fruits and their processed products are the most effective approach. Detoxification of mycotoxins by different physical, chemical, and biological methods are less effective and sometimes restricted because of concerns of safety, possible losses in nutritional quality of the treated commodities and cost implications. This article reviewed the available information on the major mycotoxins found in foods and feeds, with an emphasis of fruits and their processed products, and the analytical methods used for their determination. Based on the current knowledge, the major strategies to prevent or even eliminate the presence of the mycotoxins in fruits and their processed products were proposed.									7	1	0	7	0	7			1040-8398	1549-7852		WOS:000327927600004	24188233	
J	Manganiello, Felice; Trautmann, Anna-Lena								Spread decoding in extension fields								FINITE FIELDS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS				25				94	105		10.1016/j.ffa.2013.08.002			JAN 2014	2014	A spread code is a set of vector spaces of a fixed dimension over a finite field F-q with certain properties used for random network coding. It can be constructed in different ways which lead to different decoding algorithms. In this work we consider one such representation of spread codes and present a minimum distance decoding algorithm which is efficient when the code words, the received space and the error space have small dimension.

In this work, we adopted a melting-milling-hot pressing procedure to prepare nanocomposites that consist of a micrometer-grained Yb0.2Co4Sb12 matrix and well-dispersed AgSbTe2 nanoinclusions on the matrix grain boundaries. Different weight percentages of AgSbTe2 inclusions were added to optimize the thermoelectric performance. We found that the addition of AgSbTe2 nanoinclusions systematically and simultaneously optimized the otherwise adversely inter-dependent electrical conductivity, Seebeck coefficient and thermal conductivity. In particular, the significantly enhanced carrier mobility led to a similar to 3-fold reduction of the electrical resistivity. Meanwhile the absolute value of Seebeck coefficient was enhanced via the energy filtering effect at the matrix-nanoinclusion interfaces. Moreover there is a topological crossover of the AgSbTe2 inclusions from isolated nanoparticles to a nano-plating or nano-coating between 6 wt% and 8 wt% of nanoinclusions. Above the crossover, further addition of nanoinclusions degraded the Seebeck coefficient and the electrical conductivity. Meanwhile, the addition of nanoinclusions generally reduced the lattice thermal conductivity. As a result, the power factor of the 6 wt% sample was similar to 7 times larger than that of the nanoinclusion-free sample, yielding a room temperature figure of merit ZT similar to 0.51.									15	0	0	1	0	15			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000327618600008		
J	Bixler, Robert D.; Joseph, Stephanie L.; Searles, Vicki M.								Volunteers as Products of a Zoo Conservation Education Program								JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION				45	1			57	73		10.1080/00958964.2013.814618			JAN 1 2014	2014	Zoos embrace docents/volunteers as a means of interpreting the threats to wildlife and biodiversity to visitors. To accomplish this, zoos provide docents' education, training, and work experience. Docents themselves also engage in solitary and social wildlife experiences outside of their volunteer obligations. This study examined what motivates docents and how they change as part of their experience. Results from a mailback questionnaire (91% response rate, n = 365) documented that both altruistic (interpreting wildlife to visitors) and egoistic (learning about wildlife themselves; socializing with like-minded others) motivations were predictive of continuing satisfaction with their volunteer experiences. Docents also reported starting or increasing many conservation behaviors after beginning to volunteer at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo. Docents with more years of experience tended to report more involvement with conservation behaviors. Results support an environmental socialization framework to explain the impacts of an environmental training program. Implications for future research and practice are presented.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0095-8964	1940-1892		WOS:000326778600004

In this paper we consider the more general question of when the product of an eigenform with any modular form is again an eigenform. We prove that this can occur only in very special situations. We then relate the divisibility of eigenforms to linear independence of vectors of Rankin-Selberg L-values.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0002-9939	1088-6826		WOS:000326580100004

Human factors systems approach to healthcare quality and patient safety								APPLIED ERGONOMICS				45	1			14	25		10.1016/j.apergo.2013.04.023			JAN 2014	2014	Human factors systems approaches are critical for improving healthcare quality and patient safety. The SEIPS (Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety) model of work system and patient safety is a human factors systems approach that has been successfully applied in healthcare research and practice. Several research and practical applications of the SEIPS model are described. Important implications of the SEIPS model for healthcare system and process redesign are highlighted. Principles for redesigning healthcare systems using the SEIPS model are described. Balancing the work system and encouraging the active and adaptive role of workers are key principles for improving healthcare quality and patient safety.

The flat intensity distribution leads to an effective mode area of similar to 1880 mu m(2) in the straight fiber, an over 50% increase comparing to that of regular LCF with the same core diameter. The flat-top mode was achieved by using a uniform Yb-doped silica glass in the core center with an index of similar to 2x10(-4) lower than that of the silica background. The fiber was also tested in a laser configuration, demonstrating an optical-to-optical efficiency of similar to 77% at 1026 nm with respect to the pump at 975 nm.

However, phenotypic variation among individuals that might convey a selective advantage may occur across any of multiple levels of biological organization. In this study, we test for differences in external morphology, muscle mechanical advantage, muscle fiber type and protein expression among individuals of the waterfall climbing Hawaiian fish Sicyopterus stimpsoni collected from sequential pools increasing in elevation within a single freshwater stream. Despite predictions from previous laboratory studies of morphological selection, few directional morphometric changes in body shape were observed at successively higher elevations. Similarly, lever arm ratios associated with the main pelvic sucker, central to climbing ability in this species, did not differ between elevations. However, among climbing muscles, the adductor pelvicus complex (largely responsible for generating pelvic suction during climbing) contained a significantly greater red muscle fiber content at upstream sites. A proteomic analysis of the adductor pelvicus revealed two-fold increases in expression levels for two respiratory chain proteins (NADH: ubiquinone reductase and cytochrome b) that are essential for aerobic respiration among individuals from successively higher elevations. Assessed collectively, these evaluations reveal phenotypic differences at some, but not all levels of biological organization that are likely the result of selective pressures experienced during climbing.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1932-6203			WOS:000329117900114	24386424	
J	Barry, John N; Vertegel, Alexey A								NANOMATERIALS FOR PROTEIN MEDIATED THERAPY AND DELIVERY.								Nano LIFE				3	4									2013-Dec-27	2013	There has been a significant amount of research done on liposomes and nanoparticles as drug carriers for protein drugs. Proteins and enzymes have been used both as targeting moieties and for their therapeutic potential. High specificity and rapid reaction rates make proteins and enzymes excellent candidates for therapeutic treatment, but some limitations exist. Many of these limitations can be addressed by a well studied nanotechnology based delivery system. Such a system can provide a medium for delivery, stabilization of the drugs, and enable site specific accumulation of drugs. Nanomedicines such as these have great potential to revolutionize the pharmaceutical industry and improve healthcare worldwide.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1793-9844			MEDLINE:25414730	25414730

The direction of diastereoselectivity is solvent dependent for alkyl Grignard reagents reacting with epoxy enoates, ensulfones, and enamides but solvent independent for the enones. Excellent diastereoselectivity can be achieved for the epoxy enoates, enones, and ensulfones, while the enamides afford modest diastereoselectivity under optimal conditions. The MIRC reaction can be achieved with phenylmagnesium chloride and these substrates under reaction conditions designed to minimize biphenyl formation.									8	0	0	5	0	8			0022-3263			WOS:000329077900013	24195748
