J	Sears, Michael W.; Angilletta, Michael J., Jr.								Costs and Benefits of Thermoregulation Revisited: Both the Heterogeneity and Spatial Structure of Temperature Drive Energetic Costs								AMERICAN NATURALIST				185	4			E94	E102					APR 2015	2015	In recent years, ecologists have stepped up to address the challenges imposed by rapidly changing climates. Some researchers have developed niche-based methods to predict how species will shift their ranges. Such methods have evolved rapidly, resulting in models that incorporate physiological and behavioral mechanisms. Despite their sophistication, these models fail to account for environmental heterogeneity at the scale of an organism. We used an individual-based model to quantify the effects of operative environmental temperatures, as well as their heterogeneity and spatial structure, on the thermoregulation, movement, and energetics of ectotherms. Our simulations showed that the heterogeneity and spatial structure of a thermal landscape are as important as its mean temperature. In fact, temperature and heterogeneity interact to determine organismal performance. Consequently, the popular index of environmental quality (de), which ignores variance and spatial structure, is inherently flawed as a descriptor of the thermal quality of an environment. Future efforts to model species' distributions should link thermoregulation and activity to environmental heterogeneity at fine scales.									31	0	0	30	0	31			0003-0147	1537-5323		WOS:000351859700003	25811092

Descriptive sensory analysis was conducted and the 5 sensory attributes of meaty, caramel, umami, continuity, and off-flavor were used for evaluation. A sample group containing 65.00% chicken base had high scores for meaty note. A sample group containing 86.67% had a high score for caramel note. The electronic nose was used for measurement of flavor quality changes based on a metal oxide sensor (MOS) array. GC-MS was used for identification of volatile compounds. Heterocyclic sulfur and nitrogen oxygen compounds (especially 2-methyl-3-furanthiol, 2-methyl-furan, 2-pentyl-furan, 2-acetyl-furan, bis (2-methyl-3-furyl) disulfide, furfural, 2-acetyl-pyrrole, 1-methyl-pyrrole, thiazole, and 4-methyl-thiazole) were responsible for meaty and caramel attributes. Statistical analysis was used to interpret the distribution of samples and correlations among variations.									0	1	0	0	0	1			1226-7708	2092-6456		WOS:000351862100004

Nitric Oxide Stimulates Matrix Synthesis and Deposition by Adult Human Aortic Smooth Muscle Cells Within Three-Dimensional Cocultures								TISSUE ENGINEERING PART A				21	7-8			1455	1470		10.1089/ten.tea.2014.0363			APR 1 2015	2015	Vascular diseases are characterized by the over-proliferation and migration of aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) within the vessel wall, leading to compromise in cell-cell and cell-matrix signaling pathways. Tissue engineering approaches to regulate SMC over-proliferation and enhance healthy ECM synthesis showed promise, but resulted in low crosslinking efficiency. Here, we report the benefits of exogenous nitric oxide (NO) cues, delivered from S-Nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), to cell proliferation and matrix deposition by adult human aortic SMCs (HA-SMCs) within three-dimensional (3D) biomimetic cocultures. A coculture platform with two adjacent, permeable 3D culture chambers was developed to enable paracrine signaling between vascular cells. HA-SMCs were cultured in these chambers within collagen hydrogels, either alone or in the presence of human aortic endothelial cells (HA-ECs) cocultures, and exogenously supplemented with varying GSNO dosages (0-100 nM) for 21 days. Results showed that EC cocultures stimulated SMC proliferation within GSNO-free cultures. With increasing GSNO concentration, HA-SMC proliferation decreased in the presence or absence of EC cocultures, while HA-EC proliferation increased. GSNO (100 nM) significantly enhanced the protein amounts synthesized by HA-SMCs, in the presence or absence of EC cocultures, while lower dosages (1-10 nM) offered marginal benefits. Multi-fold increases in the synthesis and deposition of elastin, glycosaminoglycans, hyaluronic acid, and lysyl oxidase crosslinking enzyme (LOX) were noted at higher GSNO dosages, and coculturing with ECs significantly furthered these trends. Similar increases in TIMP-1 and MMP-9 levels were noted within cocultures with increasing GSNO dosages. Such increases in matrix synthesis correlated with NO-stimulated increases in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression within EC and SMC cultures, respectively. Results attest to the benefits of delivering NO cues to suppress SMC proliferation and promote robust ECM synthesis and deposition by adult human SMCs, with significant applications in tissue engineering, biomaterial scaffold development, and drug delivery.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1937-3341	1937-335X		WOS:000352613600025	25597545

Allosteric Regulation of Lactobacillus plantarum Xylulose 5-Phosphate/Fructose 6-Phosphate Phosphoketolase (Xfp)								JOURNAL OF BACTERIOLOGY				197	7			1157	1163		10.1128/JB.02380-14			APR 2015	2015	Xylulose 5-phosphate/fructose 6-phosphate phosphoketolase (Xfp), which catalyzes the conversion of xylulose 5-phosphate (X5P) or fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) to acetyl phosphate, plays a key role in carbohydrate metabolism in a number of bacteria. Recently, we demonstrated that the fungal Cryptococcus neoformans Xfp2 exhibits both substrate cooperativity for all substrates (X5P, F6P, and Pi) and allosteric regulation in the forms of inhibition by phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), oxaloacetic acid (OAA), and ATP and activation by AMP (K. Glenn, C. Ingram-Smith, and K. S. Smith. Eukaryot Cell 13:657-663, 2014). Allosteric regulation has not been reported previously for the characterized bacterial Xfps. Here, we report the discovery of substrate cooperativity and allosteric regulation among bacterial Xfps, specifically the Lactobacillus plantarum Xfp. L. plantarum Xfp is an allosteric enzyme inhibited by PEP, OAA, and glyoxylate but unaffected by the presence of ATP or AMP. Glyoxylate is an additional inhibitor to those previously reported for C. neoformans Xfp2. As with C. neoformans Xfp2, PEP and OAA share the same or possess overlapping sites on L. plantarum Xfp. Glyoxylate, which had the lowest half-maximal inhibitory concentration of the three inhibitors, binds at a separate site. This study demonstrates that substrate cooperativity and allosteric regulation may be common properties among bacterial and eukaryotic Xfp enzymes, yet important differences exist between the enzymes in these two domains.IMPORTANCEXylulose 5-phosphate/fructose 6-phosphate phosphoketolase (Xfp) plays a key role in carbohydrate metabolism in a number of bacteria. Although we recently demonstrated that the fungal Cryptococcus Xfp is subject to substrate cooperativity and allosteric regulation, neither phenomenon has been reported for a bacterial Xfp. Here, we report that the Lactobacillus plantarum Xfp displays substrate cooperativity and is allosterically inhibited by phosphoenolpyruvate and oxaloacetate, as is the case for Cryptococcus Xfp. The bacterial enzyme is unaffected by the presence of AMP or ATP, which act as a potent activator and inhibitor of the fungal Xfp, respectively. Our results demonstrate that substrate cooperativity and allosteric regulation may be common properties among bacterial and eukaryotic Xfps, yet important differences exist between the enzymes in these two domains.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0021-9193	1098-5530		WOS:000350767900002	25605308	
J	Krimmel, Billy A.; Wheeler, Alfred G., Jr.								Host-plant stickiness disrupts novel ant-mealybug association								ARTHROPOD-PLANT INTERACTIONS				9	2			187	195		10.1007/s11829-015-9360-5			APR 2015	2015	Ants commonly engage in facultative mutualisms with honeydew-excreting homopterans such as mealybugs and other scale insects. Attendant ants obtain a high-energy carbohydrate of predictable availability, while the homopteran trophobiont gains protection from natural enemies and potential benefits of sanitation (honeydew removal), maintenance of host-plant quality, and transport. In a California, USA, arboretum, we observed large numbers of dead and dying Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) that had become entrapped on viscid flower buds and flowers of South African species of Erica as they attempted to tend a South African mealybug (Delottococcus confusus). Mealybugs on viscid ericas were found on clusters of small buds before they had become sticky (and later in other areas that minimized exposure to stickiness). As buds developed, they became viscid, enclosing mealybugs within sticky flower parts and precluding further attendance by ants. Ants, however, were able to tend mealybugs without disruption on nonsticky ericas. Counts (n = 118) of haphazardly chosen stems of sticky ericas showed that significantly more dead ants were present on mealybug-infested stems. We suggest that evolutionary histories help explain the disparate outcomes for ants and mealybugs on sticky ericas. The Argentine ant lacks an evolutionary history with sticky ericas, whereas the native South African mealybug presumably shares an evolutionary relationship with species of Erica in South Africa's Cape Floristic Region. We propose that the mealybug's behavior and waxy coating are adaptations for circumventing plant stickiness. Our observations might represent the first documentation of plant stickiness disrupting an ant-homopteran association.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1872-8855	1872-8847		WOS:000351514300008

Ovariectomy in young prepubertal dairy heifers causes complete suppression of mammary progesterone receptors								DOMESTIC ANIMAL ENDOCRINOLOGY				51				8	18		10.1016/j.domaniend.2014.10.002			APR 2015	2015	Mammary growth and development depends on ovarian steroids and particularly interaction of estrogen and progesterone with their intracellular receptors. The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of ovariectomy on the expression of protein and messenger RNA for estrogen receptor-alpha (ESR1) and progesterone receptor (PGR) and their relation to mammary ductal development and cell proliferation. Prepubertal Holstein heifers 2, 3, or 4 mo of age were randomly assigned to one of 2 treatments, ovariectomized (OVX; n = 8) or sham operated (INT; n = 12). Mammary parenchymal (PAR) tissue samples were harvested 30 d after surgery. Localization and quantitation of ESR1 and PGR in PAR were determined by immunohistochemistry and quantitative multispectral imaging. Relative messenger RNA expression of ESR1 and PGR in PAR was measured by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction. We observed the complete absence of PGR-positive epithelial cell nuclei and reduced PGR transcript abundance in mammary parenchyma of OVX heifers. The percent of epithelial cells expressing ESR1 did not differ by treatment but was decreased with age. However, average intensity of ESR1 expression per cell Was reduced in OVX heifers. The abundance of Ki67 labeled epithelial cells, and stromal cells was' reduced after ovariectomy. These data suggest that reduced mammary development after ovariectomy may be mediated by loss of PGR expression and reduced ESR1 expression in positive cells. A presumptive relationship with ovarian-derived circulating estradiol remains unresolved, but data suggest other ovarian-derived agents may play a role. Use of specific antagonists to manipulate expression or action of PGR and ESR1 receptors should provide direct evidence for roles of these receptors in prepubertal bovine mammary development.

J	Kneip, Alois; Simar, Leopold; Wilson, Paul W.								WHEN BIAS KILLS THE VARIANCE: CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREMS FOR DEA AND FDH EFFICIENCY SCORES								ECONOMETRIC THEORY				31	2			394	422		10.1017/S0266466614000413			APR 2015	2015	Data envelopment analysis (DEA) and free disposal hull (FDH) estimators are widely used to estimate efficiencies of production units. In applications, both efficiency scores for individual units as well as average efficiency scores are typically reported. While several bootstrap methods have been developed for making inference about the efficiencies of individual units, until now no methods have existed for making inference about mean efficiency levels. This paper shows that standard central limit theorems do not apply in the case of means of DEA or FDH efficiency scores due to the bias of the individual scores, which is of larger order than either the variance or covariances among individual scores. The main difficulty comes from the fact that such statistics depend on efficiency estimators evaluated at random points. Here, new central limit theorems are developed for means of DEA and FDH scores, and their efficacy for inference about mean efficiency levels is examined via Monte Carlo experiments.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0266-4666	1469-4360		WOS:000351296500009		
J	Pandey, A.; Medlock, J.								The introduction of dengue vaccine may temporarily cause large spikes in prevalence								EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION				143	6			1276	1286		10.1017/S0950268814001939			APR 2015	2015	A dengue vaccine is expected to be available within a few years. Once vaccine is available, policy-makers will need to develop suitable policies to allocate the vaccine. Mathematical models of dengue transmission predict complex temporal patterns in prevalence, driven by seasonal oscillations in mosquito abundance. In particular, vaccine introduction may induce a transient period immediately after vaccine introduction where prevalence can spike higher than in the pre-vaccination period. These spikes in prevalence could lead to doubts about the vaccination programme among the public and even among decision-makers, possibly impeding the vaccination programme. Using simple dengue transmission models, we found that large transient spikes in prevalence are robust phenomena that occur when vaccine coverage and vaccine efficacy are not either both very high or both very low. Despite the presence of transient spikes in prevalence, the models predict that vaccination does always reduce the total number of infections in the 15 years after vaccine introduction. We conclude that policy-makers should prepare for spikes in prevalence after vaccine introduction to mitigate the burden of these spikes and to accurately measure the effectiveness of the vaccine programme.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0950-2688	1469-4409		WOS:000351415600017	25111156	
J	Chen, Kang; Shen, Haiying								Maximizing P2P File Access Availability in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks though Replication for Efficient File Sharing								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS				64	4			1029	1042		10.1109/TC.2014.2308211			APR 2015	2015	File sharing applications in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) have attracted more and more attention in recent years. The efficiency of file querying suffers from the distinctive properties of such networks including node mobility and limited communication range and resource. An intuitive method to alleviate this problem is to create file replicas in the network. However, despite the efforts on file replication, no research has focused on the global optimal replica creation with minimum average querying delay. Specifically, current file replication protocols in mobile ad hoc networks have two shortcomings. First, they lack a rule to allocate limited resources to different files in order to minimize the average querying delay. Second, they simply consider storage as available resources for replicas, but neglect the fact that the file holders' frequency of meeting other nodes also plays an important role in determining file availability. Actually, a node that has a higher meeting frequency with others provides higher availability to its files. This becomes even more evident in sparsely distributed MANETs, in which nodes meet disruptively. In this paper, we introduce a new concept of resource for file replication, which considers both node storage and meeting frequency. We theoretically study the influence of resource allocation on the average querying delay and derive a resource allocation rule to minimize the average querying delay. We further propose a distributed file replication protocol to realize the proposed rule. Extensive trace-driven experiments with synthesized traces and real traces show that our protocol can achieve shorter average querying delay at a lower cost than current replication protocols.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0018-9340	1557-9956		WOS:000351458800011

Using large sample archival data from multiple state agencies, we examined the relationships between early adverse experiences and adolescent childbearing in a sample of 70,200 females, one half of whom had juvenile delinquency histories. Females who had been committed to Child Protective Services, had received a DSM-IV diagnosis for a mental health disorder from the State Department of Mental Health, had been classified in school as having a school-related disability such as a learning disability, or who were eligible for free or reduced lunch were significantly more likely than other females to bear a child during the teen years. The strongest association between childhood risk and teen childbearing involved juvenile delinquency; girls who had been referred to the state juvenile justice department were 3 A1/2 times more likely to have a child while still a teenager than girls who had not been arrested. Race and income (free/reduced lunch) were also associated with teen childbearing. Associations between teen childbearing and mental health problems/risk indicators remained strong even for teens who had not been involved in the juvenile justice system. Implications for prevention/reduction of adolescent childbearing were examined.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1062-1024	1573-2843		WOS:000351509700014

One particular prognostic technique, support vector regression, has had successful applications because of its ability to compromise between fitting accuracy and model complexity in training prediction models. In civil engineering applications, compromise between fitting accuracy and model complexity depends primarily on the measured response of the system to loads other than those that are of interest for prognostic evaluation, referred to as extraneous noise in this paper. To achieve accurate prognostic evaluation in the presence of such extraneous noise, this paper presents an approach for optimally weighing fitting accuracy and complexity of a support vector regression model in an iterative manner as new measurements become available. The proposed approach is demonstrated in prognostic evaluation of the structural condition of a historic masonry coastal fortification, Fort Sumter located in Charleston, South Carolina, considering differential settlement of supports. Within this case study, the adaptive optimal weighting approach had increased forecasting accuracy over the non-weighted option.

Currently, battery cycle- and calendar-life represents one of the greatest uncertainties in the total life-cycle cost of battery systems. The field of battery aging modeling and prognosis has seen progress with respect to model-based and data-driven approaches to describe the aging of battery cells. However, in real world applications cells are interconnected and aging propagates. The propagation of aging from one cell to others exhibits itself in a reduced battery system life. This paper proposes a control-oriented battery pack model that describes the propagation of aging and its effect on the life span of battery systems. The modeling approach is such that it is able to predict pack aging, thermal, and electrical dynamics under actual PHEV operation, and includes consideration of random variability of the cells, electrical topology and thermal management. The modeling approach is based on the interaction between dynamic system models of the electrical and thermal dynamics, and dynamic models of cell aging. The system-level state-of-health (SOH) is assessed based on knowledge of individual cells SOH, pack electrical topology and voltage equalization approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Civil Engineering Faculty Incorporation of Sustainability in Courses and Relation to Sustainability Beliefs								JOURNAL OF PROFESSIONAL ISSUES IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION AND PRACTICE				141	2	SI				C4014005	10.1061/(ASCE)EI.1943-5541.0000225			APR 2015	2015	Professional practice within civil and environmental engineering demands that practitioners within the field have knowledge of sustainability. Engineering education has attempted to reflect this standard, as noted in statements of expected student outcomes from ABET. Yet, the degree of integration of sustainability in engineering education is varied and inconsistent across and within institutions of higher learning. In order to address this issue, this study investigates one of the potential barriers to integrating sustainability into undergraduate engineering classrooms: educators' beliefs regarding sustainability. The two-fold relationship between civil engineering faculty beliefs about sustainability and actual practice of integrating and incorporating sustainability within their classrooms is investigated in this study. Using thematic analysis of semistructured interview data; we present three personas that emerged from the data set. These personas represent characteristics shared among participants' statements of beliefs and practices in a detailed, descriptive manner. This enables shortening the distance between the study participants, our interpretations of the participants' statements, and potential readers' immediate use of these interpretations. The three personas that emerged from the data set revealed a complex relationship between what faculty members believed the field expects of students' knowledge, the relative importance of sustainability within the curriculum, and their own personal beliefs regarding sustainability in everyday life. By providing insights into these complex relationships, this study fulfills a critical step in developing more effective ways to successfully integrate sustainability within undergraduate engineering classrooms.

EM software can serve as a decision-making tool for professionals throughout various stages of building delivery. This case study describes methods to expose students, who are enrolled in a sustainable design and construction course, to building information modeling (BIM)-based EM capabilities and limitations. The case study focuses on documenting the implementation of a teaching module focused on energy modeling in which students modify location, insulation, and window glazing of a single family home preprogramed into BIM software. After instructor demonstration, students perform an EM analysis for additional locations as homework and answer a question set based on their EM results. The results indicate that students had minor issues interpreting the EM results because they did not fully examine the outputs produced from the energy model to inform their answers on the teaching module homework assignment. Overall, however, research findings suggest that implementing such a teaching module can improve student confidence and perception of EM use in construction delivery decisions. This paper provides an example for educators to include BIM EM or similar teaching modules into sustainable design and construction-related courses.

During the precursor synthesis, the hydrolysis was controlled to obtain highly viscous mullite sols. The viscous mullite sols were then diluted and mixed with a small amount of polyethylene oxide. Controlling the precursor rheology and spinning conditions, we obtained mullite fibers with the relatively uniform microstructure and narrow diameter distributions for each e-spinning condition. We carried out the mechanical tests for the electrospun mullite fibers since the mechanical performances of e-spin ceramic fibers have not been often reported. The tensile strengths of electrospun mullite fibers were determined using the single filament tensile test. The average tensile strength was 1.46 GPa for 5 mm gauge length, and 1.25 GPa for 10 mm gauge length. The Weibull modulus was estimated to be 3-4, which is comparable to commercial ceramic fibers. The fiber exhibited an average elastic modulus of 100 GPa. In this study, we show that controlling the hydrolysis can reduce the polymer additive amount required for electrospinning. Thus the electrospun mullite fiber has the similar mechanical properties to the dry spun counterparts.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0928-0707	1573-4846		WOS:000351541200025

Honeycomb cellular structures offer many distinct advantages over homogenous materials because their effective material properties depend on both their constituent material properties and their geometric cell configuration. From these structures, a wide range of targeted effective material properties can be achieved thus supporting forward design-by-tailoring honeycomb cellular structures for specific applications. One area that has not been fully explored is the set of acoustic properties of honeycomb and understanding of how designers can effectively tune designs in different frequency ranges. One such example is the insulation of target sound frequencies to prevent sound transmission through a panel. This work explored the effect of geometry of in-plane honeycomb cores in sandwich panels on the acoustic properties the panel. The two acoustic responses of interest are the general level of sound transmission loss (STL) of the panel and the location of the resonance frequencies that exhibit high levels of sound transmission, or low sound pressure transmission loss. Constant mass honeycomb core models were studied with internal cell angles ranging in increments from -45 deg to +45 deg. Effective honeycomb moduli based on static analysis of honeycomb unit cells are calculated and correlated to the shift in resonance frequencies for the different geometries, with all panels having the same total mass. This helps explain the direction of resonance frequency shift found in the panel natural frequency solutions. Results show an interesting trend of the first resonance frequencies in relation to effective structural properties. Honeycomb geometries with smaller core internal cell angles, under constant mass constraints, shifted natural frequencies lower, and had more resonances in the 1-1000 Hz range, but exhibited a higher sound pressure transmission loss between resonant frequencies.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1048-9002	1528-8927		WOS:000350966700011		
J	He, Qifan; Daqaq, Mohammed F.								New Insights Into Utilizing Bistability for Energy Harvesting Under White Noise								JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND ACOUSTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME				137	2					021009	10.1115/1.4029008			APR 2015	2015	This paper investigates the response of a bistable energy harvester to random excitations that can be approximated by a white noise process. Statistical linearization (SL), direct numerical integration of the stochastic differential equations, and finite element (FE) solution of the Fokker-Plank-Kolmogorov (FPK) equation are utilized to understand how the shape of the potential energy function influences the mean output power of the harvester. It is observed that, both of the FE solution and the direct numerical integration provide close predictions for the mean power regardless of the shape of the potential energy function. SL, on the other hand, yields nonunique and erroneous predictions unless the potential energy function has shallow potential wells. It is shown that the mean power exhibits a maximum value at an optimal potential shape. This optimal shape is not directly related to the shape that maximizes the mean square displacement even when the time constant ratio, i.e., ratio between the time constants of the mechanical and electrical systems is small. Maximizing the mean square displacement yields a potential shape with a global maximum (unstable potential) for any value of the time constant ratio and any noise intensity, whereas maximizing the average power yields a bistable potential which possesses deeper potential wells for larger noise intensities and vise versa. Away from the optimal shape, the average power drops significantly highlighting the importance of characterizing the noise intensity of the vibration source prior to designing a bistable harvester for the purpose of harnessing energy from white noise excitations. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that, the optimal time constant ratio is not necessarily small which challenges previous conceptions that a bistable harvester provides better output power when the time constant ratio is small. While maximum variation of the mean power with the nonlinearity occurs for smaller values of the time constant ratio, this does not necessarily correspond to the optimal performance of the harvester.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1048-9002	1528-8927		WOS:000350966700009		
J	Nahar-Gohad, Pranjal; Gohad, Neeraj; Tsai, Chen-Chih; Bordia, Rajendra; Vyavahare, Naren								Rat Aortic Smooth Muscle Cells Cultured on Hydroxyapatite Differentiate into Osteoblast-Like Cells via BMP-2-SMAD-5 Pathway								CALCIFIED TISSUE INTERNATIONAL				96	4			359	369		10.1007/s00223-015-9962-z			APR 2015	2015	Vascular calcification is an important pathological condition associated with increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. Hydroxyapatite (HA) found in such deposits is the same polymorph of calcium (Ca) found in bone, indicating calcification may involve mechanisms akin to bone formation. Vascular smooth muscle cells (Vsmcs) have been shown to undergo phenotypic change to osteoblast-like cells. However, the mechanisms underlying this phenotypic change are unclear, and whether the stimulus to become osteogenic is a result of loss of mineralization inhibitors or early mineral deposits is not known. Our aim in this study is to identify mechanisms and signal transduction pathways that cause differentiation of Vsmcs into osteoblast-like cells in the presence of HA. We first characterized vascular origin of Vsmcs by studying the expression of smooth muscle cell markers: myosin heavy chain and smooth muscle actin along with SM22 alpha at both mRNA and protein levels. Vsmcs grown on HA exhibited progressive change in cellular morphology at 3-, 7-, and 14-day time points. Culturing of Vsmcs on HA disc resulted in decrease in media Ca levels and increased expression of Ca-sensing receptor (CaSR) on Vsmcs resulting in upregulation of intracellular CaSR signaling leading to increased BMP-2 secretion. BMP-2 pathway mediated differentiation of Vsmcs to osteoblast-like cells shown by expression of osteogenic markers like runt-related transcription factor 2, osteocalcin, and alkaline phosphatase at mRNA and protein levels. Blocking CaSR by NPS-2143 reduced BMP-2 secretion and blocking the BMP-2 pathway by LDN-193189, a BMP inhibitor, modulated expression of osteogenic markers confirming their role in osteogenesis of Vsmcs.									4	0	0	3	0	4			0171-967X	1432-0827		WOS:000351198600010	25725805

Using laboratory mice, we artificially selected for high maximal mass-independent metabolic rate (MMR) without direct selection on mass-independent basal metabolic rate (BMR). Then we tested for responses to selection in MMR and correlated responses to selection in BMR. In other lines, we antagonistically selected for mice with a combination of high mass-independent MMR and low mass-independent BMR. All selection protocols and data analyses included body mass as a covariate, so effects of selection on the metabolic rates are mass adjusted (that is, independent of effects of body mass). The selection lasted eight generations. Compared with controls, MMR was significantly higher (11.2%) in lines selected for increased MMR, and BMR was slightly, but not significantly, higher (2.5%). Compared with controls, MMR was significantly higher (5.3%) in antagonistically selected lines, and BMR was slightly, but not significantly, lower (4.2%). Analysis of breeding values revealed no positive genetic trend for elevated BMR in high-MMR lines. A weak positive genetic correlation was detected between MMR and BMR. That weak positive genetic correlation supports the aerobic capacity model for the evolution of endothermy in the sense that it fails to falsify a key model assumption. Overall, the results suggest that at least in these mice there is significant capacity for independent evolution of metabolic traits. Whether that is true in the ancestral animals that evolved endothermy remains an important but unanswered question.									5	0	0	5	0	5			0018-067X	1365-2540		WOS:000350882200007	25604947

CBM system architectures investigated in this work include an independent monitoring and control unit with no communication with machine control (Architecture 1) and a data acquisition and control unit integrated with the machine control (Architecture 2). Based on these architectures, three different CBM system applications are discussed and deployed. A verification of the third system was done by performing a destructive bearing test, causing a spindle to seize due to lubrication starvation. This test validated the CBM system developed, as well as provided insights into using sensor fusion for a better detection of bearing failure. The second part of the work discusses intelligence in a CBM system using a Bayesian probabilistic decision framework and data generated while running validation tests, it is demonstrated how the Na < ve Bayes classifier can aid in the decision making of stopping the machine before catastrophic failure occurs. Discussing value in combining information supplied by more than one sensor (sensor fusion), it is demonstrated how a catastrophic failure can be prevented. The work is concluded with open issues on the topic with ongoing work and future opportunities.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0956-5515	1572-8145		WOS:000351138700010

In this work, we studied Pr3+ upconversion in an oxyfluoride host system for the first time, employing Lu7O6F9:Pr3+ ceramics. Compared to the previously studied Y2SiO5:Pr3+ reference material, the oxyfluoride host resulted in a 5-fold increase in intermediate state lifetime, likely due to a lower maximum phonon energy; however, only a 60% gain in UC intensity was observed. To explain this discrepancy, luminescence spectral distribution and decay kinetics were studied in both phosphor systems. The Pr3+ 4f5d band energy distribution in each phosphor was found to play a key role by allowing or disallowing the occurrence of a previously unexplored UC mechanism, which had a significant impact on overall efficiency.

WHEN MUCH MORE OF A DIFFERENCE MAKES A DIFFERENCE: SOCIAL COMPARISON AND TOURNAMENTS IN THE CEO'S TOP TEAM								STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT JOURNAL				36	4			618	636		10.1002/smj.2227			APR 2015	2015	We integrate the seemingly contradictory theoretical predictions of behavioral and economic perspectives about the relationship between pay disparity and firm performance and show that tournament and social comparison theories are more supplementary than contradictory in nature. Our results show that high levels of firm performance will be found around either meaningfully low or meaningfully high levels of pay disparity. Additional findings indicate that this curvilinear relationship is weakened in the presence of both an heir apparent and high CEO power, and strengthened when top management team members are more eligible as CEOs. These findings suggest that factors that increase or inhibit social comparison or tournament perceptions among TMT members play a role in the strength of the curvilinear relationship between pay disparity and firm performance.

Examining Leadership Development Through Student Leader Outdoor Recreation Training								RECREATIONAL SPORTS JOURNAL				39	1	SI		49	58		10.1123/rsj.2014-0034			APR 2015	2015	Since their inception, student leadership development has been a consistent goal of outdoor recreation programs (ORPs). However, little research has been conducted to better understand how these experiences contribute to leadership development for college students. Using the Komives et al. (2005) model of leadership identity development, this qualitative research study examined leadership identity development in the context of a training trip for student employees of an ORP. By focusing on this particular training program, the study sought to answer the following research question: How does participating in an outdoor recreation training trip impact students' leadership identity development? The study found that the participants were navigating through the final three stages of Komives et al.'s (2005) leadership model: leadership differentiated, generativity, and integration/synthesis stages. Participants understood the role of positional leaders and that there were others who were able to lead without holding titles or positions; participants were able to articulate the role of leaders in helping others and sustaining the program; and participants also articulated how these experiences related to their lives beyond ORP trips, achieving the reflective goals of the integration and synthesis. The results highlight the importance of communication and teamwork in leadership development. The findings provide evidence of the role of ORP in enhancing student leadership identity and make the case for continued or expanded support for these programs. The findings of this study provide insight into how student leadership identity development takes place when students are involved in ORP experiences.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1558-8661	1558-867X		WOS:000373057600006

Bacterial and viral induction of chicken thrombocyte inflammatory responses								DEVELOPMENTAL AND COMPARATIVE IMMUNOLOGY				49	2			225	230		10.1016/j.dci.2014.11.019			APR 2015	2015	Thrombocytes express Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that detect bacterial or viral pathogens to signal the release of cytokines and mediators. We examined inflammatory responses when thrombocytes were exposed to four TLR ligands. Treatment of thrombocytes with TLR ligands demonstrates differential effects on gene expression of interleukin (IL)-6. Among the TLR ligands examined, lipopolysaccharide stimulation led to the most significant up-regulation of the IL-6 gene and a significant amount of active IL-6 in thrombocyte culture media. Lipoteichoic acid stimulation led to only marginal up-regulation of IL-6 gene expression. Although gene expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) did not increase due to different ligand exposure, a low level constitutive expression of iNOS was observed in all cases. Only thrombocytes treated with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid and thymidine homopolymer phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides induced rapid, significant production of nitric oxide. We also observed that thrombocytes are able to respond faster upon TLR ligand exposure compared to MQNCSU macrophages. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Analysis of the broadening of the annihilation photopeak revealed the presence of the same type of defect in all samples. The lack of long lifetimes (tau a parts per thousand yen 2 ns) suggested no positronium formation or the lack of trapping sites large enough to trap positronium for long enough time for the annihilation to be observed. Analysis of positron annihilation lifetime revealed the presence of a single lifetime that ranged from 208 to 219 ps, depending on the sintering conditions. These results also suggest the absence of a significant presence of vacancy clusters and other larger open-volume defects, and that the dominant open-volume defect corresponds to monovacancies and/or complex defects associated with monovacancies. The bulk lifetime of Er-doped scandia is estimated to be equal or lower than 208 ps.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000349969800019

Review and Evaluation of Faith-Based Weight Management Interventions That Target African American Women								JOURNAL OF RELIGION & HEALTH				54	2			798	809		10.1007/s10943-014-9912-5			APR 2015	2015	This integrative review was conducted to present results of the use of recommended criteria to evaluate faith-based weight management interventions (WMIs) that target African American women. This group experiences the highest prevalence of adult obesity in the US when compared to other ethnic groups. "Best practice" WMIs can help to alleviate obesity. Faith-based interventions hold promise for helping to address the problem of obesity in African American women since a significant portion of these persons views the church as a trusted entity that advocates for their well-being. No systematic evaluation of faith-based WMIs has been reported even though there is an ongoing plea for the need for better evaluation of health interventions that prioritizes comprehensive description of their attributes (e.g., linkage to theory, interventionists' background, and dosage) to enable replication and a broader assessment of their validity to include appropriateness and feasibility). Critique criteria were applied to faith-based WMIs (n = 5) that target African American women. Findings highlighted the need for increased disclosure about the (1) interventionists' background, (2) intervention's location within the church setting, and (3) nature of any "pre-intervention" treatment. The review also indicated the need for interventions that are (1) designed from robust research methodologies (effectiveness) that include randomization of both church setting and participants, (2) deemed appropriate from the perspective of African American women targeted, and (3) are financially feasible-without steep participant incentives/implementation costs that compromise internal validity and any positive outcomes generated.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0022-4197	1573-6571		WOS:000349604800032	25015128

Renewable energy sources are useful for sustainable monitoring, but still very limited today due to various implementation constraints. Fortunately, microbial fuel cells (MFCs) provide a renewable power source, which can be integrated into terrains, wetlands, and some civil structures for environmental monitoring. However, as MFCs may only provide ultralow and dynamic power, an energy-neutral communication protocol is crucial for MFC-powered WSNs. Herein a duty-cycle-based energy-neutral communication protocol is proposed for MFC-powered WSNs. Mathematical models for optimal duty-cycling that minimize the probe packet reception time are first proposed. Then, an energy-neutral joint scheduling and routing protocol in multihop MFC networks is introduced. Finally, a MATLAB-based simulation tool is developed to evaluate the protocol performance. Simulation results show that WSNs adopting the proposed protocol can achieve sustainable network operations. It is also demonstrated that the protocol enables reliable data transmission when using ultralow and time-varying MFC power inputs.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1530-437X	1558-1748		WOS:000349622800018

The combination of two different demand patterns can be observed in many areas, such as healthcare inventory and humanitarian supply chain management. The surge demand has a lower arrival rate but higher demand volume per arrival. The solution approach proposed in this paper incorporates the level crossing method and mixed integer programming technique to optimize the hybrid inventory policy with both regular orders and emergency orders. The level crossing method is applied to obtain the equilibrium distributions of inventory levels under a given policy. The model is further transformed into a mixed integer program to identify an optimal hybrid policy. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to investigate the impact of parameters on the optimal inventory policy and minimum cost. Numerical results clearly show the benefit of using the proposed hybrid inventory model. The model and solution approach could help healthcare providers or humanitarian logistics providers in managing their emergency supplies in responding to surge demands. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Phylogenetic analysis of all Citrus NBS genes across these three genomes revealed that there are three approximately evenly numbered groups: one group contains the Toll-Interleukin receptor (TIR) domain and two different Non-TIR groups in which most of proteins contain the Coiled Coil (CC) domain. Motif analysis confirmed that the two groups of CC-containing NBS genes are from different evolutionary origins. We partitioned NBS genes into clades using NBS domain sequence distances and found most clades include NBS genes from all three Citrus genomes. This suggests that three Citrus genomes have similar numbers and types of NBS genes. We also mapped the re-sequenced reads of three pomelo and three mandarin genomes onto the C. sinensis genome. We found that most NBS genes of the hybrid C. sinensis genome have corresponding homologous genes in both pomelo and mandarin genomes. The homologous NBS genes in pomelo and mandarin suggest that the parental species of C. sinensis may contain similar types of NBS genes. This explains why the hybrid C. sinensis and original C. clementina have similar types of NBS genes in this study. Furthermore, we found that sequence variation amongst Citrus NBS genes were shaped by multiple independent and shared accelerated mutation accumulation events among different groups of NBS genes and in different Citrus genomes. Our comparative analyses yield valuable insight into the structure, organization and evolution of NBS genes in Citrus genomes. Furthermore, our comprehensive analysis showed that the non-TIR NBS genes can be divided into two groups that come from different evolutionary origins. This provides new insights into non-TIR genes, which have not received much attention.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1932-6203			WOS:000356353700155	25811466

Here we show that, in quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) time-reversal-invariant topological superconductors (class DIII), a realistic model for superconducting lithium molybdenum purple bronze (Li0.9Mo6O17) and certain families of organic superconductors, multiple Majorana-Kramers pairs with strongly overlapping wave functions persist at zero energy even in the absence of an easily identifiable symmetry. We find that similar results hold in the case of Q1D semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures (class D) with t(perpendicular to) << t, where t(perpendicular to) and t are the transverse and longitudinal hoppings, respectively. Our results, explained in terms of special properties of the Hamiltonian and wave functions, underscore the importance of hidden accidental symmetries in topological superconductors.									4	0	1	0	0	5			1098-0121	1550-235X		WOS:000351875800002

Excellent stability is established for these superlattices by maintaining the crystal structure and reproducing the TE properties after long-time (20 h) annealing at high temperature (similar to 1000 K). The introduction of oxygen vacancies as well as extrinsic dopants (Pr3+ and Nb5+), with different masses and ionic radii, at different lattice sites in SPTO and STNO layers, respectively, results in a substantial reduction of thermal conductivity via scattering a wider range of phonon spectrum without limiting the electrical transport and thermopower, leading to an enhancement in the figure-of-merit (ZT). The superlattice composed of 20 SPTO/STNO pairs, 8 unit cells of each layer, exhibits a ZT value of 0.46 at 1000 K, which is the highest among SrTiO3-based thermoelectrics.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0897-4756	1520-5002		WOS:000351971600034

Antonio; Hemphill, Carrie A.; Ritson-Williams, Raphael					Baeza, Juan Antonio/0000-0002-2573-6773			The Sexual and Mating System of the Shrimp Odontonia katoi (Palaemonidae, Pontoniinae), a Symbiotic Guest of the Ascidian Polycarpa aurata in the Coral Triangle								PLOS ONE				10	3					e0121120	10.1371/journal.pone.0121120			MAR 23 2015	2015	Theory predicts that monogamy is adaptive in symbiotic crustaceans inhabiting relatively small and morphologically simple hosts in tropical environments where predation risk away from hosts is high. We tested this prediction in the shrimp Odontonia katoi, which inhabits the atrial chamber of the ascidian Polycarpa aurata in the Coral Triangle. Preliminary observations in O. katoi indicated that males were smaller than females, which is suggestive of sex change (protandry) in some symbiotic organisms. Thus, we first investigated the sexual system of O. katoi to determine if this shrimp was sequentially hermaphroditic. Morphological identification and size frequency distributions indicated that the population comprised males that, on average, were smaller than females. Gonad dissections demonstrated the absence of transitional individuals. Thus, O. katoi is a gonochoric species with reverse sexual dimorphism. The population distribution of O. katoi in its ascidian host did not differ significantly from a random distribution and shrimps inhabiting the same host individual as pairs were found with a frequency similar to that expected by chance alone. This is in contrast to that reported for other socially monogamous crustaceans in which pairs of heterosexual conspecifics are found in host individuals more frequently than expected by chance alone. Thus, the available information argues against monogamy in O. katoi. Furthermore, that a high frequency of solitary females were found brooding embryos and that the sex ratio was skewed toward females suggests that males might be roaming among hosts in search of receptive females in O. katoi. Symbiotic crustaceans can be used as a model system to understand the adaptive value of sexual and mating systems inmarine invertebrates.									2	0	0	3	0	3			1932-6203			WOS:000351987300212	25799577

To obtain one sectioned slice, three raw images with a fixed phase-shift, normally 2 pi/3, are generally required. In this paper, we report a data processing algorithm based on the one-dimensional Hilbert transform, which needs only two raw images with arbitrary phase-shift for each single slice. The proposed algorithm is different from the previous two-dimensional Hilbert spiral transform algorithm in theory. The presented algorithm has the advantages of simpler data processing procedure, faster computation speed and better reconstructed image quality. The validity of the scheme is verified by imaging biological samples in our developed DMD-based LED-illumination SIM system.									1	1	0	0	0	2			1932-6203			WOS:000351987300188	25799234

The FINDRISC was developed based on eight variables (age, BMI, waist circumference, use of antihypertensive drug, history of high blood glucose, family history of diabetes, daily physical activity and fruit & vegetable intake). The sensitivity, specificity, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the testing model were calculated for undiagnosed diabetes and pre-diabetes, determined by oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).ResultsThe prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes was 7.0% and 43.1% for pre-diabetes (27.7% for isolated impaired fasting glucose (IFG), 5.1% for impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and 10.3% for having both IFG and IGT). The sensitivity and specificity of using the HbA1c alone was 24.2% and 99.6% for diabetes (cutoff of >= 6.5%), and 35.2% and 86.4% for prediabetes (cutoff of >= 5.7%). The sensitivity and specificity of using the FINDRISC alone (cutoff of >= 9) was 79.1% and 48.6% for diabetes and 60.2% and 61.4% for pre-diabetes. Using the simultaneous testing model with a combination of FINDRISC and HbA1c improved the sensitivity to 84.2% for diabetes and 74.2% for pre-diabetes. The specificity for the simultaneous testing model was 48.4% of diabetes and 53.0% for pre-diabetes.ConclusionsThis simultaneous testing model is a practical and valid tool in diabetes screening in the general U.S. population.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1932-6203			WOS:000351425400155	25790106

However, past studies of physical activity and scholastic performance among students often relied on parent-reported grade information, and did not explore whether the association varied among different levels of scholastic performance. Our study among fifth-grade students in Shanghai sought to determine the association between regular physical activity and teacher-reported academic performance scores (APS), with special attention to the differential associational patterns across different strata of scholastic performance.MethodA total of 2,225 students were chosen through a stratified random sampling, and a complete sample of 1470 observations were used for analysis. We used a quantile regression analysis to explore whether the association between physical activity and teacher-reported APS differs by distribution of APS.ResultsMinimal-intensity physical activity such as walking was positively associated with academic performance scores (beta = 0.13, SE = 0.04). The magnitude of the association tends to be larger at the lower end of the APS distribution (beta = 0.24, SE = 0.08) than in the higher end of the distribution (beta = 0.00, SE = 0.07).ConclusionBased upon teacher-reported student academic performance, there is no evidence that spending time on frequent physical activity would undermine student's APS. Those students who are below the average in their academic performance could be worse off in academic performance if they give up minimal-intensity physical activity. Therefore, cutting physical activity time in schools could hurt the scholastic performance among those students who were already at higher risk for dropping out due to inadequate APS.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1932-6203			WOS:000351183500003	25774525

By optimizing the etching conditions, chlorine plasma is employed to produce extremely low-roughness etched sidewalls on waveguides with minimal penalty to propagation loss. Using this fabrication method, microring resonators with record-high intrinsic Q-factors as high as 450 000 and a corresponding propagation loss as low as 0.42 dB/cm are demonstrated in submicron chalcogenide waveguides. Furthermore, the developed chlorine plasma etching process is utilized to demonstrate fiber-to-waveguide grating couplers in chalcogenide photonics with high power coupling efficiency of 37% for transverse-electric polarized modes.

For the model development and validation experimental data obtained during an aging campaign is used. During the campaign the influence of charge sustaining/depleting operation, minimum state of charge (SOC), charging rate and temperature on the aging process is studied. The aging profiles, which are prescribed in power mode, are selected to be representative of realistic plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) operation. The proposed model describes capacity fade and resistance increase as function of the influencing stress factors and battery charge throughput. Due to its simplicity but still good accuracy, the applications of the proposed aging model include the design of algorithms for battery state-of-health (SOH) monitoring and prognosis, PHEV optimal energy management including battery aging, and the study of aging propagation among battery cells in advanced energy storage systems.

Unfortunately, insulating BaCO3 and Y2O3 phases formed on the surface of BZY and Ni-BZY prepared by solid state reaction method with NiO after annealing in wet CO2. Ni-BZY membranes prepared from different methods suffered different degree of performance loss in wet H-2 at 900 degrees C. The chemical instability of Ni-BZY is attributed to the formation of a secondary phase (BaY2O4) generated from the reduction of BaY2NiO5 in Hy during the sintering process. Both BaY2O4 and BaY2NiO5 react with H2O, and CO2 at elevated temperatures, generating insulating Ba(OH)(2) and BaCO3 phases, respectively. The less BaY2O4 is formed in the fabrication process, the better chemical stability the Ni BZY membranes possess. Therefore, a new Ni BZY membrane is prepared through a judicial combination of BZY powders prepared from combined EDTA-citric and solid state reaction methods, and demonstrates exceptional chemical stability in H2O and CO2, enabling stable and even improved hydrogen flux in wt 50% CO2 at 900 degrees C.

The nontrivial topological state occurs for generic parameters requiring no fine tuning, at least for very large exchange spin splitting in the wire. We theoretically obtain the signatures which appear in the presence of an arbitrary number of Majorana modes in multiwire systems incorporating the role of finite temperature, finite potential barrier at the STM tip, and finite wire length. These signatures are presented in terms of spatial profiles of STM differential conductance, which clearly reveal zero-energy Majorana end modes and the prediction of a multiple Majorana based fractional Josephson effect. A substantial part of this work is devoted to a detailed critical comparison between our theory and the recent STM experiment claiming the observation of Majorana fermions in ferromagnetic atomic chains on a superconductor. The conclusion of this detailed comparison is that although the experimental observations are not manifestly inconsistent with our theoretical findings, the very small topological superconducting gap and the very high temperature of the experiment make it impossible to decisively verify the existence of a localized Majorana zero mode, as the spectral weight of the Majorana mode is necessarily spread over a very broad energy regime exceeding the size of the gap. Such an extremely broad (and extremely weak) conductance peak could easily arise from any subgap states existing in the rather complex system studied experimentally and may or may not have anything to do with a putative Majorana zero mode as discussed in the first half of our paper. Thus, although the experimental findings are indeed consistent with a highly broadened and weakened Majorana zero-bias peak, much lower experimental temperatures (and/or much larger experimental topological superconducting gaps) are necessary for any definitive conclusion.									35	0	0	0	0	35			1098-0121	1550-235X		WOS:000351341100004

Newly developed fringe projection 3D microscopy is presented in this paper. The system is configured according to camera-projector layout and long working distance lenses. The Scheimpflug principle is employed to make full use of the limited depth of field. For such a specific system, the general imaging model is introduced to reach a full 3D reconstruction. A dedicated calibration procedure is developed to realize quantitative 3D imaging. Experiments with a prototype demonstrate the accessibility of the proposed configuration, model, and calibration approach.

Addition reactions to electron-rich or electron-deficient alkenes profit either from its electrophilic or nucleophilic properties.

Previous student success research is extended, by examining goal constructs from the AGT framework to determine if they help explain the learning process in accounting. Data were gathered using an established instrument and used to examine how mastery and performance goals are related to students' academic expectations, achievement, self-efficacy, and test anxiety. Cluster analysis was used to identify four motivation groupings (multiple-goal, mastery, performance, and low motivation). Pairwise comparisons of groups, for expected grades, self-efficacy, anxiety, final exam grade, and course grade, identified differences among some of the clusters. Results suggest that a combination of mastery and performance goal motivations, rather than a singular perspective, may provide better outcomes related to course grades, while reducing dysfunctional outcomes. Based on the results, suggestions are provided to help instructors influence student success.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0963-9284	1468-4489		WOS:000354245000005

Specifically, we argued and found that exclusion prompts ingratiatory and citizenship behaviours via the perception of being envied by colleagues. Despite these positive outcomes, we also found the mediated relationship of exclusion and perceptions of being envied to be damaging to workers' psychological health and work-related attitudes, and that these relationships were the strongest among employees with high positive affect (PA). We tested our model across two distinct samples that included full-time Dutch (Study 1) and American (Study 2) employees.

The presence of natural organic matter, such as fulvic acid (FA), may influence these parameters. We investigated the effects of FA on Pu(IV) sorption/desorption onto goethite in two scenarios: when FA was (1) initially present in solution or (2) found as organic coatings on the mineral surface. A low pH was used to maximize FA coatings on goethite. Experiments were combined with kinetic modeling and speciation calculations to interpret variations in Pu sorption rates in the presence of FA. Our results indicate that FA can change the rates and extent of Pu sorption onto goethite at pH 4. Differences in the kinetics of Pu sorption were observed as a function of the concentration and initial form of FA. The fraction of desorbed Pu decreased in the presence of FA, indicating that organic matter can stabilize sorbed Pu on goethite. These results suggest that ternary Pu-F-Amineral complexes could enhance colloid-facilitated Pu transport. However, more representative natural conditions need to be investigated to quantify the relevance of these findings.									10	0	0	6	0	10			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000350611100028	25607800

ASKHA family members share a common core fold that includes an ATPase domain with five structural motifs. The PHOSPHATE1 motif has previously been shown to be important for catalysis. We have investigated the role of two of these motifs in the Methanosarcina thermophila ACK (MtACK) and have shown that residues projecting into the ACK active site from the PHOSPHATE2 and ADENOSINE loops and a third highly conserved loop designated here as LOOP3 play key roles in nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) selection and utilization. Alteration of Asn211 of PHOSPHATE2, Gly239 of LOOP3, and Gly331 of ADENOSINE greatly reduced catalysis. In particular, Gly331, which is highly conserved throughout the ASKHA superfamily, has the greatest effect on substrate selection. Alteration at this site strongly skewed MtACK toward utilization of purines over pyrimidines, unlike the wild type enzyme that shows broad NTP utilization. Further investigation into differences between the ATPase domain in MtACK and other acetate kinases that show different substrate preferences will provide us with a better understanding of the diversity of phosphoryl donor selection in this enzyme family.									0	0	0	1	0	1			2075-1729	2075-1729		BCI:BCI201600033221	25775277

Although electroporation has been developed for the transformation of plasmids in Cryptococcus, only biolistic delivery provides an effective means to transform linear DNA that can be integrated into the genome by homologous recombination.Acetate has been shown to be a major fermentation product during cryptococcal infection, but the significance of this is not yet known. A bacterial pathway composed of the enzymes xylulose-5-phosphate/fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase (Xfp) and acetate kinase (Ack) is one of three potential pathways for acetate production in C. neoformans. Here, we demonstrate the biolistic transformation of a construct, which has the gene encoding Ack fused to the fluorescent tag mCherry, into C. neoformans. We then confirm integration of the ACK-mCherry fusion into the ACK locus.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1940-087X			WOS:000361534300069

However, it has been a great challenge to optically map calcium (Ca) transients and action potentials simultaneously from the same field of view in a cultured HL-1 atrial cell monolayer. This is because special handling and care is required to prepare healthy cells that can be electrically captured and optically mapped. Therefore, we have developed an optimal working protocol for dual channel optical mapping. In this manuscript, we have described in detail how to perform the dual channel optical mapping experiment. This protocol is a useful tool to enhance the understanding of action potential propagation and Ca kinetics in arrhythmia development.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1940-087X			WOS:000361534300042

Large-mode-area fibers are a key for the mitigation of optical nonlinearities. In recent years, mode instability has shown itself to be an additional significant limiting factor for single-mode power scaling in the regime of a few hundred watts to kilowatts. It is better appreciated now that further power scaling requires significant high-order-mode suppression in addition to a large effective mode area in a fiber. In recent years, we have shown that all-solid photonic bandgap fibers are a superior approach due to their unsurpassed higher-order-mode suppression in large-mode-area designs, making them well suited for applications at high average powers. We will review of some of the recent progress, challenges, and prospects of all-solid photonic bandgap fibers in this invited paper.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1077-260X	1558-4542		WOS:000360790500001

The aim of our program, Health Coaches for Hypertension Control, is to improve hypertension self-management among rural residents older than 60 years through education and support offered by trained community volunteers called Health Coaches. Participants received baseline and follow-up health risk appraisals with blood work, educational materials, and items such as blood pressure monitors and pedometers. Data were collected at baseline, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks on 146 participants who demonstrated statistically significant increases in hypertension-related knowledge from baseline to 8 weeks that persisted at 16 weeks, as well as significant improvements in stage of readiness to change behaviors and in actual behaviors. Furthermore, clinically significant decreases in all outcome measures were observed, with statistically significant changes in systolic blood pressure (-5.781 mmHg; p = .001), weight (-2.475 1b; p < .001), and glucose (-5.096 mg/dl; p = .004) after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Although 40.4% of participants met the Healthy People 2020 definition of controlled hypertension at baseline, the proportion of participants meeting this definition at 16 weeks postintervention increased to 51.0%. This article describes a university-community-hospital system model that effectively promotes hypertension self-management in a rural Appalachian community.									3	0	0	1	0	3			1524-8399	1552-6372		WOS:000357299900016	24837989

Classwide Teacher Implementation of Self-Regulated Strategy Development for Writing with Students with E/BD in a Residential Facility								JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL EDUCATION				24	1			88	111		10.1007/s10864-014-9207-7			MAR 2015	2015	One promising intervention to support the writing skills of students with and at risk for emotional and behavioral disorders is self-regulated strategy development (SRSD). The purpose of this study was to extend this line of inquiry to a residential setting with teachers serving as interventionists and determine the effects of the SRSD using the STOP and DARE mnemonic for persuasive writing on the writing performance (Correct Word Sequences, Essay Elements, and Essay Quality), and academic engagement of secondary students. In addition, this study extended this line of inquiry by looking at implementation of the intervention only 2 days per week, a lower treatment intensity than previous research has used to find statistically significant gains in writing. Results of a piecewise hierarchical linear model suggest statistically significant gains were made over the course of the intervention in writing and academic engagement when compared to baseline. In addition, student variables such as writing achievement, externalizing/internalizing behavior patterns, age, and attendance predicted writing and engagement. Results of generalization, fidelity, and social validity also are reported.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1053-0819	1573-3513		WOS:000356048700006

Measured compressive strength was quite high. Compared to a unidirectional composite laminate of the same composition, compressive strength values were doubled. The study shows that glass fiber composites have the potential for high compressive strength. This potential is reached with excellent fiber alignment and suitable matrix characteristics. Results of both laminate and pultruded composites are shown to be consistent with model predictions, with the primary delineating factor being fiber alignment.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-9983	1530-793X		WOS:000350310600010

A zeolite absorbent/nano-fluidics protection-based blast- and ballistic-impact-mitigation system								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE				50	5			2019	2037		10.1007/s10853-014-8779-x			MAR 2015	2015	The efficacy of a new blast-/ballistic-impact-mitigation concept is analyzed using advanced computational methods and tools. In this concept, the target structure is covered by a zeolite protective layer (with a layer of air between the two), which in turn is in contact with a water layer (treated as a nano-fluidic material) in front. The water molecules are forced to infiltrate zeolite nanopores under high-rate loading, following which the hydrogen bonds of the water molecules interact with the hydrophobic walls of the nanopores, causing the water to undergo an ordering-type phase transition and acquire high density. At the same time, a significant portion of the kinetic energy of the water molecules is converted to potential energy or dissipated as heat. All-atom molecular-level equilibrium and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations were employed to properly capture the attendant nano-fluidics phenomena. As a result, the structure sustains a substantially lower peak load, and the (conserved) linear momentum is transferred to the structure over a longer duration.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000347696500002		
J	Chowdhury, Mijanur R.; Testik, Firat Y.								Axisymmetric Underflows from Impinging Buoyant Jets of Dense Cohesive Particle-Laden Fluids								JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING				141	3					04014079	10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0000969			MAR 2015	2015	Underflows generated from the impingement of descending dense cohesive particle-laden buoyant jets on a horizontal bottom of a water body were investigated theoretically and experimentally. Laboratory experiments were conducted by discharging fluid mud (suspension of cohesive clay particles in water) at a constant volume flow rate from a submerged vertical pipe into a body of water. The experiments involved a wide range of initial parameters (e. g., height of the discharge pipe from the bottom, flow rate, and concentration of the fluid mud at the time of discharge). The discharged fluid mud descended as vertical buoyant jets and flowed away as axisymmetric underflows after impinging on the bottom. The underflows exhibited two well-documented propagation phases: (1) a radial momentum-driven wall jet phase near the impingement region, and (2) an inertial gravity current phase after the completion of the wall jet phase. Experiments revealed that, depending on the initial discharge parameters, underflows underwent a viscous propagation phase in which the propagations were influenced by the non-Newtonian rheology of the discharged fluid mud. The dynamics of the propagation phases of underflows were analyzed and compared with previous studies on saline underflows. The radial wall jet lengths (radial extent of underflows at which they transitioned from the wall jet phase to the inertial gravity current phase) were found to scale on the characteristic jet length scale and discharge source-bottom separation distance when the buoyant jets impinge on the bottom as momentum-dominated jets. When the buoyant jets impinge on the bottom as buoyancy-dominated plumes, however, they scaled with only the source-bottom separation distance. Radial wall jet length parameterizations for both types of the impingements were developed. The predictive capabilities of two different shallow water model solutions were tested for the inertial propagation of fluid mud gravity currents. The transitions of fluid mud underflows into a viscous propagation phase were analyzed in terms of the discharge parameters and their non-Newtonian rheology. A box model solution for the viscous propagation of axisymmetric non-Newtonian gravity currents was developed. Predictions of the developed box model were then evaluated using the authors' experimental observations. Of those underflows in which viscous propagation occurred, few showed an abrupt settling phenomenon after propagating some distance in the viscous propagation phase in which clay particles abruptly settled en masse from the underflows and only a turbidity cloud propagated. Discussions on the abrupt settling phenomena are also provided. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0733-9429	1943-7900		WOS:000349903500001		
J	Gibert, James M.; Batt, Gregory S.								Impact Oscillator Model for the Prediction of Dynamic Cushion Curves of Open Cell Foams								PACKAGING TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCE				28	3			227	239		10.1002/pts.2100			MAR 2015	2015	Cushion curves enable packaging designers to optimize a design solution for a given product fragility and expected distribution environment drop height. The industry accepted techniques for developing these curves are time intensive and devoid of a physical understanding of the materials and the physics involve in energy absorption. This paper delves into a qualitative understanding of the dynamics of a platen impacting an open cell foam cushion material. An hyperelastic material model is used to describe the foam's nonlinear stress-strain relationship, while its damping and hysteretic behaviour are represented with linear viscoelasticity. Using a simple nonlinear, discontinuous model of a drop test along with numerical simulations, the study examines the physics of the impact. The numerical studies show that the model is able to provide predictions of the shock pulse's shape, duration and amplitude at various static stresses and drop heights. The dynamic cushion curves generated by the model retain the characteristic concave upward 'trough' shape of the experimental curves. Furthermore, the model shows that the optimal amplitude of shock absorbed for a given set of drop conditions depends on the foam's thickness and cross-sectional area. Lastly, the model is validated using the comparison of a predicted curve and experimental data captured using a cushion tester.

Use of baseband phase structure to improve the performance of current speech enhancement algorithms								SPEECH COMMUNICATION				67				78	91		10.1016/j.specom.2014.11.003			MAR 2015	2015	In this study we propose a noise estimation technique based on spectral sparsity, detected by using the harmonic property of voiced segments of the speech. We estimate the frame to frame phase difference for clean speech, in the baseband Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) domain, from corrupted speech. This estimated frame-to-frame phase difference is used as a means of detecting the noise and harmonic dominant frequency bins in voiced frames. In the unvoiced frames noise is estimated using a Voice Activity Detector (VAD). Using this approach gives better noise estimation for the highly non-stationary noises like babble, restaurant and subway noise. The proposed noise estimation algorithm along with the phase difference as an additional prior is used to extend the standard spectral subtraction algorithm. Estimated baseband phase difference is used to prevent over-suppression of harmonic dominant speech in the voiced frames by adjusting the over-attenuation factor of the spectral subtraction algorithm. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed noise estimation technique when used with the log-Minimum Mean Squared Error Short Time Spectral Amplitude Estimator (log-MMSE STSA) speech enhancement algorithm. Finally, spectral subtraction and log-MMSE STSA are combined to achieve better noise suppression with minimum musical noise and speech distortion. This combination results in further improvement of speech quality. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0167-6393	1872-7182		WOS:000350090900007

Using nestling plasma to assess long-term spatial and temporal concentrations of organochlorine compounds in bald eagles within Voyageurs National Park, Minnesota, USA								CHEMOSPHERE				123				79	86		10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.12.043			MAR 2015	2015	The bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) population at Voyageurs National Park (VNP) provides an opportunity to assess long-term temporal and spatial trends of persistent environmental contaminants. Nestling bald eagle plasma samples collected from 1997 to 2010 were analyzed for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides. Trends of total PCBs, total DDTs, 4,4'-DDE, and Dieldrin were analyzed since >50% of nestling plasma samples had detectable concentrations. Total PCBs, total DDTs, and 4,4'-DDE concentrations have all decreased over time (26.09%, 24.09%, and 40.92% respectively). Concentrations of Dieldrin have increased by 50.25%. In this study, 61.1% of all nestlings sampled had detectable concentrations of Dieldrin from all time periods and all areas of VNP. Since Dieldrin is a banned pesticide in North America, the source of this increase is unknown. However, increases and fluctuations in Dieldrin concentration suggest contaminant levels in VNP may be linked to a new source or environmental process. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Powder samples were synthesized by solid state reactions at 1000 degrees C for 48 h, while well-formed hexagonal single crystals of the same were grown hydrothermally using 10 M K2CO3 at 560-650 degrees C. Infrared-to-visible upconversion by Er3+/Yb3+,Ho3+/Yb3+, or Tm3+/Yb3+ codoped-K3Y(VO4)(2) glaserite powder and single crystals was observed, and the upconversion spectral properties were studied as a function of different Er3+, Tm3+, Ho3+, and Yb3+ ion concentrations. The process is observed under 980 nm laser diode excitation and leads to strong green (552 nm) and red (659 nm) emission for Er3+/Yb3+, green (549 nm) and red (664 nm) emission for Ho3+/Yb3+, and blue (475 nm) and red (647 nm) emission for Tm3+/Yb3+. The main mechanism that allows for up-conversion is attributed the energy transfer among Yb3+ and the various Er3+/Ho3+/Tm3+ ions in excited states. These results illustrate the large potential of co-doped alkali double vanadates for photonic applications involving optoelectronics devices.

Efficient energy transfer from the vanadate group to the rare earth ion has been established by photoluminescence investigation. Ultraviolet excitation into the metal to ligand charge transfer band of the vanadate groups results in orange-red, blue and green emissions from Eu3+ (592 nm), Sm3+ (602 nm), Tm3+ (475 nm), Er3+ (553 nm), and Ho3+ (541-551 nm) dopant ions. The emission intensities of the lanthanide-doped K3Y(VO4)(2) powders were studied as a function of dopant ion concentrations. Over the concentration ranges studied, no emission quenching was observed for Eu3+ or Ho3+ dopants, while Er3+, Sm3+ and Tm3+ dopants did exhibit such effects for dopant ion concentrations greater than 5%, probably due to cross relaxation processes.

Arc length is a natural measure of the fluctuations in a data series and can be used to quantify volatility. The idea is that processes with larger sample arc lengths exhibit larger fluctuations and hence suggest greater volatility. Here, a Gaussian functional central limit theorem for sample arc lengths is proven under finite second moment conditions. With equally spaced observations, the theory is shown to apply when the first differences of the series obey many of the popular stationary time series models in today's literature, including autoregressive moving-average, generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic, and stochastic volatility model classes. A cumulative sum statistic is introduced to identify series regimes of differing volatilities. Our applications consider log prices of asset series. Specifically, the results are used to detect nonstationary periods of stock prices. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1524-1904	1526-4025		WOS:000352861400016

Drawing on the source attribution perspective and role theory, we hypothesize that WFC is positively associated with social undermining behaviour at a later point in time and this relationship is explained in part by diminished PO fit perceptions. Furthermore, we argue that female employees reporting high levels of WFC are more likely to engage in undermining behaviour relative to men when PO fit is considered as a mediating variable. Specifically, we assert that PO fit is depleted to a larger extent for female than for male workers and, subsequently, is associated with higher levels of undermining behaviour. In a sample of over 300 full-time working adults employed across a variety of occupations, we found support for each of our predictions. Implications for research and practice are addressed.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0963-1798	2044-8325		WOS:000353045400010

Remodeling of Tannic Acid Cross linked Collagen Type I Induces Apoptosis in ER+ Breast Cancer Cells								ANTICANCER RESEARCH				35	3			1285	1290					MAR 2015	2015	Background: The naturally-occurring phyto-chemical tannic acid (TA) has anticancer properties. We have demonstrated that estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer cells are more sensitive to effects of TA than triple-negative breast cancer cells and normal breast epithelial cells. In the present study, cells were grown on TA-crosslinked collagen beads. Growing cells remodel collagen and release TA, which affects attached cells. Materials and Methods: The ER+ breast cancer cell line MCF7 and the normal breast epithelial cell line MCF10A were grown on TA-crosslinked collagen beads in roller bottles. Concentrations of TA in conditioned media were determined. Induced apoptosis was imaged and quantified. Caspase gene expression was calculated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: Both cell lines attached and grew on TA-crosslinked collagen beads where they remodeled collagen and released TA into surrounding medium. Released TA induced caspase-mediated apoptosis. Conclusion: TA induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner, with ER+ MCF7 cells displaying more sensitivity to effects of TA.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0250-7005	1791-7530		WOS:000352462900008	25750276

Strong Communities for Children: Results of a multi-year community-based initiative to protect children from harm								CHILD ABUSE & NEGLECT				41		SI		79	96		10.1016/j.chiabu.2014.11.016			MAR 2015	2015	This article reports the evaluation results from Strong Communities for Children, a multi-year comprehensive community-based initiative to prevent child maltreatment and improve children's safety. The outcome study consisted of a survey of a random sample of caregivers of children under age 10 in the Strong Communities service area and a set of comparison communities matched at the block group level on demography. Survey data were collected in two waves 4 years apart. Data were collected on (a) perceptions of the neighborhood and neighbors (e.g., neighboring, collective efficacy), (b) perceptions of neighbors' parenting practices, (c) parental attitudes and beliefs (e.g., parental stress; parental efficacy), and (d) self-reported parenting practices. The survey data were supplemented by data on substantiated reported rates of child abuse and neglect per 1,000 children and ICD-9 coded child injuries suggesting child abuse and neglect per 1,000 children. Compared to the non-intervention sample across time, the Strong Communities samples showed significant changes in the expected direction for social support, collective efficacy, child safety in the home, observed parenting practices, parental stress, parental efficacy, self-reported parenting practices, rates of officially substantiated child maltreatment, and rates of ICD-9 coded child injuries suggesting child maltreatment. These promising results, obtained through multiple methods of evaluation, confirm that a community mobilization strategy can shift norms of parents' care for their children and neighbors' support for one another, so that young children are safer at home and in the community. Replications should be undertaken and evaluated in other communities under diverse auspices. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Community differences in the implementation of Strong Communities for Children								CHILD ABUSE & NEGLECT				41		SI		97	112		10.1016/j.chiabu.2014.07.010			MAR 2015	2015	In 1993, the U.S. Advisory Board on Child Abuse and Neglect recommended a neighborhood-based strategy to prevent child abuse and neglect. The Board further recommended the development of Prevent ion Zones to allow for testing of the effectiveness of community-wide child protection efforts in neighborhoods of differing population density, ethnic and cultural composition, and social and economic resources. Following the Board's recommendation, this article presents the results of a trial of the effectiveness of a neighborhood-based strategy in low- and high-resource communities. Using management, survey, and administrative data, the research showed that both community types experienced declines in founded cases of and injuries suggesting child maltreatment for children under age 5. Low-resource communities experienced greater levels of mobilization, as measured by community and institutional engagement, and a greater number of positive outcomes related to changes in the quality of life for families and community norms relative to child and family wellbeing. In particular, the low-resource communities experienced the largest increases in receiving help from neighbors, neighboring, perceived household safety for neighborhood children, and observed positive parenting. High-resource communities experienced greater increases in intermediate outcomes related to self-reported parenting practices. The findings suggest that, ultimately, community mobilization can occur and be an effective means of preventing child maltreatment across community types. It appears, however, that community mobilization may play a more significant role in low-resource communities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Huang, Yongxi; Li, Shengyin; Qian, Zhen Sean								Optimal Deployment of Alternative Fueling Stations on Transportation Networks Considering Deviation Paths								NETWORKS & SPATIAL ECONOMICS				15	1			183	204		10.1007/s11067-014-9275-1			MAR 2015	2015	The lack of sufficient public fueling stations for Alternative Fuel Vehicles (AFVs) has greatly hindered their adoption. In this paper, we describe a novel Alternative Fueling Station (AFS) location model by considering the behaviors of AFV users who are willing to deviate slightly from their most preferred routes to ensure that their AFVs with limited travel ranges can be refueled en route to their destinations. The model considers multiple deviation paths between each of the origin-destination (O-D) pairs. It relaxes the commonly adopted assumption that travelers only take a shortest path between any O-D pairs. The model provides the most cost-effective deployment strategy of siting AFSs that are needed on the network to satisfy AFV demand between all O-D pairs. We examine the model on two test networks, the Sioux Falls network and a 25-node network, and draw insights into the numerical tradeoffs between station deployment, vehicle ranges, and route deviations. The results show that deviation paths can greatly reduce the cost of establishing AFSs on networks without compromising user convenience much. In addition, an "elbow point" rule is used to identify the most cost-effective AFV travel range in terms of the total cost of building AFSs.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1566-113X	1572-9427		WOS:000352822400008		
J	Dey, Santanu S.; Gupte, Akshay								Analysis of MILP Techniques for the Pooling Problem								OPERATIONS RESEARCH				63	2			412	427		10.1287/opre.2015.1357			MAR-APR 2015	2015	The pq-relaxation for the pooling problem can be constructed by applying McCormick envelopes for each of the bilinear terms appearing in the so-called pq-formulation of the pooling problem. This relaxation can be strengthened by using piecewise-linear functions that over-and under-estimate each bilinear term. Although there is a significant amount of empirical evidence to show that such piecewise-linear relaxations, which can be written as mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs), yield good bounds for the pooling problem, to the best of our knowledge, no formal result regarding the quality of these relaxations is known. In this paper, we prove that the ratio of the upper bound obtained by solving piecewise-linear relaxations (objective function is maximization) to the optimal objective function value of the pooling problem is at most n, where n is the number of output nodes. Furthermore for any epsilon > 0 and for any piecewise-linear relaxation, there exists an instance where the ratio of the relaxation value to the optimal value is at least n - epsilon. This analysis naturally yields a polynomial-time n-approximation algorithm for the pooling problem. We also show that if there exists a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for the pooling problem with guarantee better than n(1-epsilon). for any epsilon > 0, then NP-complete problems have randomized polynomial-time algorithms. Finally, motivated by the approximation algorithm, we design a heuristic that involves solving an MILP-based restriction of the pooling problem. This heuristic is guaranteed to provide solutions within a factor of n. On large-scale test instances and in significantly lesser time, this heuristic provides solutions that are often orders of magnitude better than those given by commercial local and global optimization solvers.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0030-364X			WOS:000352821400013

We study congruence primes for the Ikeda lift of f. In particular, we consider a conjecture of Katsurada stating that primes dividing certain L-values of f are congruence primes for the Ikeda lift. Instead of focusing on a congruence to a single eigenform, we deduce a lower bound on the number of all congruences between the Ikeda lift of f and forms not lying in the space spanned by Ikeda lifts.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0030-8730			WOS:000352491000002		
J	Gray, John V.; Anand, Gopesh; Roth, Aleda V.					Gray, John/0000-0002-0212-5654			The Influence of ISO 9000 Certification on Process Compliance								PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT				24	3			369	382		10.1111/poms.12252			MAR 2015	2015	This article examines the influence of ISO 9000 certification on plant-level process compliance, which arguably is its first-order, targeted performance dimension. The empirical setting is the medical device manufacturing industry. Process compliance is measured through Food and Drug Administration inspections of manufacturing plants. We control for several observable factors that possibly affect process compliance by matching certified plants with non-certified plants. Using longitudinal data, we find plants that obtained certification in the earlier diffusion period (early-certified plants) tend to have significantly better process compliance than a matched, non-certified control group of plants. The compliance difference between early-certified plants and their matched control group is greater than the compliance difference between late-certified plants and their matched control group. We also find deterioration in process compliance over time after certification. Because we capture longitudinally the first-order effects of ISO 9000 on process compliance, this study provides a useful baseline for assessing causality in ISO 9000-performance linkages. Also, we explain, in part, the inconsistencies observed in related ISO 9000 literature examining the performance effects of certification. Further, this research offers managerial insights on the dynamics of certification and process compliance with time, and highlights the need for continued vigilance post certification.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1059-1478	1937-5956		WOS:000352543400014

Strategic Design Responsiveness: An Empirical Analysis of US Retail Store Networks								PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT				24	3			451	468		10.1111/poms.12241			MAR 2015	2015	This study uses a service operations management (SOM) strategy lens to investigate chain store retailers' strategic design responsiveness (SDR)-a term that captures the degree to which retailers dynamically coordinate investments in human and structural capital with the complexity of their service and product offerings. Labor force and physical capital are respectively used as proxies for investments in human capital and structural capital, whereas gross margins are proxies for product/service offering complexity. Consequently, SDR broadly reflects three salient complementary choices of SOM design strategy. We test the effects of "brick and mortar" chain store retailers' SDR on current and future firm performance using publically available panel data collected from Compustat and the University of Michigan American Customer Satisfaction Index databases for the period 1996-2011. We find that retailers that fail to keep pace with investments in both structural and human capital exhibit short-term financial benefits, but have worse ongoing operational performance. These findings corroborate the importance of managers strategically maintaining the complementarity of design-related choices for improving and maintaining business performance.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1059-1478	1937-5956		WOS:000352543400019

In such a formulation however, the model with best fidelity merely represents an optimum compromise between various forms of errors and uncertainties and thus, multiple calibrated models can be found to demonstrate comparable fidelity producing non-unique solutions. To alleviate this problem, the authors formulate model calibration as a multi-objective problem with two distinct objectives: fidelity and robustness. Herein, robustness is defined as the maximum allowable uncertainty in calibrating model parameters with which the model continues to yield acceptable agreement with measurements. The proposed approach is demonstrated through the calibration of a finite element model of a steel moment resisting frame.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1615-147X	1615-1488		WOS:000352705400008

The pET-28b (+) Apr was expressed in a high expression strain E. coli BL21. The amino acid sequence deduced from the DNA sequence analysis revealed a 98% identity to that of Bacillus licheniformis 2709. Sodium salt-Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was used to access the protein expression. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated a protein of Mr of 38.8 kDa. The medium components and condition of incubation were optimized for the growth state of a recombinant strain. The optimal composition of production medium was composed of glucose 8 g/L, peptone 8 g/L and salt solution 10 mL. The samples were incubated on a rotary shaker of 180 r/min at 37 degrees C for 24 h.

J	Thyparambil, Aby A.; Wei, Yang; Latour, Robert A.					Thyparambil, Aby/0000-0003-1760-1454			Experimental characterization of adsorbed protein orientation, conformation, and bioactivity								BIOINTERPHASES				10	1					019002	10.1116/1.4906485			MAR 2015	2015	Protein adsorption on material surfaces is a common phenomenon that is of critical importance in many biotechnological applications. The structure and function of adsorbed proteins are tightly interrelated and play a key role in the communication and interaction of the adsorbed proteins with the surrounding environment. Because the bioactive state of a protein on a surface is a function of the orientation, conformation, and accessibility of its bioactive site(s), the isolated determination of just one or two of these factors will typically not be sufficient to understand the structure-function relationships of the adsorbed layer. Rather a combination of methods is needed to address each of these factors in a synergistic manner to provide a complementary dataset to characterize and understand the bioactive state of adsorbed protein. Over the past several years, the authors have focused on the development of such a set of complementary methods to address this need. These methods include adsorbed-state circular dichroism spectropolarimetry to determine adsorption-induced changes in protein secondary structure, amino-acid labeling/mass spectrometry to assess adsorbed protein orientation and tertiary structure by monitoring adsorption-induced changes in residue solvent accessibility, and bioactivity assays to assess adsorption-induced changes in protein bioactivity. In this paper, the authors describe the methods that they have developed and/or adapted for each of these assays. The authors then provide an example of their application to characterize how adsorption-induced changes in protein structure influence the enzymatic activity of hen eggwhite lysozyme on fused silica glass, high density polyethylene, and poly(methyl-methacrylate) as a set of model systems.

Atypical Expanded-Spectrum Hemifacial Microsomia: A Case Report								CLEFT PALATE-CRANIOFACIAL JOURNAL				52	2			240	245		10.1597/13-210			MAR 2015	2015	Objective: To present the case report of a patient with expanded hemifacial microsomia (HFM) that illustrates the complex interactions of these embryogenic factors and to review current theories and mechanism regarding the etiopathogenesis of HFM.Design and Method: We present the case of an African American girl who was born at full term by cesarean section and transferred to our institution for systemic malformations. Her craniofacial findings include holoprosencephaly, cleft lip and palate, low set and posteriorly rotated ears, flat midfacial features, micrognathia, left HFM with grade 1 microtia, hypoplastic mandible, and a small preauricular pharyngeal arch remnant. Systemic anomalies included ectopic kidney, atrial-septal defect, bilateral hip dysplasia, bilateral humeroradial fusion, bilateral club feet, and bilateral low-set thumbs with the right side also being triphalangeal. Genetic evaluation did not identify a molecular diagnosis or other known syndrome.Conclusions: Although vasculogenic disruption of the stapedial artery during early fetal gestation has been implicated in the etiology of HFM, the grouping and bilateral findings seen in our patient argue against this relatively simple and localized phenomenon. Instead, such diverse and widespread anomalies in the setting of expanded spectrum HFM seem to support the theory of a disorder in blastogenesis as the cause of HFM.					15th Biennial Congress of the International-Society-of-Craniofacial-Surgery15th Biennial Congress of the International-Society-of-Craniofacial-Surgery	SEP 10-14, 2013SEP 10-14, 2013	Int Soc Craniofacial SurgInt Soc Craniofacial Surg	WYWY	0	0	0	0	0	0			1545-1569	1055-6656		WOS:000352143500019	24605928

EFFECT OF CONTROL ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT PERFORMANCE: A META-ANALYSIS								JOURNAL OF COMPUTER INFORMATION SYSTEMS				55	3			46	54					SPR 2015	2015	Control modes are critical for promoting information systems development (ISD) performance, however the relationship is elusive. Further, control is typically discussed in terms of the use of portfolios of control comprised of both formal (outcome and behavior) and informal (clan and self) mechanisms. Yet, the extent to which formal and informal controls individually relate to both performance and each other is still not fully established. This research utilizes meta-analysis to examine these relationships. The results indicate that control does enhance performance, although the strength of the relationship varies across types of control and different measures of performance. The results also show a significant relationship between formal and informal control modes, providing support for views of complementarities between modes within portfolios of control. It appears, however; that only clan control is positively associated with formal control. Building on these findings we suggest future directions for the study of control in ISD.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0887-4417	2380-2057		WOS:000352184100006		
J	Huang, Yongxi; Zhou, Yan								An optimization framework for workplace charging strategies								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES				52				144	155		10.1016/j.trc.2015.01.022			MAR 2015	2015	The workplace charging (WPC) has been recently recognized as the most important secondary charging point next to residential charging for plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). The current WPC practice is spontaneous and grants every PEV a designated charger, which may not be practical or economic when there are a large number of PEVs present at workplace. This study is the first research undertaken that develops an optimization framework for WPC strategies to satisfy all charging demand while explicitly addressing different eligible levels of charging technology and employees' demographic distributions. The optimization model is to minimize the lifetime cost of equipment, installations, and operations, and is formulated as an integer program. We demonstrate the applicability of the model using numerical examples based on national average data. The results indicate that the proposed optimization model can reduce the total cost of running a WPC system by up to 70% compared to the current practice. The WPC strategies are sensitive to the time windows and installation costs, and dominated by the PEV population size. The WPC has also been identified as an alternative sustainable transportation program to the public transit subsidy programs for both economic and environmental advantages. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A nationally representative Web-enabled panel survey of U.S. adults (n = 1,051) was conducted to collect information on consumers' awareness and knowledge of NoVs. Respondents who had heard of NoVs were asked 22 true-and-false questions on the transmission, prevention, and control of NoVs. Forty-seven percent of respondents reported awareness of NoVs, and 85% of respondents had heard of the terms "cruise ship virus," "the stomach bug," or "the stomach flu," which are commonly used to describe NoVs. Of those respondents who had previously heard of NoV or other terms used by consumers to describe NoV (n = 948), 36% correctly answered 11 or more of the 22 true-and-false questions, suggesting that consumers have limited knowledge on how to prevent and control NoV infection. Most consumers do not understand that the primary mode of transmission for NoV infection is fecal to oral, and many have the misperception that meat and poultry are sources of NoV infection. There is the need to educate consumers about how to prevent and control NoV infection. Although there is a proliferation of food safety education materials available, most focus on foodborne bacteria rather than viruses. The survey results will be used to revise existing consumer food safety educational materials to include information on NoV prevention and control.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0362-028X	1944-9097		WOS:000350531300001	25719870

Factors that influenced the development, implementation, and evaluation of the program provided to low-literacy women in Guatemala are explored.Design and SamplePromotora training was conducted with 15 Mayan women from a rural community in the highlands of Guatemala. Women were selected by leaders of the community to participate in the program.MeasuresQuantitative data were collected and analyzed to determine descriptive statistics and reliability coefficients for the pretests and posttests. A nonparametric Wilcoxon test for paired-samples was conducted. The qualitative data from the program evaluations were analyzed for themes.ResultsMean scores increased from 41.73 (SD=9.65) to 70.33 (SD=21.29) on the pretest and posttest. The Cronbach's alpha was 0.54 on the pretest with 0.65 on the posttest. The Wilcoxon test demonstrated a significant difference between the pretest and posttest scores (Z=3.040, p<.05).ConclusionsExtremely low-literacy levels played a major role in the ability of the women to successfully complete the requirements of the training program. The curriculum demonstrated effectiveness, but will benefit from replication with a larger sample.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0737-1209	1525-1446		WOS:000351690300011	25154975

Using a simple free radical polymerization process, we synthesized copolymer nanoparticles with controlled stimuli-responsive phase-separated gibbosities. The topography of the gibbous phase can be controlled by the copolymer composition and polymerization conditions. When pH-sensitive monomers were copolymerized onto surface bulges, pH changes resulted in localized gibbous phase dimensional changes. Facilitated by monomer diffusion into interfacial particle seed solution regions, localized polymerization near the surface is responsible for the formation of phase-separated gibbous topographies. This general approach may offer a number of possibilities for controllable design of ordered heterogeneous copolymer morphologies for a variety of applications.									8	0	0	0	0	8			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000351791800084	25695763

Present solutions such as roadway infrastructure modifications and vehicle safety systems have helped to mitigate some ROR events but remain limited in their approach. A complete solution must also directly address the primary factor contributing to ROR crashes, which is driver performance errors. In this paper, four vehicle safety control systems, based on sliding (SL) control, linear quadratic (LQ), state flow, and classical theories, were developed to autonomously recover a vehicle from ROR without driver intervention. The vehicle response was simulated for each controller under a variety of common road departure and return scenarios. The results showed that the LQ and SL control methodologies outperformed the other controllers in terms of overall stability. However, the LQ controller was the only design to safely recover the vehicle in all of the simulation conditions examined. On average, it performed the recovery almost 50% faster and with 40% less lateral error than the SL controller at the expense of higher yaw rates.									3	0	0	1	0	3			0018-9545	1939-9359		WOS:000351459600005

Importance of Riparian Forest Buffers in Conservation of Stream Biodiversity: Responses to Land Uses by Stream-Associated Salamanders across Two Southeastern Temperate Ecoregions								JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY				49	1			83	94		10.1670/14-003			MAR 2015	2015	Stream microhabitats are strongly influenced by adjacent terrestrial land use and other anthropogenic disturbances. Therefore, sensitive stream fauna can be highly imperiled. We investigated relative susceptibility of stream-associated salamanders to riparian land use by studying species-specific responses that influence community assembly. The Piedmont and Blue Ridge ecoregions of the southeastern United States have high aquatic biodiversity, centuries of land use, and increasingly extensive urbanization. We surveyed low-order streams in these regions for salamanders across four riparian land uses (forests, agricultural, residential, and urban) and assessed 15 habitat variables at each sampling site. We found that forested streams were more diverse compared to streams affected by riparian land uses. Our study showed two distinct assemblages of salamanders in response to riparian land use: forest-dependent, large-bodied, long-lived species sensitive to riparian land uses (disturbance avoiders) and cosmopolitan, small-bodied, short-lived species that are relatively resistant to impacts of riparian land uses (disturbance tolerants). These assemblages varied in composition between the ecoregions, with Blue Ridge harboring more land-use-intolerant species. Results indicated that multiple habitat features of the riparian zone (canopy cover, canopy height, leaf litter cover), and stream geomorphology (bank complexity, streambed heterogeneity, sedimentation) are dramatically altered by riparian land uses, and influence the assemblage structure of salamanders. Riparian buffers in both ecoregions are largely unprotected (70% in Blue Ridge, 96% in Piedmont) and are possibly threatened with anthropocentric land uses. Results suggested that conservation of stream salamander communities should be strengthened with protection and restoration of riparian forests, connectivity among riparian forests, and soil-conservation practices.									5	0	0	5	0	5			0022-1511	1937-2418		WOS:000351572100012

Components and properties of the microenvironment such as extracellular matrix, adhesion integrins, tissue architectures and tissue modulus regulate growth, differentiation and apoptosis of cells. These properties control cell fate through complex signals that are influenced either by interactions between neighbouring cells or by stimulated cell surface receptors. In this study, we established an in vitro engineered microenvironment: i.e., a tissue test system that combined heterocellular tumour spheroids, polymeric microcarriers and adipocytes, an abundant stromal cell type in breast tissue, to investigate the behaviour of breast cancer cells in response to different environmental stimuli in a more relevant 3D microenvironment. Results showed the engineered microenvironment influenced breast cancer cell proliferation, differentiation and migration through multi-cellular interactions and changes in microenvironmental stiffness and that stromal cells such as adipocytes play a critical role in the breast cancer process.

Forecasting the impacts of future development on water quantity and quality within the Reedy River Watershed								LAND USE POLICY				44				1	9		10.1016/j.landusepol.2014.11.016			MAR 2015	2015	This study was initiated to gain a better understanding of how patterns of development within Greenville, SC and its surrounding metro area would affect the Reedy River's water quantity and quality. Grenville County is located in the Upstate of South Carolina and serves as an economic hub for this region. Greenville is located on the 1-85 corridor halfway between Atlanta, GA and Charlotte, NC. A previously prepared watershed-scale model was modified to yield quantity and quality data that would result from projected growth in Greenville through year 2030 at three different growth scenarios.The major findings of the study showed water quality was degraded with higher nutrient loads and peak and average flows were consistently higher for sprawling as compared to compact development. As more land is developed in the sprawling scenario, the amount of stormwater increases while water quality decreases. At Boyd Millpond by 2030, for instance, change in peak flow and average flow percentages more than double for the sprawling scenario. Similar effects were also seen for both total phosphorus and total nitrogen levels. Results are similar by 2030 for the flow entering Lake Greenwood from the Reedy River Arm. At that location, change in peak and average flow percentages, and changes in total nitrogen and phosphorus percentages, more than double when comparing sprawling versus compact developments.While these results are based on the effects of predicted development along the Reedy River, in Greenville, SC, the overall implications of development on water quality applies to most any community faced with similar issues. These modeling results allow land use planners such as municipal boards to gain a better understanding of what impacts land use planning and zoning can have on a community as related to effects on water quality and quantity.

Hence, decision makers must regularly choose between either allocating resources for experimentation or further code development. The authors propose a decision-making framework to assist in resource allocation strictly from the perspective of predictive maturity and demonstrate the application of this framework on a nontrivial problem of predicting the plastic deformation of polycrystals.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1537-6494	1537-6532		WOS:000351694300004		
J	Ratnaweera, Dilru R.; Mahesha, Chaitra; Zumbrunnen, David A.; Perahia, Dvora								In Situ Self Assembly of Nanocomposites: Competition of Chaotic Advection and Interfacial Effects as Observed by X-Ray Diffreaction								NANOMATERIALS				5	1			351	365		10.3390/nano5010351			MAR 2015	2015	The effects of chaotic advection on the in situ assembly of a hierarchal nanocomposite of Poly Amide 6, (nylon 6 or PA6) and platelet shape nanoparticles (NPs) were studied. The assemblies were formed by chaotic advection, where melts of pristine PA6 and a mixture of PA6 with NPs were segregated into discrete layers and extruded into film in a continuous process. The process assembles the nanocomposite into alternating pristine-polymer and oriented NP/polymer layers. The structure of these hierarchal assemblies was probed by X-rays as a processing parameter, N, was varied. This parameter provides a measure of the extent of in situ structuring by chaotic advection. We found that all assemblies are semi-crystalline at room temperature. Increasing N impacts the ratio of alpha to gamma crystalline forms. The effects of the chaotic advection vary with the concentration of the NPs. For nanocomposites with lower NP concentrations the amount of the gamma crystalline form increased with N. However, at higher NP concentrations, interfacial effects of the NP play a significant role in determining the structure, where the NPs oriented along the melt flow direction and the polymer chains oriented perpendicular to the NP surfaces.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2079-4991			WOS:000352358800016

Saccharomyces cerevisiae live culture affects rapidly fermentable carbohydrates fermentation profile in precision-fed dairy heifers								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE				95	1			117	127		10.4141/CJAS-2014-104			MAR 2015	2015	The experimental objective was to determine the dose effect of live yeast culture (YC) on rumen fermentation profiles and microbial total cell concentrations in precision-fed dairy heifers exposed to different rapidly fermented carbohydrates diets. A split-plot design with starch level as the whole plot and YC dose as sub-plot was administered in a four-period (21 d) 4 x 4 Latin square balanced for carryover effects. Eight Holstein heifers were allocated to two starch treatments (28% starch: HS; 17% starch: LS) and to a sequence of YC doses (0, 10, 30, and 50 g d(-1)). Total volatile fatty acid concentration was not different among YC doses or starch level, but molar proportions of propionate, isobutyrate, and isovalerate were higher for HS than for LS. Mean ruminal ammonia concentration was increased in HS-fed heifers. Heifers fed HS had an increased number of viable, non-viable, and total fluid-associated bacteria, particle-associated bacteria, and total bacteria. Increasing YC dose linearly beyond 10 g d(-1) decreased viable and total fluid-associated bacteria. The effects of various YC doses on ruminal fermentation products, pH, and microbial total cell concentrations indicate diet dependency between source of readily available carbohydrates and YC addition in dairy heifers.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0008-3984	1918-1825		WOS:000350822200013		
J	Tung-Thompson, Grace; Gentry-Shields, Jennifer; Fraser, Angela; Jaykus, Lee-Ann								Persistence of Human Norovirus RT-qPCR Signals in Simulated Gastric Fluid								FOOD AND ENVIRONMENTAL VIROLOGY				7	1			32	40		10.1007/s12560-014-9170-4			MAR 2015	2015	Human noroviruses (HuNoV) are a leading cause of foodborne disease and are known to be environmentally persistent. Foods usually become contaminated by contact with fecal material, both on hands and on surfaces. Emerging evidence suggests that HuNoVs are also shed and potentially aerosolized during projectile vomiting, resulting in another source of contamination. The purpose of this study was to compare the persistence of HuNoV in vomitus-like material (simulated gastric fluid, SGF, pH 2.5) to that in a pH neutral buffer (phosphate buffered saline, PBS, pH 7.4) in suspension and on surfaces. Human fecal suspensions containing two HuNoV strains (GI.1 and GII.4) were suspended in SGF and PBS. Suspension and surface samples were held at room temperature, and subsamples were collected from both samples for a period up to 42 days. Subsamples were subjected to RNA isolation, with and without inclusion of an RNase pre-treatment, followed by RT-qPCR amplification. In suspension assays, the genome copy number of HuNoV GII.4 decreased by a parts per thousand currency sign1.0-1.3 log(10) over 42 days, irrespective of suspension buffer. On stainless steel, there was virtually no reduction in HuNoV GII.4 RT-qPCR signal over the 42-days experimental period, regardless of suspension buffer. Overall, the GI.1 RT-qPCR signal dropped more precipitously. In most cases, there were no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) between persistence in solution or on surfaces when comparing RT-qPCR assays with and without prior RNase treatment. This study suggests that HuNoV suspended in vomitus-like material can persist for long periods, a likely contributor to foodborne transmission.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1867-0334	1867-0342		WOS:000349400700005	25344785

Identification of bovine prolactin in seminal fluid, and expression and localization of the prolactin receptor and prolactin-inducible protein in the testis and epididymis of bulls exposed to ergot alkaloids								THERIOGENOLOGY				83	4			662	669		10.1016/j.theriogenology.2014.10.031			MAR 1 2015	2015	The objectives of this study were to determine (1) the presence and expression levels of bovine prolactin receptor (PRLR) and prolactin-inducible protein (PIP) in bovine testis and epididymis, and (2) the presence and concentrations of prolactin (PRL) present in seminiferous fluid in bulls consuming diets with (E+) or without (E-) ergot alkaloids. Bulls (n = 8) were sacrificed after 126 days (group A) of E+ or E- treatment or 60 days after all bulls (n = 6) were switched to the E- ration (group B). End point and real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry were conducted on testis and epididymis samples to establish the presence and relative expression of PRLR and PIP. Seminal fluid samples obtained from bulls consuming E- and E+ diets were subjected to RIA for PRL. Both PIP and PRLR were present in testis and epididymis as determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. Prolactin-inducible protein mRNA abundance was affected by time of slaughter in testis and epididymis head, respectively (P < 0.05). Prolactin receptor mRNA expression was affected by time of slaughter in the epididymis (P < 0.05) and differed in testis samples because of treatment (P < 0.05). Radioimmunoassay establishes the presence of PRL in seminal fluid; however, differences in the concentration of PRL over two separate studies were inconsistent, possibly because of differences in diet. The presence and localization of the PRLR are consistent with expression data reported for other species, and the presence of PIP and PRL in seminal fluid is consistent with data generated in humans.

We adopt a generalized singular -prior distribution for the unknown model parameters and the beta-prime prior for the scaling factor , which results in a closed-form expression of the marginal posterior distribution without integral representation. A special prior on the model space is then advocated to reflect and maintain the hierarchical or structural relationships among predictors. It is shown that under some nominal assumptions, the proposed approach is consistent in terms of model selection and prediction. Simulation studies show that our proposed approach has a good performance for structured variable selection in linear regression models. Finally, a real-data example is analyzed for illustrative purposes.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0943-4062	1613-9658		WOS:000351407000011

When the ligand L which cannot act as a hydrogen donor was used, in all three solvents the same product was obtained. This was a [Mn(SCN)(2)L-2](n) metalorganic framework, consisting of two-dimensional (2D) networks, each interpenetrating two neighboring ones. When the bridging ligands L have additional functional groups capable of acting as hydrogen donors or acceptors, synthesis from acetonitrile yields non-interpenetrating 2D [Mn(SCN)(2)L-2](n) networks with solvent molecules occupying the voids of the network. Other solvents were found to yield interpenetrated solvent free networks, or they replaced some of the L ligands, forming one-dimensional coordination polymers.									10	0	0	0	0	10			1528-7483	1528-7505		WOS:000350614400042

The latter included predicting the behaviors of natural products under acidic, basic, nucleophilic, and electrophilic reaction conditions and designing molecules based on a set of constraints. Content analysis of the data revealed that the students' conceptualized a substance's phase (of matter) at ambient temperature and pressure primarily on molecular size and intermolecular forces, but did not consider molecular shape or any thermodynamic factors. This oversight of molecular geometry also manifested itself in the students' conceptions of molecular polarity and solubility in water, both of which were based solely on the presence of heteroatoms. Furthermore, the students were unable to articulate their conceptions of chemical characteristics such as acidity/basicity and nucleophilicity/electrophilicity. In the application tasks, the participants experienced considerable difficulty with components requiring them to integrate multiple concepts. These results are interpreted in the context of lingering concerns that current chemistry/science instructional practices lead to students developing knowledge bases consisting of numerous isolated facts with relatively few connections between them. We conclude with some suggestions for helping students in undergraduate organic chemistry courses to develop more robust and integrative conceptual frameworks.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0021-9584	1938-1328		WOS:000351487500005

Media-Induced Elevation as a Means of Enhancing Feelings of Intergroup Connectedness								JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ISSUES				71	1			106	122		10.1111/josi.12099			MAR 2015	2015	The majority of research on media counter-stereotyping of race/ethnicity has tended to employ positive portrayals or counter-stereotypical exemplars as a primary strategy in eliciting positive attitudes among White participants. In contrast, this article reports the results of an experiment on the unique role of affective responses to media messages as a mechanism in inducing greater feelings of connectedness with a diversity of racial/ethnic groups. Our focus is on the affective response of elevation specifically, which refers to feelings of being moved, touched, and inspired by images of people engaged in morally beautiful acts such as love, generosity, and kindness. Results show that the experience of elevation in response to inspiring videos was associated with heightened feelings of overlap between the self and humanity, with this overlap associated with greater feelings of connectedness with those from a diversity of racial/ethnic groups. This connection was also associated with more favorable attitudes.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0022-4537	1540-4560		WOS:000351359000007

Prolonging life in chick forebrain-neuron culture and acquiring spontaneous spiking activity on a microelectrode array								BIOTECHNOLOGY LETTERS				37	3			499	509		10.1007/s10529-014-1704-1			MAR 2015	2015	Various types of animal neurons were cultured on a microelectrode array (MEA) platform to form biosensors to detect potential environmental neurotoxins. For a large-scale screening tool, rodent MEA-based cortical-neuron biosensors would be very costly but chick forebrain neurons (FBNs) are abundant, cost-effective, and easy to dissect. However, chick FBNs have a lifespan of similar to 14 days in vitro and their spontaneous spike activity (SSA) has been difficult to develop and detect. We used a high-density neuron-glia co-culture on an MEA to prolong chick FBN lifetime to 3 months with lifetime-long SSA. A remarkable embryonic age-dependency in the culture's morphology, lifespan, and most features of SSA signal was discovered. Our results show the feasibility of developing a chick FBN-MEA biosensor and also establish a new electrophysiological platform for functional study of an in vitro neuronal network.									3	1	0	1	0	3			0141-5492	1573-6776		WOS:000350394800003	25344105

In our laboratory, we have observed that N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) precursors leach from virgin membranes. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to examine (i) the potential leaching of NDMA precursors from different types of nanofiltration membranes and (ii) membrane cleaning techniques using different types of background solutions to prevent the leaching. The results showed that for three different types of nanofiltration membranes, leaching of high levels of NDMA precursors (similar to 180-450 ng/L) was observed Leaching continued even after membranes had been washed with similar to 3900 L of distilled deionized water/m(2). Among various cleaning techniques, washing the membrane with a 1 mg/L Cl-2 solution was found to be the most effective for reducing the extent of NDMA precursor leaching.									5	0	0	3	0	5			2328-8930			WOS:000351017300004		
J	Ginjupalli, Gautam K.; Gerard, Patrick D.; Baldwin, William S.								ARACHIDONIC ACID ENHANCES REPRODUCTION IN DAPHNIA MAGNA AND MITIGATES CHANGES IN SEX RATIOS INDUCED BY PYRIPROXYFEN								ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY				34	3			527	535		10.1002/etc.2804			MAR 2015	2015	Arachidonic acid is 1 of only 2 unsaturated fatty acids retained in the ovaries of crustaceans and an inhibitor of HR97g, a nuclear receptor expressed in adult ovaries. The authors hypothesized that, as a key fatty acid, arachidonic acid may be associated with reproduction and potentially environmental sex determination in Daphnia. Reproduction assays with arachidonic acid indicate that it alters female:male sex ratios by increasing female production. This reproductive effect only occurred during a restricted Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata diet. Next, the authors tested whether enriching a poorer algal diet (Chlorella vulgaris) with arachidonic acid enhances overall reproduction and sex ratios. Arachidonic acid enrichment of a C. vulgaris diet also enhances fecundity at 1.0 mu M and 4.0 mu M by 30% to 40% in the presence and absence of pyriproxyfen. This indicates that arachidonic acid is crucial in reproduction regardless of environmental sex determination. Furthermore, the data indicate that P. subcapitata may provide a threshold concentration of arachidonic acid needed for reproduction. Diet-switch experiments from P. subcapitata to C. vulgaris mitigate some, but not all, of arachidonic acid's effects when compared with a C. vulgaris-only diet, suggesting that some arachidonic acid provided by P. subcapitata is retained. In summary, arachidonic acid supplementation increases reproduction and represses pyriproxyfen-induced environmental sex determination in D. magna in restricted diets. A diet rich in arachidonic acid may provide protection from some reproductive toxicants such as the juvenile hormone agonist pyriproxyfen. Environ Toxicol Chem 2015;34:527-535.

Carbon nanotubes cause adverse effects themselves, and they have the potential to adsorb contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Although CNTs have a high adsorption capacity for PAHs and these contaminants can co-occur in the environment, few studies have characterized the bioavailability of CNT-adsorbed PAHs to fish. The goal of the present study was to characterize the bioavailability of fluoranthene adsorbed to suspended multiwalled-carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) in freshwater containing natural organic matter (NOM). Adsorption isotherms indicated that NOM influenced the adsorption of fluoranthene to MWNTs, although in the absence of MWNTs it did not influence the bioavailability of fluoranthene to Pimephales promelas. Pimephales promelas were exposed for 16h in synthetic moderately hard water containing fluoranthene in the presence of different concentrations of NOM, and fluoranthene adsorbed to MWNTs in the presence of NOM. Bioavailable fluoranthene was quantified in each exposure through bile analysis using fluorescence spectrophotometry. By comparing the concentration of fluoranthene metabolites in the bile with the concentration of fluoranthene added to MWNT and NOM solutions, the relative bioavailability of fluoranthene adsorbed to MWNTs was quantified. Results indicate that approximately 60% to 90% of the fluoranthene was adsorbed to the MWNTs and that adsorbed fluoranthene was not bioavailable to P. promelas. The results also suggest that fluoranthene is not desorbed from ingested MWNT, and the bioavailable fraction is only the freely dissolved fluoranthene in the aqueous phase.

A dynamic known target is displayed on a pixel grid, which is attached to one end of the kinematic chain of an XY theta (Z) stage; the latter represents the experimental testbed. At the other end of the kinematic chain, a digital monochrome camera is fixed to the bottom of the stage and provides 3D position information used as the feedback signal to the vision-based control system in charge of the tool's motion. The illuminated pixels on the display are captured in real time by the digital camera, and the stage motion control system attempts to keep the displayed image in the proper location with respect to the camera image plane. The result is a direct sensing multi-DOF position feedback system. The proposed camera-pixel grid sensing setup eliminates the reliance on the kinematic model and also avoids the need for traditional error compensation techniques, along with their associated cost and complexity. Positioning resolutions on the order of 1/100th of the pixel size on the display are achieved.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1861-8200	1861-8219		WOS:000350563300010

Analysis shows that, after release from rest, the slope of the particle trajectory adjusts from an initial slope of -Omega to a final slope of -root Omega where Omega is the inverse of the Tachikawa number. For Omega < 1 the trajectory steepens whereas for Omega > 1 the path becomes less steep over the full flight distance. However, for all values of Omega the trajectory initially steepens before adjusting to its steady trajectory slope. The final steady straight line trajectory is shown to project back to a virtual release height that is calculated numerically and shown to be a function of Omega. Approximate analytical solutions for the flight distance required to achieve the final steady-state slope (-root Omega) are presented and show that the transition height is a function of Omega for small values of Omega but is independent of Omega for larger values. The transition height is shown to be very large for a broad range of physically realistic conditions. Contour plots are presented that summarize the change in trajectory, horizontal flight distance, horizontal and vertical velocity, and kinetic energy as a function of vertical distance traveled and Omega.

J	Taylor, Brian D.; Morris, Eric A.								Public transportation objectives and rider demographics: are transit's priorities poor public policy?								TRANSPORTATION				42	2			347	367		10.1007/s11116-014-9547-0			MAR 2015	2015	Strong public and political support for mass transit in the U.S. is based on lofty goals, including congestion reduction, economic development, aesthetics, sustainability, and much more. Yet, as is the case in many areas of public policy, the pursuit of multiple and broad objectives, however worthy, can diffuse efforts and fail to achieve desired results. Moreover, these goals suggest a lack of focus on the needs of transit riders themselves, particularly the poor and transit dependent. We examine this by combining data from the National Household Travel Survey, the National Transit Database, the American Public Transportation Association, and a survey we conducted of 50 U.S. transit operators. First, we find that while rail transit riders in the aggregate are approximately as wealthy as private vehicle travelers, bus patrons have far lower incomes, and this disparity is growing over time. Second, few transit agencies publicly identify serving the poor or minorities as a goal, instead focusing on objectives that appeal to more affluent riders and voters as a whole. Finally, in recent decades transit spending priorities have been slanted away from bus service and towards commuter-oriented rail services favored by the wealthier general voting public, although most members of this group rarely if ever ride transit. We contend that efforts to secure popular support for transit subsidies stifle agencies' ability to acknowledge transit's critical social service function and serve the needs of its core demographic. While such strategies make sense politically, underserving the poor may be poor public policy.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0049-4488	1572-9435		WOS:000350578800007

LMX research is criticized for failing to consider the role of the social context in the development of subordinates' perceptions of LMX. We explore whether employees have similar LMX perceptions to those of multiplex social network ties.We conducted a social network study of 61 employees working in a computing and information technology company in the southeastern United States.Our results suggest that employees tend to have LMX perceptions similar to those of high-trust advice ties who work for the same supervisor and different from high-trust friendship ties who work for the same supervisor. Employees' LMX perceptions were unrelated to the LMX perceptions of high-trust friend and advice ties who worked for different supervisors.Our study contributes to research seeking to understand the role that the social context plays in shaping employees' LMX perceptions by demonstrating that social network ties are important to this process. It also contributes to research exploring social influence and social networks by offering a potential explanation for why friendship and advice ties are socially influential. From a practical perspective, our results will help managers to understand why employees' may have LMX perceptions which are inconsistent with the favorability of treatment that they receive.We respond to calls for research on the effects of context on organizational phenomena in general and LMX specifically.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0889-3268	1573-353X		WOS:000350327600008		
J	Woods, Carrie L.; Cardelus, Catherine L.; DeWalt, Saara J.								Microhabitat associations of vascular epiphytes in a wet tropical forest canopy								JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY				103	2			421	430		10.1111/1365-2745.12357			MAR 2015	2015	In tropical forests, vascular epiphyte diversity increases with tree size, which could result from an increase in area, time for colonization or an increase in microhabitat heterogeneity within-tree crowns if vascular epiphyte species are specialized to particular microhabitats within the crown. The importance of microhabitats in structuring epiphyte communities has been hypothesized for more than 120years but not yet confirmed. We tested the importance of microhabitats in structuring epiphyte communities by examining microhabitat heterogeneity and epiphyte communities within the crowns of different-sized Virola koschnyi (Myristicaceae) emergent trees in a Costa Rican tropical wet forest. We tested the degree to which epiphyte species composition was associated with environmental conditions and resources (i.e. microhabitats) using multivariate analyses and a null model that compared the observed epiphyte assemblages amongst different-sized trees and crown zones with assemblages generated randomly. This study is the first to rigorously examine the degree of microhabitat specialization in epiphyte communities. Microhabitat heterogeneity, epiphyte species richness and abundance increased with tree size. The largest trees had the highest microhabitat and epiphyte diversity and a unique inner crown microhabitat with canopy humus. The few epiphytes found on small trees were mostly bark ferns. Large trees had different epiphyte communities in different parts of the crown; the inner crown contained species not abundant in any other microhabitat (i.e. aroids, cyclanths and humus ferns), and the outer crown contained bark ferns and atmospheric bromeliads. Variation in species composition amongst tree size classes was significantly related to the mean daily maximum vapour pressure deficit and tree diameter, while variation within large tree crowns was significantly related to canopy humus cover. Microhabitat specialization of epiphyte species increased with tree size with 6% of species significantly associated with small trees and 57% significantly associated with large trees. Of the species present in large tree crowns, 23% were specialized to the unique inner crown microhabitat.Synthesis. The increase in microhabitat heterogeneity within tree crowns as trees grow contributes to changes in epiphyte community structure, which supports decades-old hypotheses of the importance of microhabitat diversity and specialization in structuring tropical epiphyte communities.									13	1	0	15	0	15			0022-0477	1365-2745		WOS:000350549000013		
J	Cao, Xiaoqing; Ayalew, Beshah								Estimation and predictive control of nonlinear diffusion processes with application to drying of coatings								PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART I-JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS AND CONTROL ENGINEERING				229	3			235	249		10.1177/0959651814559759			MAR 2015	2015	This article deals with the estimation and control of a class of distributed parameter processes dominated by nonlinear diffusion. The major challenges in control of such systems lie in the nonlinear infinite-dimensional nature of the systems and the lack of direct sensing for relevant system states. In the proposed scheme, the proper orthogonal decomposition-Galerkin method is adopted to derive a reduced-order model in terms of temporal coefficients from the original system described by nonlinear partial differential equation(s). To overcome the sensing problem, the unscented Kalman filter is implemented to estimate the temporal coefficients of the reduced-order model online and subsequently reconstruct the distributed system states. A set of improved sufficient conditions are also established to ensure stability of the estimation scheme. Then, once these difficulties are addressed, a nonlinear model predictive control scheme is formulated to achieve desired control objectives such as trajectory tracking for distributed states, energy optimization and quality control. The proposed estimation and control scheme is demonstrated via an application to infrared drying of coatings in the automotive industry.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0959-6518	2041-3041		WOS:000350239700004

Genetic evidence supports larval retention in the Western Caribbean for an invertebrate with high dispersal capability (Ophiothrix suensonii: Echinodermata, Ophiuroidea)								CORAL REEFS				34	1			313	325		10.1007/s00338-014-1237-z			MAR 2015	2015	The brittle star Ophiothrix suensonii is a common coral reef sponge commensal with high dispersal potential. Here, we utilize COI sequence data from 264 O. suensonii individuals collected from 10 locations throughout Florida and the Caribbean to investigate dispersal dynamics and demographic history. Locations separated by up to 1,700 km lacked genetic differentiation, confirming the ability for long-range dispersal. However, significant differentiation was detected among other regions. Samples from Utila, Honduras showed the greatest differentiation, suggesting that the circulation of the Mesoamerican gyre could be a significant factor restricting gene flow in this region. Demographic analyses provided strong evidence for a population expansion, possibly out of Florida, through the Caribbean, and into Honduras, which commenced in the early Pleistocene. However, the presence of a clade of rare haplotypes, which split much earlier (mid-Pliocene), indicates that O. suensonii persisted long before its recent expansion, suggesting a cyclic history of population contraction and expansion. Finally, patterns of gene flow are not concordant with contemporary surface currents; rather, they reflect historical movements possibly linked with changes in circulation during periods of Pleistocene climate change.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0722-4028	1432-0975		WOS:000350031100034

ASSESSING TEACHERS' SKILLS IN DETECTING AND IDENTIFYING EFFECTIVE INTERACTIONS IN THE CLASSROOM: Theory and Measurement								ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JOURNAL				115	3			407	432					MAR 2015	2015	Contemporary education reforms focus on assessing teachers' performance and developing selection mechanisms for hiring effective teachers. Tools that enable the prediction of teachers' classroom performance promote schools' ability to hire teachers more likely to be successful in the classroom. In addition, these assessment tools can be used for teacher training and preparation that contributes to improved student performance. This article summarizes the theoretical and empirical support for a direct assessment of teachers' skill in detecting and identifying effective classroom interactions the Video Assessment of Interaction and Learning (VAIL). Findings from a study of 270 preschool teachers suggest that the VAIL reliably measures teachers' interaction detection and identification skills. Teachers who can accurately detect effective interactions on video exemplars tend to have more years of education and display more effective interactions with the students in their classroom. Findings are discussed in terms of the implications for teacher selection, preparation, and training.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0013-5984	1554-8279		WOS:000350182500005

Here, we explored the potential of MFC-based electricity generation from forest detritus, a large untapped biomass pool. Electricity generation from in situ MFCs and relevant environmental parameters (i.e., carbon sources and concentrations, temperature, water depth) in a seasonally flooded freshwater cypress-tupelo wetland were monitored intensively for two flooding periods. Current outputs ranged from 0 to 1.27 mA (mean of 0.40 mA for flooding period) and were highly sensitive to environmental changes, showing seasonal and diel dependences. Excluding the influence of heavy storms, drought, or wetland icing, current output was highly temperature-dependent dielly. Seasonally, current output gradually increased in the first 3-4 months (limited by temperature) and decreased slightly during the last 1-2 months (probably limited by carbon and nutrients) of both flooding periods. Litter extract of baldcypress (Taxodium distictum) with lower C/N ratio and aromatic content showed greater stable current outputs (0.57 mA) based on 50 mg l(-1) biological oxygen demand compared to extracts of water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica) and longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), suggesting that the current output of in situ MFCs could depend on the vegetation within a wetland. Our study highlights the potential application of MFC in generating green and sustainable electricity from forest biomass for powering remote sensors in wetland ecosystems.									3	1	0	1	0	4			1757-1693	1757-1707		WOS:000349895300008		
J	Huang, Ying; Tang, Fujian; Liang, Xiao; Chen, Genda; Xiao, Hai; Azarmi, Fardad								Steel bar corrosion monitoring with long-period fiber grating sensors coated with nano iron/silica particles and polyurethane								STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL				14	2	SI		178	189		10.1177/1475921714560070			MAR 2015	2015	In this article, a recently proposed long-period fiber grating sensor coated with a thin layer of polyurethane and nano iron/silica particles is further developed and applied to monitor the corrosion process of deformed steel bars. Once calibrated, one coated long-period fiber grating sensor and one uncoated long-period fiber grating sensor for environmental compensation were attached to each of three steel bar samples that were tested in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution for 512h. The resonant wavelength in long-period fiber grating spectra increased exponentially with immersion time due to corrosion of iron particles and thus reduction in coating thickness. The mass loss rate of steel bar #1 at the completion of corrosion tests (512h of corrosion time) was correlated with that of sparse iron particles on long-period fiber grating sensor #1 after 130.5h of immersion. The corrosion rates of long-period fiber grating sensors #2 and #3 were evaluated at 130.5h and then used as a prediction of the corrosion rates of steel bars #2 and #3. The predicted corrosion rates by the long-period fiber grating sensors #2 and #3 were finally compared with those by potentiodynamic tests. The maximum mass loss prediction error by the long-period fiber grating sensors #2 and #3 is 26%. The coefficients of variation of three corrosion rate measurements are 0.049 by the long-period fiber grating sensors and 0.115 by the potentiodynamic tests, indicating more consistent and reliable measurements with the proposed technology.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1475-9217	1741-3168		WOS:000349980800006		
J	Lee, Ho-Joon; Sen, Atanu; Bae, Sooneon; Lee, Jeoung Soo; Webb, Ken								Poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate/hyaluronic acid semi-interpenetrating network compositions for 3-D cell spreading and migration								ACTA BIOMATERIALIA				14				43	52		10.1016/j.actbio.2014.12.007			MAR 1 2015	2015	To serve as artificial matrices for therapeutic cell transplantation, synthetic hydrogels must incorporate mechanisms enabling localized, cell-mediated degradation that allows cell spreading and migration. Previously, we have shown that hybrid semi-interpenetrating polymer networks (semi-IPNs) composed of hydrolytically degradable poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylates (PEGdA), acrylate-PEG-GRGDS and native hyaluronic acid (HA) support increased cell spreading relative to fully synthetic networks that is dependent on cellular hyaluronidase activity. This study systematically investigated the effects of PEGdA/HA semi-IPN network composition on 3-D spreading of encapsulated fibroblasts, the underlying changes in gel structure responsible for this activity, and the ability of optimized gel formulations to support long-term cell survival and migration. Fibroblast spreading exhibited a biphasic response to HA concentration, required a minimum HA molecular weight, decreased with increasing PEGdA concentration and was independent of hydrolytic degradation at early time points. Increased gel turbidity was observed in semi-IPNs, but not in copolymerized hydrogels containing methacrylated HA, which did not support cell spreading. This suggests that there is an underlying mechanism of polymerization-induced phase separation that results in HA-enriched defects within the network structure. PEGdA/HA semi-IPNs were also able to support cell spreading at relatively high levels of mechanical properties (similar to 10 kPa elastic modulus) compared to alternative hybrid hydrogels. In order to support long-term cellular remodeling, the degradation rate of the PEGdA component was optimized by preparing blends of three different PEGdA macromers with varying susceptibility to hydrolytic degradation. Optimized semi-IPN formulations supported long-term survival of encapsulated fibroblasts and sustained migration in a gel-within-gel encapsulation model. These results demonstrate that PEGdA/HA semi-IPNs provide dynamic microenvironments that can support 3-D cell survival, spreading and migration for a variety of cell therapy applications.

Protease-degradable PEG-maleimide coating with on-demand release of IL-1Ra to improve tissue response to neural electrodes								BIOMATERIALS				44				55	70		10.1016/j.biomaterials.2014.12.009			MAR 2015	2015	Neural electrodes are an important part of brain-machine interface devices that can restore functionality to patients with sensory and movement disorders. Chronically implanted neural electrodes induce an unfavorable tissue response which includes inflammation, scar formation, and neuronal cell death, eventually causing loss of electrode function. We developed a poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel coating for neural electrodes with non-fouling characteristics, incorporated an anti-inflammatory agent, and engineered a stimulus-responsive degradable portion for on-demand release of the anti-inflammatory agent in response to inflammatory stimuli. This coating reduces in vitro glial cell adhesion, cell spreading, and cytokine release compared to uncoated controls. We also analyzed the in vivo tissue response using immunohistochemistry and microarray qRT-PCR. Although no differences were observed among coated and uncoated electrodes for inflammatory cell markers, lower IgG penetration into the tissue around PEG+IL-1Ra coated electrodes indicates an improvement in blood-brain barrier integrity. Gene expression analysis showed higher expression of IL-6 and MMP-2 around PEG+IL-1Ra samples, as well as an increase in CNTF expression, an important marker for neuronal survival. Importantly, increased neuronal survival around coated electrodes compared to uncoated controls was observed. Collectively, these results indicate promising findings for an engineered coating to increase neuronal survival and improve tissue response around implanted neural electrodes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Effects of forage-to-concentrate ratio and dietary fiber manipulation on gas emissions and olfactometry from manure of Holstein heifers								JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE				98	3			1928	1937		10.3168/jds.2014-8633			MAR 2015	2015	The objective of this experiment was to determine the effects of differing ratios of forage to concentrate (F:C) and fiber levels on odor and gas emissions from manure. Eight Holstein dairy heifers (362.45 +/- 4.53 d of age and 335.6 +/- 7.41 kg of body weight) were randomly assigned to a split-plot, 4 x 4 Latin square design (21-d periods) with F:C as the whole plot (20 or 80% forage) and fiber level as sub-plot (0, 20, 40, or 60% inclusion of corn stover). Gas concentration was determined using an infrared photoacoustic analyzer over a 24-h period using a steady-state flux chamber setup. Odorous air samples were collected from chamber headspace and evaluated by 6 human assessors using a forcedchoice dynamic olfactometry technique. Emissions of CO2 were greater for the low than high concentrate diets, and no differences were observed for NH3 and CH4 emissions between F:C. Although F:C had no effect on NH3 emissions, as dietary fiber increased, a linear interaction with opposite effects was found for high and low concentrate diets. Nitrous oxide emissions were below minimum detectable levels. Neither F:C nor neutral detergent fiber level affected odor intensity. Odor emissions were successfully assessed, and manipulation of dietary fiber has the potential to influence CH4 and NH3 emissions.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-0302	1525-3198		WOS:000349584600049	25622867

But recent evidence has shown that the presence of uranium in phosphate fertilizers has caused massive amounts of this element to be released worldwide. Concerns are related to uranium movement to groundwater supplies and its significant toxicological risks to human populations. Information is direly needed on how geochemical processes control uranium transport in the vadose zone.Laboratory experiments were performed to investigate the effects of the pH of the soil solution on the reactive transport of uranium(VI) in the vadose zone. The uranium solution was prepared by dilution of a 10(-3) M stock solution of uranium perchlorate, (UO2(ClO4)(2)), with DI water. Two U(VI) solutions were prepared at concentrations of 2 x 10(-6) M at pH 6 and 11 and were percolated under steady-state conditions through columns filled with sand. The convective-dispersion equation (CDE) was used to analyze the tracer and uranium breakthrough curves resulting from the column experiments. The program CXTFIT was used to estimate the transport parameters of equilibrium and nonequilibrium (i.e., two-site and mobile-immobile) models applied to the experimental data.Comparison of U(VI) breakthrough behavior at pH 6 with that of a nonreactive tracer indicated that U(VI) transport was significantly retarded, and about 52 % of the added U(VI) adsorbed to the quartz sand, likely in the cationic forms UO2OH+ and UO (2) (2 +) . The adsorption was reversible upon the addition of deionized water. At pH 11, the U(VI) breakthrough curve increased gradually and reached a plateau value C/C (0) oscillating between 72 and 82 %. Upon reaction, Si was released from the dissolution of quartz sand, which allowed the possible transport of U(VI) following precipitation of a U(VI) containing solid, such as uranyl-silicate minerals, or sorption of U(VI) onto silica colloids. Two-site and mobile-immobile (MIM) models suggested an influence of either rate-limited mass transfer processes or immobile/mobile water partitioning in U(VI) reactive transport.The reactive transport of U(VI) governed by adsorption-desorption processes, precipitation, and complexation reactions in which kinetic behaviors are controlled by pH, solution chemistry, and heterogeneous flow regime impacts the mobility of U(VI). The column transport experiments indicated that under geochemical conditions and vadoze zone processes (preferential flow) that favor the mobility of U(VI), dissolved- and colloidal-phase associations of U(VI) may be transported rapidly and in high concentrations from the soil surface to the groundwater.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1439-0108	1614-7480		WOS:000349605100014

The ligand acts as a negatively charged tetradentate N3O-donor ligand and coordinates to the cadmium center in the enolic form (=N-N=C-O) in 1-3 and 5-6 while in compounds 4 and 7 coordinates as N-3- and N3O-donor neutral ligand in keto form (=N-NH-C=O), respectively. Cadmium centers in 1-4 and 6, bridging by the HPCIH ligand cause to form one-dimensional coordination polymers and the anions act as terminal ligands. In compounds 5 and 7, the N-3- and SCN- also act as bridging ligands to the metal centers, and form 3D and 2D metal-organic polymers respectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, our understanding of ISR's development and function remains incomplete, in part because the field's conceptualization and measurement of ISR vary greatly. A key sample case involves how Baltes and colleagues' Selection, Optimization, and Compensation (SOC) model of ISR, which was developed with adult populations, may be applied to understand and measure adolescent self-regulation. The tripartite structure of SOC identified in older populations has not been replicated in adolescent samples. This difference may be due to measurement issues. In this article, we addressed whether using a Likert-type format instead of a forced-choice format of the SOC Questionnaire resulted in a tripartite factor structure when used with an adolescent population. Using data from 578 late adolescents who participated in the 4-H Study of Positive Youth Development (70.80% female), we showed that the two versions of the measure produced a similar factor structure and were similar in terms of reliability and validity, although the traditional forced-choice version provided data with slightly lower criterion validity. We therefore conclude that both types of the measure are acceptable, but the choice of measure may depend on the sample in question and the analytical approach planned for the findings. We discuss the implications of our findings for future research.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0165-0254	1464-0651		WOS:000349318900009

Lentil also contains raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFO), resistant starch (RS), and other prebiotic compounds essential for maintenance of healthy gastrointestinal microflora. However, there is a lack of information about concentrations of prebiotics in commercially available, cooked, and processed lentil market classes. This study assessed concentrations of RFO and RS in two commercially available lentil market classes (medium green and small red) and determined changes associated with dehulling, cooking, cooling, and reheating. Mean total RFO concentrations ranged from 5.5 to 6.1% in raw lentils. Total RFO concentration decreased from raw to reheated seeds in two of the four lentil products: whole red (6.1-4.9%) and whole green (5.5-4.3%). Mean RS concentrations in raw, cooked, cooled, and reheated lentil (3.0, 3.0, 5.1, and 5.1% (dry weight), respectively) clearly demonstrate cooling-induced synthesis of RS from gelatinized starch.

J	Sanders, Lindsey; Stone, Roland; Webb, Kenneth; Mefford, Thompson; Nagatomi, Jiro								Mechanical characterization of a bifunctional Tetronic hydrogel adhesive for soft tissues								JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A				103	3			861	868		10.1002/jbm.a.35310			MAR 2015	2015	Although a number of tissue adhesives and sealants for surgical use are currently available, attaining a useful balance in high strength, high compliance, and low swelling has proven difficult. Recent studies have demonstrated that a four-arm poly(propylene oxide)-poly(ethylene oxide) block copolymer, Tetronic, can be chemically modified to form a hydrogel tissue adhesive (Cho et al., Acta Biomater 2012;8:2223-2232; Barrett et al., Adv Health Mater 2012;1-11; Balakrishnan, Evaluating mechanical performance of hydrogel-based adhesives for soft tissue applications. Clemson University, All Theses, Paper 1574: Tiger Prints; 2013). Building on the success of these studies, this study explored bifunctionalization of Tetronic with acrylates for chemical crosslinking of the hydrogel and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) for reaction with tissue amines. The adhesive bond strengths of various uni and bifunctional Tetronic blends (T1107 ACR: T1107 ACR/NHS) determined by lap shear testing ranged between 8 and 74 kPa, with the 75:25 (T1107 ACR: T1107 ACR/NHS) blend displaying the highest value. These results indicated that addition of NHS led to improvement of tissue bond strength over acrylation alone. Furthermore, ex vivo pressure tests using the rat bladder demonstrated that the bifunctional Tetronic adhesive exhibited high compliance and maintained pressures under hundreds of filling and emptying cycles. Together, the results of this study provided evidence that the bifunctional Tetronic adhesive with a proper blend ratio may be used to achieve an accurate balance in bulk and tissue bond strengths, as well as the compliance and durability for soft tissue such as the bladder.

J	Latour, Robert A.								The Langmuir isotherm: A commonly applied but misleading approach for the analysis of protein adsorption behavior								JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A				103	3			949	958		10.1002/jbm.a.35235			MAR 2015	2015	The Langmuir adsorption isotherm provides one of the simplest and most direct methods to quantify an adsorption process. Because isotherm data from protein adsorption studies often appear to be fit well by the Langmuir isotherm model, estimates of protein binding affinity have often been made from its use despite that fact that none of the conditions required for a Langmuir adsorption process may be satisfied for this type of application. The physical events that cause protein adsorption isotherms to often provide a Langmuir-shaped isotherm can be explained as being due to changes in adsorption-induced spreading, reorientation, clustering, and aggregation of the protein on a surface as a function of solution concentration in contrast to being due to a dynamic equilibrium adsorption process, which is required for Langmuir adsorption. Unless the requirements of the Langmuir adsorption process can be confirmed, fitting of the Langmuir model to protein adsorption isotherm data to obtain thermodynamic properties, such as the equilibrium constant for adsorption and adsorption free energy, may provide erroneous values that have little to do with the actual protein adsorption process, and should be avoided. In this article, a detailed analysis of the Langmuir isotherm model is presented along with a quantitative analysis of the level of error that can arise in derived parameters when the Langmuir isotherm is inappropriately applied to characterize a protein adsorption process.

Herein, the spatial variation of soil properties of the ground under the tunnel is explicitly considered. The validity of the FEM solution is verified by analytical solutions and model tests with various assumed scenarios. The random field theory is employed to model the spatial variation (in the longitudinal domain) of the subgrade reaction coefficient, which is a key soil parameter for FEM analysis of the longitudinal performance of shield tunnels. A hypothetical example is presented to demonstrate the capability of the simplified FEM procedure in analyzing the longitudinal performance of a shield tunnel with spatial soil variability. The results show that the overall settlement of the tunnel is mainly affected by the mean of soil properties, while the extent of the tunnel differential settlement is significantly affected by the variation and scale of fluctuation of soil properties.

J	Ni, Hui; Chen, Feng; Jiang, Ze Dong; Cai, Ming Ying; Yang, Yuan Fan; Xiao, An Feng; Cai, Hui Nong								Biotransformation of tea catechins using Aspergillus niger tannase prepared by solid state fermentation on tea byproduct								LWT-FOOD SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				60	2			1206	1213		10.1016/j.lwt.2014.09.010			MAR 2015	2015	A tannase that was prepared from Aspergillus niger by a solid-state fermentation on tea byproducts was investigated to transform the catechins in tea infusion. The tannase could effectively hydrolyze epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), gallocatechin gallate (GCG) and epicatechin gallate (ECG) of tea infusion, which showed pH values ranged from 4.8 to 53 during the tannase treatment. The enzyme was active and stable within pH 3.0-7.0 and 4-60 degrees C. The enzyme had K(m)s of 14.89 mmol/L, 16.13 mmol/L and 3.57 mmol/L for EGCG, GCG and ECG, respectively in pure solutions. However, the hydrolysis of individual EGCG, GCG and ECG in the tea infusion showed different kinetic parameters from those in pure solutions. The transformation of EGCG was the dominant reaction in tea infusion. After the tannase treatment, tea infusion was detected to have significant increases in the clarity and activities for scavenging 2, 2 '-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS) radical, 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) radical and hydroxyl radical. The results indicated the tannase was effective to transform the catechins, which could be possibly used for commercial extraction of catechins. In addition, the results suggested it is more desirable to follow the dynamic model to control the tannase treatment of tea infusion for a better processing. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The accelerated solvent extraction followed by solvent assisted flavor evaporation (ASE-SAFE) was used to extract the volatiles from Dezhou braised chicken. The extract was analyzed by a comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography/high resolution-time of flight mass spectrometry (GC x GC/HR-TOFMS) and a GC-qMS. Ninety one compounds were identified by GC x GC/HR-TOFMS with an aid of the NIST08 library and accurate mass determination, 44 compounds were identified by GC-qMS only with the NIST08 library. The main odor-active constitutes of the Dezhou braised chicken were carbonyl compounds (33.04%). 2-Enals and 2,4-dineals were considered to be the most important odor-active constitutes in chicken. In our study, 6 very polar and unstable 2-enals or 2,4-dineals compounds, including (E)-2-hexenal, (E)-2-nonenal, (Z)-2-decenal, (E)-2-undecenal, (E,E)-2,4-heptadienal and (E,E)-2,4-nonadienal, were only identified by GC x GC/HR-TOFMS. Three very polar and unstable furanones, including 5-acetyldihydro-2(3H)-furanone (0.04%), dihydro-3-hydroxy-4,4-dimethy1-2(3H)-furanone (0.32%) and 2,5-dimethy1-4-hydroxy-3(2H)-furanone (0.32%) were also only detected by the GC x GC/HR-TOFMS. Some trace sulfur-containing and nitrogen-containing compounds, including disulfide dipropyl (0.05%), 2-acetylthiazole (0.06%), 2-pyrrolidinone (0.15%) and benzothiazole (0.07%) that might play important roles in the flavor of chicken, were also only found by the GC x GC/HR-TOFMS.

J	Wang, Naichen; Wang, Lianming; McMahan, Christopher S.								Regression analysis of bivariate current status data under the Gamma-frailty proportional hazards model using the EM algorithm								COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS				83				140	150		10.1016/j.csda.2014.10.013			MAR 2015	2015	The Gamma-frailty proportional hazards (PH) model is commonly used to analyze correlated survival data. Despite this model's popularity, the analysis of correlated current status data under the Gamma-frailty PH model can prove to be challenging using traditional techniques. Consequently, in this paper we develop a novel expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm under the Gamma-frailty PH model to study bivariate current status data. Our method uses a monotone spline representation to approximate the unknown conditional cumulative baseline hazard functions. Proceeding in this fashion leads to the estimation of a finite number of parameters while simultaneously allowing for modeling flexibility. The derivation of the proposed EM algorithm relies on a three-stage data augmentation involving Poisson latent variables. The resulting algorithm is easy to implement, robust to initialization, and enjoys quick convergence. Simulation results suggest that the proposed method works well and is robust to the misspeciflcation of the frailty distribution. Our methodology is used to analyze chlamydia and gonorrhea data collected by the Nebraska Public Health Laboratory as a part of the Infertility Prevention Project. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Wines Using Strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with Odor Activity Values and Partial Least-Squares Regression								JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY				63	7			1939	1947		10.1021/jf505666y			FEB 25 2015	2015	The study evaluated the effects of five different strains (GRE, RC212, Lalvin D254, CGMCC2.4, and CGMCC2.23) of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae on the aromatic characteristics of fermented durian musts. In this work, 38 and 43 compounds in durian juices and wines were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and GC-pulsed flame photometric detection (GC-PFPD) with the aid of stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE), respectively. According to the measured odor activity values (OAV), only 11 and 15 aroma compounds had OAVs >1 in durian juices or wines, among which 2,3-butanedione, 3-methylbutanol, dimethyl sulfide, dimethyl disulfide, methyl ethyl disulfide, ethyl 2-methylbutanoate, ethyl butanoate, and ethyl octanoate were major contributors to the aroma of juices and wines. Partial least-squares regression (PLSR) was used to detect positive correlations between sensory analysis and aroma compounds. The results showed that the attributes were closely related to aroma compounds.									6	2	0	6	0	8			0021-8561	1520-5118		WOS:000350193400006	25620380

Morphology of the male genitalia is similar to that found in Heissophila Schuh from Thailand and therefore the traumatic insemination as found in other members of the family is hypothesized to be absent in Monteithophila. The female of an apparently congeneric taxon from Fiji is described as Monteithophila fijiensis. Paraplokiophiloides schwendingeri, new genus and new species, is described from Thailand. Female genitalic morphology in the Plokiophilidae is documented with laser confocal microscopy. A revised classification of the Plokiophilidae is proposed in order to establish congruence between observed morphological characters and the recognized higher-taxonomic groupings. The new subfamily Heissophilinae is erected to include Heissophila, Moneithophila, and the Baltic amber fossil Pavlostysia Popov. The concept of Plokiophilinae is revised to include all taxa with traumatic insemination. The tribe Lipokophilini is erected to contain the Recent genus Lipokophila Stys. A newly delimited Plokiophilini includes the subtribes Embiophilina and Plolciophilina; Paraplokiophiloides is placed in the Embiophilina based on the presence of fore- and mesofemoral spines. Defining characters of the Plokiophilidae are discussed and a key to the genera is included.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0003-0082	1937-352X		WOS:000350090700001

Double deprotonation followed by metallation of [1H(2)][Br] with Ag2O produced the Ag-NHC complex [Ag(1)](n) (2), which exhibited good solubility in organic solvents despite its multinuclear nature. Crystallographic analysis of 2 revealed a dodecametallic structure (n = 12) comprising mononuclear [Ag(1)] and dinuclear [Ag-2(1)(2)] subunits, the latter of which featured close Ag center dot center dot center dot Ag contacts. Transmetallation of 1 from Ag to Ru via the reaction of [RuCl(eta(6)-cymene)(mu-Cl)](2) with 2 afforded the Ru-NHC complex [RuCl(1)(eta(6)-cymene)] (3), which demonstrated catalytic activity for transfer hydrogenation of C=O, C=N and C=C bonds using isopropanol as the H-2 source.

The EGB comprises the.-ray emission from resolved and unresolved extragalactic sources, such as blazars, star-forming galaxies, and radio galaxies, as well as radiation from truly diffuse processes. This Letter focuses on the blazar source class, the most numerous detected population, and presents an updated luminosity function and spectral energy distribution model consistent with the blazar observations performed by the Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT). We show that blazars account for 50(-11)(+12)% of the EGB photons (>0.1 GeV), and that Fermi-LAT has already resolved similar to 70% of this contribution. Blazars, and in particular hard-spectrum sources such as BL Lacs, are responsible for most of the EGB emission above 100 GeV. We find that the extragalactic background light, which attenuates blazars' high-energy emission, is responsible for the high-energy cutoff observed in the EGB spectrum. Finally, we show that blazars, star-forming galaxies, and radio galaxies can naturally account for the amplitude and spectral shape of the background in the 0.1-820 GeV range, leaving only modest room for other contributions. This allows us to set competitive constraints on the dark matter annihilation cross section.									46	0	0	0	0	46			2041-8205	2041-8213		WOS:000349692900008

However, prioritization methods are impeded by insufficient knowledge on the distribution and conservation status of freshwater taxa, particularly invertebrates. We evaluated the extinction risk of the world's 590 freshwater crayfish species using the IUCN Categories and Criteria and found 32% of all species are threatened with extinction. The level of extinction risk differed between families, with proportionally more threatened species in the Parastacidae and Astacidae than in the Cambaridae. Four described species were Extinct and 21% were assessed as Data Deficient. There was geographical variation in the dominant threats affecting the main centres of crayfish diversity. The majority of threatened US and Mexican species face threats associated with urban development, pollution, damming and water management. Conversely, the majority of Australian threatened species are affected by climate change, harvesting, agriculture and invasive species. Only a small proportion of crayfish are found within the boundaries of protected areas, suggesting that alternative means of long-term protection will be required. Our study highlights many of the significant challenges yet to come for freshwater biodiversity unless conservation planning shifts from a reactive to proactive approach.									19	0	0	20	0	20			0962-8436	1471-2970		WOS:000347312400017	25561679

Behavioral response to habitat loss in juvenile spiny lobsters								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				521				117	128		10.3354/meps11125			FEB 17 2015	2015	Understanding behavioral changes is important when examining the impacts of rapid environmental change, particularly when critical resources such as protective shelters become locally limited during habitat loss events. In portions of Florida Bay (Florida, USA), cyanobacterial blooms have reduced the availability of large sponges, an important shelter for juvenile Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus. We examined whether juvenile lobsters from regions with and without sponge shelters differed in: (1) aggressive and gregarious behaviors; (2) den use, den sharing, and den fidelity before and after shelter loss; and (3) dispersal from sites with and without artificial shelters. In laboratory experiments where individuals were paired with similar-size conspecifics, habitat type had no influence on aggression and gregariousness, but larger lobsters were more aggressive and shared dens less frequently than smaller lobsters. When these same individuals were placed into groups of 20 in a mesocosm and exposed to shelter loss, individuals from habitats with sponges showed a greater decrease in den use and den sharing than individuals from habitats without sponges. After shelter loss, large lobsters decreased their den use, den sharing, and den fidelity more than small lobsters. When individuals were released at their point of capture in Florida Bay, large individuals were resighted less often than small individuals. This study suggests that lobsters from habitats without sponges may respond differently to future shelter loss and that size plays an important role in determining whether juvenile spiny lobsters share shelters or disperse.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0171-8630	1616-1599		WOS:000349996200009

Damage from unintentional metal-metal articulation of CoCrMo, TiAlV, and oxidized zirconium knee replacements following polyethylene insert failure								WEAR				324				1	9		10.1016/j.wear.2014.11.007			FEB 15 2015	2015	A small percentage of knee replacements with metal-backed tibial components experience complete polyethylene insert destruction or wear-through during in vivo service, resulting in unintentional articulation of the metal femoral bearing and tibial baseplate. Seven such explanted knee replacement sets were studied to determine the failure events that affected four combinations of unintentionally articulating metals, including both conventional CoCrMo and TiAlV, as well as surface modified oxidized zirconium (OxZr). The surface modified metal experienced local fracture at the surface when in contact with TiAlV and subsequent metal-metal wear of the substrate metal. All unintentional conventional metal-metal couples (CoCrMo-CoCrMo, TiAlV-TiAlV, CoCrMo-TiAlV, and ZrNb (substrate)-TiAlV) experienced adhesive wear processes resulting in material transfer. In mixed-metal pairs, the softer metal transferred to the harder metal (TiAlV transferred to CoCrMo and ZrNb transferred to TiAlV) during adhesion, resulting in gross dimensional change in the softer metal and roughening of the harder metal. While surface modified metals may be advantageous when articulating against polyethylene, in cases of polyethylene insert wear-through, both conventional and surface modified metals result in significant wear damage. The types of wear damage present and the extent of roughening varied across material combinations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The intra-species protein phosphorylation challenge organized by the IMPROVER consortium provided the framework to identify the best approaches to address this issue.Results: Rat lung epithelial cells were treated with 52 stimuli, and gene expression and phosphorylation levels were measured. Competing teams used gene expression data from 26 stimuli to develop protein phosphorylation prediction models and were ranked based on prediction performance for the remaining 26 stimuli. Three teams were tied in first place in this challenge achieving a balanced accuracy of about 70%, indicating that gene expression is only moderately predictive of protein phosphorylation. In spite of the similar performance, the approaches used by these three teams, described in detail in this article, were different, with the average number of predictor genes per phosphoprotein used by the teams ranging from 3 to 124. However, a significant overlap of gene signatures between teams was observed for the majority of the proteins considered, while Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were enriched in the union of the predictor genes of the three teams for multiple proteins.									0	1	0	0	0	1			1367-4803	1460-2059		WOS:000350059600003	25061067

It has now been realized that conditions in geospace are linked strongly to terrestrial weather and climate below, contradicting previous textbook knowledge that the space weather of Earth's near space environment is driven by energy injections at high latitudes connected with magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling and solar radiation variation at extreme ultraviolet wavelengths alone. The primary mechanism through which energy and momentum are transferred from the lower atmosphere is through the generation, propagation, and dissipation of atmospheric waves over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales including electrodynamic coupling through dynamo processes and plasma bubble seeding. The main task of Task Group 4 of SCOSTEP's CAWSES-II program, 2009 to 2013, was to study the geospace response to waves generated by meteorological events, their interaction with the mean flow, and their impact on the ionosphere and their relation to competing thermospheric disturbances generated by energy inputs from above, such as auroral processes at high latitudes. This paper reviews the progress made during the CAWSES-II time period, emphasizing the role of gravity waves, planetary waves and tides, and their ionospheric impacts. Specific campaign contributions from Task Group 4 are highlighted, and future research directions are discussed.									8	0	0	0	0	8			2197-4284			WOS:000363941900001

In contrast, synthetic hydrogels such as poly (ethylene glycol) allow tuning of mechanical properties, but do not elicit protein adsorption or cell adhesion. For this reason, we explored the use of composite hydrogel blends composed of Tetronic (BASF) 1107-acrylate (T1107A) in combination with extracellular matrix moieties collagen and hyaluronic acid seeded with bladder smooth muscle cells (BSMC). This composite hydrogel supported BSMC growth and distribution throughout the construct. When compared to the control (acellular) hydrogels, mechanical properties (peak stress, peak strain, and elastic modulus) of the cellular hydrogels were significantly greater. When compared to the 7-day time point after BSMC seeding, results of mechanical testing at the 14-day time point indicated a significant increase in both ultimate tensile stress (4.1-11.6kPa) and elastic modulus (11.8-42.7kPa) in cellular hydrogels. The time-dependent improvement in stiffness and strength of the cellular constructs can be attributed to the continuous collagen deposition and reconstruction by BSMC seeded in the matrix. The composite hydrogel provided a biocompatible scaffold for BSMC to thrive and strengthen the matrix; further, this trend could lead to strengthening the construct to match the mechanical properties of the bladder.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0920-5063	1568-5624		WOS:000347155600004	25495917

The methods considered include Gaussian likelihood ratio tests for variance equality, a chi-squared time-domain test, and a spectral-based test. The latter two tests assess equality of the multivariate autocovariance function of the two signals over many different lags. The Gaussian likelihood ratio test is perhaps best viewed as principal component analyses (PCA) without dimension reduction aspects; it can be modified to consider covariance features other than variances via dimension augmentation tactics. A simulation study is constructed that shows how one can make inappropriate conclusions with PCA tests, even when dimension augmentation techniques are used to incorporate non-zero lag autocovariances into the analysis. The various discrimination methods are first discussed. A simulation study then illuminates the various properties of the methods. In this pursuit, calculations are needed to identify several multivariate time series models with specific autocovariance properties. To demonstrate the applicability of the methods, nine US and Canadian weather stations from three distinct regions are clustered. Here, the spectral clustering perfectly identified distinct regions, the chi-squared test performed marginally, and the PCA/likelihood ratio method did not perform well.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0094-9655	1563-5163		WOS:000344408800004

In both dispersive and dissipative optomechanical systems, a positive feedback is formed between the optical resonance frequency and the mechanical displacement, which results in nonlinear transmission spectra different from a Lorentzian profile. Given the same resonator design, the optomechanical nonlinearity can increase the overall sensitivity by at least two orders of magnitude. Further improvement is possible by employing the phase sensitive detection. For the stable operation of the proposed sensor, we also analyze the requirement on the input power and the optomechanical coupling rate to overcome the thermal-optically induced frequency shift.

This improvement was originated from the simultaneous enhancement in the thermoelectric power factor and reduction in thermal conductivity, which was contributed to the non-uniform distribution of Pr dopants. In order to further understand the underlying mechanism, we herein investigate the role of praseodymium doping source (Pr2O3 versus Pr6O11) on the synthesis and electronic transport in Pr-doped SrTiO3 ceramics. It was observed that the high-temperature electronic transport properties are independent of the choice of praseodymium doping source for samples prepared following our synthesis strategy. Theoretical calculations were also performed in order to estimate the maximum achievable power factor and the corresponding optimal carrier concentration. The result suggests the possibility of further improvement of the power factor. This study should shed some light on the superior electronic transport in bulk polycrystalline Pr-doped SrTiO3 ceramics and provide new insight on further improvement of the thermoelectric power factor.

J	Wells, Christina E.; Vendramin, Elisa; Tarodo, Sergio Jimenez; Verde, Ignazio; Bielenberg, Douglas G.								A genome-wide analysis of MADS-box genes in peach [Prunus persica (L.) Batsch]								BMC PLANT BIOLOGY				15						41	10.1186/s12870-015-0436-2			FEB 7 2015	2015	Background: MADS-box genes encode a family of eukaryotic transcription factors distinguished by the presence of a highly-conserved similar to 58 amino acid DNA-binding and dimerization domain (the MADS-box). The central role played by MADS-box genes in peach endodormancy regulation led us to examine this large gene family in more detail. We identified the locations and sequences of 79 MADS-box genes in peach, separated them into established subfamilies, and broadly surveyed their tissue-specific and dormancy-induced expression patterns using next-generation sequencing. We then focused on the dormancy-related SVP/AGL24 and FLC subfamilies, comparing their numbers and phylogenetic relationships with those of other sequenced woody perennial genomes.Results: We identified 79 MADS-box genes distributed across all eight peach chromosomes and frequently located in clusters of two or more genes. They encode proteins with a mean length of 248 +/- 72 amino acids and include representatives from most of the thirteen Type II (MIKC) subfamilies, as well as members of the Type I M alpha, M beta, and M. subfamilies. Most Type I genes were present in species-specific monophyletic lineages, and their expression in the peach sporophyte was low or absent. Most Type II genes had Arabidopsis orthologs and were expressed at much higher levels throughout vegetative and fruit tissues. During short-day-induced growth cessation, seven Type II genes from the SVP/AGL24, AGL17, and SEP subfamilies showed significant changes in expression. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that multiple, independent expansions have taken place within the SVP/AGL24 and FLC lineages in woody perennial species.Conclusions: Most Type I genes appear to have arisen through tandem duplications after the divergence of the Arabidopsis and peach lineages, whereas Type II genes appear to have increased following whole genome duplication events. An exception to the latter rule occurs in the FLC and SVP/AGL24 Type II subfamilies, in which species-specific tandem duplicates have been retained in a number of perennial species. These subfamilies comprise part of a genetic toolkit that regulates endodormancy transitions, but phylogenetic and expression data suggest that individual orthologs may not function identically across all species.									13	1	0	12	0	14			1471-2229			WOS:000349410600001	25848674

This technique is a very low energy process, forming effective welds in less than a second particularly for difficult dissimilar material combinations such as aluminium to steel joint. However, in dissimilar joint the interdiffusion and thus intermetallic formation was accelerated due to high strain rate dynamic deformation in ultrasonic spot welding which deteriorates mechanical performance. The interfacial reaction between aluminium 6111-T4 and DC04 uncoated steel has been investigated as a function of welding time. For the optimum welding time of 1.5 s under a 1.4 kN axial pressure, the intermetallic layer thickness could have reached similar to 1.0 mu m. Intermetallic islands were seen to nucleate across the microbonds at the interface within short welding times which spread and grow rapidly forming a continuous layer which mainly contains FeAl3 and Fe2Al5 phases. The interfacial reaction occurred in solid state even for a long welding time. Modelling was carried out with the aim of showing that the rate of interfacial reaction was over 6 times greater than the rate observed in diffusion couple using rate constants achieved from the static heat treatment condition. This confirms that deformation- induced vacancies during the thermomechanical welding process accelerates formation of intermetallic layer at the interface. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The inhibition by insulin is experimentally known, but the role of Zn2+ is controversial as both correlations and anti-correlations at the population level are observed between T2D risk and the activity of a beta-cell specific zinc ion transporter, ZnT8. Since Zn2+ concentration determines insulin oligomer equilibrium, we computationally investigated interactions of IAPP with different insulin oligomers and compared with IAPP homodimer formation. We found that IAPP binding with insulin oligomers competes with the formation of both higher-molecular-weight insulin oligomers and IAPP homodimers. Therefore, zinc deficiency due to loss-of-function ZnT8 mutations shifts insulin oligomer equilibrium toward zinc-free monomers and dimers, which bind IAPP monomers more efficiently compared to zinc-bound hexamers. The hetero-molecular complex formation prevents IAPP from self-association and subsequent aggregation, reducing T2D risk.									7	0	1	4	0	8			2045-2322			WOS:000348768100012	25649462

Hydrothermal Growth of Lanthanide Borosilicates: A Useful Approach to New Acentric Crystals Including a Derivative of Cappelenite								INORGANIC CHEMISTRY				54	3			905	913		10.1021/ic502279n			FEB 2 2015	2015	The reaction of barium borosilicate glasses in hydrothermal fluids with NaOH mineralizer at ca. 600-650 degrees C in the presence of various sources of Eu3+ ions leads to a new series of noncentrosymmetric single crystals characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Under three slightly different reaction modifications, three new Eu3+-containing noncentrosymmetric single crystals were isolated and characterized. Using a barium borosolicate glass with Eu2O3 added to the reaction mixture led to NaBaEuSi3O9 (1), which crystallizes in the noncentrosymmetric orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) with unit cell parameters a = 5.6373(11) angstrom, b = 11.483(2) angstrom, and c = 12.535(2) angstrom and consists of Eu3+ ions linked by Si3O96- rings. Using a similar glass feedstock with Eu3+ included in the starting glass composition led to the compound NaBa3Eu3Si6O20 (2), which was determined in the noncentrosymmetric polar space group Ama2 with unit cell parameters a = 14.777(3) angstrom, b = 23.926(5) angstrom, and c = 5.5533(11) angstrom. It is constructed of individual islands of Si4O1310- and lone Si2O76- building fragments. Finally, use of the Eu-containing glass along with additional Eu2O3 led to the compound BaEu6(Si3B6O24)(OH)(2) (3), which crystallizes in the polar space group P6mm with a = 10.8074(15) angstrom and c = 4.7296(9) angstrom. It is related to the rare and poorly understood mineral cappelenite Ba(Y,RE)(6)(Si3B6O24)F-2 and contains six-membered tetrahedral borate rings linked by silicate tetrahedra. The high percentage of noncentrosymmetric crystals obtained from of a simple borosilicate glass starting material, along with various straightforward chemical additives, suggests strongly that many more noncentrosymmetric crystals can be isolated from this general system.									5	0	0	1	0	5			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000348887400029	25423282

Serendipitous Synthesis of Six Polymorphic Salt-Inclusion Magnetic Solids: Na2M3(P2O7)(2)-center dot ACl (M = Mn, Fe; A = Rb, Cs) and K2M3(P2O7)(2)center dot CsCl (M = Fe, Mn)								INORGANIC CHEMISTRY				54	3			1136	1144		10.1021/ic5024696			FEB 2 2015	2015	Single crystals of six polymorphic salt-inclusion phosphates of the A(2)M(3)(P2O7)(2)center dot A'Cl type, Na2Mn3(P2O7)(2)center dot CsCl (1), Na2Mn3(P2O7)2 center dot RbCl (2), Na2Fe3(P2O7)(2)center dot CsCl (3), Na2Fe3(P2O7)(2)center dot RbCl (4), K2Mn3(P2O7)(2)center dot CsCl (5), and K2Fe3(P2O7)(2)center dot CsCl (6), were grown in reactive molten chloride flux media. Compounds 1-4 are isostructural and crystallize in the space group C2/c (No. 15), while 5 and 6 crystallize in P2/c (No. 13) and P (1) over bar (No. 2), respectively. The title compounds have demonstrated an unprecedented versatility, where the M-3(P2O7)(2)(2-) covalent open frameworks contain [M3O12] (M = Mn2+, Fe2+) trimeric units in 1-4 and [M2O8] dimers in 5 and 6. These multinuclear, transition-metal oxide units are linked by Cl- ions through the M-Cl bonds to form one-dimensional (1D) chains. The 1D chains and [P2O7] groups share common O atoms to form the extended network. The M-3(P2O7)(2)(2-) open-framework structures exhibit channels where the respective Na+/K+ ions and A'Cl salt (A' = Rb, Cs) reside. Magnetic susceptibility of 2 and 4 suggests bulk antiferromagnetic properties as expected. The local structure and thermal decomposition are examined by IR and differential scanning calorimetry of representative compounds. The factors that determine the reticular chemistry of the M-3(P2O7)(2)(2-) type are illustrated in terms of the inclusion of ionic lattices of different sizes and contents.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0020-1669	1520-510X		WOS:000348887400056	25415041

A damaging armoured scale insect (Hemiptera: Diaspididae) infesting coconut palms was first found in the Philippines on Luzon Island (Batangas province) in 2009, and is now affecting most of the provinces of southern Luzon. The scale pest is still spreading in the Visayan Islands and Mindanao. Infestation stops photosynthesis; the leaves yellow and dry; fruits form less nutmeat and the coconut-water is sour; weak new leaflets bend over or break off; and the tree dies in 6 months or less. The scale pest is identified in the present study as Aspidiotus rigidus Reyne; it presents a significant quarantine threat to coconut-producing countries worldwide. Characters enabling the identification of A. rigidus, its host range and distribution are given. Some literature on the natural enemies and control of A. rigidus is reviewed briefly.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1461-9555	1461-9563		WOS:000348428800001

New Self-Stabilizing Algorithms for Minimal Weakly Connected Dominating Sets								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOUNDATIONS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE				26	2			229	240		10.1142/S0129054115500136			FEB 2015	2015	In this paper, we propose two new self-stabilizing algorithms, MWCDS-C and MWCDS-D, for minimal weakly connected dominating sets in an arbitrary connected graph. Algorithm MWCDS-C stabilizes in O(n(4)) steps using an unfair central daemon and space requirement at each node is O(log n) bits at each node for an arbitrary connected graph with n, nodes; it uses a designated node while other nodes are identical and anonymous. Algorithm MWCDS-D stabilizes using an unfair distributed daemon with identical time and space complexities, but it assumes unique node IDs. In the literature, the best reported stabilization time for a minimal weakly connected dominating set algorithm is O(nmA) under a distributed daemon [1], where m is the number of edges and A is the number of moves to construct a breadth- first tree.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0129-0541	1793-6373		WOS:000354049200004

SENILE (FRIC) OKUMURA (CACTACEAE)								HASELTONIA					20			13	21					FEB 2015	2015	Astrophytum coahuilense and Astrophytum capricorne var. senile have partly sympatric distributions in southern Coahuila and adjacent Zacatecas, Mexico. The apparent absence of natural hybrids in areas of sympatry has been noted by several authors, leading to speculation concerning the mechanisms of reproductive isolation. Experimental crosses between the two species revealed prezygotic isolating mechanisms in some cases and postzygotic mechanisms in others. Several different results were obtained from the cross-pollinations: 1) fruit was not produced and the ovules in the ovary of the floral remnant showed no development; 2) fruit contained incompletely developed, mostly non-germinant seeds; 3) apparently normal seed was produced, but many of the hybrid seedlings manifested morphological anomalies and mortality was high (>97%) due to chlorophyll deficiency. A series of experimental crosses between A. coahuilense and several allopatric taxa of the A. capricorne group revealed only postzygotic isolation. The discovery of prezygotic isolation in some trials between the sympatric taxa is consistent with theoretical expectations. Postzygotic isolating mechanisms are costly in terms of gametic wastage and therefore natural selection should favor the evolution of one or more prezygotic barriers between the interacting species. The varied results of the experimental crosses between A. coahuilense and A. capricorne var. senile (postzygotic isolation in some cases, prezygotic isolation in others) are possibly explained by differing histories of interaction between populations of the two species.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1070-0048	1938-2898		WOS:000351746000003

Extant information systems (IS) studies on RS have approached the phenomenon from many different perspectives, and our understanding of the nature and impacts of RS is fragmented. The current study reviews and synthesizes extant empirical IS studies to provide a coherent view of research on RS and identify gaps and future directions. Specifically, we review 40 empirical studies of RS published in 31 IS journals and five IS conference proceedings between 1990 and 2013. Using a recommendation process theoretical framework, we categorize these studies in three major areas addressed by RS research: understanding consumers, delivering recommendations, and the impacts of RS. We review and synthesize the extant literature in each area and across areas. Based on the review and synthesis, we surface research gaps and provide suggestions and potential directions for future research on recommendation systems.									3	1	0	0	0	4			1536-9323	1558-3457		WOS:000352136300001		
J	Liu, Hong-yu; Wan, Bao-yi; Zeng, Xiao-yu; Lin, Chong; Wang, Hong-jun								Effect of V and N on Microstructures and Properties of Grade-70 Tire Cord Steel during Cold Drawing								JOURNAL OF IRON AND STEEL RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL				22	2			171	178					FEB 2015	2015	Commercial grade-70 tire cord steel was microalloyed with V and N to explore the possibility of substituting V for C and the effect of V and N on cementite dissolution during cold drawing process. Tensile strength, elongation and torsion laps of cold-drawn wires were determined. Microstructures of secondary phases were studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Saturation magnetization was measured by using a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) to evaluate cementite dissolution during cold drawing process. Experimental results showed that with the increase of V content, tensile strength increased, elongation slightly decreased. and the torsion laps of the cold-drawn wires decreased. Results also showed that with the increase of N content, a peak (increasing first and then decreasing) appeared in the tensile strength graph, and an increase of elongation and a decrease of torsion laps of the cold-drawn wires occured. N is soluble in ferrite when its content is low. The increase in the content of N to 82 X 10(-6) will result in the precipitation of the V-containing secondary phases. Also. cementite tended to be stable during cold drawing process with the increase of V and N contents. Grade-80 tire cord steel can be replaced by grade-70 tire cord steel microalloyed with 0. 086 mass% V.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1006-706X	2210-3988		WOS:000351425100012

Despite the large body of work addressing PCOs, a global synchronization result for networks that are more general than all-to-all connected is still unavailable. In this paper we address global synchronization of PCO networks described by cycle graphs. It is shown for the bidirectional cycle case that as the number of oscillators in the cycle grows, the coupling strength must be increased in order to guarantee synchronization for arbitrary initial conditions. For the unidirectional cycle case, the strongest coupling cannot ensure global synchronization yet a refractory period in the phase response curve is sufficient to enable global synchronization. Analytical findings are confirmed by numerical simulations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0005-1098	1873-2836		WOS:000350780100025

Malnutrition-Induced Wernicke's Encephalopathy Following a Water-Only Fasting Diet								NUTRITION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE				30	1			92	99		10.1177/0884533614561793			FEB 2015	2015	Background: Wernicke's encephalopathy is a critical condition of neurological dysfunction resulting from a deficiency in thiamine. Chronic alcoholism is recognized as the most common cause of Wernicke's encephalopathy, but other causes, including fasting/starvation and malnutrition, have been documented within the scientific literature. These causes may not be readily recognized by healthcare professionals and may lead to Wernicke's encephalopathy being overlooked as a diagnosis when a nonalcoholic patient presents with classic signs and symptoms of the disorder. Materials and Methods: A narrative review of thiamine and its relationship to the development, diagnosis, and treatment of Wernicke's encephalopathy is presented based on a review of evidence-based guidelines and published research. To heighten awareness of the development of Wernicke's encephalopathy in fasted/starved and malnourished patients and to contribute to the scientific body of knowledge for the identification and management of Wernicke's encephalopathy in these patients, the clinical course and treatment of an adult woman who developed Wernicke's encephalopathy following a 40-day water-only fasting diet is outlined. Results: Clinical suspicion was required to identify the patient's condition and initiate immediate intervention through parenteral thiamine administration. Oral thiamine supplementation of 100 to 800 mg per day for 6 months was required to aid recovery. Outcomes: The patient's clinical course and response to treatment illustrate the necessity for clinical awareness and suspicion of Wernicke's encephalopathy among healthcare professionals, timely and adequate parenteral thiamine administration, and oral thiamine supplementation at therapeutic doses to correct the nutrient deficiency, halt the progression of Wernicke's encephalopathy, and promote recovery.									3	0	0	1	0	3			0884-5336	1941-2452		WOS:000348376200009	25524882	
J	Shen, Haiying; Li, Ze								A Hierarchical Account-Aided Reputation Management System for MANETs								IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING				23	1			70	84		10.1109/TNET.2013.2290731			FEB 2015	2015	Encouraging cooperation and deterring selfish behaviors are important for proper operations of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). For this purpose, most previous efforts rely on either reputation systems or price systems. However, these systems are neither sufficiently effective in providing cooperation incentives nor sufficiently efficient in resource consumption. Nodes in both systems can be uncooperative while still being considered trustworthy. Also, information exchange between mobile nodes in reputation systems and credit circulation in price systems consumes significant resources. This paper presents a hierarchical Account-aided Reputation Management system (ARM) to efficiently and effectively provide cooperation incentives. ARM builds a hierarchical locality-aware distributed hash table (DHT) infrastructure for efficient and integrated operation of both reputation and price systems. The infrastructure helps to globally collect all node reputation information in the system, which can be used to calculate more accurate reputation and detect abnormal reputation information. Also, ARM integrates reputation and price systems by enabling higher-reputed nodes to pay less for their received services. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the properties of ARM. Simulation results show that ARM outperforms the individual reputation system and price system in terms of effectiveness and efficiency of providing cooperation incentives and deterring selfish behaviors.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1063-6692	1558-2566		WOS:000350342300006		
J	Chen, Kang; Shen, Haiying								DTN-FLOW: Inter-Landmark Data Flow for High-Throughput Routing in DTNs								IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING				23	1			212	226		10.1109/TNET.2013.2296751			FEB 2015	2015	In this paper, we focus on the efficient routing of data among different areas in delay tolerant networks (DTNs). In current algorithms, packets are forwarded gradually through nodes with higher probability of visiting the destination node or area. However, the number of such nodes usually is limited, leading to insufficient throughput performance. To solve this problem, we propose an inter-landmark data routing algorithm, namely DTN-FLOW. It selects popular places that nodes visit frequently as landmarks and divides the entire DTN area into subareas represented by landmarks. Nodes transiting between landmarks relay packets among landmarks, even though they rarely visit the destinations of these packets. Specifically, the number of node transits between two landmarks is measured to represent the forwarding capacity between them, based on which routing tables are built on each landmark to guide packet routing. Each node predicts its transits based on its previous landmark visiting records using the order-k Markov predictor. When routing a packet, the landmark determines the next-hop landmark based on its routing table and forwards the packet to the node with the highest probability of transiting to the selected landmark. Thus, DTN-FLOW fully utilizes all node movements to route packets along landmark-based paths to their destinations. We analyzed two real DTN traces to support the design of DTN-FLOW. We deployed a small DTN-FLOW system on our campus for performance evaluation. We also proposed advanced extensions to improve its efficiency and stability. The real deployment and trace-driven simulation demonstrate the high efficiency of DTN-FLOW in comparison to state-of-the-art DTN routing algorithms.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1063-6692	1558-2566		WOS:000350342300017

A note on helicity conservation in Leray models of incompressible flow								JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS				422	1			776	781		10.1016/j.jmaa.2014.09.014			FEB 1 2015	2015	We prove conservation of a regularized helicity H-L := integral(Omega) u center dot w dx for the Leray model (and its variants) of turbulent flow, where w is the solution of a Leray-regularized vorticity equation. The usual definition of helicity is H = integral(Omega) u center dot (del x u) dx, which is considered by Navier-Stokes flows, but is not a conserved quantity of the Leray model. However, if u is a Leray solution, then the difference between H and H-L is that H-L uses a regularized vorticity and H uses the curl of a regularized velocity. The results are extended to show that the standard Crank-Nicolson finite element method for Leray models conserves both discrete energy and discrete regularized helicity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Manure Source and Age Affect Survival of Zoonotic Pathogens during Aerobic Composting at Sublethal Temperatures								JOURNAL OF FOOD PROTECTION				78	2			302	310		10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-14-288			FEB 2015	2015	Heat is the primary mechanism by which aerobic composting inactivates zoonotic bacterial pathogens residing within animal manures, but at sublethal temperatures, the time necessary to hold the compost materials to ensure pathogen inactivation is uncertain. To determine the influence of the type of nitrogen amendment on inactivation of Salmonella, Listeria monocyto genes, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 in compost mixtures stored at sublethal temperatures, specific variables investigated in these studies included the animal source of the manure, the initial carbon/nitrogen (C:N) ratio of the compost mixture, and the age of the manure. Salmonella and L. monocyto genes were both inactivated more rapidly in chicken and swine compost mixtures stored at 20 degrees C when formulated to an initial C:N ratio of 20:1 compared with 40:1, whereas a C:N ratio did not have an effect on inactivation of these pathogens in cow compost mixtures. Pathogen inactivation was related to the elevated pH of the samples that likely arises from ammonia produced by the indigenous microflora in the compost mixtures. Indigenous microbial activity was reduced when compost mixtures were stored at 30 degrees C and drier conditions (<10% moisture level) were prevalent. Furthermore, under these drier conditions, Salmonella persisted to a greater extent than L. monocyto genes, and the desiccation resistance of Salmonella appeared to convey cross-protection to ammonia. Salmonella persisted longer in compost mixtures prepared with aged chicken litter compared with fresh chicken litter, whereas E. coli O157:H7 survived to similar extents in compost mixtures prepared with either fresh or aged cow manure. The different responses observed when different sources of manure were used in compost mixtures reveal that guidelines with times required for pathogen inactivation in compost mixtures stored at sublethal temperatures should be dependent on the source of nitrogen, i.e., type of animal manure, present.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0362-028X	1944-9097		WOS:000349064800009	25710145	
J	Dahle, Jessica T.; Arai, Yuji								Environmental Geochemistry of Cerium: Applications and Toxicology of Cerium Oxide Nanoparticles								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH				12	2			1253	1278		10.3390/ijerph120201253			FEB 2015	2015	Cerium is the most abundant of rare-earth metals found in the Earth's crust. Several Ce-carbonate, -phosphate, -silicate, and -(hydr)oxide minerals have been historically mined and processed for pharmaceutical uses and industrial applications. Of all Ce minerals, cerium dioxide has received much attention in the global nanotechnology market due to their useful applications for catalysts, fuel cells, and fuel additives. A recent mass flow modeling study predicted that a major source of CeO2 nanoparticles from industrial processing plants (e.g., electronics and optics manufactures) is likely to reach the terrestrial environment such as landfills and soils. The environmental fate of CeO2 nanoparticles is highly dependent on its physcochemical properties in low temperature geochemical environment. Though there are needs in improving the analytical method in detecting/quantifying CeO2 nanoparticles in different environmental media, it is clear that aquatic and terrestrial organisms have been exposed to CeO2 NPs, potentially yielding in negative impact on human and ecosystem health. Interestingly, there has been contradicting reports about the toxicological effects of CeO2 nanoparticles, acting as either an antioxidant or reactive oxygen species production-inducing agent). This poses a challenge in future regulations for the CeO2 nanoparticle application and the risk assessment in the environment.									15	0	0	7	0	15			1660-4601			WOS:000350209800012	25625406

Lepidoptera (Crambidae, Noctuidae, and Pyralidae) Injury to Corn Containing Single and Pyramided Bt Traits, and Blended or Block Refuge, in the Southern United States								JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY				108	1			157	165		10.1093/jee/tou009			FEB 2015	2015	Fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae); corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea Boddie (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae); southwestern corn borer, Diatraea grandiosella Dyar (Lepidoptera: Crambidae); sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis F. (Lepidoptera: Crambidae); and lesser cornstalk borer, Elasmopalpus lignosellus Zeller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), are lepidopteran pests of corn, Zea mays L., in the southern United States. Blended refuge for transgenic plants expressing the insecticidal protein derivative from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) has recently been approved as an alternative resistance management strategy in the northern United States. We conducted a two-year study with 39 experiments across 12 states in the southern United States to evaluate plant injury from these five species of Lepidoptera to corn expressing Cry1F and Cry1Ab, as both single and pyramided traits, a pyramid of Cry1Ab x Vip3Aa20, and a pyramid of Cry1F x Cry1Ab plus non-Bt in a blended refuge. Leaf injury and kernel damage from corn earworm and fall armyworm, and stalking tunneling by southwestern corn borer, were similar in Cry1F x Cry1Ab plants compared with the Cry1F x Cry1Ab plus non-Bt blended refuge averaged across five-plant clusters. When measured on an individual plant basis, leaf injury, kernel damage, stalk tunneling (southwestern corn borer), and dead or injured plants (lesser cornstalk borer) were greater in the blended non-Bt refuge plants compared to Cry1F x Cry1Ab plants in the non-Bt and pyramided Cry1F x Cry1Ab blended refuge treatment. When non-Bt blended refuge plants were compared to a structured refuge of non-Bt plants, no significant difference was detected in leaf injury, kernel damage, or stalk tunneling (southwestern corn borer). Plant stands in the non-Bt and pyramided Cry1F x Cry1Ab blended refuge treatment had more stalk tunneling from sugarcane borer and plant death from lesser cornstalk borer compared to a pyramided Cry1F x Cry1Ab structured refuge treatment. Hybrid plants containing Cry1F x Cry1Ab within the pyramided Cry1F x Cry1Ab blended refuge treatment had significantly less kernel damage than non-Bt structured refuge treatments. Both single and pyramided Bt traits were effective against southwestern corn borer, sugarcane borer, and lesser cornstalk borer.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0022-0493	1938-291X		WOS:000350033700021	26470116	
J	Yao, Hai; Huda, Walter; Mah, Eugene; He, Wenjun								Review of Kerma-Area Product and total energy incident on patients in radiography, mammography and CT								RADIATION PROTECTION DOSIMETRY				163	2			251	260		10.1093/rpd/ncu157			FEB 2015	2015	This study estimated the energy incident on patients in radiography, mammography and CT using data related to X-ray beam quantity and quality. The total X-ray beam quantity is the average Air Kerma multiplied by the X-ray beam area and expressed as the Kerma-Area Product (Gy cm(-2)). The X-ray beam quality primarily depends on the target material (and anode angle), X-ray voltage (and ripple) as well as X-ray beam filtration. For any X-ray spectra, dividing total energy (fluence x mean energy) by the X-ray beam Kerma-Area Product yields the energy per Kerma-Area Product value (epsilon/KAP). Published data on X-ray spectra characteristics and energy fluence per Air Kerma conversion factors were used to determine epsilon/KAP factors. In radiography, epsilon/KAP increased from 6 mJ Gy(-1) cm(-2) at the lowest X-ray tube voltage (50 kV) to 25 mJ Gy(-1) cm(-2) at the highest X-ray tube voltage (140 kV). epsilon/KAP values ranged between 1 and 5 mJ Gy(-1) cm(-2) in mammography and between 24 and 42 mJ Gy(-1) cm(-2) in CT. Changes in waveform ripple resulted in variations in epsilon/KAP of up to 15 %, similar to the effect of changes resulting in the choice of anode angle. For monoenergetic X-ray photons, there was a sigmoidal-type increase in epsilon/KAP from 2 mJ Gy(-1) cm(-2) at 20 keV to 42 mJ Gy(-1) cm(-2) at 80 keV. However, between 80 and 150 keV, the epsilon/KAP shows variations with changing photon energy of < 10 %. Taking the average spectrum energy to consist of monoenergetic X rays generally overestimates the true value of epsilon/KAP. This study illustrated that the energy incident on a patient in any area of radiological imaging can be estimated from the total X-ray beam intensity (KAP) when X-ray beam quality is taken into account. Energy incident on the patient can be used to estimate the energy absorbed by the patient and the corresponding patient effective dose.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0144-8420	1742-3406		WOS:000350116400015	24821931

There is an inverse relationship between education and mortality risk. The relationship is explained in full by each of the three mechanisms: other socioeconomic attainments, social relationships and activities, and health status, and partially by physical exercise. In addition, primary education has a stronger effect on mortality for men than for women and the effect of education is stronger for the young old than for the oldest old. These findings underscore the importance of national and subpopulation contexts in understanding the relationship between education and mortality. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

An optimal biocompatible platform for neural activation efficiently transfers electrical signals across the electrode-cell interface and also incorporates large-area neural guidance conduits. Inherently conducting polymers (ICPs) have emerged as frontrunners as soft biocompatible alternatives to traditionally used metal electrodes, which are highly invasive and elicit tissue damage over long-term implantation. However, fabrication techniques for the ICPs suffer a major bottleneck, which limits their usability and medical translation. Herein, we report that these limitations can be overcome using colloidal chemistry to fabricate multimodal conducting polymer nanoparticles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these polymer nanoparticles can be precisely assembled into large-area linear conduits using surface chemistry. Finally, we validate that this platform can act as guidance conduits for neurostimulation, whereby the presence of electrical current induces remarkable dendritic axonal sprouting of cells.									7	0	0	1	0	7			1936-0851	1936-086X		WOS:000349940500072	25623615

The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency surfaces were touched by child care providers to identify surfaces that should be cleaned and sanitized.Methods: Observation data from a convenience sample of 37 child care facilities in North Carolina and South Carolina were analyzed. Trained data collectors used iPods (Apple, Cupertino, CA) to record hand touch events of 1 child care provider for 45 minutes in up to 2 classrooms in each facility.Results: Across the 37 facilities, 10,134 hand contacts were observed in 51 classrooms. Most (4,536) were contacts with porous surfaces, with an average of 88.9 events per classroom observation. The most frequently touched porous surface was children's clothing. The most frequently touched nonporous surface was food contact surfaces (18.6 contacts/observation). Surfaces commonly identified as high-touch surfaces (ie, light switches, handrails, doorknobs) were touched the least.Conclusion: General cleaning and sanitizing guidelines should include detailed procedures for cleaning and sanitizing high-touch surfaces (ie, clothes, furniture, soft toys). Guidelines are available for nonporous surfaces but not for porous surfaces (eg, clothing, carpeting). Additional research is needed to inform the development of evidence-based practices to effectively treat porous surfaces.

To operate effectively and create value, EDs must be flexible, having the ability to rapidly adapt to the highly variable needs of patients. The concept of flexibility has not been well described in the ED literature. We introduce the concept, outline its potential benefits, and provide some illustrative examples to facilitate incorporating flexibility into ED management. We draw on operations research and organizational theory to identify and describe 5 forms of flexibility: physical, human resource, volume, behavioral, and conceptual. Each form of flexibility may be useful individually or in combination with other forms in improving ED performance and enhancing value. We also offer suggestions for measuring operational flexibility in the ED. A better understanding of operational flexibility and its application to the ED may help us move away from reactive approaches of managing variable demand to a more systematic approach. We also address the tension between cost and flexibility and outline how "partial flexibility" may help resolve some challenges. Applying concepts of flexibility from other disciplines may help clinicians and administrators think differently about their workflow and provide new insights into managing issues of cost, flow, and quality in the ED.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0196-0644			WOS:000349054600009	25233811

We use a public feed of bus location and velocity data in the city of San Francisco, CA, USA, as an example data source. We show that it is possible to estimate, fairly accurately, cycle times and the duration of reds for fixed-time traffic lights traversed by buses using a few days' worth of aggregated bus data. Furthermore, we also estimate the start of greens in real time by monitoring the movement of buses across intersections. The results are encouraging, given that each bus sends an update only sporadically (approximate to every 200 m) and that bus passages are infrequent (every 5-10 min). When made available on an open server, such information about the traffic signals' phase and timing can be valuable in enabling new fuel efficiency and safety functionalities in connected vehicles. Velocity advisory systems can use the estimated timing plan to calculate velocity trajectories that reduce idling time at red signals and therefore improve fuel efficiency and lower emissions. Advanced engine management strategies can shut down the engine in anticipation of a long idling interval at red. Intersection collision avoidance and active safety systems could also benefit from the prediction.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1524-9050	1558-0016		WOS:000349391200002

This brief develops a high level framework that generates a multiprocessor systems on chip architecture from a library of heterogeneous processing resources that can be reconfigured to support various modes of operation. The framework proposes joint task and core mapping with system level floorplanning. With the objective of minimizing energy, we develop an analytical probabilistic model that considers static, dynamic, configuration, and communication energy components for multiple applications characterized by probabilities of execution. Finally, a fast energy aware joint task and core mapping heuristic is proposed and performance is demonstrated on realistic benchmarks.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1063-8210	1557-9999		WOS:000349420400018

This long term study allowed monitoring the patterns of NDMA FPs under dynamic weather conditions (e.g., rainy and dry periods) covering several seasons. Anthropogenically impacted waters which were determined by high sucralose levels (>100 ng/L) had higher NDMA FPs than limited impacted sources (<100 ng/L). In most sources, NDMA FP showed more variability in spring months, while seasonal mean values remained relatively consistent. The study also showed that watershed characteristics played an important role in the seasonal and temporal patterns. In the two dam-controlled river systems (SW A and G), the NDMA FP levels at the downstream sampling locations were controlled by the NDMA levels in the dams independent of either the increases in discharge rates due to water releases from the dams prior to or during the heavy rain events or intermittent high NDMA FP levels observed at the upstream of dams. The large reservoirs and impoundments on rivers examined in this study appeared serving as an equalization basin for NDMA precursors. On the other hand, in a river without an upstream reservoir (SW E), the NDMA levels were influenced by the ratio of an upstream wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent discharge to the river discharge rate. The impact of WWTP effluent decreased during the high river flow periods due to rain events. Linear regression with independent variables DOC, DON, and sucralose yielded poor correlations with NDMA FP (R-2 < 0.27). Multiple linear regression analysis using DOG and log [sucralose] yielded a better correlation with NDMA FP (R-2 = 0.53). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Manipulation of cellular spheroid composition and the effects on vascular tissue fusion								ACTA BIOMATERIALIA				13				188	198		10.1016/j.actbio.2014.11.024			FEB 2015	2015	Cellular spheroids were investigated as tissue-engineered building blocks that can be fused to form functional tissue constructs. While spheroids can be assembled using passive contacts for the fusion of complex tissues, physical forces can be used to promote active contacts to improve tissue homogeneity and accelerate tissue fusion. Understanding the mechanisms affecting the fusion of spheroids is critical to fabricating tissues. Here, manipulation of the spheroid composition was used to accelerate the fusion process mediated by magnetic forces. The Janus structure of magnetic cellular spheroids spatially controls iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) to form two distinct domains: cells and extracellular MNPs. Studies were performed to evaluate the influence of extracellular matrix (ECM) content and cell number on the fusion of Janus magnetic cellular spheroids (JMCSs). Results showed that the integration of iron oxide MNPs into spheroids increased the production of collagen over time when compared to spheroids without MNPs. The results also showed that ring tissues composed of JMCSs with high ECM concentrations and high cell numbers fused together, but exhibited less contraction when compared to their lower concentration counterparts. Results from spheroid fusion in capillary tubes showed that low ECM concentrations and high cell numbers experienced more fusion and cellular intermixing over time when compared to their higher counterparts. These findings indicate that cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions play an important role in regulating fusion, and this understanding sets the rationale of spheroid composition to fabricate larger and more complex tissue-engineered constructs.

In the medium time horizon, in order to gain market share, he has to minimize his selling price while looking at the profit, which is dependent on the revenues from selling and the costs to buy energy from forward contracts and participation in the market pool. In this paper, the two competing objectives are engaged proposing a new multi-objective framework in which a epsilon-constraint mathematical technique is used to produce the Pareto front (set of optimal solutions). The stochasticity of energy prices in the market and customer load demand are coped with the Lattice Monte Carlo Simulation (LMCS) and the method of the roulette wheel, which allow the stochastic multi-objective problem to be turned into a set of deterministic equivalents. The method performance is tested into some case studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0196-8904	1879-2227		WOS:000348887000002

Survival of Salmonella or Escherichia coli O157:H7 during Holding of Manure-Based Compost Mixtures at Sublethal Temperatures as Influenced by the Carbon Amendment								JOURNAL OF FOOD PROTECTION				78	2			248	255		10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-14-289			FEB 2015	2015	During the early phases of aerobic composting of animal manures, pathogens are inactivated primarily from the accumulation of heat produced by indigenous microbial activity. When compost materials are not exposed to these lethal temperatures, the required holding time needed to obtain a pathogen-free product that may be applied to fields is unknown. Consequently, a series of studies examined whether the carbon amendment (wheat straw, peanut hulls, rice hulls, and pine needles) added to animal manures affected survival of either Salmonella or E. coli O157:H7 during storage of compost mixtures at sublethal temperatures (20 to 40 degrees C) Pathogens consistently survived for longer periods of time in compost mixtures prepared with pine needles than compost mixtures prepared with either of the other three carbon amendments. Pathogen inactivation in wheat straw or peanut hull amended compost mixtures was dependent on the target pathogen, moisture level, and storage temperature. Moisture levels in wheat straw amended compost mixtures stored at 40 degrees C had no effect on inactivation of E. coli O157:H7. In contrast, wheat straw amended mixtures stored at 30 to 35 degrees C and equilibrated to suboptimal moisture contents (30 to 40%) were less effective for inactivating pathogens compared with drier (25% moisture) or moister (60% moisture) mixtures. In peanut hull amended compost mixtures, inactivation of E. coli O157:H7 was affected minimally by moisture levels, whereas Salmonella survival increased as the moisture level was decreased. The different inactivation responses of Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7 in compost mixtures prepared with wheat straw or peanut hulls' and equilibrated to different moisture levels suggest that there are different mechanisms for inactivation. Hence, developing reliable guidelines relying on time-temperature for holding of compost mixtures at sublethal temperatures will be challenging and, perhaps, not possible.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0362-028X	1944-9097		WOS:000349064800002	25710138

A systematic search of the published literature yielded 268 candidate articles, from which a set of 23 articles reporting intervention outcomes was retained for evaluation. A categorization of measured outcomes is reported; studies addressed multiple outcomes ranging from knowledge, attitudes, and behavior of personal hygiene and food safety to management practices and disease rates and outbreaks. This study also investigates the quality of reported research methods used to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions, using a nine-point quality index adapted by the authors. The observed scores suggest that there are opportunities to improve the design and reporting of research in the field of foodborne disease prevention as it applies to food safety interventions that target the food service industry. The aim is to aid researchers in this area to design higher quality studies and to produce clearer and more useful reports of their research. In turn, this can help to create a more complete evidence base that can be used to continually improve interventions in this domain.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0362-028X	1944-9097		WOS:000349064800029	25710165

Experimental and Computational Study of the Shearing Resistance of Polyurea at High Pressures and High Strain Rates								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				24	2			778	798		10.1007/s11665-014-1316-x			FEB 2015	2015	Mechanical response of polyurea, a nanophase segregated elastomeric co-polymer, is investigated using all-atom, equilibrium, molecular-dynamics methods and tools. Specifically, the effects of high pressure (1-30 GPa) and high strain rate (10(5)-10(6) s(-1)) on the shearing resistance of polyurea are examined. Such loading conditions are encountered by polyurea coatings subjected to impact by high-velocity projectiles, shell shrapnel, and improvised explosive device fragments. Computed results are compared with their experimental counterparts obtained using the so-called pressure-shear plate impact experiments. Computed results have also been rationalized in terms of the nanosegregated polyurea microstructure consisting of rod-shaped, discrete, the so-called hard domains embedded in a highly compliant, the so-called soft matrix. By analyzing molecular-level microstructure and its evolution during high-rate deformation and under high imposed pressures, an attempt is made to identify and quantify main phenomena in viscous/inelastic deformation and microstructure-reorganization processes that are most likely responsible for the observed mechanical response of polyurea.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1059-9495	1544-1024		WOS:000349009400026

Ultralow reflectors (< -60 dB) were obtained. IFPIs with different physical lengths showed identical temperature sensitivity (-1.5 GHz/degrees C). A distributed temperature sensing test was conducted. No crosstalk between IFPI elements in the array was observed, implying the device's utility as a distributed sensing system. The possibility of using smaller bandwidths for sensor interrogation was experimentally proven. A small-scale temperature distribution test was conducted on a continuously cascaded ultraweak IFPI array, demonstrating its high spatial resolution. The temperature detection limit of this system was measured to be less than 0.0667 degrees C.

Like with the design of any technology from a human-centered perspective, we aim to determine how to best utilize technology so that it is both easy to use and works for its intended purpose. To accomplish this, we surveyed 325 patients currently receiving treatment at community-based outpatient clinics for mental illness to determine their cell phone ownership and usage patterns. Our results showed that cell phone ownership among these mental health patients was comparable with ownership among a nationally representative sample, with the exception that more patients than non-patients shared their mobile phones. Among mental health patients, we found that texting was the most popular feature used and downloading apps was the least popular. Based on these results, we concluded that texting may be a feasible form of treatment aid for those with mental illness and may be useful as a supplementary treatment for those with low income or little to no access to treatment. Further research should investigate privacy measures for using mobile technology as a treatment aid, especially for those who share a phone, and explore the types of mHealth treatment aids that could be the most effective.									6	0	0	2	0	6			1617-4909	1617-4917		WOS:000348445900009

In this study, approximately 900 leaf explants of 'Guardian(A (R))' peach genotype were separated from in vitro shoots and cultured for shoot regeneration on A1/2 MS medium with different doses and combinations of thidiazuron (TDZ) and silver thiosulphate (STS). The results showed that callus bud formation and shoot regeneration occurred 4 and 6 weeks after culture initiation, respectively. All the regenerated shoots were from petioles of the leaf explants. Regeneration rates were significantly affected by different combinations of TDZ and STS (P < 0.05). Separation of means by Tukey test method revealed that on half strength MS media, high regeneration rates were obtained from the combinations of 6.81 A mu M TDZ + 10 A mu M STS, and of 9.08 A mu M TDZ + 10 A mu M STS (16 and 14 %, respectively). The number of shoots per regenerating explants was also significantly affected by growth regulator concentrations. The highest shoot number was obtained with the combination of 6.81 A mu M TDZ + 10 A mu M STS. Rooting percentage varied from 85 to 100 % depending on plant growth regulator used. On half strength MS medium containing 1.0 mg/l of IBA, an average of 7 roots per regenerating shoot was produced. The rooted plantlets were successfully acclimatized with 92 % survival rate under greenhouse conditions. This established regeneration system from leaf explants would facilitate the development of reliable peach genetic transformation procedures, helping accelerate peach genetic improvement using biotechnology approaches.									3	1	0	3	0	4			0167-6857	1573-5044		WOS:000348807200030

Heat-treated carbon nanofibers, Pyrograf((R)) III PR-19 heat treatment (HT) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNT) HT were dispersed in a linear low-density polyethylene matrix to produce flow-induced orientation of the nanomodifiers in the spun microfilaments. Consequently, the electrical conductivity of the resulting nanocomposites exhibited anisotropic behavior due to the nanomodifier orientation. The in-plane conductivity in the longitudinal direction (PR-19 HT comp.: approximate to 0.02 S/m; MWNT HT comp.: approximate to 3 S/m) was at least an order of magnitude higher than that along the transverse direction. As measured with a rectangular waveguide (WR510, 1.45-2.2 GHz), the PR-19 HT- and MWNT HT-oriented nanocomposites (1-mm thick) displayed EM SE values of 0.7 dB and 3.0 dB, respectively, when the nanomodifiers were transversely oriented with the polarized electric field. In contrast, when the orientation of the nanomodifiers was parallel with the field, EM SE values of 3.2 and 9.0 dB were obtained, respectively. The higher EM SE values are consistent with high conductivities observed in the direction of preferred orientation of the modifiers. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 55:299-307, 2015.

Diagnosing Hospital System Bargaining Power in Managed Care Networks								AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL-ECONOMIC POLICY				7	1			243	274		10.1257/pol.20130009			FEB 2015	2015	We investigate the impact of hospital system membership on negotiations between hospitals and managed care organizations (MCOs). Previous research finds that system hospitals secure higher reimbursements by exploiting local market concentration. By leveraging system membership in the bargaining game, however, system hospitals may also extract a higher percentage of their value to an MCO. Our findings reveal that more of the observed price gap between system and nonsystem hospitals can be attributed to bargaining power differences than to differences linked to relative concentration. These results highlight the importance of explicitly modeling the bargaining process when evaluating negotiated-price markets more generally.

The aged chicken litter with 20, 30, 40, and 50% moisture contents was inoculated with a mixture of four Salmonella serotypes for a 24-h adaptation. Afterwards, the inoculated chicken litter was added into the chicken litter with the adjusted moisture content for a 1-h moist-heat treatment at 65 degrees C and 100% relative humidity inside a water bath, followed by a dry-heat treatment in a convection oven at 85 degrees C for 1 h to the desired moisture level (<10-12%). After moist-heat treatment, the populations of Salmonella in aged chicken litter at 20 and 30% moisture contents declined from approximate to 6.70 log colony-forming units (CFU)/g to 3.31 and 3.00 log CFU/g, respectively. After subsequent 1-h dry-heat treatment, the populations further decreased to 2.97 and 2.57 log CFU/g, respectively. Salmonella cells in chicken litter with 40% and 50% moisture contents were only detectable by enrichment after 40 and 20 min of moist-heat treatment, respectively. Moisture contents in all samples were reduced to 5.5 logs of desiccation-adapted Salmonella in aged chicken litter with moisture content at or above 40%. Clearly, the findings from this study may provide the chicken litter processing industry with an effective heat treatment method for producing Salmonella-free chicken litter.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1535-3141	1556-7125		WOS:000349008100002	25405539

Flow pathways are driven by hydraulic gradients but controlled by material permeability, which varies over many orders of magnitude and changes over time. Although millions of measurements of crustal properties have been made, including geophysical imaging and borehole tests, this vast amount of data and information has not been integrated into a comprehensive knowledge system. A community data infrastructure is needed to improve data access, enable large-scale synthetic analyses, and support representations of the subsurface in Earth system models. Here, we describe the motivation, vision, challenges, and an action plan for a community-governed, four-dimensional data system of the Earth's crustal structure, composition, and material properties from the surface down to the brittle-ductile transition. Such a system must not only be sufficiently flexible to support inquiries in many different domains of Earth science, but it must also be focused on characterizing the physical crustal properties of permeability and porosity, which have not yet been synthesized at a large scale. The DigitalCrust is envisioned as an interactive virtual exploration laboratory where models can be calibrated with empirical data and alternative hypotheses can be tested at a range of spatial scales. It must also support a community process for compiling and harmonizing models into regional syntheses of crustal properties. Sustained peer review from multiple disciplines will allow constant refinement in the ability of the system to inform science questions and societal challenges and to function as a dynamic library of our knowledge of Earth's crust.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1468-8115	1468-8123		WOS:000348505200023

Using large sample archival data from a state juvenile justice agency, we examined the behavioral and demographic predictors of repeat offending for a sample of approximately 34,000 females who had been referred for criminal offenses. Then, after merging these data with those from multiple state agencies, we compared the family and mental health histories of the delinquent females with those of females from a matched control group of the same number, constructed from the records of the state department of education. Drug use, family delinquency, severity of first offenses, and age of first offending were predictors of repeat offending for the females in the delinquent sample. Compared with non-delinquent females, delinquent females were more likely to be eligible for free or reduced lunch, and were more likely to have been in foster care or child protective services. The strongest predictor of membership in the delinquent sample was a DSM-IV diagnosis of a mental health disorder related to aggression or impulse control. All variables associated with delinquency remained significant when other predictors were statistically controlled. Implications for prevention of female juvenile delinquency were addressed.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1062-1024	1573-2843		WOS:000348397700019

Cellular orchestrated biomineralization of crystalline composites on implant surfaces by the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin, 1791)								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY				463				8	16		10.1016/j.jembe.2014.10.014			FEB 2015	2015	The phylum Mollusca is unmatched in the mastery of cellular-engineered shell microstructures, producing shells that are visually elegant, structurally complex and fracture resistant. Shell formation in the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica is a process that involves both hemocytes (blood cells) and the outer mantle epithelial cells (OME). This study reports the secretion of an extracellular matrix (ECM) and cellular activity during shell layer formation by observing folia and prismatic development on different metal alloy surfaces (Ti6Al4V titanium, 7075-T6 aluminum, and 316 L stainless steel) implanted under the OME. During prism formation, a close association was observed between the ECM surrounding the prisms, the OME, and hemocytes. The prismatic ECM walls appeared to originate from the OME surface and were auto-fluorescent. During folia formation, an initial infiltration response of hemocytes to the implant surface was observed followed by the formation of a thin translucent ECM membrane onto which exosome-like vesicles, some containing crystals, deposited. These structures progressively organized into well-defined folia mineral. It is proposed that molluscan shell is formed through a series of coordinated events involving cells and cell products whereby both organic and mineral phases are secreted, organized, and simultaneously formed. The coordination of cells and cell products for shell synthesis opens a new realm of cellular control not previously explored in shell formation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Most models used that are appropriate for traditional catchments can be applied successfully to drained porous pavements; however, these models do not match the expected hydrologic behavior of undrained porous pavements. Undrained porous pavements exhibit a fill-and-spill response to rainfall events. While forcing an undrained pavement's fill-and-spill behavior into a conventional runoff model may simplify design, it does so at the cost of accuracy. This research models the rainfall-runoff relationship for undrained porous pavements and proposes a broken-line model as an appropriate characterization of the behavior. The breakpoint of the model represents the initial abstraction of the pavement, and the slope of the upper line is primarily a function of the infiltration capacity of the underlying soil. Because both the initial abstraction and slope are functions of the pavement storage capacity and 24-h infiltration depth, a broad range of pavements were modeled and the results were compiled into figures, allowing the direct lookup of the model's parameters. This new characterization of the hydrologic behavior of porous pavement provides a simple but more accurate model of the actual behavior, which will enable designers and regulators to easily calculate and understand an undrained pavement's hydraulic behavior.

Local adaptation despite high gene flow in the waterfall-climbing Hawaiian goby, Sicyopterus stimpsoni								MOLECULAR ECOLOGY				24	3			545	563		10.1111/mec.13016			FEB 2015	2015	Environmental heterogeneity can promote the emergence of locally adapted phenotypes among subpopulations of a species, whereas gene flow can result in phenotypic and genotypic homogenization. For organisms like amphidromous fishes that change habitats during their life history, the balance between selection and migration can shift through ontogeny, making the likelihood of local adaptation difficult to predict. In Hawaiian waterfall-climbing gobies, it has been hypothesized that larval mixing during oceanic dispersal counters local adaptation to contrasting topographic features of streams, like slope gradient, that can select for predator avoidance or climbing ability in juvenile recruits. To test this hypothesis, we used morphological traits and neutral genetic markers to compare phenotypic and genotypic distributions in recruiting juveniles and adult subpopulations of the waterfall-climbing amphidromous goby, Sicyopterus stimpsoni, from the islands of Hawai'i and Kaua'i. We found that body shape is significantly different between adult subpopulations from streams with contrasting slopes and that trait divergence in recruiting juveniles tracked stream topography more so than morphological measures of adult subpopulation differentiation. Although no evidence of population genetic differentiation was observed among adult subpopulations, we observed low but significant levels of spatially and temporally variable genetic differentiation among juvenile cohorts, which correlated with morphological divergence. Such a pattern of genetic differentiation is consistent with chaotic genetic patchiness arising from variable sources of recruits to different streams. Thus, at least in S.stimpsoni, the combination of variation in settlement cohorts in space and time coupled with strong postsettlement selection on juveniles as they migrate upstream to adult habitats provides the opportunity for morphological adaptation to local stream environments despite high gene flow.									9	0	0	9	0	9			0962-1083	1365-294X		WOS:000348516900003	25442423

Photo-induced toxicity of titanium dioxide nanoparticles to Daphnia magna under natural sunlight								CHEMOSPHERE				120				206	210		10.1016/j.chemosphere.2014.06.075			FEB 2015	2015	Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NP) are one of the most abundantly utilized nanoparticles in the world. Studies have demonstrated the ability of the anatase crystal of TiO2 NP to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the presence of ultraviolet radiation (UVR), a co-exposure likely to occur in aquatic ecosystems. The goal of this study was to examine the photo-induced toxicity of anatase TiO2 NP under natural sunlight to Daphnia magna. D. magna were exposed to a range of UVR intensities and anatase TiO2 concentrations in an outdoor exposure system using the sun as the source of UVR. Different UVR intensities were achieved using UVR opaque and transparent plastics. AnataseTiO(2)-NP demonstrated the reciprocal relationship seen in other phototoxic compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at higher UVR treatments. The calculated 8 h LC50 of anatase TiO2 NP was 139 ppb under full intensity ambient natural sunlight, 778 ppb under 50% natural sunlight, and >500 ppm under 10% natural sunlight. Mortality was also compared between animals allowed to accumulate a body burden of anatase TiO2 for 1 h and organisms whose first exposure to anatase TiO2 aqueous suspensions occurred under UVR. A significantly greater toxic effect was observed in aqueous, low body burden suspensions than that of TiO2 1 h body burdens, which is dissimilar from the model presented in PAHs. Anatase TiO2 presents a unique photo-induced toxic model that is different than that of established phototoxic compounds. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

JOURNAL OF FOOD COMPOSITION AND ANALYSIS				37				67	74		10.1016/j.jfca.2014.09.001			FEB 2015	2015	Iron (Fe) biofortification of staple food crops is carried out through genetic selection and breeding. This study determined the genetic and environmental variation of total seed Fe concentration and food matrix factors (carotenoids, kestose, phytic acid, and phenolics) of field peas (Pisum sativum L.) grown in North Dakota, USA, and the genetic variation of seed Fe levels of commercial field pea cultivars grown under greenhouse conditions with different Fe fertilizer treatments. Total Fe and food matrix factors were measured using previously published methods, and data were presented as dry weight basis. The seed Fe concentration ranged between 45 and 53 mg/kg with a mean concentration of 49 mg/kg. Field peas contained significant concentrations of Fe promoters: xanthophyll (17 mg/100 g), canthaxanthin (68 mg/100 g), beta-carotene (680 mu g/100 g), kestose (1433 mg/100 g), quercetin (51.7 mg/100 g), and ferulic acid (56.1 mg/100 g). The phytic acid concentration of field peas was naturally low (2.7-3.2 mg/g) and the phytic acid:Fe molar ratio ranged between 5.0 and 5.6. CDC Golden and DS Admiral would be suitable genotypes for future Fe biofortification studies. Overall, field pea is a good source of dietary Fe and future studies will address actual Fe bioavailability using animal/human models. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In this paper, design robustness is measured via the variation in the performance function of concern that can be evaluated using reliability analysis. Furthermore, the performance requirements of the system are also evaluated using reliability analysis. Thus, the evaluation of design robustness and the evaluation of performance requirements share common computational steps, referred to herein as computational coupling. This coupling for computational efficiency is a significant feature of the proposed RGD approach. Within the framework of the proposed RGD approach, design robustness, cost efficiency, and performance requirements can be considered simultaneously by means of multiobjective optimization. Furthermore, a practical and efficient procedure is developed for such optimization using a feature resident in a popular spreadsheet program. Through an example of the design of a drilled shaft in clay, the effectiveness of this new RGD approach is demonstrated. The results show that the hard-to-control variability resulting from construction variation, variable loading conditions, model errors, and uncertain geotechnical parameters in the design of drilled shafts in clay can be effectively considered with the proposed RGD approach.

Flow Field Upstream of an Orifice under Fixed Bed and Equilibrium Scour Conditions								JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING				141	2						10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0000960			FEB 2015	2015	Flow behavior upstream of a circular orifice with the invert at the bed level (initially) is investigated under fixed bed and equilibrium scour (mobile bed) conditions. The experiments are performed under three different constant heads and sediment sizes. Longitudinal and vertical components of velocity are measured in the vertical and horizontal planes passing through the center of the orifice. The velocity decay upstream of the orifice (along the centerline of the orifice) is slower for the fixed bed case than for the unbounded orifice. Under equilibrium scour condition, the velocity decay transitions from the velocity profile for the unbounded orifice to the fixed bed condition. The longitudinal velocity profiles in the horizontal plane at different locations upstream of the orifice are found to be similar for both fixed and mobile bed cases. The longitudinal velocity profiles in the vertical plane are also found to be similar for each case. The maximum velocity is found to occur below the centerline of the orifice for both cases. The location and decay of maximum velocity with distance upstream of the orifice are quantified. A three-dimensional flow model is used to simulate the flow behavior upstream of the orifice under fixed bed and equilibrium scour conditions. The model accurately predicts the velocity field upstream of the orifice under both fixed bed and mobile bed conditions.

The Correlation of the Volumetric Wear Rate of Turning Tool Inserts With Carbide Grain Sizes								JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME				137	1					011015	10.1115/1.4028129			FEB 2015	2015	The objective of this paper is to analyze the effect of different carbide grain sizes on the tool material volume worn away from straight tungsten-carbide-cobalt (WC-Co) turning inserts. A previously developed metrology method for assessing the tool material volume worn away from milling inserts is adapted for quantifying the volumetric tool wear (VTW) of turning inserts. Controlled turning experiments are conducted at suitable points in the feed-speed design space for two sets of uncoated inserts having different carbide grain sizes. Three levels of Ti-6Al-4V stock removal volumes (10-cm(3) each) are analyzed. For each insert, the tool material volume worn away (in mm 3) as well as the three-dimensional (3D) wear profile evolution is quantified after each run. Further, the specific volumetric wear rate and the M-ratio (volume of stock removed to VTW) are related to the material removal rate (MRR). The effect of carbide grain size on VTW is examined using scanning electron microscopy and elemental analysis. Finally, the inverse dependence of the M-ratio on MRR enables the definition of actual usable tool life in terms of its efficiency in removing stock, rather than being based on a tool geometry related metric.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1087-1357	1528-8935		WOS:000348121400015		
J	Yebi, Adamu; Ayalew, Beshah								Optimal Layering Time Control for Stepped-Concurrent Radiative Curing Process								JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME				137	1					011020	10.1115/1.4029023			FEB 2015	2015	This paper makes the following main proposals: (1) a stepped-concurrent curing (SCC) approach for making thick parts using ultraviolet (UV) radiative curing and (2) an optimal interlayer hold time control scheme to maximize the benefit of the SCC approach. The SCC approach seeks to reduce cure level deviations across a thick part by introducing new layers before earlier ones cure completely. A model of the UV curing process that includes the coupled cure kinetics and heat transfer is used to motivate the SCC scheme as well as the inherent optimization problem in this process. Then, the SCC process is cast as a hybrid system in which the addition of each layer switches the underlying state space to one with a higher dimension. Minimization of the overall cure deviation is set as the objective of the process and the necessary conditions for the optimal interlayer hold time control sequence are explicitly derived and solved via a steepest descent algorithm. Applications of the proposed scheme to a composite laminate curing process show that the so computed optimal layering time control sequence indeed gives the best performance in terms of closely tracking a target cure level distribution, compared to equal-time SCC or one-shot curing of the whole thick part.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1087-1357	1528-8935		WOS:000348121400020

Evidence for the connection has been based on conceptually and empirically unsound measures of disgust, unpublished research, and indirect findings. This study (N = 283) provides the first direct evidence of a relationship between trait-level food neophobia and traitlevel pathogen disgust. Unexpectedly, we also found that food neophobia varies as a function of sexual disgust and is linked to mating strategy. Using an evolutionary framework, we propose a novel hypothesis that may account for these previously undiscovered findings: the food neophilia as mating display hypothesis. Our discussion centers on future research directions for discriminatively testing this novel hypothesis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This study explored the applicability of fluorescence excitation-emission matrices and parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) for assessing the formation potentials (FPs) of trihalomethanes (THMs) and N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), and the treatability of THM and NDMA precursors in nine drinking water treatment plants. Two humic-like and one tryptophan-like components were identified for the samples using PARAFAC. The total THM FP (TTHM FP) correlated strongly with humic-like component C2 (r = 0.874), while NDMA FP showed a moderate and significant correlation with the tryptophan-like component C3 (r = 0.628). The reduction by conventional treatment was more effective for C2 than C3, and for TTHM FP than NDMA FP. The treatability of DOM and TTHM FP correlated negatively with the absorption spectral slope (S275-295) and biological index (BIX) of the raw water, but it correlated positively with humification index (HIX). Our results demonstrated that PARAFAC components were valuable for assessing DBPs FP in drinking water treatments, and also that the raw water quality could affect the treatment efficiency.

Deceiving entropy based DoS detection								COMPUTERS & SECURITY				48				234	245		10.1016/j.cose.2014.10.013			FEB 2015	2015	Denial of Service (DoS) attacks disable network services for legitimate users. As a result of growing dependence on the Internet by both the general public and service providers, the availability of Internet services has become a concern. While DOS attacks cause inconvenience for users, and revenue loss for service providers; their effects on critical infrastructures like the smart grid and public utilities could be catastrophic. For example, an attack on a smart grid system can cause cascaded power failures and lead to a major blackout. Researchers have proposed approaches for detecting these attacks in the past decade. Anomaly based DoS detection is the most common. The detector uses network traffic statistics; such as the entropy of incoming packet header fields (e.g. source IF addresses or protocol type). It calculates the observed statistical feature and triggers an alarm if an extreme deviation occurs. Entropy features are common in recent DDoS detection publications. They are also one of the most effective features for detecting these attacks. However, intrusion detection systems (IDS) using entropy based detection approaches can be a victim of spoofing attacks. An attacker can sniff the network and calculate background traffic entropy before a (D)DoS attack starts. They can then spoof attack packets to keep the entropy value in the expected range during the attack. This paper explains the vulnerability of entropy based network monitoring systems. We present a proof of concept entropy spoofing attack and show that by exploiting this vulnerability, the attacker can avoid detection or degrade detection performance to an unacceptable level.

A resource information service, which collects resource data and provides resource search functionality for locating desired resources, is a crucial component of the resource sharing system. In addition to resource discovery speed and cost (i.e., efficiency), the ability to accurately locate all satisfying resources (i.e., fidelity) is also an important metric for evaluating service quality. Previously, a number of resource information service systems have been proposed based on Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) that offer scalable key-based lookup functions. However, these systems either achieve high fidelity at low efficiency, or high efficiency at low fidelity. Moreover, some systems have limited flexibility by only providing exact-matching services or by describing a resource using a pre-defined list of attributes. This paper presents a resource information service that offers high efficiency and fidelity without restricting resource expressiveness, while also providing a similar-matching service. Extensive simulation and PlanetLab experimental results show that the proposed service outperforms other services in terms of efficiency, fidelity, and flexibility; it dramatically reduces overhead and yields significant enhancements in efficiency and fidelity.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0018-9340	1557-9956		WOS:000348053400005

CPS applications, such as healthcare monitoring, may involve many users and objects scattered over a wide area. One critical function of CPS is object search in the physical world through the cyber sphere that enables interaction between the cyber and physical spheres. Some of the previously proposed physical object search engines use RFID tracking, and others collect the information of object locations into a hierarchical centralized server. The difficulty of widely deploying RFID devices, the centralized search, and the need for periodical location information collection prevent CPS from achieving higher scalability and efficiency. To deal with this problem, we propose a Social-aware distributed Cyber-Physical human-centric Search engine (SCPS) that leverages the social network formed by wireless device users for object search. Without requiring periodical location information collection, SCPS locates objects held by users based on the routine user movement pattern. Moreover, using a social-aware Bayesian network, it can accurately predict the users' locations even at the occurrence of exceptional (i.e., non-routine) events (e.g., raining) that break user movement pattern. Thus, SCPS is more advantageous than all previous social network based works which assume that user behaviors always follow a certain pattern. Further, SCPS conducts the search in a fully distributed manner by relying on a distributed hash table (DHT) structure. As a result, SCPS achieves high scalability, efficiency and location accuracy. Extensive real-trace driven simulation results show the superior performance of SCPS compared to other representative search methods including a hierarchical centralized method, a decentralized method, and two social network based methods. The results also show the effectiveness of different components of SCPS.									3	2	0	0	0	5			0018-9340	1557-9956		WOS:000348053400017

The impact of perceived customer delight on the frontline employee								JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH				68	2			433	441		10.1016/j.jbusres.2014.06.005			FEB 2015	2015	A plethora of research has investigated the impact of the frontline employee on the customer, with the consensus that employees can have a tremendous impact on the customer. What remains to be discovered is the extent to which this relationship exists in the reverse. Utilizing broaden-and-build and emotional contagion theories, this study suggests that employee perceptions of a specific customer emotion (delight) have an impact on the frontline employee. Specifically, results from a structural equations model reveal that employee perceptions of customer delight lead to employee positive affect, which in turn positively influences commitment and job satisfaction as well as creates stronger external representation behaviors, internal influence behaviors, and service delivery behaviors from the employee. These findings contribute new evidence to the debate of the viability of providing customer delight and extend our knowledge beyond emotional contagion in explaining how positive customer emotions manifest in employees.

Influence of physicochemical properties of silver nanoparticles on mast cell activation and degranulation								TOXICOLOGY IN VITRO				29	1			195	203		10.1016/j.tiv.2014.10.008			FEB 2015	2015	Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are increasingly being incorporated into products for their antimicrobial properties. This has resulted in increased human exposures and the possibility of adverse health effects. Mast cells orchestrate allergic immune responses through degranulation and release of pre-formed mediators. Little data exists on understanding interactions of AgNPs with mast cells and the properties that influence activation and degranulation. Using bone marrow-derived mast cells and AgNPs of varying physicochemical properties we tested the hypothesis that AgNP physicochemical properties influence mast cell degranulation and osteopontin production. AgNPs evaluated included spherical 20 nm and 110 nm suspended in either polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) or citrate, Ag plates suspended in PVP of diameters between 40-60 nm or 100-130 nm, and Ag nanowires suspended in PVP with thicknesses <100 nm and length up to 2 mu m. Mast cell responses were found to be dependent on the physicochemical properties of the AgNP. Further, we determined a role for scavenger receptor B1 in AgNP-induced mast cell respons8. Mast cell degranulation was not dependent on AgNP dissolution but was prevented by tyrosine lcinase inhibitor pretreatment. This study suggests that exposure to AgNPs may elicit adverse mast cell responses that could contribute to the initiation or exacerbation of allergic disease. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Angus bulls were allotted to treatment (Day 0) and grazed E+ or E- for 155 days. Treatment-by-day interaction was significant (P < 0.05) for serum PRL concentrations with E+treated bulls exhibiting reduced PRL values compared with E control bulls, but no differences were observed for serum testosterone concentrations (P > 0.05). Further, bulls on the E+ treatment exhibited decreased total gain, average daily gain, and body weight by Day 140 (P < 0.05) compared with the E-bulls. Rump muscle depth was lower because the treatment in bulls grazing E+ compared with E-(P < 0.05) and intramuscular fat in the E-bulls compared with the E+ group was higher by Day 155 (P < 0.05). Analysis of ejaculates showed significant treatment x day effects for sperm concentration with lower values observed for bulls on the E+ treatment (P < 0.05). The percent normal morphology was reduced in ejaculates from E+ bulls compared with E-bulls (P < 0.05), and the difference was due to an increase in abnormal sperm present in the E+ ejaculates from Day 84 to 140 (P < 0.05). In addition, spermatozoa motility and progressive motility were decreased on thawing in semen samples from E+ bulls compared with E- bulls (P < 0.05). (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

J	Shen, Haiying; Li, Ze; Yu, Lei								A P2P-Based Market-Guided Distributed Routing Mechanism for High-Throughput Hybrid Wireless Networks								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MOBILE COMPUTING				14	2			245	260		10.1109/TMC.2014.2320255			FEB 2015	2015	In a hybrid wireless network that combines a mobile ad-hoc network and an infrastructure network, efficient and reliable data routing is important for high throughput. Existing routing schemes that simply combine ad-hoc and infrastructure routings inherit the drawbacks of ad-hoc routing including congestion and high overhead for route discovery and maintenance. Although current reputation systems help increase routing reliability, they rely on local information exchanges between nodes to evaluate node reputations, so they are not sufficiently effective and efficient. A challenge here is if we can coordinately develop an efficient routing algorithm and effective cooperation incentives for reliable routing. To handle this challenge, this paper presents a peer-to-peer (P2P)-based Market-guided Distributed Routing mechanism (MDR). MDR takes advantage of widespread base stations to coordinately realize highly efficient data routing, and effective reputation management and trading market management for reliable data routing. The packets from a source node are distributively transmitted to base stations directly or indirectly, and then they are transmitted to the destination. The base stations form a P2P structure for reputation collection and querying to avoid local information exchanges, and for managing the service transactions between nodes in the trading market. By leveraging the single-relay transmission feature, base stations can monitor the actual transmitted packets of relay nodes to more accurately and efficiently evaluate their reputations and execute trading market management, as well as detect falsely reported reputation information. We further propose market-based policies to strengthen cooperation incentives.

In Other News: Negotiating a Shifting Notion of Newsworthiness Through Amateur Web Video								PLARIDEL				12	1			141	157					FEB 2015	2015	This paper attempts to open the discussion on the changing notion of news among Filipino broadcast audiences and the broadcast media gatekeepers through the use of user-generated content. Several versions of singular events are allowed to be told, thus subverting the news media's monopoly of the telling of events. This paper looks at some of the web videos that made the jump from sites like YouTube and Facebook, and assesses their newsworthiness according to those set by the mass media. Are audiences and producers influencing a change in the criteria of newsworthiness? Through a rhetorical analysis, this paper proposes a switch to the "little narratives" often regarded as novelty by corporate media, and argues for the quotidian that exist as story fragments; the private lives of individuals contribute to the conceptualization of news from the others' perspective.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1656-2534			WOS:000374243000008

Rethinking Behavioral Health Processes by Using Design for Six Sigma								PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES				66	2			112	114		10.1176/appi.ps.201400384			FEB 2015	2015	Clinical evidence-based practices are strongly encouraged and commonly utilized in the behavioral health community. However, evidence-based practices that are related to quality improvement processes, such as Design for Six Sigma, are often not used in behavioral health care. This column describes the unique partnership formed between a behavioral health care provider in the greater Pittsburgh area, a non-profit oversight and monitoring agency for behavioral health services, and academic researchers. The authors detail how the partnership used the multistep process outlined in Design for Six Sigma to completely redesign the provider's intake process. Implementation of the redesigned process increased access to care, decreased bad debt and uncollected funds, and improved cash flow-while consumer satisfaction remained high.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1075-2730	1557-9700		WOS:000370552100005	25642607	
J	Ali, Gibran; Wagner, John; Moline, David; Schweisinger, Todd								Energy harvesting from atmospheric variations - Theory and test								RENEWABLE ENERGY				74				528	535		10.1016/j.renene.2014.08.033			FEB 2015	2015	The last two decades have offered a dramatic rise in the use of digital technologies such as wireless sensor networks that require small isolated power supplies. Energy harvesting, a method to gather energy from ambient sources including sunlight, vibrations, heat, etc., has provided some success in powering these systems. One of the unexplored areas of energy harvesting is the use of atmospheric temperature variations to obtain usable energy. This paper investigates an innovative device to extract energy from atmospheric variations using ethyl chloride filled mechanical bellows. The apparatus consists of a bellows filled with ethyl chloride working against a spring in a closed and controlled environment. The bellows expand/contract depending upon the ambient temperature and the energy harvested is calculated as a function of the bellows' length. The experiments showed that 6 J of energy may be hgrvested for a 23 degrees C change in temperature. The numerical results closely correlated to the experimental data with a deviation of 1%. In regions with high diurnal temperature variation, such an apparatus may yield approximately 250 mu W depending on the ambient temperature range. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Ciftyuerek, Engin; McMillen, Colin D.; Sabolsky, Katarzyna; Sabolsky, Edward M.								Platinum-zirconium composite thin film electrodes for high-temperature micro-chemical sensor applications								SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL				207				206	215		10.1016/j.snb.2014.10.037			FEB 2015	2015	Stable metal interconnect thin films are critical in the development of various micro-machined devices that may operate continuously at elevated temperatures. The main objective of this work was to investigate the microstructural and electrical stability of a functionally gradient platinum (Pt)-zirconium (Zr) composite thin film electrode designed for resistive-type chemical sensors. Thin film electrodes were fabricated using a DC magnetron sputtering process. Zirconium was used as both the conventional adhesion promoter and the Pt grain modifier within the bulk electrode microstructure. The thin film deposition was completed on highly polished alumina substrates at 200 degrees C. The various composite Pt thin flilms were further annealed at 1200 degrees C after deposition for 1-24 h for rapid evaluation of the microstructure stability. This temperature was chosen since the electrodes are expected to operate beyond 1000 degrees C for high-temperature MEMS applications. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive Xray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were conducted to characterize the alterations in chemistry, microstructure and distribution of the constituent elements through the film thickness. The electrical resistivity of the as-deposited and thermally processed Pt thin films was measured by utilizing a van der Pauw's four-point probe technique. The work identified a Zr/Zr + Pt/Pt composite thin film with the 525 nm total film thickness that demonstrated resistivity <5.08 x 10(-7) Omega m after being processed to 1200 degrees C for 15 h. A lift-off technique was finally used to produce a micro-electrode patterns with the optimized film structure for high-temperature applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A 70 mu m reflection-mode fiber-optic micro-pH sensor was designed and fabricated by dip-coating thin layer of organically modified aerogel onto a tapered spherical probe head. A pH sensitive fluorescent dye 2',7'-Bis (2-carbonylethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) was employed and covalently bonded within the aerogel networks. By tuning the alkoxide mixing ratio and adjusting hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) priming procedure, the sensor can be optimized to have high stability and pH sensing ability. The in vitro real-time sensing capability was then demonstrated in a simple spectroscopic way, and showed linear measurement responses with a pH resolution up to an average of 0.049 pH unit within a narrow, but biological meaningful pH range of 6.12-7.81. Its novel characterizations of high spatial resolution, reflection mode operation, fast response and high stability, great linear response within biological meaningful pH range and high pH resolutions, make this pH probe a very cost-effective tool for chemical/biological sensing, especially within the single cell level research field.

J	Yang, Fan; Wang, Kuang-Ching; Huang, Yong								Selecting Data Transmission Method for Sensor Networks With Deterministic Spatial Channel Properties								IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL				15	2			917	927		10.1109/JSEN.2014.2356598			FEB 2015	2015	Wireless sensor radios are particularly prone to a radio channel impairment due to a simple communication circuitry. Persistent impairment can cause serious problems to sensors that must continuously or repeatedly reside in locations with deterministic channel properties caused by the surrounding spatial structure. Capturing such channel properties with traditional statistical models alone is cumbersome and ineffective. A new modeling framework based on receiver-measured packet error rates expressed using two surface roughness parameters, namely the amplitude and spacing parameters, is proposed to represent the key properties of a channel error profile. A case study on a rotating machine environment is presented. Experimental results confirmed the adequacy of the proposed model and the resulting improved transmission performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1530-437X	1558-1748		WOS:000345905900016

The uniform phase dispersion was validated using SEM-EDS and FIB-SEM tomography. Using reconstructed 3D images of samples sintered at 1200 and 1300 C, the effect of sintering on phase connectivity, triple phase boundary (TPB) density and phase tortuosity was explored. The higher sintering temperature resulted in lower TPB density and, less open pore volume but decreased tortuosity for both the LSM and YSZ due to densification of the structure at high temperatures. Due to the unique double-sided morphology of the freeze-cast walls and the benefits gained from less tortuous percolation paths, a decrease in TPB density and open porosity from elevated sintering temperatures may not degrade the electrochemical performance as much as it would for a standard isotropic microstructure.

Family 2 mismatch-specific uracil DNA glycosylase (MUG) from Escherichia coli is known to exhibit glycosylase activity on three mismatched base pairs, T/U, G/U and C/U. Family 1 uracil N-glycosylase (UNG) from E. coli is an extremely efficient enzyme that can remove uracil from any uracil-containing base pairs including the A/U base pair. Here, we report the identification of an important structural determinant that underlies the functional difference between MUG and UNG. Substitution of a Lys residue at position 68 with Asn in MUG not only accelerates the removal of uracil from mismatched base pairs but also enables the enzyme to gain catalytic activity on A/U base pairs. Binding and kinetic analysis demonstrate that the MUG-K68N substitution results in enhanced ground state binding and transition state interactions. Molecular modeling reveals that MUG-K68N, UNG-N123 and family 5 Thermus thermophiles UDGb-A111N can form bidentate hydrogen bonds with the N3 and O4 moieties of the uracil base. Genetic analysis indicates the gain of function for A/U base pairs allows the MUG-K68Nmutant to remove uracil incorporated into the genome during DNA replication. The implications of this study in the origin of life are discussed.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0305-1048	1362-4962		WOS:000350209000039	25550433

J	Bibo, Amin; Alhadidi, Ali H.; Daqaq, Mohammed F.								Exploiting a nonlinear restoring force to improve the performance of flow energy harvesters								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS				117	4					045103	10.1063/1.4906463			JAN 28 2015	2015	This paper investigates employing a nonlinear restoring force to improve the performance of flow energy harvesters (FEHs). To that end, a galloping FEH possessing a quartic potential energy function of the form V = 1/2 mu y(2) vertical bar 1/4 gamma y(4) is considered. This potential function is used to model either a softening (mu > 0, gamma < 0), hardening (mu > 0, gamma > 0), or bi-stable (mu < 0, gamma > 0) restoring force. A physics-based model of the harvester is obtained assuming piezoelectric transduction and a quasi-steady flow field. The model is validated against experimental data and used to obtain a closed-form solution of the response by employing a multiple scaling perturbation analysis using the Jacobi elliptic functions. The attained solution is subsequently used to investigate the influence of the nonlinearity on the performance of the harvester and to illustrate how to optimize the restoring force in order to maximize the output power for given design conditions and airflow parameters. Specifically, it is shown that for similar design parameters and equal magnitudes of mu, and gamma, a bi-stable energy harvester outperforms all other configurations as long as the inter-well motions are activated. On the other hand, if the motion of the bi-stable harvester is limited to a single well, then a harvester incorporating a softening nonlinear restoring force outperforms all other configurations. Furthermore, when comparing two FEHs incorporating the same type of restoring force at the optimal load and similar values of mu, then the FEH with the smaller gamma is shown to provide higher output power levels.

The influence of photoperiod and exogenous applications of plant growth regulators were investigated in order to identify factors that could induce the formation of crown buds earlier in the season. The transfer of plant material to a naturally occurring short photoperiod increased the number of crown buds 5-fold compared to a long photoperiod. Application of gibberellic acid inhibited bud formation under all photoperiod regimes investigated. When applied under the normally inhibiting long photoperiod regime, ethephon tripled the number of crown buds and shoots compared to the control, with the promotional effects doubled when paclobutrazol or thidiazuron was also applied. When exogenous growth regulators, that promoted crown bud formation under a long photoperiod regime were applied under the naturally occurring short photoperiod regime, buds formed on storage roots instead of the normal position on the transition zone between the shoot and roots. The change in location of crown buds with growth regulator application and photoperiod regime is discussed in terms of changes in sink strength and carbohydrate accumulation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Critical analysis of lattice thermal conductivity of half-Heusler alloys using variations of Callaway model								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS				117	3					035706	10.1063/1.4906225			JAN 21 2015	2015	Half-Heusler alloys have been the focus of recent experimental research as emerging thermoelectric materials. Particular attention has been focused on the MNiSn (M = Ti, Zr, and Hf) alloys with substitutions made to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity and enhance the electrical transport properties. The effect of these substitutions on the relaxation time of phonon scattering in the material, and the impact on the lattice thermal conductivity, was investigated with a focus on modeling the experimental data. A modified Callaway model was used to describe experimental data, which were then compared to theoretical results predicted using phonon scattering by mass fluctuation and strain field models. The correlation between the coefficients obtained with experimental fits and theoretical models shows a predictable and systematic relationship between alloy composition and the thermal conductivity. In addition, the role of the normal (N) phonon-phonon scattering process is investigated following a recent theoretical study that indicated that the effect of N-process was underestimated in original Callaway's model. A comparison of the lattice thermal conductivity behavior using the phonon relaxation times in the original Callaway's model and the newly suggested theoretical model by Allen for the normal process is presented and discussed.

The IGRB comprises all extragalactic emissions too faint or too diffuse to be resolved in a given survey, as well as any residual Galactic foregrounds that are approximately isotropic. The first IGRB measurement with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Fermi) used 10 months of sky-survey data and considered an energy range between 200 MeV and 100 GeV. Improvements in event selection and characterization of cosmic-ray backgrounds, better understanding of the diffuse Galactic emission (DGE), and a longer data accumulation of 50 months allow for a refinement and extension of the IGRB measurement with the LAT, now covering the energy range from 100 MeV to 820 GeV. The IGRB spectrum shows a significant high-energy cutoff feature and can be well described over nearly four decades in energy by a power law with exponential cutoff having a spectral index of 2.32 +/- 0.02 and a break energy of (279 +/- 52) GeV using our baseline DGE model. The total intensity attributed to the IGRB is (7.2 +/- 0.6) x 10(-6) cm(-2) s(-1) sr(-1) above 100 MeV, with an additional +15%/-30% systematic uncertainty due to the Galactic diffuse foregrounds.									111	1	0	1	0	112			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000348214500084

The study focused on a preform with a cross-section geometry that contains 36 holes arranged in three hexagonal rings. Symmetry allowed for the modeling of a 30 degrees portion of the cross section, which included five holes within this reduced computational domain. The simulations took into account flow through an array of 13 feed holes, flow along five circular pins to create the holes, exit from the die, and the development of a constant profile for the cross section of the preform. The primary concern in the study was exploring the capacity of the model to reproduce the observed distortion of the extruded holes, i.e., the difference between the holes that develop and the negative of the pin arrangement, by taking into account the complexity of the flow. The key features that describe the model are viscous flow, uniform temperature, interface slip using the Navier friction model, and the assumption of a steady-state solution. Validation of the procedure was based on a comparison between the predicted cross section and an actual preform. The results show that distortion of the holes is rather sensitive to the level of friction, which provides insight into reducing the magnitude of distortion in future experimental work.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0733-8724	1558-2213		WOS:000349624200006

High porosity scintillating polymer resins for ionizing radiation sensor applications								POLYMER				56		SI		271	279		10.1016/j.polymer.2014.10.076			JAN 15 2015	2015	Due to their high sorption capacity, nanoporous polymer resins can be used as an active material for ionizing radiation sensor applications. This contribution reports on the molecular design and synthesis of scintillating styrene-based resins with controlled bead size, porosity and surface functionality. In a working sensor device, the adsorption of radioactive analyte species on the resin can be monitored via incorporation of specially designed fluor molecules to convert ionizing radiation (specifically, alpha-particles and beta-particles) into light. Porous polystyrene (PS) and poly(4-methylstyrene) resins of various compositions and structure were synthesized via suspension polymerization technique. 1,4-Bis(4-methyl-5-phenyl-oxazol-2-yl)benzene (DM-POPOP) was incorporated into the resin by adding it to the dispersed phase. Polymerization conditions were adjusted to achieve a desirable range of polymer beads size and porosity (pore size distribution, specific surface area). The porosity of the resin beads could be controlled by the type and concentration of the porogen, as well as by the degree of PS matrix crosslinking with divinylbenzene. Three different porogens (toluene, n-heptane or span-80 nonionic surfactant) were used to achieve a broad variation of the nanopore size distribution within the same matrix. The structure, porosity and optical fluorescence properties of the synthesized PS beads were analyzed with nitrogen adsorption porosimetry, optical/UV confocal, scanning electron and helium ion microscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy. A broad variation of the pore size distribution, specific surface area and optical properties within the same system were demonstrated. Findings from this study can be used for the development of more efficient environmental sensors to monitor contamination of ground water with trace amounts of radioactive materials.

The ZnO nanorods are regrown when zinc acetate dihydrate and zinc chloride (ZnCl2) are used as the solvent, because these generate ZnCl2 vapor. The near-band-edge emission intensity of the ZnO nanorods was enhanced through the VC-FTFA method, increasing significantly by a factor of 56 compared to that of ZnO films annealed in open air at 700 degrees C.

Electrokinetic flow-based continuous particle separation has thus far been realized primarily by the use of particle dielectrophoresis induced in constricted and/or curved microchannels. We develop in this work a new electrokinetic method that exploits the wall-induced non-inertial lift in a straight uniform microchannel to continuously separate particles by intrinsic properties (e.g., size and surface charge). Such an electrically originated lift force arises from the asymmetric electric field distribution around a particle nearby a planar dielectric wall. We demonstrate this method through separating both a binary and ternary mixture of dispersed polystyrene microspheres by size in a T-shaped microchannel. A semi-analytical model is also developed to simulate and understand the particle separation process. The predicted particle trajectories in the entire microchannel agree reasonably well with the experimental measurements.									7	0	0	1	0	7			0743-7463			WOS:000348085900077	25521509

Lunapark stabilizes nascent three-way junctions in the endoplasmic reticulum								PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA				112	2			418	423		10.1073/pnas.1423026112/-/DCSupplemental			JAN 13 2015	2015	The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) consists of a polygonal network of sheets and tubules interconnected by three-way junctions. This network undergoes continual remodeling through competing processes: the branching and fusion of tubules forms new three-way junctions and new polygons, and junction sliding and ring closure leads to polygon loss. However, little is known about the machinery required to generate and maintain junctions. We previously reported that yeast Lnp1 localizes to ER junctions, and that loss of Lnp1 leads to a collapsed, densely reticulated ER network. In mammalian cells, only approximately half the junctions contain Lnp1. Here we use live cell imaging to show that mammalian Lnp1 (mLnp1) affects ER junction mobility and hence network dynamics. Three-way junctions with mLnp1 are less mobile than junctions without mLnp1. Newly formed junctions that acquire mLnp1 remain stable within the ER network, whereas nascent junctions that fail to acquire mLnp1 undergo rapid ring closure. These findings imply that mLnp1 plays a key role in stabilizing nascent three-way ER junctions.									16	0	0	15	0	16			0027-8424			WOS:000347732300046	25548161

Portraiture is a method of inquiry that blends art and science by combining the empirical aspects of inquiry with beauty and aesthetic properties. This method encompasses all aspects of a research study, including protocol, data collection and analysis, and presentation of findings. To examine the viability of portraiture as methodology for science education researchers, we provided two portraits of science teachers and their classrooms to illustrate how context played a significant role in teachers' experiences and how it influenced their classroom pedagogy. The implications of this work show how portraiture can support deep, dynamic understanding of context in science education. This work also illustrates the importance of attending to relationships and voice, both of which are often lacking in science education research.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0951-8398	1366-5898		WOS:000354434200002

Literature argues that human error contributes to more than half of occupational incidents and could be directly impacted by effective training programs. This paper reviews the current safety training status in the US construction industry. Results from the review evidence the gap between the status and industry expectation on safety. To narrow this gap, this paper demonstrates the development and utilisation of a training program that is based on virtual reality (VR) simulation. The VR-based safety training program can offer a safe working environment where users can effectively rehearse tasks with electrical hazards and ultimately promote their abilities for electrical hazard cognition and intervention. Its visualisation and simulation can also remove the training barriers caused by electricity's features of invisibility and dangerousness.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1745-7300	1745-7319		WOS:000351835400009	24471426

Next, I amend this perspective with Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari's notion that "the concept is not object but territory" (What is Philosophy? (New York: Verso, 2003) 101). That is, rather than looking at convulsive bodies as objects through which actors (another form of object) struggle, I approach convulsions as evidencing acts of territorialization. Instead of a corporeal object over which actors struggle for ownership, this perspective reframes convulsions as a process of space-making that is constitutive of the space-makers. Amending Foucault's take on convulsions with Deleuze and Guattari's notion of territory allows for analysis of "techno-horror" popular entertainments as constitutive processes in the unfolding of new reproductive masculine subjectivities.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0969-725X	1469-2899		WOS:000350964600001

However, unstable network conditions impose great challenges in guaranteeing data accuracy, which is essential for reliable state estimation of the physical phenomena. For underlying sensor networks, without efficiently resolving congestion in data transmission, packet loss at congested nodes can considerably increase the estimation error. However, previous congestion control schemes relying on reducing transmitted data samples also increase the estimation error. Thus, we propose a Congestion-Adaptive Data Collection scheme (CADC) to efficiently resolve the network congestion while guaranteeing the overall data estimation accuracy. CADC mitigates congestion by adaptive lossy compression with guarantee that a given overall data estimation error bound is satisfied. Besides, since a CPS application may have different priorities for different data items, we further propose a weighted CADC scheme such that the data with higher priority has less distortion. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our CADC schemes.					12th Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking - Workshops (SECON Workshops)12th Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking - Workshops (SECON Workshops)	JUN 22-25, 2015JUN 22-25, 2015	IEEEIEEE	Seattle, WASeattle, WA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4673-7331-9	WOS:000378319400010

Since nodes are sparsely distributed in separated areas and are intermittently disconnected in DTNs, it is difficult to achieve high data availability in file sharing. Many previous methods enhance file availability in DTNs through file replication. However, there has been no file replication method that tries to reduce data loss in correlated node failures, which however are common in wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a distributed file replication method (called MobileCopy) in DTNs, which aims to achieve low probability of totally losing a file at the expense of having a high number of impacted files in an individual large-scale correlated node failure. MobileCopy is designed for community-based file sharing systems. It has two main components: i) data loss resistant and popularity aware file replication, and ii) distributed hash table (DHT)-based file replica indexing. MobileCopy considers file popularity to determine the number of replicas of a file in each community. Through limiting the possible combination of candidate replica holders, MobileCopy greatly reduces the probability of node failures that will lead to data loss, i.e., losing all replicas of a file. Moreover, MobileCopy enables nodes to efficiently store and fetch the placement information of file replicas for efficient file searching. Extensive trace-driven experiments show that MobileCopy is robust against correlated node failures and efficient in file sharing in comparison with previous methods.					12th Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking - Workshops (SECON Workshops)12th Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking - Workshops (SECON Workshops)	JUN 22-25, 2015JUN 22-25, 2015	IEEEIEEE	Seattle, WASeattle, WA	1	0	0	0	0	1					978-1-4673-7331-9	WOS:000378319400011

The previous works characterize its data deliverability in WSNs by the probability of all nodes successfully sending their data to the base station. Their analysis, however, neither provides the information of the quantitative relation between successful data delivery ratio and transmission power of sensor nodes nor considers the impact of the network congestion or link collision on the data deliverability. To address these problems, in this paper, we characterize the data deliverability of greedy routing by the ratio of successful data transmissions from sensors to the base station. We introduce eta-guaranteed delivery which means that the ratio of successful data deliveries is not less than., and study the relationship between the transmission power of sensors and the probability of achieving eta-guaranteed delivery. Furthermore, with considering the effect of network congestion and link collision, we provide a more precise and full characterization for the deliverability of greedy routing. Extensive simulation and real-world experimental results show the correctness and tightness of the upper bound of the smallest transmission power for achieving eta-guaranteed delivery.					12th Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking - Workshops (SECON Workshops)12th Annual IEEE International Conference on Sensing, Communication, and Networking - Workshops (SECON Workshops)	JUN 22-25, 2015JUN 22-25, 2015	IEEEIEEE	Seattle, WASeattle, WA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4673-7331-9	WOS:000378319400044

These inter-datacenter transfers are charged by ISPs under the dominant percentile-based charging models. In order to minimize the payment costs, existing works aim to keep the traffic on each link under the charging volume. However, these methods cannot fully utilize each link's available bandwidth capacity, and may increase the charging volumes. To further reduce the bandwidth payment cost by fully utilizing link bandwidth, we propose an economical and deadline-driven video flow scheduling system, called EcoFlow. Considering different video flows have different transmission deadlines, EcoFlow transmits videos in the order of their deadline tightness and postpones the deliveries of later-deadline videos to later time slots so that the charging volume at current time interval will not increase. The flows that are expected to miss their deadlines are divided into subflows to be rerouted to other under-utilized links in order to meet their deadlines without increasing charging volumes. Experimental results on EC2 show that compared to existing methods, EcoFlow achieves the least bandwidth costs for cloud providers.

Results demonstrate that a substantial proportion find utility in the applications. Interaction effects regarding B2B managers are particularly noteworthy, as no prior research has shown that B2B managers are significantly and far more engaged with social CRM than other sales representatives. The frequency and extent of social CRM usage varies based on the specific tools used and the stage of the selling process.

Resolving discrepancies in the literature, we propose that authentic pride operates as an antecedent of psychological ownership, whereas hubristic pride strengthens the effect of psychological ownership on outcomes such as economic valuation and word-of-mouth. We further enrich the conceptualization by considering the moderating effects of the technology consumption context (public vs. private) as well as consumers' perceptions of situation strength (strong vs. weak behavioral constraints).									9	0	0	1	0	9			1069-6679	1944-7175		WOS:000388597600005

Battery-Double Layer Capacitor (DLC) is one of such HESS that is being adopted for different applications such as vehicle propulsion, auxiliary power unit and renewable energy storage. Real-time estimation of the states and parameters of such HESS is crucial for safe, efficient and optimal operation. In this paper, an online state-parameter estimation scheme is presented based on the electrical and thermal dynamics of the battery and DLC. The estimation scheme consists of two separate state-parameter estimators for battery and DLC each of which exploits a cascaded observer-based structure. The observers are designed based on sliding mode methodology. Theoretical verification of the overall state-parameter estimation is provided using Lyapunov's argument. Effectiveness of the scheme is verified via simulation studies.					54th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)54th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	DEC 15-18, 2015DEC 15-18, 2015	Kozo Keikaku Engn; MathWorks; Springer; CYBERNET Syst; Mitsubishi Elect; Soc Ind & Appl Math; Altair; Int Journal Automat & Comp; IEEE CAA Journal Automatica Sinica; Cogent Engn; Now; IHI; IEEEKozo Keikaku Engn; MathWorks; Springer; CYBERNET Syst; Mitsubishi Elect; Soc Ind & Appl Math; Altair; Int Journal Automat & Comp; IEEE CAA Journal Automatica Sinica; Cogent Engn; Now; IHI; IEEE	Osaka, JAPANOsaka, JAPAN	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4799-7886-1	WOS:000381554500127

A trust and self-confidence based autonomy allocation scheme is proposed based on objective and unbiased measures of human-robot collaboration (HRC) systems. We also provide analytical tools to evaluate the long-term effects of the proposed allocation scheme on the overall robot performance and human workload. Experiments are designed to test and show that the proposed trust and self-confidence based allocation scheme can capture human autonomy allocation pattern. Furthermore, we develop a pattern correction algorithm using nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to help the human gradually adapt to a modified autonomy allocation pattern for better overall performance.

RSC advances				5	127			105498	105498					2015-Jan-1	2015	Nanoparticles (NPs) have been experimentally found to either promote or inhibit amyloid aggregation of proteins, but the molecular mechanisms for such complex behaviors remain unknown. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated the effects of varying the strength of nonspecific NP-protein attraction on amyloid aggregation of a model protein, the amyloid-beta peptide implicated in Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, with increasing NP-peptide attraction, amyloid aggregation on the NP surface was initially promoted due to increased local protein concentration on the surface and destabilization of the folded state. However, further increase of NP-peptide attraction decreased the stability of amyloid fibrils and reduced their lateral diffusion on the NP surface necessary for peptide conformational changes and self-association, thus prohibiting amyloid aggregation. Moreover, we found that the relative concentration between protein and NPs also played an important role in amyloid aggregation. With a high NP/protein ratio, NPs that intrinsically promote protein aggregation may display an inhibitive effect by depleting the proteins in solution while having a low concentration of the proteins on each NP's surface. Our coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation study offers a molecular mechanism for delineating the contrasting and seemingly conflicting effects of NP-protein attraction on amyloid aggregation and highlights the potential of tailoring anti-aggregation nanomedicine against amyloid diseases.									0	0	0	0	0	0						MEDLINE:26989481	26989481

IEEE					Continuum Robots for Space Applications Based on Layer-Jamming Scales with Stiffening Capability								2015 IEEE AEROSPACE CONFERENCE														2015	2015	Continuum robots, which have continuous mechanical structures comparable to the flexibility in elephant trunks and octopus arms, have been primarily geared toward the medical and defense communities. In space, however, NASA projects these robots to have a place in irregular inspection routines. The inherent compliance and bending of these continuum arms are especially suitable for inspection in obstructed spaces to ensure proper equipment functionality. In this paper, we propose a new solution that improves on the functionality of previous continuum robots, via a novel mechanical scaly layer-jamming design. Layer-jamming assisted continuum arms have previously required pneumatic sources for actuation, which limit their portability and usage in aerospace applications. This paper combines the compliance of continuum arms and stiffness modulation of the layer jamming mechanism to design a new hybrid layer jamming continuum arm. The novel design uses an electromechanical actuation which eliminates the pneumatic actuation therefore making it compact and portable.

J	Abegaz, Tamirat; Dillon, Edward; Gilbert, Juan E.						Ahram, T; Karwowski, W; Schmorrow, D		Exploring Affective Reaction During User Interaction With Colors And Shapes								6TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON APPLIED HUMAN FACTORS AND ERGONOMICS (AHFE 2015) AND THE AFFILIATED CONFERENCES, AHFE 2015								5253	5260		10.1016/j.promfg.2015.07.602			2015	2015	The interactive structure of software applications involves multiple facets of graphic design and information architecture. A user's affective reaction can be influenced while interacting with these applications. From a user's experience (UX) point of view, the affective reaction generated from users in some cases can be considered of an equal or even higher importance than the design and architecture of a software application. When describing affective reaction within the context of user experience, a change in the users' attitude could also influence a change in their behavior while interacting with certain applications. More importantly, this behavior change could impact the users' quality of decision-making during interaction. Affective reactions can be invoked and influenced through the incorporation of visual emotional stimuli. Example visual emotional stimuli include colors, facial expressions, movie scenes, and shapes of objects. Amongst these particular stimuli, colors and shapes can be considered of a lower level design than facial expressions and movie scenes. Previous studies have provided mixed findings regarding an individual's affective reaction when exposed to colors and shapes. However, this article investigates the potential of employing such elements as viable alternatives to higher level stimuli such as facial expression and movie scenes. A study was conducted to explore affective reaction using colors, shapes, and their combinations to serve as visual emotional stimuli. The objective was to understand the possibility of using lower level design alternatives for manipulating users' affective reactions by comparing colors and shapes in the form of textual properties, abstract polygonal shapes, and the combination of both respectively. The study consisted of thirteen participants who were exposed to these design elements in their variety while interacting with a simple computer application. For measurement and analysis, one-way repeated measure ANOVAs were employed to determine the effectiveness of these design elements and their mood induction capabilities during user interaction. The results from this study indicated that the presence of colors, shapes, and their combinations were able to invoke certain affective reactions without the participants even noticing their presence. More specifically, this study revealed that certain colors and shapes generated a more positive affective reaction while others induced either a more neutral or less positive emotion from the participants. This study also demonstrated that these particular design elements have high visceral effects that could be used as potential alternatives to more traditional and higher level visual emotional stimuli in order to influence a user's affective reaction.

This paper discusses an experiment that evaluated the system's speech recognition at various levels of background noise. An approach to simulate realistic background noise in a controlled environment is described. This approach helped mimic a voter voting in a precinct. The goal of the experiment was to establish a threshold for when distortion occurs and speech recognition accuracy declines. The signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) between the volumes were recorded and the system's accuracy was tested. The result was a suggested threshold of a SNR equal to 1.44 to attain 90% system accuracy. The next phase of this project is to test the level of system interference from ambient noise in an actual voting precinct.

The purpose is to support the decision about their levels of automation (LoA) following a dedicated modelling language labeled ASML offering a better visibility about processes design and analyses. ASML provides an easy way of defining several systems alternatives based on an initial ASML model representing assembly motions using a standard vocabulary and structured executing architectures. The correlation of early phase modelling with time estimating proposed in this paper to support LoA decision is up to us new to the literature. The approach of modelling and time estimating was tested on assembly examples and a computerized tool was also developed and tested. Several related applications such as processes time performances evaluating, time savings, productivity assessment, lines balancing, and cost estimating are proposed as well as other possible future applications presented as perspectives and future works that can be supported by the defined environment dedicated to early phase assembly systems design and automation decision.

This insures successful reproduction and continued growth over their lifespan. Adapting to the annual environmental cycle as well as more long-term environmental fluctuations, such as, global warming is critical to insuring survival of the species. Thus, the tree must utilize physiological systems to sense and respond in time and space to the appropriate environmental cues. Historically, many of the physiological players such as phytohormones and their actions have been well characterized, however, the underlying regulation of the genes and gene networks controlling these physiological systems remains relatively unknown. With advances in molecular genetics and genomics technologies, we are beginning to understand the genetic basis for a number of important phenological traits. It is the intent of this review to highlight our current state of knowledge for the genetics of the timing of bud-break in trees focusing on both fruit and forest trees to provide a framework to guide future efforts to understand how the tree coordinates annual growth, development and reproduction with the environmental cycle.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0065-2296		978-0-12-401723-8; 978-0-12-398548-4	WOS:000385021100007

As the heterogeneity of future high performance computing systems keeps increasing, it becomes paramount to judiciously use CPUs and accelerators to improve performance and/or reduce energy consumption. The widely used programming model today is to offload computation intensive workload to accelerators. Theoretically, the hybrid computing model (i.e. running a subset of calculations concurrently on both CPUs and accelerators) can potentially offer advantages of improved energy efficiency and performance. However, this is not yet a common practice due to the uncertainty of energy/performance benefits as well as the increased programming complexity. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on achieving the balance between energy and performance of hybrid computing applications. We show that performance and energy optimization can be conflicting goals, the sweet spot between performance and energy consumption varies with application characteristics and is highly dependent on specific implementations, that the choice of compiler can not only influence runtime but also energy use, and that the choice of cross platform strategies (e.g. OpenCL) can result in degraded performance and increased energy.

IEEE					Improving Efficiency of Wireless Sensor Networks Through Lightweight In-Memory Compression								2015 SIXTH INTERNATIONAL GREEN COMPUTING CONFERENCE AND SUSTAINABLE COMPUTING CONFERENCE (IGSC)														2015	2015	Data compression is an enabling technique to many applications, such as data center storage, multimedia streaming, and lightweight computing platforms, amongst others. These special-purpose compression approaches typically achieve incomparable compression ratios as core features of the application and dataset are leveraged to reduce duplication of identical or similar features in the original data. Sensor data in systems such as wireless sensor networks, often includes a variety of data types. However, within a particular data or sensor type, typically the data has a low dynamic range which can be leveraged to increase its compressibility. In this paper we present a memory and network system co-design approach that stores data using in-place lightweight compressed pages in memory, and utilizes this compressed data to send shortened blocks over a wireless point to point network. Additionally, we propose a technique named source-aware layout reorganization (SALR) to improve the compressibility of the sensor data, using either software-or hardware-based approaches. We demonstrate that our proposed lightweight compression approach in hardware with SALR, while achieving a slightly lower compression ratio to traditional software compression, can outperform software compression in wireless communication by 7.3% for relatively slow Bluetooth links and 65.4% with faster WiFi-Direct links.

In the context of scientific computing, validation aims to determine the worthiness of a model in regard to its support of critical decision making. This determination of worthiness must occur in the face of unavoidable idealizations in the mathematical representation of the phenomena the model is intended to represent. These models are often parameterized further complicating the validation problem due to the need to determine appropriate parameter values for the imperfect mathematical representations. The determination of worthiness then becomes assessing whether an unavoidably imperfect mathematical model, subjected to poorly known input parameters, can predict sufficiently well to serve its intended purpose. To achieve this, we herein evaluate the agreement between a model's predictions and associated experiments as well as the robustness of this agreement given imperfections in both the model's mathematical representation of reality as well as its input parameter values.

While these errors and uncertainties are quantifiable, compensations between them can lead to multiple model forms and input parameter sets exhibiting a similar level of agreement with available experimental observations. Such non-uniqueness makes the selection of a single, best computer model (i.e. model form and values for its associate parameters) unjustifiable. Therefore, it becomes necessary to evaluate model performance based not only on the fidelity of the predictions to available experiments but also on a model's ability to sustain such fidelity given the incompleteness of knowledge regarding the model itself, such an ability will herein be referred to as robustness. In this paper, the authors present a multi-objective approach to model calibration that accounts for not only the model's fidelity to experiments but also its robustness to incomplete knowledge. With two conflicting objectives, the multi-objective model calibration results in a family of non-dominated solutions exhibiting varying levels of fidelity and robustness effectively forming a Pareto front. The Pareto front solutions can be grouped depending on their nature of compromise between the two objectives, which can in turn help determine clusters in the parameter domain. The knowledge of these clusters can shed light on the nature of compensations as well as aid in the inference of uncertain input parameters. To demonstrate the feasibility and application of this new approach, we consider the computer model of a structural steel frame with uncertain connection stiffness parameters under static loading conditions.

The timing jitter of the measured pulses is mainly from the trigger pulse generator in the circuit consisting of conventional CMOS inverters and NAND gates. Furthermore, the response surface model combined with Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) is proposed to model the timing jitter of short pulse generation circuits. The analytical model is verified with Cadence using 0.13 mu m CMOS technology. In order to reduce the timing jitter, MOS current-mode logic (MCML) circuits are used in the trigger pulse generator. Up to 50% improvement on the timing jitter can be obtained, due to the differential structure of MCML circuits.

Although existing countermeasures have success in malware detection, corresponding counter-countermeasures are always emerging. In this study, a counter-countermeasure that avoids network-based detection approaches by camouflaging malicious traffic as an innocuous protocol is presented. The approach includes two steps: Traffic format transformation and side-channel massage (SCM). Format-transforming encryption (FTE) translates protocol syntax to mimic another innocuous protocol while SCM obscures traffic side-channels. The proposed approach is illustrated by transforming Zeus botnet (Zbot) Command and Control (C&C) traffic into smart grid Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) data. The experimental results show that the transformed traffic is identified by Wireshark as synchrophasor protocol, and the transformed protocol fools current side-channel attacks. Moreover, it is shown that a real smart grid Phasor Data Concentrator (PDC) accepts the false PMU data.					10th International Conference on Malicious and Unwanted Software (MALWARE)10th International Conference on Malicious and Unwanted Software (MALWARE)	OCT 20-22, 2015OCT 20-22, 2015		Fajardo, PRFajardo, PR	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-5090-0319-8	WOS:000380620100013

IEEE					Optimal Allocation of Power Routers in a STATCOM-Installed Electric Grid with High Penetration of Wind Energy								2015 CLEMSON UNIVERSITY POWER SYSTEMS CONFERENCE (PSC)		Clemson University Power Systems Conference												2015	2015	Wind generation continues to increase as a source of renewable energy. However, adding intermittent renewable energy may lead to overloaded lines as well as low voltage buses. Static synchronous compensators (STATCOMs) can provide significant reactive power to ensure the voltage stability, but overloaded lines may still exist. Therefore, power routers, which route power away from overloaded lines to underutilized lines, are required. In order to provide the best power-flow control with the lowest cost, the power routers should be optimally designed, for both their ratings and locations. The coordination between the power routers and the STATCOMs should also be taken into consideration. This paper introduces a general approach to determine the optimal location and sizing of the power routers for a power system with overloaded lines, based on a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Simulation studies on a 12-bus test system verify the proposed method.

IEEE					Enhancing SCIG-based Wind Turbine Generator Performance through Reactive Power Control								2015 CLEMSON UNIVERSITY POWER SYSTEMS CONFERENCE (PSC)		Clemson University Power Systems Conference												2015	2015	Increase in the market share of wind energy in total electricity generation and its impact to power grid has imposed new challenges to the stability of each wind turbine generator (WTG) unit. In the case of power undersupply, the problem on voltage stability and voltage collapse will eventually occur. In this paper, the impact of reactive power control in improving the performance of squirrel cage induction generator-based (SCIG-based) WTGs is presented. In the asynchronous operation of induction machine, the increment of wind power generation is feasible by absorption of more reactive power. Increasing the reactive power consumption of induction generator results in reduction of voltage in the bus connected to the wind farm from the grid. In this scenario, inadequate reactive power control can lead to instability in the power network. The studies conducted in this paper are based on the quasi-static time-domain simulations (QSTDS) and continuation power flow (CPF) algorithm framework. The results obtained indicate that with increment of wind power penetration in a power system, adequate reactive power support is required to maintain stability, else the stable performance of the wind farm will be threatened and will lead to over-speeding of SCIGs. The use of SVC and STATCOM as a practical solution in improvement of wind farms-based power system stability is investigated and presented.

Our approach provides an alternative to stochastic, robust optimization commonly used in recent years in that we consider a range of uncertainty rather than just the most likely case or worst case scenario. In particular, we model operation of the electricity market of the ISO New England, an independent Regional Transmission Organization serving the New England area, using hourly zonal data for the last five years. Alternative investments in production or infrastructure must be evaluated in an environment of risk and Knightian uncertainty. Assuming that performance is modeled as a random function of deterministic but uncertain demand allows risk to be measured by value at risk curves over a range of uncertain demand. The preferred investment is determined by a preference rule defined on the set of value at risk curves, a standard multi-criteria approach.

Ashfaqur; Venayagamoorthy, Ganesh Kumar			IEEE					Scalable Cellular Computational Network based WLS State Estimator for Power Systems								2015 CLEMSON UNIVERSITY POWER SYSTEMS CONFERENCE (PSC)		Clemson University Power Systems Conference												2015	2015	Modern interconnected electric power systems are made up of a large number of buses to meet the demand of electricity across large geographical distances. The large number of buses and interconnections across multiple areas result in a complex network and cause an increase in computational requirements on the processor. In order to meet the requirements of this increased complexity for state estimation, distributed estimation is getting attention nowadays. A new approach based on Cellular Computational Network (CCN) for static state estimation is proposed to overcome the computational demand of large power networks in general. The CCN architecture requires a cell at every bus where the states need to be estimated. A cell uses locally available information to estimate voltage magnitude and angle of its bus. The cells exploit output information of other cells in some electrical proximity prior to computing the outputs for next time step. Beside the promise of scalability of the CCN architecture, a fully observable system for state estimation and other applications can be realized. As the traditional estimators take all the measurements at a time and executes the estimation, missing some of the measurements may cause it to loose observability. In this paper, CCN based architecture is implemented with the popular Weighted Least Square (WLS) estimator on nonlinear power flow equations to estimate off-line data. Through simulation, the scalability and observability of the CCN based framework is investigated.

There are several configurations of flying-capacitor-based converters presented and reviewed in the literature. One of the promising topologies of the FCM converter suitable for single/three-phase applications requiring isolated converters is H-Bridge (Full-Bridge) FCM converter wherein two FCM converters are connected back-to-back encircling one dc voltage source. Due to a superior line-to-line harmonic performance of the level-shifted-carrier pulse-width-modulation (LSC-PWM), this paper proposes an active voltage control of five-level H-bridge FCM converter operated under LSC-PWMs. The general scheme of the proposed active voltage balancing is implemented by utilization of logic-gates without requiring any lookup table. The five-level H-bridge FCM is simulated in PSCAD and the simulation results are provided. Moreover, the performance of the proposed active voltage balancing is investigated under different LSC-PWM strategies to show which one results in a better harmonic performance and which one results in less voltage ripple across the flying capacitors.

In this paper, an adaptive local gamma correction method based on mean value adjustment is proposed, which is aimed at improve local details in both dark and bright regions in image. As the preprocessing, a global enhancement method is applied to improve the global contrast and then the proposed local gamma correction is undertook. Based on the Shih-Chia Huang's method, the proposed local gamma correction method has made improvement in two aspects and applied it to the local regions. For one thing, the average gray is regarded as one of the critical factors to determine the gamma value in the corresponding local region, which could adaptively improve the contrast both in dark and bright areas while preserve the original luminance of the regions that already own good contrast. For the other, followed by color correction, a novel histogram modification method aimed at avoiding the over-enhancement in smooth regions is used, which manager to maintain the histogram's original shape and suppress the large components in it at the same time. Experiments prove that the proposed method could get much more visual-pleasing and natural results.

In this paper, we devise a distributed method for this problem, namely Distributed VOronoi based Cooperation scheme (DVOC), where nodes cooperate in hole detection and recovery. In previous Voronoi based schemes, each node only monitors its own critical points. Such methods are inefficient for k-coverage because the critical points are far away from their generating nodes in k-order Voronoi diagram, causing high cost for transmission and computing. As a solution, DVOC enables nodes to monitor others' critical points around themselves by building local Voronoi diagrams (LVDs). Further, DVOC constrains the movement of every node to avoid generating new holes. If a node cannot reach its destination due to the constraint, its hole healing responsibility will fall to other cooperating nodes. The experimental results from the real world testbed demonstrate that DVOC outperforms the previous schemes.

In such scenarios, moving data from one place (landmark) to another place (landmark) is essential for data communication between different areas. However, current DTN routing algorithms either fail to fully utilize node mobility or have additional requirements that cannot be satisfied easily (i.e., require base stations or the global traffic distribution). Therefore, in this paper, we propose a distributed greedy routing algorithm, namely GreedyFlow, for efficient packet routing between landmarks. GreedyFlow builds a local traffic map and a global landmark map on each node. The local traffic map indicates the node's knowledge about the amount of traffic (node transition) between landmarks in the area where it primarily visits. It is constructed by collecting encountered nodes' transit frequencies between these landmarks. The global landmark map shows the distribution of landmarks in the system and is built offline. In packet routing, the global landmark map shows the general packet forwarding direction, while the local traffic map helps determine the next-hop landmark on the fastest path in the forwarding direction. As a result, packets are greedily forwarded toward their destination landmarks. Extensive real trace driven experiments demonstrate the high efficiency of GreedyFlow.

The visualization tools used are Matlab and R. Additional analysis was done with a high performance computing cluster ( Clemson University's Palmetto cluster). The data is of an American Sycamore Platanus occidentalis over a period of eight weeks as the tree transitions from fall into winter. The conclusions of this study have implications in outlining innovative approaches to three-dimensional tree dynamic measurement using advanced technology and tools. These approaches can provide the baseline information of a forest structure for greater understanding of how a tree changes seasonally, as well as the establishment of methodology for making laser scanning software and Matlab's Image Processing Toolbox more flexible to use.

It is important to examine these topics not only in South Carolina, but also nationally and globally, as water circulates and is a vital source for survival that is becoming increasingly valuable. This study utilizes telephone survey data that sought to identify South Carolina residents' knowledge, attitudes and behaviors regarding nonpoint source water pollution, and watershed management. This data was collected in 2013 in five regions of South Carolina: Pee Dee, Charleston, Midlands, Grand Strand, and the Upstate. The purpose of this visualization project was to describe the process of using visualization tools for expressing residents' opinions about a several issues related to stormwater management. These particular visualization tools will ease the comprehension of environmental perceptions by transferring survey data from Excel spreadsheets to illustrations that are easy to read and are more visually appealing. The visualization instruments used were a social media marketing tool, Radian6, and ESRI's geographical information system for data topography: ArcGIS. Additionally, a flip-book was developed as an educational supplement to raise awareness of the environmental impact and personal responsibility of water pollution. The successful implementation of the methodology will allow a keener observation and presentation of residents' environmental awareness. The knowledge gained can be used to strengthen stormwater education efforts, both regionally and nationally.

However, as the graphics rendering is offloaded to the cloud, the data transmission between the end-users and the cloud significantly increases the response latency and limits the user coverage, thus preventing cloud gaming to achieve high user Quality of Experience (QoE). To solve this problem, previous research suggested deploying more datacenters, but it comes at a prohibitive cost. We propose a lightweight system called CloudFog, which incorporates "fog" consisting of supernodes that are responsible for rendering game videos and streaming them to their nearby players. Fog enables the cloud to be only responsible for the intensive game state computation and sending update information to supernodes, which significantly reduce the traffic hence the latency and bandwidth consumption. Experimental results from PeerSim and PlanetLab show the effectiveness and efficiency of CloudFog in increasing user coverage, reducing response latency and bandwidth consumption.					2015 IEEE 35th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems2015 IEEE 35th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems	JUN 29-JUL 02, 2015JUN 29-JUL 02, 2015		Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OHOhio State Univ, Columbus, OH	1	0	0	0	0	1			1063-6927		978-1-4673-7214-5	WOS:000380516200075

In order to minimize the payment costs, existing works aim to keep the traffic on each link under the charging volume (i.e., 95th percentile traffic volume from the beginning of a charging period up to current time). However, these methods cannot fully utilize each link's available bandwidth capacity, and may increase the charging volumes. To further reduce the bandwidth payment cost by fully utilizing link bandwidth, we propose an economical and deadline-driven video flow scheduling system, called EcoFlow. Considering different video flows have different transmission deadlines, EcoFlow transmits videos in the order of their deadline tightness and postpones the deliveries of later-deadline videos to later time slots so that the charging volume at current time interval will not increase. The flows that are expected to miss their deadlines are divided into subflows to be rerouted to other under-utilized links in order to meet their deadlines without increasing charging volumes. Experimental results on PlanetLab and EC2 show that compared to existing methods, EcoFlow achieves the least bandwidth costs for cloud providers.					2015 IEEE 35th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems2015 IEEE 35th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems	JUN 29-JUL 02, 2015JUN 29-JUL 02, 2015		Ohio State Univ, Columbus, OHOhio State Univ, Columbus, OH	0	0	0	0	0	0			1063-6927		978-1-4673-7214-5	WOS:000380516200076

ES3 incorporates (1) a data allocation and reservation algorithm, which allocates each data item to a datacenter and determines the reservation amount on datacenters by leveraging all the pricing policies; (2) a genetic algorithm based data allocation adjustment approach, which makes data Get/Put rates stable in each datacenter to maximize the reservation benefit.

Researchers mostly focus on energy conservation through increasing the efficiency of such facilities, optimizing energy supplies, and scheduling efficient production sequences. However, attention is seldom focused on holistic energy modeling at the level of process assembly lines. In this study, the problem of energy consumption during the automotive vehicle final assembly (FA) process is discussed. An energy classification in the final assembly department is generated to give more transparent understanding of the energy consumption in each category. Typical energy models of every energy category are presented to demonstrate the potential energy savings through a combined approach. Finally, considering the current status of most manufacturing plant metering systems, a three-level metering system is proposed to support the hybrid (i.e., discrete and continuous, deterministic and stochastic) modeling approach.

The Smart Community is located at the Chiang Mai World Green City of the Asian Development Institute for Community Economy and Technology (adiCET) in Mae Rim Campus of Chiang Mai Rajabhat University, Thailand. The community is comprised of 6 small houses, an office, a minimart, a coffee shop, a restaurant and an organic farm. All of the devices and appliances in the houses and farm are able to operate on DC microgrid, which include lighting, air conditioner, television, refrigerator, computer, water heater, and water pump. These appliances were modified to be able to use with DC as well as AC systems to increase the flexibility of power usage for the transition toward the DC based community. For the other buildings, both AC and DC grids are integrated in the office, minimart, coffee shop, and restaurant. For example during normal operation of the office, the air condition and lightings used the DC grids, but the copier machine and printers used the AC grid. The adiCET faculties, students, researchers and administrative staff used the Smart Community as the working and living place. Operation of the DC and AC usage as well as the issues occurred from the 4-years development were monitored and recorded.

IEEE					Circuit Breaker for DC Micro Grids								2015 IEEE FIRST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DC MICROGRIDS (ICDCM)								221	+					2015	2015	In order to eliminate power conversion steps, future micro grids with renewable energy sources are being visualized as dc power systems. System components such as sources (solar panels, fuels cells, etc.) loads, and power conversion have been identified and are readily available. However, when it comes to dc circuit breakers, many designs are still in the experimental phase. The main limitation is that interrupting a current which does not have a zero crossing will sustain an arc. This paper introduces a new type of dc circuit breaker. It uses a short conduction path between the breaker as well as mutual coupling to automatically and rapidly switch off in response to a fault. The proposed breaker also can have a crowbar switch on the output so that it can be used as a dc switch. Mathematical analysis, detailed simulation, and laboratory measurements of the new dc switch are included.

Solar energy as a main source of on-board fuel has not been extensively investigated. This paper reports on the usage of solar energy for transportation and investigates the extended driving range, the economic value, and the energy return of investment (EROI) of adding on-board photovoltaic (PV) technologies to plug-in electric vehicles (EV). The study develops a comprehensive PV system model and optimizes the solar energy to DC electrical power output ratio for on-driving mode. In times of no-use, the proposed system transforms into a flexible energy generation system that can be fed into the grid and used to power DC electrical devices in homes and offices. The results show that by adding on-board PVs to cover less than 50% of the projected horizontal surface area of a typical passenger EV, up to 50% of the total daily miles traveled by a person in the U.S. could be driven by solar energy. For the lifetime driving cost, even with low electricity price (0.13 $/kWh), adding on-board PV shows a positive impact if the system is operating in high solar energy environment (e.g. Arizona). If the electricity price is high ((0.35 $/kWh), there is positive economic impact even in low solar energy environments (e.g. Massachusetts). The energy payback time (EPBT) is found in a range 3.5-4.8 years, depending on where the system operates and energy return of investment (EROI) is between 6.2 to 8.6 times.

Automatic generation control is implemented to control power outputs of generators and stabilize the system frequency. It is desirable with increasing levels of PV penetration to have the foresight of frequency fluctuations to enable advanced controls. A new methodology is presented in this paper for predicting frequency of synchronous generators in a power system with solar PV. A cellular computational network (CCN) is used to perform multi-timescale frequency prediction. CCNs are scalable and distributed computing paradigms. Thus, CCNs are suitable for fast prediction of frequency of synchronous generators distributed spatially across a power system. The inputs to cells of CCN are derived from phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurements of frequency and voltage phasor at the respective generator buses. Past and current measurements enable multi-timescale frequency predictions of synchronous generators. Typical multi-timescale frequency predictions using the CCN are illustrated on a two-area four-machine power system with solar PV integrated.

In fact, as solution to grid integration of photovoltaic arrays, voltage source inverters (VSI) are widely utilized as the PEI entity. The VSI is controlled by a set of proportional-integral (PI) controllers, which require optimal tuning in order to guarantee smooth operation of PV-system especially when exposed to severe meteorological conditions e.g. sudden cloud covers. Hence, developing a practical robust tuning method for optimizing the PV-inverter set of controllers i.e. the DC-link voltage controller, the reactive power controller, and the decoupled current controller becomes of paramount importance. This paper employs a particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach to optimally tune these controllers based on online operation performance of the PV-system. The PSO approach is integrated into a real-time digital simulator (RTDS) for searching the inverter PI controllers parameters. The simulation results conclude the superiority of this approach in comparison to conventional inverter PI controller tuning methods; enhancing the PV-system transient and steady-state step-response over a wide operating range of irradiance.

In imaging applications, Bessel beams have been successfully used to provide extended focuses for volumetric imaging and uniformed illumination plane in light-sheet microscopy. Coupled with two-photon excitation, Bessel beams have been successfully used in realizing fluorescence projected volumetric imaging. We demonstrated previously a stereoscopic solution-two-photon fluorescence stereo microscopy (TPFSM)-for recovering the depth information in volumetric imaging with Bessel beams. In TPFSM, tilted Bessel beams were used to generate stereoscopic images on a laser scanning two-photon fluorescence microscope; upon post image processing we could successfully provide 3D perception of acquired volume images by wearing anaglyph 3D glasses. However, tilted Bessel beams were generated by shifting either an axicon or an objective laterally; the slow imaging speed and severe aberrations made it hard to use in real-time volume imaging. In this article, we report recent improvements of TPFSM with newly designed scanner and imaging software, which allows 3D stereoscopic imaging without moving any of the optical components on the setup. This improvement has dramatically improved focusing qualities and imaging speed so that the TPFSM can be performed potentially in real-time to provide 3D visualization in scattering media without post image processing.

The key innovation is the incorporation of robot trust (in the human) in the underlying robot motion planning algorithm. Using a weighted Jacobian pseudoinverse algorithm, the robot motions are varied (trading off collision risk against task efficiency) based on the current value of trust. The targeted application is small-scale manufacturing, but the approach can be applied to many forms of robot-human handovers and interactions.

Due to their superior properties that make them appealing for these industries such as their high strength at elevated operating temperatures, manufacturing these alloys to end product specifications has been a difficult task. Despite the several recent studies that unearth various methods to tackle different aspects of this challenge, machining of nickel-based superalloys continues to be a mostly unknown territory. Researchers have mostly worked on finding optimal machining parameters that provide milder operating conditions, lower cost of tooling, or better end-product dimensional accuracy and surface quality; however, the tool material and type are generally constant in these studies. Therefore, it is difficult to apply the information gathered from these studies when there is a change in the machine tool that has been used, as it frequently happens when tool manufacturers produce new tools that perform better.In this study, an alternative glance at the bigger picture is presented, providing an insight toward a generalized model that directly addresses the industrial concern of process cost. Solid carbide and ceramic tools, which are known to be heavily utilized in manufacturing gas turbine components, are investigated by their performance as well as the relative cost they induce during end milling the gamma-prime strengthened nickel-based superalloy. First, the performance of solid carbide tools with no coating are compared to those with coatings of different material and cost, through a set of tool life experiments at industrially applicable machining conditions. Then, the performances of solid ceramic tools are investigated using machining conditions taken directly from gas turbine component production. Finally, a cost-based model is introduced to compare the performance of the solid carbide and ceramic tools.					43rd North American Manufacturing Research Conference, NAMRC 4343rd North American Manufacturing Research Conference, NAMRC 43	JUN 08-12, 2015JUN 08-12, 2015		Charlotte, NCCharlotte, NC	0	0	0	0	0	0			2351-9789		*****************	WOS:000380512300045		
S	Pleta, Abram; Ulutan, Durul; Mears, Laine						Shih, AJ; Wang, LH		An Investigation of Alternative Path Planning Strategies for Machining of Nickel-Based Superalloys								43RD NORTH AMERICAN MANUFACTURING RESEARCH CONFERENCE, NAMRC 43		Procedia Manufacturing		1				556	566		10.1016/j.promfg.2015.09.032			2015	2015	Nickel-based superalloys play a crucial role in elevated temperature applications where high strength and high resistance to corrosion and creep resistance are required. These environments are largely found in the aerospace, nuclear power and gas turbine industries. Due to the properties that make them suitable for their end use they remain a challenge to manufacture. In the machining of nickel-based superalloys high cutting forces and tool wear occur greatly reducing their machinability. Although there have been multiple recent studies on the machining of such alloys, the field remains vastly unexplored. A limited amount of research has been done in tool path methods, as most previous research focuses on finding optimal machining parameters to curtail the difficulties in machining while keeping the tool path constant. An alternative tool path, trochoidal milling, has been identified to combat the difficulties in machining superalloys and combines linear motion with uniform circular motion, reducing chip load in exchange for increased machining time. Although this method has been shown to reduce flank wear on tools it suffers from notch wear at the depth of cut line.In this study the authors propose and evaluate a new tool path termed variable depth milling (VDM) to reduce or eliminate the occurrence of notch wear in nickel-based superalloys. In this method the axial depth of cut is varied across the tool in a linear fashion, progressing from a maximum depth of cut value to zero in an upward ramping fashion. This work characterizes the effects of trochoidal milling and variable depth milling techniques and compares them against a traditional milling technique, end milling. In order to compare these alternative tool path approaches directly to end milling the authors utilize relatively new metrics to provide a more representative comparison of productivity and efficiency characteristics: volumetric material removal per unit tool wear (MR/VB) and the material removal rate per unit tool wear (MRR/VB). It was found that trochoidal milling was superior to end milling in terms of productivity, where trochoidal could machine at least seven times more material than end milling with the same amount of tool wear with similar efficiency as end milling. It was demonstrated that VDM eliminated the formation of notch wear in the cutting tool at the expense of a slight decrease in productivity and efficiency.					43rd North American Manufacturing Research Conference, NAMRC 4343rd North American Manufacturing Research Conference, NAMRC 43	JUN 08-12, 2015JUN 08-12, 2015		Charlotte, NCCharlotte, NC	1	0	0	0	0	1			2351-9789		*****************	WOS:000380512300048

A worn out tool can deteriorate the surface finish or dimensional accuracy of the part. Due to the uncertainties that originate from machining, workpiece material composition, and measurement, predicting tool wear is a challenging task in modern manufacturing processes. Low cost sensing technology for measuring spindle current is commonly deployed in the CNC machine to measure spindle power consumption for predicting tool wear. In this study, spindle power information was integrated into a Kalman filter methodology to predict tool flank wear in cutting hard-to-machine gamma-prime strengthened alloys. Results show a maximum of 18% error in estimation, which indicates a good potential of using Kalman filter in predicting tool flank wear.					43rd North American Manufacturing Research Conference, NAMRC 4343rd North American Manufacturing Research Conference, NAMRC 43	JUN 08-12, 2015JUN 08-12, 2015		Charlotte, NCCharlotte, NC	0	0	0	0	0	0			2351-9789		*****************	WOS:000380512300062

This enormous set-up is currently operated by more than 170,000 public water systems. Sustainability of the water supply system faces several imminent challenges such as: 1) increasing water main breaks, 2) decreasing fresh water resources, 3) untraceable non-revenue water use, and 4) increasing water demands. However, current water supply management practices are not capable of providing fundamental solutions to the issues identified above. Big Data is a new technical concept to collect massive amounts of relevant data from sensors installed to monitor structural condition, usage, and system performance. This Big Data concept can be realized by deploying Internet of Things (IoT) technology throughout the water supply infrastructure and consumers' usage. This paper presents a schematic development of IoT application for Big Data collection through a myriad of water clients. The scheme consists of downstream and upstream data collection using Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies connecting to IoT. Downstream data shall provide water usage and performance data to clients and upstream data is similar to traditional SCADA and Automated Meter Reading (AMR) systems. Ultimately, all data will be converged to build a Big Data collection system where data mining identifies 1) local and system performances including pressure and flow, 2) non-revenue and illegitimate water consumption, and 3) locations and quantity of water breaks and water losses. The goal of this development is to enable both utilities and consumers to proactively manage their water usage and achieve higher levels of sustainability in water supply. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Deteriorating supply infrastructure makes the task of meeting water demands even more challenging. The combination of source and supply challenges encouraged the consideration of sustainable and reliable alternatives for future water supply management. On-site greywater reuse is one such alternative that is becoming increasingly popular for its sustainable benefits such as ready availability, energy savings, reduced freshwater withdrawals and less effluent runoff. While the treatment technologies for making it economically viable are currently being investigated by other researchers, this paper investigates the improvement in supply reliability when traditional water supply systems are complemented by on-site greywater reuse. A robust computational model is developed for quantifying reliabilities of traditional and on-site greywater reuse systems for a given study area. The results revealed that there is up to 17% of improvement in supply reliability due to the on-site greywater reuse systems. A one-way sensitivity analysis conducted on the results indicated that the observed reliability improvement is sensitive to system age, pipeline roughness, treatment efficiency and allowable use of reclaimed water. Further research is needed to investigate the value of this reliability improvement by considering the life cycle cost and energy implications of on-site greywater reuse alternative.

Water supply systems in the United States comprise about one million mile length of interconnected pipelines that transport water from sources to consumption points with the support of treatment plants, pumping stations, storage tanks and valves. While depleting freshwater sources in some regions is an alarming concern, supply infrastructure woes exacerbate the problem of meeting supply reliability targets. Evidenced by the "D" or lower grade it has been receiving over the past few ASCE infrastructure report cards, the quality of water supply infrastructure has degraded to an extent where 240,000 water mains fail annually in the U.S. A majority of these failures result in significant economic, environmental and societal consequences. Pro-active rehabilitation of deteriorated infrastructure will avoid these unwarranted failure consequences. This paper employs empirical analysis of the economic, environmental and societal consequences of large-diameter water main failures to estimate their overall impact cost. Data on the impacts of 11 large-diameter water main failures has been gathered and synthesized. The results of this paper will aid in predicting the future water main failure consequences to enable risk-based, long-term capital improvement planning of water supply systems. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Current algorithms for solving this problem have three problems: i) they cannot handle the dilemma between the efficiency of handing big data and the precision of the discovered densest subgraph; ii) they cannot take advantage of both the parallel computing on MapReduce and in-memory computing on one computer; iii) their applicability to different kinds of graphs has not been discussed. Our proposed algorithm combines the MapReduce parallel computing with in-memory computing on one computer together to improve the efficiency and precision of discovering the densest subgraphs. The algorithm consists of two computational phases: i) the graph reduction in the MapReduce framework; ii) the densest subgraph discovery in memory. Further, we theoretically analyze the correctness of this algorithm and its applicability in different natural graphs. We conduct extensive experimental evaluations in a MapReduce framework on both massive real-world graphs and simulated graphs to test our algorithm in comparison with other algorithms. Experimental results show that our algorithm is more time-efficient and precise than other algorithms.

However, due to engineering limitations, variability in manufacturing, and person-to-person differences in eye position, virtual environments are often geometrically inaccurate. Correcting these inaccuracies typically requires complicated or interactive calibration procedures. In this document we present a method for calibrating head-mounted displays and other display surfaces using an automated, low-cost camera system. A unique aspect of this method is that the calibration of geometric distortions, field of view, and chromatic aberration are achieved without the need for a priori knowledge of the display system's intrinsic parameters. Since this calibration method can easily measure display distortions, we further extend our work to serve to measure the effect of eye position on the apparent location of imagery presented in a virtual reality head mounted display. We test a range of reasonable eye positions that may result from person-to-person variations in display placement and interpupilary distances. It was observed that the pattern of geometric distortions introduced by the display's optical system changes substantially as the eye moves from one position to the next. Though many commercial and research VR systems calibrate for interpupillary distance and optical distortions separately, this may be insufficient as eye position influences distortion characteristics.

When designing batteryless sensors that are powered by harvested energy, this traditional approach results in devices that charge slowly and that are more error prone, inflexible, and inefficient than they could be.This paper presents a novel federated approach to energy storage, called UFoP, that partitions and prioritizes harvested energy automatically into multiple isolated smaller energy stores (capacitors). UFoP simplifies task scheduling, enables efficient use of components with differing voltage requirements, and produces devices that charge more quickly under identical harvesting conditions than a traditional centralized approach. We have implemented a UFoP reference design and conducted extensive experimental evaluation, including a short deployment. Our experimental results using an MSP430-based prototype show that UFoP provides as much as 10% more computational availability, and as much as four times more radio availability than the centralized approach. For all applications and energy environments evaluated, UFoP harvested 0.7-10.2% more energy than the centralized equivalent; meaning UFoP adds zero energy overhead.					13th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems (SenSys)13th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems (SenSys)	NOV 04-04, 2015NOV 04-04, 2015	ACM SIGARCH; ACM SIGBED; ACM SIGCOMM; ACM SIGMETRICS; ACM SIGMOBILE; ACM SIGOPS; Golfzon; NSF; KAIST Sch Comp; KAIST Ctr Mobile Software Platform; KT; Naver Labs; Samsung Electronics; SK Telecom; Seoul Metropolitan Govt; Korea Tourism Org; Kyungpook Nat Univ CSOS; DGISTACM SIGARCH; ACM SIGBED; ACM SIGCOMM; ACM SIGMETRICS; ACM SIGMOBILE; ACM SIGOPS; Golfzon; NSF; KAIST Sch Comp; KAIST Ctr Mobile Software Platform; KT; Naver Labs; Samsung Electronics; SK Telecom; Seoul Metropolitan Govt; Korea Tourism Org; Kyungpook Nat Univ CSOS; DGIST	Seoul, SOUTH KOREASeoul, SOUTH KOREA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4503-3631-4	WOS:000380612400003

These types of situations can leave a device in a state that compromises its programmability, often rendering the device useless. Existing attempts to address the problem of robust wireless reprogramming have all been software-based solutions, that are vulnerable to certain errors, such as memory corruption, can corrupt the recovery programs. We propose a hardware-based solution to wireless reprogramming, physically separating the programmer and target device. This separation limits the propagation of errors, and ensures the device will always be recoverable. In this poster we will present the design and an early prototype of our approach -an ultra-low-power, low-cost hardware solution to ensure recovery from fatal errors and reprogrammability in wireless systems. This poster discusses the current system design, initial results, and system analysis from our current prototype. We also present future and ongoing directions, as well as key research questions.

While harvesting free energy from the environment has enabled many applications, it has also spawned new problems, and new paradigms. Notably, making decisions on when to use high power sensors and external components when energy is scarce, and future supply is unpredictable. Because sensor nodes generally share a single, centralized energy store, seemingly atomic, or unrelated sensing tasks can hamper each other by drawing the supply voltage too low, and draining the energy reservoir.This demonstration presents the United Federation of Peripherals (UFoP), a novel method of separating energy concerns in hardware by allocating dedicated energy storage (in the form of small capacitors) to specific sensor components, and charging them in a prioritized fashion with an analog front end. UFoP gives application designers a more deterministic view of energy and task scheduling, allowing them to make better informed decisions when developing sensor applications. Designers do not have to rely on crude estimates or simulations but can instead depend on in-situ analog measurements to opportunistically drive their applications.					13th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems (SenSys)13th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems (SenSys)	NOV 04-04, 2015NOV 04-04, 2015	ACM SIGARCH; ACM SIGBED; ACM SIGCOMM; ACM SIGMETRICS; ACM SIGMOBILE; ACM SIGOPS; Golfzon; NSF; KAIST Sch Comp; KAIST Ctr Mobile Software Platform; KT; Naver Labs; Samsung Electronics; SK Telecom; Seoul Metropolitan Govt; Korea Tourism Org; Kyungpook Nat Univ CSOS; DGISTACM SIGARCH; ACM SIGBED; ACM SIGCOMM; ACM SIGMETRICS; ACM SIGMOBILE; ACM SIGOPS; Golfzon; NSF; KAIST Sch Comp; KAIST Ctr Mobile Software Platform; KT; Naver Labs; Samsung Electronics; SK Telecom; Seoul Metropolitan Govt; Korea Tourism Org; Kyungpook Nat Univ CSOS; DGIST	Seoul, SOUTH KOREASeoul, SOUTH KOREA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4503-3631-4	WOS:000380612400064

Recently, a new class of batteryless devices has arisen that promise operation in perpetuity, but often at the cost of reliability, and complexity. Programming, profiling, debugging, and building these applications is a significant challenge; designers must often be capable of implementing custom hardware to manage energy, while writing code in an environment that does not guarantee task completion. In this abstract, we motivate batteryless sensing, examine the state of the art, and propose a novel approach to programming, profiling, debugging, and building, tiny, batteryless sensors.					13th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems (SenSys)13th ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems (SenSys)	NOV 04-04, 2015NOV 04-04, 2015	ACM SIGARCH; ACM SIGBED; ACM SIGCOMM; ACM SIGMETRICS; ACM SIGMOBILE; ACM SIGOPS; Golfzon; NSF; KAIST Sch Comp; KAIST Ctr Mobile Software Platform; KT; Naver Labs; Samsung Electronics; SK Telecom; Seoul Metropolitan Govt; Korea Tourism Org; Kyungpook Nat Univ CSOS; DGISTACM SIGARCH; ACM SIGBED; ACM SIGCOMM; ACM SIGMETRICS; ACM SIGMOBILE; ACM SIGOPS; Golfzon; NSF; KAIST Sch Comp; KAIST Ctr Mobile Software Platform; KT; Naver Labs; Samsung Electronics; SK Telecom; Seoul Metropolitan Govt; Korea Tourism Org; Kyungpook Nat Univ CSOS; DGIST	Seoul, SOUTH KOREASeoul, SOUTH KOREA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4503-3631-4	WOS:000380612400089

Our technique, termed Dual-Stage Structural Health Monitoring (DSSHM), combines an online, embedded ultrasonic structural health monitoring system with acoustic wavenumber spectroscopy data gathered from a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer. The combined system provides non-disruptive monitoring and high measurement fidelity necessary to drive critical decisions. Stage 1 is performed in situ (while the structure is in operation): an array of embedded ultrasonic transducers is used to excite and measure ultrasonic wave pulses in order to detect and locate irregularities within the test structure. In Stage 2, a subset of the same transducer array produces a steady-state ultrasonic response in the immediate vicinity of each structural irregularity. A laser Doppler vibrometer is then introduced to measure the full field response around that particular location in order to verify the presence of damage and provide high fidelity localization and characterization of the affected area. This document explores both the application of ultrasonic guided wave physics and the integration of sensing hardware and signal processing algorithms in implementing DSSHM.					33rd IMAC Conference and Exposition on Structural Dynamics33rd IMAC Conference and Exposition on Structural Dynamics	FEB 02-05, 2015FEB 02-05, 2015	IMAC; Soc Expt MechIMAC; Soc Expt Mech	Orlando, FLOrlando, FL	0	0	0	0	0	0			2191-5644		978-3-319-15230-1; 978-3-319-15229-5	WOS:000380565500012		
S	Atamturktur, Sez; Khan, Abdul						Niezrecki, C		Vibration-Based Scour Monitoring: Prototype Design, Laboratory Experiments and Field Deployment								Structural Health Monitoring and Damage Detection, Vol 7		Conference Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Mechanics Series						137	144		10.1007/978-3-319-15230-1_13			2015	2015	Scouring is caused by the removal of bed material surrounding the piers and abutments and can rapidly compromise the integrity of a bridge structure and cause catastrophic failure. Such failures, which occur most frequently during peak flow periods, such as flooding, are a hindrance to emergency personnel trying to enter affected areas and to individuals trying to evacuate. As a countermeasure to mitigate the effects of the bed degradation, this article presents a vibration-based scour monitoring technique. This novel approach exploits the differences between the measured low-frequency ambient excitations of a thin, flexible plate located in the flow and the same plate located in the sediment. The underlying principle is that a flexible plate excited by the turbulent flow vibrates at significantly higher amplitude compared to an identical plate placed within sediment. Laboratory and field results obtained at various flow conditions indicate that the vibration-based scour monitoring concept is able to supply reliable information regarding both scour and refill processes. This article details the underlying monitoring concept, the design and optimization of sensors, the evaluation of sensitivity of the developed sensors to environmental conditions, and their long-term field deployment.					33rd IMAC Conference and Exposition on Structural Dynamics33rd IMAC Conference and Exposition on Structural Dynamics	FEB 02-05, 2015FEB 02-05, 2015	IMAC; Soc Expt MechIMAC; Soc Expt Mech	Orlando, FLOrlando, FL	0	0	0	0	0	0			2191-5644		978-3-319-15230-1; 978-3-319-15229-5	WOS:000380565500013

IEEE					Application of Cubic Spline Interpolation in Estimating Market power under Deregulated Electricity Market								TENCON 2015 - 2015 IEEE REGION 10 CONFERENCE		TENCON IEEE Region 10 Conference Proceedings												2015	2015	In a deregulated market environment, the calculation of market power is one of the top priorities of the bodies involved in the market. The bodies generally involved such as the Generation companies (GENCOs), Distribution companies (DISCOs) look towards maximizing profit whereas the RTO/ISOs look to attain a zero market power environment.In this paper, Must Run Share and Nodal Must Run Share (NMRS) is used as an index to calculate market power. To focus upon the fast, accurate calculations and understanding the trends of market power under system changes such as various load conditions, transmission line outage and generator outage, Cubic's Spline Interpolation is used as a technique to interpolate between market powers calculated over a few operating condition set points. A demonstration of the employment of such a system is represented in this paper which will help in achieving the objectives of the players or firms involved in the electricity market. This system will be dynamic enough to suggest the operating conditions for a desired level of market power for any of the above named firms under unexpected system changes. The work is done on IEEE 14 bus test system on the MATLAB version R2012b.

IEEE					The Z-Source Breaker for Ship Power System Protection								2015 IEEE ELECTRIC SHIP TECHNOLOGIES SYMPOSIUM (ESTS)								293	298					2015	2015	The Navy is considering alternative power system architectures to traditional 60 Hz Medium Voltage Alternating Current (MVAC) power systems for shipboard operation. One alternative architecture being strongly considered for several reasons, is Medium-Voltage Direct Current (MVDC). With that consideration, comes the need for effective electrical fault risk prevention and mitigation. This paper explores the application of the recently invented "z-source dc circuit breaker" to a ship power system. Specifically, detailed simulation is used to study the response of the z-source breaker to faults at various locations in a ring-type dc power system. The addition of a central control unit results in ideal response in that only breakers necessary to isolate the fault remain open for all cases. This paper further explores implementation issues for eventual application to Navy ships.

Despite the increasing number of WWDs in the market, their limited dimensions and capabilities make their interaction design challenging. Designers struggle to downsize interactions originally designed for mobile phones, and end users wish for interactions that are easy to use. To better understand the users' concerns regarding the interaction with WWDs, we collected feedback about existing wearable bands, and analyzed the most critical issues currently faced in the interacting interaction with such devices. The analysis of the findings enabled us to derive 10 design recommendations that can aid to improve the interaction design in novel WWDs.

S	Lin, Yuhua; Shen, Haiying			IEEE					EAFR: An Energy-Efficient Adaptive File Replication System In Data-Intensive Clusters								24TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKS ICCCN 2015		IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks												2015	2015	In data intensive clusters, a large amount of files are stored, processed and transferred simultaneously. To increase the data availability, some file systems create and store three replicas for each file in randomly selected servers across different racks. However, they neglect the file heterogeneity and server heterogeneity, which can be leveraged to further enhance data availability and file system efficiency (in terms of replication delay and request response delay). As files have heterogeneous popularities, a rigid number of three replicas may not provide immediate response to an excessive number of read requests to hot files, and waste resources (including energy) for replicas of cold files that have few read requests. Also, servers are heterogeneous in network bandwidth, hardware configuration and capacity (i.e., the maximal number of service requests that can be supported simultaneously), it is crucial to select replica servers to ensure low replication delay and request response delay. In this paper, we propose an Energy-Efficient Adaptive File Replication System (EAFR), which incorporates three components. It is adaptive to time-varying file popularities to achieve a good tradeoff between data availability and efficiency. Higher popularity of a file leads to more replicas and vice versa. Also, to achieve energy efficiency, servers are classified into hot servers and cold servers with different energy consumption, and cold files are stored in cold servers. Further, EAFR selects a server with sufficient capacity (including network bandwidth and capacity) to hold a replica. Experimental results on a real-world cluster show the effectiveness of EAFR in reducing file read latency, replication time, and power consumption in large clusters.

Users post questions and pick questions to answer in the system. Due to the rapidly growing user population and the number of questions, it is unlikely for a user to stumble upon a question by chance that (s)he can answer. Also, altruism does not encourage all users to provide answers, not to mention high quality answers with a short answer wait time. The primary objective of this paper is to improve the performance of Q&A systems by actively forwarding questions to users who are capable and willing to answer the questions. To this end, we have designed and implemented SocialQ&A, an online social network based Q&A system. SocialQ&A leverages the social network properties of commoninterest and mutual-trust friend relationship to identify an asker's friends who are most likely to answer the question. We describe the architecture, algorithms and user interface of SocialQ&A, and analyze the Q&A behavior of real users and questions from a small-scale real-world SocialQ&A system. We also conducted comprehensive large-scale simulation to evaluate SocialQ&A in comparison with other methods. Our results suggest that social networks can be leveraged to improve the answer quality and asker's waiting time.

The former method may fail to find relays that can encounter the target vehicle in a large-scale VDTN while the latter method may not provide accurate location prediction due to traffic variance. Therefore, these methods cannot achieve high performance in terms of routing success rate and delay. In this paper, we aim to improve the routing performance in VDTNs. We first analyze vehicle network traces and observe that i) each vehicle has only a few active sub-areas that it frequently visits, and ii) two frequently encountered vehicles usually encounter each other in their active sub-areas. We then propose Active Area based Routing method (AAR) which consists of two steps based on the two observations correspondingly. AAR first distributes a packet copy to each active sub-area of the target vehicle using a traffic-considered shortest path spreading algorithm, and then in each sub-area, each packet carrier tries to forward the packet to a vehicle that has high encounter frequency with the target vehicle. Extensive trace-driven simulation demonstrates that AAR produces higher success rates and shorter delay in comparison with the state-of-the-art routing algorithms in VDTNs.

However, the previous algorithms neglect the connectivity of the dense subgraph since it is a challenge to give consideration to both subgraph structure and time efficiency. As a result, it may lead to isolated subgraphs in the output though they aim to find one connected dense subgraph. Also, there are lacking of efficient algorithms for big natural graphs, especially considering datasets become increasingly larger in this era of Big Data. Furthermore, previous algorithms fail to take advantage of various features of natural graphs (e.g., power-law degree distribution, homophyly of vertices, and power-law community size) which can be applied to improve the efficiency and precision of the densest subgraph discovery. To handle these problems, we design a heuristic algorithm for discovering the connected densest subgraph for massive undirected graphs in a MapReduce framework by taking advantage of the features of natural graphs. Experimental results show that our algorithm is capable of discovering the connected densest subgraph. Also, it can reduce the running times by 62% for average and discover denser subgraphs in 50% of the real datasets and 88% of the simulated datasets comparing with previous algorithm in a MapReduce framework.

PSS parameter tuning in a large interconnected system is an important and challenging problem to avoid system instability. This paper presents mean variance optimization (MVO) algorithm for PSS tuning at a control center utilizing remote synchrophasor data. The approach is illustrated on a two-area four-machine power system simulated on a real-time digital simulator (RTDS). Time domain simulation results show improved oscillation damping with PSSs tuned with MVO. Furthermore, comparison of MVO with particle swarm optimization is presented and it is observed that MVO converges faster.					2015 18th International Conference on Intelligent System Application to Power Systems (ISAP)2015 18th International Conference on Intelligent System Application to Power Systems (ISAP)	SEP 11-17, 2015SEP 11-17, 2015	Distribuicao; Inesctec Technol & Sci Associate Lab Portugal; Fac Engn Univ Port; Dept Engn Elect & Comp; Fdn Ciencia & Tecnol; IEEE Power & Energy SocDistribuicao; Inesctec Technol & Sci Associate Lab Portugal; Fac Engn Univ Port; Dept Engn Elect & Comp; Fdn Ciencia & Tecnol; IEEE Power & Energy Soc	Porto, PORTUGALPorto, PORTUGAL	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-5090-0191-0	WOS:000380395400050

How Production Bias Affects Developers' Information Foraging during Debugging								2015 31ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE AND EVOLUTION (ICSME) PROCEEDINGS								11	20					2015	2015	Developers performing maintenance activities must balance their efforts to learn the code vs. their efforts to actually change it. This balancing act is consistent with the "production bias" that, according to Carroll's minimalist learning theory, generally affects software users during everyday tasks. This suggests that developers' focus on efficiency should have marked effects on how they forage for the information they think they need to fix bugs. To investigate how developers balance fixing versus learning during debugging, we conducted the first empirical investigation of the interplay between production bias and information foraging. Our theory-based study involved 11 participants: half tasked with fixing a bug, and half tasked with learning enough to help someone else fix it. Despite the subtlety of difference between their tasks, participants foraged remarkably differently-making foraging decisions from different types of "patches," with different types of information, and succeeding with different foraging tactics.

Since clouds have diverse groups of users with different sets of security requirements, restricting the users' accesses and protecting information from unauthorized accesses have become the most difficult tasks. To address these critical challenges, in this paper we first formalize Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) and propose a new access control model, called Attribute-Rule ABAC (AR-ABAC), for cloud computing to meet critical access control requirements in clouds. Our model supports the attributer-rules that deal with the association between users and objects, as well as the capability for accessing objects based on their sensitivity levels. The attribute-rules specify an agreement that determines what kind of attributes should be used and the number of attributes considered for making access decisions. In addition, our model ensures secure resource sharing among potential untrusted tenants and supports different access permissions to the same user at the same session.

Users also have specific security requirements to protect their VNs. Especially, due to changeable network perimeters, constant VM migrations, and usercentric security needs, VNs require new security features that traditional firewalls fail to provide, because traditional firewalls rely greatly on restricted network topology and entry points to provide effective security protection. To address this challenge, we propose VNGuard, a framework for effective provision and management of virtual firewalls to safeguard VNs, leveraging features provided by NFV and Software Defined Networking (SDN). VNGuard defines a high-level firewall policy language, finds optimal virtual firewall placement, and adapts virtual firewalls to VN changes. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we have implemented core components of VNGuard on top of ClickOS. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of virtual firewalls built on VNGuard.

To handle these problems, we introduce a trust management system, called SocialLink, that utilizes social network and historical transaction links. SocialLink manages file transactions through both the social network and a novel weighted transaction network, which is built based on previous file transaction history. First, SocialLink exploits the trust among friends in social networks by enabling two friends to share files directly. Second, the weighted transaction network is utilized to 1) deduce the trust of the client on a server in reliably providing the requested file and 2) check the fairness of the transaction. In this way, SocialLink prevents potential misbehaving transactions (i.e., providing faulty files), encourages nodes to contribute file resources to non-friends, and avoids free-riding. Furthermore, the weighted transaction network helps SocialLink resist whitewashing, collusion and Sybil attacks. Extensive simulation demonstrates that SocialLink can efficiently ensure trustable and fair P2P file sharing and resist the aforementioned attacks.

J	Lin, Yuhua; Shen, Haiying			IEEE					AutoTune: Game-based Adaptive Bitrate Streaming in P2P-Assisted Cloud-Based VoD Systems								2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PEER-TO-PEER COMPUTING (P2P)														2015	2015	Hybrid peer-to-peer assisted cloud-based video-on-demand (VoD) systems augment cloud-based VoD systems with P2P networks to improve scalability and save bandwidth costs in the cloud. In these systems, the VoD service provider (e.g., NetFlix) relies on the cloud to deliver videos to users and pays for the cloud bandwidth consumption. The users can download videos from both the cloud and peers in the P2P network. It is important for VoD service provider to i) minimize the cloud bandwidth consumption, and ii) guarantee users' satisfaction (i.e., quality-of-experience). Though previous adaptive bitrate streaming (ABR) methods improve video playback smoothness, they cannot achieve these two goals simultaneously. To tackle this challenge, we propose AutoTune, a game-based adaptive bitrate streaming method. In AutoTune, we formulate the bitrate adaptation problem in ABR as a noncooperative Stackelberg game, where VoD service provider and the users are players. The VoD service provider acts as a leader and it decides the VoD service price for users with the objective of minimizing cloud bandwidth consumption while ensuring users' participation. In response to the VoD service price, the users select video bitrates that lead to maximum utility (defined as a function of its satisfaction minus associated VoD service fee). Finally, the Stackelberg equilibrium is reached in which the cloud bandwidth consumption is minimized while users are satisfied with selected video bitrates. Experimental results from the PeerSim simulator and the PlanetLab real-world testbed show that compared to existing methods, AutoTune can provide high user satisfaction and save cloud bandwidth consumption.

Recent research efforts begin to study social-based Q&A systems that rely on an asker's social friends to provide answers. However, this method cannot find answerers for a question not belonging to the asker's interests. To solve this problem, we propose a distributed Q&A system incorporating both social community intelligence and global collective intelligence, named as iASK. iASK improves the response latency and answer quality in both the social domain and global domain. It uses a neural network based friend ranking method to identify answerer candidates by considering social closeness and Q&A activities. To efficiently identify answerers in the global user base, iASK builds a virtual server tree that embeds the hierarchical structure of interests, and also maps users to the tree based on user interests. To accurately locate the cooperative experts, iASK has a fine-grained reputation system to evaluate user reputation based on their cooperativeness and expertise. Experimental results from large-scale trace-driven simulation and realworld daily usages of the iASK prototype show the superior performance of iASK. It achieves high answer quality with 24% higher accuracy, short response latency with 53% less delay and effective cooperative incentives with 16% more answers compared to other social-based Q&A systems.

J	Liu, Guoxin; Shen, Haiying			IEEE					Deadline Guaranteed Service for Multi-Tenant Cloud Storage								2015 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PEER-TO-PEER COMPUTING (P2P)														2015	2015	It is imperative for cloud storage systems to be able to provide deadline guaranteed services according to service level agreements (SLAs) for online services. However, there are no previous works that provide the deadline guarantee specifically for cloud storage systems. In this paper, we introduce a new form of SLAs, which enables each tenant to specify a percentage of its requests it wishes to serve within a specified deadline. We first identify the multiple objectives (i. e., traffic and latency minimization, resource utilization maximization) in developing schemes to satisfy the SLAs. To satisfy the SLAs while achieving the multi-objectives, we propose a Parallel Deadline Guaranteed (PDG) scheme, which schedules data reallocation (through load re-assignment and data replication) using a tree-based bottom-up parallel process. We also enhance PDG through a prioritized data reallocation algorithm, which enables highly overloaded servers to autonomously probe nearby servers and enables the load balancer to instantly handle them. Our trace-driven experiments on a simulator show the effectiveness of our schemes for guaranteeing the SLAs while achieving the multi-objectives.

However, IPv6-based Wireless sensor networks are vulnerable to a harmful attack known as the wormhole attack, where a malicious node overhears data packet at one location and tunnels it to a colluding node, which replays it locally. This can have a negative influence on the routing mechanism by preventing nodes from discovering the normal routes. In this paper, we present a secure routing mechanism against wormhole attack in IPv6-based wireless sensor networks. The design of this routing mechanism can be divided into two phases-wormhole detection and defense, which is based on the average distance per hop in the network and the TTL of IP header. Besides, our proposal does not require special hardware or high computation and storage capacity of the node, which is quite suitable for the resource-constrained IPv6-based wireless sensor networks. The simulation results show that our proposal is effective under the conditions of different network topology and wormhole parameters.

Unquestionably, emergence of IoT (Internet of things) technology contributes to the development of medical healthcare informatization. Yet, it is widely researched and accepted that privacy protection has become a bottleneck of smart medical healthcare nowadays. Consequently, how to protect the privacy of users' information in a smart healthcare system remains a pending problem. Under this background, this paper analyses the main problems in current smart healthcare system. Furthermore, a lightweight private homomorphism algorithm and an encryption algorithm improved from DES are designed when considering the characteristic of IoT and privacy protection. Finally, based on the above, we designed and completed a prototype system based on both software and hardware.

In many organizations, employees have to remain accessible and respond to these technology-mediated (T-M) interruptions even after regular work hours. At the same time, most employees have limited freedom to decide how and when they accomplish their tasks, a work condition that renders the explosion of T-M interruptions problematic. When people have limited control over their work environment, they cannot adapt their work schedules and methods to the additional demands from T-M interruptions, potentially leading them to be stressed and, in turn, to shy away from using the technologies that create these interruptions. Hence, we propose that demands from T-M interruptions negatively affect work-related IT-usage via workers' experiences of stress and that this indirect effect depends on worker control. Psychological and physiological data (salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase) will be collected and analyzed through advanced procedures for testing moderated-mediation effects.

To handle this problem, load balancing methods are needed to reduce the number of overloaded servers due to computing workloads. However, current load balancing methods either do not consider the computing workload or assume that it is proportional to the number of data blocks in a server. Through trace analysis, we demonstrate the diversity of computing workloads of different tasks and the necessity of balancing the computing workloads among servers. Then, we propose a cost-efficient Computing load Aware and Long-View load balancing approach (CALV). In addition to the computing load awareness, CALV is also novel in that it achieves long-term load balance by migrating out data blocks from an overloaded server that contribute more computing workloads when the server is more overloaded and contribute less computing workloads when the server is more underloaded at different epochs during a time period. CALV also has a lazy data block transmission method to improve the load balanced state and avoid network load peak. Trace-driven experiments in simulation and a real computing cluster show that CALV outperforms other methods in terms of balancing the computing workloads and cost efficiency.

CSBs buy the cloud resources, i.e., servers, with lower prices from cloud providers and sell the resources to the tenants with higher prices. To maximize its own profit, a CSB may distribute tenants' requests to the clouds that waste energy resources. However, as energy costs of cloud computing have been increasing rapidly, there is a need for cloud providers to optimize energy efficiency while maintain high service level performance to tenants, not only for their own benefit but also for social welfares (e.g., protecting environment). Thus, for green cloud companies, two questions have arisen: 1) under what pricing policies from the cloud providers to the CSB, a profit-driven CSB is willing to minimize the total cloud energy cost while satisfy tenant demands and 2) how should a CSB distribute tenants' demands to achieve this objective? To address question 1), we find a pricing policy for cloud providers such that maximizing CSB's profit is equivalent to minimizing cloud providers' energy cost. To address question 2), we first devise a greedy solution, and then propose an approximation algorithm with a constant approximation ratio. Both simulation and real-world Amazon EC2 experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our pricing policy to incentivize CSBs to save energy for cloud providers and the superior performance of our algorithms in energy efficiency and resource utilizations in comparison with the previous algorithms.

Connected, mobile and Internet of Things devices and machines generate immense amounts of sensor data. The ability to process and analyze this data to extract insights and knowledge that enable intelligent services, new ways to understand business problems, improvements of processes and decisions, is a critical capability. Hadoop is a scalable platform for compute and storage and emerged as de-facto standard for Big Data processing at Internet companies and in the scientific community. However, there is a lack of understanding of how and for what use cases these new Hadoop capabilities can be efficiently used to augment automotive applications and systems. This paper surveys use cases and applications for deploying Hadoop in the automotive industry.Over the years a rich ecosystem emerged around Hadoop comprising tools for parallel, in-memory and stream processing (most notable MapReduce and Spark), SQL and NOSQL engines (Hive, HBase), and machine learning (Mahout, MLlib). It is critical to develop an understanding of automotive applications and their characteristics and requirements for data discovery, integration, exploration and analytics. We then map these requirements to a confined technical architecture consisting of core Hadoop services and libraries for data ingest, processing and analytics. The objective of this paper is to address questions, such as: What applications and datasets are suitable for Hadoop? How can a diverse set of frameworks and tools be managed on multi-tenant Hadoop cluster? How do these tools integrate with existing relational data management systems? How can enterprise security requirements be addressed? What are the performance characteristics of these tools for real-world automotive applications? To address the last question, we utilize a standard benchmark (TPCx-HS), and two application benchmarks (SQL and machine learning) that operate on a dataset of multiple Terabytes and billions of rows.

The Atlantic coast and Gulf of Mexico of the U.S., with large wind resources and proximity to major population centers, are natural places for such development; however, these regions are also at considerable risk from severe hurricanes or tropical cyclones. Current international guidelines for the design of offshore wind turbines (OWTs) do not explicitly consider loading under hurricane conditions, however subsequent editions are anticipated to include language specific to hurricanes. Variability in extreme loads is greater in areas where hurricanes are likely and the design loads and risk profile of offshore structures installed in such areas are expected to be strongly influenced by hurricanes. For many offshore structures, environmental conditions at design recurrence periods and beyond are often estimated through extrapolation of long-term (i.e. multiple decades) wind and wave measurements from buoys, however, for offshore structures located at areas exposed to hurricanes, it is accepted practice to use physics-based models to augment the historical record of Atlantic hurricane activity and generate a stochastic catalog of synthetic hurricanes that provides tens of thousands of realizations for one year of potential hurricane activity. Once a stochastic catalog has been established, appropriate hazard intensity measures (e.g. the one minute sustained wind speed, the significant wave height, and the peak spectral wave period) can be estimated for each storm at any site using well-known wind and wave parametric models. In this study, we consider several sites along the Atlantic coast and quantify the impact of estimating hazard for design recurrence periods and beyond for three different methods. The first is based on an extrapolation of wind and wave measurements from buoys, and the second and third are based on a stochastic catalog of synthetic hurricanes with wind and wave intensities estimated based on deterministic and probabilistic relationships.					34th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE2015)34th ASME International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering (OMAE2015)	MAY 31-JUN 05, 2015MAY 31-JUN 05, 2015	Amer Soc Mech Engn, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn DivAmer Soc Mech Engn, Ocean Offshore & Arct Engn Div	St John's, CANADASt John's, CANADA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-5657-4	WOS:000379793600059

Two trials were carried out under a mist system with controlled temperature and air relative humidity. Cuttings (12 cm long, 6-12 mm in diameter) with half-leaves on three top nodes were prepared and placed in bottom perforated, plastic boxes (53 x 26 x 6.5 cm) filled with course vermiculite. The first trial was done with softwood cuttings (June-July, 2011) in a completely randomized 3x3x2 factorial design [rootstocks: 'Krymsk (R) 86', 'Lovell' and Prunus americana; indole-3-butiric acid (IBA) concentrations: 0, 3,000 and 6,000 ppm; and IBA sources: IBA and IBA-K salt]. Semi-hardwood cuttings (August-September, 2011) were used for the second trial, which was a completely randomized 3x3 factorial design (rootstocks: 'Guardian (R)', 'Krymsk (R) 86' and P. munsoniana; and IBA concentrations: 0, 3,000 and 6,000 ppm). There were significant differences among genotypes for all variables related to rooted cutting percentage, root quality, and new shoot formation, with the best results for 'Krymsk (R) 86'. This genotype can be propagated by softwood or semi-hardwood cuttings even without IBA. Vegetative buds on softwood cuttings of 'Lovell' and semi-hardwood cuttings of 'Guardian (R)' (both P. persica) did not break while under mist system. A unique effect of the IBA-K salt was to decrease root dry mass. Softwood cuttings of 'Lovell' or P. americana and semi-hardwood cuttings of 'Guardian (R)' should be treated with IBA at 3,000 ppm.					8th International Peach Symposium8th International Peach Symposium	JUN 17-20, 2013-2016JUN 17-20, 2013-2016	Int Soc Hort SciInt Soc Hort Sci	Matera, ITALYMatera, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-94-62610-79-8	WOS:000378619300005

A management option for control and meeting consumer demand for chemical-free, environmentally friendly fruit production is the development of resistant or tolerant cultivars. Resistance to bacterial spot in peach cultivars is apparently under polygenic control. Several controlling loci in the peach genome conferring quantitative resistance were recently discovered in an F-2 population. The two quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with the largest effects on bacterial spot resistance in peach fruit, Xap. Pp. OC-1.2 and Xap. Pp. OC-6.1, were validated here in a large collection of U.S. peach breeding germplasm (Prunus persica and some closely related species). High-resolution genome scans of this germplasm conducted within the RosBREED project were associated with phenotypic data on fruit bacterial spot resistance to determine effects and distributions of functional alleles. This resulting predictive DNA information has immediate application in U.S. peach breeding.					8th International Peach Symposium8th International Peach Symposium	JUN 17-20, 2013-2016JUN 17-20, 2013-2016	Int Soc Hort SciInt Soc Hort Sci	Matera, ITALYMatera, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-94-62610-79-8	WOS:000378619300007

It is well documented that rootstocks are associated with the syndrome. Several Prunus genotypes are being studied at Embrapa Temperate Agriculture as rootstocks for PTSL tolerance for Southern Brazil. Prunus mume has been reported as resistant to Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Meloidogyne javanica and M. incognita, and shows some tolerance to drought. In this trial, four peach cultivars were budded on 550 Prunus mume seedlings and planted in a field with PTSL history. In 2012, 49 trees were selected and the following variables were registered: trunk diameter (TD), trunk cross-sectional area (TCSA), fruit number/tree before thinning (FNBT) and at harvest time (FNHT), yield/tree (Y), fruit set (FSE) and yield efficiency (YE), fruit weight (FW), longitudinal (LFD) and transversal fruit diameter (TFD), soluble solids content (SSC) and firmness (F). No PTSL symptoms were observed on peach/P. mume trees in the first three years after planting. Several differences related to tree development, yield, yield efficiency and fruit quality were observed among plants on the 49 selected P. mume seedlings.

'Redhaven' peach trees grafted to 17 rootstocks were planted in a randomized block design with 8 replications in 2009 at the Western Colorado Research Center. One of the objectives of this study was to evaluate the performance of the trees under Colorado climatic and edaphic conditions. Tree growth measurements and survival were recorded each year. By the third year after planting, trees showed different levels of foliar chlorosis probably caused by micronutrient deficiency aggravated by high soil pH. These trees were rated for chlorosis based on visual observation (0-10 scale) where 0= no chlorosis to 10 having almost total canopy chlorosis in appearance. Fruit data collected in the third year showed a significant (P=<0.0001 and r(2)=0.59) impact of rootstocks on chlorosis where trees on different rootstocks produced different levels of chlorosis. The highest chlorosis was observed with 'HBOK 10', followed by 'KV010-123', and 'KV010-127'; whereas many trees on rootstocks such as 'Viking', 'Atlas', 'Guardian (R)', 'Mirobac' (aka 'Replantpac') had lower chlorosis levels and most of the others were intermediate. Tree circumference was significantly affected by the chlorosis (P=0.004). There was no impact of chlorosis on total fruit yield per tree, total number of fruits per tree, individual fruit weight, or incidence and severity of Cytospora canker among the trees grafted to different rootstocks. Trees on rootstocks such as 'Atlas', 'Fortuna', and 'Mirobac' had 100% disease infection. The majority of rootstocks had at least 12.5% tree death except 'Viking', which had 50% mortality. Tree death on 'Viking' occurred during the first year after planting; whereas most other trees on different rootstocks died in the second and third year due to Cytospora Canker.					8th International Peach Symposium8th International Peach Symposium	JUN 17-20, 2013-2016JUN 17-20, 2013-2016	Int Soc Hort SciInt Soc Hort Sci	Matera, ITALYMatera, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-94-62610-79-8	WOS:000378619300021

Trees were spaced 3.7 m (+PLMVd), 4.3 m (+PLMVd), or 4.9 m (-PLMVd) within rows that were 6.1 m apart with each plot consisting of 6 orchard rows. There were 2 replications. Trees were trained to an open-center system and were located near Ridge Spring, South Carolina. Data collection included time to summer prune and dormant prune trees, time to hand thin immature fruit, ripening date, harvest period, fruit yield, fruit size, and fruit quality for some or all of the years of 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013.PLMVd-inoculated trees bloomed 5-14 days later, and took less time to dormant prune viroid-free control trees. Time to hand thin viroid-infected trees was significantly more (2 min/tree) than controls in 2008 due to excessive buttons and doubles, but took 6, 5, and 2.5 min/tree less in 2009, 2010 and 2011, respectively.PLMVd delayed ripening 5-14 days, and total length of the harvest period including controls ranged from 16-26 days. Yields per hectare from PLMVd trees declined from 116% of control yields in 2006 to 68 and 42 percent in 2008 and 2009, respectively, years where weather prolonged bloom 13-14 days. PLMVd trees did yield 4% and 1% better, though statistically non-significant, in 2010 and 2011, respectively. There was no commercial crop on PLMVd trees in 2012 due to fruit buttoning from a low chilling winter and/or high bloom temperatures (>29 degrees C). Peak harvest dates in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 for PLMVd trees were 7, 9, 4 and 9 days later, respectively. Fruit size was smaller from PLMVd trees in 2006 and 2010, but larger in 2008, 2009 and 2011. Fruit from PLMVd trees had similar soluble solids as the controls but had significantly higher titrated acidity and were firmer. In some years peach warts, which are symptoms of peach viroids, were common on the fruit sutures of viroid-infected fruit.					8th International Peach Symposium8th International Peach Symposium	JUN 17-20, 2013-2016JUN 17-20, 2013-2016	Int Soc Hort SciInt Soc Hort Sci	Matera, ITALYMatera, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-94-62610-79-8	WOS:000378619300031

After four years at 14 locations, significant differences among rootstocks and sites were found for survival, root suckers, growth, bloom date, fruit maturity date, fruit size, cumulative yield, and yield efficiency. Tree survival was high (>96%) in the states MA, CA, SC and UT and low (<78%) in MO and NC (bacterial canker). Imperial California had the lowest overall survival (48%) followed by Fortuna and Krymsk (R) 1. Rootstock suckering was excessive on Prunus americana seedlings with Krymsk (R) 1 a distant second. The largest trees were in CA, NY, MO and SC, while the smallest trees were in CO and UT, both high elevation mountain states with calcareous soils. Tree TCSAs were largest on Bright's Hybrid #5, Guardian (R), Viking, Krymsk (R) 86 and Atlas, whereas TCSAs of trees on Krymsk (R) 1, Controller 5, P. americana and Fortuna were the smallest. The earliest bloom by 1-2 days in both years occurred on Bright's Hybrid #5 and KV010127 rootstocks. Trees on P. americana and Fortuna bloomed 1-3 days later than the average in 2011 and 2012.Fruit maturity dates varied by 59 and 52 days across sites in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Among rootstocks and years, fruit maturity was advanced up to 2.5 days and delayed as much as 3.5 days, when compared to Lovell. Bright's Hybrid #5 and KV010127 advanced maturity, and Penta and HBOK 32 delayed maturity in both years. Fruit size was largest (192 to 231 g) in SC, UT and CA and smallest (117 to 154 g) in GA and NC for both years. Empyrean (R) 3, Atlas, Empyrean (R) 2, Bright's Hybrid #5, Guardian (R) and Viking produced the largest fruit and Fortuna the smallest.Cumulative yields were highest in CA, NY, MO and MA and lowest in CO and IL. The highest yields were on the vigorous peach and peach hybrid rootstocks. Also, rootstocks with the highest yield efficiency were Krymsk (R) 1, HBOK 10, P. americana, HBOK 32, and Controller (TM) 5.					8th International Peach Symposium8th International Peach Symposium	JUN 17-20, 2013-2016JUN 17-20, 2013-2016	Int Soc Hort SciInt Soc Hort Sci	Matera, ITALYMatera, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-94-62610-79-8	WOS:000378619300032

Studies were conducted to understand the impact of reduced water in peach production and fruit quality that might help to manage chlorosis. Two field experiments were conducted in 2011 and 2012 in 'Cresthaven' and 'Redhaven' peaches, respectively at the Western Colorado Research Center, Grand Junction, CO. In 2011, a randomized block design with five different treatments, irrigation set for 12 hours (control) and 6 hours, and set on a - 1,000, -1,500 and -2,000 millibar (mb) trigger, were applied and replicated 4 times. In 2012 slightly different treatments of triggering irrigation at -1,000 mb, -1,500 mb, 2,000 mb, for a preset 12 hour period, and for 24 hours equal to a grower standard (control) were tested and replicated three times. In both years, two trees per replication were selected for observation where the water was monitored at a weekly interval until fruit ripening. Fruits were harvested twice during normal harvest, and total number of fruits and total fruit weight per tree were recorded. Five random fruits in each treatment were randomly selected for fruit quality analysis. Individual fruit weight, fruit size, brix, pH, and acid content were measured. The fruit firmness was tested on the sun and shade sides of a single randomly selected fruit out of the five fruits selected for fruit quality. The data were analyzed and mean comparisons done by SAS. The results indicated that there was no impact of irrigation practices tested on fruit number, total weight, size, brix, tartaric acid, and firmness in both the cultivars. This clearly indicated that limiting water is possible without impacting fruit production and quality. This will help growers to overcome iron chlorosis by reducing irrigation with high pH water.					8th International Peach Symposium8th International Peach Symposium	JUN 17-20, 2013-2016JUN 17-20, 2013-2016	Int Soc Hort SciInt Soc Hort Sci	Matera, ITALYMatera, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-94-62610-79-8	WOS:000378619300058

Often times, however, they are overwhelmed by the vast amount of disparate information from varied sources that exists on the Internet. These same individuals are typically time-limited, sometimes they may lack technical savvy, and they may get frustrated when searching for meaningful content. In July of 2010, we launched a new peach website at Clemson University called "Everything About Peaches" (http://www.clemson.edu/peach). The goal of this website was to create a "one-stop-shop" for peach information that could be helpful for the commercial grower, backyard grower, and consumer. Since its inception, the site has been regularly populated with diverse content and links to reach the aforementioned audiences. Resources include research and technical reports, production and management guides, topical educational columns, frequently asked questions and answers, recipes, etc. There is a section called "In the News" that features numerous interviews and stories (local, regional, national and international). Another section entitled "Videos" has 50 educational videos ranging from topics about cultivars, to maturity management, recognizing orchard stress, etc. The videos have been viewed more than 60,000 times by individuals from around the world. There is an "Audio" section with radio interviews (statewide and national). There is also a germplasm/variety evaluation searchable database with performance data of more than 300 cultivars and advanced selections over more than 10 years at four different locations. The entire website can be searched for content by keyword. Finally, in 2011, we launched both Facebook and Twitter to grow our user community and to engage with them using contemporary social media networking. Both the Facebook (Facebook.com/peachdoctor) and Twitter (twitter.com/peachdoctor) feeds appear on the aforementioned website as well.					8th International Peach Symposium8th International Peach Symposium	JUN 17-20, 2013-2016JUN 17-20, 2013-2016	Int Soc Hort SciInt Soc Hort Sci	Matera, ITALYMatera, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-94-62610-79-8	WOS:000378619300059

Xiloyannis, C; Inglese, P; Montanaro, G		Environmental Effects on Fruit Ripening and Average Fruit Weight for Three Peach Cultivars								VIII INTERNATIONAL PEACH SYMPOSIUM		Acta Horticulturae		1084				453	458					2015	2015	Three peach cultivars, 'Crimson Lady' (early), 'Redhaven' (mid-season) and 'Cresthaven' (late), were planted at twelve locations within the USA in 2009. All trees were grafted on 'Lovell' rootstock and came from the same nursery. Five trees of each cultivar were planted at a spacing of 6 m by 5 m at each location. In 2012, eight locations were able to participate in the study. In order to obtain maximum fruit growth, trees were thinned to about 40-50 fruit within 30-40 days of bloom, were irrigated when needed and kept free of diseases and pests. When fruit started to soften (tree ripe), a first harvest was initiated. The second, and last, harvest occurred about one week later. Individual fruit were weighed and a composite sample per tree was used to measure percent soluble solids content (SSC) with a refractometer. Daily weather parameters of maximum and minimum temperatures, solar radiation, precipitation and average humidity were measured in close proximity to the orchard. Full bloom dates ranged from early March to early May for the different locations. Time from full bloom to harvest varied by about 30 days among locations for all three cultivars. This parameter correlated very well with average temperature (average of daily maximum and minimum) for 60 days after bloom. Correlation coefficients were -0.94, -0.96 and -0.98 for the three cultivars, respectively. Average fruit weight varied among sites from 141 g to 216 g for 'Crimson Lady', 159 g to 313 g for 'Redhaven' and 152 g to 413 g for 'Cresthaven'. This parameter correlated well with average solar radiation from bloom to harvest for 'Redhaven' (r = 0.87) and 'Cresthaven' (r = 0.73), but not 'Crimson Lady'. The relationship with 'Cresthaven' was significantly improved by adding in the factor of average temperature for 20 days after bloom (r(2) = 0.91). Cooler temperatures were associated with larger fruit. No weather parameters correlated well with 'Crimson Lady' fruit weight or with SSC for any of the three cultivars. The study will continue for at least 2 more years to obtain more robust relationships.					8th International Peach Symposium8th International Peach Symposium	JUN 17-20, 2013-2016JUN 17-20, 2013-2016	Int Soc Hort SciInt Soc Hort Sci	Matera, ITALYMatera, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-94-62610-79-8	WOS:000378619300062

A model based on growing degree days calculated from a base temperature of 7 degrees C has been used to predict harvest dates in California with positive results. However, this model has not been applied to other climates, specifically the southeastern U.S. The objective of this research was to predict harvest dates for peach cultivars using a Growing Degree Day formula based on temperatures for the first 30 days after flowering. Three formulas were used to calculate Growing Degree Days so that a comparison could be made to find the model that best suited South Carolina. Two of these models, the BE (or Baskerville-Emin method) and the Averaging Method, require average daily temperatures, and the third requires hourly temperatures to complete a prediction. The method commonly used in California was the BE method. We found this method to be the simplest and most effective model to use for our conditions. This method was applied to two locations in South Carolina that experience different temperature patterns to further test its capability to predict fruit maturity under diverse climatic conditions. Five cultivars were tested in the South Carolina Piedmont near Clemson University, and eleven cultivars were tested near Ridge Spring, South Carolina, which borders the Piedmont and Sandhills geographic regions. It was hypothesized that high temperatures during the first 30 days after bloom would result in an earlier harvest date. The results from these two regions were in accordance with the expected outcome with highly significant regression coefficients of r=.979, r=.984 and r=.984 for early, mid, and late season cultivars, respectively. However, the early and mid-season cultivars in the cooler Piedmont test location had a more negative association (earlier maturity with high post-bloom temperatures) than those at the warmer Ridge Spring location.					8th International Peach Symposium8th International Peach Symposium	JUN 17-20, 2013-2016JUN 17-20, 2013-2016	Int Soc Hort SciInt Soc Hort Sci	Matera, ITALYMatera, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-94-62610-79-8	WOS:000378619300100

However, early spring temperatures during and after bloom are not actively tracked to see if they affect future growth potential of peach fruit. Growing degree days or hours (GDD/GDH) have been used previously with a Relative Growth Rate (RGR) Fruit Model to estimate fruit growth potential and to provide a decision making tool for cultural practices such as timing of thinning for specific cultivars. Weather data were converted via the "Averaging Method" to growing degree days base 7 degrees C for 30 days post-bloom for years 2002-2010 at Ridge Spring, South Carolina. Percent packout for number one fruit, 70 mm or greater, was collected from a packing-house for 30 cultivars. Years 2004, 2005 and 2008 were above average years for larger fruit size and 2002, 2009 and 2010 were below average fruit size years. Packout for large fruit sizes in years with GDD of 468 or less 30 days post-bloom were not affected. However, years that GDD were near 700 at 30 days post-bloom had significantly less large (>70 mm) fruit packed. GDD greater than 494 the first 30 days post-bloom resulted in less than 60% packout of large fruit in the years studied suggesting that potential fruit size may be lost unless early flower/fruitlet thinning is initiated under warm post-bloom temperatures.					8th International Peach Symposium8th International Peach Symposium	JUN 17-20, 2013-2016JUN 17-20, 2013-2016	Int Soc Hort SciInt Soc Hort Sci	Matera, ITALYMatera, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-94-62610-79-8	WOS:000378619300101		
J	Chong, Juang-Horng								Species Richness and Seasonal Abundance of Billbugs, Sphenophorus spp., from South Carolina Golf Courses								Journal of Agricultural and Urban Entomology				31	1			20	28					2015	2015	Species richness and seasonal abundance of billbugs (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) were determined for four golf courses in South Carolina. In 2009 and 2010, 3970 adult billbugs representing six species were collected with unbaited pitfall traps. Sphenophorus inaequalis (Say) and S. venatus vestitus Chittenden represented 95% of the billbugs collected, whereas S. coesifrons Gyllenhal, S. parvulus Gyllenhal, S. cariosus (Olivier), and S. minimus Hart composed the remainder of the billbugs captured. Adult billbugs were collected from March to December, with a sex ratio of roughly 1:1. More individuals of S. venatus vestitus and S. inaequalis were collected from March to July and August to November, suggesting two overlapping generations annually. Given the extended activity period, at least two insecticide applications may be needed to reduce the abundance of larvae and adults.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1523-5475	2153-652X		BCI:BCI201600602767

Evaluation of Treatment Thresholds for Helicoverpa zea (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in Non-Bt and Dual-Gene Bt Cotton								Journal of Agricultural and Urban Entomology				31	1			29	46					2015	2015	Transgenic cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L. (Malvales: Malvaceae), that produces two Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner (Bt) (Bacillales: Bacillaceae) toxins has reduced the need for insecticide treatments for bollworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), compared with single-gene Bt traits. Field trials were conducted in an area prone to high pressure from H. zea in South Carolina in 2010 and 2011 to develop action thresholds for this species in dual-gene Bt Bollgard II and WideStrike cotton. Plots containing non-Bt, WideStrike, and Bollgard II cotton varieties were examined weekly and treated according to threshold protocols for one of the following: bollworm eggs, larvae in white blooms, or boll damage. Although insecticide applications targeting H. zea increased yield in non-Bt cotton, differences in yield among the thresholds evaluated were not statistically evident when insecticides were applied within the sets of Bt traits. Insecticide applications exclusively targeting H. zea were not necessary in dual-gene Bt cotton. More H. zea larvae and damage occurred in WideStrike cotton compared with Bollgard II; however, lint yields for dual-gene Bt cotton did not differ among thresholds and did not support implementing protection strategies unique to each set of traits.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1523-5475	2153-652X		BCI:BCI201600602768

The first challenge is workload data storage. Thousands of small data size jobs in a workload may overload the limited local disks of scale-up machines. Jobs from scale-up and scale-out machines may both request the same set of data, which leads to data transmission between the machines. The second challenge is to automatically schedule jobs to either scale-up or scale-out cluster to achieve the best performance. We conduct a thorough performance measurement of different applications on scale-up and scale-out clusters, configured with Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and a remote file system (i.e., OFS), respectively. We find that using OFS rather than HDFS can solve the data storage challenge. Also, we identify the factors that determine the performance differences on the scale-up and scale-out clusters and their cross points to make the choice. Accordingly, we design and implement the hybrid scale-up/out Hadoop architecture. Our trace-driven experimental results show that our hybrid architecture outperforms both the traditional Hadoop architecture with HDFS and with OFS in terms of job completion time.					44th Annual International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops (ICPPW)44th Annual International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops (ICPPW)	SEP 01-04, 2015SEP 01-04, 2015	IEEE Comp Soc; Int Conf Parallel Proc; Tsinghua Univ; Int Assoc Comp & Commun; Baidu; Tsinghua Natl Lab Informat Sci & TechnolIEEE Comp Soc; Int Conf Parallel Proc; Tsinghua Univ; Int Assoc Comp & Commun; Baidu; Tsinghua Natl Lab Informat Sci & Technol	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINABeijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0190-3918		978-1-4673-7588-7	WOS:000379202700003

It introduces an additional layer of abstraction that produces resource utilization overhead. Disregarding this overhead may cause serious reduction of the monitoring accuracy of the cloud providers and may cause degradation of the VM performance. However, there is no previous work that comprehensively investigates the virtualization overhead. In this paper, we comprehensively measure and study the relationship between the resource utilizations of virtual machines (VMs) and the resource utilizations of the device driver domain, hypervisor and the physical machine (PM) with diverse workloads and scenarios in the Xen virtualization environment. We examine data from the real-world virtualized deployment to characterize VM workloads and assess their impact on the resource utilizations in the system. We show that the impact of virtualization overhead depends on the workloads, and that virtualization overhead is an important factor to consider in cloud resource provisioning. Based on the measurements, we build a regression model to estimate the resource utilization overhead of the PM resulting from providing virtualized resource to the VMs and from managing multiple VMs. Finally, our trace-driven real-world experimental results show the high accuracy of our model in predicting PM resource consumptions in the cloud datacenter, and the importance of considering the virtualization overhead in cloud resource provisioning.					44th Annual International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops (ICPPW)44th Annual International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops (ICPPW)	SEP 01-04, 2015SEP 01-04, 2015	IEEE Comp Soc; Int Conf Parallel Proc; Tsinghua Univ; Int Assoc Comp & Commun; Baidu; Tsinghua Natl Lab Informat Sci & TechnolIEEE Comp Soc; Int Conf Parallel Proc; Tsinghua Univ; Int Assoc Comp & Commun; Baidu; Tsinghua Natl Lab Informat Sci & Technol	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINABeijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0190-3918		978-1-4673-7588-7	WOS:000379202700004

To this end, we first incorporate a channel model, called energy-demand functions, to the current TVGs, namely time-varying energy-demand graphs (TVEGs). Based on this model, we formulate the problem: given a TVEG, what is the optimal schedule (i.e., which nodes should forward a packet in what times and at what power levels) to minimize the energy consumption of the broadcast? We prove the problem to be NP-hard and o(log N) inapproximable. It is a challenge to find a solution for this problem on continuous time. Fortunately, we prove that the problem on continuous time is equivalent to the problem on certain discrete time points, called discrete time set (DTS). Based on this property, we propose polynomial time solutions for this problem with different channel models, and evaluate the performance of these methods from real-life contact traces.					44th Annual International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops (ICPPW)44th Annual International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops (ICPPW)	SEP 01-04, 2015SEP 01-04, 2015	IEEE Comp Soc; Int Conf Parallel Proc; Tsinghua Univ; Int Assoc Comp & Commun; Baidu; Tsinghua Natl Lab Informat Sci & TechnolIEEE Comp Soc; Int Conf Parallel Proc; Tsinghua Univ; Int Assoc Comp & Commun; Baidu; Tsinghua Natl Lab Informat Sci & Technol	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINABeijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	1	0	0	0	0	1			0190-3918		978-1-4673-7588-7	WOS:000379202700020

However, as the graphics rendering is offloaded to the cloud, the data transmission between the end-users and the cloud significantly increases the response latency and limits the user coverage, thus preventing cloud gaming to achieve high user Quality of Experience (QoE). To solve this problem, previous research suggested deploying more datacenters, but it comes at a prohibitive cost. We propose a lightweight system called CloudFog, which incorporates "fog" consisting of supernodes that are responsible for rendering game videos and streaming them to their nearby players. Fog enables the cloud to be only responsible for the intensive game state computation and sending update information to supernodes, which significantly reduce the traffic hence the latency and bandwidth consumption. To further enhance QoE, we propose the receiver-driven encoding rate adaptation strategy to increase the playback continuity and the deadline-driven sender buffer scheduling strategy to ensure that the segments arrive at the players within their response latency. Experimental results from PeerSim and PlanetLab show the effectiveness and efficiency of CloudFog and our individual strategies in increasing user coverage, reducing response latency and bandwidth consumption.					44th Annual International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops (ICPPW)44th Annual International Conference on Parallel Processing Workshops (ICPPW)	SEP 01-04, 2015SEP 01-04, 2015	IEEE Comp Soc; Int Conf Parallel Proc; Tsinghua Univ; Int Assoc Comp & Commun; Baidu; Tsinghua Natl Lab Informat Sci & TechnolIEEE Comp Soc; Int Conf Parallel Proc; Tsinghua Univ; Int Assoc Comp & Commun; Baidu; Tsinghua Natl Lab Informat Sci & Technol	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINABeijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	3	0	0	0	0	3			0190-3918		978-1-4673-7588-7	WOS:000379202700051

In current methods, when nodes meet, they simply communicate with their real IDs, which leads to privacy and security concerns. Anonymizing real IDs among encountering neighbor nodes solves such concerns. However, this prevents nodes from collecting real ID based encountering information, which is needed to support MOSN services. Therefore, in this paper, we propose FaceChange that can support both anonymizing real IDs among neighbor nodes and collecting real ID based encountering information. To realize neighbor node anonymity, two encountering nodes communicate anonymously. Then, when the two nodes disconnect, each node forwards an encrypted encountering evidence to the encountered node to enable encountering information collection. A set of novel schemes are designed to protect the confidentiality and uniqueness of encountering evidences. FaceChange also supports fine-grained control over what encountering information should be forwarded based on attribute similarity (i.e., trust) without disclosing attributes. Extensive analysis and experiments show the effectiveness of FaceChange on protecting node privacy and meanwhile supporting the encountering information collection in MOSNs. Real implementation on smartphones also demonstrates its energy efficiency.					23rd IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP23rd IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP	NOV 10-13, 2015NOV 10-13, 2015	IEEE; IEEE Comp SocIEEE; IEEE Comp Soc	San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0			1092-1648		978-1-4673-8295-3	WOS:000378856600017

However, OpenFlow only provides a simple "match-action" paradigm and lacks the function of stateful forwarding for SDN data plane, which limits it to support advanced network applications. Heavily relying on SDN controllers for all state maintenance incurs both scalability and performance issues. In this paper, we propose a novel Stateful Data Plane Architecture (SDPA) for SDN data plane. A co-processing unit, Forwarding Processor (FP), is designed for SDN switches to manage state information through new instructions and state tables. We design and implement an extended OpenFlow protocol to implement the communication between the controller and FP. To demonstrate the practicality and feasibility of our approach, we implement both software and hardware prototypes of SDPA switches, and develop a sample network function chain with stateful firewall, DNS reflection attack defense and NAT applications in one SDPA-based switch. Experimental results show that the SDPA architecture can effectively improve the forwarding efficiency with manageable processing overhead for those applications that need stateful forwarding in SDN-based networks.					23rd IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP23rd IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP	NOV 10-13, 2015NOV 10-13, 2015	IEEE; IEEE Comp SocIEEE; IEEE Comp Soc	San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0			1092-1648		978-1-4673-8295-3	WOS:000378856600030

Specifically, the effect of coupled inductors on the z-source breaker is studied. It is shown that the inductor weight can be reduced by 30% and the inductor volume can be reduced by about 25% when coupled inductors are used. Furthermore, the coupling plays a part in the commutation process meaning that the breaker can operate with one capacitor instead of two. These results mean that the major components of the z-source breaker can be greatly reduced. Simulations are carried out to verify the results.

Consumer wearables such as the Jawbone UP and Fitbit Flex empower people to change habits that may help prevent health problems. The success of wearables depends on their perceived ease of use and how successfully users are able to incorporate them into their lives over the long term. We conducted a usability test and field study with fourteen users comparing two consumer wearable devices. While participants rated the aesthetic design of the Jawbone UP24 higher, they rated app characteristics such as usefulness and trust in data generated of the Fitbit Flex app higher. These findings suggest that while wearable technologies are advancing in capabilities, their acceptance and satisfaction may depend on the quality of the app, in addition to the qualities of the wearable device itself.					9th International Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare (PervasiveHealth)9th International Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare (PervasiveHealth)	MAY 20-23, 2015MAY 20-23, 2015		Bogazici Univ, Istanbul, TURKEYBogazici Univ, Istanbul, TURKEY	0	0	0	0	0	0			2153-1633		978-1-6319-0045-7	WOS:000379199200038

Leveraging the conservation of mass law, we design a fault detection mechanism and checkpoint/restart fault tolerance approach to enhance the resilience of CLAMR. Overall, our approach can detect up to 88.3% of faults that propagate into SDC or crashes with minimal (less than 1%) overhead for the optimal configuration. We show that CLAMR's fault-tolerance depends on when a fault is injected into the simulation and we also evaluate the frequency of detection and checkpointing on performance.

In addition to regrowth control, rootstocks treated with fatty alcohol have been shown to increase in stored carbohydrates over time after treatment. This carbohydrate increase allows for a more successful, durable graft, and gives grafted transplants an advantage in field establishment. Because treated rootstocks increase in carbohydrates over time, older, treated rootstocks may contain enough stored energy to allow improved grafting success in a shorter period of time. This treatment also allows for a longer time period in which rootstock can be used in grafting. An overview of experiments will be presented to describe this novel approach to cucurbit grafting, including a rate trial to determine the optimal fatty alcohol treatment concentration, analyses of rootstock carbohydrate content over time after fatty alcohol treatment, grafting experiments to determine the effect of fatty alcohol treatment on rootstock grafting success as well as to determine the optimal grafting age after fatty alcohol treatment, and field trials to determine whether fatty alcohol treatments give grafted transplants an added advantage in the field.					1st International Symposium on Vegetable Grafting (ISVG)1st International Symposium on Vegetable Grafting (ISVG)	MAR 17-21, 2014MAR 17-21, 2014	Int Soc Hort SciInt Soc Hort Sci	Wuhan, PEOPLES R CHINAWuhan, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-94-62610-81-1	WOS:000378633700007

North Carolina (NC) and South Carolina (SC) produced about 5% of the USA acreage and value, yet the melon crop in these two states are still valued at several million dollars. Most melon production involves various types of orange flesh melons commonly marketed as cantaloupes. In addition to cantaloupes, there are other types of "specialty" melons that provide new production opportunities. Several of these melon types have relatively soft flesh and limited shelf life, and are less suited for shipping or the larger grocery store retail market. Grafting was evaluated in three tests in 2011 through 2013 in NC and SC to determine if there were any advantages with respect to yield (earliness and total production) and quality (fruit size, soluble solids, and flesh firmness). The were 7 melon entries evaluated in 2011, and 16 melon entries evaluated in 2012 and 2013 studies, which were replicated 5 or 3 times, respectively. Generally, yields were reduced with the various melon cultivars and types tested when using grafted rather than self-grafted or non-grafted plants indicating that the graft itself was not a detriment to yields. Grafted plants of most melon cultivars tended to yield more fruit numbers in earlier harvests than non-grafted plants. Flesh firmness was generally found to be inferior for fruits obtained from grafted plants. Soluble solid levels differed between cultivars, with 'Sprite' having some of the highest readings, but did not differ between grafted and non-grafted treatments. Fruit length and width were variably affected, with little response to grafting in the SC location, and reduced fruit lengths measured in the NC location.					1st International Symposium on Vegetable Grafting (ISVG)1st International Symposium on Vegetable Grafting (ISVG)	MAR 17-21, 2014MAR 17-21, 2014	Int Soc Hort SciInt Soc Hort Sci	Wuhan, PEOPLES R CHINAWuhan, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-94-62610-81-1	WOS:000378633700034

Peach is one of the best genetically characterized deciduous trees. Here, we provide a concise review of the salient features of the peach whole genome sequence and highlight specific aspects of its genome organization. A complete chromosome-scale assembly was obtained by Sanger whole genome shotgun methods. We predicted 27,852 protein-coding genes as well as non-coding RNAs. Analyses of the expansion of gene families related to sorbitol metabolism and to the phenylpropanoid network highlighted cornerstone features in the evolution of the Spiraeoideae subfamily and a Prunus-specific mode of genome evolution likely associated with unique production of the lignified stone in these species. Moreover, we investigated the path of peach domestication through whole genome resequencing of 14 Prunus accessions. The analyses suggest major genetic bottlenecks that have significantly shaped peach genome diversity. Furthermore, comparative analyses show that peach has not undergone a recent whole genome duplication (WGD) and even though the ancestral triplicated blocks in peach are fragmentary compared to those in grape, all seven paleosets of paralogues from the putative paleoancestor are detectable.					8th International Peach Symposium8th International Peach Symposium	JUN 17-20, 2013-2016JUN 17-20, 2013-2016	Int Soc Hort SciInt Soc Hort Sci	Matera, ITALYMatera, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-94-62610-79-8	WOS:000378619300006

A factorial experiment was initiated in 2010 at the Western Colorado Research Center, CO with soil solarization vs. no soil solarization as main treatments; chicken manure plus compost, chicken manure, mustard (Brassica juncea), mustard meal cake, and a control as sub-treatments and 'Nemaguard', 'Lovell', 'St. Julian' and 'Viking' rootstocks as sub-sub treatments with 6 replications. The tree growth on the above rootstocks was also compared with trench and compost as well as in non-replant site in different experiments. Trees were planted in May the following year of treatments and tree circumferences were measured within a month of planting, and tree survival taken annually. Results indicated that soil solarization had no impact on first year growth, second year, and cumulative growth. Soil amendments and rootstock had a significant effect on first year, second year and cumulative tree growth. 'Viking' was the best rootstock in terms of tree growth irrespective of treatments and for tree survival in some treatments. Tree mortality, observed in some treatment combinations such as in soil solarization combined with mustard, was not found in the mustard and chicken manure plots, nor with 'Nemaguard' rootstock except in the soil solarization combined with chicken manure plots. Tree growth on 'Nemaguard' rootstock was second to 'Viking'. The least tree growth and lowest tree mortality was observed on 'St. Julian' rootstock. Cytospora canker was associated with higher tree death after the first year. Trenching increased tree growth which varied with compost and rootstock combination.					8th International Peach Symposium8th International Peach Symposium	JUN 17-20, 2013-2016JUN 17-20, 2013-2016	Int Soc Hort SciInt Soc Hort Sci	Matera, ITALYMatera, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-94-62610-79-8	WOS:000378619300078

Xiloyannis, C; Inglese, P; Montanaro, G		Relationship between Fruit Maturity at Harvest and Fruit Quality in Peach								VIII INTERNATIONAL PEACH SYMPOSIUM		Acta Horticulturae		1084				643	648					2015	2015	Determining the right time for harvesting peaches is of utmost importance to everyone in the fruit growing and distribution chain: growers, distributors and consumers. Peach maturity at harvest affects fruit quality and consequently consumer preference in the market. Fruit size and red skin coloration are the most common indicators of fruit maturity used to decide when to harvest in everyday orchard operations. These attributes can vary from year to year and do not provide fully reliable assessment of maturity especially in newly released cultivars with extensive red skin color. Fruit firmness (FF), soluble solids concentration (SSC) and/or total acidity (TA) are better indicators of fruit maturity. However, their simple and rapid assessment does not provide all necessary information and requires fruit destruction. A new, nondestructive, fruit ripening device, the DA meter, determines fruit ripeness by measuring the chlorophyll (I-AD index) in fruit, where I-AD decrease during the maturation of fruits from 2.0 to a 0.1. This is a promising tool for both practical and scientific applications, since it allows one to monitor on-tree fruit ripening, to establish accurately the optimal harvest time, and to reduce the variability that is present in fruit batches. In this research the DA meter was evaluated over three seasons in 10 peach cultivars grown and marketed in South Carolina for its ability to determine fruit maturity and correlate maturity index to ripening related changes in fruit quality parameters. Data revealed that few cultivars were harvested at the correct maturity. FF was positively correlated with maturity index, while SSC and TA showed no difference between fruit of different maturities. SSC/TA ratio, however, was negatively correlated with the fruit maturity index suggesting better taste of more mature fruit, I-AD <= 0.6, which was valued most by consumers.					8th International Peach Symposium8th International Peach Symposium	JUN 17-20, 2013-2016JUN 17-20, 2013-2016	Int Soc Hort SciInt Soc Hort Sci	Matera, ITALYMatera, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-94-62610-79-8	WOS:000378619300086

Specifically, the possibility of using phosphorus (P) restriction as a tool to manage stem elongation was explored. Unrooted cuttings were propagated with or without a complete fertilizer delivered through the mist system. The rooted cuttings were then transplanted into a growing medium with or without an incorporated starter charge of a water soluble fertilizer. After transplant, plants were irrigated with fertilizer solutions containing normal levels of all the essential nutrients except phosphorus which was applied at the rate of 0, 3, 6 or 12 ppm. The lack of fertilization during propagation resulted in flowering being delayed by six days, but had no effect on total flower number. The lack of a starter charge in the growing media at transplant reduced final plant height and delayed flowering. Small differences in growth and flowering were observed when P fertigation was reduced from 12 to 6 ppm P. Differences were more prominent as P decreased from 6 to 3 ppm, while the largest effect on growth and flowering occurred when P was reduced from 3 to 0 ppm. These results suggest that P-restriction can be effective for reducing stem elongation, but this technique might be difficult to implement commercially because of the relatively narrow range of P concentrations at which the desired reduction in plant height can be achieved.					29th Int Horticultural Congress on Horticulture - Sustaining Lives, Livelihoods and Landscapes (IHC) / 17th Int Symposium on Horticultural Econ and Management / 5th Int Symposium on Improving the Performance of Supply Chains in the Transit Economies29th Int Horticultural Congress on Horticulture - Sustaining Lives, Livelihoods and Landscapes (IHC) / 17th Int Symposium on Horticultural Econ and Management / 5th Int Symposium on Improving the Performance of Supply Chains in the Transit Economies	AUG 17-22, 2014AUG 17-22, 2014	Int Soc Horticultural SciInt Soc Horticultural Sci	Brisbane, AUSTRALIABrisbane, AUSTRALIA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-94-62610-90-3	WOS:000378598000002

'Freedom Red') that occurs on the lateral stems that develop following the propagation and pinching of the cuttings removed from those stock plants. In the first experiment, stock plants were grown in greenhouses under ambient irradiance or 50% irradiance reduction shade cloth. Within each irradiance treatment, stock plants were placed at three different spacings, 410, 730, or 1140 cm(2) plant(-1). Flowering plants were dropped onto a concrete pad from different heights to quantify stem breakage. The stock plants grown under the 50% shade and 410 cm(2) plant(-1) spacing treatment produced cuttings that experienced 29% stem breakage when dropped 30 cm, while the stock plants grown under ambient irradiance and 1140 cm(2) spacing produced cuttings that had only 3% stem breakage. In a second experiment, stock plants were grown outdoors with 0, 62 or 81% shade. Stock plants grown under 81% shade produced cuttings that were significantly more susceptible to stem breakage, e.g., 35% stem breakage at 30 cm drop height, than cuttings harvested from stock plants grown under ambient irradiance, which experienced only 9% stem breakage. These data support the hypothesis that the irradiance delivered to the stock plants can impact stem breakage of the plants grown from the cuttings harvested from those stock plants.					29th Int Horticultural Congress on Horticulture - Sustaining Lives, Livelihoods and Landscapes (IHC) / 17th Int Symposium on Horticultural Econ and Management / 5th Int Symposium on Improving the Performance of Supply Chains in the Transit Economies29th Int Horticultural Congress on Horticulture - Sustaining Lives, Livelihoods and Landscapes (IHC) / 17th Int Symposium on Horticultural Econ and Management / 5th Int Symposium on Improving the Performance of Supply Chains in the Transit Economies	AUG 17-22, 2014AUG 17-22, 2014	Int Soc Horticultural SciInt Soc Horticultural Sci	Brisbane, AUSTRALIABrisbane, AUSTRALIA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-94-62610-90-3	WOS:000378598000021

Conventional propagation by seed or division fails to meet current demand. In contrast, micropropagation can present an opportunity for the mass production in large quantities in a short time. The major goal of this study was to select the best Black Mondo clone, having the ability to simultaneously give superior shooting and rooting, among 114 genotypes for micropropagation. A kind of in vitro selection method consisting of the repeated 4 multiplication and 3 rooting cycles was performed on the in vitro germinated seedlings. Multiplication cycles were carried out in a liquid system while the rooting procedures were executed in both solidified and liquid media to compare their efficiency. Meanwhile, the effect of higher concentrated sucrose on rooting ratio was examined. Our first selection criteria was to determine the genotypes, having a multiplication rate over 3 and rooting ratio more than 95%. Then the best three clones were selected among them. Accordingly, the multiplication rates of the best three Black Mondo clones were determined to be 4.12, 3.65 and 3.27, respectively, while all of their rooting ratio was 100%. The findings revealed that Ophiopogon planiscapus 'Nigrescens' can be successfully micropropagated and additionally, this kind of in vitro selection method could be used efficiently for selection of the best clones either in Black Mondo, or possibly in other plant species.					25th International EUCARPIA Symposium Section on Ornamentals - Crossing Borders25th International EUCARPIA Symposium Section on Ornamentals - Crossing Borders	JUN 28-JUL 02, 2015JUN 28-JUL 02, 2015	Int Soc Hort Sci; EUCARPIAInt Soc Hort Sci; EUCARPIA	Melle, BELGIUMMelle, BELGIUM	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-94-62610-78-1	WOS:000378634700057		
R			Clemson University						Citrus x paradisi Transcriptome or Gene expression								European Nucleotide Archive														2016-03-18	2015	Huanglongbing (HLB) is currently the most destructive disease of citrus worldwide. Although there is no immune cultivar, field tolerance to HLB within citrus and citrus relatives has been observed at the USDA Picos farm at Ft. Pierce, Florida, where plants are exposed to a very high level of HLB pressure. It is apparent that some citrus types are more tolerant to HLB. By profiling the transcriptome of HLB tolerant and HLB susceptible citrus trees, we could find out the candidate genes that have been suppressed or activated in HLB tolerant citrus tree, which lead to the promotion of the basal resistance or immunity of citrus trees. This study may help us understand HLB-tolerance and provide guidance for breeding HLB-tolerant citrus in the future.									0	0	0	0	0	0						DRCI:DATA2016181009578651

Therefore, monitoring tool condition from the initial to final stages of tool life is a task that is critical yet difficult, especially in hard-to-machine materials. In this work, Wavelet Packet Decomposition is used for extracting statistical features in the time-frequency domain of two low cost sensing technologies, i.e. vibration and power, in addition to Principal Component Analysis to reduce the dimensionality of feature vectors. A Recurrent Neural Network is then trained with Bayesian regularization backpropagation method and the estimated tool wear is compared to the actual measured wear. Results show a maximum of 13% relative error in estimating tool wear which proves the effectiveness of implemented sensory data fusion method to be used in automated control of manufacturing processes.

A lightweight, mobile acoustic sensor network has been used as an infrastructure to layer multi-sensor fusion algorithms, for detection of impulsive events such as gunfire or explosions. The system can create actionable information within seconds, and can be used to direct assets such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to specific coordinates, for eyes-on assessment in under a minute.The sensor array will be discussed in terms of its three primary components: the smart sensors, the synchronization network, and the fusion algorithms.

Configurations like hybrid or plug-in hybrid electric vehicle are becoming more accessible and popular due to their perception of efficiency and lower direct environmental impact. However the penetration rates of these advanced powertrain configurations remains still low, due to their higher cost compared to the well-established internal combustion engine. Therefore the relation between cost and benefit needs to be addressed early on in the powertrain design stage to find the right balance for the customer. This paper proposes a powertrain design optimization framework, demonstrated on the series hybrid electric vehicle configuration, where the customer benefit is represented by the decrease of the fuel consumption for a given duty cycle.The scope of this paper is to demonstrate this design methodology on the power pack, which acts as the principal energy source in the series hybrid electric vehicle (SHEV) configuration. A two stage optimization framework is developed to maximize the fuel economy within the power demand constraints coming from the drive cycle. The Genetic Algorithm is used in the first stage to generate a particular engine-generator configuration, using Willans line description for component sizing. The candidate configuration is then evaluated in the second stage by using Dynamic Programming to optimize the supervisory control and generate a fuel-economy benchmark over a given drive cycle. By using this two stage design optimization framework, the maximum fuel economy is found for the given drive cycle within the power demand constraints.					12th IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference (VPPC)12th IEEE Vehicle Power and Propulsion Conference (VPPC)	OCT 19-22, 2015OCT 19-22, 2015	IEEE; TM4; OPAL RT TechnolIEEE; TM4; OPAL RT Technol	Montreal, CANADAMontreal, CANADA	0	0	0	0	0	0			1938-8756		978-1-4673-7637-2	WOS:000377904400078

In stand-alone mode, microgrid is also capable of delivering power to customers due to the integration of renewable energy sources and energy storage. However, there are some potential problems with this benefit, such as, harmonic distortion. In order to analyze the harmonic distortion influence on a stand-alone microgrid, a case study was conducted. By building microgrid models in the Matlab/Simulink platform, harmonics can be monitored and assessed. To solve this power quality problem, an active power filter model is integrated to mitigate high frequency harmonics. Simulation results are compared through two proposed indices for power quality measurement: Total Harmonics Distortion (THD) and Whole System Harmonics Distortion Level (WSHDL).

The unique feature of the controller is that it uses a quadratic optimization based framework for utilizing the degree of freedom provided by right eigenvectors to selectively improve the damping of poorly located modes while trying to preserve the dominant open loop behaviour of the rest of the system. The input/output signal selection for the wide area controller is based on a controllability metric. An algorithm explaining the framework and its implementation has been tested on the IEEE 68 bus test system. The results show the ability of the controller to utilize a few suitable inputs and outputs to improve the damping of selected eigenvalues with minimal impact on other eigenvalues.

IEEE					Operation of MOV-protected Series Compensator with Wind Power during Faults								2015 NORTH AMERICAN POWER SYMPOSIUM (NAPS)		North American Power Symposium												2015	2015	Metal oxide varistor (MOV) is an electrical device that is connected in parallel with a transmission line series compensator to protect it against overvoltage during faults. The nonlinearity of this device adds complexity to the evaluation of system performance especially during unsymmetrical faults. The variability of wind energy introduces additional complexity to the analysis of the power system performance during faults. This paper studies the impact of the intermittent wind power generation on the operation of MOV during faults. For the purpose of simulation, an equivalent wind farm model is proposed to generate a wind generation profile using wind farm generation from California independent system operator (ISO) as a guide for wind power variation to perform the study. The IEEE 12-bus test system is modified to include MOV-protected series capacitor and the equivalent wind farm model. The modified test system is simulated in the MATLAB/ Simulink environment. The study has been achieved on the modified test system considering three phase and single line to ground (SLG) faults near the terminal of the series compensated line to show the effect of wind variation on the MOV operation.

The system is modeled to include wind generation dynamics. The wind generator used is the doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG). An algorithm is achieved in the MATLAB environment. The algorithm has two parts: the power system analysis toolbox (PSAT) main algorithm and the other part is proposed to handle the calculation of TSA coefficients. These coefficients are calculated each time step of the dynamic simulation to get the full trajectory. The whole algorithm is time-synchronized and is tested on the IEEE 68-bus system to show the impact of wind generation on the system state variables and hence the security assessment. The simulation results show that the algorithm can be used to find the most sensitive state variables to the DFIG changed parameter.

The use of mobile technology to improve patient flow and quality of care could be facilitated if such voice recognition technology could be made robust. The goal of this experiment was to allow the Periop staff to provide care without being interrupted with data entry and querying tasks. However, the results are generalizable to other situations where an engineering manager attempts to improve communication performance using mobile technology. This study enhanced Google's voice recognition capability by using post-processing classifiers (i.e., bag-of-sentences, support vector machine, and maximum entropy). The experiments investigated three factors (original phrasing, reduced phrasing, and personalized phrasing) at three levels (zero training repetition, 5 training repetitions, and 10 training repetitions). Results indicated that personal phrasing yielded the highest correctness and that training the device to recognize an individual's voice improved correctness as well. Although simplistic, the bag-of-sentences classifier significantly improved voice recognition correctness. The classification efficiency of the maximum entropy and support vector machine algorithms was found to be nearly identical. These results suggest that engineering managers could significantly enhance Google's voice recognition technology by using post-processing techniques, which would facilitate its use in health care and other applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1042-9247	2377-0643		WOS:000377542100007

Estimating the level of risk that an invasive alien species poses to native species across landscapes is important for prioritizing mitigation efforts. We describe a risk assessment approach that incorporates spatial heterogeneity in effects and illustrate this method by considering the risk that the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) presents to two native birds. The common ground-dove (Columbina passerina), an oviparous, ground-nesting species with altricial young that prefers open habitats, is more susceptible to impacts from fire ants than the swallow-tailed kite (Elanoides forficatus), which occupies closed-canopy forests, nests high in trees, is oviparous and has altricial young. Risk approaches that consider landscapes and that are spatially explicit are of particular relevance as remaining undeveloped lands become in creasingly uncommon, disjointed and more important for the management and recovery of native species and ecosystems.									0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-78064-394-6	WOS:000377029800012

Drawing on data from a large national survey study of college students about their high school science experiences, we compare how frequently sustainability topics (e.g. energy supply, energy demand, climate change, water supply) are covered in high school physics versus other science courses. Furthermore, employing science agency and physics identity theoretical perspectives, we examine whether the inclusion of sustainability topics has an effect on student science agency beliefs or their physics identities while controlling for demographics and other background variables. Our results indicate that physics courses are reported to cover sustainability topics less frequently than other science courses. In addition, the inclusion of certain topics (e.g. energy supply) has significant effect on student science agency beliefs and physics identity.

However, it can be challenging to construct assessments measuring students' understanding of concepts and elicit deeper levels of cognition during problem solving. Tests are common assessments, but students assume test questions will have a numeric or symbolic answer. This study analyzes test responses and reflections on a question without a numeric or symbolic answer from a calculus-based physics class. Though designed to test conceptual understanding, students' assumptions and expectations about test questions hindered their ability to accurately represent their understanding. We analyzed students' responses and short reflections on the problem by looking at ways students tried to solve the problem and their uncertainties when confronted by a non-traditional test question. Using a framework of epistemic resources, we found that students used a variety of resources to pursue a solution; though common patterns emerge that can inform instructors and physics education researchers.

We rely on a tetrahedral mesh of the rest configuration particles and use a simple, table-lookup approach to produce triangulated fracture geometry for each rest configuration tetrahedron based on its configuration of broken edges. Subsequently, these triangle vertices are transformed with a per particle transformation to obtain a fracture surface in world space that has minimal deformation and also preserves temporal coherence. The results show that our approach is effective at producing realistic fractures, and capable of extracting fracture surfaces from the complex simulation.					11th International Symposium on Visual Computing (ISVC)11th International Symposium on Visual Computing (ISVC)	DEC 14-16, 2015DEC 14-16, 2015	UNR; Desert Res Inst; LBNL; NASA Ames; BAE Syst; Intel; Ford; Hewlett Packard; Mitsubishi Elec Res Labs; Toyota; Gen Elect; Berkeley LabUNR; Desert Res Inst; LBNL; NASA Ames; BAE Syst; Intel; Ford; Hewlett Packard; Mitsubishi Elec Res Labs; Toyota; Gen Elect; Berkeley Lab	Las Vegas, NVLas Vegas, NV	0	0	0	0	0	0			0302-9743		978-3-319-27857-5; 978-3-319-27856-8	WOS:000376400300008

Cyberbullying Via Social Media								JOURNAL OF SCHOOL VIOLENCE				14	1	SI		11	29		10.1080/15388220.2014.949377			2015	2015	Recent years have witnessed a surge of research on cyberbullying. In this article, three studies examined prevalence rates of cyberbullying among college-age students, venues through which cyberbullying occurs, with a particular focus on social media, and perceptions of cyberbullying as a function of features of the target (e.g., peer, celebrity, groups). Study 1 found texting and social media to be the most commonly used venues for cyberbullying victimization. Study 2 determined that features of the target of cyber aggressive comments influenced perceptions of cyberbullying. Online aggressive comments directed toward peers were perceived most negatively whereas those targeted toward random people known only online were evaluated least negatively. Using an innovative methodology for examining cyberbullying, Study 3 found that venue (e.g., Facebook, comments, forum posts) and features of the target influenced the nature of online exchanges. Implications for prevention and intervention are discussed.									11	0	0	1	0	11			1538-8220	1538-8239		WOS:000375791100002

For the first time, the effects of the ZnO buffer layers doped with different metal materials on the structural and the optical properties of the ZnO thin films are investigated. The surface morphologies of the ZnO thin films having wrinkle structures significantly depended on the type of buffer layer. The largest crystallite size and the highest c-axis orientation were observed for the ZnO thin film with a Co-doped ZnO buffer layer. However, the transmittance for the ZnO thin films with metal-doped buffer layers was slightly decreased compared to that without the buffer layer, and metal-doped ZnO buffer layers hardly affected the optical band gap of the ZnO thin films.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0374-4884	1976-8524		WOS:000349661100015

This paper proposes a multilevel algorithmic framework that scales efficiently to very large data sets. Instead of solving the whole training set in one optimization process, the support vectors are obtained and gradually refined at multiple levels of coarseness of the data. Our multilevel framework substantially improves the computational time without loosing the quality of classifiers. The algorithms are demonstrated for both regular and weighted support vector machines for balanced and imbalanced classification problems. Quality improvement on several imbalanced data sets has been observed.					15th Annual International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS)15th Annual International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS)	JUN 01-03, 2015JUN 01-03, 2015	Elsevier; Univ Amsterdam; NTU Singapore; Univ TennesseeElsevier; Univ Amsterdam; NTU Singapore; Univ Tennessee	Reykjavik Univ, Reykjavik, ICELANDReykjavik Univ, Reykjavik, ICELAND	1	0	0	1	0	1			1877-0509		*****************	WOS:000373939100275		
J	Elraghy, Omaima; Baldwin, William S.								Repression of multiple CYP2D genes in mouse primary hepatocytes with a single siRNA construct								IN VITRO CELLULAR & DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY-ANIMAL				51	1			9	14		10.1007/s11626-014-9803-9			JAN 2015	2015	The Cyp2d subfamily is the second most abun-dant subfamily of hepatic drug-metabolizing CYPs. In mice, there are nine Cyp2d members that are believed to have redundant catalytic activity. We are testing and optimizing the ability of one short interfering RNA (siRNA) construct to knockdown the expression of multiple mouse Cyp2ds in primary hepatocytes. Expression of Cyp2d10, Cyp2d11, Cyp2d22, and Cyp2d26 was observed in the primary male mouse hepatocytes. Cyp2d9, which is male-specific and growth hormone-dependent, was not expressed in male primary hepatocytes, potentially because of its dependence on pulsatile growth hormone release from the anterior pituitary. Several different siRNAs at different concentrations and with different reagents were used to knockdown Cyp2d expression. siRNA constructs designed to repress only one construct often mildly repressed several Cyp2d isoforms. A construct designed to knockdown every Cyp2d isoform provided the best results, especially when incubated with transfection reagents designed specifically for primary cell culture. Interestingly, a construct designed to knockdown all Cyp2d isoforms, except Cyp2d10, caused a 2.5x increase in Cyp2d10 expression, presumably because of a compensatory response. However, while RNA expression is repressed 24 h after siRNA treatment, associated changes in Cyp2d-mediated metabolism are tenuous. Overall, this study provides data on the expression of murine Cyp2ds in primary cell lines, valuable information on designing siRNAs for silencing multiple murine CYPs, and potential pros and cons of using siRNA as a tool for repressing Cyp2d and estimating Cyp2d's role in murine xenobiotic metabolism.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1071-2690	1543-706X		WOS:000348989700002	25124873

With their ease in evaluating the expected probability of a target destroyed, they serve as a valuable tool in military predictive analyses and decision making processes. The symmetric nature of the damage function, however, limits its application toward a wide number of military scenarios where destruction levels extend beyond one dimension. To account for asymmetric damage, Paul Goethals, Greg Boylan, and Rae Cho propose a variant of the traditional function, and demonstrate its effectiveness using a simulation-based approach.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0275-5823			WOS:000373646900003

It focuses on understanding of illness from an intersubjective perspective, involving a dialogue between physician and patient, and a shared understanding of the patient's narrative. The principles embodied in RCC have not been well described with respect to psychotherapeutic care with children and adolescents and their families, or in residential treatment settings, which may be hierarchical in their approaches.Methods: This paper will demonstrate how employing multiple treatment modalities including (1) patient/family, (2) shared decision making (3) emotional connections and (4) community partnerships, in using the Relationship Centered Care (RCC) approach can lead to the promotion of well-being and resilience. The case of a pre-adolescent boy with multiple mental health and behavioral issues will be used to illustrate this approach.Results: The case demonstrates the effective utilization of the relationship-centered approach in comprehensively addressing the complex needs of a child with mental health and behavioral challenges.Conclusions: The RCC approach helps bridge the coordination of multi-system plan of treatment intervention for a pre-adolescent youth in a children's residential program yielding an optimal outcome for both the child and family.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2210-6766	2210-6774		WOS:000372468000005

Data are widely available, but the challenge, as with developed countries, is figuring out how best to use it. A case study method was used to consider approaches in Nairobi, Kenya; Istanbul, Turkey; and Dhaka, Bangladesh. In Nairobi, GPS location data were collected to generate the first map of the complex Matatu transit network. In Istanbul, automated fare collection systems were processed to understand better the usage of a bus rapid transit system. In Dhaka, researchers were collecting GPS positioning data to manage the city bus networks. Residents of these developing cities were frequent users of online media, as in many cities in the developing countries. This study revealed that integration of online media with location-based data provided a big data scenario that had the potential for supporting transit operations while posing challenges to the management of data mobility. It is not realistic to apply a one-size fits-all approach to any problem in the developing world, but together the case studies show that with the right approach, technical capacity in transitional cities has the potential to grow to support higher-level data processing and make more efficient and more sustainable policy decisions for crucial urban transit networks in developing countries.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0361-1981	2169-4052		WOS:000372389200006

The Rapid Autonomous Fuel Transfer (RAFT) project has demonstrated a methodology that could be used on the open water to autonomously refuel Navy vessels at significant sea states. The prototype refueling system is made up of two robotic arms: a rigid and precise industrial robotic manipulator to pinpoint the location of the target fuel tank and a novel soft pneumatic arm (Octarm) to provide compliant and safe contact with the USV. At the end of the Octarm, a magnetic end effector was designed (patent pending) to transfer a refueling "puck" from the robotic system to the target fuel tank. Acting under manual control or autonomously through visual tracking techniques, the robotic refueling system was shown to effectively transfer fuel to the target US Navy Sea Fox vessel under sea state 3.25 conditions at the US Army Aberdeen Test Center. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using a robotic solution to allow autonomous shore-to-ship or ship-to-USV refueling. It also illustrates the benefits and challenges of future robotic ship-to-USV refueling operations.

IEEE					Adaptive-Critic-Based Control of a Synchronous Generator in a Power System Using Biologically Inspired Artificial Neural Networks								2015 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS (IJCNN)		IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)												2015	2015	This paper proposes an adaptive critic design(A CD) based control method of a generator in a single machine infinite bus (SMm) power system, by using a biologically-inspired artificial neural network (BIANN). A heuristic dynamic programming (HDP) based optimal controller applying three BIANNs is designed for the control of the turbo generator in the SMm system. By developing a numerical derivative calculation algorithm, the difficulties in back-propagating errors through a BIANN are overcome. The HDP-BIANN controller for the turbo generator in the SMm system is trained and run online for different operating conditions. The results show that the HDP-BIANN controller improves the system damping as well as dynamic transient stability more effectively than the conventional controllers (CONVC) for not only small step changes, but also large disturbances such as a three phase short circuit. This is the first time that a BIANN is used for closed-loop optimal control of a power system.

IEEE					The Institutional Environment for Student Veterans in Engineering								FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION CONFERENCE (FIE), 2015		Frontiers in Education Conference						1800	1804					2015	2015	Active military and student veterans navigate engineering education in ways both similar to and different from their civilian counterparts. This Work in Progress describes variation in institutional environments through interviews with campus administrators and inspection of university websites at four institutions. Three emerging themes are identified: 1) the presence/absence of key student policies, 2) variation in student support services, and 3) gaps in provision of such services. Interviews provide data on the challenges faced and assets brought by veterans, from the point of view of administrators. We find that serving veterans is an area of recent and increasing importance to these institutions and that the level of services offered is evolving to include veterans resource centers, training for students and faculty on veterans' issues, and web portals to access veteran-specific information.					45th Annual Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)45th Annual Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)	OCT 21-24, 2015OCT 21-24, 2015	IEEE Educ Soc; IEEE Comp Soc; ASEE Educ Res & Methods Div; New Mexico State Univ; Univ Texas El Paso; Hewlett Packard; VentureWell; Markkula Ctr Appl Eth; IEEEIEEE Educ Soc; IEEE Comp Soc; ASEE Educ Res & Methods Div; New Mexico State Univ; Univ Texas El Paso; Hewlett Packard; VentureWell; Markkula Ctr Appl Eth; IEEE	El Paso, TXEl Paso, TX	0	0	0	0	0	0			0190-5848		978-1-4799-8454-1	WOS:000371705200303

Survey of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum in the United States								JOURNAL OF COTTON SCIENCE				19	2			328	336					2015	2015	Fusarium wilt is an important and widespread disease of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L. and Gossypium barbadense L.) caused by several races and genotypes of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum W.C. Snyder & H.N. Hans (FOV). A two-year survey (2012-2013) was conducted to assess the distribution of the fungus, and in particular FOV race 4, throughout the United States (U.S.) Cotton Belt. Partial sequences of the translation elongation factor (EF-1 alpha) region of FOV cultured from symptomatic cotton plants were compared to a database of sequences of known genotypes. Five nominal races of FOV, races 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8, and four previously recognized southeastern genotypes, LA108, LA110, LA112, and LA127/140, were identified. Representative isolates of each were pathogenic on cotton in greenhouse assays. A unique genotype of FOV, MDS-12, which was characterized with additional sequencing of the phosphate permease-like protein, beta-tubulin, and intergenic spacer regions, was identified in Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Georgia. FOV race 4 was not detected outside of California.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1523-6919	1524-3303		WOS:000372004500010

Each of the four nodes in the network has a half-duplex packet radio, and the nodes are connected by radio links that have time-varying fading. We present two methods for network-coded broadcast distribution. One method uses fountain coding and the other employs random linear network coding. Packet-by-packet adaptations of modulation and channel coding are employed to mitigate the effects of fading on the links. Our network-coded distribution methods are able to exploit the broadcast nature of the wireless medium for improved throughput, and they require only a single frequency band that is used for all packet transmissions in the network.					34th IEEE Annual Military Communications Conference (MILCOM) on Leveraging Technology - The Joint Imperative34th IEEE Annual Military Communications Conference (MILCOM) on Leveraging Technology - The Joint Imperative	OCT 26-28, 2015OCT 26-28, 2015	IEEEIEEE	Tampa, FLTampa, FL	1	0	0	0	0	1			2155-7578		978-1-5090-0073-9	WOS:000371395200192

Uncertainty is quantified with probability distribution and confidence levels are used to establish likelihood of forecast error. The optimization problem is formulated as a quadratic programming problem and the optimality of the solution is shown mathematically by proving the convexity of the problem. The optimization is carried out with the combined objective of minimizing total operating cost and carbon emission. The proposed optimization method is then tested against a priority controller for an extended time-horizon of 24 hours. Furthermore, under islanded mode of operation, for extended time-horizon, a key decision making task of whether to provide energy to non-critical loads or to store excess energy is addressed.

To satisfy this demand, power utilities have begun to construct an increasing number of wind generation facilities. Many of facilities are located in areas that require long distance underground cables connections to the grid. Maintaining these cables requires techniques to identify and locate potential problems such as water tree. However, many traditional detection techniques are not designed for long cables; therefore, new method must be developed to remotely and non-destructively locate and measure water tree development in long underground cables. By using a combination of high frequency pulse and pattern recognition, the new method can establish a system of benchmark frequencies corresponding to specific water tree capacitance values for a given piece cable. The new method works best for long cables and small water tree capacitances. It supplements tradition water tree detection techniques, such as travelling wave and partial discharge.

IEEE					Investigating Effects of Changes in Power Market Regulations on Demand-Side Resources Aggregators								2015 IEEE POWER & ENERGY SOCIETY GENERAL MEETING		IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting PESGM												2015	2015	A significant role of power market regulator is increasing market efficiency by considering constraints of power system. Thus, a power market regulator implements several regulations to achieve this target. However, the changes in regulations may have undesirable effects on some emerging market players. In this study, effects of changes in spinning reserve market regulations on behavior of demand-side resources aggregators such as responsive loads aggregator and plug-in electric vehicles aggregator are investigated. In this study, a hybrid method based on multi-agents and dynamic game theory considering supply function equilibrium model for bidding strategy is proposed to simulate behavior of the market players from regulator's point of view. The results demonstrate that smart aggregators can convert threats to opportunities and enhance their own profit, their customers' income and even the market efficiency.

IEEE					Out-of-step Detection Using Zubov's Approximation Stability Boundaries								2015 IEEE POWER & ENERGY SOCIETY GENERAL MEETING		IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting PESGM												2015	2015	This paper presents a new out-of-step detection method for multi-machine power systems based on approximate stability boundaries. The boundaries are constructed based on Zubov's method of stability analysis. The proposed out-of-step detection method first constructs a series of boundaries in power angle - frequency (delta-omega) plane, and tracks the trajectory of each generator in the delta-omega plane after the disturbance to differentiate out-of-step from stable power swings. The electrical parameters needed to construct approximate stability boundaries are obtained directly from Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) located at the generator's terminal. The effectiveness of the proposed method is tested in a Single Machine Infinite Bus (SMIB) and the IEEE 3-machine 9-bus system. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is capable of detecting out-of-step conditions in multi-machine power systems without using network reduction techniques.

This paper investigates the effects of customer demands on the DG planning. An optimization model based on dependent chance programming is firstly proposed. Two indices, voltage profile and reliability performance of customers, are defined as the objectives. Subsequently, scenarios defined according to the historical meteorological data are developed to simulate the uncertainty involved in DG output. A stochastic simulation based on defined scenarios is used to evaluate the satisfaction of customer expectation. Finally, simulations on a test system illustrate the dependence of the satisfaction on factors related to DG, such as location, type and scale.

J	Zhang, Yujie; Poursaee, Amir								Study of the semi-conductive behavior of the passive film on carbon steel in simulated concrete pore solution under stress								ANTI-CORROSION METHODS AND MATERIALS				62	6			363	370		10.1108/ACMM-04-2014-1375			2015	2015	Purpose - This paper aims to clarify the semi-conductive behavior of the passive layer formed in concrete environment without and with presence of chloride ions under different loading conditions. Passivation and depassivation of steel play an essential role in the subsequent stages of the corrosion process. Due to the nature of passive films on metals, they show electrochemical properties of a semi-conductor.Design/methodology/approach - A C-ring model was proposed in this experiment to induce stress on the specimens. Specimens under different levels of compressive and tensile loadings were exposed to chloride-free and chloride-contaminated solutions and their semi-conductive behavior was investigated using Mott-Schottky technique.Findings - Irrespective of the type and magnitude of the applied load, the passive film on rebars in simulated concrete pore solution is a highly disordered n-type semi-conductor. In all specimens, the presence of chloride ions decreases the slope of the Mott-Schottky plots, the donor density and the space charge layer thickness, which leads to a thinner passive film. Results indicate that steel specimens immersed in chloride-free pore solution under tensile loadings passivate more rapidly compared to those under compressive loadings. However, the situation in chloride-contaminated solution is different, and steel under tensile stress exhibits more corrosion than steel under compressive stress or under no load.Originality/value - Reinforced concrete structures inevitably experience variable mechanical loads, and continuous degradation from aggressive environments. Therefore, it is imperative to study the synergic impact of different types of mechanical loadings and exposure to chloride ions on this process. This paper fulfils this need.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0003-5599	1758-4221		WOS:000368329700002

DQ's produce higher accuracy than homogeneous transformation matrices (HTM) when transformed to modal shape functions (MSF) of similar order and are numerically stable. Thus, the model is compact, more accurate and computationally efficient than the modal kinematics proposed by the author based on HTM's. Also, DQ kinematics does not suffer from singularity related limitations of Euler angle based inverse orientation kinematics. Recursive schemes for deriving DQ's and DQ Jacobians are also presented and can be extended arbitrarily. Both modal HTM and modal DQ kinematics are then applied to solve illustrative spatial inverse position and orientation tracking problems. Based on the results, this paper quantitatively compares both methods and highlights the advantages of modal DQ kinematics. The proposed DQ kinematics are easily extensible to variable length multisection continuum arm with general actuator configurations.

Such robots are well suited for navigation through unstructured environments with superior reach using their flexible and thin profile, especially for inspection applications. This cable-like continuum robot design [1] has a concentric backbone arrangement but is spring-loaded and tendon-actuated, has improved compliance with a light and compact motor-encoder actuation mechanism. To account for the spring-loading, a compression factor is introduced on top of the established constant curvature continuum kinematics. The resulting continuum or shape variables are then estimated as a function of the measurable encoder variables. The effectiveness of the model is validated by performing experiments with the robot prototype.

However, it is unclear how the amount of correspondence between a virtual interaction metaphor to the real-world equivalent, otherwise known as dimensional symmetry, affects bimanual pscyhomotor skills training and how skills learned in the virtual simulation transfer to the real world. How does the number of degrees of freedom enhance or hinder the learning process? Does the increase in dimensional symmetry affect cognitive load? In an empirical evaluation, we compare the effectiveness of a natural 6-DOF interaction metaphor to a simplified 3-DOF metaphor. Our simulation interactively educates users in the step-by-step process of taking a precise measurement using calipers and micrometers in a simulated technical workbench environment. We conducted a usability study to evaluate the user experience and pedagogical benefits using measures including a pre and post cognition questionnaire over all levels of Bloom's taxonomy, workload assessment, system usability, and real world psychomotor assessment tasks. Results from the pre and post cognition questionnaires suggest that learning outcomes improved throughout all levels of Bloom's taxonomy for both conditions, and trends in the data suggest that the 6-DOF metaphor was more effective in real-world skill transference compared to the 3-DOF metaphor.					22nd IEEE Virtual Reality Conference (VR)22nd IEEE Virtual Reality Conference (VR)	MAR 23-27, 2015MAR 23-27, 2015	IEEE; IEEE Comp Soc; IEEE Comp Soc Visualizat & Graph Tech Comm; IEEE FranceIEEE; IEEE Comp Soc; IEEE Comp Soc Visualizat & Graph Tech Comm; IEEE France	Arles, FRANCEArles, FRANCE	0	0	0	0	0	0			1087-8270		978-1-4799-1727-3	WOS:000371409700001

We empirically evaluated the effects of realistic vs. non-realistic rendering of virtual humans on the emotional response of participants in a medical virtual reality system that was designed to educate users to recognize the signs and symptoms of patient deterioration. In a between-subjects experiment protocol, participants interacted with one of three different appearances of a virtual patient, namely realistic, non-realistic cartoon-shaded and charcoal-sketch like conditions. Emotional impact of the rendering conditions was measured via a combination of subjective and objective metrics.					22nd IEEE Virtual Reality Conference (VR)22nd IEEE Virtual Reality Conference (VR)	MAR 23-27, 2015MAR 23-27, 2015	IEEE; IEEE Comp Soc; IEEE Comp Soc Visualizat & Graph Tech Comm; IEEE FranceIEEE; IEEE Comp Soc; IEEE Comp Soc Visualizat & Graph Tech Comm; IEEE France	Arles, FRANCEArles, FRANCE	0	0	0	0	0	0			1087-8270		978-1-4799-1727-3	WOS:000371409700029

For this purpose, the rms and average current flowing through power switches and diodes in both high-frequency and low-frequency cells of DFCM converter are analytically calculated in detail in terms of the load peak current, load power factor and modulation index. Afterwards, an approach to obtain the parameters of the power switches and diodes from the datasheet and use them for calculation of conduction power losses is discussed. Finally, as an example, a 14MVA 3.3kV three-phase 9-level (line-to-line) DFCM converter is simulated and the obtained simulation results of the rms and average current flowing through the power switches and diodes matched with numerical results of the derived equations which validates the derived equations.

Flying capacitor multicell (FCM) converter is one of the well-known categories of multilevel power converters. Since conduction power loss investigation can be very advantageous in the design step of multilevel converters, this paper presents an analytic approach in order to calculate and investigate the conduction power loss in FCM converters. First, the rms and average currents of the insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) and anti-parallel diodes are analytically calculated by considering the associated duty cycle of each IGBT and anti-parallel diode, power converter modulation index, load current, and load power factor. Numerical results of the obtained analytical equations to calculate the rms and average currents of the IGBTs/diodes are compared against the simulation results whereas matching well and confirming accuracy of the derived formula. Afterwards, the obtained equations for the rms and average currents computation are used to calculate conduction power losses in a 12.25MVA 3.3kV 9-level (line-to-line) FCM power converter. A 2.5kV 1.5kA IGBT module from ABB is considered as power switches for FCM converter in performed case study.					30th Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition (APEC)30th Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition (APEC)	MAR 15-19, 2015MAR 15-19, 2015	IEEE; Power Sources Manufacturers Assoc; IEEE Power Elect Soc; IEEE Ind Applicat SocIEEE; Power Sources Manufacturers Assoc; IEEE Power Elect Soc; IEEE Ind Applicat Soc	Charlotte, NCCharlotte, NC	1	0	0	0	0	1			1048-2334		978-1-4799-6735-3	WOS:000370076902077

The proposed hybrid power converter is realized by the cascade connection of one DFCM power converter and one full-bridge converter (FBC) comprising floating-capacitor. Floating-capacitor voltage of the FBC is regulated naturally at its required voltage level owing to presence of redundant charging/discharging states provided by the proposed switching and modulation pattern for the suggested hybrid converter. So, the proposed control technique not only preserves natural balancing for FC voltages of DFCM converter but also provides natural balancing for floating-capacitor voltage of the FBC. The proposed hybrid DFCM power converter is simulated to inject/absorb active/reactive-power harvested from renewable energy resources into/from power grid. The presented simulation results for suggested hybrid DFCM power converter validate its viability, advantages, effectiveness, and the proposed modulation and control strategy.					30th Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition (APEC)30th Annual IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition (APEC)	MAR 15-19, 2015MAR 15-19, 2015	IEEE; Power Sources Manufacturers Assoc; IEEE Power Elect Soc; IEEE Ind Applicat SocIEEE; Power Sources Manufacturers Assoc; IEEE Power Elect Soc; IEEE Ind Applicat Soc	Charlotte, NCCharlotte, NC	0	0	0	0	0	0			1048-2334		978-1-4799-6735-3	WOS:000370076902078

The selected low-order harmonics is detected and calculated by a multiple reference frame harmonics estimator. The control methods of how to regulate the harmonics are developed for both the grid-side converter (GSC) and the rotor-side converter (RSC) of the back to back converter attached to the DFIG. The harmonics regulator control for GSC and RSC are parallel with the main decoupled control of the back to back converter operating the DFIG wind turbine system to generate electrical power to grid.

Although past research has found that psychological contract breach is positively associated with employee exit, voice and neglect and negatively associated with loyalty, we know little about the role that cultural values play in this process. We explore the role that power distance orientation-an employee's acceptance of power differentials in society-plays in employee responses to breach. We argue that employees with high power distance orientations will be more likely to respond passively to breach (loyalty and neglect), whereas employees with low power distance orientations will be more likely to exhibit active responses to psychological contract breach (exit and voice). We tested our notions using a sample of 265 employees from different cultures across two points in time. Employees with high power distance orientations were less likely to respond to psychological contract breach with exit and voice than employees with low power distance orientations. However, power distance orientation did not significantly moderate the relationships between psychological contract breach and neglect or loyalty, respectively. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of our findings.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-432X	1464-0643		WOS:000371307600005

These works on fatwas, though deeply insightful, are characterized by a text-centric approach. The text of the fatwa is seen as standing in a virtually sanitized environment free from the complexities of form, process, context and language. Challenging this bias in scholarship on fatwas, I argue for a broadening of the traditional text-centered approach to fatwa analysis by highlighting the importance of examining the fatwa issuance process as well as the broader context of fatwas that is jointly constructed and negotiated during the fatwa issuance process by the jurisconsult (mufti) and the questioner (mustafti). I substantiate my arguments by drawing on theories of language, interview methodology and writings on context and embodiment. To elucidate the significance of my propositions and recommendations, I supplement my discussions with examples from the field, including my own ethnographic work. As this article asserts, the merits of this approach to fatwa analysis include a drastic widening of the scope in which a particular fatwa can be understood and interpreted.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1743-0615	1743-0623		WOS:000371344900007

They believe that hands-on experimentation provides a unique opportunity for students to gain a deeper understanding of chemistry, as well as enabling authentic assessment of their chemistry knowledge. Students' attitudes, interests, and perceptions are all influenced by their laboratory experiences. Skills to be gained, concepts to be mastered, and understanding the nature of the scientific enterprise are often cited as some of the major objectives of the laboratory's role. Many different approaches have been proposed, implemented, and evaluated for students of all ages. This paper will explore some of the changes in laboratory instruction that have occurred during the last half-century, including research on the intent and effectiveness of the transition from verification activities to student-designed, inquiry-driven experiments. Misunderstandings about the design and role of the modern teaching laboratory curricula are also addressed.

However, most advances are also accompanied by associated retreats that must be managed. For example, tools for enabling students to visualize microscopic phenomena are incredibly good, and are constantly improving. The down side is that students receive great explanations for phenomena they are not likely to ever experience. Another example: Applying research findings from the cognitive sciences offers the promise of designing an optimal instructional protocol for every student. However, the relentless pressure to deliver instruction to more students for less money may make this level of individualization impossible. And yet another: The increasing availability of curricula for online instruction provides access to instruction that would otherwise be unavailable for many students. On the other hand, students in online courses do not benefit from the one-on-one guidance and counseling of real chemistry teachers, which may be essential for really learning a subject. Capitalizing on the positives while minimizing the effect of the negatives is indeed a daunting, but exciting, challenge for the next generation of chemistry educators.

By means of homogenization technique, we upscale the pore-scale Poisson-Nernst-Planck equation to the macroscopic scale and formulate a phase diagram in the (Da, Pe)-space that identifies the applicability conditions under which isothermal electrochemical macroscopic models provide an accurate description of the micro-scale dynamics [1]. In this work, we focus on the effect of temperature on macroscale (Newman-type) models' accuracy for a number of commercially available lithium-ion batteries. We show that macroscopic models are able to accurately represent pore-scale dynamics only within specific temperature bounds and their veracity is strongly controlled by the battery operating temperature conditions.

First only electronic resistance is considered and in the next step the effect of polarization resistance is also included. By considering constant model parameters for the lithium-ion battery analytical solutions exists for both scenarios using Pontryagins minimum principle. In lead-acid chemistry the variation of total internal resistance with state of charge (SOC) is considerable and the optimal charging problem results in a set of two nonlinear differential equations with one initial and a final condition to be satisfied. This so called two point boundary value problem is solved numerically.

Inspired by this social interaction, we propose to analyze human-agent mutual trust in the collaboration of human and (semi) autonomous multi-agent systems. Human-agent mutual trust should be bidirectional and determines the human's acceptance and use of autonomous agents as well as agents' willingness to take human's command. It is especially important when a human collaborates with multiple agents concurrently. In this paper, we propose time-series humanagent mutual trust models based on well known results from human factors engineering. To avoid both "over-trust" and "under-trust", we set up dynamic timing models for the multi-agent scheduling problem and develop necessary and sufficient conditions to test the schedulability of the human multi-agent collaborative task. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheduling algorithm using Matlab simulations. It shows that the proposed algorithm guarantees the effective real-time scheduling of the human multi-agent collaboration system while ensuring a proper level of mutual trust.

In the first framework, the predictive trajectory guidance itself is configured in a tracking mode where the control inputs computed by the model predictive control act as targets for some lower-level control system acting on the steering, brakes or engine. In the second framework, the state trajectories computed by the predictive trajectory guidance module are configured to be tracked by a non-predictive state tracking controller derived via input/output linearization. In both frameworks, the main considerations are driven by the time scales selected for computational expediency of the predictive guidance module, its update rate, and for control of the lower-level dynamics. The performance of the two frameworks, including the computational aspects, are compared considering public road driving as well as high performance race line scenarios.

The first model is that of an aquatic robot that swims like a fish. The second is a modified version of Chaplygin's sleigh, a canonical nonholonomic system, that can move on the ground or a rigid surface. It is shown that a governing principle underlying the locomotion of both systems is the existence of a nonholonomic constraint. Having identified the common framework of non integrable constraints, an aquatic robot propelled by an internal rotor is presented.

S	Allam, Anirudh; Onori, Simona; Marelli, Stefano; Taborelli, Carlo			IEEE					Battery Health Management System for Automotive Applications: A retroactivity-based aging propagation study								2015 AMERICAN CONTROL CONFERENCE (ACC)		Proceedings of the American Control Conference						703	716					2015	2015	Advances in lithium-ion battery technology have created new opportunities for this energy storage system to penetrate much deeper into the transportation sector, especially through automotive hybridization. In automotive applications, managing and optimizing the safety and reliability of batteries is of great interest for both users and manufacturers. To this purpose, battery management system (BMS) implements critical tasks such as monitoring battery health status, charge control, and cell balancing together with the evaluation of state of charge, state of health, and state of life. In this paper, we focus on BMS tasks related to the battery health management. We first cover main definitions, terminology and concept of batteries in automotive applications. An electrical-thermal-aging model of the battery cell is proposed, which is written in terms of fast (i. e. state of charge) and slow (i. e. state of health) dynamics. The time-scale separation of the proposed model is characterized quantitatively. A framework to analyze the propagation of aging from cell-to-cell within a battery pack is developed and the properties of an interconnected system from a degradation standpoint are studied. Further, a generalized framework for interconnected cells exhibiting the phenomenon of retroctivity is described. In addition, the effect of retroactivity and the extent of aging propagation are evaluated in a series and parallel topology, first and in a mixed series-parallel battery con figuration later.

The switched linear quadratic regulator (SLQR) is utilized as a method of determining when control of the autonomous vehicle should be switched from autonomous control to manual teleoperation or vice versa. This switching is determined by a quadratic cost function that takes into account both robot performance and human workload. A linearized model of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) is derived and used for the purpose of simulations of the proposed controller. The performance of the proposed controller is also compared to that of a fully autonomous and fully manual control.

IEEE					Static Uncertainty Analysis of a Wind Turbine Test Bench's Load Application Unit								2015 AMERICAN CONTROL CONFERENCE (ACC)		Proceedings of the American Control Conference						3150	3155					2015	2015	Modern wind turbine test benches include devices for applying non-torque loads to the driveline of the device under test. The device studied in this paper works by using hydraulic actuators to apply forces to a large disk that is part of and rotates with the driveline. The applied actuator loads result in a net linear force and net moment at the nacelle's control point (point along the driveline that corresponds to what would be the center of the blade hub). Direct measurement of the resulting control point loads is difficult due to their magnitudes (up to 2 million Newtons of linear force and 10 million Newton-meters of bending moment). The current strategy is to use actuator pressure measurements to estimate the loading at the control point. This paper investigates the sources and effects of uncertainty on static, control point load estimation.

In this paper, a predictive control framework is outlined that connects both areas. Specifically, a trajectory guidance module is posed as a nonlinear model predictive controller that computes the optimal future vehicle trajectory using information from environmental sensing for other objects as well as by imposing public traffic rules. It is also sought to minimize the number of vehicle specific parameters needed for the guidance by adopting a particular particle motion description for the vehicle. The computed control input set for the trajectory guidance is passed as a reference for lowerlevel vehicle dynamics control systems. The definitions of the objective functions and constraints and the adopted vehicle motion model allow for a unified predictive trajectory guidance scheme for fully autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles in public traffic with multiple dynamic objects. The performance of the proposed scheme is illustrated via simulations of an autonomous and a semi-autonomous vehicle in a few traffic scenarios such as intersections and collision avoidance. Execution time considerations are also analyzed.

Specifically, a stepped-concurrent layer-by-layer process is offered as a solution for overcoming the challenge of maintaining through-cure during thick-part fabrication using Ultraviolet (UV) radiation inputs that are subject to in-domain attenuation. The layering and curing sequence is modeled as a hybrid system, where the layering steps constitute discrete events on otherwise continuous curing kinetics and thermal processes. It is shown that the UV intensity as well as the inter-layer hold times can be selected optimally by posing an optimal control problem with the objective of minimizing the overall cure deviation in the thick multi-layer part. The necessary conditions for optimality are explicitly derived by adjoining the coupled PDE and ODE constraints of the process model. The potential benefit of the proposed optimization scheme is demonstrated considering simulations of a composite laminate curing process. It is found that, compared to traditional equal-interval layering, optimal layering time control gives significantly improved performance in terms of minimizing cure-level deviation, for comparable total energy usage. There is also some added benefit to optimizing the inter-layer UV input as well.

First, a control-oriented multi-in put-multi-output (MIMO) process model is adopted that captures the coupled nonlinear dynamics of deposited layer height and average melting pool temperature, with laser power and scanning speed as process inputs. Then, a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) scheme is devised in a transformed spatial coordinate system for simultaneous online control of deposition height and melting pool temperature. The conditions that ensure the closed-loop stability of the proposed control scheme are also provided. The effectiveness of the approach as well as the clear trade-offs in the multivariable control is illustrated via a case study on a single layer deposition process.

First, the various components of a multi-physics model of LAPD processes are briefly reviewed including the laser-powder interaction, heat transfer with phase change, fluid flow and surface deformation. The difficulty of capturing these nonlinear, coupled, spatio-temporal multi-physical interactions via lumped parameter modeling is highlighted. Then, a new MIMO model is derived in Hammerstein form by concatenating a linearized dynamics with coupled nonlinear relationships derived from mass and heat balance considerations. This MIMO model captures the coupled dynamics with laser power and scanning speed as inputs and deposited layer height and melting pool temperature as outputs. To identify the unknown model parameters, a constrained optimization problem is solved using the detailed multi-physics models. The MIMO model is in a form suitable for multivariable control designs for LAPD processes.

This paper proposes a fast and reliable Quadratic Programming (QP) strategy to solve MPC problems. While the optimal control action is calculated with a fast online dual QP algorithm, a "warm start" technique is adopted to reduce iterations of the online search process. The warm start solution is calculated from a predicted active constraint set generated by a pattern recognition function (Artificial Neural Network, ANN, is discussed). This function is calibrated with data from Monte Carlo simulation of the MPC controller over finite sampling points of the state-space. The proposed MPC strategy can adapt to applications with long prediction/control horizons, Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) dynamics and time varying constraints with balance between computation time, memory requirement and calibration effort. This MPC approach is applied to control vehicle speed for a HIL driving cycle test on an engine dynamometer. Simulation results demonstrate the speed profile tracking error of the MPC "driver" can be 67% less than a PID "driver". Furthermore, smooth throttle/brake actuations, similar to human drivers are achieved with the MPC controller.

A Bayesian sequential decision-making strategy is first proposed for the optimal allocation of manual and autonomous sensing mode in the presence of sensing uncertainty. However, this type of optimal strategy is not always the style of human decision-making. In particular, regret has been shown to play a critical role in rational decision-making. Humans experience regret when they perceive that they are better off with another option and tend to make choices to avoid such experience. Furthermore, it has been shown that team members share a same mental model perform better than teams with a more accurate but less similar mental model. Therefore, to enable more effective human-agent collaboration (HAC) and better overall task performance, we embed regret analysis into the proposed decision-making framework to provide suboptimal but more human-like decisions. We compare simulation results of decision-making strategies with and without regret analysis and show that regret-based decision-making can integrate human tendency in risk-averse and risk-seeking for better HAC.

S	Yan, Li; Shen, Haiying; Chen, Kang			IEEE					TSearch: Target-Oriented Low-Delay Node Searching in DTNs with Social Network Properties								2015 IEEE CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS (INFOCOM)		IEEE INFOCOM												2015	2015	Node searching in delay tolerant networks (DTNs) is of great importance for different applications, in which a locator node finds a target node in person. In the previous distributed node searching method, a locator traces the target along its movement path from its most frequently visited location. For this purpose, nodes leave traces during their movements and also store their long-term movement patterns in their frequently visited locations (i.e., preferred locations). However, such tracing leads to a long delay and high overhead on the locator by long-distance moving. Our trace data study confirms these problems and provides foundation of our design of a new node searching method, called target-oriented method (TSearch). By leveraging social network properties, TSearch aims to enable a locator to directly move towards the target. Nodes create encounter records (ERs) indicating the locations and times of their encounters and make the ERs easily accessible by locators through message exchanges or a hierarchical structure. In node searching, a locator follows the target's latest ER, the latest ERs of its friends (i.e., frequently meeting nodes), and its preferred locations in order. Extensive trace-driven and real-world experiments show that TSearch achieves significantly higher success rate and lower delay in node searching compared with previous methods.					34th IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)34th IEEE Conference on Computer Communications (INFOCOM)	APR 26-MAY 01, 2015APR 26-MAY 01, 2015	IEEEIEEE	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINAHong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0743-166X		978-1-4799-8381-0	WOS:000370720100208

The advances in technology have allowed bullying to take an online form, where bullies can remain anonymous and access their targets 24 hours a day. The online bullying has left school leaders in a legal dilemma as to how and when to address an incident that occurs off school grounds. The laws which guide school leaders are found at the state level. The major inconsistencies between state laws are illustrated in this chapter. The findings in recent research reveal that some state bullying laws define specific terms such as electronic communication, and intimidation, and harassment. Some state laws provide a detailed protocol for how teachers and administrators should report and handle online bullying that has an impact on the school environment. However, some states leave developing a protocol up to individual school districts. The varying school cyberbullying laws and policies mean that leaders across the United States do not have a unified way to handle issues originating off-campus. However, school leaders should have a comprehensive policy which helps to address cyberbullying issues. This chapter includes a critical examination of current laws in the states and a review of proposed federal statutes presently stalled in the U.S. Congress.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1479-3660		978-1-78560-576-5; 978-1-78560-577-2	WOS:000367645000002
