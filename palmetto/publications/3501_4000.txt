The U.S. Department of Education wrote in a 2014 "Dear Colleague Letter" (Guidance) that its office "has received an ever-increasing number of complaints concerning the bullying of students with disabilities and the effects of that bullying on their education, including on the special education and related services to which they are entitled" (p. 1). The Guidance as well as recent litigation illustrates how plaintiffs have alleged violations under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and/or the Americans with Disabilities Act when students with disabilities are bullied in schools. In this chapter, after discussing the related literature and the legal context, we examine several illustrative recent cases and the 2014 Guidance to highlight the relevant issues for school leaders. We conclude with recommendations and emphasize that school leaders must become knowledgeable about this emerging legal topic. Specifically, with a greater understanding of how they can prevent and respond to the bullying of students with disabilities, school leaders have the power to make great social change within schools.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1479-3660		978-1-78560-576-5; 978-1-78560-577-2	WOS:000367645000003

Unfortunately, this defect in understanding permeates American educational institutions, from the lowest grades to higher education and even professional schools. Students' pervasive ability to engage in technological speech and expression further complicates the issue, especially when inappropriate or offensive speech originating outside school crosses the geographic boundary and enters school. School administrators at all levels, challenged with maintaining atmospheres of safety and security conducive to learning, are being asked to respond to such student speech, but they fear to exceed the limits of their authority. Cyberbullying and harassing communications continue to distract victims and educators and detract from the quality of education at all institutions. The legal system and judiciary provide little guidance, and what guidance there is suffers from lack of consistent definitions and conflicting analyses. This chapter will review the jurisprudence pertaining to the First Amendment as applied to the school setting. The emphasis will be on legislative, judicial, and societal responses to cyberbullying and cyber harassment in the school setting, from the elementary level to higher education. Finally, recommendations for policies and procedures for dealing with cyberbullying and cyber harassment in schools will be presented.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1479-3660		978-1-78560-576-5; 978-1-78560-577-2	WOS:000367645000004

Doe the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that undocumented children cannot be denied a public education. Yet, as this chapter is being written in 2015, states across the United States have passed statutes preventing the education of these children and by practical extension documented children and their families. A package of Executive Actions by President Obama in November of 2014 modestly benefited and impacted the rights of undocumented immigrants, but did not challenge the state laws affecting school children and university students. In this chapter, we will review the rights to education of immigrant children. We will review the national scene as it stands amidst confusion in the absence of meaningful immigration reform by the U.S. Congress and the puzzle of the states arbitrarily denying rights flowing from the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, carefully articulated in Plyler. We intend to present a blunt portrait of rights denied and children left behind.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1479-3660		978-1-78560-576-5; 978-1-78560-577-2	WOS:000367645000005

Language is developed through social experiences, modeling, observing, and experimenting. Yet our educational system operates on the premise that typically developing children enter kindergarten, at age five with a firm foundation in speaking and listening, and equivalent exposures to pre-literacy skills (Roseberry-McKibben, 2007). For many children who speak a first language other than English, this is not the case. Typically, their first language is not supported in school, and the expectation is that they will learn to speak, communicate, and use English in order to understand grade level core content. Thus, they begin their education at a disadvantage. For many children this expectation creates an initial learning knowledge gap that appears to widen annually. This chapter will examine the literature related to language development and second language learning and the laws and mandates that drive our classroom practice.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1479-3660		978-1-78560-576-5; 978-1-78560-577-2	WOS:000367645000006

A number of weaknesses and struggles in the field of EL education have been simmering below the surface for years, and while previously treated as an unspoken dysfunction in our education system, the inequitable treatment of ELs can no longer be ignored. There is an urgent need to ensure equitable, inclusive, high-quality educational opportunities and outcomes for ELs, including preparation for college and career readiness. This study relies on two established legal policy research methodologies, specifically the four-step method of analysis and the quantitative method of "simple-box scoring," to systematically analyze case law outcomes and identify seven litigation trends from cases over the past 40 years. This research can provide alternative proactive remedies other than costly litigation and demonstrates the need for a more effective coordination of mechanisms to unite institutions that service ELs. This study bridges the gap of critical knowledge needed to help educators, attorneys, and professors who prepare school leaders and teachers to meet legal requirements for ELs, each of whom are entitled by law to access mainstream curriculum. Further limitations and implications are presented.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1479-3660		978-1-78560-576-5; 978-1-78560-577-2	WOS:000367645000007

Most recently, the CDC estimates that an average of one in 88 children have an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In terms of numbers, this translates into approximately 730,000 people between the ages of 0 and 21 who have ASD. While the primary cause(s) of increases in the identification of autistic students continue to generate debate school officials across the nation need to be prepared for the changing legal landscape associated with children diagnosed with ASD. The primary purpose of this chapter is to provide a detailed legal/policy update of the leading legal considerations and concerns involving K-12 students with autism. The chapter will discuss four specific legal topics involving the identification and eligibility of K-12 students with autism. These four legal topics include: Changes in the New DSM-5 Diagnostic Manuel and its Impact on Legal Definitions of Autism; Insurance Reform and Autism Coverage: A Comparison of the States; Developing Legally Compliant Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) for High-Functioning Students with Autism, and; Recent Legal Developments in Case Law Involving K-12 students who are autistic. The chapter will conclude with a detailed discussion of how today's school officials can become more legally literate and better serve the legal needs of students with autism in their schools.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1479-3660		978-1-78560-576-5; 978-1-78560-577-2	WOS:000367645000008

Using education attainment data obtained from the U.S. Census, this study examined the influence of educational attainment on how searches of students were conducted and the relative legal and judicial outcomes. The results of this study offer insight on issues related to forms of discipline in public schools and contribute to knowledge bases in the fields of economics, law, social theory, and educational leadership and administration.Prior studies regarding the Fourth Amendment in schools focused largely on administrative decisions, judgments, and practices, but the aspect of educational attainment has been minimally investigated. Findings suggest community educational attainment has little to no predictive influence on aspects related to student searches examined in the study, which include the intrusiveness level of the search and the number of searches occurring during a single search event. Implications for future research and leadership are discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1479-3660		978-1-78560-576-5; 978-1-78560-577-2	WOS:000367645000009

Tribal peoples residing in native communities typically view revitalization of indigenous language as a crucial first step in achieving the cross-cultural goal of school success for all tribal children. Inclusion of indigenous languages serves multiple purposes such as transmitting traditional cultural values, supporting overall academic achievement, and fostering self-determination and independence for native communities. Title III and Title VII of the No Child Left Behind Act are the designated policy "homes" for indigenous language inclusion and the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act addresses indigenous language as an obstacle to overcome, giving the unintended impression that native languages are somehow situated within a deficit framework of poverty and special education. This chapter explores the foundations of the inclusion of native languages into current federal policy and argues that the placement might be better suited as stand-alone legislation in order to more effectively promote community development and self-determination for Native American peoples.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1479-3660		978-1-78560-576-5; 978-1-78560-577-2	WOS:000367645000010

According to the 2014 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, homelessness continues to be a pervasive concern, particularly for children under the age of 18 who account for nearly 25% (135,701) of homeless individuals, and youth between 18 and 24 who represent nearly 10% (58,601) of the homeless population. Despite the statutory protections afforded by McKinney-Vento, a number of barriers persist and prevent full enjoyment of the basic rights established by the Act. Overcoming these barriers in the courts has provided some relief, but is insufficient given the limits of McKinney-Vento. Thus, homeless students and families need school leaders who promote social justice and educational opportunities to prepare them for meaningful participation in democratic society. This chapter provides analysis regarding the legal rights of homeless youth, including an overview of significant cases and federal policy updates, and concludes with several recommendations for school leaders to establish clear guidelines and implement procedures to address the educational needs of homeless students.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1479-3660		978-1-78560-576-5; 978-1-78560-577-2	WOS:000367645000011

SROs have become commonplace in American schools, but support for their continued work is meeting more resistance from those who feel that schools need to be focused on education and not police actions. The responsibilities of SROs are similar to regular police officers in that they have the ability to make arrests, respond to calls for service, and document incidents that occur within their jurisdiction. They are expected to be more than a law enforcement officer; they are expected to be leaders, educate students about law-related topics; be a role model to youth; and typically have additional duties to include mentoring and conducting presentations on youth-related issues. SRO programs receive valuable augmented training from a partner in school safety, the non-profit organization - National Association of School Resource Officers (NASRO). Towards this end, we will: (1) provide a historical context of SRO programs in the United States, (2) highlight concerns and challenges of school communities, (3) briefly present the case of SRO in Los Angeles, and (4) highlight implications for educational leadership.

While the Supreme Court ruled in Tinker that students do not shed their rights at the schoolhouse gate, in the Kuhlmeier and Fraser decisions the Court gave school officials greater latitude in regulating student speech, especially when it bears the imprimatur of the school. However, in its Frederick decision, the Court established school officials as the arbiters of the meaning of student speech. This chapter will explore the underlying values in schools that rejected the speech of Fraser while accepting the speech act of cheerleaders' dance routines. It will examine how the interpretation of these speech acts by school officials contributes to gender reproduction, with all the inequalities imposed.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1479-3660		978-1-78560-576-5; 978-1-78560-577-2	WOS:000367645000013

According to the most recent data from the National Center for Education Statistics, labor costs differ by more than 50% from the lowest-cost district to the highest-cost district within California, Florida, New York, Texas, and West Virginia. Furthermore, all states but Hawaii and Rhode Island face at least a 7.7% internal differential in labor cost. Most states fail to account for such cost differences in their school finance formulas, leading to inequitable differences in school district purchasing power. This chapter compares and contrasts the various strategies states use to make geographic cost adjustments to their school funding formula, describes the implications of geographic adjustment for interstate and intrastate measures of school finance equity (and corresponding litigation), and discusses the impact that such adjustments could have on the distribution of federal aid for economically disadvantaged students under Title 1 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1479-3660		978-1-78560-576-5; 978-1-78560-577-2	WOS:000367645000014

Its reach extends to consequential issues such as teacher evaluation and pay, to name a few. Because of this close link, education stakeholders disagree about the role of bargaining in education. On the one hand, some argue for the complete elimination of bargaining rights of teachers. This, according to some, will allow administrators the freedom to implement necessary reforms without the obligation to negotiate with unions. On the other hand, some note that collective bargaining provides a channel for teachers to voice their expertise in education. Under this view, bargaining is an essential component of advancing policy initiatives. Regardless, because collective bargaining is a creature of state statute, any modifications to those rights must occur by operation of law. Put another way, the law concerning collective bargaining plays a pivotal role in moderating the influence of unions and administrators regarding education policy. Given this interrelationship, a thorough exploration of the issue is warranted. Accordingly, this chapter will: (1) discuss the historical and legal framework of collective bargaining in public education; (2) highlight the ongoing debate regarding the appropriate role, if any, of it (and unions) in education policies; (3) identify significant changes to collective bargaining statutes that have occurred or have been proposed; (4) suggest recommendations to policy-makers and leaders that will assist them in understanding both the potential and the limits of collective bargaining in improving schools.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1479-3660		978-1-78560-576-5; 978-1-78560-577-2	WOS:000367645000015

Currently, the SCHDM only allows a TWLTL width of 15 ft to be used in design, and the distribution of TWLTL widths observed in a field study were justly limited; this limitation disallowed a proper evaluation of operational effects of TWLTL width. A fully integrated, high-fidelity driving simulator was used to test the operational effects of a range of TWLTL widths. Sixty participants made a series of left turns from a development driveway into TWLTLs of various widths. The TWLTL simulator scenarios included three-lane and five-lane road cross-section configurations and TWLTL widths of 12, 14, and 16 ft. Analyses were performed to determine the effects of (a) TWLTL width on driver gap acceptance and (b) turning-vehicle encroachments into through lanes. Analysis of variance tests indicated that TWLTL widths of 12, 14, and 16 ft had no effect on gap acceptance for three-lane and five-lane roadway sections. Trajectories were compared for a random sample of participants to evaluate the effect of TWLTL widths on vehicle encroachments into through lanes. On the basis of a subset of 30 participants, only one encroachment was observed for the scenario with a width of 12 ft, and two encroachments for the scenarios with widths of 14 and 16 ft. Greater variation in lane position was observed for wider TWLTLs, as participants took advantage of the larger space for maneuvering.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0361-1981	2169-4052		WOS:000371190300016

Second, the life cycle analysis is improved by using specific electricity and material inventory based on disassembled Suniva panels for which the actual material inventory has been compiled. The results from the U.S. lifecycle assessment using standard lifecycle inventory shows that modules entirely made in China or assembled in U.S. from Chinese solar cells have a similar carbon footprint. However, the complete manufacturing of panels in the U.S. reduces the carbon footprint by 13 to 22% because of the difference in the energy mix and the reduction in transportation. By incorporating the data from dismantling and digesting modules, the use of metals in small quantities is accounted for, unlike previous studies, and allows for a more complete environmental comparison. Evaluating the metal use in PV modules shows the metal usage in the U.S. manufactured c-Si module is four times higher than other scenarios.

The isolation of substantial numbers of viral sequence variants at highly variable viral protein domains remains a major challenge. We previously developed a combinatorial method for the isolation of novel sequences to cope with rapid viral variations at the G-H loop of Foot and Mouth Disease virus VP1 protein [1]. Here we present a namely:removal of potentially stressful region which harbored a stretch of basic amino acids to increase the success rates of gene cloning, and to streamline the process of future engineering of novel viral variants.clustered randomization in a full-length gene, as the positive rate for partial gene fragment libraries was extremely low before enrichment in the previous FMDV studies.the use of fusion partner was avoided, which was used previously for protein expression, stabilization of clones and reduction of stresses on host cells.the use of Poisson distribution is proposed to approximate sequencing output to achieve cost effectiveness.

BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES				38						e57	10.1017/S0140525X14000703			2015	2015	Kline succeeds in demonstrating the value of an approach that integrates information from various scientific and social disciplines, but her framework does not uniformly provide clarity. Specifically, inclusion of situations in which knowledgeable individuals do not actively donate information is misguided. Passive tolerance by demonstrators should continue to be excluded from definitions of teaching, in order to focus on situations in which selection has favored behaviors that are specifically geared to promoting learning in others.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0140-525X	1469-1825		WOS:000370070900057	26787449

Given the power of genomics and declining sequencing costs, biology is an emerging "Big Data" discipline that will soon enter the exabyte data range when all subdisciplines are combined. These datasets must be transferred across commercial and research networks in creative ways since sending data without thought can have serious consequences on data processing time frames. Thus, it is imperative that biologists, bioinformaticians, and information technology engineers recalibrate data processing paradigms to fit this emerging reality. This review attempts to provide a snapshot of Big Data transfer across networks, which is often overlooked by many biologists. Specifically, we discuss four key areas: 1) data transfer networks, protocols, and applications; 2) data transfer security including encryption, access, firewalls, and the Science DMZ; 3) data flow control with software-defined networking; and 4) data storage, staging, archiving and access. A primary intention of this article is to orient the biologist in key aspects of the data transfer process in order to frame their genomics-oriented needs to enterprise IT professionals.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1177-9322			WOS:000368578000002	26568680	
J	Gudenas, Brian L.; Wang, Liangjiang								Gene Coexpression Networks in Human Brain Developmental Transcriptomes Implicate the Association of Long Noncoding RNAs with Intellectual Disability								BIOINFORMATICS AND BIOLOGY INSIGHTS				9				21	27		10.4137/BBI.S29435		1	2015	2015	The advent of next-generation sequencing for genetic diagnoses of complex developmental disorders, such as intellectual disability (ID), has facilitated the identification of hundreds of predisposing genetic variants. However, there still exists a vast gap in our knowledge of causal genetic factors for ID as evidenced by low diagnostic yield of genetic screening, in which identifiable genetic causes are not found for the majority of ID cases. Most methods of genetic screening focus on protein-coding genes; however, noncoding RNAs may outnumber protein-coding genes and play important roles in brain development. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) specifically have been shown to be enriched in the brain and have diverse roles in gene regulation at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. LncRNAs are a vastly uncharacterized group of noncoding genes, which could function in brain development and harbor ID-predisposing genetic variants. We analyzed lncRNAs for coexpression with known ID genes and affected biological pathways within a weighted gene coexpression network derived from RNA-sequencing data spanning human brain development. Several ID-associated gene modules were found to be enriched for lncRNAs, known ID genes, and affected biological pathways. Utilizing a list of de novo and pathogenic copy number variants detected in ID probands, we identified lncRNAs overlapping these genetic structural variants. By integrating our results, we have made a prioritized list of potential ID-associated lncRNAs based on the developing brain gene coexpression network and genetic structural variants found in ID probands.									3	0	0	2	0	3			1177-9322			WOS:000368578000003	26523118	
J	Atamturktur, Sez; Farajpour, Ismail								Resource allocation for code development in partitioned models								ENGINEERING COMPUTATIONS				32	7			1981	2004		10.1108/EC-05-2014-0111			2015	2015	Purpose - Physical phenomena interact with each other in ways that one cannot be analyzed without considering the other. To account for such interactions between multiple phenomena, partitioning has become a widely implemented computational approach. Partitioned analysis involves the exchange of inputs and outputs from constituent models (partitions) via iterative coupling operations, through which the individually developed constituent models are allowed to affect each other's inputs and outputs. Partitioning, whether multi-scale or multi-physics in nature, is a powerful technique that can yield coupled models that can predict the behavior of a system more complex than the individual constituents themselves. The paper aims to discuss these issues.Design/methodology/approach - Although partitioned analysis has been a key mechanism in developing more realistic predictive models over the last decade, its iterative coupling operations may lead to the propagation and accumulation of uncertainties and errors that, if unaccounted for, can severely degrade the coupled model predictions. This problem can be alleviated by reducing uncertainties and errors in individual constituent models through further code development. However, finite resources may limit code development efforts to just a portion of possible constituents, making it necessary to prioritize constituent model development for efficient use of resources. Thus, the authors propose here an approach along with its associated metric to rank constituents by tracing uncertainties and errors in coupled model predictions back to uncertainties and errors in constituent model predictions.Findings - The proposed approach evaluates the deficiency (relative degree of imprecision and inaccuracy), importance (relative sensitivity) and cost of further code development for each constituent model, and combines these three factors in a quantitative prioritization metric. The benefits of the proposed metric are demonstrated on a structural portal frame using an optimization-based uncertainty inference and coupling approach.Originality/value - This study proposes an approach and its corresponding metric to prioritize the improvement of constituents by quantifying the uncertainties, bias contributions, sensitivity analysis, and cost of the constituent models.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0264-4401	1758-7077		WOS:000368249300006

Clemson University's CI program combines engaged learning and undergraduate research. We have developed a highly effective hands-on CI project involving soil inventory of private lands using the Web Soil Survey to identify soil map units, collected soil samples in the field, analyzed them in the Clemson University Agricultural Service Laboratory, and interpreted the soil testing results for management recommendations. Clemson University students from various fields (forestry, wildlife biology, environmental science, agricultural education, etc.) have conducted soil inventories of private lands in the Forestry and Natural Resources (FNR) class FNR 4700: GIS and SIS Applications course taught from 2007 to 2015 (60 students total). Students were asked to fill out a survey (2013, 2014, and 2015) consisting of questions related to their learning experience and the usefulness of their CI project, as well as to their overall satisfaction with the CI program. Responses to the survey questions indicated that the CI project improved the student's confidence in successfully performing various research tasks. Students strongly agreed that teaching undergraduates how to conduct research should be an important goal of the university. Overall, student responses to the questionnaire about their CI project experience were positive, indicating that incorporating project-based learning can enhance soil science education.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2168-8273	2168-8281		BCI:BCI201600151826		
J	Bolotova, Yuliya V.; Novakovic, Andrew M.								An Empirical Analysis of Wholesale Cheese Pricing Practices on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Spot Cheese Market								INTERNATIONAL FOOD AND AGRIBUSINESS MANAGEMENT REVIEW				18	3			49	66					2015	2015	The CME spot cheese market performs a number of key functions in the United States dairy industry. The CME spot cheese prices are used as reference prices in contract cheese market, and they also influence milk prices at the farm-first-handler level set within a public pricing system, the Federal and State Milk Marketing Orders. The CME spot cheese market performs a critical price-discovery function in the United States dairy industry. This research evaluates the nature of pricing practices used by CME cheese wholesalers during the period of 2000-2014. The analysis focuses on the farm-to-wholesale price transmission process, which reflects the nature of cost pass-through. The empirical evidence presented in the article indicates that pricing strategies of cheese sellers in the analyzed market are consistent with the ones predicted by the profit-maximization models of oligopolistic behavior. The overall empirical evidence may suggest that cheese sellers on the CME spot cheese market used an output (cheese) price stabilization method during the analyzed period of time.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1559-2448			WOS:000360582800004		
J	Kabbani, Nabil M.; Welch, Daniel; Priester, Caleb; Schaub, Stephen; Durkee, Blair; Sun, Yu-Shan; Sitaraman, Murali								Formal Reasoning Using an Iterative Approach with an Integrated Web IDE								ELECTRONIC PROCEEDINGS IN THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE					187			56	71		10.4204/EPTCS.187.5			2015	2015	This paper summarizes our experience in communicating the elements of reasoning about correctness, and the central role of formal specifications in reasoning about modular, component-based software using a language and an integrated Web IDE designed for the purpose. Our experience in using such an IDE, supported by a 'push-button' verifying compiler in a classroom setting, reveals the highly iterative process learners use to arrive at suitably specified, automatically provable code. We explain how the IDE facilitates reasoning at each step of this process by providing human readable verification conditions (VCs) and feedback from an integrated prover that clearly indicates unprovable VCs to help identify obstacles to completing proofs. The paper discusses the IDE's usage in verified software development using several examples drawn from actual classroom lectures and student assignments to illustrate principles of design-by-contract and the iterative process of creating and subsequently refining assertions, such as loop invariants in object-based code.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2075-2180			WOS:000367338000006

The melt-spinning of continuous polymer fibers with controllable diameters from 35 to 150 mm and their pyrolysis to ceramic SiCN fibers is not influenced by differences in the chemical structure of the polysilazanes. In contrast, the necessary e-beam curing dose is reduced by Si-vinyl groups from 600 kGy for ML33S (vinyl free) to 200 kGy for HTTS derived polymer fibers. The curing step leads to an enhanced handleability important for further pyrolysis at 1100 degrees C in nitrogen and to an increase in ceramic yield. The resulting ceramic SiCN fibers from both systems have similar mechanical and thermal behavior, indicating quite a low influence of the polysilazane type on these properties. For the first time a comprehensive investigation of the effect of fiber diameter on the tensile strength is reported for SiCN fibers. The average strength increases from similar to 800 MPa for 90 mm diameter fibers to similar to 1600 MPa for the 30 mm diameter fibers. Bend Stress Relaxation (BSR) tests demonstrated that no stress relaxation occurs up to 1000 degrees C for SiCN monofilaments and the creep resistance is equal to or better than commercially available SiC monofilaments produced by chemical vapour deposition (CVD). The oxidation resistance is also comparable to commercially available oxygen free CVD SiC fibers (SCS-6). The ceramic fibers in this study were pyrolyzed at low temperature (1100 degrees C) and have high oxygen content (13 to 29 wt%). The high temperature creep resistance and oxidation resistance is expected to improve if the oxygen content is reduced and the pyrolysis temperature increased.									3	0	0	0	0	3			2046-2069			WOS:000367274300078		
J	Afshinnia, Kaveh; Rangaraju, Prasada Rao								Mitigating Alkali-Silica Reaction in Concrete Effectiveness of Ground Glass Powder from Recycled Glass								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD					2508			65	72		10.3141/2508-08			2015	2015	This study investigated the effectiveness of using recycled waste glass in portland cement concrete, both as a finely ground powder and as a crushed granular material. For the potential of glass to undergo alkali silica reactivity (ASR) distress to be assessed, mortar bar and miniature concrete prism tests were conducted with glass as both a powder and a crushed material. Parallel studies were conducted with a crushed natural aggregate. Simultaneously, strength activity index and thermogravimetric analysis tests were conducted on cementitious mixtures to evaluate pozzolanic reactivity of glass powder when used as cement replacement material. Results showed that when glass powder (70 inn average size) was used as cement replacement material, its pozzolanic behavior (measured by thermogravimetric analysis and strength activity index) was minimal. When glass powder was used as aggregate replacement material, the combination of glass powder and ASR-prone coarse aggregates showed significantly lower expansion than did control specimens in accelerated mortar bar and miniature concrete prism tests. This result indicates the beneficial effect of using glass powder in mitigating expansion induced by ASR. The mechanism by which the fine glass powder appeared to alleviate ASR in coarse aggregates, and therefore any significant distress in test specimens, was by rapidly undergoing its own ASR, which depleted alkalinity in the vicinity of reactive coarse aggregates. ASR associated with the fine glass particles was localized, and the reaction product did not appear to generate sufficient expansion to cause global distress. Additional field studies are required to validate study findings before waste glass can be used in concrete on a large scale.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0361-1981	2169-4052		WOS:000367415200009		
J	Li, Zhengqi; Rangaraju, Prasada Rao								Effect of Sand Content on Properties of Self-Consolidating, High-Performance Cementitious Mortar								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD					2508			84	92		10.3141/2508-11			2015	2015	The workability and compressive strength of a high-performance cementitious mortar (HPCM) produced by using a natural siliceous sand were studied as a function of sand content [expressed as sand-to-cementitious materials ratio (s/cm)], silica fume (SF) content, and high-range water reducing admixture (HRWRA) dosage. The purpose of this study was to maximize the proportion of sand content without negatively affecting workability and mechanical and durability properties when these characteristics were achieved at a low cost. Test results indicated that the workability of HPCM became less sensitive to sand content when the SF content increased. Statistical analysis showed that the compressive strength of self-consolidating HPCM was not significantly affected by sand content up to a certain maximum level, which was dependent on the HRWRA and SF dosage. On the basis of combined consideration of both workability and compressive strength, the maximum s/cm ratio to produce a self-consolidating HPCM with SF content at 0%, 10%, and 20% was 1.6, 1.6, and 2.0, respectively. Also, increasing the sand content was helpful in improving the durability of HPCM, because chloride ion permeability and drying shrinkage decreased.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0361-1981	2169-4052		WOS:000367415200012

Combined biological and abiotic reactions with iron and Fe(III)-reducing microorganisms for remediation of explosives and insensitive munitions (IM)								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-WATER RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY				1	1			34	39		10.1039/c4ew00062e			2015	2015	Military explosives and insensitive munitions (IM) are a significant hazard to all natural and engineered environments. A number of remediation alternatives have been proposed and investigated in detail, and biological remediation has received a large amount of attention because the reactions can be cost effective and transform the contaminants to innocuous end products. Recently, investigators have begun to look at coupled biological and chemical reactions as way to accelerate the rate of explosives and IM transformation in groundwater, surface water, soil, and industrial wastewater. A number of these technologies are predicated on reactions involving iron, and the microorganisms that reduce ferric iron. These mixed "biological-chemical" reactions may be more effective at degrading the contaminants because the strategies do not rely on a single type of reaction or microorganism, but rather a suite of reactions taking place simultaneously or in series and microbial communities that catalyze similar reactions. The technologies investigated have primarily two mechanisms. The first is initially stimulating Fe(III)-reducing microbial activity, with the secondary chemical reactions with ferrous iron (or electron shuttling molecules) actually degrading the explosives or IM. The second approach is initial chemical treatment with zero valent iron followed by engineered or native microbial activity degrading the residual contamination. In both cases the chemistry and biology of the system and the specific contaminants are critical to environmental restoration. This Frontier Review will present recent advances in the field.									2	0	0	2	0	2			2053-1400	2053-1419		WOS:000366889800006

We also provide summaries on voltinism, crawler emergence timing, and predictive models for crawler emergence to assist in developing soft scale management programs. Phloemfeeding soft scale pests cause direct (e.g., injuries to plant tissues and removal of nutrients) and indirect damage (e.g., reduction in photosynthesis and aesthetic value by honeydew and sooty mold). Variations in life cycle, reproduction, fecundity, and behavior exist among congenerics due to host, environmental, climatic, and geographical variations. Sampling of soft scale pests involves sighting the insects or their damage, and assessing their abundance. Crawlers of most univoltine species emerge in the spring and the summer. Degree-day models and plant phenological indicators help determine the initiation of sampling and treatment against crawlers (the life stage most vulnerable to contact insecticides). The efficacy of cultural management tactics, such as fertilization, pruning, and irrigation, in reducing soft scale abundance is poorly documented. A large number of parasitoids and predators attack soft scale populations in the field; therefore, natural enemy conservation by using selective insecticides is important. Systemic insecticides provide greater flexibility in application method and timing, and have longer residual longevity than contact insecticides. Application timing of contact insecticides that coincides with crawler emergence is most effective in reducing soft scale abundance.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-7470			WOS:000367251500017

Biology and Management of Maconellicoccus hirsutus (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) on Ornamental Plants								JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT				6	1					5	10.1093/jipm/pmv004			JAN 2015	2015	Maconellicoccus hirsutus (Green) (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) is an invasive pest of horticultural and agricultural crops worldwide, with recent range expansion in the Americas and the Caribbean. Current populations of M. hirsutus in the southern United States are likely to spread to additional states primarily through transportation of ornamental plant materials. The rapid proliferation of this pest and its ability to severely impact many horticultural crops, particularly ornamental plants such as hibiscus, necessitate correct diagnosis and response to infestations. This article summarizes the current state of knowledge on M. hirsutus biology, ecology, and management. We discuss seasonal phenology, host range, damage characteristics, ecology, and monitoring strategies on ornamental plants. Insecticides remain the main management tools against M. hirsutus in ornamental plant nurseries. Biological control is the preferred management strategy in reducing infestation in urban landscapes. We note that inappropriate use of insecticides in landscapes may exacerbate problems with this pest, and that preferred responses should include assessment of biological control potential and economic or aesthetic thresholds of affected host plants. Information presented in this profile will help develop integrated management program for current and future invasions.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2155-7470			WOS:000367251500005

The minimum cardinality of a total dominating set is the total domination number gamma(t)(G). A Roman dominating function on a graph G is a function f : V(G) -> {0, 1, 2} satisfying the condition that every vertex u with f (u) = 0 is adjacent to at least one vertex v of G for which f (v) = 2. The minimum of f (V (G)) = Sigma(u is an element of V(G)) f(u) over all such functions is called the Roman domination number gamma(R)(G).

Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated the effects of varying the strength of nonspecific NP-protein attraction on amyloid aggregation of a model protein, the amyloid-beta peptide implicated in Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, with increasing NP-peptide attraction, amyloid aggregation on the NP surface was initially promoted due to increased local protein concentration on the surface and destabilization of the folded state. However, further increase of NP-peptide attraction decreased the stability of amyloid fibrils and reduced their lateral diffusion on the NP surface necessary for peptide conformational changes and self-association, thus prohibiting amyloid aggregation. Moreover, we found that the relative concentration between protein and NPs also played an important role in amyloid aggregation. With a high NP/protein ratio, NPs that intrinsically promote protein aggregation may display an inhibitive effect by depleting the proteins in solution while having a low concentration of the proteins on each NP's surface. Our coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation study offers a molecular mechanism for delineating the contrasting and seemingly conflicting effects of NP-protein attraction on amyloid aggregation and highlights the potential of tailoring anti-aggregation nanomedicine against amyloid diseases.									3	0	0	1	0	3			2046-2069			WOS:000366865900100		
J	Marion, Cathy A.; Scott, Mark C.; Kubach, Kevin M.								Multiscale Environmental Influences on Fish Assemblage Structure of South Atlantic Coastal Plain Streams								TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY				144	5			1040	1057		10.1080/00028487.2015.1059887			2015	2015	South Atlantic coastal plain streams are unique and understudied freshwater environments that provide crucial habitats for a wide range of aquatic taxa. We investigated patterns in fish assemblages across South Carolina's coastal plain, and developed statistical models to identify the dominant multiscale abiotic environmental factors that influence assemblage structure. Cluster and indicator species analyses of fish assemblage data collected at 208 wadeable streams indicated the presence of four predominant species associations that commonly occur in the South Atlantic coastal plain, which we termed the (1) fluvial, (2) Eastern Mudminnow, (3) centrarchid, and (4) nonfluvial assemblages. A random forest analysis indicated that geographic gradients and instream habitat variables associated with velocity, channel form, stream size, depth, and large wood generally played a greater role in distinguishing fish assemblages than catchment land cover. A follow-up principal component analysis showed that these instream habitat variables showed weak relationships with current anthropogenic land-cover conditions. We suggest several possible explanations for our findings, including (1) a sustained dynamic equilibrium among catchment, riparian, and instream conditions over time may encourage assemblage partitioning among differential instream habitats, (2) past landscape conditions may have a greater influence on current instream habitat conditions and fish assemblage structure than current landscape conditions, (3) weak relationships between catchment land cover and instream habitats may be common in low-elevation regions, and (4) seasonal variation in hydrologic patterns may dominantly influence instream habitat conditions and fish assemblage structure. Our study adds essential information towards a better understanding of how South Atlantic coastal plain fish assemblages respond to environmental factors across multiple spatial scales. Such knowledge will help improve management and conservation strategies, as well as assist in the development of appropriate indicators for standardized evaluations of ecological integrity.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0002-8487	1548-8659		WOS:000362668900015

This paper presents a systematic approach to evaluate how component interactions beyond the first order affect the interconnectivity of the product/system. A correlation between the higher order component interactions and the betweenness of the components is identified. This information is then used to identify relationships between different products and make inferences about additional systems that exhibit similar patterns. The methods are also applied to subsets of product configuration rules to understand whether or not the same relationship trends occur within product configuration as in product architecture.					20th International Conference on Engineering Design (ICED)20th International Conference on Engineering Design (ICED)	JUL 27-31, 2015JUL 27-31, 2015		Milan, ITALYMilan, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0	0			2220-4334		978-1-904670-70-4	WOS:000366305800020

The study analyzes producing economics articles within a production theory framework and develops an economics article production function, in which graphs and words are inputs. Analyzing the articles published in American Economic Review between 1911 and 2010, the study finds that number of words, time, editors, number of chart displays, number of equation lines, presence of female authors, and female-only authorship are the significant determinants of the use of graphs.

Laminates constructed of varying counts of pre-impregnated plies (Hexcel AS4/3501-6) are embedded with Terfenol-D particles and a delamination to observe changes in the sensing signal in and around the damage region. The testing apparatus consists of a primary circuit to generate a magnetic flux excitation and a secondary circuit to sense voltage induced into a pickup coil. In addition, three groups of test results were generated to observe the effect of fabrication on sensing. The experimental results from the three groups reveal that the particle distribution has a significant effect on the sensing signal. The sensing signal is dominated by changes in local particle distribution and the effect of the delamination and ply variation did not have a discernible effect on the sensing signal for this setup.					10th International Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring (IWSHM)10th International Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring (IWSHM)	SEP 01-03, 2015SEP 01-03, 2015	Natl Sci Fdn; Air Force Off Sci Res; Boeing; Airbus; Embraer; VerizonNatl Sci Fdn; Air Force Off Sci Res; Boeing; Airbus; Embraer; Verizon	Stanford Univ, Stanford, CAStanford Univ, Stanford, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-60595-275-8	WOS:000365445300010

To date, use areas at sea have been determined entirely from vessel-based surveys and opportunistic sightings and, as such, spatial and temporal gaps in our understanding of the species' marine range are likely. To enhance our understanding of marine use areas, we deployed satellite tags on 3 black-capped petrels breeding on Hispaniola, representing the first tracking study for this species and one of the first published tracking studies for any breeding seabird in the Caribbean. During chick rearing, petrels primarily used marine habitats in the southern Caribbean Sea (ca. 18.0 degrees to 11.5 degrees N, 70.0 degrees to 75.5 degrees W) between the breeding site and the coasts of Venezuela and Colombia. Maximum distance from the breeding sites ranged from ca. 500 to 1500 km during the chick-rearing period. During the post-breeding period, each bird dispersed north and used waters west of the Gulf Stream offshore of the mid-and southern Atlantic coasts of the USA as well as Gulf Stream waters and deeper pelagic waters east of the Gulf Stream. Maximum distance from the breeding sites ranged from ca. 2000 to 2200 km among birds during the nonbreeding period. Petrels used waters located within 14 different exclusive economic zones, suggesting that international collaboration will benefit the development of management strategies for this species.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1863-5407	1613-4796		WOS:000365699600003

Their pervasiveness, small size and autonomy, enlarges the potential of these devices to be employed in different activities and scenarios. Wearable devices collect data ubiquitously and continuously, about the individual user and also her surroundings, which can pose many privacy challenges that neither users nor stakeholders are ready to deal with. Before designing effective solutions for developing privacy-enhanced wearables, we need first to identify and understand what are the potential privacy concerns that users have and how they are perceived. To contribute to that purpose, in this paper we present findings from a qualitative content analysis of online comments regarding privacy concerns of wearable device users. We also discuss how form factors, sensors employed, and the type of data collected impact the users' perception of privacy. Our results show that users have different levels and types of privacy concerns depending on the type of wearable they use. By better understanding the users' perspectives about wearable privacy, we aim at helping designers and researchers to develop effective solutions to create privacy-enhanced wearables.					19th International Conference on Financial Cryptography and Data Security (FC)19th International Conference on Financial Cryptography and Data Security (FC)	JAN 26-30, 2015JAN 26-30, 2015		San Juan, PRSan Juan, PR	1	0	0	0	0	1			0302-9743		978-3-662-48051-9; 978-3-662-48050-2	WOS:000365880900017

Impacts of repeated wildfire on long-unburned plant communities of the southern Appalachian Mountains								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE				24	7			911	920		10.1071/WF14143			2015	2015	The infrequent occurrence of large wildfires in the southern Appalachian Mountains over the last several decades has offered few opportunities to study their impacts. From 2000 to 2008, five wildfires burned a large portion of the area in and surrounding the Linville Gorge Wilderness in North Carolina. Areas were burned either once or twice. The response of acid cove and thermic oak plant communities (structure, cover, richness, diversity) was measured in 78 vegetation monitoring plots, established in 1992 and remeasured in 2010-11. Fire altered forest structure in both communities, resulting in the mortality of larger trees and increases in the abundance of smaller (<5cm diameter at breast height (DBH)) stems. Burning twice decreased stem counts for mountain laurel (Kalmia latifolia) in both communities, whereas oaks (Quercus spp.) responded positively to burning twice in the thermic oak community. Table Mountain pine stem counts increased in acid cove and thermic oak communities burned once. Fire appears to promote princesstree (Paulownia tomentosa) invasion. Herbaceous species cover responded positively to fire (once or twice; both communities), with concurrent increases in woody species richness and diversity. Tree species composition in acid cove plots was not affected by burning, although some slight changes occurred in thermic oak plots burned twice.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1049-8001	1448-5516		WOS:000365188000004

However, these models usually cannot be generalized, due to the inherent uncertainties that exist in the process. These uncertainties may originate from machining, workpiece material composition, and measurements. A stochastic approach can be utilized to compensate for the lack of certainty in machining, particularly for tool wear evolution. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is a powerful tool for addressing uncertainties in machining parameter estimation. The Hybrid Metropolis-Gibbs algorithm has been chosen in this work to estimate the unknown parameters in a mechanistic tool wear model for end milling of difficult-to-machine alloys. The results show a good potential of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo modeling in prediction of parameters in the presence of uncertainties.					10th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC2015)10th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC2015)	JUN 08-12, 2015JUN 08-12, 2015	ASME, Mfg Engn DivASME, Mfg Engn Div	Charlotte, NCCharlotte, NC	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-5683-3	WOS:000365147200027

None of the existing architecture evaluation methods evaluate the unique aspects of the architectures that drive a software ecosystem. These architectures emphasize properties, such as Extensibility, Flexibility, and Scalability, that should be considered during an architecture evaluation. An evaluation method must also allow stakeholders, who are spread around the world, to participate in the evaluation. To address these issues, this paper proposes a method, Architectural Analysis Method for Evolving Ecosystems (AAMEE), to evaluate the architecture that is the basis for a software ecosystem. AAMEE, a variant of ATAM, analyzes architectural scenarios covering both the platform and product architectures in the ecosystem. The method has been piloted through its application to the architecture of the Noosfero ecosystem. We report some lessons learned.					9th European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA)9th European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA)	SEP 07-11, 2015SEP 07-11, 2015		Cavtat, CROATIACavtat, CROATIA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0302-9743		978-3-319-23727-5; 978-3-319-23726-8	WOS:000365861700030

For a preliminary assessment of the model's capabilities, one or more p-i-n junctions were allowed to fill the region between the front and back surfaces; the semiconductor layers were taken to be made from mixtures of three different alloys of hydrogenated amorphous silicon; empirical relationships between the complex-valued relative optical permittivity and the bandgap were used; a transparent-conducting-oxide layer was taken to be attached to the front surface of the solar cell; and a metallic reflector, which may be periodically corrugated, was supposed to be attached to the back surface. First the frequency-domain Maxwell postulates were solved in order to determine the absorption of solar photons and the subsequent generation of electron-hole pairs, with the AM1.5G solar spectrum taken to represent the incident solar flux. Next, the drift-diffusion equations were solved to track the evolution of electron and hole densities to a steady state. Preliminary numerical results from our model indicate that by increasing the number of p-i-n junctions from one to three, the solar-cell efficiency may be increased. The efficiency may be further increased by incorporating a periodically-corrugated back reflector, as opposed to a flat back reflector, in the case of a single p-i-n junction solar cell. We plan to apply the two-dimensional finite-element model for more complicated solar cells.

Localization and Compactness in Bergman and Fock Spaces								INDIANA UNIVERSITY MATHEMATICS JOURNAL				64	5			1553	1573					2015	2015	In this paper, we study the compactness of operators on the Bergman space of the unit ball and on very generally weighted Bargmann-Fock spaces in terms of the behavior of their Berezin transforms and the norms of the operators acting on reproducing kernels. In particular, in the Bergman space setting, we show how a vanishing Berezin transform combined with certain (integral) growth conditions on an operator T are sufficient to imply that the operator is compact. In the weighted Bargmann-Fock space setting, we show that the reproducing kernel thesis for compactness holds for operators satisfying similar growth conditions. The main results extend the results of Xia and Zheng to the case of the Bergman space when 1 < p < infinity; and in the weighted Bargmann-Fock space setting, our results provide new, more general conditions that imply the work of Xia and Zheng via a more familiar approach that can also handle the 1 <p < infinity case.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-2518	1943-5258		WOS:000364888600010

For reliable results, CBM systems need early and reliable warning based on prediction models that use multiple types of sensors. In this study, tool flank wear during end milling difficult-to-machine alloys was measured using an optical microscope. Then, vibration data collected with an accelerometer was investigated for its relationship to tool flank wear. The developed relationship between accelerometer output and tool flank wear was validated with further experiments. It was observed from frequency domain responses of these outputs that specific harmonics of the tool pass frequency were dominant, and tool flank wear can be related to the amplitude of these harmonics during machining. This way, it was shown that through accurate online prediction of tool wear, premature interruption of the process as well as machining with a worn tool can both be avoided, improving end-product quality as well as reducing machining costs.					10th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC2015)10th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC2015)	JUN 08-12, 2015JUN 08-12, 2015	ASME, Mfg Engn DivASME, Mfg Engn Div	Charlotte, NCCharlotte, NC	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-5682-6	WOS:000365146800113

An introduction to lightweight materials couples that of lightweight joining with a thermo-mechanical process, Flow Drill Screwdriving (FDS). This process is favored in terms of robustness, short installation time, and only requiring access to one side. The most significant challenge of this process is reducing the material sheet separation to minimize any possibility of corrosion buildup. Warm forming of aluminum has been shown to increase ductility and formability of the material and thus the process benefits from a reduced cycle time that leads to cost reduction. In this study, the effect of an auxiliary heat source on the flow of A16063 is investigated for the FDS application. In order to accomplish this task, a conduction-heating ring is implemented into the FDS process to raise the material temperature and thus reduce the total cycle time. Different preprocess material temperatures are studied to determine the effect of material temperature on the process time, installation torque, and sheet separation. As a result, with the thermal assistance, a reduction in the process time up to 52%, the maximum installation torque by 20%, and sheet separation by 11% were attained, indicating better quality joints at a lower cost.					10th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC2015)10th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference (MSEC2015)	JUN 08-12, 2015JUN 08-12, 2015	ASME, Mfg Engn DivASME, Mfg Engn Div	Charlotte, NCCharlotte, NC	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-5682-6	WOS:000365146800011

Researchers have been working on using assisted or augmented processes to overcome this challenge, with methods such as ultrasonically assisted, thermally assisted, vibration-assisted, magnetic field-assisted, and laser-assisted machining. Utilizing electrical assistance in manufacturing has not caught much attention due to its difficult-to-apply nature. However, it is possible to increase the ductility and machinability (through reduced flow stress) of certain metallic materials through the use of electricity. In this method, the electrical current resistively heats the material while aiding in deforming the material through the electroplastic effect.The limited amount of work in this topic is mainly focused on exploring the forming characteristics of relatively softer materials. Application of this augmentation to alloys with superior mechanical properties at elevated temperatures, on the other hand, has not been explored. This study aims to fill in that void through an investigation of applying different currents through the tool concentrated on the tool-workpiece contact zone. Both the titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V and the nickel-based superalloy IN-738 were investigated, and the results showed that for both materials, there are two separate thresholds that need to be considered in any analysis. The first threshold is where the material starts to get deformed, below which no significant divergence from the baseline (no current) tests was observed. After exceeding this value, machining forces start decreasing with increasing current up to a certain point (second threshold) where the effect of electric current is reversed. If the second threshold is surpassed, the machining forces increase rapidly.

Aspartic acid and histidine exhibited very high dihalogenated-HANs and HAAs formation during chlorination, but their reactivity significantly decreased after ozonation. Glycine followed by lysine yieled the highest level of HNMs and THMs formation during ozonation-chlorination, but they did not have measurable yields for either classes of DBPs during chlorination. All other AAs showed very low carbonaceous and nitrogenous DBP yields. The nitrosamine yields of all nine AAs were very low or below the minimum reporting levels during chloramination, ozonation, and ozonation-chloramination. These results indicated that the presence of AAs in natural waters can result in some contributions to certain halogenated DBPs depending on the oxidation conditions. However, they do not appear to be an important contributor to nitrosamines formation.

Although numerous studies have examined different strategies on the reduction of DBP formation in finished waters, their main focuses are on natural organic matter (NOM) in source waters. Few studies evaluated the contributions of bacterial organic matter (BOM) on DBP formation. Breaking down of bacterial cells, releasing BOM into water, is an essential process in water disinfection. Prevalence of bacterial contamination in source waters and occurrences of biofilms in water treatment units and distribution systems are frequently reported. The contributions of organic matter from bacterial and microbial sources in drinking water treatment cannot be ignored. In this study, we compared the contributions of bacterial cells and humic acid (HA), under controlled laboratory environments, on the DBP formation from chlorination. We also evaluated the effects of HA, pH, and chlorine dosage on both disinfection efficiency and DBP formation. The results showed that bacterial cells are also potential DBP precursor. Presence of HA not only increased the DBP formation, but also decreased the disinfection efficiency of chlorination. pH and chlorine dosage also affect the disinfection efficiency and DBP formation of chlorination. High dosage of chlorine would increase both the disinfection efficient and DBP formation, while low pH increase the disinfection efficient with a lower DBP formation. The results suggest that high disinfection efficiency with low DBP formation of chlorination can be achieved by optimization of operation conditions. Based on our knowledge, this pioneering work is the first study to investigate the relationship between bacteria and DBP contaminations in water treatment processes at the same time.

A Controlled Laboratory Study								RECENT ADVANCES IN DISINFECTION BY-PRODUCTS		ACS Symposium Series		1190				271	292					2015	2015	Detritus material in forested watersheds is the major terrestrial source of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and disinfection by-product (DBP) precursors in source waters. Forest fire reduces the thickness of detritus layer and changes foliar litters into pyrogenic organic matter (PyOM) on the forest floor, resulting in different quantity and quality of DOM exported from forested watersheds. Many studies have examined DBP precursors exported from forested watersheds; however, DOM leaching from PyOM, or dissolved black carbon (BC), could have different reactivity in DBP formation compared to the DOM leaching from unburned detritus layer. Using controlled laboratory burning in this study, characteristics of foliar litters before and after burn were compared. Quality and quantity of water extractable organic matter (WEOM) from raw and burned foliar litters commonly found in the southeastern United States, including baldcypress (Taxodium distichum), boxelder (Acer negundo), longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), pop ash (Fraxinus caroliniana), sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), and water tupelo (Nyssa aquatica) was compared, and evaluated for their disinfection by-product yield and specific DBP formation using a uniform formation condition test. Laboratory analysis using pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry showed that foliar litters after burn contain significantly less lignins, nitrogenous compounds, and polysaccharides because of loss of organic matter. However, both the formula numbers and relative abundance of PAHs increased, which can be a potential health concern. Water extractable organic carbon (WEOC) and total nitrogen (WETN) decreased after burn and in particular raw material had less humic acid and fulvic acid-like compounds. PyOM aromaticity may be either enhanced or lowered by prescribed fire and highly depending upon the plant species. The specific formation of chloroform (a prevalent DBP species) decreased by I2%-60% for all plant species after burn. However, dissolved BC was more reactive in the formation of nitrogenous disinfection by-products (N-DBPs), and the specific haloacetonitriles formation increased after burn for all species.

A Controlled Field Study								RECENT ADVANCES IN DISINFECTION BY-PRODUCTS		ACS Symposium Series		1190				293	306					2015	2015	Forest detritus material is one of the major terrestrial sources of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in source waters. There is a health concern on DOM because it reacts with disinfectants to form a variety of potentially carcinogenic disinfection by-products (DBPs) during drinking water treatments. Prescribed fire is a common forest management practice in Southeastern US to reduce the risks of wildfire and beetle infestation. However, this forest management practice alters the composition and quantity of detritus materials on forest floor, changing the DOM and DBP precursors exports from those forested watersheds. In this book chapter, we discussed a prescribed fire study conducted in three 20m x 20m experimental plots in Hobcaw Barony, Georgetown, South Carolina. Litter and duff mixtures of field samples before and after prescribed fire were collected for water extraction experiments in the laboratory. In addition, water extracts were further exposed to sunlight for 15 days in order to understand the biogeochemical processes on the degradability of DOM and DBP precursors. The concentrations of water extractable organic carbon (WEOC) and water extractable total nitrogen (WETN) from unburned detritus (60.3 g-WEOC/m(2) and 1.9 g-WETN/m(2)) were significantly greater than those from burned detritus (11.4 g-WEOC/m(2) and 0.5 g-WETN/m(2)). Importantly, the yield of DBP was significantly reduced from 3651 mg-THM/m(2) to 484 mg-THM/m(2) after fire. There was no change in specific DBP formation in both burn and unburned samples after sunlight exposure although significant decreases in ultraviolet absorbance and fluorescence intensity were observed. This field study showed that prescribed fire could significantly decrease the production of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved total nitrogen (DTN) per unit area in forest floor and potentially decrease the DBP formation in water supply.

This required disinfection practice also results in the formation of undesirable disinfection by-products (DBPs) from the reactions of chlorine with the organic matter (released by swimmers or present in the pool filling water) and inorganics (i.e., bromide). The main objective of this research was to improve our understanding of the occurrence and formation of different classes of DBPs (trihalomethanes [THMs], haloacetic acids [HAAs], halonitromethanes [HNMs], haloacetonitriles [HANs], and nitrosamines) in indoor swimming pools operational conditions in the U.S.. The results showed that the DBPs in the investigated 23 swimming pools were far higher than the drinking water regulation values in the U.S. Average THMs, HAAs, HANs, HNMs, and N-nitrosodimethylamine concentrations were 80 mu g/L, 1541 mu g/L, 19 mu g/L, 5.4 mu g/L, and 27 ng/L, respectively. An increase in organic matter released by the swimmers and bromide (from the filling water or electrochemical generation of chlorine) levels in the water increased the overall formation of DBPs. Increases in free available chlorine, pH, and water temperature were shown to enhance the formation of THMs and HAAs. These favorable conditions lead to rapid formation (i.e. 3-6 hours) of THMs and HAAs under swimming pool conditions.

Increasing evidence exhibits the relevance of aquaporins to tolerance against abiotic and biotic stresses such as drought, nutrient deficiency, and herbivore attack. With the accumulation of crop genome sequencing, it is suggested that several aquaporin genes are conserved in subchromosomal locations as tandem duplicated members. In this review, we will discuss the compelling nature of aquaporins as multifunctional transport channels that are often encoded in clustered regions of genomes and relevant to stress resistance in plants.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1300-008X	1303-6106		WOS:000365331800002

Mergers that occur throughout the crisis appear to be more significant events for both targets and acquirers. Acquirers seek out relatively larger targets during the crisis and offer premiums are higher than pre-crisis values. Valuation discrepancies between targets and acquirers are also greater for crisis period mergers, suggesting that merger gains outweigh presumably high capital reallocation costs. Acquirers have lower capital ratios than their peers during the crisis, indicating that they may use mergers defensively as recapitalization events. However, crisis period mergers do not appear to be motivated by asset-based liquidity concerns for either the target or acquirer. Examining how firm characteristics relate to value creation, we find targets that are undervalued relative to their acquirers see larger offer premiums during the crisis, but not before. Targets with poorer-performing loan portfolios, however, observe lower offer premiums during the crisis. Lastly, we find overall merger announcement value creation during the financial crisis is greater when targets have higher quality assets, are better capitalized, and are less efficient.

LIQUID LIGNIN FROM THE SLRP (TM) PROCESS: THE EFFECT OF PROCESSING CONDITIONS AND BLACK-LIQUOR PROPERTIES								JOURNAL OF WOOD CHEMISTRY AND TECHNOLOGY				36	1			27	41		10.1080/02773813.2015.1039545			2015	2015	CO2 acidification of Kraft black liquors was performed at temperatures of 100-150 degrees C and pressures of 5-8 bar in an investigation of the SLRP (TM) process. At these conditions, a highly hydrated, lignin-rich liquid (vs. the usual solid) separated out to form a new phase. The solids content/ionic strength of the starting black liquor was found to be a key variable for controlling the bulk and molecular properties of the "liquid-lignin" (LL) phase. For example, black liquors of lower ionic strengths (20% solids) produced LLs with lower ash contents and higher molecular weights, albeit in lower yields. In contrast, higher ionic strengths/solids content (40%) produced LLs in higher yields with higher aromatic and aliphatic hydroxyl contents. Temperature effects were significant only at the highest levels. The degree of hydration of the LL phase was found to be a useful measure of the water available for hydration of ionized/polarizable groups in lignin.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0277-3813	1532-2319		WOS:000364850100004

Understanding the details of these interactions is important for designing dendrimers with tunable association with guest molecules. In this work, we investigate dendrimer interactions with small aromatic hydrocarbons using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. We study the association of naphthalene (NPH)-the smallest polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-with 3rd-6th generation (G3-G6) polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers. Our work emphasizes that the association of small aromatic molecules with PAMAM dendrimers involves the formation of dynamic pocket-like association sites through interactions between flexible dendrimer branches and NPH molecules. The association sites are primarily formed by branches from the two outermost dendrimer subgenerations, and often involve the tertiary amine groups. Irrespective of their location on the dendrimer-whether buried or near the outer surface-these pocket-like structures lower the hydration of the associated NPH molecules. We show that on average NPH molecules with a lower hydration have a greater tendency to remain associated with the dendrimer for longer times. In general, the association sites are similar for the G3-G6 PAMAM dendrimers, indicating similarities in the association mechanisms across different dendrimer generations.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000364639700014	26395843

Water activities were created in sealed containers using saturated salt solutions and placed in temperature-controlled incubators. Soy/PE fibers that were held at 0.823 a(w) or higher exhibited mold growth at all temperatures. As postulated, increased water activity (greater than 0.89) and temperature (higher than 25 degrees C) accelerated mold growth on soy/PE fibers. A slower mold growth was observed on soy/PE fibers that were held at 0.87 a(w) and 10 degrees C. A Weibull model was employed to fit the observed logarithmic values of T, a(w), and an interaction term log T x log a(w) and was chosen as the final model as it gave the best fit to the raw mold growth data. These growth models predict the expected mold-free storage period of soy/PE fibers when exposed to various environmental temperatures and humidities.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1687-9422	1687-9430		WOS:000364859800001

Polycarbonate membranes with pore sizes of 1.2 and 3.0 mu m were coated with different PPEI-EI-MWNTs and cross-linked PPEI-EI-MWNTs samples at various coating densities, and then evaluated for capturing of E. coli cells at flow rates of 0.25 and 0.5 mL min(-1). With a good combination of PPEI-EI-MWNTs sample, coating density, appropriate filter pore size and flow rate, a capture efficiency of higher than 4 log (up to 6 log or larger) of bacterial cells was achieved. The filters coated with the cross-linked PPEI-EI-MWNTs were unexpectedly less efficient than those with the other PPEI-EI-MWNTs samples, likely due to the poorer dispersibility of the cross-linked sample and consequently the less homogeneous coating on filters. The results of this study demonstrated the feasibility of PPEI-EI-MWNTs as a coating material on filters for highly effective capturing of bacterial pathogens, and also presented both challenges and opportunities for further investigations in controlling the coating material synthesis to improve performance in capturing bacterial cells.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2046-2069			WOS:000364057000021

This study addressed a strategic multistage expansion (e.g., a decade) of a cellulosic biofuel supply chain system with supplements of corn grain biofuels. A multiobjective, multiyear optimization framework was proposed, and the compromise method was used to seek best-compromise solutions between economic competitiveness and environmental quality of the supply chain while satisfying evolving fuel demand, feedstock resources, and technological constraints. The model was implemented in an illustrative case study of planning an in-state ethanol supply chain in California between 2015 and 2025. The results indicated that significant trade-offs existed between cost and greenhouse gas emissions in the supply chain and that cellulosic ethanol produced from corn stover and forest residues could be an important alternative to corn ethanol with a low cost of $2.20/gal and emissions of 1.5 carbon dioxide equivalent kg/gal.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0361-1981	2169-4052		WOS:000364618200012

Monographs of the Western North American Naturalist				7	1			276	296					Jan 2015	2015	California's 8 Channel Islands host a large diversity of insects, the vast majority of which are shared with mainland southern California. The existence of a small number of recognized endemic species, however, suggest that, for some lineages, the islands are isolated enough to have permitted significant differentiation. Here we investigate the phylogeographic relationships of 4 beetle species (Thinopinus pictus, Hadrotes crassus, Hypocaccus lucidulus, and Nyctoporis carinata): all occurring on the mainland and on multiple (up to 6) Channel Islands. Sequences of the cytochrome oxidase I mitochondrial gene (and, for one species, an intron in the nuclear guftagu gene) are analyzed by Bayesian, haplotype network, and population genetic methods to examine relationships and gene flow among island and mainland populations. In no instances were all island populations resolved to be monophyletic, and northern (Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, San Miguel) and southern (San Nicolas, San Clemente, Santa Catalina) island groups generally showed separate relationships to the mainland. Northern island populations of Hy. lucidulus were also found to be closely related to those on the southern island of San Nicolas. Populations on San Clemente and Santa Catalina islands did not show close relationships to each other or to San Nicolas Island populations in any species. San Clemente and especially San Nicolas islands hosted disproportionately high levels of diversity in all species examined. This study suggests that the Channel Islands do not function as a biogeographical unit and that several of the islands exhibit levels of diversity comparable to, or even exceeding, similarly sampled populations on the mainland. Thus, as an insular refuge from southern Californian development, the Channel Islands constitute a center of high conservation importance.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1545-0228			ZOOREC:ZOOR15112086276

J	Pallipuram, Vivek K.; Smith, Melissa C.; Sarma, Nilim; Anand, Ranajeet; Weill, Edwin; Sapra, Karan								Subjective versus objective: classifying analytical models for productive heterogeneous performance prediction								JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING				71	1			162	201		10.1007/s11227-014-1292-9			JAN 2015	2015	Heterogeneous analytical models are valuable tools that facilitate optimal application tuning via runtime prediction; however, they require several man-hours of effort to understand and employ for meaningful performance prediction. Consequently, developers face the challenge of selecting adequate performance models that best fit their design goals and level of system knowledge. In this research, we present a classification that enables users to select a set of easy-to-use and reliable analytical models for quality performance prediction. These models, which target the general-purpose graphical processing unit (GPGPU)-based systems, are categorized into two primary analytical classes: subjective-analytical and objective-analytical. The subjective-analytical models predict the computation and communication components of an application by describing the system using minimum qualitative relations among the system parameters; whereas the objective-analytical models predict these components by measuring pertinent hardware events using micro-benchmarks. We categorize, enhance, and characterize the existing analytical models for GPGPU computations, network-level, and inter-connect communications to facilitate fast and reliable application performance prediction. We also explore a suitable combination of the aforementioned analytical classes, the hybrid approach, for high-quality performance prediction and report prediction accuracy up to 95 % for several tested GPGPU cluster configurations. The research aims to ultimately provide a collection of easy-to-select analytical models that promote straightforward and accurate performance prediction prior to large-scale implementation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0920-8542	1573-0484		WOS:000347701000008

Impact of Silver and Iron Nanoparticle Exposure on Cholesterol Uptake by Macrophages								JOURNAL OF NANOMATERIALS										127235	10.1155/2015/127235			2015	2015	Macrophages are central to the development of atherosclerosis by absorbing lipids, promoting inflammation, and increasing plaque deposition. Nanoparticles (NPs) are becoming increasingly common in biomedical applications thereby increasing exposure to the immune and vascular systems. This project investigated the influence of NPs on macrophage function and specifically cholesterol uptake. Macrophages were exposed to 20nm silver NPs (AgNPs), 110nm AgNPs, or 20nm Fe3O4 NPs for 2 h and NP uptake, cytotoxicity, and subsequent uptake of fluorescently labeled cholesterol were assessed. Macrophage uptake of NPs did not induce cytotoxicity at concentrations utilized (25 mu g/mL); however, macrophage exposure to 20nm AgNPs reduced subsequent uptake of cholesterol. Further, we assessed the impact of a cholesterol-rich environment on macrophage function following NP exposure. In these sets of experiments, macrophages internalized NPs, exhibited no cytotoxicity, and altered cholesterol uptake. Alterations in the expression of scavenger receptor-B1 following NP exposure, which likely influences cholesterol uptake, were observed. Overall, NPs alter cholesterol uptake, which may have implications in the progression of vascular or immune mediated diseases. Therefore, for the safe development of NPs for biomedical applications, it is necessary to understand their impact on cellular function and biological interactions in underlying disease environments.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1687-4110	1687-4129		WOS:000364133100001

This is a retrospective review of 137 patients with 154 consecutive primary constrained THAs performed between November 2003 and August 2007. We reviewed serial radiographs, postoperative complications, groin/thigh pain, and compared preoperative and postoperative Harris Hip Scores. With a mean follow-up of 6 years. there was 1.9% dislocation rate, 0% component failure rate, and 2.6% infection rate. Seven patients reported continued groin pain, and three had continued thigh pain. One patient showed radiographic evidence of 1 mm polyethylene wear. Radiographic review showed no evidence of osteolysis or stem subsidence. Harris Hip Scores improved from a mean of 68.8 (range 58-87) preoperatively to 98.9 (range 65-100) at final clinical assessment. This constrained acetabular prosthesis had a dislocation rate of less than 2%, with 0% component failure rate at a minimum of 2 years of follow-up suggesting this prosthesis may be a viable alternative for patients at risk for instability or those known to have recurrent instability.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2035-8237	2035-8164		WOS:000363785300004

Snurr, Randall/B-6699-2009				A modelling approach for MOF-encapsulated metal catalysts and application to n-butane oxidation								PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS				17	41			27596	27608		10.1039/c5cp04705f			2015	2015	Metal nanoparticles (NP) encapsulated by metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are novel composite materials that have shown promise as regioselective catalysts. The regioselectivity in these materials arises from steric constraints imposed by the porous MOF structure, which limit the way molecules approach and interact with the metal surface. Here we introduce a conceptually simple DFT approach to model reactions under such steric constraints. This approach is computationally efficient and accounts for the steric constraints imposed by a MOF pore in a general way. The adsorption of reactants, intermediates, and products associated with oxidation of n-butane to 1-butanol (and 2-butanol) on clean and oxygen-covered palladium surfaces is investigated with (and without) the constraints of a pore. Reaction energies are calculated, and we find that the thermodynamic favorability of the intermediate reactions is affected by the presence of steric constraints, oxygen coverage, and the exposed crystal surface of the metal. Based on these results, the Pd(111) surface with 0.25 ML oxygen coverage and steric constraints (which could be provided by a suitable MOF) seems promising to favor the desired sequence of reactions that would lead to the conversion of n-butane to 1-butanol.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000363193800039	26426485

J	Gao, Shuhong; Volny, Frank; Wang, Mingsheng								A NEW FRAMEWORK FOR COMPUTING GROBNER BASES								MATHEMATICS OF COMPUTATION				85	297			449	465		10.1090/mcom/2969			JAN 2015	2015	This paper presents a new framework for computing Grobner bases for ideals and syzygy modules. It is proposed to work in a module that accommodates any given ideal and the corresponding syzygy module (for the given generators of the ideal). A strong Grobner basis for this module contains Grobner bases for both the ideal and the syzygy module. The main result is a simple characterization of strong Grobner bases. This characterization can detect useless S-polynomials without reductions, thus yields an efficient algorithm. It also explains all the rewritten rules used in F5 and the recent papers in the literature. Rigorous proofs are given for the correctness and finite termination of the algorithm. For any term order for an ideal, one may vary signature orders (i.e. the term orders for the syzygy module). It is shown by computer experiments on benchmark examples that signature orders based on weighted terms are much better than other signature orders. This is useful for practical computation. Also, since computing Gobner bases for syzygies is a main computational task for free resolutions in commutative algebra, the algorithm of this paper should be useful for computing free resolutions in practice.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0025-5718	1088-6842		WOS:000362848100017

Under the lens of evolutionary psychology we argue that individuals deemed capable of contributing to social and organizational goals become valued group members while those who threaten group stability and viability risk being shunned or ostracized. Specifically, we review empirical evidence and present the results of a pilot study suggesting that those who are perceived to violate injunctive and descriptive norms, as well as threaten one's self-concept are at increased risk for ostracism. In terms of intervention, we propose mindfulness techniques and organizational support as a route to deter employees' inclinations to ostracize coworkers. Thus, a primary goal of this chapter is to explicate a framework for identifying the predictors and deterrents of workplace ostracism in order to generate additional research on this important topic.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1479-3555		978-1-78560-116-3; 978-1-78560-117-0	WOS:000361324700006

Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM				2015				125969	125969		10.1155/2015/125969			2015	2015	Inpatient medical rehabilitation has maintained a typical medical-model focus and structure for many years. However, as integrative therapies, such as yoga therapy, emerge as treatments which can enhance the physical and mental health of its participants, it is important to determine if they can be easily implemented into the traditional rehabilitation structure and milieu. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the perceptions of key agency personnel on the feasibility and utility of yoga therapy implemented in inpatient rehabilitation. This study reports the results of focus groups and an individual interview with key stakeholders (administrators and rehabilitation therapists) from two rehabilitation hospitals following the implementation of yoga therapy. Results focused on several key themes: feasibility from the therapist and administrator perspectives, challenges to implementation, and utility and benefit. Overall, the implementation and integration of yoga therapy were positive; however, some programmatic and policy and organizational considerations remain.

Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE					102			e52869	e52869		10.3791/52869			2015 Aug 15	2015	We demonstrate a novel synthesis strategy for the preparation of Pr-doped SrTiO3 ceramics via a combination of solid state reaction and spark plasma sintering techniques. Polycrystalline ceramics possessing a unique morphology can be achieved by optimizing the process parameters, particularly spark plasma sintering heating rate. The phase and morphology of the synthesized ceramics were investigated in detail using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microcopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. It was observed that the grains of these bulk Pr-doped SrTiO3 ceramics were enhanced with Pr-rich grain boundaries. Electronic and thermal transport properties were also investigated as a function of temperature and doping concentration. Such a microstructure was found to give rise to improved thermoelectric properties. Specifically, it resulted in a significant improvement in carrier mobility and the thermoelectric power factor. Simultaneously, it also led to a marked reduction in the thermal conductivity. As a result, a significant improvement (> 30%) in the thermoelectric figure of merit was achieved for the whole temperature range over all previously reported maximum values for SrTiO3-based ceramics. This synthesis demonstrates the steps for the preparation of bulk polycrystalline ceramics of non-uniformly Pr-doped SrTiO3.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1940-087X		MEDLINE:26327483	26327483

Its wide spectrum attracts various people from gender, race, ethnicity, cultures, religion, and sexuality. Black male student-athletes, a target of higher education institutions, are affected by sociological, institutional, and athletic factors. This population is highly sought after by college coaches due to their athletic abilities and ability skills in their specific sport in order to elevate their respective sports team, athletics' department, and university into the national limelight. Current institutional and intercollegiate athletics' trends that are incorporated to recruit Black male student-athletes are explored. Specific recruiting techniques utilized by college coaches to persuade this population are examined. The sociological issues in current intercollegiate athletics are analyzed with their direct effect on the college selection choice of Black male student-athletes.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1479-3644		978-1-78441-393-4; 978-1-78441-394-1	WOS:000360879900004

In particular, a user who stores encrypted data on a remote untrusted server forms queries that enable the server to efficiently locate the records containing the requested keywords, even though the user may misspell keywords or provide noisy data in the query. We define an appropriate primitive, for a general closeness function on the message space, that we call efficiently fuzzy-searchable encryption (EFSE). Next we identify an optimal security notion for EFSE. We demonstrate that existing schemes do not meet our security definition and propose a new scheme that we prove secure under basic assumptions. Unfortunately, the scheme requires large ciphertext length, but we show that, in a sense, this space-inefficiency is unavoidable for a general, optimally-secure scheme. Seeking the right balance between efficiency and security, we then show how to construct schemes that are more efficient and satisfy a weaker security notion that we propose. To illustrate, we present and analyze a more space-efficient scheme for supporting fuzzy search on biometric data that achieves the weaker notion.					21st International Workshop on Fast Software Encryption (FSE)21st International Workshop on Fast Software Encryption (FSE)	MAR 03-05, 2014MAR 03-05, 2014	CESG; KPMG; NXP; Visa Europe; Int Assoc Cryptol ResCESG; KPMG; NXP; Visa Europe; Int Assoc Cryptol Res	Londons Nat Hist Museum, London, ENGLANDLondons Nat Hist Museum, London, ENGLAND	2	0	0	0	0	2			0302-9743		978-3-662-46706-0; 978-3-662-46705-3	WOS:000362512500031

A hyperspectral and toxicological analysis of protein corona impact on silver nanoparticle properties, intracellular modifications, and macrophage activation								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NANOMEDICINE				10				6509	6521		10.2147/IJN.S92570			2015	2015	The inevitable adsorption of biomolecules on nanomaterials results in the formation of a protein corona (PC), which modifies the nanoparticle (NP)-cell interface resulting in modified uptake, activity, clearance, and toxicity. While the physicochemical properties of the NP govern the composition of PC, the formation of PC in turn alters the characteristics of the NP by imparting a new unique "biological" identity. To assess how the PC influences AgNP properties, intracellular modifications, and cellular responses, we utilized a combination of hyperspectral and toxicological analyses. AgNPs were coated with a complex PC (multiple proteins, eg, 10% fetal bovine serum) or a simple PC (single protein, eg, bovine serum albumin [BSA]) and evaluated by hyperspectral and dynamic light scattering for modifications in AgNP properties. Mouse macrophages were exposed to AgNPs with PCs and examined for differences in uptake, cytotoxicity, and cell activation. Hyperspectral imaging revealed intracellular modifications to AgNPs that were found to spectrally match alterations in AgNPs following incubation in lysosomal fluid. Addition of the PC influenced AgNP uptake and cytotoxicity; however, hydrodynamic size and surface charge did not contribute to these responses. Assessments of all endpoints demonstrated differences between complex and BSA PC, suggesting that these responses are not purely driven by the primary protein component of the complex PC (ie, BSA). Alterations in cellular-NP uptake/interactions may be driven through cell surface receptor recognition of protein constituents that make up the PC rather than the physicochemical differences in AgNPs.									7	0	1	5	0	8			1178-2013			WOS:000362678700001	26508856

Understanding contextual influences of community reintegration among injured servicemembers								JOURNAL OF REHABILITATION RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT				52	5			527	541		10.1682/JRRD.2014.08.0196			2015	2015	As part of a larger mixed-methods research project investigating the influence of contextual factors on community reintegration (CR), this qualitative study sought to understand the subjective experiences of injured servicemembers and their perception of how contextual factors influenced their CR. More specifically, this article addresses how the influences of contextual factors differ between injured servicemembers with different levels of CR. Using a phenomenological framework, semistructured interviews were conducted with nine injured, community-dwelling servicemembers with low, moderate, and high levels of CR (three per category). Participants provided in-depth descriptions of the contextual barriers and facilitators of CR. Thematic analysis indicated the importance of social support and personal factors (e.g., self-efficacy, personal motivation) as the primary means for being reintegrated into their homes and communities. Other themes indicated factors that had an indirect but important influence on CR, including adapted sports, recreation, and other social programs; rehabilitation programs and therapists; school, work, and volunteering; and organizations and policies in developing social supports and personal factors. Comparisons between servicemembers indicated that participants with low CR described many more contextual barriers and far fewer contextual facilitators to reintegration than those with high CR. Those with moderate CR were unique in that they described many facilitators and barriers to reintegration.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0748-7711	1938-1352		WOS:000362623000003	26436882

In this article, we probed the influence of defect-induced hydrophilicity on the biocorona formation using micro-Raman, photoluminescence, infrared spectroscopy, electrochemistry, and molecular dynamics simulations. Our results show that the interaction of proteins (albumin and fibrinogen) with CNMs is strongly influenced by charge-transfer between them, inducing protein unfolding which enhances conformational entropy and higher protein adsorption.									2	0	0	1	0	2			2046-2069			WOS:000362437900072	26877870

The application provided a virtual meeting space and through the use of video pods the teacher and coach had synchronous audio and video communication. Each coaching session lasted approximately one hour and included a pre-observation discussion, an observation of a 30-minute individualized lesson with a struggling reader, and a debriefing conversation. Data, including transcriptions of the coaching sessions, interviews with participants, field notes, and journal entries were analyzed using the constant-comparative method.Findings - Findings showed the ability to link teachers and coaches in a virtual space creates new possibilities for engaging in reflective practice that certainly are not trouble-free, but do provide opportunities to think deeply about teaching and learning without being face-to-face.Practical implications - As school districts continue to experience budgetary cuts, it is important to explore alternative ways to support teachers. The findings identified in this study underscore the differences between face-to-face and virtual coaching. Understanding and accepting the limitations of the technology and recognizing the importance of the teacher/coach relationship could provide a starting point for school districts interested in computer-mediated communication.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2048-0458		978-1-78441-675-1; 978-1-78441-676-8	WOS:000360883900017

We give conditions for when two update sequences pi, pi' give cycle equivalent maps F-pi, F-pi', and we give improved upper bounds for the number of distinct cycle equivalence classes that can be generated by varying the update sequence.

Frontiers in neuroscience				9				325	325		10.3389/fnins.2015.00325			2015	2015	Funding institutions and researchers increasingly expect that data will be shared to increase scientific integrity and provide other scientists with the opportunity to use the data with novel methods that may advance understanding in a particular field of study. In practice, sharing human subject data can be complicated because data must be de-identified prior to sharing. Moreover, integrating varied data types collected in a study can be challenging and time consuming. For example, sharing data from structural imaging studies of a complex disorder requires the integration of imaging, demographic and/or behavioral data in a way that no subject identifiers are included in the de-identified dataset and with new subject labels or identification values that cannot be tracked back to the original ones. We have developed a Java program that users can use to remove identifying information in neuroimaging datasets, while still maintaining the association among different data types from the same subject for further studies. This software provides a series of user interaction wizards to allow users to select data variables to be de-identified, implements functions for auditing and validation of de-identified data, and enables the user to share the de-identified data in a single compressed package through various communication protocols, such as FTPS and SFTP. DeID runs with Windows, Linux, and Mac operating systems and its open architecture allows it to be easily adapted to support a broader array of data types, with the goal of facilitating data sharing.

However, there were two significant departures from the results of Kohlmeyer et al. (2011). AACSB accreditation did help mitigate the respondents' reluctance to hire students with OL degrees. In addition, nonpublic accounting professionals were neutral as to whether they would hire someone with an online accounting degree in the next three years. Public accounting professionals opposed hiring someone with an online accounting degree in the next three years (Kohlmeyer et al., 2011).Practical implications - Online programs are going to have to be more proactive in persuading accounting professionals that an online and FTF accounting degree are equally desirable for hiring purposes.Social implications - Students need to be aware of accounting professionals' hiring concerns in regard to candidates with online accounting degrees.Originality/value - Little research has examined the hiring preferences of accounting professionals in selecting candidates with either an online or FTF accounting degree.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1085-4622		978-1-78441-645-4; 978-1-78441-646-1	WOS:000359478800004

Dinuclear copper(I) complexes with N-heterocyclic thione and selone ligands: synthesis, characterization, and electrochemical studies								DALTON TRANSACTIONS				44	37			16313	16324		10.1039/c5dt02232k			2015	2015	The synthesis, characterization, and structures of a series of homoleptic and heteroleptic copper(I) complexes supported by N-heterocyclic chalcogenone ligands is reported herein. The quasi-reversible Cu(II/I) reduction potentials of these copper complexes with monodentate (dmit or dmise) and/or bidentate (Bmm(Me), Bsem(Me), Bme(Me), Bsee(Me)) chalcogenone ligands are highly dependent upon the nature and number of the donor groups and can be tuned over a 470 mV range (-369 to 102 mV). Copper-selone complexes have more negative Cu(II/I) reduction potentials relative to their thione analogs by an average of 137 mV, and increasing the number of methylene units linking the heterocyclic rings in the bidentate ligands results in more negative reduction potentials for their copper complexes. This ability to tune the copper reduction potentials over a wide range has potential applications in synthetic and industrial catalysis as well as the understanding of important biological processes such as electron transfer in blue copper proteins and respiration.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000361544500016	26300277

In this study, we demonstrate directional emission from fluorophores on flexible Ag-C-60 SPCE sensor platforms for point-of-care sensing, in healthcare and forensic sensing scenarios, with at least 10 times higher sensitivity than traditional fluorescence sensing schemes. Adopting the highly sensitive Ag-C-60 SPCE platform based on glass and novel low-cost flexible substrates, we report the unambiguous detection of acid-fast Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) bacteria at densities as low as 20 Mtb mm(-2); from non-acid-fast bacteria (e.g., E. coli and S. aureus), and the specific on-site detection of acid-fast sperm cells in human semen samples. In combination with the directional emission and high-sensitivity of SPCE platforms, we also demonstrate the utility of smartphones that can replace expensive and cumbersome detectors to enable rapid hand-held detection of analytes in resource-limited settings; a much needed critical advance to biosensors, for developing countries.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000361697400053	26345678

When assessing stability of slopes in the face of uncertainties, it is desirable, and sometimes necessary, to adopt reliability-based approaches that consider these uncertainties explicitly. This paper focuses on the practical procedures developed recently for the reliability-based assessment of slope stability. The statistical characterization of model uncertainty and parameter uncertainty are first described, followed by an evaluation of the failure probability of a slope corresponding to a single slip surface, and the system failure probability. The availability of site-specific information then makes it possible to update the reliability of the slope through the Bayes' theorem. Furthermore, how to perform reliability-based design when the statistics of random variables cannot be determined accurately is also discussed. Finally, case studies are presented to illustrate the benefit of performing reliability-based design and the procedure for conducting reliability-based robust design when the statistics of the random variables are incomplete.

J	Arunachalam, Harikesh; Onori, Simona; Battiato, Ilenia								On Veracity of Macroscopic Lithium-Ion Battery Models								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				162	10			A1940	A1951		10.1149/2.0771509jes			2015	2015	Batteries are electrochemical energy storage devices that exhibit physico-chemical heterogeneity on a continuity of scales. As such, battery systems are amenable to mathematical descriptions on a multiplicity of scales that range from atomic to continuum. In this paper we present a new method to assess the veracity of macroscopic models of lithium-ion batteries. Macroscopic models treat the electrode as a continuum and are often employed to describe the mass and charge transfer of lithium since they are computational tractable and practical to model the system at the cell scale. Yet, they rely on a number of simplifications and assumptions that may be violated under given operating conditions. We use multiple-scale expansions to upscale the pore-scale Poisson-Nerst-Planck (PNP) equations and establish sufficient conditions under which macroscopic dual-continua mass and charge transport equations accurately represent pore-scale dynamics. We propose a new method to quantify the relative importance of three key pore-scale transport mechanisms (electromigration, diffusion and heterogenous reaction) by means of the electric Peclet (Pe) and Damkohler (Da) numbers in the electrolyte and the electrode phases. For the first time, applicability conditions of macroscopic models through a phase diagram in the (Da-Pe)-space are defined. Finally, we discuss how the new proposed tool can be used to assess the validity of macroscopic models across different battery chemistry and conditions of operation. In particular, a case study analysis is presented using commercial lithium-ion batteries that investigates the validity of Newman-type macroscopic models under temperature and current rate of charge/discharge variation.

J	Mayerl, Christopher; Baeckens, Simon; Van Damme, Raoul								Evolution and role of the follicular epidermal gland system in non-ophidian squamates								AMPHIBIA-REPTILIA				36	3			185	206		10.1163/15685381-00002995			2015	2015	Many lizard and amphisbaenian lineages possess follicular glands in the dermis of the inner thighs and/or the area anterior to the cloaca. These tubular glands produce a holocrine secretion that finds its way to the external world through pore-bearing scales (femoral and/or preanal pores). Secretions are composed of proteins and many lipophilic compounds that may function as chemosignals in lizard and amphisbaenian communication. In recent years, we have begun to develop an understanding of the adaptive significance of these secretions, and they are currently thought to play an important role in a variety of processes in these animals. While it appears that epidermal gland secretions function in intra- and interspecific recognition and territoriality, research has focused largely on their role in mate assessment. Despite these recent studies, our knowledge on the true role of the chemicals found in epidermal secretions remains poorly studied, and there are many possible avenues for future research on this topic. Here, we review the literature on the follicular epidermal glands of non-ophidian squamates and provide a first taxon-wide overview of their distribution.									5	0	0	3	0	5			0173-5373	1568-5381		WOS:000360976600001

Targeting oncogenic miRNAs with small molecules is currently being explored to develop cancer therapeutics. Here, we report the development of dual binding neomycin-bisbenzimidazole conjugates that target oncogenic miR-27a with high affinity (K-a = 1.2 to 7.4 x 10(8) M-1). These conjugates bring significant reduction (similar to 65% at 5 mu M) in mature miRNA levels and penetrate easily in the cells where they localise both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Cell cycle analysis showed significant increase in the G0/G1 phase (similar to 15%) and decrease in the S phase (similar to 7%) upon treatment with neomycin-bisbenzimidazole conjugates, suggesting inhibition of cell proliferation. Using the conjugation approach, we show that moderately binding ligands can be covalently combined into high affinity binders. This study also highlights the role of linker optimization in designing high affinity ligands for miR-27a targeting.									6	0	0	4	0	6			2041-6520	2041-6539		WOS:000361212000060

Resistance in Alternaria alternata to SDHI Fungicides Causes Rare Disease Outbreak in Peach Orchards								PLANT DISEASE				99	1			65	70		10.1094/PDIS-04-14-0387-RE			JAN 2015	2015	Alternaria rot, caused by Alternaria alternata, was observed in commercial peach orchards in South Carolina. Single-spore isolates formed two phenotypically different culture morphologies on two artificial media. Isolates highly resistant (HR) to boscalid were also HR to penthiopyrad. Among isolates HR and medium resistant (MR) to boscalid and penthiopyrad, we detected isolates that were MR to fluopyram and HR to fluxapyroxad. Sequence analysis of succinate dehydrogenase (sdh) genes sdhB, sdhC, and sdhD revealed that resistant phenotypes were associated with point mutations leading to amino acid substitutions. In particular, H277Y/R in the SDHB and H134R in SDHC were consistently associated with the boscalid HR phenotype. The highest effective concentration that inhibits growth by 50% (EC50) values to penthiopyrad were conferred by H134R and D123E, whereas H134R conferred low resistance and MR to fluxapyroxad. A previously undescribed mutation, G79R, was identified in our collection conferring HR to both boscalid and penthiopyrad. The point mutations associated with highest EC50 values to all four FRAC 7 fungicides were H277L and H134R. The outbreak of Alternaria rot demonstrates that fungicide programs containing "medium to high-risk fungicides" may promote disease outbreaks by secondary pathogens that typically are outcompeted or controlled effectively, while still controlling the primary target disease.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0191-2917	1943-7692		WOS:000360865300009

The solubility diagrams and Gibbs adsorption isotherms of the electropolishing products are thus very important to understand the thermodynamic mechanism of precipitation of reaction products. Electropolishing of tungsten wires in aqueous solutions of potassium hydroxide is used as an example illustrating the different thermodynamic scenarios of electropolishing. Electropolishing products are able to form highly viscous films immiscible with the surrounding electrolyte or porous shells adhered to the wire surface. Using X-ray nanotomography, we discovered a gel-like phase formed at the tungsten surface during electropolishing. The results of these studies suggest that the electropolishing products can form a rich library of compounds. The surface tension of the electrolyte depends on the metal oxide ions and alkali-metal complexes.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000360448300078	26279498

ACTA SCIENTIARUM-TECHNOLOGY				37	3			379	387		10.4025/actascitechnol.v37i3.26531			2015	2015	Small and medium sized manufacturing companies are important both to economic growth and to supply chains. Yet only limited research has focused on this type of organization - this includes in the area of manufacturing strategy. Using a large scale survey of 149 firms across three States in Brazil, this paper examines the competitive capabilities of small and medium sized manufacturing companies; and the link between their capabilities and performance. Our results show that the best-performing firms are those that lead on capabilities like quality and innovativeness rather than on cost. Much of the available literature on manufacturing strategy emphasizes only four key competitive priorities: cost, flexibility, quality and delivery. Consequently, our results confirm innovativeness as an important, fifth capability for small and medium sized firms in Brazil to maintain or develop. The findings are of relevance both to small and medium sized manufacturing companies in emerging economies and to international firms looking to relocate or outsource to Brazil.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1806-2563	1807-8664		WOS:000360381000009

Massey (1934-2013) devoted his attention to spread-spectrum communications very infrequently and then only for brief periods of time. In a short summer study for NASA in 1969, his research in sub-baud coding theory produced several concepts and techniques that are very important in the analysis and design of sequences for certain applications of direct-sequence spread spectrum. Massey never published his work on sub-baud coding theory in a journal, and his contributions went unnoticed until several years later when he presented some of his findings at the Allerton Conference. We provide a tutorial survey of Massey's concepts, tools, and sequence optimization criteria that have been employed by other researchers for the past four decades. Extensions of Massey's sequence-optimization concepts to other performance criteria are reviewed.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1553-877X			WOS:000360315700014

Integration of large PV power into the grid operation introduces several challenges. Uncertainty of PV power generation causes frequency fluctuations and power system instabilities. Due to this, short term PV power prediction has become an important area of study. Short term PV power prediction supports proper decision-making in control centers. Power generation output of a PV plant is highly dependent on different weather conditions such as solar irradiance, temperature and cloud covers. Weather data analysis and prediction can be considered as big data due to its complexity and dynamically changing characteristics. In this paper, an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is developed and compared with an echo state network (ESN) for short term PV power prediction. The ANFIS approach consists of three ANFIS modules for predicting solar irradiance and temperature, and then estimating the PV power, respectively. The ESN on the other hand predicts the PV power based on current weather parameters. A weather database containing data sampled every second is used in developing the ANFIS and ESN based PV power prediction systems. Results are compared under different Clemson, SC weather conditions with the two approaches.

J	Martin, Julie P.								The Invisible Hand of Social Capital: Narratives of First Generation College Students in Engineering								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION				31	5			1170	1181					2015	2015	First generation college students can increase both the number and diversity of students in engineering. We use Lin's Network Theory of Social Capital, which describes relationships as being embedded with resources used to achieve a goal, as a framework for understanding undergraduate students' decisions to enroll in engineering studies. While much of the discourse on social capital in higher education focuses on inequalities and deficits experienced by first generation college students, our work helps to transition the discussion by highlighting the positive influence of education personnel as well as teachers and mentors associated with institutionalized programs. We use narrative analysis and two types of explicitly integrated complementary qualitative data to expand on Lin's theory. This paper presents an exemplar narrative describing what Lin calls the "invisible hand of social capital;" that is, when particularly resource-rich networks do not necessitate an individual knowingly mobilizing resources because information and resources are received in routine exchanges. Our findings support the need for continued proactive outreach, educational, and support systems that can serve as research-rich networks for first generation college students.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0949-149X			WOS:000360158800002

Assessment of metrics for resilient design of water distribution networks								JOURNAL OF WATER SUPPLY RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY-AQUA				64	6			660	669		10.2166/aqua.2015.014			2015	2015	Water distribution networks (WDNs) play a crucial role in the well-being of human populations and economic prosperity. It is essential that they cope with abnormal operating conditions and recover functionality quickly. Traditionally, WDNs are designed using cost and reliability objectives, but there is a lack of consensus on the definition and quantification of reliability which typically is a computationally intense process. Subsequently, various reliability-like metrics, called resilience indices, have been developed and demonstrated in the design of WDNs. Few studies exist that thoroughly evaluate the performance of the previously developed resilience metrics. This paper investigates three resilience metrics by evaluating their performance on three benchmark WDNs for several simulated mechanical failure states. The metrics studied are: (a) resilience index, (b) network resilience index (NRI), and (c) modified resilience index (MRI). The metric MRI performed better overall but NRI produced cheaper designs that performed better in the case of WDN-I. It is recommended that a better metric that incorporates different dimensions of resilience, such as robustness and redundancy, should be developed in the future.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0003-7214	1365-2087		WOS:000359347900002

Observation of electron biteout regions below sporadic E layers at polar latitudes								ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE				33	3			371	380		10.5194/angeo-33-371-2015			2015	2015	The descent of a narrow sporadic E layer near 95 km altitude over Poker Flat Research Range in Alaska was observed with electron probes on two consecutive sounding rockets and with incoherent scatter radar during a 2 h period near magnetic midnight. A series of four trimethyl aluminum chemical releases demonstrated that the Es layer remained just slightly above the zonal wind node, which was slowly descending due to propagating long-period gravity waves. The location of the layer is consistent with the equilibrium position due to combined action of the wind shear and electric fields. Although the horizontal electric field could not be measured directly, we estimate that it was similar to 2 mV m(-1) southward, consistent with modeling the vertical ion drift, and compatible with extremely quiet conditions. Both electron probes observed deep biteout regions just below the Es enhancements, which also descended with the sporadic layers. We discuss several possibilities for the cause of these depletions; one possibility is the presence of negatively charged, nanometer-sized mesospheric smoke particles. Such particles have recently been detected in the upper mesosphere, but not yet in immediate connection with sporadic E. Our observations of electron depletions suggest a new process associated with sporadic E.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0992-7689	1432-0576		WOS:000352159300013

The nanoparticles comprised organic ligands (acetylsalicylic acid, ASA, and 2-picolinic acid, PA) attached to the lanthanum trifluoride (LaF3) host crystals that were doped with optically active terbium III (Tb3+) and synthesized using solution-basedmethods. The ligands were employed to functionalize the surface of Tb3+:LaF3 nanocrystals to aid in dispersing the nanoparticles. In order to confirm the presence of the constituents within the inorganic-organic system, the nanoparticles were characterized by infrared spectroscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Absorption peaks observed from infrared spectroscopy for all the polymer nanocomposites loaded with organic surface treated nanocrystals exhibited peaks that were not present in undoped PMMA but were characteristic of the dopant and the ligand.									1	0	0	1	0	1			2314-4920	2314-4939		WOS:000359567100001

With the increase of Muslims in the USA, from both conversion and immigration, it is important to examine the effects of their religion on leisure and travel behavior.Design/methodology/approach - Using the grounded theory approach, semi-structured interviews with six Muslim men and six Muslim women of different nationalities were conducted in English in the local Mosque of Clemson, South Carolina, in the fall of 2011.Findings - The results provide some evidence that Islamic beliefs and behavioral practices influence leisure and travel behavior of Muslims in the USA. The study identifies seven major themes that play an important role in determining leisure and travel behavior of Muslims in Clemson. These are the importance of mosques, traveling with a Mohram, Hijab and a dress code for men and women, drinking alcohol and being in places where alcohol is served, eating pork, Holy Month of Ramadan and Dabiha.Practical implications - The study highlights the need for tourism marketers to pay more attention to the influence of religion on leisure and travel behavior of Muslim travelers.Originality/value - The study provides the tourism industry with a better understanding of the importance of religion influences on the special needs of Muslim travelers and shows how the industry can better accommodate these needs.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1750-6182	1750-6190		WOS:000359728500003

Characterizing Engineering Student Social Capital in Relation to Demographics								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION				31	4			914	926					2015	2015	The primary goal of this paper is to explore the relationships between engineering undergraduate student demographic characteristics and the social capital these students utilize when making academic and career decisions. This multi-institution study is carefully aligned with the Network Theory of Social Capital. Employing cluster analysis to characterize several key aspects of 1,410 undergraduate engineering students' social capital-namely, the composition and characterization of their social networks and indicators of their resource access-the authors explore latent patterns in the data, and uncover social capital profiles. These profiles are then related to demographic characteristics through additional statistical analyses. In particular, the paper investigates and challenges the theoretical notion regarding the significance of gender and race/ethnicity in students' social network characteristics and social capital indicators. Unlike other social capital work in education, this paper presents findings that gender and race/ethnicity are not significant or adequate for characterizing the social capital of engineering undergraduates.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0949-149X			WOS:000358934100002

The InSb nanoinclusions formed in situ at the grain boundaries of p-type FeSb2.2Te0.8 play multiple roles: the high carrier mobility of InSb mitigates the mobility degradation at the grain boundaries (in line with the "electron-channel''), while the added grain boundaries effectively scatter heat-carrying phonons (in line with "phonon-barrier''). As a result, the simultaneous carrier mobility enhancement and the lattice thermal conductivity reduction yield a high figure of merit ZT of similar to 0.76 at 800 K in the 3 mol% InSb-containing FeSb2.2Te0.8 sample, outperforming any other unfilled p-type skutterudites reported so far. The interplay between the p-type FeSb2.2Te0.8 host matrix and the n-type InSb nanoinclusions was analyzed in view of their respective electronic band structures and also in the context of an effective medium model. These results confirm not only the feasibility of fabricating p-type skutterudite nanocomposites, but also the great promise of FeSb2.2Te0.8 as the p-leg material in large-scale production of skutterudite-based thermoelectric modules.									8	0	0	0	0	8			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000359264800013

This paper focuses on results for local fields of characteristic p. In particular, we are able to produce analogous results to Jones and Roberts in the case that the characteristic does not divide the degree of the field extension. Also, in this case, following from the work of Pauli and Rob lot, we prove that the defining polynomials of these extensions can be written in a simple form amenable to computation. Finally, if p is the degree of the extension, we show there are infinitely many extensions of this degree and thus these cannot be classified in the same manner.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0035-7596	1945-3795		WOS:000359020200004		
J	Rivlin, Elizabeth								Service and Servants in Early Modern English Culture to 1660								JOURNAL OF EARLY MODERN STUDIES				4				17	41					2015	2015	This review essay surveys the last ten years of literary scholarship on service and servants in early modern England, with a particular focus on Shakespeare, to off er an overview of approaches and a sense of new directions in the field. The essay examines how studies have often pivoted between considering the act ('service') and the person ('servant') who performs it. Definitional ambiguities seem permanently to hover around these key terms. But rather than portending incoherence, the continuing presence of multiple definitions signals that scholarship about service and servants has reached a certain maturity. In the period under review, the field has matured to the point that critics no longer need to prove that service deserves consideration as an object of study, with the result that they can pursue vigorously the ways in which service and servants are imbricated with larger ontological and phenomenological questions. Investigating recent criticism on service takes this essay into critical territory that encompasses not only social class, economics, occupational identity, and subjectivity, but also aesthetics, ethics, affect, gender and sexuality, politics, race and colonialism. One important conclusion is that a growing body of work, some of it tracing the development of inter-Atlantic slavery from paradigms of service, offers a material, historical perspective on the ways in which servants enable freedom for others without being enabled to experience it for themselves. Looking to the future, the author encourages Anglo-American critics to think more expansively and comparatively about service, so that new connections might be drawn between the supposedly vanished world of servants and service and the global service economy in which we all participate today.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2279-7149			WOS:000357313700002		
J	Hawkins, Brent L.; McGuire, Francis A.; Britt, Thomas W.; Linder, Sandra M.								Identifying contextual influences of community reintegration among injured servicemembers								JOURNAL OF REHABILITATION RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT				52	2			235	246		10.1682/JRRD.2014.08.0195			2015	2015	Research suggests that community reintegration (CR) after injury and rehabilitation is difficult for many servicemembers. However, little is known about the influence of the contextual factors, both personal and environmental, on CR. Framed within the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health and social cognitive theory, the quantitative portion of a larger mixed-methods study of 51 injured, community-dwelling servicemembers compared the relative contribution of contextual factors between groups of servicemembers with different levels of CR. Cluster analysis indicated three groups of servicemembers showing low, moderate, and high levels of CR. Statistical analyses identified contextual factors that significantly discriminated between CR clusters. Multivariate analysis of variance and discriminant analysis indicated significant contributions of general self-efficacy, services and assistance barriers, physical and structural barriers, attitudes and support barriers, perceived level of disability and/or handicap, work and school barriers, and policy barriers to CR scores. Overall, analyses indicated that injured servicemembers with lower CR scores had lower general self-efficacy scores, reported more difficulty with environmental barriers, and reported their injuries as more disabling.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0748-7711	1938-1352		WOS:000356317600011	26237496

This manuscript examines the accuracy and convergence of a reduced-order model (ROM). The ROM is derived from an idealized packaging system consisting of a rod of polymer foam with an attached end mass. The work begins with an introduction to the complex cyclic softening and the viscoelastic and nonlinear stress-strain behaviour exhibited by expanded polymer foam. The partial differential equations and associated boundary conditions governing the motion of the system are obtained. The equations are reduced to an ROM using the assumed modes method. Approximate eigenvalues are compared with both exact and experimental eigenvalues reported in literature. Finally, the ROM is compared with the frequency response functions of the exact solution and those obtained experimentally. Both results are used to determine the number of modal equations needed for the ROM to accurately capture the steady-state dynamic behaviour of the packaging system.

The rate at which these gels break down is important for controlling drug release. However, it is challenging to monitor the gel through tissue due to optical scattering and tissue autofluorescence. Herein we describe a method to detect through tissue the gelation and de-gelation processes of alginate gel using magnetically modulated optical nanoprobes (MagMOONs). The MagMOONs are fluorescent magnetic microspheres coated with a thin layer of opaque metal on one hemisphere. The metal layer prevents excitation and emission light from passing through one side of the MagMOONs, which creates an orientation-dependent fluorescence intensity. These magnetic particles also align in an external magnetic field and give blinking signals when they rotate to follow the magnetic field modulation. The blinking signals from these MagMOONs are distinguished from background autofluorescence and can be tracked on a single particle level in the absence of tissue, or by averaging an ensemble of particles through tissue. When these MagMOONs are dispersed in alginate gel, they become sensors for the detection of either the gelation with the addition of a multivalent cation (Ca2+, Cu2+) or the de-gelation as de-gelling agents like ammonium chloride, sodium citrate, or alginate lyase are added. Herein the release of copper ion as an antimicrobial from the gel can be tracked. Our method also can potentially be applied to detect bacterial biofilm formation and other biosensors and drug delivery systems based on enzyme-catalyzed breakdown of gel components.					5th International Conference on the Development of Biomedical Engineering in Vietnam5th International Conference on the Development of Biomedical Engineering in Vietnam	JUN 16-18, 2014JUN 16-18, 2014	Vietnam Natl Univ; Int Univ Vietnam Natl Univ; Arizona State Univ; ViKOmed; Trung Son Sci Equipment; SAIGON SCIENTISTS; USN Global, Off Naval Res, Sci & Technol; Natl Instruments; U S ARMY RDECOM; Univ Alberta; ITS Vietnam; SAIGON ISG; SPIEVietnam Natl Univ; Int Univ Vietnam Natl Univ; Arizona State Univ; ViKOmed; Trung Son Sci Equipment; SAIGON SCIENTISTS; USN Global, Off Naval Res, Sci & Technol; Natl Instruments; U S ARMY RDECOM; Univ Alberta; ITS Vietnam; SAIGON ISG; SPIE	Ho Chi Minh City, VIETNAMHo Chi Minh City, VIETNAM	0	0	0	0	0	0			1680-0737		978-3-319-11776-8; 978-3-319-11775-1	WOS:000357778100016

Few reports exist about the effects of T. obtusus feeding on turfgrass in field settings. A 2-year field trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of T. obtusus on turf quality and root weight of Tifway bermudagrass and Empire zoysiagrass. Core samples and turf quality ratings were taken on multiple sampling dates, from plots at multiple locations in South Carolina, USA. Nematode population densities, root weights and turf quality were used to describe the linear and non-linear relationships between them. Zoysiagrass root weights increased, but turf quality decreased with nematode population density. Bermudagrass root weights and quality decreased in response to increased nematode population densities. Our results show that T. obtusus can cause significant reductions in turfgrass quality, and zoysiagrass and bermudagrass were able to tolerate low nematode population densities before turf quality reductions were detectable.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1388-5545			WOS:000358299300005

In this paper we established a long-term chick forebrain neuron culture (C-FBN-C) on MEAs with a more than 5 month long lifespan and up to 5 month long stability in morphology and physiological functions; characterized C-FBN-C morphologically, functionally and developmentally; partially compared its functional features with its rodent counterpart; and discussed its pros and cons as a novel biosensor system in comparison to its rodent counterpart and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Our results show that C-FBN-C on the MEA platform (1) can be used as a biosensor of its own type in a wide spectrum of basic biomedical research; (2) is of value in comparative physiology in cross-species studies; and (3) may have potential to be used as an alternative, cost-effective approach to its rodent counterpart within shared common functional domains (such as specific types of ligand-gated ion channel receptors and subtypes expressed in the cortical tissues of both species) in large-scale environmental neurotoxicant screening that would otherwise require millions of animals.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2046-2069			WOS:000357803200076	26989485

Doping graphene with boron (B) or nitrogen (N) has led to p- or n-type graphene; however, the electron mobility in doped-graphene is severely compromised due to increased electron-defect scattering. Here, we demonstrate through Raman spectroscopy, nonlinear optical and ultrafast spectroscopy, and density functional theory that the graphitic dopant configuration is stable in graphene and does not significantly alter electron-electron or electron-phonon scattering, that is otherwise present in doped graphene, by preserving the crystal coherence length (L-a).									4	0	0	0	0	4			2046-2069			WOS:000357961800073

The thermal loads developed using the proposed approach are simple, yet accounts for the hourly variation of the thermal loads. The analysis to develop these ground thermal loads is based on the change-point statistical analysis to determine the heating and cooling episodes. Heating and cooling loads are then converted into sine waves with an equivalent amplitude and the episodes determined from the change-point statistical analysis. Using the approximated equivalent sine waves, finite element or finite difference methods can be utilized to predict the long-term performance of the heat exchangers. The proposed methodology is compared to other existing approaches and showed better representation of the varying hourly ground thermal loads for a 1 year period. Moreover, a long-term thermal performance is predicted using the equivalent sine waves developed for balanced and unbalanced ground loads. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The authors focus specifically on problems faced by students with weak literacy skills who enroll in universities that do not have admission requirements. They consider the importance of early learning and educational experiences that positively affect college readiness and highlight the responsibilities of institutions and faculty in assisting underprepared students who are enrolled in postsecondary programs.Findings - Findings suggest the key to college readiness and postsecondary academic success depend on students' ability to attain (a) proficiency in literacy at early grade levels, (b) knowledge of expository texts, (c) study strategies, and (d) personal behaviors such as paying attention, completing assignments, persisting in difficult tasks, and self-regulation that contribute to academic success.Originality/value - This paper presents a synthesis of findings from reports on postsecondary students' preparedness for college-level work. In that the authors draw on their experiences as professors in different types of institutions, this article is highly original and makes a unique contribution. Currently, there is a belief in the USA that everyone needs a college education. The authors demonstrate that this view is neither accurate nor realistic.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1175-8708			WOS:000357388500004

Starting with the organic fluor 2-(1-naphthyl)-5-phenyloxazole (alpha NPO), the vNPO and allylNPO monomers were synthesized using Stille coupling followed by purification. The final products were obtained with yields of similar to 95% and similar to 55% for vNPO and allylNPO. The absorption/emission spectra of alpha NPO, vNPO and allylNPO revealed that vNPO has the largest red-shifted in emission with an average wavelength of similar to 420 nm, which is an advantage for increasing photomultiplier tube sensitivity without the need to add a wavelength shifter. Stable scintillating resin beads were prepared through copolymerization of the newly synthesized fluor monomers with styrene or 4-methylstyrene and divinylbenzene in the presence of toluene porogen. The resin beads were chemically stable and retained the ability to scintillate efficiently after energy deposition of beta particles from Tc-99. This result indicates efficient energy transfer occurs from the base polymer to the covalently attached fluors with subsequent fluorescence in the presence of ionizing radiation.									5	0	0	1	0	5			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000357416500014

DISTRIBUTED COMPUTATION OF PARETO SETS								SIAM JOURNAL ON OPTIMIZATION				25	2			1083	1109		10.1137/130929564			2015	2015	The needs of multidisciplinary engineering design have motivated the development of distributed solution approaches to computing efficient solutions to decomposable multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs). The decomposition is necessary due to the assumption that the overall MOP is not solvable since access to its solution space is subproblem-restricted. The state-of-the-art analyses for distributed solution approaches such as the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and the block coordinate descent (BCD) method were developed in the context of problem decomposition originating in a single objective setting and are not immediately applicable to MOPs. Applying certain scalarization techniques well-suited for nonconvex MOPs, the decomposable MOP is reformulated into a single objective problem (SOP) but the decomposability is not preserved and the SOP is not suitable for the application of ADMM. Furthermore, coupling between the subproblems makes BCD in its current form likewise inadequate. To address these challenges to distributed multiobjective optimization, existing theory is extended for (1) iterative augmented Lagrangian coordination techniques and (2) the block coordinate descent method. For the former, each augmented Lagrangian subproblem is subject to convex constraints and is solved approximately for solutions satisfying a necessary condition for optimality (but not necessarily optimal). For the latter, existing convergence proofs under generalized convexity assumptions are redeveloped so that new insights and convergence results become evident. An integration of the above two convergence analyses yields convergence results for a distributed solution approach that addresses coupling between subproblems and does not require convergence of the generated sequence of solution-multiplier pairs. Based on this study, a multi-objective decomposition algorithm is developed for the distributed generation of efficient solutions to nonconvex decomposable MOPs.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1052-6234	1095-7189		WOS:000357406900014

One of the most common examples is the single event upset (SEU), which occurs when a high-energy ionizing particle passes through an integrated circuit, changing the value of a single bit by releasing its charge. The SEU could cause damage and potentially fatal failures to spacecraft and satellites. In this paper, we present an approach that extends the AVR-GCC compiler to protect the system stack from SEUs through duplication, validation, and recovery. Three applications are used to verify our approach, and the time and space overhead characteristics are evaluated.					12th European Conference on Wireless Sensor Networks (EWSN)12th European Conference on Wireless Sensor Networks (EWSN)	FEB 09-11, 2015FEB 09-11, 2015		Porto, PORTUGALPorto, PORTUGAL	0	0	0	0	0	0			0302-9743		978-3-319-15582-1; 978-3-319-15581-4	WOS:000357677300020

Here, we investigated the possible mechanism of exogenously applied BRs on reactive oxygen species (ROS), antioxidant defence and methylglyoxal (MG) detoxification systems in Ficus concinna seedlings grown under high-temperature (HT) stress for 48 h. Our results showed that the activities of ascorbate peroxidase (APX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and glyoxalase II (Gly II) were increased under two levels of HT stress. Compared with control the activities of catalase (CAT) and dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) were not changed due to HT stress. The activities of glutathione reductase (GR), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR) and glyoxalase I (Gly I) were increased only at moderate HT stress. Despite these protective mechanisms, HT stress induced oxidative stress in F. concinna seedlings, as indicated by the increased levels of ROS, malondialdehyde (MDA) and MG, and the reductions in chlorophyll levels and relative water content. The contents of reduced glutathione (GSH) and ascorbate (AsA) were not changed under moderate HT stress. Spraying with 24-epibrassinolide (EBR) alone had little influence on the non-enzymatic antioxidants and the activities of antioxidant enzymes. However, EBR pretreatment under HT stress resulted in an increase in GSH and AsA content, maintenance of high redox state of GSH and AsA, and enhanced ROS and MG detoxification by further elevating the activities of SOD, GST, GPX, APX, MDHAR, GR, DHAR, Gly I and Gly II, as evident by lower level of ROS, MDA and MG. It may be concluded that EBR could alleviate the HT-induced oxidative stress by increasing the enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant defence, and glyoxalase systems in F. concinna seedlings.									2	0	0	2	0	2			2041-2851			WOS:000357415400001

Thus, here we provide a synthetic and critical review of the methods used to evaluate the impacts of plant invasions and provide recommendations for future research. We review the types of methods available and report patterns in methods used, including the duration and spatial scale of studies and plant functional groups examined, from 410 peer-reviewed papers published between 1971 and 2011. We found that there has been a marked increase in papers published on plant invasion impacts since 2003 and that more than half of all studies employed observational methods while <5 % included predictive modelling. Most of the studies were temporally and spatially restricted with 51 % of studies lasting <1 year and almost half of all studies conducted in plots or mesocosms <1 m(2). There was also a bias in life form studied: more than 60 % of all studies evaluated impacts of invasive forbs and graminoids while, 16 % focused on invasive trees. To more effectively quantify invasion impacts, we argue that longer-term experimental research and more studies that use predictive modelling and evaluate impacts of invasions on ecosystem processes and fauna are needed. Combining broad-scale observational studies with experiments and predictive modelling may provide the most insight into invasion impacts for policymakers and landmanagers seeking to reduce the effects of plant invasions.									2	0	0	2	0	2			2041-2851			WOS:000357418200001

A previous report [P. Kuberry and H. Lee, Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg., 267 (2013), pp. 594-605] has suggested that recasting the FSI problem in the context of optimal control may significantly reduce computation time. This paper introduces a Neumann type control along with detailed analysis for the stability and existence of an optimal solution for a given time step. The existence of Lagrange multipliers is proved, and an optimality system is derived. A gradient-based optimization algorithm is then presented with numerical results confirming its effectiveness in computing an accurate solution.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0036-1429	1095-7170		WOS:000357407600013

We developed a two-stage optimization program that first determines the optimal partial disassembly sequence according to reuse value only, followed by the second stage that finds the optimal partial disassembly sequence that also includes sequence dependence task times. We prove the optimality of the two-stage approach under the condition that all components with any positive reuse value must be included in the final sequence. If this condition does not need to be met, a task hedging policy is shown to be effective. (C) 2015 The Authors.

An Explicitly Decoupled Variational Multiscale Method for Incompressible, Non-Isothermal Flows								COMPUTATIONAL METHODS IN APPLIED MATHEMATICS				15	1			1	20		10.1515/cmam-2014-0026			JAN 2015	2015	We propose, analyze and test a fully decoupled, but still unconditionally stable and optimally accurate, variational multiscale stabilization (VMS) for incompressible, non-isothermal fluid flows. The VMS stabilization is implemented as a post-processing step, and thus can be used with existing codes. A full numerical analysis of the method is given that proves unconditional stability with respect to the timestep size, and that the method converges optimally in both time and space. Numerical tests are provided that confirm the theoretical results, and test the method on a benchmark problem for Marsigli flow.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1609-4840	1609-9389		WOS:000356870500001

We show that for testing Kaplansky's direct finiteness conjecture, it suffices to test it on ULIE groups, and we show that there is an infinite family of nonamenable ULIE groups. We consider the invertibles conjecture, and we show that it is equivalent to a question about ULIE groups. By calculating all the ULIE groups over the field K = F2 of two elements, for ranks (3, n), n = 11, and (5, 5), we show that the direct finiteness conjecture and the invertibles conjecture (which implies the zero divisors conjecture) hold for these ranks over F-2.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1058-6458	1944-950X		WOS:000356873900007

Assuming grey-body emissivity, the apparent size of debris objects may be inferred from that data. This report describes a general model for debris size distributed near the GEO belt. Linear and nonlinear regression models were fit to data from the WISE orbital debris catalog. Using those results we estimate the sensitivity of the instrument to detection of small debris objects near the GEO belt.

J	Grzechnik, Andrzej; Corner, Sara; Kolis, Joseph W.; Friese, Karen								Crystal structure and high-pressure stability of hydrothermally grown LiKTmF5								SOLID STATE SCIENCES				39				40	44		10.1016/j.solidstatesciences.2014.11.002			JAN 2015	2015	Single crystals of LiKTmF5 were grown hydrothermally. Its crystal structure was studied with single-crystal X-ray diffraction to 8.6 GPa. The material is monoclinic (P2(1)/c, Z = 4) and does not undergo any phase transition in the pressure range studied here. The analysis of its pseudosymmetry with respect to the minimal k-supergroup C2/m reveals that the deviations of the individual atoms from the respective higher symmetrical positions in C2/m are increasing on compression, i.e., due to the reduction of the unit-cell volume. Such a behaviour is the opposite of the effect of incorporation of various M cations in the LiKMF5 materials (M:Y and rare earths) at atmospheric conditions, since LiKYbF5 and LiKLuF5 with the smallest unit cells crystallize in space group C2/m, while LiLYF5 with a larger unit cell has P2(1)/c symmetry.

THERMAL DECOMPOSITION BEHAVIOR OF LOBLOLLY PINE STEMWOOD, BARK, AND LIMBS/FOLIAGE USING TGA AND DSC TECHNIQUES								TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE				58	2			509	518					2015	2015	A standing tree before harvest has three primary components: bark, limbs/foliage, and stemwood. For a variety of reasons, most of the development work on forest biomass energy potential has used stemwood (also known as clean chips) as the feedstock. However, the amount of bark and limbs/foliage in a tree is significant (around 25% on mass basis) and may influence the economics of the forest-to-bioenergy process. In this study, the rate and kinetics of thermal decomposition of these three primary components were studied at heating rates of 5 degrees C to 20 degrees C min(-1) in both nitrogen and air atmospheres. The average mass fractions of the components were 74.6% stemwood, 18.2% limbs/foliage, and 7.2% bark. The stemwood component significantly had the lowest ash (0.32%, d.b.) and highest volatile matter (85.6%, d.b.) contents. Major loss in sample mass (40% to 60% of original mass depending on sample type) of each component occurred between 150 degrees C and 425 degrees C when the samples were thermally decomposed in nitrogen atmosphere. In air atmosphere, virtually all of the non-ash component of each sample was volatilized within the temperature range of 150 degrees C to 600 degrees C. The activation energies of stemwood were at least 20% lower than those of the low volatile matter content bark and limbs/foliage. The activation energies for the samples thermally decomposed in air atmosphere were higher than the corresponding values for nitrogen atmosphere.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2151-0032	2151-0040		WOS:000353149900031

The results indicated that L-cysteine pretreatment significantly inhibited the increase of formaldehyde content and browning during the drying process; these increases in the pretreatment groups ranged from 7.0% to 14.0% and 65.4% to 68.9%, respectively, of that of the control groups. While the L-cysteine pretreatment did not seem to have a significant effect on controlling the formaldehyde content during the canning process, the increase of the browning degree of the canned products of the pretreatment groups ranged from 64.8% to 78.5% of that of the control groups, indicating the inhibitive effect of L-cysteine on browning during the canning process of L. edodes. Overall, L-cysteine pretreatment improved the sensory quality of both dried and canned L. edodes.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1521-9437	1940-4344		WOS:000354909800007	25954964	
J	Stevens, Garrison; Van Buren, Kendra; Wheeler, Elizabeth; Atamturktur, Sez					Van Buren, Kendra/0000-0002-0495-2354			Evaluating the fidelity and robustness of calibrated numerical model predictions An application on a wind turbine blade								ENGINEERING COMPUTATIONS				32	3			621	642		10.1108/EC-09-2013-0217			2015	2015	Purpose - Numerical models are being increasingly relied upon to evaluate wind turbine performance by simulating phenomena that are infeasible to measure experimentally. These numerical models, however, require a large number of input parameters that often need to be calibrated against available experiments. Owing to the unavoidable scarcity of experiments and inherent uncertainties in measurements, this calibration process may yield non-unique solutions, i.e. multiple sets of parameters may reproduce the available experiments with similar fidelity. The purpose of this paper is to study the trade-off between fidelity to measurements and the robustness of this fidelity to uncertainty in calibrated input parameters.Design/methodology/approach - Here, fidelity is defined as the ability of the model to reproduce measurements and robustness is defined as the allowable variation in the input parameters with which the model maintains a predefined level of threshold fidelity. These two vital attributes of model predictiveness are evaluated in the development of a simplified finite element beam model of the CX-100 wind turbine blade.Findings - Findings of this study show that calibrating the input parameters of a numerical model with the sole objective of improving fidelity to available measurements degrades the robustness of model predictions at both tested and untested settings. A more optimal model may be obtained by calibration methods considering both fidelity and robustness. Multi-criteria Decision Making further confirms the conclusion that the optimal model performance is achieved by maintaining a balance between fidelity and robustness during calibration.Originality/value - Current methods for model calibration focus solely on fidelity while the authors focus on the trade-off between fidelity and robustness.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0264-4401	1758-7077		WOS:000355829900004

The model is upgraded through the introduction of the sixth module in the present work in recognition of the fact that in thick steel GMAW weldments, the overall ballistic performance of the armor may become controlled by the (often inferior) ballistic limits of its weld (fusion and heat-affected) zones.Findings - The upgraded GMAW process model is next applied to the case of butt-welding of MIL A46100 (a prototypical high-hardness armor-grade martensitic steel) workpieces using filler-metal electrodes made of the same material. The predictions of the upgraded GMAW process model pertaining to the spatial distribution of the material microstructure and ballistic-limit-controlling mechanical properties within the MIL A46100 butt-weld are found to be consistent with general expectations and prior observations.Originality/value - To the authors' knowledge, the present work is the first reported attempt to establish, using computational modeling, functional relationships between the GMAW process parameters and the mechanical properties controlling the ballistic limit of the resulting weld.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0264-4401	1758-7077		WOS:000355829900008

Mobile health (mHealth) is one of the most promising new advances in health care technology. mHealth is defined as the use of mobile technology in the provision of health care delivery or health promotion (Qiang, Yamamichi, Hausman, & Altman, 2011). The need for innovative and effective interventions for the prevention and management of chronic illness is evident. The use of mHealth interventions in the treatment and monitoring of chronic illness is still young but shows great promise. Currently, the public health and psychological sciences are using their theories to guide interventional studies by operationalizing concepts through mHealth's multifaceted capabilities for patient interaction. Outcomes measures from chronic illness-mHealth studies are thematically evaluated by using theoretical nursing outcome-related concepts of Meleis's transitions theory and Mishel's uncertainty in illness theory. Despite a small sample of articles, there are strong themes of activation and engagement within this literature review. The application of nursing theory in mHealth offers a new method to operationalize theoretical concepts, test theory-based interventions, and gain new contextual insight into the health-illness patient experience.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1541-6577	1945-7286		WOS:000356019400005	25799695

Phylogeny and generic limits in New World Exosternini (Coleoptera: Histeridae: Histerinae)								SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY				40	1			109	142		10.1111/syen.12095			JAN 2015	2015	Exosternini are a very species-rich group of Histeridae, occurring nearly worldwide, with particular concentrations in the Neotropical and Afrotropical regions. In the New World, the group comprises over 400 described species, in 12 genera, with approximately 250 additional species awaiting description. Generic limits in this group are poorly defined. A phylogenetic analysis of all known New World species, described and undescribed, with over 50 outgroup taxa from other genera and tribes of Histerinae was undertaken, based on 259 morphological characters, adding 18S, 28S and cytochrome oxidase I sequences for a subset of 150 taxa. The genera HypobletusSchmidt, YarmisterWenzel, KaszabisterMazur, MecistostethusMarseul and MegalocraerusLewis were each supported as monophyletic. BaconiaLewis was rendered paraphyletic by the inclusion of StrigisterCaterino et al. The bulk of OperclipygusMarseul was monophyletic, although the O. plicicollis group was not always included. The genus PhelisterMarseul was paraphyletic many times over, with members of Operclipygus, Mecistostethus, Kaszabister, PseudisterBickhardt, Conchita Mazur and NunbergiaMazur nested within, indicating that Phelister is in need of significant revision.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0307-6970	1365-3113		WOS:000347453400008

Participants were also randomly assigned to read vignettes that varied the strictness of organizational workplace romance policies. Then, participants completed measures of their willingness to engage in a workplace romance.Findings - Favorable attitudes about, and prior engagement in, workplace romances were positively related to the willingness to engage in a workplace romance. Prior engagement in workplace romances and conscientiousness were both related to attitudes about workplace romances. Additionally, the interaction between conscientiousness and organizational workplace romance policies significantly predicted the willingness to engage in a workplace romance.Research limitations/implications - The current study used hypothetical scenarios and a convenience sample to collect data, which may affect the study's external validity.Practical implications - Organizations grappling with the issue of workplace romances should consider how employee characteristics may interact with policies regulating workplace romances.Originality/value - This study is the first to examine the links between both prior engagement in workplace romances and personality variables (i.e. conscientiousness) and their relation to the willingness to engage in workplace romances. In addition, this is the first experimental study to examine the interaction between personality (i.e. conscientiousness) and organizational policy in predicting the willingness to engage workplace romances.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0268-3946	1758-7778		WOS:000355923000005

J	Kucukkal, Tugba G; Alexov, Emil								Structural, Dynamical, and Energetical Consequences of Rett Syndrome Mutation R133C in MeCP2.								Computational and mathematical methods in medicine				2015				746157	746157		10.1155/2015/746157			2015	2015	Rett Syndrome (RTT) is a progressive neurodevelopmental disease affecting females. RTT is caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene and various amino acid substitutions have been identified clinically in different domains of the multifunctional MeCP2 protein encoded by this gene. The R133C variant in the methylated-CpG-binding domain (MBD) of MeCP2 is the second most common disease-causing mutation in the MBD. Comparative molecular dynamics simulations of R133C mutant and wild-type MBD have been performed to understand the impact of the mutation on structure, dynamics, and interactions of the protein and subsequently understand the disease mechanism. Two salt bridges within the protein and two critical hydrogen bonds between the protein and DNA are lost upon the R133C mutation. The mutation was found to weaken the interaction with DNA and also cause loss of helicity within the 141-144 region.

Asymmetric Conduction and Stability of Polymer Tantalum Capacitors								ECS JOURNAL OF SOLID STATE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				4	7			N70	N75		10.1149/2.0211507jss			2015	2015	Conduction asymmetry and DC leakage (DCL) current variations with time were investigated in Polymer Hermetically Sealed (PHS) Ta capacitors. The hermetic design facilitates the control of the atmosphere inside these Ta capacitors, in particular the amount of moisture, and maintains it during long-term testing. These conditions were utilized to determine the dominant mechanisms responsible for DCL degradation and failures at normal and reverse polarities. The presence of moisture was found to have a profound effect on the DCL and breakdown voltage (BDV) of these devices, depending on the polarity. For humid capacitors, the DCL magnitude and stability were significantly improved for normal polarity, which was attributed to moisture acting as a plasticizer increasing polymer chain mobility while decreasing relaxation time of the interface dipoles. However, at reverse polarity DCL and stability degraded over time. This was attributed primarily to H+ ion diffusion toward the Ta/Ta2O5 interface and eventually oxygen migration into the Ta anode. In dry capacitors the reverse polarity leakage was minimal due to the absence of the creation of H+ ions, while at normal polarity DCL and breakdown were significantly degraded compared to humid devices under similar conditions.

Renewable biopolymers, such as sodium lignosulfate (SLS), have attracted interest for electrodes when mixed with conducting polymers due to their higher charge-capacity and natural abundance. The availability of SLS is limited and will continue to decrease, while alkali lignin (AL), which accounts for 98% of lignin from paper-pulping, exhibits poor solubility in acidic electrolytes used for electropolymerization of conducting polymers. Here, we utilize organic acid solvents to overcome processing limitations in order to synthesize electrodes comprising polypyrrole (PPy) and SLS. Compared to PPy/SLS, electrodes containing PPy/AL exhibit an increase in capacitance from 312 F g(-1) to 444 F g(-1), and a decrease in relaxation time constant from 1.7 to 1 s. Furthermore, we showed that the electrochemical performance of PPy/AL electrodes could be further increased by incorporating AL with higher phenolic content that is obtained from an elevated-temperature, pH-driven fractionation process.									6	0	0	0	0	6			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000354952500021

Thymus and spleen participate in elasmobranch lymphopoiesis in much the same way as they do in higher vertebrates, but in the absence of bony skeletons and lymphatic systems, sharks and their batoid relatives possess unique bone-marrow equivalent tissues that effectively compensate for the lack of marrow and lymphatic tissues. These unique lymphomyeloid tissues are the epigonal and Leydig organs, associated with the gonads and esophagus, respectively. These four tissues/organs constitute the primary sites for leukocyte production in the elasmobranch immune system.									0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4665-9575-0; 978-1-4665-9574-3	WOS:000354732300006

Such sources have potential applications in both imaging and communication systems. However, many applications require precise control over the spectral emission from these devices and the current blue laser diodes lack this ability. In this paper, we demonstrate a method to control the spectral emission from GaN blue laser diodes.We present the simulation and subsequent fabrication of a guided-mode resonance filter (GMRF) that can be used to lock the output wavelength of a GaN blue laser diode. Successful locking of the emission wavelength with respect to fluctuations in the surrounding environment addresses challenges associated with communication systems. Our experiment uses an optical cavity with a GaN blue laser diode source and an on-axis narrowband GMRF fabricated for 445.2 nm. Based on spectral drift of the diode emission caused by an increase in input current, experimental measurements were taken with the GMRF installed to verify wavelength locking capability.

J	Krauss, Ken W.; Duberstein, Jamie A.; Conner, William H.								Assessing stand water use in four coastal wetland forests using sapflow techniques: annual estimates, errors and associated uncertainties								HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES				29	1			112	127		10.1002/hyp.10130			JAN 1 2015	2015	Forests comprise approximately 37% of the terrestrial land surface and influence global water cycling. However, very little attention has been directed towards understanding environmental impacts on stand water use (S) or in identifying rates of S from specific forested wetlands. Here, we use sapflow techniques to address two separate but linked objectives: (1) determine S in four, hydrologically distinctive South Carolina (USA) wetland forests from 2009-2010 and (2) describe potential error, uncertainty and stand-level variation associated with these assessments. Sapflow measurements were made from a number of tree species for approximately 2-8months over 2years to initiate the model, which was applied to canopy trees (DBH>10-20cm). We determined that S in three healthy forested wetlands varied from 1.97-3.97mmday(-1) or 355-687mmyear(-1) when scaled. In contrast, saltwater intrusion impacted individual tree physiology and size class distributions on a fourth site, which decreased S to 0.61-1.13mmday(-1) or 110-196mmyear(-1). The primary sources of error in estimations using sapflow probes would relate to calibration of probes and standardization relative to no flow periods and accounting for accurate sapflow attenuation with radial depth into the sapwood by species and site. Such inherent variation in water use among wetland forest stands makes small differences in S (<200mmyear(-1)) difficult to detect statistically through modelling, even though small differences may be important to local water cycling. These data also represent some of the first assessments of S from temperate, coastal forested wetlands along the Atlantic coast of the USA.

Yaniv, ZR; Webster, RJ		Towards Real-time Remote Processing of Laparoscopic Video								MEDICAL IMAGING 2015: IMAGE-GUIDED PROCEDURES, ROBOTIC INTERVENTIONS, AND MODELING		Proceedings of SPIE		9415						94151U	10.1117/12.2082224			2015	2015	Laparoscopic surgery is a minimally invasive surgical technique where surgeons insert a small video camera into the patient's body to visualize internal organs and small tools to perform surgical procedures. However, the benefit of small incisions has a drawback of limited visualization of subsurface tissues, which can lead to navigational challenges in the delivering of therapy. Image-guided surgery (IGS) uses images to map subsurface structures and can reduce the limitations of laparoscopic surgery. One particular laparoscopic camera system of interest is the vision system of the daVinci-Si robotic surgical system (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The video streams generate approximately 360 megabytes of data per second, demonstrating a trend towards increased data sizes in medicine, primarily due to higher-resolution video cameras and imaging equipment. Processing this data on a bedside PC has become challenging and a high-performance computing (HPC) environment may not always be available at the point of care.To process this data on remote HPC clusters at the typical 30 frames per second (fps) rate, it is required that each 11.9 MB video frame be processed by a server and returned within 1/30th of a second. The ability to acquire, process and visualize data in real-time is essential for performance of complex tasks as well as minimizing risk to the patient. As a result, utilizing high-speed networks to access computing clusters will lead to real-time medical image processing and improve surgical experiences by providing real-time augmented laparoscopic data. We aim to develop a medical video processing system using an Open Flow software defined network that is capable of connecting to multiple remote medical facilities and HPC servers.

In an initial set of experiments, a fiber with a core diameter of similar to 50 mu m, and a calculated effective area of 1450 mu m(2) in a straight fiber, was used to generate approximately 600 W. In this case, the input seed was modulated using a sinusoidal format at a frequency of 400 MHz. The output, however, was multimode as the fiber design did not allow for single-mode operation at this wavelength. A second fiber was then fabricated to operate predominantly in single mode at 1064 nm by having the seed closer to the short wavelength edge of the bandgap. This fiber was used to demonstrate 400 W of single-frequency output with excellent beam quality. As the signal power exceeded 450 W, there was significant degradation in the beam quality due to the modal instability. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, the power scaling results obtained in this work far exceed results from prior state of the art all-solid photonic bandgap fiber lasers.

Potential for Nonnative Endozoochorous Seed Dispersal by White-Tailed Deer in a Southeastern Maritime Forest								INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT				8	1			32	43		10.1614/IPSM-D-14-00027.1			JAN-MAR 2015	2015	Nonnative invasive plants (NNIP) have far-reaching effects on native ecosystems worldwide. Understanding the role of generalist seed dispersers in spreading NNIP across the landscape is important to the conservation of native ecosystems and to the management of NNIP. We studied white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) as a seed disperser in a mixed maritime pine (Pinus spp.) forests on Parris Island, SC, with particular interest in the dispersal of Chinese tallowtree [Triadica sebifera (L.) Small], a highly invasive tree species in the southeastern United States, which is a management concern on Parris Island, SC. We collected deer scat pellet groups along transects in two forest types: those that had recently been treated with silvicultural timber harvest (thinned) and those that have not been so treated (unthinned). Using two pellet-treatment methods, directly planting or rinsing and sorting, we determined that, out of 25 species grown under greenhouse conditions, 28% (n = 7) were nonnative, small-seeded, herbaceous species. However, T. sebifera was not identified in either of the two treatment methods. Recent forest thinning significantly affected the number of species determined in deer pellet groups (F = 8.37; df = 1; P < 0.01), with more native plant species identified in unthinned (<(x)over bar> = 25 +/- 11) than in thinned ((x) over bar 3 +/- 10) forest stands (F = 5.33; df = 1; P = 0.02). Our results indicate that white-tailed deer are actively dispersing nonnative seeds but not those of T. sebifera or other woody NNIP.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1939-7291	1939-747X		WOS:000353162800003		
J	Li, Lin; Wang, Lin; Alexov, Emil								On the energy components governing molecular recognition in the framework of continuum approaches.								Frontiers in molecular biosciences				2				5	5		10.3389/fmolb.2015.00005			2015	2015	Molecular recognition is a process that brings together several biological macromolecules to form a complex and one of the most important characteristics of the process is the binding free energy. Various approaches exist to model the binding free energy, provided the knowledge of the 3D structures of bound and unbound molecules. Among them, continuum approaches are quite appealing due to their computational efficiency while at the same time providing predictions with reasonable accuracy. Here we review recent developments in the field emphasizing on the importance of adopting adequate description of physical processes taking place upon the binding. In particular, we focus on the efforts aiming at capturing some of the atomistic details of the binding phenomena into the continuum framework. When possible, the energy components are reviewed independently of each other. However, it is pointed out that rigorous approaches should consider all energy contributions on the same footage. The two major schemes for utilizing the individual energy components to predict binding affinity are outlined as well.									2	0	0	0	0	2						MEDLINE:25988173	25988173

Redefining Baselines in Endangered Species Recovery								JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT				79	1			3	9		10.1002/jwmg.800			JAN 2015	2015	Baselines rooted in historical records or concepts of previous conditions are necessarily used to identify and generate recovery goals for endangered species. However, strict adherence to various spatial, temporal, and genetic baselines can limit endangered species recovery actions, success, and the broader conservation of biodiversity. Recent approaches that deviate from historical baselines such as assisted colonization and intentional hybridization have been used to facilitate recovery but lack broad acceptance and an underpinning conceptual framework to guide their use in practice. We here present a novel framework for addressing when baseline-abandoning approaches should be implemented that requires both scientific input and management-defined thresholds. We submit that in cases where species face extreme endangerment and managers have little chance of reducing or ameliorating future threats within a species' historical range, it is better to embrace a more flexible recovery model that includes taking action that deviates from historical baselines. Embracing this reinterpretation of management baselines not only has the potential to advance endangered species recovery but could have important cascading effects on ecosystem-based approaches to conservation. Further, rethinking adherences to baselines can affect our broader social-psychological relationship with wildlife conservation and management. Overall, although historical data on baseline conditions will remain vital to the initial setting of recovery goals, many situations will require more dynamic interpretations of paths to recovering endangered species.

Furthermore, diffractive elements were designed based on the phase profile of this refractive element. Fabrication of the devices uses conventional photolithography on a fused silica substrate.

These properties directly relate to commercial and industrial applications including sensors, photonic waveguides, and acousto-optics. Multi-photon exposure can be used to photo-pattern thermally deposited As2S3 ChG glassy films of molecular clusters. Immersing the photo-patterned cross-linked material into a polar-solvent removes the unexposed material leaving behind a structure that is a negative-tone replica of the photo-pattern. Nano-structure arrays that were photo-patterned in single-layered A(s)2S(3) films through multi-photon direct laser writing (DLW) resulted in the production of nano-beads as a consequence of a standing wave effect. To overcome this effect, an anti-reflective (AR) layer of arsenic triselenide (As2Se3) was thermally deposited between the silicon substrate and the As2S3 layer, creating a multi-layered film. The chemical composition of the unexposed and photo-exposed multi-layered film was examined through Raman spectroscopy. Nano-structure arrays were photo-patterned in the multi-layered film and the resulting structure, morphology, and chemical composition were characterized, compared to results from the single-layered film, and correlated with the conditions of the thermal deposition, patterned irradiation, and etch processing.

RTT is caused by mutations in the MECP2 gene and various amino acid substitutions have been identified clinically in different domains of the multifunctional MeCP2 protein encoded by this gene. The R133C variant in the methylated-CpG-binding domain (MBD) of MeCP2 is the second most common disease-causing mutation in the MBD. Comparative molecular dynamics simulations of R133C mutant and wild-type MBD have been performed to understand the impact of the mutation on structure, dynamics, and interactions of the protein and subsequently understand the disease mechanism. Two salt bridges within the protein and two critical hydrogen bonds between the protein and DNA are lost upon the R133C mutation. The mutation was found to weaken the interaction with DNA and also cause loss of helicity within the 141-144 region. The structural, dynamical, and energetical consequences of R133C mutation were investigated in detail at the atomic resolution. Several important implications of this have been shown regarding protein stability and hydration dynamics as well as its interaction with DNA. The results are in agreement with previous experimental studies and further provide atomic level understanding of the molecular origin of RTT associated with R133C variant.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1748-670X	1748-6718		WOS:000354357000001

The compositions for each specimen were confirmed with a combination of Rietveld refinement and elemental analysis. Hall measurements indicate that holes are the dominant charge carriers in these materials. The electrical resistivity shows little temperature dependence up to 500 K and then increases with increasing temperature. The thermal conductivity decreases with increasing temperature with no indication of increase at higher temperatures suggesting a minimal bipolar diffusion effect in the thermal conductivity although these materials possess relatively small band-gaps as compared to that of other stannite compositions. A maximum ZT value of 0.56 was obtained at 700 K for Cu2.2Zn0.8SnSe3.7Te0.3 due to a relatively high Seebeck coefficient and low thermal conductivity.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000354203400032	25883041

Further power scaling is still much desired to increase throughput and to break new frontiers in science and defense. It has become very clear now that highly single-mode fibers with large effective mode areas are required to overcome both nonlinear effects and mode instability [1-3]. We have been studying all-solid photonic bandgap fibers (AS-PBF), which have open and highly dispersive cladding, making them ideal for higher-order-mode controls in large-mode-area fibers. I will review our recent progress in this area and, especially in ytterbium-doped AS-PBF lasers and amplifiers.

Conventional single-mode optical fibers with birefringence can only preserve the polarization when the incident beam is launched properly. Recent reports demonstrate that the birefringence in photonic bandgap fibers (PBFs) can provide single-polarization operation near the edge of transmission band by shifting the transmission band for the light with orthogonal polarizations. Here, we demonstrate a 50 mu m core Yb-doped polarizing photonic bandgap fiber (PBF) for single-polarization operation throughout the entire transmission band from 1010nm to 1170nm with a polarization extinction ratio (PER) of >5dB/m, which is >15dB/m near the short wavelength edge of the transmission band. The polarizing effect is due to the differential polarization transmission loss presented in this fiber, which is benefited from the fiber birefringence of 3.2x10(-4), obtained by incorporating low-index boron-doped rods on either side of the core. The achievement is based on the fact that light at fast axis has lower effective mode index which is closer to the modes in the photonic cladding and thus to be easily coupled into cladding. A 2.6m long straight fiber was tested in a laser configuration without any polarizers to achieve single polarized laser output with a PER value of 21dB at 1026nm lasing wavelength.

The analysis was focused on the investigation of specific aspects of the dynamic response and of the topological changes such as the deformation of highly sheared and densified regions, and the conversion of amorphous fused silica to SiO2 crystalline polymorphs (in particular, alpha-quartz and stishovite). The topological changes in question were determined by carrying out a postprocessing atom-coordination procedure. This procedure suggested the formation of stishovite (and perhaps alpha-quartz) within fused silica during ballistic impact. To rationalize the findings obtained, the all-atom molecular-level computational analysis is complemented by a series of quantum-mechanics density functional theory (DFT) computations. The latter computations enable determination of the relative potential energies of the fused silica, alpha-quartz and stishovite, under ambient pressure (i.e., under their natural densities) as well as under imposed (as high as 50 GPa) pressures (i.e., under higher densities) and shear strains. In addition, the transition states associated with various fused-silica devitrification processes were identified. The results obtained are found to be in good agreement with their respective experimental counterparts.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1687-4110	1687-4129		WOS:000354367600001

However, large dimensions and limited working distances of objective lenses in traditional fluorescence microscopes have limited the imaging applications mostly to superficial tissues. To overcome this disadvantage, researchers have developed the graded-index (GRIN) probes with small diameters for imaging internal organs of small animals in a minimally invasive fashion. Here, we present the development of a fluorescence endoscopic imaging system based on a GRIN lens using two-photon excitation. Experimental results showed that this system could perform dynamic fluorescence microendoscopic imaging and monitor the blood flow in anesthetized living mice using two-photon excitation.

In imaging applications, Bessel beams have been successfully used to provide extended focuses for volumetric imaging and uniformed illumination plane in light-sheet microscopy. Coupled with two-photon excitation, Bessel beams have been successfully used in realizing fluorescence projected volumetric imaging. We demonstrated previously a stereoscopic solution-two-photon fluorescence stereomicroscopy (TPFSM)-for recovering the depth information in volumetric imaging with Bessel beams. In TPFSM, tilted Bessel beams were used to generate stereoscopic images on a laser scanning two-photon fluorescence microscope; upon post image processing we could successfully provide 3D perception of acquired volume images by wearing anaglyph 3D glasses. However, tilted Bessel beams were generated by shifting either an axicon or an objective laterally; the slow imaging speed and severe aberrations made it hard to use in real-time volume imaging. In this article, we report recent improvements of TPFSM with newly designed scanner and imaging software, which allows 3D stereoscopic imaging without moving any of the optical components on the setup. This improvement has dramatically improved focusing qualities and imaging speed so that the TPFSM can be performed potentially in real-time to provide 3D visualization in scattering media without post image processing.

Synthesis and application of glycoconjugate-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles as potent anti-adhesion agents for reducing enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli infections								NANOSCALE				7	18			8326	8331		10.1039/c5nr00511f			2015	2015	Polyethylene oxide stabilized magnetic nanoparticles (PEO-MNPs) bio-functionalized with glycoconjugate (Neu5Ac(alpha 2-3)Gal(beta 1-4)-Glc beta- sp) (GM3-MNPs) are synthesized using click chemistry. Interaction of GM3-MNPs with Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) strain K99 (EC K99) is investigated using different microscopic techniques.

The relatively large length-to-diameter ratio provides guiding for both the pump and signal beams propagating in the SCF. The propagation and gain of signals with different modes were studied. A numerical method based on finite difference (FD) beam propagation method (BPM) combined with the rate equations was developed for theoretical simulation. The results are encouraging to demonstrate the advantages of SCF for its fiber-like beam guiding property and solid state material gain property. The simulation tool provides details about how the fiber shape and launched mode affect the gain and output beam shape as well as predicts the amplification behavior of such unique specialty fibers.

The need for characterization techniques towards identifying bulk scatter and assessing the quality. Assessment of optical quality and the identification of bulk scatter have been by simple visual inspection of thin samples of PLMs, thus making the measurements highly subjective and inaccurate. Angle Resolved Scatter ( ARS) measurement allows for the spatial mapping of scattered light at all possible angles about a sample, mapping the intensity for both forward scatter and back-scatter regions. The cumulative scattered light intensity, in the forward scatter direction, away from the specular beam is used for the comparison of bulk scattering between samples. This technique employ the detection of scattered light at all angles away from the specular beam directions and represented as a 2-D polar map. The high sensitivity of the ARS technique allows us to compare bulk scattering in different PLM samples which otherwise had similar transmitted beam wavefront distortions.

There is a need for characterization techniques, towards identifying bulk scatter and assessing the quality. Assessment of optical quality and the identification of bulk scatter have been by simple visual inspection of thin samples of PLMs, thus making the measurements highly subjective and inaccurate. Transmitted Beam Wavefront Profiling (TBWP) allows for the direct and quick imaging of the distortions introduced by bulk scattering, which is a direct manifestation of the presence of refractive index inhomogeneities in the PLM sample. As a laser beam propagates through the PLM sample, different regions of the incident beam experience different refractive index profiles, which cause spatial distortions to the beam. TBWP is able to directly and quickly image these distortions introduced to a propagating laser beam caused by the presence of bulk scattering in the PLMs.					Conference on Solid State Lasers XXIV - Technology and DevicesConference on Solid State Lasers XXIV - Technology and Devices	FEB 08-10, 2015FEB 08-10, 2015	SPIESPIE	San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0277-786X		978-1-62841-432-5	WOS:000353888400057

Assessment of optical quality and the identification of bulk scatter have been by simple visual inspection of thin samples of PLMs, thus making the measurements highly subjective and inaccurate.A modified white light Schlieren Imaging Setup utilizing variable focusing capability is demonstrated. The white light Schlieren Imaging Setup makes it possible to image the spatial variations in the refractive index in the PLMs regardless of dimensions, which are the cause of bulk scattering loss in a transparent material over the entire cross-sectional area of the sample. The high sensitivity of white light Schlieren provides the ability of directly imaging the local spatial variations in refractive index across the entire sample dimension and compare different samples.

WATER DEFICIT AND NITROGEN FERTILIZER EFFECTS ON NDVI OF 'TIFTON 85' BERMUDAGRASS DURING REGROWTH								APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE				31	1			97	102		10.13031/aea.31.10731			2015	2015	A better understanding of how bermudagrass (Cynodon spp.) regrowth is influenced by production inputs will aid in advancing precision management. The objectives were to evaluate the effect of irrigation and nitrogen (N) on normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI) during regrowth and evaluate the relationship between NDVI during regrowth to forage yield. Normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI) data were collected in an experiment evaluating two harvest schedules (four or eight week), four rates of irrigation (0, 4.2, 8.4, or 12.5 mm of water each irrigation event), and three rates of N (season total of 168, 336, and 504 kg N ha(-1)). Both irrigation and N influenced NDVI of bermudagrass during the regrowth periods of both the four- and eight-week harvest schedules, but there were no irrigation by N interactions. As was expected, regrowth (as measured by NDVI) in response to irrigation was dependent on the timing and duration of rain-free periods within the regrowth periods. Generally, NDVI increased with increasing N rate at most sampling dates. Regression slopes of yield versus NDVI measured near the end of the regrowth period were higher for the eight-week harvest schedule than for the four-week schedule. Within each harvest schedule, however; slopes were similar. The high correlation coefficients between NDVI late in the regrowth period and yield suggest NDVI is a useful tool for managing bermudagrass harvests.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0883-8542	1943-7838		WOS:000350844000011

Influence of spacer length and rigidity on properties of phosphonium polymers and on their supramolecular assembly with a conjugated polyelectrolyte								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C				3	17			4537	4544		10.1039/c4tc02576h			2015	2015	A series of seven cationic polymers have been prepared wherein the length of spacer between charge-bearing sites has been varied. Thermal stability of the polymers was characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The length of spacer has obvious effect on thermal stability as well as on the extent of crystallinity as revealed by X-ray powder diffraction. The cationic polymers were tested for their ability to form supramolecularly-assembled films with an anionic polythiophene derivative by a layer-by-layer (LbL) deposition process. Film growth was followed by spectroscopic techniques and surface morphologies were examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Interesting dependence of film morphology and composition was observed depending on whether an even-or odd-number of methylene spacers was present between charge-bearing sites.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2050-7526	2050-7534		WOS:000353769300042

No. GP-985, PI 672483) and PD 05041 (Reg. No. GP-986, PI 672484) are noncommercial breeding lines of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) jointly released by the USDA-ARS, the Clemson University Experiment Station, and Cotton Incorporated in 2014. PD 05035 was selected from a cross of PD 93007 and cultivar Sure-Grow 747, and PD 05041 from a cross of PD 93046 and Sure-Grow 747. PD 05035 and PD 05041 possess broad adaptation from California east to Virginia and display outstanding fiber quality properties significantly better than several commercial cultivars. Specifically, PD 05035 and PD 05041 possess outstanding fiber strength and length potential, while also maintaining micronaire values lower than commercial cultivars. PD 05035 and PD 05041 also display fiber spinning characteristics superior to commercial cultivars. Both germplasm lines possess an okra leaf shape, display mid-season maturity, and produce lint yields similar to or better than commercial cultivars. PD 05035 and PD 05041 are broadly adapted across the entire U.S. upland cotton production region. The combination of longer fiber length, stronger fiber strength, lower micronaire, improved fiber spinning characteristics, okra leaf shape, and broad adaptation make PD 05035 and PD 05041 valuable genetic resources to cotton breeding programs.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1936-5209	1940-3496		WOS:000352488000018

Electronic health records (EHRs) are being implemented in clinical practices throughout the USA yet it is not known whether they improve the quality of clinical notes. The goal in this study was to determine if EHRs improve the quality of outpatient clinical notes.Materials and methods A five and a half year longitudinal retrospective multicenter quantitative study comparing the quality of handwritten and electronic outpatient clinical visit notes for 100 patients with type 2 diabetes at three time points: 6 months prior to the introduction of the EHR (before-EHR), 6 months after the introduction of the EHR (after-EHR), and 5 years after the introduction of the EHR (5-year-EHR). QNOTE, a validated quantitative instrument, was used to assess the quality of outpatient clinical notes. Its scores can range from a low of 0 to a high of 100. Sixteen primary care physicians with active practices used QNOTE to determine the quality of the 300 patient notes.Results The before-EHR, after-EHR, and 5-year-EHR grand mean scores (SD) were 52.0 (18.4), 61.2 (16.3), and 80.4 (8.9), respectively, and the change in scores for before-EHR to after-EHR and before-EHR to 5-year-EHR were 18% (p<0.0001) and 55% (p<0.0001), respectively. All the element and grand mean quality scores significantly improved over the 5-year time interval.Conclusions The EHR significantly improved the overall quality of the outpatient clinical note and the quality of all its elements, including the core and non-core elements. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that the EHR significantly improves the quality of clinical notes.									4	0	0	1	1	5			1067-5027	1527-974X		WOS:000352771100021	25342178

A hierarchical Bayesian approach was applied to a statewide stream survey data set, in which Brook Trout detection probability was incorporated and statistical significance of environmental covariates was based on 95% credible intervals of estimated coefficients that did not overlap a value of zero. Forested land at the catchment scale was the most important covariate affecting Brook Trout occurrence; i.e., heavily forested catchments with corresponding low levels of developed and impervious land area were more likely to be occupied by Brook Trout. Coarse surficial geology (an indicator of groundwater potential) and stream slope had significantly positive effects on occurrence, whereas herbaceous plant cover and wetland and open water area had significantly negative effects. Catchmentscale and riparian-scale covariates were highly correlated in many instances, and no riparian-scale covariate was retained in the final model. Detection probability of Brook Trout at the stream-segment scale was high (mean, 0.85). Our model had a high predictive ability, and the mean value of receiver operating characteristic area under the curve was 0.80 across 100 leave-some-out iterations. The fine spatial grain of this study identified patches of suitable stream habitat for Brook Trout in Connecticut, particularly in the northwestern part. Our analysis revealed a more optimistic status of Brook Trout in Connecticut than did a coarser-grained analysis across the USA.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0002-8487	1548-8659		WOS:000352726200014

Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE					97						10.3791/52666			2015 Mar 19	2015	The basidiomycete Cryptococcus neoformans, an invasive opportunistic pathogen of the central nervous system, is the most frequent cause of fungal meningitis worldwide resulting in more than 625,000 deaths per year worldwide.Although electroporation has been developed for the transformation of plasmids in Cryptococcus, onlybiolisticdelivery providesan effective means to transformlinearDNAthat can be integrated into the genome by homologous recombination. Acetate has been shown to be a major fermentation product during cryptococcal infection, but the significance of this is not yet known.A bacterial pathway composed of the enzymes xylulose-5-phosphate/fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase (Xfp) and acetate kinase (Ack) is one of three potential pathways for acetate production in C. neoformans. Here, we demonstrate the biolistic transformation of a construct, which has the gene encoding Ack fused to the fluorescent tag mCherry, intoC. neoformans. We then confirm integration of the ACK-mCherry fusion into theACKlocus.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1940-087X		MEDLINE:25867491	25867491

A variety of force fields have thus far been demonstrated to capture and accumulate particles and cells in microfluidic devices, which, however, all take place within the region of microchannels and may potentially cause channel clogging. This work presents a new method for the electrokinetic preconcentration of 1 mu m-diameter polystyrene particles and E. coli cells in a very-low-conductivity medium inside a microfluidic reservoir. The entire microchannel can hence be saved for a post-concentration analysis. This method exploits the strong recirculating flows of induced-charge electroosmosis to concentrate particles and cells near the corners of the reservoir-microchannel interface. Positive dielectrophoresis is found to also play a role when small microchannels are used at high electric fields. Such an in-reservoir electrokinetic preconcentration method can be easily implemented in a parallel mode to increase the flow throughput, which may potentially be used to preconcentrate bacterial pathogens in water.									5	0	0	3	0	5			0003-2654	1364-5528		WOS:000352141800043	25742630

J	Galluch, Pamela S.; Grover, Varun; Thatcher, Jason Bennett								Interrupting the Workplace: Examining Stressors in an Information Technology Context								JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS				16	1			1	47					JAN 2015	2015	Contemporary information and communication technologies (ICTs) such as e-mail and instant messaging create frequent interruptions in the workday, which can potentially reduce business productivity and increase stress. However, we know little about how ICT-enabled interruptions cause stress and how individuals can use ICTs to cope with this stress. Using the transactional model of stress as the theoretical framework, we examines ICTs' influence on the stress process. We examine two demands that serve as stressors: quantity and content of ICT-enabled interruptions. These stressors influence perceptual stress, which then manifests into physical strain. To understand how to mitigate ICT-enabled stressors' influence, we examine three forms of control that potentially moderate demand's influence on the stress process: timing control, method control, and resource control. Timing control serves as a primary control, control that is present at the initial appraisal of an environment, while method control and resource control serve as coping behaviors, behaviors that individuals enact after they feel stressed. In order to rigorously assess the outcome variable, we used a non-invasive salivary technique to measure alpha-amylase, a hormone that is an objective indicator of strain. We used two laboratory experiments to test our model. In Experiment 1, we found that ICT-enabled demands served as stressors and led to perceptual stress and that ICT-enabled timing control negatively moderated the relationships between stressors and stress. In Experiment 2, we found that method control negatively moderated the relationship perceptual conflict had with strain, while increasing perceptual overload's relationship to strain. Resource control had the opposite finding: it negatively moderated perceptual overload's relationship with strain, while increasing perceptual conflict relationship with strain. The results provide insight into how ICTs create episodic stress and facilitate our ability to manage it. We conclude the paper with implications for research, methods, and practice.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1536-9323	1558-3457		WOS:000352136000001

In addition to its primary role of protecting the Ag thin film from oxidation, the incorporation of C-60 facilitated the achievement of a 30-fold enhancement in the emission intensity of rhodamine B (RhB) fluorophore. The high signal yield was attributed to the unique p-p interactions between C-60 thin films and RhB, which enabled efficient transfer of energy of RhB emission to Ag plasmon modes. Furthermore, minor variations in the C-60 film thickness yielded large changes in the enhancement and angularity properties of the SPCE signal, which can be exploited for sensing applications. Finally, the low-cost fabrication process of the Ag-C-60 thin film stacks render C-60 based SPCE substrates ideal, for the economic and simplistic detection of analytes.									8	0	0	0	0	8			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000352270700048	25785916

Similarly to other CNT foams, HCNT foams exhibit preconditioning effects in response to cyclic loading; however, their fundamental deformation mechanisms are unique. In quasistatic compression, HCNT foams exhibit strain localization and collective structural buckling, nucleating at different weak sections throughout their thickness. In dynamic compression, they undergo progressive crushing, governed by the intrinsic density gradient along the thickness of the sample. HCNT microbundles often undergo brittle fracture that originates from nanoscale defects. Regardless of this microstructural damage, bulk HCNT foams exhibit super-compressibility and recover more than 90% of large compressive strains (up to 80%). When subjected to striker impacts, HCNT foams mitigate impact stresses more effectively compared to other CNT foams comprised of non-helical CNTs (similar to 50% improvement). The unique mechanical properties we revealed demonstrate that the HCNT foams are ideally suited for applications in packaging, impact protection, and vibration mitigation.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2046-2069			WOS:000352091600062		
J	Chan, Melody; Glass, Darren; Macauley, Matthew; Perkinson, David; Werner, Caryn; Yang, Qiaoyu								SANDPILES, SPANNING TREES, AND PLANE DUALITY								SIAM JOURNAL ON DISCRETE MATHEMATICS				29	1			461	471		10.1137/140982015			2015	2015	Let G be a connected, loopless multigraph. The sandpile group of G is a finite abelian group associated to G whose order is equal to the number of spanning trees in G. Holroyd et al. used a dynamical process on graphs called rotor-routing to define a simply transitive action of the sandpile group of G on its set of spanning trees. Their definition depends on two pieces of auxiliary data: a choice of a ribbon graph structure on G, and a choice of a root vertex. Chan, Church, and Grochow showed that if G is a planar ribbon graph, it has a canonical rotor-routing action associated to it; i.e., the rotor-routing action is actually independent of the choice of root vertex. It is well known that the spanning trees of a planar graph G are in canonical bijection with those of its planar dual G*, and furthermore that the sandpile groups of G and G* are isomorphic. Thus, one can ask: are the two rotor-routing actions, of the sandpile group of G on its spanning trees, and of the sandpile group of G* on its spanning trees, compatible under plane duality? In this paper, we give an affirmative answer to this question, which had been conjectured by Baker.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0895-4801	1095-7146		WOS:000352224600029

Black Shank Resistance and Agronomic Performance of Flue-Cured Tobacco Lines and Hybrids Carrying the Introgressed Nicotiana rustica Region, Wz								CROP SCIENCE				55	1			79	86		10.2135/cropsci2014.02.0164			JAN-FEB 2015	2015	Black shank, caused by Phytophthora nicotianae, is one of the most important diseases affecting tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) production in the United States. Genetic mechanisms are needed that provide resistance to current races and that can be combined into cultivars that provide high yields of cured leaf with acceptable quality. Previous research identified DNA markers associated with an introgressed N. rustica genomic region (designated as Wz) found to contribute to resistance to race 0 and race 1 isolates. Objectives of the current research were to use DNA markers to transfer Wz into the elite genetic background of flue-cured tobacco cultivar K 326 and to develop nearly isogenic lines and hybrids with and without the race 0 immunity gene Php. These materials were evaluated in multiple environments for black shank resistance, yield, and quality characteristics. Wz was observed to positively affect resistance in the seven diverse disease environments tested. Genotypes in which Wz was combined with Php exhibited the greatest levels of resistance. No evidence of a negative relationship between Wz and yield and/or quality was observed. Data suggest commercial value for Wz in flue-cured tobacco-breeding programs with the goal of developing high-yielding tobacco cultivars with resistance to race 0 and race 1. Further studies are necessary to determine the durability of Wz-mediated resistance, however.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0011-183X	1435-0653		WOS:000351997300009		
J	Sweeney, J. A.; Jones, M. A.								Glufosinate Tolerance of Multiple WideStrike and Liberty-Link Cotton (Gosspyium hirsutum L.) Cultivars								CROP SCIENCE				55	1			403	410		10.2135/cropsci2014.03.0175			JAN-FEB 2015	2015	One option available to cotton (Gosspyium hirsutum L.) producers for control of glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine]-resistant (GR) weeds is the use of glufosinate [(2RS)-2-amino-4[ hydroxy(methyl)phosphinoyl]butyric acid] (Liberty 280SL, 24.5% [w/v] glufosinate-ammonium salt) in glufosinate-tolerant, transgenic cotton cultivars. A field experiment conducted in 2011 and 2012 in Florence, SC, examined the effects of glufosinate on the growth, lint yield, and fiber quality of WideStrike and Liberty-Link cotton cultivars. Five WideStrike cultivars and three Liberty-Link cultivars were sprayed topically at the 1- to 3-leaf stage and the 7- to 9-leaf stage with glufosinate at 0.59 kg ha(-1). Glufosinate-and weed-free plots were maintained as controls for each cultivar. Reduced plant health and increased leaf injury were observed in both Liberty-Link and WideStrike cultivars following glufosinate applications, but sprayed WideStrike cultivars displayed as much as 11% greater leaf injury than sprayed Liberty-Link cultivars. No differences in lint yield were found between sprayed WideStrike or Liberty-Link cultivars and their respective controls. However, averaged across all cultivars, lint yield of cotton sprayed with glufosinate was 105 kg ha-1 greater than unsprayed cotton. Yield increases of sprayed cotton appeared to be related to increased boll production at the first fruiting position and between nodes 11 and 15. Glufosinate had no effect on any fiber property evaluated. Cotton producers planting WideStrike or Liberty-Link cotton cultivars and using glufosinate at labeled rates can adequately control GR weeds without negatively affecting lint yield or fiber quality. Cotton producers may also possibly experience slight lint yield increases as a result of glufosinate application in WideStrike and Liberty-Link cotton cultivars.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0011-183X	1435-0653		WOS:000351997300041

Place Attachment and Marine Recreationists' Attitudes toward Offshore Wind Energy Development								JOURNAL OF LEISURE RESEARCH				47	2			263	284					2015	2015	Renewable energy initiatives are increasing and many locations selected for offshore wind farms are close to recreation resources. Public involvement processes to assess project support are standard in offshore wind energy planning. However, often missing from these assessments are investigations into subpopulations, such as marine recreationists. Using mixed methods, researchers evaluated a scale that measures marine recreationists' (n = 483) attitudes toward offshore wind energy. Researchers also examined the relationships between place attachment and opposition and support for the proposed projects. Results suggest that place attachment can assist in predicting attitudes toward offshore wind energy development, but the explanatory power and the nature of the relationships differed between two communities. Implications for communication, outreach, and recreation management are discussed.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0022-2216	2159-6417		WOS:000351020500005

Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) technology encompasses many diverse aspects. In this paper, we focus exclusively on the evolution of supervisory control strategies for on-board energy management in HEV. We present a series of control algorithms that have been developed in simulation and implemented in prototype vehicles for charge-sustaining HEV at OSU-CAR. These solutions span from fuzzy-logic control algorithms to more sophisticated model-based optimal control methods. Finally, methods developed for plug-in HEV energy management are also discussed.

Compared with conventional high-surface area carbon nanomaterials, electroactive conducting polymers (ECPs) exhibit an increase in energy density, which is attractive for next generation supercapacitor electrode materials. When designed with micro-and nanoscale dimensions, ECP electrodes display an increase in power density by decreasing the ion diffusion length in bulk electrodes. Here, we describe a template-free method for synthesizing polypyrrole microtubes on various stainless steel meshes with a process inherently scalable to large-area substrates. Microtube growth is governed by the nucleation of hydrogen gas at the mesh joints as a result of proton reduction at the platinum counter electrode. Depending on the size and spacing of the mesh wires and the substrate proximity to the working electrode, polypyrrole microtubes can be created with cylindrical and conical shapes with diameters ranging from 50-400 mu m and heights up to 1400 mu m. Polymer electrodes exhibiting cylindrical structures electrochemically grown with electrode potentials below 0.8 V exhibit excellent electrochemical performance comparable to thin polymer films. The process scalability is demonstrated using larger area substrates (up to 4 cm(2)) by carefully controlling the spacing between the working (substrate) and counter electrodes, which also provides an increase in microtube density from 350 cm(-2) to 560 cm(-2) without any loss in performance.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2046-2069			WOS:000351354000084

The oviposition behavior of Simulium dinellii (Joan) was observed near at Otun Quimbaya, Colombia. Small groups of females hovered about 2 cm above the water surface to oviposit. Some of these females had been capture and the eggs were obtained. These eggs were counted, measured and processed by scanning electron microscopy. Subtriangular eggs had a latticework of polygons on the endochorionic surface. Chorionic differences between the eggs of S. dinellii and the few previously studied species suggest potential taxonomic value of egg microstructure.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0120-548X	1900-1649		BCI:BCI201500295609

The physiological role of PRL in mammary glands is relatively certain while its role in breast tumor has been a topic of debate for over 20 years. In this review, the author attempts to briefly summarize the data coming from his laboratory in the past years, focusing on G129R, a PRL receptor (PRLR) antagonist developed by introducing a single amino acid substitution mutation into human PRL (hPRL) at position 129, and a variety of G129R derivatives. The author has proposed two novel ideas for potential use of PRL, not anti-PRL agents, as an adjuvant agent for breast cancer, making it a hormone of many faces.									3	0	0	1	0	3			0065-2598		978-3-319-12114-7; 978-3-319-12113-0	WOS:000350422800004	25472534

Journal of insect science (Online)				15							10.1093/jisesa/iev006			2015 Apr 05	2015	A 3-yr study (2009-2011) was conducted to examine the spatial and temporal dynamics of stink bugs in three commercial farmscapes. Study locations were replicated in South Carolina and Georgia, in an agriculturally diverse region known as the southeastern coastal plain. Crops included wheat, Triticum aestivum (L.), corn, Zea mays (L.), soybean, Glycine max (L.), cotton, Gossypium hirsutum (L.), and peanut, Arachis hypogaea (L.). Farmscapes were sampled weekly using whole-plant examinations for corn, with all other crops sampled using sweep nets. The predominant pest species of phytophagous stink bugs were the brown stink bug, Euschistus servus (Say), the green stink bug, Chinavia hilaris (Say), and the southern green stink bug, Nezara viridula (L.). Chi-square tests indicated a departure from a normal distribution in 77% of analyses of the variance to mean ratio, with 37% of slopes of Taylor's power law and 30% of coefficient beta of Iwao's patchiness regression significantly greater than one, indicating aggregated distributions. Spatial Analyses by Distance IndicEs (SADIE) indicated aggregated patterns of stink bugs in 18% of year-end totals and 42% of weekly counts, with 80% of adults and nymphs positively associated using the SADIE association tool. Maximum stink bug densities in each crop occurred when the plants were producing fruit. Stink bugs exhibited greater densities in crops adjacent to soybean in Barnwell and Lee Counties compared with crops adjacent to corn or fallow areas. The diversity of crops and relatively small size of fields in the Southeast leads to colonization of patches within a farmscape. The ecological and management implications of the spatial and temporal distribution of stink bugs within farmscapes are discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1536-2442		MEDLINE:25843577	25843577	
J	Zinzow, Heidi M.; Thompson, Martie								Factors Associated With use of Verbally Coercive, Incapacitated, and Forcible Sexual Assault Tactics in a Longitudinal Study of College Men								AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR				41	1			34	43		10.1002/AB.21567			JAN-FEB 2015	2015	Although verbally coerced and incapacitated sexual assaults are common, less is known about perpetrators of these incidents in comparison to perpetrators of forcible assaults. Furthermore, few studies have investigated factors that differentiate perpetrators who employ different forms of sexual assault tactics. The current study included 526 men who completed self-report inventories at the end of each of their four years in college. Measures assessed sexual assault tactics, demographics, incident characteristics, risky behavior, rape supportive beliefs and peer norms, antisocial traits, and childhood adversity. Perpetrators were grouped based on the most severe tactics reported over the course of 7 assessed time periods, with 13% in the verbal coercion group, 16% in the incapacitation group, and 5% in the forcible group. ANOVAs determined that the forcible group scored significantly higher than incapacitation and verbal coercion groups on risky behavior, rape supportive beliefs/norms, antisocial traits, and childhood adversity. The incapacitation group scored higher than the verbal coercion group on risky behavior. In a multinomial logistic regression analysis comparing tactic groups to non-perpetrators, all tactic groups scored significantly higher on risky behavior and rape supportive beliefs/norms, and the forcible group scored higher on antisocial traits and childhood adversity. Perpetrators in the forcible group had engaged in more repeat offenses, and perpetrators of both the incapacitated and forcible assaults were more likely to use alcohol before the incident. Findings highlight the need for interventions that are tailored to offense trajectories, alter rape supportive attitudes and peer norms, and decrease campus substance use.

Frequency and Costs of Hospital Transfers for Ambulatory Care-Sensitive Conditions								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE				21	1			51	59					JAN 2015	2015	ObjectivesNursing home (NH) patients are frequently transferred to emergency departments (EDs) and/or hospitalized in situations in which transfer might have been avoided. This study describes the frequency of NH transfers for ambulatory care-sensitive conditions (ACSCs) and estimates associated expenditures.Study DesignRetrospective cohort study of 62,379 NH patients with Medicare coverage receiving care in South Carolina between 2007 and 2009.MethodsSubjects were analyzed to determine the frequency of acute ED or hospital care for conditions. Comparison is made to similar patients transferred for acute treatment of non-ACSCs. Generalized linear models were used to estimate the costs attributable to treating ACSCs.ResultsOver 3 years, 20,867 NH subjects were transferred from NHs to acute care facilities, and 85.3% of subjects had at least 1 episode of care for an ACSC. An average of 13,317 subjects per year were transferred for an average of 17,060 episodes of ED or hospital care per year between 2007 and 2009. More ACSC patients transferred to EDs were subsequently admitted to the hospital (50.4% vs 25%; P < .0001). In adjusted analyses, mean ED costs per episode of care ($401 vs $294; P < .0001) were higher, but mean hospitalization costs per episode of care were lower ($8356 vs $10,226; P < .0001) for ACSC patients compared with non-ACSC patients.ConclusionsA significant proportion of Medicare NH patients are treated acutely for ACSCs, which are associated with higher healthcare utilization and costs. Better access to onsite evaluation might enable significant cost savings and reduce morbidity in this population.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1088-0224			WOS:000350965300013	25880150

Electrokinetic particle focusing has been demonstrated in constricted microchannels by the use of the constriction-induced dielectrophoresis. However, previous studies on this subject have been limited to Newtonian fluids only. We report in this paper an experimental investigation of the viscoelastic effects on electrokinetic particle focusing in non-Newtonian polyethylene oxide solutions through a constricted microchannel. The width of the focused particle stream is found NOT to decrease with the increase in DC electric field, which is different from that in Newtonian fluids. Moreover, particle aggregations are observed at relatively high electric fields to first form inside the constriction. They can then either move forward and exit the constriction in an explosive mode or roll back to the constriction entrance for further accumulations. These unexpected phenomena are distinct from the findings in our earlier paper [Lu et al., Biomicrofluidics 8, 021802 (2014)], where particles are observed to oscillate inside the constriction and not to pass through until a chain of sufficient length is formed. They are speculated to be a consequence of the fluid viscoelasticity effects. (c) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.									4	0	0	1	0	4			1932-1058			WOS:000350546900008	25713690	
J	Wang, Zhengxin; Marcus, R. Kenneth								Roles of Interstitial Fraction and Load Conditions on the Dynamic Binding Capacity of Proteins on Capillary-Channeled Polymer Fiber Columns								BIOTECHNOLOGY PROGRESS				31	1			97	109		10.1002/btpr.2013			JAN-FEB 2015	2015	Capillary-channeled polymer (C-CP) fibers are used as a stationary phase for ion-exchange chromatography of proteins. Collinear packing of the fibers permits operation at high linear velocities (U-o>100 mm s(-1)) and low backpressure (<2,000 psi) on analytical-scale columns. Rapid solvent transport is matched with very efficient solute mass transfer as fibers are virtually non-porous with respect to the size of the target protein molecules. Lack of porosity of course limits the equilibrium binding capacity of stationary phases. Breakthrough curves and frontal analysis are used to better understand trade-offs between the kinetic and thermodynamic properties as C-CP fibers are applied in preparative situations. Fiber columns packed to different interstitial fraction values affect both the total fiber surface area (e.g., equilibrium binding capacity [EBC]) and the permittivity to flow and mass transport characteristics (e.g., dynamic binding capacity [DBC]). The EBC of the nylon 6 C-CP fibers was found to be 1.30 mg g(-1), with isotherms that were best matched by a Moreau model, showing linearity up to solute concentrations of approximate to 0.4 mg mL(-1). Isotherms generated under flow conditions were equally well approximated using Langmuir, Freundlich, and Moreau isotherm models. Fairly linear responses were seen up to the maximum load concentration of 1.2 mg mL(-1). Counterintuitively, dynamic studies revealed that conditions of high column porosity yielded a DBC that is approximate to 70% higher than the EBC. These findings point to potential advantages in terms downstream processing applications, where protein throughput and yield are critical metrics.

An Exploration of the Nightstand and Over-the-Bed Table in an Inpatient Rehabilitation Hospital								HERD-HEALTH ENVIRONMENTS RESEARCH & DESIGN JOURNAL				8	2			43	55		10.1177/1937586714565612			JAN 2015	2015	Objective: This study seeks to determine where patients in a rehabilitation hospital keep the greatest percentage of their belongings, that is, in/on the nightstand or on the over-the-bed table. Background: This study provides an inventory of patient items located on the over-the-bed table and in/on the nightstand. Understanding the functions of furnishings within the patient room is key for future preparation for designing a next-generation over-the-bed table or for redesigning a more useful nightstand. Methods: The contents on the top of the nightstand; the contents in the top, middle, and bottom drawers of the nightstand; items next to the nightstand; and the contents on the over-the-bed table within patient rooms were inventoried and placed into categories using similar, patient item categories as the Brooks et al. (2011) study, which examined the contents of the nightstand and the over-the-bed table in assisted living and skilled nursing facilities. Results: Overall, patients in a rehabilitation hospital had a greater percentage of their belongings on the top of the nightstand as compared to their belongings located in all three combined drawers of the nightstand. Overall, patients had a greater percentage of their belongings located on the over-the-bed table as compared to their belongings located on the nightstand. Conclusions: Tabletop surface area was used extensively in patient rooms at a rehabilitation hospital, but nightstand drawers were underutilized.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1937-5867	2167-5112		WOS:000350414800006	25816380

Greater selectivity has been realized through the functionalization of the PP fibers through the physical adsorption of commercially available head group-modified poly(ethylene glycol) lipids (PEG-lipids), where the head group is chosen to affect affinity separations. We refer to this general surface modification methodology as lipid tethered ligands (LTLs). In this study, LTLs were synthesized by solid phase synthesis. In comparison to the commercial PEG-lipids, the synthesized LTLs contain no chemically labile phosphate groups. Instead of an ester linkage in the commercial lipids, amide functionality was used in the synthesized LTLs to attach the lipids and ligands. By use of fluorescence imaging of FITC-labeled LTLs, the synthesized LTL was shown to be superior to the commercial LTL in terms of the adsorption efficiency to PP C-CP fibers, the resistance to solvent wash from the PP C-CP fibers, and their chemical stability under acidic, neutral and basic conditions. The PP C-CP fibers functionalized with a synthesized LTL that was biotinylated at the head group are shown to be capable of capturing streptavidin from E. coli cell lysate more efficiently than the PP C-CP fibers functionalized with the commercial biotinylated PEG-lipid. The functionalization of PP C-CP fibers with the synthesized LTLs is a simple, but highly efficient, method to generate novel stationary phases with a variety of functionalities for solid phase extraction and liquid chromatography.									9	0	0	5	0	9			0003-2654	1364-5528		WOS:000349837200020	25619845	
J	Pierre, Matthew E. St.; Banerjee, Salil; Hoover, Adam W.; Muth, Eric R.								The effects of 0.2 Hz varying latency with 20-100 ms varying amplitude on simulator sickness in a helmet mounted display								DISPLAYS				36				1	8		10.1016/j.displa.2014.10.005			JAN 2015	2015	The relationship between the occurrence of simulator sickness (SS) and varying latency in a helmet-mounted display (HMD) was explored in this study. Previous work has always considered latency to be a constant. The aim of this research was to determine if a latency that varied over time would impact the experience of SS for HMD users. An object location task was used while viewing real, live video scenes via HMD. A planned comparisons approach was utilized with four experimental conditions, 2 of them having constant latency (0 ms added to system baseline, 200 ms added to system baseline) and 2 of them having sinusoidally varying latency (100 ms amplitude at 0.2 Hz frequency, and 20-100 ms varying amplitude at 0.2 Hz frequency). These conditions allowed for the assessment of the effects of constant latency vs. varying latency on the experience of SS. The results indicated that a varying latency is associated with greater experience of SS among HMD users than constant latency. Results also indicated, as has other recent research, that added constant latency on its own does not appear to be associated with the experience of higher levels of SS in an HMD.

We hypothesize that silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) will associate with proteins common to human serum and cell culture media forming a PC that will impact cell activation and cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the role of scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) in mediating this toxicity was evaluated. Citrate-suspended 20 nm AgNPs were incubated with human serum albumin (HSA), bovine serum albumin (BSA), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or water (control) to form a PC. AgNPs associated with each protein (HSA, BSA, and HDL) forming PCs as assessed by electron microscopy, hyperspectral analysis, zeta-potential, and hydrodynamic size. Addition of the PC decreased uptake of AgNPs by rat lung epithelial and rat aortic endothelial cells. Hyperspectral analysis demonstrated a loss of the AgNP PC following internalization. Cells demonstrated concentration-dependent cytotoxicity following exposure to AgNPs with or without PCs (0, 6.25, 12.5, 25 or 50 mu g/ml). All PC-coated AgNPs were found to activate cells by inducing IL-6 mRNA expression. A small molecule SR-BI inhibitor was utilized to determine the role of SR-BI in the observed effects. Pretreatment with the SR-BI inhibitor decreased internalization of AgNPs with or without PCs, and reduced both cytotoxicity and IL-6 mRNA expression. This study characterizes the formation of a PC on AgNPs and demonstrates its influence on cytotoxicity and cell activation through a cell surface receptor.									18	1	0	12	0	19			1096-6080	1096-0929		WOS:000350101700015	25326241

Recently, the number of annual bluegrass populations resistant to these herbicides has increased on golf courses. Previous research involving annual bluegrass resistance to ALS inhibitors has included elucidating the mechanism of resistance and in vivo response of ALS to ALS-inhibiting herbicides. The purpose of this research was to generate baseline information on enzymatic parameters of resistant (R) and susceptible (S) annual bluegrass biotypes and further distinguish these biotypes by comparing vegetative growth and reproductive characteristics. The R biotype contained a mutation in the ALS gene resulting in a Trp(574) to Leu amino acid substitution. Compared to the S biotype, the R biotype exhibited a 27- and 10-fold resistance to trifloxysulfuron at the whole-plant level and under in vitro conditions, respectively. No significant differences were observed in substrate concentration at one-half maximum rate of enzyme activity (pyruvate) or extractable ALS activity between biotypes, but the maximum rate of enzyme activity was higher for the R biotype. The feedback inhibition of ALS activity by the branched-chain amino acids was higher for the R biotype than the S biotype, with leucine, valine, and isoleucine inhibiting ALS activity 20, 6, and 4% more in the R biotype, respectively. The R biotype produced more inflorescences and seeds per plant in comparison with the S biotype, but relative growth rates between biotypes were similar at all harvest intervals. Our research provides baseline information regarding ALS enzyme response, vegetative growth, and reproductive characteristics of annual bluegrass biotypes resistant and susceptible to ALS-inhibiting herbicides.Nomenclature: Trifloxysulfuron; annual bluegrass, Poa annua L.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0043-1745	1550-2759		WOS:000349782100001		
J	Thies, Judy A.; Buckner, Sharon; Horry, Matthew; Hassell, Richard; Levi, Amnon								Influence of Citrullus lanatus var. citroides Rootstocks and Their F1 Hybrids on Yield and Response to Root-knot Nematode, Meloidogyne incognita, in Grafted Watermelon								HORTSCIENCE				50	1			9	12					JAN 2015	2015	Southern root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne incognita) are an important re-emerging pest of watermelon in the United States and worldwide. The re-emergence of root-knot nematodes (RKNs) in watermelon and other cucurbits is largely the result of the intensive cultivation of vegetable crops on limited agricultural lands coupled with the loss of methyl bromide for pre-plant soil fumigation, which has been the primary method for control of RKNs and many soilborne diseases of cucurbits and other vegetable crops for several decades. One alternative for managing RKN in watermelon is the use of resistant rootstocks for grafted watermelon. We have developed several RKN-resistant Citrullus lanatus var. citroides lines (designated RKVL for Root-Knot Vegetable Laboratory), which have shown promise as rootstocks for grafted watermelon. In 2011 and 2012, we demonstrated that F1 hybrids derived from our selected RKVL lines exhibited resistance to RKN that was equal to or greater than that of the parental RKVL lines when grown in fields highly infested with M. incognita. In 2011, although significant differences were not observed among rootstocks, the F1 hybrids produced slightly higher yields compared with the selected parental lines. Among the selected parental lines, RKVL 318 produced high yields in both years. In 2011, three of four RKVL parental lines and all four of their F1 hybrids produced greater (P < 0.05) fruit yields than self-grafted `Tri-X 313', 'Emphasis' bottle gourd, and 'Strong Tosa' squash hybrid. In 2012, three RKVL F1 hybrid lines produced higher yields than the selected parents. Overall, these F1 hybrids were vigorous and should provide useful genetic material for selection and development of robust RKN-resistant C. lanatus var. citroides rootstock lines.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0018-5345	2327-9834		WOS:000348626100002

To fully characterize DNA binding modes for these complexes of the formulae [M(clotri)(2)Cl-2]center dot nH(2)O (1-4), [M(clotri)(2)Br-2]center dot nH(2)O (5,6), [M(clotri)(3)NO3]NO3 center dot nH(2)O (9), and [M(clotri)(3)(NO3)(2)] (10), circular dichroism (CD) and linear dichroism (LD) spectroscopy, UV melting experiments, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and ethidium bromide (EtBr) displacement methods were used. Results indicate mixed electrostatic interactions, possibly through groove binding, that result in accretion and coiling of DNA. Electrochemical studies indicate that the Cu2+ complex 9 readily reduces to the reactive-oxygen-species-generating Cu+, which oxidatively damages DNA. There is a subtle correlation between log P values, calculated electrostatic potentials, and cytotoxicity of the complexes. The extent of cell-nucleus DNA-metal adduct formation in the HeLa cervix-uterine carcinoma cell line does not necessarily correlate with cytotoxicity, indicating that the nature of DNA lesions may be crucial to activity.									3	0	0	1	0	3			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000349668200020	25561277

Although these cells have been known to be primarily involved in thrombosis and hemostasis, platelets and thrombocytes have been shown recently to have roles in inflammatory functions and the immune response in general. Thrombocytes/platelets are widely recognized contributors to inflammatory responses upon stimulation with various microbial stimulants. In recent years, the role of platelets has been shown in adaptive immune responses. Therefore, thrombocytes/platelets should be considered as specialized immune cells that not only resemble innate effector cells in function but also have a role in affecting adaptive immunity through cellular contact and interaction with antigen presenting cells and lymphocytes.

This article, using a stable and bounded sample of repeat purchase of American works created before 1950, reveals that this tact has reduced hammer prices for that art. However, renewed and hyper-competitive efforts to bring more and higher quality art to market by the two main houses, Sotheby's and Christie's, have resulted in general profitability.

To better understand the chemical fate of ENPs in aquatic environments, solubility of CeO2 NPs was investigated using batch dissolution experiments as a function of pH (1.65-12.5), [phosphate] and particle size (33 and 78 nm). It was found that CeO2 dissolution was only significant at pH < 5 and inversely proportional to surface area. After 120 h, the release of Ce was 3 times greater in large NPs than that in small NPs that is likely contributed by the difference in exchangeable Ce(III) impurity (small: 0.3 mM kg(-1), large: 1.56 mM kg(-1)). When 100 mu M of phosphate was added, the dissolution rate of CeO2 NPs was decreased in small NPs by 15% at pH 1.65 and 75% at pH 4.5 and in large NPs by 56% at pH 1.65 and 63% at pH 4.5. The inner-sphere surface complexation of P that is revealed by the zeta potential measurements is effectively suppressing the CeO2 NP dissolution. Predicting the fate and transport of CeO2 NPs in aquatic environment, pH and P ligands might play important roles in controlling the solubility of CeO2 NPs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, rice flour lacks gluten that forms a cohesive dough structure in wheat-based noodles and for gluten-free, rice-based noodle formulations an alternative to gluten is needed. Therefore, the effects of the addition of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) as a replacement for gluten and the temperature of the water used for rice noodle preparation were investigated. Rice noodle contained high-viscosity HPMC (6%) had the smallest breakdown and the largest setback viscosity, also had better texture and sensory properties. The use of dough water at 80 degrees C was effective on reducing the cooking loss and improving the textural properties. The overall acceptability score was higher compared to that of the control. The results showed that using high-viscosity HPMC (6%) to replace gluten and kneading with water at 80 degrees C was the most effective protocol for improving the quality of gluten-free rice noodles.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1344-6606			WOS:000349580200017

Amphibians, specifically salamanders, are particularly susceptible to the effects of changing climates due to their restrictive physiological requirements and low vagility; however, little is known about which landscapes and species are vulnerable to climate change. Our study objectives included, (1) evaluating species-specific predictions (based on 2050 climate projections) and vulnerabilities to climate change and (2) using collective species responses to identify areas of climate refugia for conservation priority salamanders in the northeastern United States. All evaluated salamander species were projected to lose a portion of their climatic niche. Averaged projected losses ranged from 3%-100% for individual species, with the Cow Knob Salamander (Plethodon punctatus), Cheat Mountain Salamander (Plethodon nettingi), Shenandoah Mountain Salamander (Plethodon virginia), Mabee's Salamander (Ambystoma mabeei), and Streamside Salamander (Ambystoma barbouri) predicted to lose at least 97% of their landscape-scale climatic niche. The Western Allegheny Plateau was predicted to lose the greatest salamander climate refugia richness (i.e., number of species with a climatically-suitable niche in a landscape patch), whereas the Central Appalachians provided refugia for the greatest number of species during current and projected climate scenarios. Our results can be used to identify species and landscapes that are likely to be further affected by climate change and potentially resilient habitats that will provide consistent climatic conditions in the face of environmental change.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1999-4907			WOS:000348403700001

Furthermore, growing interest in decreasing our dependence on petroleum necessitates the development of safe and efficient energy storage for transportation. Li-ion batteries have emerged as the premier candidate to meet these demands; however, such systems are limited by thermal hazards (runaway reactions, fires, explosions), which become increasingly dangerous in large-format batteries. We have developed an electrolyte system comprising poly(ethylene oxide), an ionic liquid and lithium salt that exhibits an intrinsic mechanism for inhibiting device operation when the temperature increases beyond a given threshold, which is attributed to polymer-ionic liquid phase separation. In the following article, we describe how the thermally activated phase separation causes a decrease in ion conductivity, thereby affecting the concentration of ions at the electrode, in addition to an increase in charge transfer resistance from the formation of a polymer coating on the porous electrode. Such mixtures provide a transformative approach to regulating electrochemical processes, which is necessary to achieve inherently safe operation of large format Li-ion batteries.									3	0	0	0	0	3			2050-7488	2050-7496		WOS:000349447200096

Disparate arthropod groups have adapted to these widespread and taxonomically diverse plants, yet their interactions with glandular hosts rarely are incorporated into broad ecological theory. Ecologists and entomologists might be unaware of even well-documented examples of insects that are sticky-plant specialists. The hemipteran family Miridae (more specifically, the omnivorous Dicyphini: Dicyphina) is the best-known group of arthropods that specializes on sticky plants. In the first synthesis of relationships-with glandular plants for any insect family, we review mirid interactions with sticky hosts, including their adaptations (behavioral, morphological, and physiological) and mutualisms with carnivorous plants, and the ecological and agricultural implications of mirid-sticky plant systems. We propose that mirid research applies generally to tritrophic interactions on trichome-defended plants, enhances an understanding of insect-plant interactions, and provides information useful in managing crop pests.									9	0	0	9	0	9			0066-4170		978-0-8243-0160-6	WOS:000348560200022	25564742

Hurricane wrack generates landscape-level heterogeneity in coastal pine savanna								ECOGRAPHY				38	1			63	73		10.1111/ecog.00731			JAN 2015	2015	Wrack (vegetation debris) deposited by storm surges of major hurricanes along the northern Gulf of Mexico produces depressant effects that vary from partial to complete mortality of groundcover vegetation in coastal savannas. As wrack decomposes or is relocated by a subsequent hurricane, patches are opened to colonization. We postulated that patterns of wrack deposition and removal, coupled with differential responses by savanna plant species should produce alternate states of groundcover vegetation. We explored extreme effects of wrack deposited by Hurricane Katrina (2005) in savannas dominated by slash pine Pinus elliottii and cordgrass Spartina patens and located above mean high tide at the Grand Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, Mississippi, USA. In 2008, we established plots in adjacent areas with and without wrack deposits. Almost no groundcover plant species occurred in wrack deposits compared to adjacent groundcover without wrack. We simulated redistribution of wrack during a new storm surge by removing wrack from replicated plots and depositing it in plots without wrack, recording plant species in treatment and control plots before, then one month and one year after manipulations. One year later, about half the species present before wrack addition (especially dominant graminoids) grew back through redistributed wrack, suggesting that some species were resistant to burial of limited amounts of wrack. Wrack removal resulted in germination and establishment of numerous herbaceous plant species not in undisturbed groundcover, doubling total aboveground numbers of species in the pine savanna and shifting groundcover communities to alternate states not present prior to Katrina. Removal of wrack opens space colonized by resilient species, including those transported in wrack and those surviving intervals between disturbances belowground. Wrack dynamics (deposition and removal) generated alternate states that resulted from resistance- and resilience-driven changes in different patches of groundcover in coastal savannas.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0906-7590	1600-0587		WOS:000348763100007

As compared to the findings of Isik (2010), who previously investigated the short-and long-run relationships between GR and NGC using a bivariate model, we find that the magnitude of the coefficient estimate of NGC become substantially smaller in the long-run and the sign of short-run estimate of NGC shift to negative after accounting for capital and labor as well. In addition to that covered by Isik (2010), we investigate the direction of causality between GR and NGC using the vector error correction model Granger causality approach, and reveal the evidence of feedback hypothesis for Turkey.									6	0	0	1	0	6			1556-7249	1556-7257		WOS:000348532800004

We described the host-use pattern and sexual dimorphism of P. valdiviensis to test for monogamy considering that the few other studied species of Pinnixa White inhabit their respective hosts as male-female pairs. Against expectations, P. valdiviensis lived either solitarily, or in small groups of up to four individuals; only a few burrows were inhabited by two crabs (either male-female or female-female pairs). The observations above argue against the notion that P. valdiviensis is monogamous. Furthermore, that a high frequency of solitary females were found brooding embryos and that the population sex ratio was skewed toward females suggests that males might roam among hosts in search of receptive females. We argue in favour of additional long-term (seasonal, >1 year) descriptive and experimental studies to reveal the mating tactics used by both males and females of P valdiviensis. We also examined individual-level reproductive parameters in the studied species as little is known about reproduction in symbiotic crabs. Fecundity varied between 383 and 1052 eggs crab(-1) with a mean +/- SD of 774 +/- 160 eggs crab(-1) and increased significantly with female body size. Embryo volume varied between 0.0169 and 0.0443 with a mean SD of 0.0222 +/- 0.0063 mm(3) and did not vary with female body size. Reproductive output (RU) represented a mean +/- SD of 5.74% +/- 0.86% of crab body dry weight and increased proportionally with crab body weight. The RU in P. valdiviensis is lower than that reported for other free-living and symbiotic crabs.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0278-0372	1937-240X		WOS:000349135000009

The purpose of this study is to examine the transnational practices of second-generation immigrants, specifically their leisure activities. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 26 second-generation Chinese-Americans on their immigrant background and transnational leisure experience. Findings revealed two distinct patterns in their transnational leisure: 1) the contrast between "traditional" versus "contemporary," and 2) the progression from "ways of being" to "ways of belonging".									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-2216	2159-6417		WOS:000348622900006

While many materials exhibit excellent optical limiting performance at a relatively higher fluence (>9 J/cm(2)), there is a still a dearth of optical limiting materials for protecting low damage threshold (<1 J/cm(2)) photonic devices. Although metal nanoparticle-decorated graphene hybrids are expected to resolve this issue, the rehybridization of metal d-orbitals and graphene p-orbitals often lead to undesirable changes in graphene's electronic structure which adversely affect the nonlinear optical performance. Here, we demonstrate that d-orbitals of Au nanoparticles exhibit little or no rehybridization with graphene and result in an enhanced optical limiting behavior at a low fluence of similar to 0.4 J/cm(2), which is lower than most metal decorated graphene, carbon nanotube nanocomposites and metal nanoparticles. This optical limiting performance at a lower fluence is attributed to the excellent photo-absorption of Au nanoparticles combined with rapid thermalization of excited carriers by graphene.

Through encapsulation of an f-block metal atom/ion with 12 valence electrons, the bare C-20 cage with the D-2h point group could be stabilized to a highly symmetrical I-h structure. The calculated values of HOMO-LUMO energy gaps using the B3lYP and BHHLYP functionals ranged from 2.22 to 5.39 eV and from 3.89 to 7.95 eV, respectively. The stability of these metal-encapsulated clusters can be attributed to the 32-electron rule, where the central metal atom's orbitals strongly participated in the t(2u), g(u), t(1u), h(g), and a(g) valence molecular orbitals.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000349005900042	25579200

Functionalization can be used to bring about greater selectivity through surface modification. PET fibers were treated with ethylenediamine to generate primary amine groups on the fiber surface, enabling subsequent covalent attachment of ligands. The ninhydrin test for primary amines revealed surface densities of 13.9-60.0 mu mol m(-2) for PET fibers exposed for periods of 3-12 min. Here, 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid was linked to the EDA-treated PET fiber surface as a hydrophilic spacer, and then d-biotin was attached on the end of the spacer as an affinity ligand. The streptavidin binding capacity and binding homogeneity were studied on the biotin-functionalized PET C-CP fiber microbore column. The selectivity of the biotin surface functionalization was assessed by spiking lysate with Texas Red-labeled streptavidin and enhanced green fluorescent protein. Greater than 99 % selectivity was realized. This ligand-coupling strategy from standard solid-phase peptide synthesis used in stationary phase functionalization creates great potential for PET C-CP fiber-packed HPLC columns to perform a variety of chromatographic separations.									8	0	0	4	0	8			1618-2642	1618-2650		WOS:000348435600030	25410640

Stone-Lewbel (SL) price indices for commodity groups are constructed using information on the budget shares and the Consumer Price Indices (CPIs) of the goods comprising the commodity groups, which allows for household-level prices to be recovered. This study evaluates how susceptible are elasticities and marginal effects estimates from traditional parametric demand systems to the CPI used in the construction of the SL prices. To do this, three alternative regional CPIs are considered for the construction of the SL prices: monthly, quarterly and a constant (unity) price index. Elasticities and marginal effect estimates are computed for eight food commodity groups using the Exact Affine Stone Index (EASI) model as the parametric demand system and data from the United States Consumer Expenditure Survey. The estimates proved to be robust to the alternative regional CPIs considered in the construction of SL price indices, even to the absence of one. Hence, the results suggest that it is possible to accurately estimate a demand system even in the absence of price information.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0003-6846	1466-4283		WOS:000348711800003

However, problems arise when exposure times are extended to longer-term cultures on the order of days. To assess the effect of resazurin over longer incubation times, MCF7 (HTB-22), MCF10A (CRL-10317), 3T3-L1 (CL-173), and D1 (CRL-12424) cultures were tested with varying amounts of resazurin over 4- and 8-day periods. MCF7, 3T3-L1, and D1 cells cultured for 8 days with 20 % alamarBlue(A (R)) had significantly less cell survivability. Specifically, levels of metabolic activity, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) concentration, and glucose consumption of the cell lines cultured for 8 days in medium with 20 % alamarBlue(A (R)) were significantly lower (p < 0.05) than metabolic activity, DNA concentration, and glucose consumption of MCF7 cells cultured for 8 days in medium with no alamarBlue(A (R)). MCF7, 3T3-L1, and D1 cells used less glucose at concentrations as low as 5 %. Data also suggests the toxic effects are more pronounced in the cancerous cell line as compared to the noncancerous cells.									1	0	0	0	1	2			0920-9069	1573-0778		WOS:000347948200002	24242827

Interactive relationship between basement-membrane development and sarcomerogenesis in single cardiomyocytes								EXPERIMENTAL CELL RESEARCH				330	1			222	232		10.1016/j.yexcr.2014.08.020			JAN 1 2015	2015	The cardiac basement membrane (BM), the highly organized layer of the extracellular matrix (ECM) on the external side of the sarcolemma, is mainly composed of laminin and collagen IV, which assemble a dense, well-organized network to surround the surface of each adult cardiomyocyte. The development of the cardiac BM plays a key role in organogenesis of the myocardium through interactions between sarcomeres and integrins. Because of the complicated structure of cardiac muscle fibers and lack of a proper investigation method, the detailed interactions among BM development, sarcomeric growth, and integrin expression remain unclear. In this study, freshly isolated 3-day neonatal cardiomyocytes (CMs) were cultured on aligned collagen, which mimics the in vivo ECM structure and induces neonatal CMs to grow into rod-like shapes. Then double fluorescence-immunostained laminin and alpha-actinin or integrin beta 1 on neonatal CMs cultured 4-72 h were imaged using a confocal microscope, and the spatial relationship between laminin deposition and alpha-actinin expression was evaluated by colocalization analysis. At 4 h, laminin was deposited around Z-bodies (dot-shaped alpha-actinin) and integrins; from 18-to-72 h, its gradual colocalization with Z-lines (line-shaped alpha-actinin) and integrins increased Pearson's coefficient; this indicates that development of the BM network from the neonatal stage to adulthood is closely related to sarcomeric formation via integrin-mediated interactions.

In both years, RICN infection was severe in 'Emphasis' bottle gourd, 'Strong Tosa' hybrid squash, and wild tinda rootstocks with galling of the root system ranging from 86% to 100%. In 2009, the RKVL wild watermelon rootstocks exhibited lower (P < 0.05) percentages of root galling (range 9% to 16%) than non-grafted `Tri-X 313' (41%), 'Emphasis', 'Strong Tosa', and the wild tinda rootstocks. The grafted wild watermelon rootstock RKVL 318 produced more (PS 0.05) fruit (12 per plot) than all other entries (mean = five per plot), and it produced a heavier (PS 0.05) fruit yield (29.5 kg per plot) than all entries except self-grafted `Tri-X 313' (21.5 kg per plot). In 2010, soil in half of the plots was treated with methyl bromide (50%):chloropicrin (50%) (392 kg.ha(-1)) before planting. The RKVL wild watermelon rootstocks exhibited resistance to RKN with percentages of root system galled ranging from 11% for RKVL 316 to 56% for RKVL 301 in the untreated control plots. Fruit yields in the untreated plots were 21.9, 25.6, and 19.9 kg/plot for RICVL 301, RKVL 316, and RICVL 318, respectively. Yields were greater (P <= 0.05) for the three RICVL rootstocks than for 'Strong Tosa' (3:0 kg) and `Ojakkyo' wild watermelon rootstock (2.8 kg) in the untreated plots. Yields of watermelon grafted on 'Strong Tosa' were nearly seven times greater (P <= 0.05) in the methyl bromide-treated plots than in the untreated plots. In contrast, yields of RICVL 316 and RKVL 318 were similar in both treatments and the yield of RICVL 301 was less (P <= 0.05) in the methyl bromide-treated plots than in the untreated plots. The three RKVL wild watermelon rootstock lines exhibited resistance to RKN. RKVL 316 had low root galling and produced the heaviest fruit yield and greatest numbers of fruit of any rootstock evaluated in 2010. The RKVL lines should be useful sources of RKN resistance for rootstocks for grafted watermelon.									3	0	0	2	0	3			0018-5345	2327-9834		WOS:000348626100001

Merle; Tadmor, Yaakov; Levi, Amnon								Potential Sources of Whitefly (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) Resistance in Desert Watermelon (Citrullus colocynthis) Germplasm								HORTSCIENCE				50	1			13	17					JAN 2015	2015	Selection for and incorporation of host plant resistance into cultivars is a fundamental strategy to control insects and diseases and may help reduce reliance on synthetic pesticides. The sweetpotato whitefly, Beinisia tabaci (Gennadius), is an important pest of watermelon [Citrullus lanatus (Thunberg) Matsum. and Nakai var. lanatus] and is among the most damaging pests in many agricultural systems worldwide. Citrullus colocynthis L., a perennial melon species indigenous to arid regions of northern Africa, the Mediterranean region, and southwestern Asia, is a valuable source of resistance to insect pests and diseases of watermelon. Laboratory and greenhouse experiments were conducted to evaluate selected C. colocynthis genotypes for sources of resistance to B. tabaci. Thirty genotypes of C. colocynthis, collected in different geographic regions, were evaluated against the heirloom cultivar Calhoun Gray using first a horizontal Y-tube olfactometer in the laboratory. A selected subset of the genotypes was evaluated in a second experiment in the laboratory using a vertical monitoring assay. In this assay, whiteflies could freely move upward to feed and oviposit on leaves placed in the upper portion of a Y-tube. In a third experiment, a choice assay was conducted on selected genotypes in cages in the greenhouse. Of the 30 C. colocynthis genotypes evaluated, PI 346082 (collected in Afghanistan) exhibited the highest level of resistance against B. tabaci based on all three experiments. PI 537277 (collected in Pakistan) exhibited a significantly high level of whitefly resistance based on low survival of adult whiteflies and a low ratio of nymphs to eggs. P1346082 and PI 537277 should be a useful source for breeding projects aiming to improve whitefly resistance in watermelon cultivars.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0018-5345	2327-9834		WOS:000348626100003

Liquid Sampling-Atmospheric Pressure Glow Discharge as a Secondary Excitation Source for Laser Ablation-Generated Aerosols: Parametric Dependence and Robustness to Particle Loading								APPLIED SPECTROSCOPY				69	1			58	66		10.1366/14-07585			JAN 2015	2015	Liquid sampling-atmospheric pressure glow discharge (LS-APGD) microplasma is being developed as a secondary vaporization-excitation source for the optical emission analysis of laser ablation (LA)-generated particle populations. The practicalities of this coupling are evaluated by determining the influence of source parameters on the emission response and the plasma's robustness upon LA introduction of easily ionized elements (EIEs). The influence of discharge current (45-70 mA), LA carrier gas flow rate (0.1-0.8 L min(-1)), and electrode separation distance (0.5-3.5 mm) was studied by measuring Cu emission lines after ablation of a brass sample. Best emission responses were observed for high-discharge currents, low He carrier gas flow rates, and relatively small (<1.5 mm) electrode gaps. Plasma robustness and spectroscopic matrix effects were studied by monitoring Mg(II): Mg(I) intensity ratios and N-2-derived plasma rotational temperatures after the ablation of Sr- and Ca-containing pellets. Plasma robustness investigations showed that the plasma is not appreciably affected by the particle loadings, with the microplasma being slightly more ionizing in the case of Ca introduction. In neither case did the concentration of the concomitant element change the robustness values, implying a high level of robustness. Introduction of the LA particles results in slight increases in the rotational temperatures (similar to 10% relative), with Ca-containing particles having a greater effect than Sr-containing particles. The observed variation of 9% in the plasma rotational temperature is in the same order of magnitude as the short-term reproducibility determined by the proposed LA-LS-APGD system. The determined rotational temperatures ranged from 1047 to 1212 K upon introducing various amounts of Ca and Sr. The relative immunity to LA particle-induced matrix effects is attributed to the relatively long residence times and high power densities (>10 W mm(-3)) of the LS-APGD microplasma.									3	0	0	2	0	3			0003-7028	1943-3530		WOS:000347745300008	25506884

The minimum integer k such that a graph G has a t-tone k-coloring is known as the t-tone chromatic number. We study the 2-tone chromatic number in three different graph products. In particular, given graphs G and H, we bound the 2-tone chromatic number for the direct product G x H, the Cartesian product G square H, and the strong product G boxed times H.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1234-3099	2083-5892		WOS:000348252000005

While the multiscale nature of hydrogeologic problems is widely recognized, technological limitations in computation and characterization restrict most practical modeling efforts to fairly coarse representations of heterogeneous properties and processes. For some modern problems, the necessary level of simplification is such that model parameters may lose physical meaning and model predictive ability is questionable for any conditions other than those to which the model was calibrated. Recently, there has been broad interest across a wide range of scientific and engineering disciplines in simulation approaches that more rigorously account for the multiscale nature of systems of interest. In this article, we review a number of such approaches and propose a classification scheme for defining different types of multiscale simulation methods and those classes of problems to which they are most applicable. Our classification scheme is presented in terms of a flowchart (Multiscale Analysis Platform), and defines several different motifs of multiscale simulation. Within each motif, the member methods are reviewed and example applications are discussed. We focus attention on hybrid multiscale methods, in which two or more models with different physics described at fundamentally different scales are directly coupled within a single simulation. Very recently these methods have begun to be applied to groundwater flow and transport simulations, and we discuss these applications in the context of our classification scheme. As computational and characterization capabilities continue to improve, we envision that hybrid multiscale modeling will become more common and also a viable alternative to conventional single-scale models in the near future.									10	0	0	0	0	10			0017-467X	1745-6584		WOS:000347981800010	24628122

Using expectancy theory and climate to explain stakeholder participation, its direction and intensity								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT				33	1			3	14		10.1016/j.ijproman.2014.03.003			JAN 2015	2015	Expectancy theory explains motivation on the degree to which an effort is perceived to lead to performance, performance leads to rewards, and the rewards offered are desirable. In this article, we draw on expectancy theory along with psychological and organizational climate research to understand whether and to what degree stakeholders will participate in the implementation of project management systems and complimentary software technologies. We contend that psychological and organizational climate influence perceptions relevant to expectancy, that in turn determine: a) whether or not stakeholders will participate in a project, b) whether they will help or harm the project, and c) whether a stakeholder is motivated to complete these actions. Data for the article is from three in-depth case studies. Results support that stakeholders assess the direction and strength of the psychological climate and that their assessments shape their motivation to participate in active support, token support, or counter-implementation actions.

The Influence of Roles and Organizational Fit on Accounting Professionals' Perceptions of their Firms' Ethical Environment								JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS				126	1			125	141		10.1007/s10551-013-1996-4			JAN 2015	2015	A public accounting firm's ethical environment has an important role in encouraging ethical behavior, but prior research has shown that firm leaders (e.g., partners) perceive the ethical environment of their firms to be stronger than do non-leaders (Bobek et al. J Bus Ethics 92(4): 637-654, 2010). This study draws on several research streams in management to investigate the reasons behind this discrepancy. Our online questionnaire was completed by 139 accounting professionals. We find that when non-leader accounting professionals believe that they have a meaningful role in shaping and maintaining the ethical environment and/or have strong organizational fit with the accounting firm, they are more likely to perceive the ethical environment as strong and to perceive it similarly to firm leaders. That is, differences in leaders' and non-leaders' perceptions of the ethical environment are mediated by non-leaders' perceptions of their role in participating in shaping and maintaining the ethical environment of their firms. Further, we find that among firm leaders, a stronger public interest orientation (i.e., feeling a responsibility to serve the public interest) and a higher frequency of receiving mentoring are both associated with stronger perceptions of the ethical environment. Overall, our study is one of the first to directly test potential explanations for why firm leaders and non-leaders can have disparate views of a firm's ethical environment. In addition, these findings provide practical feedback to practitioners on actions they can take to improve perceptions of their firms' ethical environment.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0167-4544	1573-0697		WOS:000347950400014

We present a computational biology method where only the transcriptome needs to be measured and is used to derive a set of parameters for deterministic kinetic models of metabolic pathways. The technology is called Transcriptome-To-Metabolome (TTM) biosimulations, currently under commercial development, but available for non-commercial use by researchers. The simulated results on metabolites of 30 primary and secondary metabolic pathways in rice (Oryza sativa) were used as the biomarkers to predict whether the transcriptome was from a plant that had been under drought conditions. The rice transcriptomes were accessed from public archives and each individual plant was simulated. This unique quality of the TTM technology allows standard analyses on biomarker assessments, i.e. sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, accuracy, receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curve and area under the ROC curve (AUC). Two validation methods were also used, the holdout and 10-fold cross validations. Initially 17 metabolites were identified as candidate biomarkers based on either statistical significance on binary phenotype when compared with control samples or recognition from the literature. The top three biomarkers based on AUC were gibberellic acid 12 (0.89), trehalose (0.80) and sn1-palmitate-sn2-oleic-phosphatidylglycerol (0.70). Neither heat map analyses of transcriptomes nor all 300 metabolites clustered the stressed and control groups effectively. The TTM technology allows the emergent properties of the integrated system to generate unique and useful Omics' information.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1435-8603	1438-8677		WOS:000347707900008	24985701

Insights from the macrogenome								BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY				114	1			163	183		10.1111/bij.12403			JAN 2015	2015	Organisms with vast distributions often represent geographical mosaics of cryptic species. The black fly Simulium (Wilhelmia) lineatum is among the most widely distributed members of the family Simuliidae, ranging from the British Isles to eastern China. Rather than viewing S.lineatum as a possible aggregate of multiple species, taxonomists have suggested a more inclusive taxon with additional synonyms. Accordingly, S.lineatum is an ideal candidate for testing the hypothesis that a wide geographical distribution signals the presence of more than one species. A cytogenetic approach was used to probe the macrogenome of S.lineatum and other taxa proposed by taxonomists as conspecific. The banding patterns in the polytene chromosomes of 480 larvae from 15 countries across the Palearctic Region revealed 128 rearrangements of the complement. All rearrangements were autosomal and 89% were inversions nonrandomly distributed among species and among chromosome arms. The analyses clarify long-standing confusion over previously proposed names and reveal a longitudinal succession of four species sequentially replacing one another from west to east: Simulium lineatum s.s., Simulium balcanicum, Simulium turgaicum, and Simulium takahasii. Thus, S.turgaicum is recalled from synonymy and the other three species are validated. Within the most-represented species, S.balcanicum, the frequency of inversions follows a longitudinal gradient with a north-south bias; as the distance between the sites increases along this north-west-south-east axis, the similarity of inversion frequencies between sites decreases. Validation of the concept that broadly distributed black flies are composites of structurally similar species provides a framework for guiding discovery of additional biodiversity.(c) 2014 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2014, 114, 163-183.									4	0	0	4	0	4			0024-4066	1095-8312		WOS:000347836000013

The ceramic's mechanical properties were measured, and the phase composition and microstructure observed using X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The results show that the mechanical properties of the ceramic were initially improved on addition of LaMgAl11O19, but further additions were detrimental. When the amount of LMA added was equal to 2 wt.%, the bending strength and fracture toughness reached 812 +/- 37 MPa and 14.0 +/- 0.3 MPa.m(1/2). This equates to an increase of 8.0% and 6.9% compared with untreated 3 mol% yttria partially stabilized zirconia (3YSZ) ceramic, respectively. However, the bending strength and fracture toughness both decreased when the amount of LaMgAl11O19 added was 4 and 6 wt.%. A crack propagation and force analysis of the crack tips in LaMgAl11O19-platelet-reinforced 3YSZ ceramic were also carried out. The results indicate that phase transformation and crack deflection were the dominant toughening mechanisms in the LaMgAl11O19-3YSZ ceramic. At the same time, energy dissipation by the LaMgAl11O19 platelets also helps to restrain crack propagation in the matrix, which improves toughness more effectively.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1546-542X	1744-7402		WOS:000347716800021		
J	Giumetti, Gary W.; Schroeder, Amber N.; Switzer, Fred S., III								Forced Distribution Rating Systems: When Does "Rank and Yank" Lead to Adverse Impact?								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY				100	1			180	193		10.1037/a0037191			JAN 2015	2015	Despite widespread use of forced distribution rating systems (FDRSs), the potential for this performance appraisal method to lead to adverse impact (AI) in a layoff context has yet to be examined empirically. Thus, the current study uses a Monte Carlo simulation to examine the likelihood of encountering AI violations when an FDRS is used in the context of layoffs. The primary research questions included an examination of how AI violations change depending on the definition of the employment action (i.e., retention vs. layoff), the length of the repeated layoffs, and whether or not laid off employees are replaced each year. The current study also examined the impact of the size of the organization, the percentage of the workforce laid off, and the type of AI calculation method used on the likelihood of AI violations. Results suggest that defining the employment action as layoffs (rather than as retentions) may result in a greater likelihood of AI violations, and AI violations are likely to peak in the 1st year of use. Further, replacing laid off employees may result in higher levels of AI over time as compared with not replacing layoffs. Additionally, the greatest risk for AI occurs when the organization size is large (i.e., N = 10,000) and when certain AI calculation methods are used. Results are discussed in terms of their practical and legal implications for organizations.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0021-9010	1939-1854		WOS:000347729700011	24933572

A two-step real-time PCR assay was used to evaluate the expression of stress and virulence genes in E. coli O157:H7 heat shocked in compost at 47.5 degrees C for 10 min. Heat-shocked E. coli O157:H7 in compost was isolated by using an immunomagnetic bead separation method, followed by total RNA extraction, which was then converted to cDNA by using a commercial kit. E. coli O157:H7 heat shocked in broth served as the media control. In compost, heat shock genes (clpB, dnaK, and groEL) and the alternative sigma factor (rpoH) of E. coli O157:H7 were upregulated (P < 0.05), whereas the expression of trehalose synthesis genes did not change. Virulence genes, such as stx(1) and fliC, were upregulated, while genes stx(2), eaeA, and hlyA were down-regulated. In the toxin-antitoxin (TA) system, toxin genes, mazF, hipA, and yafQ were upregulated, whereas among antitoxin genes, only dinJ was upregulated (P<0.05). In tryptic soy broth, all heat shock genes (rpoH, clpB, dnaK, and groEL) were upregulated (P < 0.05), and most virulence genes (stx(1), stx2, hlyA, and fliC) and TA genes (mazF-mazE, hipA-hipB, and yafQ-dinJ and toxin gene chpS) were down-regulated. Our results revealed various gene expression patterns when E. coli O157:H7 inoculated in compost was exposed to a sublethal temperature. Clearly, induction of the heat shock response is one of the important protective mechanisms that prolongs the survival of pathogens during the composting process. In addition, other possible mechanisms (such as the TA system) operating along with heat shock response may be responsible for the extended survival of pathogens in compost.									4	0	0	4	0	4			0362-028X	1944-9097		WOS:000348012000005	25581175

TRANSPORTATION				42	1			25	43		10.1007/s11116-014-9521-x			JAN 2015	2015	How do emotions like happiness, pain, stress, sadness and fatigue vary during travel and by travel mode? Understanding the relationship between how we travel and how we feel offers insight into ways of improving existing transportation services, prioritizing investments and theorizing and modeling the costs and benefits of travel. Drawing on the American Time Use Survey's well-being module, which surveyed over 13,000 respondents about mood during randomly selected activities, we address these questions using pooled ordinary least squares and fixed-effects panel regression. Controlling for demographics and other individual-specific attributes, we find that, contrary to the common perception that travel is an onerous, derived demand, mood is generally no worse during travel than on average. However, compared to other influences, travel has only a small total impact on how we feel. The estimated relationship between mood and mode tends to be weak and often not statistically significant. Nevertheless, we find that bicyclists have the most positive affect. Next happiest are car passengers, and then car drivers, though when controlling for the pleasure typically derived from interacting with others drivers are at least as happy as passengers. Bus and train riders experience the most negative emotions, though a small part of this can be attributed to the fact that transit is disproportionately used for the unloved work trip. Our findings suggest that bicycle use may have benefits beyond the typically cited health and transportation ones, and that improving transit riders' emotional experience may be as important as improving traditional service features such as headways and travel speeds. Our findings are ambiguous as to whether the joy of driving will limit the appeal of autonomous vehicles.									10	0	0	0	0	10			0049-4488	1572-9435		WOS:000347536200004

Adsorption depends upon the physicochemical properties of the adsorbates and CNTs as well as the background water chemistry. Among all properties reported in the literature, no parameter was reported as solely controlling SOC adsorption by CNTs. In this article, these contributing parameters were reviewed and the associated explanations were discussed.

Seventeen optical and 23 NIR spectra were obtained from 10 days before (-10d) to 10 days after (+10d) the time of maximum B-band brightness. The relative strengths of absorption features and their patterns of development can be compared at one day intervals throughout most of this period. Carbon is not detected in the optical spectra, but we identify C I lambda 1.0693 in the NIR spectra. Mg II lines with high oscillator strengths have higher initial velocities than other Mg II lines. We show that the velocity differences can be explained by differences in optical depths due to oscillator strengths. The spectra of SN 2014J show that it is a normal SN Ia, but many parameters are near the boundaries between normal and high-velocity subclasses. The velocities for OI, Mg II, Si II, S Ca a, and Fell suggest that SN 2014J has a layered structure with little or no mixing. That result is consistent with the delayed detonation explosion models. We also report photometric observations, obtained from -10d to +29d, in the UBVRIJH and K-s bands. The template fitting package SNooPy is used to interpret the light curves and to derive photometric parameters. Using R-v = 1.46, which is consistent with previous studies, SNooPy finds that A(v) = 1.80 for E(B - V)(host) = 1.23 +/- 0.06 mag. The maximum B-band brightness of -19.19 +/- 0.10 mag was reached on February 1.74 UT +/- 0.13 days and the supernova has a decline parameter, Delta m(15), of 1.12 +/- 0.02 mag.									28	1	0	0	0	29			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000347245100036

Mrk 876 displays such a line at 4.80(-0.04)(+0.05) rest-frame energy. A possible interpretation of its origin can be found in the hotspot scenario. In this scenario, the primary radiation from a flare in the hot corona of an AGN illuminates a limited portion of the accretion disk that emits by fluorescence. In this context, the line can represent an extreme gravitationally redshifted Fe line originating on the accretion disk below six gravitational radii from a rotating supermassive black hole. The correct estimate of the line significance requires a dedicated approach. Based on an existing rigorous approach, we have performed extensive Monte Carlo simulations. We determine that the line is a real feature at a similar to 99% confidence level.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2041-8205	2041-8213		WOS:000347462300014

Nonvolatile optically-erased colloidal memristors								NANOSCALE				7	4			1270	1279		10.1039/c4nr05167j			2015	2015	A nonconjugated methacrylate terpolymer containing carbazole moieties (electron donors), 1,3,4-oxadiazole moieties (electron acceptors), and Coumarin-6 in the pendant groups was synthesized via free radical copolymerization of methacrylate monomers containing the respective functional groups. The terpolymer was formed into 57 nm particles through a mini-emulsion route. For a thin 100 nm film of the fused particles sandwiched between an indium-tin oxide (ITO) electrode and an Al electrode, the structure behaved as a nonvolatile flash (rewritable) memory with accessible electronic states that could be written, read, and optically erased. The device exhibited a turn-on voltage of ca. -4.5 VDC and a 106 current ratio. A device in the ON high conductance state could be reverted to the OFF state with a short exposure to a 360 nm light source. The development of semiconducting colloidal inks that can be converted into electroactive devices through a continuous processing method is a critical step in the widespread adoption of these 2D manufacturing technologies for printed electronics.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000347374600002	25338314

Phylogeny and evolution of Staphyliniformia and Scarabaeiformia: forest litter as a stepping stone for diversification of nonphytophagous beetles								SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY				40	1			35	60		10.1111/syen.12093			JAN 2015	2015	The beetle series Staphyliniformia exhibits extraordinary taxonomic, ecological and morphological diversity. To gain further insight into staphyliniform relationships and evolution, we reconstructed the phylogeny of Staphyliniformia using DNA sequences from nuclear 28S rDNA and the nuclear protein-coding gene CAD for 282 species representing all living families and most subfamilies, a representative sample of Scarabaeiformia serving as a near outgroup, and three additional beetles as more distant outgroups. Under both Bayesian inference (BI) and maximum likelihood inference (MLI), the major taxa within Staphyliniformia are each monophyletic: (i) Staphylinoidea, (ii) Hydrophiloidea s.l., and the contained superfamilies (iii) Hydrophiloidea s.s. and (iv) Histeroidea, although Staphylinoidea and Hydrophiloidea s.l. are not strongly supported by MLI bootstrap. Scarabaeiformia is monophyletic under both methods of phylogenetic inference. However, the relative relationships of Staphylinoidea, Hydrophiloidea s.l. and Scarabaeiformia differ between BI and MLI: under BI, Staphyliniformia and Scarabaeiformia were sister groups; under MLI, Hydrophiloidea s.l. and Scarabaeiformia were sister groups and these together were sister to Staphylinoidea. The internal relationships in Scarabaeiformia were similar under both methods of phylogenetic inference, with Cetoniinae, Dynastinae+Rutelinae, Hybosoridae, Passalidae, Scarabaeidae and Scarabaeinae recovered as monophyla. Histeridae comprised two major clades: (1) Abraeinae, Trypanaeine and Trypeticinae; and (2) Chlamydopsinae, Dendrophilinae, Haeteriinae, Histerinae, Onthophilinae, Saprininae and Tribalinae. The relationships among early-divergent Hydrophiloidea differed between BI and MLI, and overall were unresolved or received only moderate to low nodal support. The staphylinoid families Agyrtidae, Hydraenidae and Ptiliidae were recovered as monophyletic; the latter two were sister taxa, and Staphylinidae+Silphidae was also monophyletic. Silphidae was placed within Staphylinidae in close relation to a subset of Tachyporinae. Pselaphinae and Scydmaeninae were both recovered within Staphylinidae, in accordance with recent analyses of morphological characters, although not always with recently proposed sister taxa. None of the four major groups of Staphylinidae proposed by Lawrence and Newton (1982) was recovered as monophyletic. Certain highly specialized staphyliniform habits and morphologies, such as abdominal defensive glands and reduced elytra, have arisen in parallel in separate lineages. Further, our analyses support two major transitions to an aquatic lifestyle within Staphyliniformia: once within Staphylinoidea (Hydraenidae), and once within Hydrophiloidea s.l. (Hydrophiloidea s.s.). On a smaller scale, the most common transition is from litter to subcortical or to periaquatic microhabitats and the next most common is from litter to carrion and to fungi. Overall, transitions to periaquatic microhabitats were the most numerous. The broad picture in Staphyliniformia seems to be a high level of evolutionary plasticity, with multiple possible pathways to and from many microhabitat associations, and litter as a major source microhabitat for diversification. In Scarabaeiformia, the most common transitions were from litter to foliage, with flowers to litter, litter to flowers, and litter to dung being next, and then litter to roots, logs or carrion. Litter is again the largest overall source microhabitat. The most common transitions were to foliage and flowers.It thus seems that the litter environment presents ecological and evolutionary opportunities/challenges that facilitate entry of Staphyliniformia and Scarabaeiformia into new' and different ecological adaptive zones.									20	0	0	19	0	23			0307-6970	1365-3113		WOS:000347453400005		
J	Zinzow, Heidi M.; Thompson, Martie								A Longitudinal Study of Risk Factors for Repeated Sexual Coercion and Assault in US College Men								ARCHIVES OF SEXUAL BEHAVIOR				44	1			213	222		10.1007/s10508-013-0243-5			JAN 2015	2015	The purpose of the current study was to understand the prevalence, severity, and predictors of repeated sexual coercion and assault (SCA) in a non-criminal sample. Participants were 795 college men who were surveyed at the end of each of their 4 years in college. Participants completed self-report inventories once per year for 4 years. Measures assessed demographics, adverse childhood experiences, offense characteristics, antisocial personality characteristics, attitudes towards women and forced sex, perceived social norms, sexual behavior, and substance use. Results indicated that, among the 238 participants who reported at least once incident of SCA, 68 % engaged in repeated SCA, with repeat offenders engaging in aggressive acts of higher severity that began at an earlier age. A multinomial logistic regression model compared single and repeat offenders to non-perpetrators. Both single and repeat offenders endorsed more risky behaviors and sexually aggressive beliefs than non-perpetrators. Single offenders were higher on childhood adversity than non-perpetrators and repeat offenders were higher on antisocial personality traits than non-perpetrators. A second multivariate model compared single offenders to repeat offenders. Repeat offenders scored higher than single offenders on risky behaviors, sexually aggressive beliefs, and antisocial traits. Findings highlight the high prevalence of repeated SCA in young adults, the need for interventions that decrease rape supportive attitudes and risky substance use, and the importance of expanding models of sexual recidivism to include multiple risk factors.									7	0	0	1	0	7			0004-0002	1573-2800		WOS:000346861200021	24567167	
J	Calomeni, Alyssa J.; Rodgers, John H., Jr.								Evaluation of the utility of six measures for algal (Microcystis aeruginosa, Planktothrix agardhii and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata) viability								ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY				111				192	198		10.1016/j.ecoenv.2014.09.033			JAN 2015	2015	Standard algal toxicity tests are used to discern responses of algae to a variety of exposures including pesticides, personal care products and complex mixtures such as runoff and effluents. There are concerns regarding the accuracy, precision and utility of algal viability measures used as endpoints in algal toxicity test protocols. To definitively evaluate six algal viability measures, algae were heat-treated to produce known live:dead cell ratios. Cultures of two prokaryotic algae (Microcystis aeruginosa and Planktothrix agardhii) and a eukaryotic alga (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata) were boiled for five minutes and mixed after cooling with untreated cultures to produce suspensions of 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% live algal cells. Optical microscopy was used to assess the viability of algae on a cell-by-cell basis by measuring cell density, uptake of a vital stain (neutral red) and exclusion of a mortal stain (erythrosin b). Aggregate measures of algal cell viability included chlorophyll a concentrations, pheophytin a concentrations and respiration (measured as 2-(p-iodophenyl)-3-(p-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyl tetrazolium formazan absorbance (INT)). Cell densities, erythrosin b stained cells and chlorophyll a concentrations correlated with viable M. aeruginosa, P. agardhii and P. subcapitata cells (R-2=0.97-0.78, 0.98-0.85 and 0.99-0.97 respectively). Pheophytin a concentrations and neutral red stained cells did not correlate with viable algae (R-2=0.41-0.01 and 0.15-0.03 respectively). For INT formazan absorbance, 50%, 75% and 100% viable algae had greater variances and did not strongly correlate (R-2=0.75-0.54). This result was likely confounded by respiration associated with resident bacteria. Three of the six methods provided accurate and precise information regarding the viability of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic algae. These methods also have a relatively low initial expense and can be used widely. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.									3	0	0	2	0	3			0147-6513	1090-2414		WOS:000347267800026	25450933

Optimization of Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) Process for Maximum Ballistic Limit in MIL A46100 Steel Welded All-Metal Armor								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				24	1			229	244		10.1007/s11665-014-1274-3			JAN 2015	2015	Our recently developed multi-physics computational model for the conventional gas metal arc welding (GMAW) joining process has been upgraded with respect to its predictive capabilities regarding the process optimization for the attainment of maximum ballistic limit within the weld. The original model consists of six modules, each dedicated to handling a specific aspect of the GMAW process, i.e., (a) electro-dynamics of the welding gun; (b) radiation-/convection-controlled heat transfer from the electric arc to the workpiece and mass transfer from the filler metal consumable electrode to the weld; (c) prediction of the temporal evolution and the spatial distribution of thermal and mechanical fields within the weld region during the GMAW joining process; (d) the resulting temporal evolution and spatial distribution of the material microstructure throughout the weld region; (e) spatial distribution of the as-welded material mechanical properties; and (f) spatial distribution of the material ballistic limit. In the present work, the model is upgraded through the introduction of the seventh module in recognition of the fact that identification of the optimum GMAW process parameters relative to the attainment of the maximum ballistic limit within the weld region entails the use of advanced optimization and statistical sensitivity analysis methods and tools. The upgraded GMAW process model is next applied to the case of butt welding of MIL A46100 (a prototypical high-hardness armor-grade martensitic steel) workpieces using filler metal electrodes made of the same material. The predictions of the upgraded GMAW process model pertaining to the spatial distribution of the material microstructure and ballistic limit-controlling mechanical properties within the MIL A46100 butt weld are found to be consistent with general expectations and prior observations.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1059-9495	1544-1024		WOS:000347030600026		
J	Gallagher, Colin M.; Fisher, Thomas J.								ON WEIGHTED PORTMANTEAU TESTS FOR TIME-SERIES GOODNESS-OF-FIT								JOURNAL OF TIME SERIES ANALYSIS				36	1			67	83		10.1111/jtsa.12093			JAN 2015	2015	Recent work in the literature has shown weighted variants of the classic portmanteau test for time series can be more powerful in many situations. In this article, we study the asymptotic distribution of weighted sums of the squared residual autocorrelations where both the sample size n and maximum lag of the statistic m grow large. Several weighting schemes are introduced, including a data-adaptive statistic in which the weights are determined by a function of the sample partial autocorrelations. These statistics can provide more power than other portmanteau tests found in the literature and are much less sensitive to the choice of the maximum correlation lag. The efficacy of the proposed methods is further demonstrated through an analysis of Australian red wine sales.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0143-9782	1467-9892		WOS:000346983400005

J	Adams, Warren P.; Sherali, Hanif D.								RLT insights into lift-and-project closures								OPTIMIZATION LETTERS				9	1			19	39		10.1007/s11590-014-0763-5			JAN 2015	2015	This paper examines relationships between the two methods for constructing polyhedral outer-approximations of mixed 0-1 linear programs known in the literature as the level-1 Reformulation-Linearization-Technique (RLT) and the elementary closure of lift-and-project (L&P) cuts based on the level-1 L&P. The latter can be obtained, via a transformation of variables, as a relaxed version of the former through the removal of constraints. Whereas both approaches derive formulations in lifted spaces by scaling problem constraints with suitable multipliers, a key difference is that the multipliers used by the RLT are defined in terms of the binary variables of the given problem. As a consequence, these multipliers, in contrast to those used in the L&P, portend important advantages, including the ability to handle nonlinear expressions, to recognize redundant inequalities, and to exploit special structures. This paper compares the two methods, and uses RLT constructs to provide insights into the L&P approach. Some particular insights are illustrated on the quadratic assignment and MAX-2SAT problems, with level-2 RLT and level-2 L&P comparisons also given for the latter problem.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1862-4472	1862-4480		WOS:000347247800002

Anaerobic antimicrobial therapy was defined by antibiotic exposure on the first day of NEC. We matched (1: 1) infants exposed to anaerobic antimicrobial therapy with infants who were not exposed by using a propensity score stratified by NEC severity (medical and surgical). The primary composite outcome was in-hospital death or intestinal stricture. We assessed the relationship between anaerobic antimicrobial therapy and outcome by using a conditional logistic regression on the matched cohort.RESULTS: A total of 1390 infants exposed to anaerobic antimicrobial therapy were matched with 1390 infants not exposed. Mean gestational age and birth weight were 27 weeks and 946 g, respectively, and were similar in both groups. We found no significant difference in the combined outcome of death or strictures, but strictures as a single outcome were more common in the anaerobic antimicrobial therapy group (odds ratio 1.73; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-2.72). Among infants with surgical NEC, mortality was less common with anaerobic antimicrobial therapy (odds ratio 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.52-0.95).CONCLUSIONS: Anaerobic antimicrobial therapy was not associated with the composite outcome of death or strictures but was associated with an increase in intestinal strictures. This higher incidence of intestinal strictures may be explained by the fact that death is a competing outcome for intestinal strictures, and mortality was slightly lower in the anaerobic cohort. Infants with surgical NEC who received anaerobic antimicrobial therapy had lower mortality.									5	1	0	3	0	6			0031-4005	1098-4275		WOS:000347172200016	25511117

In this paper, the authors introduce both the shearing effect and flattening effect on the tunnel cross section, which was caused by the longitudinal differential settlement, into an existing analytical model of jointed shield tunnels. An example is then presented to illustrate the variation of the circumferential behavior of segmental lining, including both the structure safety and serviceability, along the longitudinal position. Finally, a series of parametric studies are performed to investigate how factors such as tunnel longitudinal settlement, property of surrounding ground, and the design parameters of segmental lining affect the circumferential behavior of the segmental lining.

To justify the use of these simulations for decision making, however, it is critical to determine, and when necessary mitigate, the biases and uncertainties in model predictions, a task that invariably requires validation experiments. To use experimental resources efficiently, validation experiments must be designed to achieve the maximum possible increases in model predictive ability through the calibration of the model against experiments. This need for efficiency is addressed by the concept of optimally designing validation experiments, which constitutes optimizing a predefined criterion while selecting the settings of experiments. This paper presents an improved optimization criterion that incorporates two important factors for the optimal design of validation experiments: (1) how well the model reproduces the validation experiments, and (2) how well the validation experiments cover the domain of applicability. The criterion presented herein selects the appropriate settings for future experiments with the goal of achieving a desired level of predictive ability in the computer model through the use of a minimal number of validation experiments. The criterion explores the entirety of the application domain by including the effect of coverage, and exploits areas of the domain with high variability by including the effect of empirically defined discrepancy bias. The effectiveness of this new criterion is compared with two well-established criteria through a simulated case study involving the stress-strain response and textural evolution of polycrystalline materials. The proposed criterion is demonstrated as efficient at improving the predictive capabilities of the numerical model, particularly when the amount of experimental data available for validation is low.

The properties investigated include the setting time and calcium hydroxide depletion of rice husk ash (RHA) pastes; microstructure and flow behavior of RHA mortars; strength and durability of RHA concretes. Results from this investigation suggested that the URHA and ground RHA (GRHA) mixtures performed better than the control mixtures in all tests conducted except water demand and setting time. The URHA mixture revealed denser microstructure compared to the control mixture. The internal porosity created by the coarse RHA grains in the matrix and their inability to completely participate in pozzolanic reaction may be the reasons for the poorer performance of the URHA mixture than compared to the GRHA mixture. The effect of grinding the RHA to finer fractions either substantially or slightly improved all properties except final setting time. With the performance of the GRHA concrete somewhat similar to that of the SF concrete, the use of ground RHA can be concluded to provide acceptable performance in portland cement systems.

Drawing inspiration from these natural structures, a novel materials processing method, known as magnetic freeze casting, is used to fabricate helix-reinforced hybrid composites. The ZrO2-epoxy composites investigated here exhibit enhanced torsional properties due their helical architectural organization. In torsion, the maximum tensile and compressive stresses induced by a state of pure shear are oriented at 45 to the axis of rotation. As a result, the composites with helix-reinforcement oriented parallel to the direction of maximum compressive stress (at similar to 45 degrees) exhibit the highest shear moduli. Bioinspired, hybrid composites with helix-reinforced structures may be useful for a variety of engineering applications, from the cylindrical shafts in combustion engines to golf clubs and bone implants.

J	Cheng, Junzilan; Fowler, John; Kempf, Karl; Mason, Scott								Multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problems with non-preemptive activity splitting								COMPUTERS & OPERATIONS RESEARCH				53				275	287		10.1016/j.cor.2014.04.018			JAN 2015	2015	In this paper, we explore the difference between preemption and activity splitting in the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) literature and identify a new set of RCPSPs that only allows non-preemptive activity splitting. Each activity can be processed in multiple modes and both renewable and non-renewable resources are considered. Renewable resources have time-varying resource constraints and vacations. Multi-mode RCPSP (MRCPSP) with non-preemptive activity splitting is shown to be a generalization of the RCPSP with calendarization. Activity ready times and due dates are considered to study the impact on project makespan. Computational experiments are conducted to compare optimal makespans under three different problem settings: RCPSPs without activity splitting (P1), RCPSPs with non-preemptive activity splitting (P2), and preemptive RCPSPs (P3). A precedence tree-based branch-and-bound algorithm is modified as an exact method to find optimal solutions. Resource constraints are included into the general time window rule and priority rule-based simple heuristics are proposed to search for good initial solutions to tighten bounding rules. Results indicate that there are significant makespan reductions possible when non-preemptive activity splitting or preemptions are allowed. The higher the range of time-varying renewable resource limits and the tighter the renewable resource limits are, the bigger the resulting makespan reduction can be. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Liu, Guoxin; Shen, Haiying; Ward, Lee								An Efficient and Trustworthy P2P and Social Network Integrated File Sharing System								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTERS				64	1			54	70		10.1109/TC.2013.201			JAN 2015	2015	Efficient and trustworthy file querying is important to the overall performance of peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing systems. Emerging methods are beginning to address this challenge by exploiting online social networks (OSNs). However, current OSN-based methods simply cluster common-interest nodes for high efficiency or limit the interaction between social friends for high trustworthiness, which provides limited enhancement or contradicts the open and free service goal of P2P systems. Little research has been undertaken to fully and cooperatively leverage OSNs with integrated consideration of proximity and interest. In this work, we analyze a BitTorrent file sharing trace, which proves the necessity of proximity-and interest-aware clustering. Based on the trace study and OSN properties, we propose a social network integrated P2P file sharing system with enhanced efficiency and trustworthiness (SOCNET) to fully and cooperatively leverage the common-interest, proximity-close, and trust properties of OSN friends. SOCNET uses a hierarchical distributed hash table (DHT) to cluster common-interest nodes, then further cluster proximity-close nodes into a subcluster, and connects the nodes in a subcluster with social links. Thus, when queries travel along trustable social links, they also gain higher probability of being successfully resolved by proximity-close nodes, and it simultaneously enhances efficiency and trustworthiness. We further propose different strategies to guide nodes to forward a file query to friends that are more trustworthy and more likely to resolve the queries or forward the query to file holders. We also propose follower-and cluster-based file replication algorithms to enhance file search efficiency. The results of trace-driven experiments on the real-world PlanetLab testbed demonstrate the higher efficiency, trustworthiness, and dynamism-resilience of SOCNET compared with other systems. Experimental results also confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategies to improve SOCNET's performance.									4	3	0	0	0	7			0018-9340	1557-9956		WOS:000346572100007

Parameters that were investigated for identifying the key driving forces for atomic and ionic excitation conditions were discharge current, interelectrode gap, and He sheath and counter gas flows. The addition of the He counter gas flow allowed assessment of the additional parameter relevant when aerosol samples are introduced following laser ablation sampling of solid matrices. The introduction of the analytes (500 mu g g(-1) copper and zinc in 2% HNO3) in liquid form through the solution capillary permitted the investigation of source parameter effects, without introducing additional influences from solid sampling such as heterogeneous particle populations. Individual driving forces for excitation/ionization conditions and inter-parametric dependencies were assessed by changing the operating conditions according to a design of experiment (DOE) plan and monitoring Zn and Cu atomic and ionic emission lines (Zn I 213.9 nm, Cu I 324.7 nm, Zn I 481.1 nm, and Zn II 202.5 nm). Pareto plots of standardized effects were used for evaluating levels of significance as well as magnitudes of both individual and inter-active parametric effects on emission responses, background emissions and signal-to-background ratios as well as the LS-APGD's tolerance against changes in excitation conditions (i.e. robustness). The results indicate that parameter settings leading to high plasma power density are the key driving forces for enhanced analyte emission, with the interelectrode distances showing the most pronounced influences for the investigated parameter space.									4	0	0	2	0	4			0267-9477	1364-5544		WOS:000346251800024

Designing a Patient-Centered User Interface for Access Decisions about EHR Data: Implications from Patient Interviews								JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE				30				S7	S16		10.1007/s11606-014-3049-9		1	JAN 2015	2015	BACKGROUND: Electronic health records change the landscape of patient data sharing and privacy by increasing the amount of information collected and stored and the number of potential recipients. Patients desire granular control over who receives what information in their electronic health record (EHR), but there are no current patient interfaces that allow them to record their preferences for EHR access.OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to derive the user needs of patients regarding the design of a user interface that records patients' individual choices about who can access data in their EHRs.DESIGN: We used semi-structured interviews.SETTING: The study was conducted in Central Indiana.PARTICIPANTS: Thirty patients with data stored in an EHR, the majority of whom (70 %) had highly sensitive health EHR data, were included in the study.APPROACH: We conducted a thematic and quantitative analysis of transcribed interview data.KEY RESULTS: Patients rarely knew what data were in their EHRs, but would have liked to know. They also wanted to be able to control who could access what information in their EHR and wanted to be notified when their data we re accessed.CONCLUSIONS: We derived six implications for the design of a patient-centered tool to allow individual choice in the disclosure of EHR: easy patient access to their EHRs; an overview of current EHR sharing permissions; granular, hierarchical control over EHR access; EHR access controls based on dates; contextual privacy controls; and notification when their EHRs are accessed.									3	0	0	1	0	3			0884-8734	1525-1497		WOS:000346249100003	25480719

Point and Counterpoint: Patient Control of Access to Data in Their Electronic Health Records								JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE				30				S38	S41		10.1007/s11606-014-3061-0		1	JAN 2015	2015	Information collection, storage, and management is central to the practice of health care. For centuries, patients' and providers' expectations kept medical records confidential between providers and patients. With the advent of electronic health records, patient health information has become more widely available to providers and health care managers and has broadened its potential use beyond individual patient care. Adhering to the principles of Fair Information Practice, including giving patients control over the availability and use of their individual health records, would improve care by fostering the sharing of sensitive information between patients and providers. However, adherence to such principles could put patients at risk for unsafe care as a result of both missed opportunities for providing needed care as well as provision of contraindicated care, as it would prevent health care providers from having full access to health information. Patients' expectations for the highest possible quality and safety of care, therefore, may be at odds with their desire to limit provider access to their health records. Conversely, provider expectations that patients would willingly seek care for embarrassing conditions and disclose sensitive information may be at odds with patients' information privacy rights. An open dialogue between patients and providers will be necessary to balance respect for patient rights with provider need for patient information.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0884-8734	1525-1497		WOS:000346249100007	25480723

Patient Preferences in Controlling Access to Their Electronic Health Records: a Prospective Cohort Study in Primary Care								JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE				30				S25	S30		10.1007/s11606-014-3054-z		1	JAN 2015	2015	INTRODUCTION: Previous studies have measured individuals' willingness to share personal information stored in electronic health records (EHRs) with health care providers, but none has measured preferences among patients when they are allowed to determine the parameters of provider access.METHODS: Patients were given the ability to control access by doctors, nurses, and other staff in a primary care clinic to personal information stored in an EHR. Patients could restrict access to all personal data or to specific types of sensitive information, and could restrict access for a specific time period. Patients also completed a survey regarding their understanding of and opinions regarding the process.RESULTS: Of 139 eligible patients who were approached, 105 (75.5 %) were enrolled, and preferences were collected from all 105 (100 %). Sixty patients (57 %) did not restrict access for any providers. Of the 45 patients (43 %) who chose to limit the access of at least one provider, 36 restricted access only to all personal information in the EHR, while nine restricted access of some providers to a subset of the their personal information. Thirty-four (32.3 %) patients blocked access to all personal information by all doctors, nurses, and/or other staff, 26 (24.8 %) blocked access by all doctors and/or nurses, and five (4.8 %) denied access to all doctors, nurses, and staff.CONCLUSIONS: A significant minority of patients chose to restrict access by their primary care providers to personal information contained in an EHR, and few chose to restrict access to specific types of information. More research is needed to identify patient goals and understanding of the implications when facing decisions of this sort, and to identify the impact of patient education regarding information contained in EHRs and their use in the clinical care setting.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0884-8734	1525-1497		WOS:000346249100005	25480721

Patients could allow or restrict providers' access to all data (diagnoses, medications, test results, reports, etc.) or only highly sensitive data (sexually transmitted infections, HIV/AIDS, drugs/alcohol, mental or reproductive health). Except for information in free-text reports, we redacted EHR data shown to providers according to patients' preferences. Providers could "break the glass" to display redacted information. We prospectively studied this system in one primary care clinic, noting redactions and when users "broke the glass," and surveyed providers about their experiences and opinions.RESULTS: Eight of nine eligible clinic physicians and all 23 clinic staff participated. All 105 patients who enrolled completed the preference program. Providers did not know which of their patients were enrolled, nor their preferences for accessing their EHRs. During the 6-month prospective study, 92 study patients (88 %) returned 261 times, during which providers viewed their EHRs 126 times (48 %). Providers " broke the glass" 102 times, 92 times for patients not in the study and ten times for six returning study patients, all of whom had restricted EHR access. Providers " broke the glass" for six (14 %) of 43 returning study patients with redacted data vs. zero among 49 study patients without redactions (p=0.01). Although 54 % of providers agreed that patients should have control over who sees their EHR information, 58 % believed restricting EHR access could harm provider-patient relationships and 71 % felt quality of care would suffer.CONCLUSIONS: Patients frequently preferred restricting provider access to their EHRs. Providers infrequently overrode patients' preferences to view hidden data. Providers believed that restricting EHR access would adversely impact patient care. Applying Fair Information Practice principles to EHRs will require balancing patient preferences, providers' needs, and health care quality.									6	0	0	2	0	6			0884-8734	1525-1497		WOS:000346249100006	25480720

For a slope with fuzzy sets as inputs, the stability (factor of safety) of the slope is also a fuzzy set. The failure probability of the slope can readily be determined based on the obtained fuzzy factor of safety; further, the design robustness in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can also be evaluated. The purpose of the RGD is to derive a design that is robust against the uncertainty in the input parameters, with an explicit consideration on safety and cost. Therefore, a multiobjective optimization is performed and a three dimensional or two-dimensional Pareto front showing a trade-off between objectives can be obtained, which allows for an informed design decision. The effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy set-based RGD approach is demonstrated through an illustrative example.

However, the thermodynamic properties and reversibility of NP-protein interactions have rarely been examined. Using an automated, high-throughput and temperature-controlled dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique we observed a distinct hysteresis in the hydrodynamic radius of branched polyethyleneimine (BPEI) coated-silver nanoparticles (bAgNPs) exposed to like-charged lysozyme during the processes of heating and cooling, in contrast to the irreversible interactions between bAgNPs and oppositely charged alpha lactalbumin (ALact). Our discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) simulations offered a new molecular insight into the differential structure, dynamics and thermodynamics of bAgNPs binding with the two protein homologs and further revealed the different roles of the capping agents of citrate and BPEI in NP-protein interactions. This study facilitates our understanding of the transformation of nanomaterials in living systems, whose implications range from the field study of nanotoxicology to nanomaterials synthesis, nanobiotechnology and nanomedicine.									6	1	0	4	0	7			1463-9076	1463-9084		WOS:000346473600025	25461673

Social Media Sites as a Means of Coping with a Threatened Social Identity								LEISURE SCIENCES				37	1			20	38		10.1080/01490400.2014.935835			JAN 1 2015	2015	Since their inception in the early- to mid-2000s, social media sites (SMS) have burgeoned into a popular leisure pursuit with millions of users worldwide. Defined as Internet-based software programs that facilitate communication among individuals, members use them to exchange information, develop friendships, and find social support. Despite their rapid growth as a leisure time activity, there is a dearth of research exploring use of SMS. Using social identity theory as a framework, this study uses quantitative and qualitative data to explore how people who identified as "Penn Staters" used SMS to connect with others and exchange information during and in the wake of the breaking news of the Sandusky Scandal (SS). As predicted, highly identified Penn Staters used SMS to cope with news of the SS. However, interesting variations in usage based on demographic information are presented and discussed, providing greater insight into this increasingly popular leisure trend.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0149-0400	1521-0588		WOS:000346576800002

The network representation can then reveal the evolution, structure and dynamics of those systems. Frequently, obtaining the required scientific data about the networks is expensive or infeasible. In other words, the amount of available empirical data is insufficient for simulation, validation, verification, and other scientific tasks. In these situations, empirical data should be augmented by synthetic data generated from models in such a way that properties of the system are preserved in the synthetic data, even when those properties are unique to the system or not fully known, but existing methods only reproduce a limited set of specified network properties. Here we introduce a novel strategy for synthesizing artificial networks that can realistically model a variety of network properties and that is termed multiscale network generation, or as a specific algorithm, MUSKETEER. This strategy first creates a hierarchy of aggregated representations of the original network, and then reformulates the network generation problem at all levels of this hierarchy in order to take into account properties at multiple scales of the system. The network is then edited at any or all scales, depending on the desired variability in the ensemble of synthetic networks. We find that for many complex networks taken from real-world systems, the strategy is able to preserve important properties with little statistical bias while achieving high degree of variability and arbitrary difference from the original.					18th International Conference on Information Fusion (Fusion)18th International Conference on Information Fusion (Fusion)	JUL 06-09, 2015JUL 06-09, 2015		Washington, DCWashington, DC	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-9824-4386-6	WOS:000389523300022

This can create serious bias in the predictive modeling. Typical standard data mining methods often produce poor performance measures. In this paper, we propose a new method to simultaneously classify large datasets and reduce the effects of missing values. The proposed method is based on a multilevel framework of the cost-sensitive SVM and the expected maximization imputation method for missing values, which relies on iterated regression analyses. We compare classification results of multilevel SVM-based algorithms on public benchmark datasets with imbalanced classes and missing values as well as real data in health applications, and show that our multilevel SVM-based method produces fast, and more accurate and robust classification results.					18th International Conference on Information Fusion (Fusion)18th International Conference on Information Fusion (Fusion)	JUL 06-09, 2015JUL 06-09, 2015		Washington, DCWashington, DC	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-9824-4386-6	WOS:000389523300102

IEEE					A Mobile Acoustic Sensor Fusion Network Using Biologically Inspired Sensors and Synchronization								2015 18TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION FUSION (FUSION)								1717	1723					2015	2015	Hostile fire detection is a critical component of situational awareness in the asymmetric battlefields of ongoing and future conflicts. The ability to detect and localize sources of hostile fire in difficult environments can dramatically increase the survivability of dismounted warfighters. Existing individual acoustic hostile fire sensors provide useful information but are prone to heading errors, variable bearing and range accuracy, as well as reliability issues due to false alarms, limiting the actionability of the information.The warfighter can have significantly improved hostile fire sensor performance through affirmation fusion. By leveraging existing sensors as a sensor network, the improvements come without additional weight, equipment, or power draw on the already overburdened soldier. Key to this objective is the ability to synchronize sensors over the network accurately, without using large amounts of power or network bandwidth, even when GPS-denied. Bio-inspired synchronization enables the proposed network infrastructure and makes possible sensor fusion algorithms on mobile platforms.					18th International Conference on Information Fusion (Fusion)18th International Conference on Information Fusion (Fusion)	JUL 06-09, 2015JUL 06-09, 2015		Washington, DCWashington, DC	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-9824-4386-6	WOS:000389523300226

It is expected that these developments will facilitate the eventual customer acceptance of fully autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we present a configuration of a nonlinear model predictive control scheme for predictive driver assistance. The human driver's steering and acceleration inputs to the vehicle are first interpreted into the driver-desired vehicle responses. These are then configured to be tracked by a coordination of the predictive and the lower level control systems as long as safe motion is predicted for these driver inputs. As soon as a violation of motion constraints is predicted from the driver inputs, the control scheme augments the driver inputs with active steering, brake and/or engine interventions so that the constraints of the vehicle dynamics, road boundaries and dynamic objects are respected. The performance of this proposed scheme is illustrated and discussed considering closed-loop-simulations of some typical driving events in public traffic.

Most current techniques used to form a defined neuronal network are based on microcontact-printing, but the intercellular connections in the patterned low-density network are formed randomly, systematic study of a specific network is not possible. For such study, a practical tool for creating defined neuronal networks in which each intercellular connection can be formed according to a predetermined pattern is critical. In addition, because glia-particularly astrocytes-play an important role in neuronal network processing, a precise platform to study glia-neuron interaction at the single-cell level is necessary. In this chapter we describe a biochip-microfabrication technique and a unique laser cell-micropatterning system for creation of a compartmentalized, axon-isolating, polarized neuron-growth platform at the single-cell level.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0893-2336		978-1-4939-2510-0; 978-1-4939-2509-4	WOS:000372458800007

Each performance expectation is defined in terms of an inter-story drift limit with a predefined non-exceedance probability at a given hazard level. U-shape flexural plates were used to connect the vertical joint between the CLT panels to obtain a ductile behavior and adequate energy dissipation during seismic motion. A design method for ensuring self-centering mechanism is also presented.

However, no driver-centric interfaces have been created to provide vehicle documentation assistance effectively. Drivers are expected to interrupt the driving experience in order to find vehicle information in a paper manual. This paper compares the effects on driving performance and cognitive load when consulting a manual in a simulated driving environment through various conditions. These conditions consist of interacting with a voice activated vehicle manual called the Voice User Help, an on-board multimedia manual, a passenger, and a call center. Results suggest that any kind of interaction to access information while driving has an impact on the driver's attention based on a decrease in driving performance and increase of cognitive load. However, amongst all modalities, voice interfaces seem to be the better option for consulting information while driving. Also, and under some circumstances, interaction with a conversational manual system appears to be safer than human-to-human communication. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Responses to untreated and treated OPW were compared among seven plant species, including three monocotyledons: corn (Zea mays), millet (Panicum miliaceum), and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor); and four dicotyledons: lettuce (Lactuca sativa), okra (Abelmoschus esculents), watermelon (Citrullus lanatus), and soybean (Glycine max). Phytotoxicity was greater in untreated OPW than in treated OPW. Exposures to untreated and treated OPW enhanced growth in some plant species (sorghum, millet, okra, and corn) relative to a negative control and reduced growth in other plant species (lettuce, soybean, and watermelon). Early seedling growth parameters indicated that dicotyledons were more sensitive to test waters compared to monocotyledons, suggesting that morphological differences between plant species affected phytotoxicity. Results indicated the following sensitivity scale for plant species: lettuce > soybean > watermelon > corn> okra approximate to millet >sorghum. Phytotoxicity of the treated OPW to lettuce and soybean, although concentrations of COCs were less than irrigation guideline concentrations, suggests that chemical characterization and comparison to guideline concentrations alone may not be sufficient to evaluate water for use in growing crops.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1522-6514	1549-7879		WOS:000345453400004	25409245

Bone tissue engineering and regenerative medicine: Targeting pathological fractures								JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A				103	1			420	429		10.1002/jbm.a.35139			JAN 2015	2015	Patients with bone diseases have the highest risk of sustaining fractures and of suffering from nonunion bone healing due to tissue degeneration. Current fracture management strategies are limited in design and functionality and do not effectively promote bone healing within a diseased bone environment. Fracture management approaches include pharmaceutical therapy, surgical intervention, and tissue regeneration for fracture prevention, fracture stabilization, and fracture site regeneration, respectively. However, these strategies fail to accommodate the pathological nature of fragility fractures, leading to unwanted side effects, implant failures, and nonunions. To target fragility fractures, fracture management strategies should include bioactive bone substitutes designed for the pathological environment. However, the clinical outcome of these materials must be predictable within various disease environments. Initial development of a targeted treatment strategy should focus on simulating the physiological in vitro bone environment to predict clinical effectiveness of the engineered bone. An in vitro test system can facilitate reduction of implant failures and non-unions in fragility fractures. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Effective transport properties of 3D multi-component microstructures with interface resistance								COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE				96				277	283		10.1016/j.commatsci.2014.09.027			JAN 2015	2015	A three-dimensional image analysis tool has been developed to compute the effective conductivity of a particulate composite made of pores (material 0) and two materials (1) and (2). Three types of resistances are considered: the two resistances between materials (1)-(1) and (2)-(2) and the charge transfer resistance at the interface between materials (1) and (2). The numerical tool uses voxelised 3D numerical microstructures generated by discrete element simulations to mimic the particulate nature of the tested material. The method is validated by comparing its results to a resistance network model that incorporates interface resistance. The validation is conducted for both homogeneous and composite materials. Our tool has the advantage, compared with a resistance-network model, of allowing 3D tomography images to be treated. The method is applied to a microstructure typical of a composite Solid Oxide Fuel Cell cathode, however it is general enough to be a versatile tool for computing effective transport properties of any composite material where interface properties must be taken into account.

The phase and stoichiometries of the resulting materials were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction and energy dispersive spectroscopy, while their high-temperature transport properties were investigated from 300 to 800 K. The Seebeck coefficients and electrical resistivities increased linearly with increasing temperature for the double-filled specimens. The Seebeck coefficients and electrical resistivities did not change very much for the As-substituted specimens. The thermal conductivity for all specimens decreased with increasing temperature up to 700 K, corresponding to the plateau in the Seebeck coefficient, and then increased again due to bipolar diffusion. We find that double filling is a more feasible approach to thermoelectric property optimization than single filling with As substitution.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000345077000005

Repetitive DNA arrays, paralogous sequences, polyploidy, and heterozygosity are main factors that plague de novo genome sequencing projects that typically result in highly fragmented assemblies and are difficult to extract biological meaning. Targeted, sub-genomic sequencing offers complexity reduction by removing distal segments of the genome and a systematic mechanism for exploring prioritized genomic content through BAC sequencing. If one isolates and sequences the genome fraction that encodes the relevant biological information, then it is possible to reduce overall sequencing costs and efforts that target a genomic segment. This chapter describes the sub-genome assembly protocol for an organism based upon a BAC tiling path derived from a genome-scale physical map or from fine mapping using BACs to target sub-genomic regions. Methods that are described include BAC isolation and mapping, DNA sequencing, and sequence assembly.									2	1	0	2	0	2			1064-3745		978-1-4939-1652-8; 978-1-4939-1651-1	WOS:000343243500004	25239741

Microbiological contamination of shell eggs produced in conventional and free-range housing systems								FOOD CONTROL				47				161	165		10.1016/j.foodcont.2014.06.038			JAN 2015	2015	The present study was conducted to determine microbiological contamination of free-range and conventional chicken eggs produced under controlled conditions. Eighty-four certified Salmonella-free Bovan Brown chicks (age 2 days) were grown in 6 separate floor pens until age 16 weeks, and then moved into 3 conventional battery cages (BC) or 3 free-range (FR) housing systems. Total aerobic microorganisms and Enterobacteriaceae on egg shell surfaces were enumerated weekly when the hens were 20-27 weeks of age (N = 535 and N = 541 for BC and FR, respectively). Prevalence of Salmonella and Campylobacter were determined on crushed egg shells (N = 212 and N = 176, respectively) and in feces (N = 36 and N = 30, respectively) collected from hens at 24 and 28 weeks of age. Counts of total aerobic microorganisms recovered from BC and FR eggs ranged from 5.0 to 6.0 logio CFU/mL. Numbers of Enterobacteriaceae averaged 1.0 log CFU/mL higher (90% greater) on FR eggs than on eggs from BC hens. Salmonella was not detected on any of the eggs collected from BC hens (0/212), but prevalence on eggs collected from FR hens was 2.36% positive (5/212). Prevalence of Campylobacter recovered from eggs collected from FR (26.1% positive or 46 out of 176 positive) was significantly higher (P <= 0.0001) than the prevalence of Campylobacter recovered from eggs from BC hens (7.4% positive or 13 out of 176 positive). These data demonstrate that FR eggs, where hens have more contact with eggs after oviposition, have greater microbiological contamination on the egg shell surface than eggs produced in the BC cage systems.

Unless this domain is sufficiently explored with validation experiments, satisfactory model performance at these discrete, tested settings would be insufficient to ensure satisfactory model performance throughout the entire operational domain. The goal of coverage metrics is then to reveal how well a set of validation experiments represents an operational domain. The authors identify the criteria of an exemplary coverage metric, evaluate the ability of existing coverage metrics to fulfill these criteria, and propose a new, improved coverage metric. The proposed metric favors interpolation over extrapolation through a penalty function, causing the metric to prefer a design of validation experiments near the boundaries of the domain, while simultaneously exploring inside the domain. Furthermore, the proposed metric allows the coverage to account for the relative influence of each dimension of the domain on the model output. Application of the proposed coverage metric on a practical, non-trivial two-dimensional problem is demonstrated on the Viscoplastic Self-Consistent material plasticity code for 5182 aluminum alloy. Furthermore, the proposed metric is compared to existing coverage metrics considering a high dimensional problem with application to the Rosenbrock function. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper initially studies a modified topology for flying-capacitor multicell converters (FCMCs) as a modular submultilevel module. The main advantage of the modified FCMC, in comparison with the conventional one, is that the number and voltage rating of the required dc voltage sources are halved. Afterward, the MMC that comprises the series connection of themodified FCMCs used as submultilevelmodules is proposed. Simulation results and experimental measurements taken from the four-cell-five-level laboratory prototype system of the modified FCMC as a modular submultilevel module are presented in order to validate its performance and advantages. Moreover, simulation results and experimental measurements of three cascaded two-cell-three-level modules (ultimately seven-level proposed MMC) and four cascaded two-cell-three-level modules (ultimately nine-level proposed MMC) are presented in order to validate its viability, merits and the proposed control strategy.									37	1	0	0	0	38			0885-8993	1941-0107		WOS:000341624200012

In addition to explaining the anomalous magnetic field response of all the DIII class topological superconducting systems proposed in the literature, we provide a realistic route to engineer a "true" TR-invariant topological superconductor, i.e., one whose pair of Majorana bound states at each end is split by an applied Zeeman field in arbitrary direction. We also prove that quite generally the splitting of the Majorana bound states in a time-reversal-invariant topological superconductor by time-reversal breaking fields is highly anisotropic in spin space.									13	0	0	2	0	13			1098-0121	1550-235X		WOS:000349891600004

Here, we present a scalable roll-to-roll (R2R) spray coating process for synthesizing randomly oriented multi-walled carbon nanotubes electrodes on Al foils. The coin and jellyroll type supercapacitors comprised such electrodes yield high power densities (similar to 700 mW/cm(3)) and energy densities (1 mW h/cm(3)) on par with Li-ion thin film batteries. These devices exhibit excellent cycle stability with no loss in performance over more than a thousand cycles. Our cost analysis shows that the R2R spray coating process can produce supercapacitors with 10 times the energy density of conventional activated carbon devices at similar to 17% lower cost.

It causes significant arterial stiffness, and as yet, no clinical therapy exists to prevent or reverse it. We developed albumin nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with disodium ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) that were designed to target calcified elastic lamina when administrated by intravenous injection.Methods and results: We optimized NP size, charge, and EDTA-loading efficiency (150-200 nm, zeta potential of -22.89 - -31.72 mV, loading efficiency for EDTA similar to 20%) for in vivo targeting in rats. These NPs released EDTA slowly for up to 5 days. In both ex-vivo study and in vivo study with injury-induced local abdominal aortic calcification, we showed that elastin antibody-coated and EDTA-loaded albumin NPs targeted the damaged elastic lamina while sparing healthy artery. Intravenous NP injections reversed elastin-specific MAC in rats after four injections over a 2-week period. EDTA-loaded albumin NPs did not cause the side effects observed in EDTA injection alone, such as decrease in serum calcium (Ca), increase in urine Ca, or toxicity to kidney. There was no bone loss in any treated groups.Conclusion: We demonstrate that elastin antibody-coated and EDTA-loaded albumin NPs might be a promising nanoparticle therapy to reverse elastin-specific MAC and circumvent side effects associated with systemic EDTA chelation therapy.

We study a minisuperspace model together with a homogeneous scalar field, for which we can solve the Hamiltonian constraint exactly and arrive at an explicit expression for the physical (non-vanishing) Hamiltonian. The scale factor and associated momentum cease to be dynamical variables, leaving the scalar field as the only physical degree of freedom. We investigate the resulting classical theory, showing how the dynamics of the scale factor can be recovered via an appropriate interpretation of the Hamiltonian as a volume. We then quantize the system in the Schrodinger picture. In the quantum theory we recover the dynamics of the scale factor by interpreting the spectrum and expectation value of the Hamiltonian as being associated with volume rather than energy. If trajectories in the sense of de Broglie-Bohm are introduced in the quantum theory, these are found to match those of the classical theory. We suggest that these trajectories may provide the basis for a perturbation theory in which both background and perturbations are quantized.									4	1	0	0	0	4			0264-9381	1361-6382		WOS:000345903100010

In this paper we attempt to remedy this situation by considering the gravitational influence exerted by a crystalline nanosphere of mesoscopic size on itself, in the semi-classical, mean field, regime. We study in depth the self-localization process induced by the corresponding nonlinear potential of (gravitational) self-interaction. In particular, we characterize the stability of the associated self-collapsed ground state and estimate the magnitude of the corrections that are due to the internal structure of the object (this includes size-effects and corrections due to the discrete, atomic, structure of the sphere). Finally, we derive an approximated, Gaussian, dynamics which mimics several essential features of the self-gravitating dynamics and, based on numerical results derived from this model, we propose a concrete experimental setting which we believe might, in the foreseeable future, reveal the existence of gravitational self-interaction effects.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0264-9381	1361-6382		WOS:000345903100012

However, connection of the genomic information to cellular functions and biological behaviours relies on the development of effective approaches at higher systems level. In particular, advances in RNA-Seq technology has helped the studies of transcriptome, RNA expressed from the genome, while systems biology on the other hand provides more comprehensive pictures, from which genes and proteins actively interact to lead to cellular behaviours and physiological phenotypes. As biological interactions mediate many biological processes that are essential for cellular function or disease development, it is important to systematically identify genomic information including genetic mutations from GWAS (genome-wide association study), differentially expressed genes, bidirectional promoters, intrinsic disordered proteins (IDP) and protein interactions to gain deep insights into the underlying mechanisms of gene regulations and networks. Furthermore, bidirectional promoters can co-regulate many biological pathways, where the roles of bidirectional promoters can be studied systematically for identifying co-regulating genes at interactive network level. Combining information from different but related studies can ultimately help revealing the landscape of molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases such as cancer.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1471-2105			WOS:000353973500001	25559210

KIRC has been shown resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Like many types of cancers, there is no curative treatment for metastatic KIRC. Using advanced sequencing technologies, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project of NIH/NCI-NHGRI has produced large-scale sequencing data, which provide unprecedented opportunities to reveal new molecular mechanisms of cancer. We combined differentially expressed genes, pathways and network analyses to gain new insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms of the disease development.Results: Followed by the experimental design for obtaining significant genes and pathways, comprehensive analysis of 537 KIRC patients' sequencing data provided by TCGA was performed. Differentially expressed genes were obtained from the RNA-Seq data. Pathway and network analyses were performed. We identified 186 differentially expressed genes with significant p-value and large fold changes (P < 0.01, |log(FC)| > 5). The study not only confirmed a number of identified differentially expressed genes in literature reports, but also provided new findings. We performed hierarchical clustering analysis utilizing the whole genome-wide gene expressions and differentially expressed genes that were identified in this study. We revealed distinct groups of differentially expressed genes that can aid to the identification of subtypes of the cancer. The hierarchical clustering analysis based on gene expression profile and differentially expressed genes suggested four subtypes of the cancer. We found enriched distinct Gene Ontology (GO) terms associated with these groups of genes. Based on these findings, we built a support vector machine based supervised-learning classifier to predict unknown samples, and the classifier achieved high accuracy and robust classification results. In addition, we identified a number of pathways (P < 0.04) that were significantly influenced by the disease. We found that some of the identified pathways have been implicated in cancers from literatures, while others have not been reported in the cancer before. The network analysis leads to the identification of significantly disrupted pathways and associated genes involved in the disease development. Furthermore, this study can provide a viable alternative in identifying effective drug targets.Conclusions: Our study identified a set of differentially expressed genes and pathways in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, and represents a comprehensive computational approach to analysis large-scale next-generation sequencing data. The pathway and network analyses suggested that information from distinctly expressed genes can be utilized in the identification of aberrant upstream regulators. Identification of distinctly expressed genes and altered pathways are important in effective biomarker identification for early cancer diagnosis and treatment planning. Combining differentially expressed genes with pathway and network analyses using intelligent computational approaches provide an unprecedented opportunity to identify upstream disease causal genes and effective drug targets.									10	0	0	6	0	10			1471-2105			WOS:000353973500003	25559354

However, it remains a research challenge for the possibility of clustering amino acid residues based on an underlying interaction, such as co-evolution, to understand how mutations in these related sites can lead to different disease phenotypes.Results: This paper presents an integrative approach to identify groups of co-evolving residues, known as protein sectors. By studying a protein family using multiple sequence alignments and statistical coupling analysis, we attempted to determine if it is possible that these groups of residues could be related to disease phenotypes. After the protein sectors were identified, disease-associated residues within these groups of amino acids were mapped to a structure representing the protein family. In this study, we used the proposed pipeline to analyze two test cases of spermine synthase and Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor.Conclusions: The results suggest that there is a possible link between certain groups of co-evolving residues and different disease phenotypes. The pipeline described in this work could also be used to study other protein families associated with human diseases.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1471-2164			WOS:000353978200005	25559331

The remarkable solution stability of its structure and enzymatic activity has led to its investigation to develop a new class of drugs for cancer chemotherapeutics. However, the successful clinical application of RNase A has been reported to be limited by insufficient stability and loss of enzymatic activity when it was coupled with a biomaterial carrier for drug delivery. The objective of this study was to characterize the structural stability and enzymatic activity of RNase A when it was adsorbed on different surface chemistries (represented by fused silica glass, high-density polyethylene, and poly(methyl-methacrylate)). Changes in protein structure were measured by circular dichroism, amino acid labeling with mass spectrometry, and in vitro assays of its enzymatic activity. Our results indicated that the process of adsorption caused RNase A to undergo a substantial degree of unfolding with significant differences in its adsorbed structure on each material surface. Adsorption caused RNase A to lose about 60% of its native-state enzymatic activity independent of the material on which it was adsorbed. These results indicate that the native-state structure of RNase A is greatly altered when it is adsorbed on a wide range of surface chemistries, especially at the catalytic site. Therefore, drug delivery systems must focus on retaining the native structure of RNase A in order to maintain a high level of enzymatic activity for applications such as antitumor chemotherapy.									5	0	0	2	0	5			0743-7463			WOS:000346685100018	25420087

O'Bryan, Christopher/0000-0002-6472-6957			Anuran assemblages associated with roadside ditches in a managed pine landscape								FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT				334				217	231		10.1016/j.foreco.2014.08.035			DEC 15 2014	2014	Managed forests support a diverse assemblage of herpetofauna. However, less is known about how aquatic features embedded in intensively managed landscapes, particularly modified aquatic habitat types, influence biodiversity. Further, whether additional anthropogenic disturbances to modified aquatic habitats affect occupancy of amphibians has not been studied, but has important ramifications for ongoing policy debates regarding water quality regulations in the United States. We examined species diversity and occupancy of anuran assemblages in an intensively managed forest landscape with a history of ditching, draining, and periodic maintenance of ditches. During 2012-2013, we conducted repeated aural surveys for calling male frogs and toads across 16 roadside ditch segments that were maintained from 3 to 17 years earlier. Across 12 survey events, we detected 15 species of frogs and toads 555 times. We used a community occupancy model to estimate occupancy for multiple anurans and to examine associations between species occupancy for roadside ditches and the time since drainage ditch maintenance, amount of nearby mature forest cover, and metrics describing adjacent depressional wetlands. We predicted a quadratic relationship between both species richness and probability of occupancy for individual species with time since ditch maintenance because we hypothesized anurans would respond positively to intermediate vegetation structure and canopy cover when selecting calling and oviposition sites. Based on previous studies, we also predicted positive relationships between anuran occupancy and diversity with proportion of the surrounding landscape in mature forest or in depressional wetlands, and negative relationship with increasing distance to nearest wetland. Contrary to our prediction, we did not find evidence of a positive response (95% credible intervals included 0) by the community or individual species to time since ditch maintenance or the forest or wetland covariates, but we did observe a diverse assemblage of frogs and toads associated with roadside ditches in managed pine forest. Estimated richness ranged from 5.5 to 11.5 species/site and probabilities of occurrence ranged from 0.01 to 1.00 by species and site. Detection probabilities by species within a season ranged from 0 to 0.93 and were positively influenced by rainfall for several species and differed across months for many species. Our results indicate that reconfigured aquatic habitat types embedded in managed forests can support local and regional occupancy of anurans, but the current anuran community likely differs from what occurred historically.

J	Nguyen, K. V. T.; Anker, Jeffrey N.								Detecting de-gelation through tissue using magnetically modulated optical nanoprobes (MagMOONs)								SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL				205				313	321		10.1016/j.snb.2014.08.073			DEC 15 2014	2014	Alginate gels are widely used for drug delivery and implanted devices. The rate at which these gels break down is important for controlling drug release. Since the de-gelation may be different in vivo, monitoring this process in situ is essential. However, it is challenging to monitor the gel through tissue due to optical scattering and tissue autofluorescence. Herein we describe a method to detect through tissue the chemically-induced changes in viscosity and de-gelation process of alginate gels using magnetically modulated optical nanoprobes (MagMOONs). The MagMOONs are fluorescent magnetic microspheres coated with a thin layer of opaque metal on one hemisphere. The metal layer prevents excitation and emission light from passing through one side of the MagMOONs, which creates orientation-dependent fluorescence intensity. The magnetic particles also align in an external magnetic field and give blinking signals when they rotate to follow an external modulated magnetic field. The blinking signals from these MagMOONs are distinguished from background autofluorescence and can be tracked on a single particle level in the absence of tissue, or for an ensemble average of particles blinking through tissue. When these MagMOONs are dispersed in calcium alginate gel, they become sensors for detecting gel degradation upon addition of either ammonium ion or alginate lyase. Our results show MagMOONs start blinking approximately 10 min after 2 mg/mL alginate lyase addition and this blinking is clearly detected through up to 4 mm chicken breast. This approach can potentially be employed to detect bacterial biofilm formation on medical implants by sensing specific proteases that either activate a related function or regulate biofilm formation. It can also be applied to other biosensors and drug delivery systems based on enzyme-catalyzed breakdown of gel components. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	McFadden, Katherine W.; Gomez, Andres; Sterling, Eleanor J.; Naro-Maciel, Eugenia								Potential impacts of historical disturbance on green turtle health in the unique & protected marine ecosystem of Palmyra Atoll (Central Pacific)								MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN				89	1-2			160	167		10.1016/j.marpolbul.2014.10.012			DEC 15 2014	2014	Palmyra Atoll, in the Central Pacific, is a unique marine ecosystem because of its remarkably intact food web and limited anthropogenic stressors. However during World War II the atoll was structurally reconfigured into a military installation and questions remain whether this may have impacted the health of the atoll's ecosystems and species. To address the issue we assessed green sea turtle (n = 157) health and exposure to contaminants at this foraging ground from 2008 to 2012. Physical exams were performed and blood was sampled for testosterone analysis, plasma biochemistry analysis, hematology and heavy metal exposure. Hematological and plasma chemistries were consistent with concentrations reported for healthy green turtles. Heavy metal screenings revealed low concentrations of most metals, except for high concentrations of iron and aluminum. Body condition indices showed that <1% of turtles had poor body condition. In this study, we provide the first published blood values for a markedly healthy sea turtle population at a remote Central Pacific Atoll.

X-ray measurements in helium-like atoms increased discrepancy between experiment and theoretical QED								NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS				16						123037	10.1088/1367-2630/16/12/123037			DEC 15 2014	2014	A recent 15 parts per million (ppm) experiment on muonic hydrogen (p(+)mu(-)) found a major discrepancy with quantum electrodynamics (QED) and independent nuclear size determinations. Here we find a significant discrepancy in a different type of exotic atom: a medium-Z nucleus with two electrons. Investigation of the data collected is able to discriminate between available QED formulations and reveals a pattern of discrepancy of almost six standard errors of experimental results from the most recent theoretical predictions, with a functional dependence proportional to Z(n) where n similar or equal to 4. In both the muonic and highly charged systems, the sign of the discrepancy is the same, with the measured transition energy higher than predicted. Some consequences are possible or probable, and some are more speculative. This may give insight into effective nuclear radii, the Rydberg, the fine-structure constant, or unexpectedly large QED terms.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1367-2630			WOS:000346822100007		
J	Liu, Jui Tung; Bain, Lisa J.								Arsenic inhibits hedgehog signaling during P19 cell differentiation								TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY				281	3			243	253		10.1016/j.taap.2014.10.007			DEC 15 2014	2014	Arsenic is a toxicant found in ground water around the world, and human exposure mainly comes from drinking water or from crops grown in areas containing arsenic in soils or water. Epidemiological studies have shown that arsenic exposure during development decreased intellectual function, reduced birth weight and altered locomotor activity, while in vitro studies have shown that arsenite decreased muscle and neuronal cell differentiation. The sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway plays an important role during the differentiation of both neurons and skeletal muscle. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether arsenic can disrupt Shh signaling in P19 mouse embryonic stem cells, leading to changes muscle and neuronal cell differentiation. P19 embryonic stem cells were exposed to 0, 0.25, or 0.5 mu M of sodium arsenite for up to 9 days during cell differentiation. We found that arsenite exposure significantly reduced transcript levels of genes in the Shh pathway in both a time and dose-dependent manner. This included the Shh ligand, which was decreased 2- to 3-fold, the Gli2 transcription factor, which was decreased 2-to 3-fold, and its downstream target gene Ascl1, which was decreased 5-fold. GLI2 protein levels and transcriptional activity were also reduced. However, arsenic did not alter GLI2 primary cilium accumulation or nuclear translocation. Moreover, additional extracellular SHH rescued the inhibitory effects of arsenic on cellular differentiation due to an increase in GLI binding activity. Taken together, we conclude that arsenic exposure affected Shh signaling, ultimately decreasing the expression of the Gli2 transcription factor. These results suggest a mechanism by which arsenic disrupts cell differentiation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.									5	0	0	4	0	5			0041-008X	1096-0333		WOS:000346460700001	25448440

Four heat-treated (HT) carbon modifiers were investigated: PR-19-HT carbon nanofibers, multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNT-HT), helical multiwalled carbon nanotubes (HCNT-HT), and mesophase pitch-based P55 carbon fibers as a control. These were melt-mixed with linear low density polyethylene at 10 vol %, which was above the percolation threshold. The electromagnetic shielding effectiveness (EM SE) of the composites exhibits significant dependence on the modifier morphology. Thus, MWHTs, with the highest aspect ratio, lead to the highest composite electrical and thermal conductivities (34 Sm-1 and 1 Wm(-1) K-1) and EM SE (similar to 24 dB). In contrast, HCNT, due to their coiled shape and low aspect ratio, lead to segregated microstructure and low EM SE (<1 dB). However, these composites display the highest ductility (similar to 250%) and flexibility, probably due to matrix-modifier mechanical bonding provided by the helical morphology.

Electrochemical Behavior of Platinum Nanoparticles on a Carbon Xerogel Support Modified with a [(Trifluoromethyl)-benzenesulfonyl]imide Electrolyte								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B				118	49			14115	14123		10.1021/jp505417e			DEC 11 2014	2014	A monoprotic [(trifluoromethyl)benzenesulfonyl]imide (SI) superacid electrolyte was used to covalently modify a mesoporous carbon xerogel (CX) support via reaction of the corresponding trifluoromethyl aryl sulfonimide diazonium zwitterion with the carbon surface. Electrolyte attachment was demonstrated by elemental analysis, acidbase titration, and thermogravimetric analysis. The ion-exchange capacity of the fluoroalkyl-aryl-sulfonimide-grafted carbon xerogel (SI-CX) was similar to 0.18 mequiv g1, as indicated by acidbase titration. Platinum nanoparticles were deposited onto the SI-grafted carbon xerogel samples by the impregnation and reduction method, and these materials were employed to fabricate polyelectrolyte membrane fuel-cell (PEMFC) electrodes by the decal transfer method. The SI-grafted carbon-xerogel-supported platinum (Pt/SI-CX) was characterized by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy to determine platinum nanoparticle size and distribution, and the findings are compared with CX-supported platinum catalyst without the grafted SI electrolyte (Pt/CX). Platinum nanoparticle sizes are consistently larger on Pt/SI-CX than on Pt/CX. The electrochemically active surface area (ESA) of platinum catalyst on the Pt/SI-CX and Pt/CX samples was measured with ex situ cyclic voltammetry (CV) using both hydrogen adsorption/desorption and carbon monoxide stripping methods and by in situ CV within membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs). The ESA values for Pt/SI-CX are consistently lower than those for Pt/CX. Some possible reasons for the behavior of samples with and without grafted SI layers and implications for the possible use of SI-grafted carbon layers in PEMFC devices are discussed.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1520-6106			WOS:000349059700015	25302866

The sunlight-exposed EO was found to possess an oily off-flavor odor, which was significantly different from its counterparts induced by oxygen and heat. The strong oily note of the sunlight-exposed EO was attributed to the existence of linalool oxides and limonene oxides, as well as the lack of neral and geranial, for which UV sunlight was revealed to be the critical contributor causing the chemical reactions for the aroma changes. The results demonstrated that UV sunlight could significantly affect the aroma of the pummelo EO, providing valuable information that will benefit the production and storage of EO-based aromatic products.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0021-8561	1520-5118		WOS:000346321400005	25438994

Herein, a top-down strategy to chemically tailor the inexpensive coal to fluorescent CDs by a combined method of carbonization and acidic oxidation etching is reported. The size and optical properties of the as-made CDs are tuned by controlling the structures of graphitic crystallites in the starting precursor. The coal-derived CDs exhibit two different distinctive emission modes, where the intensity of the short-wavelength emission is significantly enhanced by partial reduction treatment. The evolution of the electronic structure and the surface states analysis show that two different types of fluorescence centers, nano-sized sp(2) carbon domains and surface defects, are responsible for the observed emission characteristics. The reduced CDs are demonstrated as an effective fluorescent sensing material for label-free and selective detection of Cu(II) ions with a detection limit as low as 2.0 nM, showing a great promise for real-world sensor applications.									36	4	0	2	0	38			1613-6810	1613-6829		WOS:000345973300015	25048718

The remnant is detected with high significance (> 10 sigma) below 50 keV. We detect significant hard X-ray emission in the 60-85 keV band, above the continuum level predicted by a simple synchrotron model. The location of the observed excess is consistent with line emission from radioactive titanium-44, so far reported only for Type II supernova explosions. We discuss the implications of these results in the context of the galactic supernova rate, and nucleosynthesis in Type Ia supernova.									3	0	0	0	0	3			2041-8205	2041-8213		WOS:000345504000006

The material was characterized using transmission electron microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, powdered X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, Zeta potential measurements and UV-Visible spectroscopic techniques. The as-synthesized gold-graphene composite was effectively utilized as catalyst for decolorization of 4 important textile and laser dyes. The integration of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with high surface area graphene has enhanced the catalytic activity of AuNPs. This enhanced activity is attributed to the synergistic interplay of pristine gold's electronic relay and pi-pi stacking of graphene with the dyes. This is evident when the Rhodamine B (RB) reduction rate of the composite is nearly twice faster than that of commercial citrate capped AuNPs of similar size. In case of Methylene blue (MB) the rate of reduction is 17,000 times faster than uncatalyzed reaction. This synthetic method opens door to laser ablation based fabrication of metal catalysts on graphene for improved performance without the aid of linkers and surfactants. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Kinetics of Evaporation and Gel Formation in Thin Films of Ceramic Precursors								LANGMUIR				30	48			14638	14647		10.1021/la5037986			DEC 9 2014	2014	Precursors derived from the hydrolysis of organic or inorganic salts have been widely used to produce ceramic coatings for a broad variety of applications. When applying the liquid precursors to the substrates, it is extremely challenging to control the film uniformity and homogeneity. The rate of solvent evaporation at different locations is different, causing the viscosity variation and flows in the film. There is very limited knowledge about the viscosity change in evaporating ceramic precursors. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the effect of evaporation on viscosity variation in thin films and droplets. We use magnetic rotational spectroscopy to study the time dependence of viscosity in mullite precursors. A correlation between the viscosity change and evaporation kinetics is revealed. This correlation was used to relate the change of viscosity to the concentration of mullite. A master curve relating viscosity to the mullite concentration was constructed and used to propose a possible scenario of the viscosity increase during solvent evaporation.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0743-7463			WOS:000346325700032	25397585

Traditionally, endoderm has been difficult to study because of its small size and relative fragility. However, recent advances in live cell imaging technologies have dramatically expanded our understanding of this tissue, adding a new appreciation for the complex molecular and morphogenetic processes that mediate gut formation. Several spatially and molecularly distinct subpopulations have been shown to exist within the endoderm before the onset of gastrulation. Here, we review findings that have uncovered complex cell movements within the endodermal layer, before and during gastrulation, leading to the conclusion that cells from primitive endoderm contribute descendants directly to gut.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0962-8436	1471-2970		WOS:000344527900013

This study investigates mechanical and water stability of composites produced from introduction of a minor component of a synthetic polyethylene as a binder phase to consolidate MBM. The milled and sieved MBM was compounded with 5-60 wt % linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) and formed into composite sheets by calendering, which is an industrially relevant process. Results indicated that a minimum of 15 wt % LLDPE content was required to form a nominally continuous binder phase that allowed for good processability and environment stability of the composites. As expected, the water vapor permeability (WVP) and water absorption characteristics of the composites were intermediate between those of MBM and LLDPE. Sheets containing 15 wt % LLDPE absorbed up to 35 wt % water. Composites tested after being soaked in water showed an initial decrease in TS of about 30% for the first hour but then remained fairly unchanged in the next 72 hours, confirming their moderate environment stability.

The Bull Sperm MicroRNAome and the Effect of Fescue Toxicosis on Sperm MicroRNA Expression								PLOS ONE				9	12					e113163	10.1371/journal.pone.0113163			DEC 2 2014	2014	Tall fescue [Schedonorus phoenix (Scop.) Holub] accounts for nearly 16 million hectares of pasture in the Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic U.S. due to its heat, drought, and pest resistance, conferred to the plant by its symbiotic relationship with the endophyte Neotyphodium coenophialum. The endophyte produces ergot alkaloids that have negative effects on the growth and reproduction of animals, resulting in the syndrome known as fescue toxicosis. The objectives of our study were to identify microRNA (miRNA) present in bovine sperm and to evaluate the effects of fescue toxicosis on sperm miRNA expression. Angus bulls were assigned to treatments of either toxic or non-toxic fescue seed diets. Semen was collected and subjected to RNA isolation. Three samples from each treatment group were chosen and pooled for deep sequencing. To compare miRNA expression between treatment groups, a microarray was designed and conducted. For each of the top ten expressed miRNA, target prediction analysis was conducted using TargetScan. Gene ontology enrichment was assessed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery. Sequencing results elucidated the presence of 1,582 unique small RNA present in sperm. Of those sequences, 382 were known Bos taurus miRNA, 22 were known but novel to Bos taurus, and 816 were predicted candidate miRNA that did not map to any currently reported miRNA. Of the sequences chosen for microarray, twenty-two showed significant differential expression between treatment groups. Gene pathways of interest included: regulation of transcription, embryonic development (including blastocyst formation), Wnt and Hedgehog signaling, oocyte meiosis, and kinase and phosphatase activity. MicroRNA present in mature sperm appears to not only be left over from spermatogenic processes, but may actually serve important regulatory roles in fertilization and early developmental processes. Further, our results indicate the possibility that environmental changes may impact the expression of specific miRNA.									9	0	0	8	0	9			1932-6203			WOS:000345869700027	25462855

Spheroids are being used in research for basic science, developmental biology, cancer biology, tissue engineering, drug discovery, and toxicity testing. As spheroids become increasingly used in these applications, it is critical to understand and visualize cells and extracellular matrix content over time. Standard histological methods cannot be applied for fixation and processing of spheroids due to their small size and delicate nature. Given this, there is a need to develop a method to prepare and process spheroids for histological sectioning and examination. A technique was developed for preparing spheroids and tissues composed of spheroids for histological examination, using cellular spheroids for tissue engineering applications.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0147-8885	2046-0236		WOS:000346356600008

We characterized the recombinant E. histolytica ACD and found that the enzyme is bidirectional, allowing it to potentially play a role in ATP production or in utilization of acetate. In the acetate-forming direction, acetyl-CoA was the preferred substrate and propionyl-CoA was used with lower efficiency. In the acetyl-CoA-forming direction, acetate was the preferred substrate, with a lower efficiency observed with propionate. The enzyme can utilize both ADP/ATP and GDP/GTP in the respective directions of the reaction. ATP and PPi were found to inhibit the acetate-forming direction of the reaction, with 50% inhibitory concentrations of 0.81 +/- 0.17 mM (mean +/- standard deviation) and 0.75 +/- 0.20 mM, respectively, which are both in the range of their physiological concentrations. ATP and PPi displayed mixed inhibition versus each of the three substrates, acetyl-CoA, ADP, and phosphate. This is the first example of regulation of ACD enzymatic activity, and possible roles for this regulation are discussed.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1535-9778	1535-9786		WOS:000345531700006	25303954

HEALTH ASSESSMENTS OF BROWN PELICAN (PELECANUS OCCIDENTALIS) NESTLINGS FROM COLONIES IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA, USA								JOURNAL OF ZOO AND WILDLIFE MEDICINE				45	4			802	812		10.1638/2013-0157.1			DEC 2014	2014	Health evaluations of brown pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis) nestlings from three colonies along the Atlantic coast of the southeastern United States were performed in 2005, 2007, and 2008. The primary objective of this study was to establish baseline data for hematologic, biochemical, and serologic values from a relatively healthy population of free-living pelicans during early chick development. Relationships among health variables and colony site, ectoparasite infestation, sex, and body condition index were also evaluated. Reference intervals are presented for health variables, including novel analytes for the species, as well as a comparison of these results with previously published values for wild pelicans. No significant relationships were found between health variables and nestling sex or body condition; however, differences between colony sites and the presence of ectoparasites were detected. The inclusion of health assessments as a regular component of management programs for seabirds can provide data to better understand the effect to species of concern when drastic changes occur to the population and its environment.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1042-7260	1937-2825		WOS:000347080900010	25632666	
J	Johri, Rajit; Filipi, Zoran								Neuro-fuzzy model tree approach to virtual sensing of transient diesel soot and NOx emissions								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINE RESEARCH				15	8	SI		918	927		10.1177/1468087413492962			DEC 2014	2014	Diesel engine combustion and emission formation are highly nonlinear and thus create a challenge related to engine diagnostics and engine control with emission feedback. This article describes the development of neuro-fuzzy models for prediction of transient NOX and soot emission from a diesel engine. The modeling techniques are motivated by the idea of divide and conquer the input-output space. The complex problem is divided into multiple simpler subproblems, which are then identified using simpler class of models. This article explores two different choices of local models, specifically polynomial and neural networks. The modeling technique is augmented with input relevance algorithm to select the most relevant input regressors. Two algorithms, namely, orthogonal least square and automatic relevance determination, are introduced. The models are data driven, and an advanced experimental setup incorporating a medium duty diesel engine and fast emission analyzers for soot and NOX is used to generate training data. The choice of local models and input relevance algorithm is validated with instantaneous emission recorded during transient schedules different from those used in development. High prediction accuracy, both qualitatively and quantitatively, is demonstrated with low computational cost.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1468-0874	2041-3149		WOS:000345300200004

This paper describes the implementation process of the RTHS focusing on the controller scheme development. An incremental approach was adopted starting from a controller for the conventional slow pseudodynamic hybrid simulation and evolving to the one applicable for RTHS. Both benchmark- scale and full-scale tests are discussed to provide a roadmap for future RTHS implementation at different laboratories and/or on different structural systems. The developed RTHS controller was applied to study the effect of a rate-dependent energy dissipation device on the seismic performance of a multi-story wood shear wall system. The test specimen, setup, program and results are presented with emphasis given to inter-story drift response. At 100% DBE the RTHS showed that the multi-story shear wall with the damper had 32% less inter-story drift and was noticeably less damaged than its un-damped specimen counterpart.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1738-1584			WOS:000347932500003

The MTM, a temperature enhancement in the upper atmosphere (at similar to 300 km altitude), is a poorly understood phenomenon as observations are sparse. An upward propagating terdiurnal tide and coupling between atmospheric regions may play a large part in the generation of the MTM, yet this phenomenon and its implications are not fully understood. Two nights (6 March 1989 and 12 July 1988) show clear cases of the MTM occurring between 30 and 34 degrees N with amplitudes of similar to 100 K and at similar to 18 degrees N with amplitudes of similar to 40 K. The MTMs occurred later at the higher latitude. Experiments in 2013 also show a clear MTM at 34 degrees and 36 degrees N from 250 to 350 km altitude. The ionospheric measurements presented here demonstrate a new application of a well-established technique to study atmospheric parameters and allow us to study the latitudinal extent of the MTM. The results provide evidence of the phenomenon occurring at latitudes and altitudes not previously sampled by radar techniques, showing that the MTM is not just an equatorial process, but one that can easily reach midlatitudes. Simultaneous measurements with a Fabry-Perot interferometer allow us to compare the neutral temperatures with the ion temperature. Overall, these are key observations that point to large-scale effects that can help constrain model outputs at different heights and latitudes.									4	0	0	0	0	4			2169-9380	2169-9402		WOS:000349161100081		
J	Weimer, Katja; Horing, Bjoern; Muth, Eric R.; Enck, Paul								How to Study Placebo Responses in Motion Sickness with a Rotation Chair Paradigm in Healthy Participants								JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS					94					e52471	10.3791/52471			DEC 2014	2014	Placebo responses occur in every medical intervention when patients or participants expect to receive an effective treatment to relieve symptoms. However, underlying mechanisms of placebo responses are not fully understood. It has repeatedly been shown that placebo responses are associated with changes in neural activity but for many conditions it is unclear whether they also affect the target organ, such as the stomach in motion sickness. Therefore, we present a methodology for the multivariate assessment of placebo responses by subjective, behavioral and objective measures in motion sickness with a rotation chair paradigm. The physiological correlate of motion sickness is a shift in gastric myoelectrical activity towards tachygastria that can be recorded with electrogastrography. The presented study applied the so-called balanced placebo design (BPD) to investigate the effects of ginger compared to placebo and the effects of expectations by verbal information. However, the study revealed no significant main or interactional effects of ginger (as a drug) or information on outcome measures but showed interactions when sex of participants and experimenters are taken into considerations. We discuss limitations of the presented study and report modifications that were used in subsequent studies demonstrating placebo responses when rotation speed was lowered. In general, future placebo studies have to identify the appropriate target organ for the studied placebo responses and to apply the specific methods to assess the physiological correlates.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1940-087X			WOS:000349358000076

SAP-SUCKING INSECT RECORDS (HEMIPTERA: STERNORRHYNCHA AND THYSANOPTERA: THRIPIDAE) FROM INDONESIA								FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST				97	4			1594	1597					DEC 2014	2014	Sap-sucking insects (Hemiptera: Sternorrhyncha and Thysanoptera: Thripidae) collected in Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi were identified. From 28 samples collected on 9 crop and ornamental host-plant species, 21 species of sap-sucking insects were identified, 12 (57%) of which were new island distribution records. This suggests that the Indonesian insect fauna has not been documented for a long time. The new distribution records are: from Java, Lepidosaphes gloverii (Packard) (Diaspididae); from Sumatra, Clavaspidiotus apicalis Takagi (Diaspididae); and from Sulawesi, Coccus hesperidum L. (Coccidae), Saissetia coffeae (Walker) (Coccidae), Aulacaspis yasumatsui Takagi (Diaspididae), Hemiberlesia palmae (Cockerell) (Diaspididae), Lepidosaphes tokionis (Kuwana) (Diaspididae), Microparlatoria fici (Takahashi) (Diaspididae), Pseudaulacaspis cockerelli (Cooley) (Diaspididae), Icerya aegyptiaca (Douglas) (Monophlebidae), I. pulchra (Leonardi) (Monophlebidae) and Selenothrips rubrocinctus (Giard) (Thripidae). Clavaspidiotus apicalis could become a potentially invasive pest of citrus.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0015-4040	1938-5102		WOS:000346693100031

J	Yang, Huaxiao; Borg, Thomas K.; Schmidt, Lucas P.; Gao, Bruce Z.								Laser cell-micropatterned pair of cardiomyocytes: the relationship between basement membrane development and gap junction maturation								BIOFABRICATION				6	4					045003	10.1088/1758-5082/6/4/045003			DEC 2014	2014	The basement membrane (BM), a network of laminin and collagen IV, mechanically supports individual cells and directly mediates cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. For example, the BM network that tightly encloses each cardiomyocyte (CM) mediates the alignment of CMs with collagen I in the ECM. Additionally, the BM-laminin is involved in the formation of gap junctions (GJs), which regulate electrical coupling between two CMs in the myocardium. The role of BM in GJ maturation remains unclear because of the complicated in vivo structures and lack of an ideal in vitro culturing mode. In this study, our laser cell-micropatterning system was used to place two neonatal CMs (NCMs) in contact on an aligned collagen gel (ACG) to study the relationship between GJ maturation and BM development. The results of double immunofluorescence staining and confocal imaging showed that BM-laminin was deposited earlier than the formation of GJs in the intercellular space and that newly expressed connexin 43 clusters were preferentially assembled near the deposited BM structures. Eventually the BM network surrounded the GJs.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1758-5082	1758-5090		WOS:000348353700004	25215627	
J	Bethea, Frank G., Jr.; Park, Dara; Mount, Andrew; Menchyk, Nick; Liu, Haibo								Effects of Acute Moisture Stress on Creeping Bentgrass Cuticle Morphology and Associated Effects on Foliar Nitrogen Uptake								HORTSCIENCE				49	12			1582	1587					DEC 2014	2014	Foliar fertilization is a common practice to deliver nitrogen (N) to turfgrasses. The mechanisms of foliar applied nutrient uptake, particularly the effects of the leaf cuticle layer, have not been clearly characterized in turfgrasses. The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of acute moisture stress on the morphological and compositional components of the cuticle and the resulting effect on foliar-applied N absorption. Creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) was irrigated to return 100% or 50% evapotranspiration rate (ET) for 10 days to examine cuticular modifications resulting from acute moisture stress and foliar N uptake with and without a surfactant. Acute water stress increased the total cuticle wax by 11%, mostly as a result of the compound 1-hexacosanol, and increased crystalloid density creating a rougher leaf surface. The 50% ET treatment significantly reduced recovery of N-15-labeled urea by 14%, which was attributed to the increased total cuticle wax and crystalloid density making the surface less receptive to foliar applications. The surfactant addition to the urea solution increased N-15-labeled urea recovery by 21% and absorption of N-15 in 50% ET plants to levels consistent with the 100% ET plants. These results suggest that acute moisture stress modifies the cuticle wax load and morphology, thereby hindering foliar absorption; however, a surfactant addition can help to mitigate this effect and increase absorption of N.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0018-5345	2327-9834		WOS:000348008400017

Site Specific Nematode Management-Development and Success in Cotton Production in the United States								JOURNAL OF NEMATOLOGY				46	4			309	320					DEC 2014	2014	Variability in edaphic factors such as clay content, organic matter, and nutrient availability within individual fields is a major obstacle confronting cotton producers. Adaptation of geospatial technologies such global positioning systems (GPS), yield monitors, autosteering, and the automated on-and-off technology required for site-specific nematicide application has provided growers with additional tools for managing nematodes. Multiple trials in several states were conducted to evaluate this technology in cotton. In a field infested with Meloidogyne spp., both shallow (0 to 0.3 m) and deep (0 to 0.91 m) apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) readings were highly correlated with sand content. Populations of Meloidogyne spp. were present when shallow and deep EC values were less than 30 and 90 mS/m, respectively. Across three years of trials in production fields in which verification strips (adjacent nematicide treated and untreated rows across all soil zones) were established to evaluate crop response to nematicide application, deep EC values from 27.4-m wide transects of verification strips were more predictive of yield response to application of 1,3-dichloropropene than were shallow EC values in one location and both ECa values equally effective at predicting responses at the second location. In 2006, yields from entire verification strips across three soil zones in four production fields showed that nematicide response was greatest in areas with the lowest EC values indicating highest content of sand. In 2008 in Ashley and Mississippi Counties, AR, nematicide treatment by soil zone resulted in 36% and 42% reductions in the amount of nematicide applied relative to whole-field application. In 2007 in Bamberg County, SC, there was a strong positive correlation between increasing population densities of Meloidogyne incognita and increasing sand content. Trials conducted during 2007 and 2009 in South Carolina against Hoplolaimus columbus showed a stepwise response to increasing rates of aldicarb in zone 1 but not in zones 2 and 3. Site-specific application of nematicides has been shown to be a viable option for producers as a potential management tool against several nematode pathogens of cotton.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0022-300X			WOS:000348649800001	25580023

LOOKING TOWARD THE FUTURE OF IT-BUSINESS STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT THROUGH THE PAST: A META-ANALYSIS								MIS QUARTERLY				38	4			1159	1185					DEC 2014	2014	Research examining the relationship between IT-business strategic alignment (hereafter referred to as alignment) and firm performance (hereafter referred to as performance) has produced apparently conflicting findings (i.e., an alignment paradox). To examine the alignment paradox, we conducted a meta-analysis that probed the interrelationships between alignment, performance, and context constructs. We found the alignment dimensions (intellectual, operational, and cross-domain) demonstrate unique relationships with the different performance types (financial performance, productivity, and customer benefit) and with many of the other constructs in alignment's nomological network. All mean corrected correlations between dimensions of alignment and dependent variables were positive and most of the credibility interval values in these analyses were also positive. Overall, the evidence gathered from the extant literature suggests there is not much of an alignment paradox. This study contributes to the literature by clarifying the relationships between alignment and performance outcomes and offering insight into sources of inconsistencies in alignment research. By doing so, this paper lays a foundation for more consistent treatment of alignment in future IT research.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0276-7783			WOS:000348600300011		
J	Dyckman, Caitlin S.; St John, Courtney; London, James B.								Realizing managed retreat and innovation in state-level coastal management planning								OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT				102				212	223		10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2014.09.010			DEC 2014	2014	U.S. coastal areas are projected to experience varying degrees of climate-change induced sea level rise (SLR), erosion and inundation in the next century. More than half of the country's population lives in a coastal area, putting growth on a collision course with observed and anticipated climate change impacts. This research examines the current status of the state-level coastal management toolbox and their ease of implementation compared to the ideal of managed retreat, and the emergence of innovative tools in response to climate change impacts. The first of a two-phased methodology, the authors conducted document collection to generate a regulatory context for each coastal state, followed by survey administration to record a temporal slice of both the managed retreat efforts and the self-identified and empirically determined coastal management innovations in 29 coastal states. The authors generated a new definition of innovation in the coastal management canon, and conducted follow-up interviews with those empirically innovative states. Despite site-contingent application of the managed retreat ideal tools, soft stabilization remains the most ubiquitous and easiest tool category to implement in urban coastal areas. The managed retreat ideal's fixed setbacks, land acquisition, and hazardous zoning tools are used more frequently than most modification of development tools, particularly in the innovative states. Coastal management tool innovations reflect the managed retreat ideal's holistic ocean/estuarine shoreline management intent. But additional innovation is needed to generate long-term strategies that balance growth pressure with dynamic coastal processes. Program implementation still lags, given the property rights battles that are increasingly relevant in the current political climate. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

An Introduction to the Symposium								INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY				54	6			1051	1057		10.1093/icb/icu105			DEC 2014	2014	Locomotion is fundamental to the survival of many animal species, and terrestrial environments are one of the primary habitats through which a wide range of animals (including humans) must move. Many recent efforts have been made to broaden the approaches and systems used to understand how terrestrial locomotion is executed and modulated. This symposium highlights these efforts and seeks to identify new directions for the study of this diverse behavior. Studies focusing on the structural and functional foundations of terrestrial locomotion, terrestrial locomotor dynamics, and terrestrial locomotor diversity point toward several promising areas for future work. These include: the development, application, and refinement of computational and robotic models; the integration of approaches to clarify which of multiple layers of selection and biological organization influence locomotor performance; increasing the taxonomic, environmental, and behavioral range of study systems to promote new research syntheses and questions; and expansion of studies from laboratory settings to examinations in the field and in the context of ontogenetic and evolutionary time. With new, integrative data from diverse systems in natural settings, new opportunities will emerge for understanding how locomotion contributes to the survival and fitness of terrestrial animals.

Perspectives on the simulation of protein-surface interactions using empirical force field methods								COLLOIDS AND SURFACES B-BIOINTERFACES				124		SI		25	37		10.1016/j.colsurfb.2014.06.050			DEC 1 2014	2014	Protein-surface interactions are of fundamental importance for a broad range of applications in the fields of biomaterials and biotechnology. Present experimental methods are limited in their ability to provide a comprehensive depiction of these interactions at the atomistic level. In contrast, empirical force field based simulation methods inherently provide the ability to predict and visualize protein-surface interactions with full atomistic detail. These methods, however, must be carefully developed, validated, and properly applied before confidence can be placed in results from the simulations. In this perspectives paper, I provide an overview of the critical aspects that I consider being of greatest importance for the development of these methods, with a focus on the research that my combined experimental and molecular simulation groups have conducted over the past decade to address these issues. These critical issues include the tuning of interfacial force field parameters to accurately represent the thermodynamics of interfacial behavior, adequate sampling of these types of complex molecular systems to generate results that can be comparable with experimental data, and the generation of experimental data that can be used for simulation results evaluation and validation.

Although these two important workplace trends are pervasive, their interdependencies have remained largely unexplored. While Information Systems (IS) research has established the pertinence of age to IS phenomena from an empirical perspective, it has tended to model the concept merely as a control variable with limited understanding of its conceptual nature. In fact, even the few IS studies that used the concept of age as a substantive variable have mostly relied on stereotypical accounts alone to justify their age-related hypotheses. Further, most of these studies have examined the role of age in the same phenomenon (i.e., initial adoption of ICTs), implying a marked lack of diversity with respect to the phenomena under investigation. Overall, IS research has yielded only limited insight into the role of age in phenomena involving ICTs. In this essay, we argue for the importance of studying age-related impacts more carefully and across various IS phenomena, and we enable such research by providing a research agenda that IS scholars can use. In doing so, we hope that future research will further both our empirical and conceptual understanding of the managerial challenges arising from the interplay of a graying workforce and rapidly evolving ICTs.

The results indicated that the twinning activity was closely related with two angles: one was the angle between the c-axis and the compression direction and the other was the angle between the a-axis and the titling direction in the basal plane for a given relation between the c-axis and the compression direction. These two parameters can be used to explain which twinning variant will operate under the given strain path. For the grains containing a single {10-12} twinning variant, the {10-12} twinning variant occurred in a wide range of Schmid factor values (0< Schmid factor <0.5) and the Schmid factor rank of 1 or 2 was the most commonly observed. By contrast, for the grains containing two {10-12} twinning variants, the {10-12} twinning activity exhibited a stronger orientation dependence and the combinations of Schmid factor ranks 1-3 and 1-2 were the most commonly observed.

In this report, we investigate a serially-coupled triple resonator system, where a freestanding beam is placed in the vicinity of the middle resonator.

Endurance was assessed with the 6-minute walk and modified 2-min step test.Results: After a Bonferroni Correction, pain, neck ROM, hip passive ROM, upper extremity strength, and the 6-min walk scores all significantly improved after 8 weeks of engaging in yoga. No changes occurred in the wait-list control group.Conclusions: A group therapeutic-yoga intervention may improve multiple aspects of physical functioning after stroke. Such an intervention may be complementary to traditional rehabilitation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0965-2299	1873-6963		WOS:000347128300005	25453519

COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING				78				55	65		10.1016/j.cie.2014.09.030			DEC 2014	2014	In this paper, we investigate a supply network design in supply chain with unreliable supply with application in the pharmaceutical industry. We consider two types of decision making policies: (1) a risk-neutral decision-making policy that is based on a cost-minirnization approach and (2) a risk-averse policy wherein, rather than selecting facilities and identifying the pertinent supplier-consumer assignments that minimize the expected cost, the decision-maker uses a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) approach to measure and quantify risk and to define what comprises a worst-case scenario. The CVaR methodology allows the decision-maker to specify to what extent worst-case scenarios should be avoided and the corresponding costs associated with such a policy. After introducing the underlying optimization models, we present computational analysis and statistical analysis to compare the results of the risk-averse and risk-neutral policies. In addition, we provide several managerial insights. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									3	1	0	0	0	4			0360-8352	1879-0550		WOS:000347266200006

Analysis and Comparison of Plane Wave Shielding Effectiveness Decompositions								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTROMAGNETIC COMPATIBILITY				56	6			1711	1714		10.1109/TEMC.2014.2332133			DEC 2014	2014	Plane wave shielding effectiveness is frequently expressed as the sum of three terms called absorption loss, reflection loss, and a multiple reflections term. This well-known decomposition was introduced by Schelkunoff and provides an intuitive way of relating material properties to the overall shielding effectiveness. This letter derives equations relating the Schelkunoff decomposition terms to the reflectance/absorptance of good conductors. Additionally, the relationship between the Schelkunoff decomposition and another decomposition, called the mismatch decomposition in this letter, is analyzed. The mismatch decomposition consists of two loss terms closely related to reflectance/absorptance that are readily obtained from measurements.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0018-9375	1558-187X		WOS:000346716800055

DS sensitivity and operating frequency ranges are critical for many applications, including lab-on-chip development where sample volumes are small with a wide range of dynamic processes to probe. In this work, we present the design and operation considerations of radio-frequency (RF) interferometers that are based on power-dividers (PDs) and quadrature-hybrids (QHs). Such interferometers are proposed to address the sensitivity and frequency tuning challenges of current DS techniques. Verified algorithms together with mathematical models are presented to quantify material properties from scattering parameters for three common transmission line sensing structures, i.e., coplanar waveguides (CPWs), conductor-backed CPWs, and microstrip lines. A high-sensitivity and stable QH-based interferometer is demonstrated by measuring glucose-water solution at a concentration level that is ten times lower than some recent RF sensors while our sample volume is similar to 1 nL. Composition analysis of ternary mixture solutions are also demonstrated with a PD-based interferometer. Further work is needed to address issues like system automation, model improvement at high frequencies, and interferometer scaling.									12	0	0	0	0	12			0018-9480	1557-9670		WOS:000347015900031	26549891

Megan								Diversity of Limb-Bone Safety Factors for Locomotion in Terrestrial Vertebrates: Evolution and Mixed Chains								INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY				54	6			1058	1071		10.1093/icb/icu032			DEC 2014	2014	During locomotion over land, vertebrates' limb bones are exposed to loads. Like most biological structures, limb bones have a capacity to withstand greater loads than they usually experience, termed a safety factor (SF). How diverse are limb-bone SFs, and what factors correlate with such variation? We have examined these questions from two perspectives. First, we evaluated locomotor SF for the femur in diverse lineages, including salamanders, frogs, turtles, lizards, crocodilians, and marsupials (opossums). Comparisons with values for hind-limb elements in running birds and eutherian mammals indicate phylogenetic diversity in limb-bone SF. A high SF (similar to 7) is primitive for tetrapods, but low magnitudes of load and elevated strength of bones contribute to different degrees across lineages; moreover, birds and eutherians appear to have evolved lower SFs independently. Second, we tested the hypothesis that SFs would be similar across limb bones within a taxon by comparing data from the humerus and femur of alligators. Both in bending and in torsion, we found a higher SF for the humerus than for the femur. Such a "mixed chain'' of different SFs across elements has been predicted if bones have differing variabilities in load, different costs to maintain, or high SF values in general. Although variability in load is similar for the humerus and femur, a high SF may be less costly for the humerus because it is smaller than the femur. The high SFs of alligators also might facilitate differences in SF among their limb bones. Beyond these specific findings, however, a more general implication of our results is that evaluations of the diversity of limb-bone SFs can provide important perspective to direct future research. In particular, more complete understanding of variation in SF could provide insight into factors that promoted the evolutionary radiation of terrestrial locomotor function in vertebrates.

On approximating the effective bandwidth of bi-stable energy harvesters								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NON-LINEAR MECHANICS				67				153	163		10.1016/j.ijnonlinmec.2014.09.002			DEC 2014	2014	This paper aims to establish an analytical framework to define the effective bandwidth of bi-stable vibratory energy harvesters possessing a symmetric quartic potential function. To achieve this goal, the method of multiple scales is utilized to construct analytical solutions describing the amplitude and stability of the intra- and inter-well dynamics of the harvester. Using these solutions, critical bifurcations in the parameters' space are identified and used to define an effective frequency bandwidth of the harvester. The influence of three critical design parameters, namely the time constant ratio (ratio between the time constant of the harvesting circuit and the period of the mechanical system), the electromechanical coupling, and the shape of the potential function, on the effective frequency bandwidth is analyzed. It is shown that, while the time constant ratio has very little influence on the effective bandwidth of the harvester, increasing the electromechanical coupling and/or designing the potential function with deeper potential wells serve to shrink the effective bandwidth for a given level of excitation. In general, it is also observed that narrowing of the effective bandwidth is accompanied by an increase in the electric output further highlighting the competing nature of these two desired objectives.

In theory, symbiotic crustaceans should display social monogamy with long-term heterosexual pairing when hosts are relatively small in body size and structurally simple, and when hosts have relatively low abundance in habitats where the risk of mortality for symbionts (e.g., predation) away from hosts is high. We test this prediction in the mating system of the flotsam crab (Planes major) and its facultative association with loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta). First, we found that the overall population and sex distributions were non-random and crabs inhabited host turtles as heterosexual pairs more frequently than expected by chance, which supports the hypothesis that P. major is socially monogamous on C. caretta. Second, we found that male crabs pair with females regardless of their reproductive state, male-female pairs do not display size-assortative pairing, crab body size and host turtle body size are not correlated, and crabs display reverse sexual dimorphism in body size and conventional sexual dimorphism in weaponry. These results do not support the hypothesis that social monogamy in P. major is always long term. Instead, our results suggest that the duration of social monogamy in P. major is likely variable and may involve some degree of host switching and intra-sexual (mostly male-male) competition. Our results were only partially consistent with theoretical considerations for how host characteristics and ecology affect the mating systems of symbiotic crustaceans, and future studies should focus on quantifying the degree and direction of host switching to better understand the factors that affect the duration of monogamous pairing when P. major associates with C. caretta.

However, data are needed to assess the conservation value of habitats embedded in anthromes, particularly when possible conservation opportunities do not reflect the traditional focus of conservation in a region. One such region is the central Great Plains of North America where the grassland biome has been replaced by a cropland anthrome with a landscape mosaic dominated by arable crops with small patches of grass and woody cover embedded within. Grassland birds have been the primary focus of avian conservation research and practice, a reflection of the biome classification. Yet conservation of other bird species may be a missed conservation opportunity better identified via anthromes. In this project we evaluated the variation in abundance of shrubland and open forest birds in response to heterogeneity and availability of woody and grass cover at local (100 m) and landscape (5,000 m) scales. We found that local heterogeneity, a trait of croplands not grasslands, was the best predictor of abundance, with five species of conservation concern more abundant in heterogeneous sites. There was limited response to woody cover and a mixed response across scale to grassland cover with local response positive and landscape negative. These data suggest that increasing heterogeneity in the Great Plains cropland anthrome may provide a unique conservation opportunity. In particular, farm systems have the capacity to complement regional species conservation efforts by increasing heterogeneity. Importantly these conservation efforts may not come at the expense of grassland bird conservation or crop production. The limited response to extensive grassland cover at the larger scale suggests that in Great Plains agroecosystems, a diverse mix of crops, pasture, and linear habitats would allow farmers to continue to produce food while contributing to the conservation of species of concern.									4	0	0	4	0	4			0921-2973	1572-9761		WOS:000346920900014

We classified the cases when the meniscus cannot be smooth by analyzing the local behavior of the solutions to the Laplace equation of capillarity near the sharp edge. The V-angle and two contact angles that the meniscus forms on two chemically different sides of the fiber form a 3D phase space. Smooth menisci constitute a special domain in this 3D space. The constructed diagram allows one to separate the solutions with smooth and non-smooth menisci. The obtained criteria were illustrated using chemically inhomogeneous plates, blades, square corners, and Janus V-shaped edges. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This interview followed reports that Te'o had been involved in an elaborate hoax featuring a fake girlfriend. The interview was a worthy avenue of investigation as it was Te'o's first opportunity to publicly defend himself on camera following a week of ridicule and speculation by media outlets and the public. A deductive thematic analysis was conducted on Te'o's responses utilizing Benoit's image repair typology and other recently identified image repair strategies as a guide. Results revealed that Te'o did not deviate from previously established strategies by employing defeasibility, victimization, good intentions, stonewalling, retrospective regret, bolstering, shifting blame, and simple denial. Collectively, the employment of these tactics illustrated a timid, naive, and remorseful approach to image repair. While some of Te'o's choices were appropriate, the heavy use of stonewalling and victimization may have been ineffective in changing audience perception. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Retrofit programs for these at-risk buildings have been proposed with the first such program in a major city mandated in San Francisco in 2013. In this paper, a seismic retrofit methodology for soft-story woodframe buildings is presented. The methodology utilizes seismic response modification devices that consist of a compact steel section for energy dissipation and shape memory alloy (SMA) wire for re-centering capability, should that be needed. The device can be installed within a scissor-jack brace which is known for its compact footprint and high displacement magnification factor. These characteristics make it suitable mainly because of the need for placement in or near short wall segments characteristic of the bottom floor of soft-story woodframe buildings. The retrofit methodology using the SMA-steel device in a scissor-jack brace was developed and exemplified on a three-story soft-story woodframe building. Nonlinear time history analysis was conducted to quantify the performance of the retrofitted building for a suite of earthquakes. Experimental validation consisted of a full-scale hybrid test of the three-story building with the seismic retrofit represented numerically in the first-story serving as the numerical substructure, and the upper two stories represented physically in the laboratory. The results of the full-scale hybrid test are presented thereby validating the proposed seismic retrofit using SMA-steel devices in scissor-jack braces. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

First, explicit analytic solutions for switching functions' implicit equations, which are, utilised in modulating of the SMCs operated under phase disposition phase shifted carrier pulse width modulation (PD-PSC-PWM) technique whereas being initiated from the Kepler's transcendental equation, are derived. Next, utilising above-mentioned calculated Kapteyn (Fourier-Bessel)-based infinite series, a time-variant differential equation-based analytical model for single/three-phase SMCs is suggested. This strategy reduces to a model that can facilitate the analytic investigation of the start-up behaviour, dynamic response and natural voltage balancing phenomenon for SMCs owning any number of voltage-levels and phase numbers. Furthermore, it is also inferred that under the PD-PSC-PWM modulation technique, the flying-capacitor (FC) voltages balance naturally for higher number of stacks and cells, hence substantiating that the natural balancing exists for high-level SMCs. Moreover, precise analysis of the experimental observations reveals that settling time of the FC voltages in the positive and negative stacks positioned in the immediate vicinity of the SMC's midpoint is higher than the settling time of the FC voltages in the correspondent positive and negative stacks outlying the SMC's midpoint.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1755-4535	1755-4543		WOS:000346253000009

The models considered are: a simplistic geometry considering a single organ, a more specific geometry employing additional organs with anatomically relevant size and location, and voxel reconstruction of internal anatomy obtained from CT imaging (referred to as CSUTROUT). Dose Conversion Factors (DCFs) for whole body as well as selected organs of O. mykiss were computed using Monte Carlo modeling, and combined with estimated activity concentrations, to approximate dose rates and ultimately determine cumulative radiation dose (mu Gy) to selected organs after several half-lives of I-131. The different computational models provided similar results, especially for source organs (less than 30% difference between estimated doses), and whole body DCFs for each model (similar to 3 x 10(-3) mu Gy d(-1) per Bq kg(-1)) were comparable to DCFs listed in ICRP 108 for I-131. The main benefit provided by the computational models developed here is the ability to accurately determine organ dose. A conservative mass-ratio approach may provide reasonable results for sufficiently large organs, but is only applicable to individual source organs. Although CSUTROUT is the more anatomically realistic phantom, it required much more resource dedication to develop and is less flexible than the stylized phantom for similar results. There may be instances where a detailed phantom such as CSUTROUT is appropriate, but generally the stylized phantom appears to be the best choice for an ideal balance between accuracy and resource requirements.

Current assessment of osteoporosis is typically based on bone densitometry tools such as Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT) and Dual Energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). These assessment modalities mainly rely on estimating the bone mineral density (BMD). Hence present densitometry tools describe only the deterioration of the quantity of bone associated with the disease and not the affected morphology or microstructural changes, resulting in potential incomplete assessment, many undetected patients, and unexplained fractures. In this study, an in-silico parametric model of vertebral trabecular bone incorporating both material and microstructural parameters was developed towards the accurate assessment of osteoporosis and the consequent risk of bone fracture. The model confirms that the mechanical properties such as strength and stiffness of vertebral trabecular tissue are highly influenced by material properties as well as morphology characteristics such as connectivity, which reflects the quality of connected inter-trabecular parts. The FE cellular solid model presented here provides a holistic approach that incorporates both material and microstructural elements associated with the degenerative process, and hence has the potential to provide clinical practitioners and researchers with more accurate assessment method for the degenerative changes leading to inferior mechanical properties and increased fracture risk associated with age and/or disease such as Osteoporosis.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0954-4119	2041-3033		WOS:000346594900008

A New Seismic Site Coefficient Model Based on Conditions in the South Carolina Coastal Plain								BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA				104	6			2866	2883		10.1785/0120140005			DEC 2014	2014	A new seismic site coefficient model is developed in this article from the results of over 48,000 total stress, 1D equivalent linear and nonlinear ground response simulations assuming conditions at seven locations in the South Carolina Coastal Plain. Site coefficients (F) computed from the simulations are plotted versus average shear-wave velocity in the top 30 m (V-S30) and grouped by location, spectral acceleration, and spectral period. In all plots, it can be seen that F increases from zero to a zone of peak values as V-S30 increases from zero, and then F decreases to a value of 1 as V-S30 approaches the reference soft-rock value. Variables found to be most influential on F, in addition to V-S30 and spectral acceleration, are stiffness of material in the top 100 m, depth to top of rock, and frequency content of the rock outcrop motion. A mathematical model for median values of F defined by these five variables is proposed. Significant differences exist between the new seismic site coefficient model and the site coefficients commonly assumed in current seismic design codes, particularly where V-S30 is <180 m/s and where the top of the rock is at shallow depths. The new model is partially validated using data from the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Because the new model is based on a broad range of soil/rock properties, it should be applicable to other areas with similar conditions and may be applicable in areas with different conditions if the model variables are appropriately calibrated or modified.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0037-1106	1943-3573		WOS:000346136800017

Across all fields, densities averaged 7.2 +/- 0.5 (SEM) adults and 4.5 +/- 0.4 nymphs per 20 sweeps and 5.5 +/- 0.3 adults and 4.5 +/- 0.3 nymphs per 1.83 m of row. Coefficients of Taylor's power law were used to generate sampling plans for population estimates and sequential sampling plans for pest management decision making. At an economic threshold of one nymph per sweep, optimum sample sizes were 184, 48, and 22 within 10, 20, and 30% of the mean with the sweep-net method. At the corresponding threshold for the beat cloth (24.7 nymphs per 1.83 m of row), optimum sample sizes were 239, 62, and 29 within 10, 20 and 30% of the mean, respectively. At all adult and nymph densities, fewer sweep-net samples were required for population estimations compared with the number of beat-cloth samples. Sequential sampling reduced the sample size required to reach a management decision for the sweep net and beat cloth compared with a fixed sampling plan. The sweep-net method was more cost reliable for population estimation at low densities of both life stages, with the beat cloth becoming more cost reliable as populations increased. The beat-cloth method was more cost reliable than sweep-net sampling across all densities and life stages for pest management practices. These results may be used by researchers, county Extension agents, consultants, and farm managers to both facilitate sampling and improve reliability of M. cribraria estimates for research purposes and for pest management.									5	0	0	4	0	5			0022-0493	1938-291X		WOS:000345963300025	26470088

Identifying Priority Species and Conservation Opportunities Under Future Climate Scenarios: Amphibians in a Biodiversity Hotspot								JOURNAL OF FISH AND WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT				5	2			282	297		10.3996/022014-JFWM-015			DEC 2014	2014	Climate change is driving shifts in the distribution of plants and animals, and prioritizing management actions for such shifts is a necessary but technically difficult challenge. We worked with state agencies in the southeastern United States to identify high-priority amphibian species, to model the vulnerabilities of those species to regional climate change, and to identify long-term climatic refugia within the context of existing conservation lands. Directly interfacing with state natural resource experts ensured that 1) species prioritization schemes extend beyond political boundaries and 2) our models resulted in conservation-relevant applications. We used a correlative model to project midcentury distributions of suitable climate for priority species and to evaluate each species' vulnerability to climate change. Using spatially explicit projected climate distributions, we ranked existing protected areas relative to their ability to provide climatic refugia for priority species in 2050. We identified 21 species as regional high-priority species. Fifteen of the 21 species are forecast to lose more than 85% of their climatically suitable habitat. Regions in the Appalachian Mountains, the Florida Panhandle, and the north-central region of Alabama are projected to lose the most climatic habitat for priority amphibian species. We identified many existing protected areas as midcentury climatic refugia in the Appalachians; however, our projections indicated refugia in the Southeast Coastal Plain to be exceedingly scarce. Although the topographic relief present in the Appalachians appears to provide future conservation opportunities via climatic refugia, the Coastal Plain affords fewer such opportunities and conservation of amphibians in that region is likely to be more challenging. The approach outlined here could be applied across a broad range of taxa and regions.									4	0	0	3	0	4			1944-687X			WOS:000346052300008

Kenneth								Loading characteristics and chemical stability of headgroup-functionalized poly(ethylene glycol)-lipid ligand tethers on polypropylene capillary-channeled polymer fibers								JOURNAL OF SEPARATION SCIENCE				37	24			3595	3602		10.1002/jssc.201400807			DEC 2014	2014	Polypropylene capillary-channeled polymer fibers have been modified by adsorption of headgroup-functionalized poly(ethylene glycol)-lipids to generate a species-specific stationary phase. In order to study ligand binding characteristics, a fluorescein-labeled poly(ethylene glycol)-lipid was used as a model system. Breakthrough curves and frontal analysis were employed to characterize the surface loading characteristics across a range of lipid concentrations and mobile phase flow rates. Efficient mass transfer and fluid transport yield a linear adsorption isotherm up to the maximum loading concentration of 3 mg/mL, at a linear velocity of 57.1 mm/s. Under these conditions, the dynamic binding capacity was found to be 1.52 mg/g of fiber support. Variation of the linear velocity from 8.6 to 57.1 mm/s showed only small changes in breakthrough volume. The maximum capacity of 1.8 mg/g is found under conditions of a load velocity of 34.2 mm/s and a concentration of 3 mg/mL lipid. Exposure of the lipid modified fibers to several challenge solvents reveals a chemically robust system, with only 50% acetonitrile and hexanes able to disrupt the lipid adsorption. The straightforward capillary-channeled polymer fiber surface modification with headgroup-functionalized lipids provides both a diverse yet practically robust ligand tethering system.									7	0	0	4	0	7			1615-9306	1615-9314		WOS:000346056200001	25284707

In addition, the effect of surface charge of the nanocarriers on penetration was also studied. Particularly, corn oil-nanoemulsions (NE) and chitosan coated NE (CH-NE) were successfully prepared with a high encapsulation efficiency, a high payload, a very small size, a small polydispersity index, and a high zeta potential. However, after being coated with chitosan, the zeta potential of NE changed from a negative charge to a positive charge. Penetration experiments were also carried out using a Franz diffusion cell followed by visualization using confocal laser scanning microscopy. The images of the vertical sections illustrated that penetration of nanocarriers (NE and CH-NE) into the red pepper leaf occurred very quickly. Nanocarriers fully penetrated the whole leaf after 60 min. Moreover, multi-depth images that paralleled the leaf surface (horizontal visualization) together with removal of plant-autofluorescent emissions and three-dimensional graphs describing the penetration of NE and CH-NE demonstrated that the negatively charged nanocarriers (NE) had a higher penetration rate compared to that of the positively charged nanocarriers (CH-NE).

This suggests that getting European Union (EU) citizens to identify with Europe will decrease outgroup hostility. Is European identity thus a superordinate identity? Using Eurobarometer data, I determine which level of identification is the most inclusive for individuals' immigration attitudes. Those who feel European hold more favorable views toward immigrantsan effect that is amplified under conditions of cross-cutting cleavages and where country length of European Union membership is greatest. In contrast, strong national identity is associated with more negative immigration attitudes; regional identity has no effect. A subsequent test confirms that the benefits of identifying with Europe extend most strongly to immigrants of European Union origin, although positive effects are observed toward non-European Union migrants as well.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1465-1165	1741-2757		WOS:000345460900004

Ultrahigh ac deflection responsivity has also been observed, which reached a maximum value of 140 mu V/nm at a gate bias of 2.3 V, consuming only 51 mu W of power.									3	0	0	2	0	3			0741-3106	1558-0563		WOS:000345575400046

In general, drivers are not aware of the optimal velocity profile for a given route. Indeed, the global optimal velocity trajectory depends on many factors, and its calculation requires intensive computations. In this paper, we discuss the optimization of the speed trajectory to minimize fuel consumption and communicate it to the driver. With this information the driver can adjust his/her speed profile to reduce the overall fuel consumption. We propose to perform the computation-intensive calculations on a distinct computing platform called the "cloud." In our approach, the driver sends the information of the intended travel destination to the cloud. In the cloud, the server generates a route, collects the associated traffic and geographical information, and solves the optimization problem by a spatial domain dynamic programming (DP) algorithm that utilizes accurate vehicle and fuel consumption models to determine the optimal speed trajectory along the route. Then, the server sends the speed trajectory to the vehicle where it is communicated to the driver. We tested the approach on a prototype vehicle equipped with a visual interface mounted on the dash of a test vehicle. The test results show 5%-15% improvement in fuel economy depending on the driver and route without a significant effect on the travel time. Although this paper implements the speed advisory system in a conventional vehicle, the solution is generic, and it is applicable to any kind of powertrain structure.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1524-9050	1558-0016		WOS:000345572900012		
J	Mahler, Grant; Vahidi, Ardalan								An Optimal Velocity-Planning Scheme for Vehicle Energy Efficiency Through Probabilistic Prediction of Traffic-Signal Timing								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS				15	6			2516	2523		10.1109/TITS.2014.2319306			DEC 2014	2014	The main contribution of this paper is the formulation of a predictive optimal velocity-planning algorithm that uses probabilistic traffic-signal phase and timing (SPAT) information to increase a vehicle's energy efficiency. We introduce a signal-phase prediction model that uses historically averaged timing data and real-time phase data to determine the probability of green for upcoming traffic lights. In an optimal control framework, we then calculate the best velocity trajectory that maximizes the chance of going through green lights. The case study results from a multisignal simulation indicating that energy efficiency can be increased with probabilistic timing data and real-time phase data. Monte Carlo simulations are used to confirm that the case study results are valid, on average. Finally, simulated vehicles are driven through a series of traffic signals, using recorded data from a real-world set of traffic-adaptive signals, to determine the applicability of these predictive models to various types of traffic signals.									11	2	0	1	0	13			1524-9050	1558-0016		WOS:000345572900014

Razor blade shear method for evaluating duck breast meat and tendon texture								JOURNAL OF APPLIED POULTRY RESEARCH				23	4			742	747		10.3382/japr.2013-00905			DEC 2014	2014	Ducks are a small but important portion of the US poultry industry, and are a much larger proportion of the poultry markets in other countries. More duck meat fillet products enter the further processing market, yet few studies have been conducted on meat quality characteristics. Therefore, this project was conducted to determine the effects of sex, bird size, and marination treatment on breast (pectoralis major) fillet weight, cook yield, and Warner-Bratzler (WB) shear values. Razor shear was also used to isolate connective tissue in the breast meat that is typically responsible for consumer complaints regarding toughness. Ducks were identified at 1 d of age for sex, processed at 35 d of age in a commercial facility, and carcasses were categorized as small (1.6 kg), medium (2.0 kg), or large (2.5 kg). Breast fillets (120, 20 each from 2 sexes and 3 sizes) were divided and 60 were marinated using vacuum tumbling whereas 60 were left unmarinated. All of the fillets were then weighed, cooked, and reweighed to determine cook yield. Razor shear was conducted on 2 areas within each fillet and another 2 razor shear measurements were taken on each fillet directly through the connective tissue near the wing insertion. A section of each fillet was then removed for a 2-slice WB shear. Carcass size from small to large corresponded to an increase in raw fillet weight. Fillets from males required more razor shear force than fillets from females. Marination improved cook yield and reduced both the WB shear values and the razor shear values for the meat and the tendon. The razor shear method was effective at measuring both duck meat texture and tendon toughness.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1056-6171	1537-0437		WOS:000345563600018

Unregulated competitive markets have two effects: they produce deadweight losses, and they redistribute income away from biased consumers. Both unbiased and naive consumers believe that they benefit from this redistribution (the naive consumers are wrong), so support for efficiency-improving regulation is limited. Extending our model to consumers with partial sophistication about their naivete, we predict patterns of regulation consistent with the form and timing of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act of 2009.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1542-4766	1542-4774		WOS:000345595500006

A four sheet multilayer rolling scheme was used to isolate shear strains within the outer sheets, termed isolated shear rolling (ISR), thus allowing for direct comparison between shear strained material (outer sheets) and plane-strained material under similar conditions. Microstructure and texture evolution were investigated by electron backscatter diffraction analysis, while mechanical properties were evaluated through tensile testing aided by digital image correlation (DIC). Texture was seen to evolve from a +/- 30 degrees transverse direction (TD) split basal texture to primarily basal texture ((0001)//Normal Direction) for the shear-strained sheets, in comparison with a slight rotation to a +/- 20 degrees TD-split for the plane-strained sheets. After short-term annealing at 600 degrees C for 15 min, texture remained similar to that of the as-processed material yet at lower intensity levels. Compared to the base material, shear-rolled material showed much higher Lankford Coefficient values, with a significant boost attributed to shear deformation. The greater stretch formability is achieved in the shear-rolled material by rotation of the basal poles to become parallel to the sheet thickness. The results obtained here with ISR in regards to the effects of inducing higher shear strains on the rolled material are comparable to those reported in the literature by differential speed rolling (DSR).

Ferrofluids are stable magnetic nanoparticles suspensions. Under external magnetic field gradients, particles with a larger magnetization within the ferrofluids are attracted to a magnet while the ones with a smaller magnetization are pushed away from it. Based on this principle, we report the design, modeling, fabrication, and characterization of the separation device and use it to separate magnetic and non-magnetic particles, as well as particles with different magnetizations. This scheme is simple, cost-effective, and label-free compared to other existing techniques.									21	0	0	6	0	21			1613-4982	1613-4990		WOS:000345389900001

This test involved 150 participants examining packaging images showing the product name in various point sizes and being asked their preference. A cascading presentation method modelled after the binary search algorithm was used to determine the exact point size preference for each participant. Participants also completed a survey intended to gather information regarding their motives for their choice. This study was developed to determine the optimal display type size of a package on the basis of its relationship with the package's proportions. It was hypothesized that this proportion would be related to the golden ratio (a ratio of about two-thirds) that has been suggested to be a particularly aesthetic proportion throughout nature and human history. The results of the study showed that the preferred ratio was actually greater than the golden ratio, equaling 10/12 of the package's width. These results were found to be further influenced by the participant's gender and the packaging structure on which the display type is applied. Although the results are not generalizable to all demographics and products, the methodology used is easily extensible to arbitrary product types. We propose that this methodology for evaluating type size on packages be used by designers as part of the package creation process.

Responses of Planktothrix agardhii and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata to Copper Sulfate (CuSO4 center dot 5H2O) and a Chelated Copper Compound (Cutrine (R)-Ultra)								WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION				225	12					2231	10.1007/s11270-014-2231-3			DEC 2014	2014	Reliable viability measures are needed to predict responses of algae to phytotoxic exposures. Non-axenic laboratory cultures of Planktothrix agardhii and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata were exposed to a series of concentrations of CuSO4 center dot 5H2O (0.1-0.5 and 1.0-8.0 mg Cu/L) and a chelated copper compound with an adjuvant, Cutrine (R)-Ultra (0.05-0.25 and 1.0-8.0 mg Cu/L) in 7-day static laboratory experiments. Algal viability measures in terms of cell density, uptake of mortal stain (erythrosin b), chlorophyll a concentration, pheophytin a concentration, and respiration (measured as 2-(p-iodophenyl)-3-(p-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyl tetrazolium formazan absorbance (INT)) were discerned daily. The time and concentration required to achieve algal control, 96-h EC50s, potency slopes, and doubling times were calculated from algal responses if algal viability measures were accurate and precise. Cell densities and erythrosin b-stained cells had sufficient accuracy and precision to differentiate responses of P. agardhii and P. subcapitata from resident algae while chlorophyll a concentrations and INT formazan absorbances did not discriminate. In this study, pheophytin a concentrations lack precision and accuracy. P. agardhii was an order of magnitude more sensitive than P. subcapitata, and Cutrine (R)-Ultra was more than twice as potent as CuSO4 center dot 5H2O. This laboratory study corroborates previous laboratory and field studies suggesting that chelated copper-based algaecides when applied in the field can selectively control specific target algae at a lower copper concentration than CuSO4 center dot 5H2O. Individual algal viability measures such as cell density and erythrosin b staining can measure the relevant change in algal assemblage as a result of exposure.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0049-6979	1573-2932		WOS:000345320200023

The presence of chemical species in a protein solution with strong absorbance within this range can interfere with the ability to use these methods for the determination of the protein's helical structure. The objective of this research was to overcome this problem by developing a method for CD spectral analysis that relies on spectral features above this wavelength range. In this study, we determined that the slopes of CD spectra acquired over the 230 to 240 nm region strongly correlate with the helix contents including alpha-helix and 3(10)-helix of protein as determined using conventional CD algorithms that rely on wavelengths between 190 and 230 nm. This approach (i.e., the 230-240 nm slope method) is proposed as an effective method to determine the helix content within proteins in the presence of additives such as detergents or denaturants with high absorbance of wavelengths up to 230 nm.

However, the quality of their geometric embedding and the sole dependence on the input scalar field data can limit their applicability when expressing application-dependent features. In this paper we introduce a new combinatorial technique to compute an MS complex that conforms to both an input scalar field and an additional, prior segmentation of the domain. The segmentation constrains the MS complex computation guaranteeing that boundaries in the segmentation are captured as separatrices of the MS complex. We demonstrate the utility and versatility of our approach with two applications. First, we use streamline integration to determine numerically computed basins/mountains and use the resulting segmentation as an input to our algorithm. This strategy enables the incorporation of prior flow path knowledge, effectively resulting in an MS complex that is as geometrically accurate as the employed numerical integration. Our second use case is motivated by the observation that often the data itself does not explicitly contain features known to be present by a domain expert. We introduce edit operations for MS complexes so that a user can directly modify their features while maintaining all the advantages of a robust topology-based representation.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1077-2626	1941-0506		WOS:000344991700105	26356973

Consistent with our predictions, we found that employees reporting high levels of co-worker exclusion and high levels of perceived organizational support demonstrate higher levels of performance and increased levels of self-worth than those reporting low levels of POS. Alternatively, support from family or friends intensified the negative relationship between co-worker exclusion and self-esteem and the positive relationship between co-worker exclusion and job-induced tension. Unexpectedly, FSS did not influence the supervisor-rated task performance of excluded workers, nor did POS mitigate the relationship between co-worker exclusion and job-induced tension. Implications for theory, research, and practice are discussed.									6	1	0	0	0	7			0022-2380	1467-6486		WOS:000345175900001

Asymptotic distribution of motifs in a stochastic context-free grammar model of RNA folding								JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY				69	6-7			1743	1772		10.1007/s00285-013-0750-y			DEC 2014	2014	We analyze the distribution of RNA secondary structures given by the Knudsen-Hein stochastic context-free grammar used in the prediction program Pfold. Our main theorem gives relations between the expected number of these motifs-independent of the grammar probabilities. These relations are a consequence of proving that the distribution of base pairs, of helices, and of different types of loops is asymptotically Gaussian in this model of RNA folding. Proof techniques use singularity analysis of probability generating functions. We also demonstrate that these asymptotic results capture well the expected number of RNA base pairs in native ribosomal structures, and certain other aspects of their predicted secondary structures. In particular, we find that the predicted structures largely satisfy the expected relations, although the native structures do not.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0303-6812	1432-1416		WOS:000344917300015	24384698

LSPR substrates comprised of self-assembled, 2D arrays of AgNPs exhibit coherent plasmon coupling manifested as a sharp peak in the blue spectral region. A bottom-up approach was used to fabricate reproducible and cost-effective substrates with a figure of merit (FOM) of similar to 24. The LSPR shift was determined by measuring the difference between light extinction at two wavelengths selected on each side of the sharp peak. The sharpness of the coherent plasmon resonance together with the differential measurement method enabled a record sensing resolution in bulk for a LSPR sensor of similar to 4.8E-6 RIU.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1557-1955	1557-1963		WOS:000345146800017

Patient history, lesion morphology, enhancement pattern and kinetics, and T-2 characteristics were examined.Results: The PPV3 of all BI-RADS 4 and 5 breast lesions seen on MRI was 22.6% (26 of 115). Excluding lesions with second-look imaging correlates decreased the PPV3 to 11.8% (6/51). Of the MRI-guided biopsies, 20.9% (24 of 115) yielded a high-risk lesion, altering surgical management. MRI lesion type did not significantly affect the PPV3: the PPV3 was 26.3% (15 of 57) for masses, 21.4% (9 of 42) for non mass enhancement (NME) and 12.5% (2 of 16) for suspicious foci. The PPV3 for lesions found on diagnostic MRI in women with newly diagnosed cancer was 30.8% (20 of 65) which was statistically significantly greater compared to a PPV3 of 11.9% (5 of 42) for lesions identified on high-risk screening MRI.Conclusions: Suspicious MRI findings identified on a second-look examination are more likely malignant than those seen only on MRI. Suspicious MRI findings discovered in patients with concurrent malignancy have a greater PPV3 than those detected on high-risk screening MRIs. However, the type of MRI finding (mass vs. NME vs. foci) does not significantly affect the PPV3 and should not be used as a discriminator for determining biopsy threshold.									2	0	0	0	1	3			1076-6332	1878-4046		WOS:000344844400009	25262952

Synthetic control of the cis/trans geometry of [M(cyclam)(CCR)(2)]OTf complexes and photophysics of cis-[Cr(cyclam)(CCCF3)(2)]OTf and cis-Rh(cyclam)(CCCF3)(2)]OTf								JOURNAL OF ORGANOMETALLIC CHEMISTRY				772				107	112		10.1016/j.jorganchem.2014.08.028			DEC 1 2014	2014	During the synthesis of alkynyl complexes of the type [Cr(cyclam)(CCR)(2)]OTf from cis-[Cr(cyclam)(OTf)(2)] OTf, a cis to trans isomerization occurs that is dependent on the identity of the ether solvent. The isomerization occurs to a significant extent in THF, yielding greater than 80% of the trans isomer, whereas in diethyl ether this isomerization occurs to a lesser extent. Though some base catalyzed isomerization of the final alkynyl product occurs, the data herein supports that the majority of the isomerization occurs during the triflate to alkynyl ligand exchange. It is also demonstrated that 1,1,1,3,3-pentafluoropropane can be used in place of the more expensive 1,1,1-trifluoropropyne for the syntheses of the trifluoropropynyl complexes, cis/trans-IM(cyclam)(CCCF3)(2)OTf. The methodologies developed are used to prepare the previously unreported cis-IM(cyclam)(CCCF3)(2)OTf complexes (where M = Cr3+ and Rh-3). Upon photoexcitation, the Cr3+ complex is emissive (738 nm) in room temperature acetonitrile with lifetimes of 24 is and 122 is in air saturated and nitrogen purged solutions respectively. The corresponding Rh3+ complex is non-emissive. (c) 2014 Elsevier BY. All rights reserved.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0022-328X	1872-8561		WOS:000344470100014

I model a scoring auction showing how ex post revisions skew bidding decisions and estimate unit costs from bid data using the method of sieve estimation. The results highlight the cost implications of incomplete contracting frictions, subcontracting decisions, and bidding distortions.

Senate Responsiveness to Minority Constituencies: Latino Electoral Strength and Representation								SOCIAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY				95	4			1172	1188		10.1111/ssqu.12093			DEC 2014	2014	Objective. While most research on minority representation in Congress finds that the African-American constituency size influences representation of the group's interests, most recent studies examining Latinos find no such relationship. We argue that the failure to find a relationship stems from the focus of prior research on the proportion of the Latino population in the total geographic constituency rather than the proportion of Latinos in the electoral constituency, what we term "Latino electoral strength" (LES). Methods. Using data on Latino turnout at the state level, we examine the effect of LES on representation of Latino interests in the U. S. Senate. We use ordinary least squares (OLS) regression that accounts for the time serial, cross-sectional (TSCS) nature of our data. Results. Consistent with other studies, we find no influence of Latino population size on Latino representation. However, LES has a significant, negative effect on Latino representation. Conclusions. Our results suggest that greater LES leads to worse representation of their interests, and that this relationship increases as LES grows. This is consistent with existing studies of racial threat theory.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0038-4941	1540-6237		WOS:000344555900016

Platform Technologies for Decellularization, Tunic-Specific Cell Seeding, and In Vitro Conditioning of Extended Length, Small Diameter Vascular Grafts								TISSUE ENGINEERING PART C-METHODS				20	12			1016	1027		10.1089/ten.tec.2014.0047			DEC 1 2014	2014	The aim of this study was to generate extended length, small diameter vascular scaffolds that could serve as potential grafts for treatment of acute ischemia. Biological tissues are considered excellent scaffolds, which exhibit adequate biological, mechanical, and handling properties; however, they tend to degenerate, dilate, and calcify after implantation. We hypothesized that chemically stabilized acellular arteries would be ideal scaffolds for development of vascular grafts for peripheral surgery applications. Based on promising historical data from our laboratory and others, we chose to decellularize bovine mammary and femoral arteries and test them as scaffolds for vascular grafting. Decellularization of such long structures required development of a novel "bioprocessing" system and a sequence of detergents and enzymes that generated completely acellular, galactose-(alpha 1,3)-galactose (alpha-Gal) xenoantigen-free scaffolds with preserved collagen, elastin, and basement membrane components. Acellular arteries exhibited excellent mechanical properties, including burst pressure, suture holding strength, and elastic recoil. To reduce elastin degeneration, we treated the scaffolds with penta-galloyl glucose and then revitalized them in vitro using a tunic-specific cell approach. A novel atraumatic endothelialization protocol using an external stent was also developed for the long grafts and cell-seeded constructs were conditioned in a flow bioreactor. Both decellularization and revitalization are feasible but cell retention in vitro continues to pose challenges. These studies support further efforts toward clinical use of small diameter acellular arteries as vascular grafts.									5	0	0	5	0	5			1937-3384	1937-3392		WOS:000345269800009	24749889

Pre-oxidation of the NDMA precursors prior to chloramination can be a viable approach for water utilities to control the NDMA levels. This study examined the effects of (i) commonly used oxidants (i.e., chlorine, chlorine dioxide and ozone) in water treatment, (ii) oxidant concentration and contact time (CT), and (iii) pre-oxidation pH on the formation of NDMA from subsequent chloramination. Fifteen model precursors with NDMA molar yields ranging from approximately 0.1%-90% were examined. Pre-chlorination reduced NDMA formation from most precursors by 10%-50% except quaternary amine polymers (i.e., PolyDADMAC, PolyACRYL, PolyAMINE). Pre-oxidation with chlorine dioxide and ozone achieved the same or higher deactivation of NDMA precursors (e.g., ranitidine) while increasing NDMA formation for some other precursors (e.g., daminozid). The increases with chlorine dioxide exposure were attributed to the release of oxidation products with dimethylamine (DMA) moiety, which may form more NDMA upon chloramination than the unoxidizied parent compound. On the other hand, chlorine dioxide was effective, if a precursors NDMA yield were higher than DMA. The ozone-triggered increases could be related to direct NDMA formation from DMA which are released by zonation of amines with DMA moiety, amides or hydrazines. However, hydroxyl radicals formed from the decomposition of ozone would be also involved in decomposition of formed NDMA, reducing the overall NDMA levels at longer contact times. pH conditions influenced significantly the effectiveness of deactivation of precursors depending on the type of precursor and oxidant used.

J	Mierzejewski, Jessica; Haney, Dennis C.; van den Hurk, Peter								Biomarker responses in sunfish species and largemouth bass from the Saluda River, South Carolina								ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY				110				8	15		10.1016/j.ecoenv.2014.08.003			DEC 2014	2014	The upstate and Piedmont region of South Carolina is a rapidly urbanizing area as a result of a steadily growing population. This increase in population and development has the potential to negatively impact local aquatic systems like the Saluda River due to increased pollution from runoff, and effluents from industrial and wastewater treatment facilities. During the summer months of 2010, 159 fish from the Centrarchidae family (sunfish species (Lepomis) and largemouth bass - Micropterus salmoides) were collected from 13 sites along the Saluda River. A suite of biomarker assays, including ethoxyresosufin-O-deethylase, bile fluorescence, glutathione S-transferase, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, bile estrogens, acetylcholinesterase inhibition, metallothionein and tissue metal levels were applied to investigate the impacts of diminished water quality on fish health. Results indicate that fish from the Saluda River are responding to contamination in a site specific manner, with up to four significant biomarker responses in the most impacted sites. Sampling sites in the lower portion of the Saluda watershed are less impacted by pollution than the upper and central sections. The observed biomarker responses can be explained by the proximity of urban areas, point sources and general land use, and demonstrate the applicability of biomarkers in environmental biomonitoring programs.

Preferential sorption of some natural organic matter fractions to titanium dioxide nanoparticles: influence of pH and ionic strength								ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT				186	12			8833	8844		10.1007/s10661-014-4047-4			DEC 2014	2014	Natural organic matter (NOM) sorption to nanoparticles (NPs) can influence their transport and bioavailability in the aquatic environment. The sorption affinity of NOM to surfaces including NPs is size dependent, and depending on environmental conditions, NOM may enhance or mitigate NPs toxicity. The aim of this study was to investigate the preferential sorption of different-sized fractions of NOM to titanium dioxide (TiO2) NPs. We specifically investigated the influence of pH, ionic strength, and NOM concentration on the extent of this preferential sorption using a constant sorbent concentration (400 mg/L TiO2 NPs). Additionally, sorption of NOM to TiO2 NPs at varying pH was investigated. The nonsorbed NOM was separated from the sorbed, by 50 nm polycarbonate membrane filters and ultracentrifugation. High-performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) was used to determine the average molecular weights of NOM (MWw). Corroborative evidence of preferential sorption of different-sized molecular weight fractions of NOM was obtained from optical techniques such as absorbance and fluorescence spectrophotometry. The total organic carbon was measured by the Total Organic Carbon Analyzer-Shimadzu (TOC-VCPH). The results indicated that there is preferential sorption of larger sized fractions of NOM to TiO2 NPs irrespective of NOM concentration. It was observed that the sorption of larger sized fractions of NOM was much enhanced at lower pH and at higher ionic strength. Both absorbance and fluorescence spectrophotometric techniques gave credible corroborative evidence on the extent of preferential sorption of lager sized fractions of NOM with respect to pH and ionic strength. The sorption results demonstrated higher sorption at lower pH than at higher pH. Overall, the results of this study suggest that the environmental conditions are key factors that can contribute to NOM's fractional preferential sorption to NPs in the aquatic environment.									6	1	0	6	0	6			0167-6369	1573-2959		WOS:000344349200057	25213564

Destruction of the NP extracellular matrix (ECM) is observed during the early stages of IVD degeneration. Herein, we describe the development and initial characterization of a novel biomaterial which attempts to recreate the resilient and hydrophilic nature of the NP via the construction of a chemically stabilized elastin-glycosaminoglycan-collagen (EGC) composite hydrogel. Results demonstrated that a resilient, hydrophilic hydrogel which displays a unique shape-memory sponge characteristic could be formed from a blend of soluble elastin aggregates, chondroitin-6-sulfate, hyaluronic acid and collagen following freeze-drying, stabilization with a carbodiimide and penta-galloyl glucose-based fixative, and subsequent partial degradation with glycosaminoglycan degrading enzymes. The resultant material exhibited the ability to restore its original dimensions and water content following multi-cycle mechanical compression and illustrated resistance to accelerated enzymatic degradation. Preliminary in vitro studies utilizing human adipose derived stem cells (hADSCs) demonstrated that the material was cytocompatible and supported differentiation towards an NP cell-like phenotype. In vivo biocompatibility studies illustrated host cell infiltration and evidence of active remodeling following 4 weeks of implantation. Feasibility studies demonstrated that the EGC hydrogel could be delivered via minimally invasive methods. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Freeform Vertical and Horizontal Fabrication of Alginate-Based Vascular-Like Tubular Constructs Using Inkjetting								JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME				136	6	SI				061020	10.1115/1.4028578			DEC 2014	2014	Organ printing, among different tissue engineering innovations, is a freeform fabrication approach for making three-dimensional (3D) tissue and organ constructs using cellular spheroids or bioinks as building blocks. The capability to fabricate vascular-like tubular constructs is an important indicator of the overall feasibility of envisioned organ printing technology. In this study, vascular-like alginate tubes, which mimic typical vascular constructs, are fabricated both vertically and horizontally using drop-on-demand (DOD) inkjetting. Manufacturing-related challenges are different for the vertical and horizontal printing configurations. In general, the vertical printing configuration has instability or collapse/buckling problems and may experience some difficulty in fabricating complex constructs such as Y- or K-shaped constructs if there is no supporting material. The horizontal printing configuration may easily result in a deformed hollow cross section and may require extra effort to mitigate the undesired deformation. It is envisioned that the combination of vertical and horizontal printing provides an efficient and effective way to fabricate complex tubular constructs with both vertical and horizontal branching features.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1087-1357	1528-8935		WOS:000344393000022

Examples include mean level shifts and volatility (variance) changes. Climate data, for example, is replete with mean shift changepoints, occurring whenever a recording instrument is changed or the observing station is moved. Here, we consider the problem of incorporating known changepoint times into a regression model framework. Specifically, we establish consistency and asymptotic normality of ordinary least squares regression estimators that account for an arbitrary number of mean shifts in the record. In a sense, this provides an alternative to the customary infill asymptotics for regression models that assume an asymptotic infinity of data observations between all changepoint times.

MMS with discontinuities further complicates the problem of determining these values. In an effort to adapt the standard MMS procedure to solutions that contain discontinuities we show that Newton-Cotes and Gauss quadrature numerical integration methods exhibit high error, first order limitations. We propose a new method for determining the exact solutions and source terms on a uniform structured grid containing shock discontinuities by performing linearly and quadratically exact transformations on split cells. Transformations are performed on triangular and quadrilateral elements of a systematically divided discontinuous cell. Using a quadratic transformation in conjunction with a nine point Gauss quadrature method, a minimum of 4th order accuracy is achieved for fully general solutions and shock shapes. A linear approximation of curved shocks is also experimentally shown to be 2nd order accurate. The numerical integration method is then applied to a CFD code using simple discontinuous manufactured solutions which return consistent 1st order convergence values. The result is an important step towards being able to use MMS to verify solutions with discontinuities. This work also highlights the use of higher order numerical integration techniques for continuous and discontinuous solutions that are required for MMS on higher order finite volume codes.

The effect of plain-weaving on the mechanical properties of warp and weft p-phenylene terephthalamide (PPTA) fibers/yarns								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE				49	24			8272	8293		10.1007/s10853-014-8536-1			DEC 2014	2014	Coarse-grained molecular statics/dynamics methods are first used to investigate degradation in the PPTA fiber/yarn tensile strength, as a result of the prior compressive or tensile loading. PPTA fibers/yarns experience this type of loading in the course of a plain-weaving process, the process which is used in the fabrication of ballistic fabric and flexible armor. The more common all-atom molecular simulations were not used to assess strength degradation for two reasons: (a) the size of the associated computational domain rendering reasonable run-times would be too small and (b) modeling of the mechanical response of multi-fibril PPTA fibers could not be carried out (again due to the limited size of the computational domain). However, all-atom simulations were used to (a) define the coarse-grained particles (referred to as "beads") and (b) parameterize various components of the bead/bead force-field functions. In the second portion of the work, a simplified finite-element analysis of the plain-weaving process is carried out in order to assess the extent of tensile-strength degradation in warp and weft yarns during the weaving process. In this analysis, a new material model is used for the PPTA fibers/yarns. Specifically, PPTA is considered to be a linearly elastic, transversely isotropic material with degradable longitudinal-tensile strength and the longitudinal Young's modulus. Equations governing damage and strength/stiffness degradation in this material model are derived and parameterized using the coarse-grained simulation results. Lastly, the finite-element results are compared with their experimental counterparts, yielding a decent agreement.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0022-2461	1573-4803		WOS:000342453000007

This knowledge is valuable both for contextualizing user feature and function preferences and for characterizing and prioritizing design challenges and opportunities.METHODS: Fourteen hospital clinical and support staff subject-matter experts participated in semi-structured interviews with scenario enactments in a medium-fidelity, full-scale mock-up of a typical patient room. During these interviews, they interacted with two personas played by actors and were asked to enact an example of a normal visit, from entering the room through treatment/service and then exiting. Data were analyzed via methodological triangulation including frequency analysis, content analysis, and affinity diagramming.RESULTS: The results include a use-case analysis with illustrative sketches, a list of needs statements, and final observations.CONCLUSIONS: Successfully using the over-the-bed table is dependent upon proper positioning, especially in bed during meals. There are fewer problems associated with over-the-bed table use while seated in a chair than when in the bed. The over-the-bed table is a key component in acute care, inpatient therapies. Clinicians are generally open to "smart" furniture in the patient room but question its cost-effectiveness, robustness, and flexibility.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1937-5867	2167-5112		WOS:000340933200007	24554359

Corrosion resistant polymer derived ceramic composite environmental barrier coatings								JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN CERAMIC SOCIETY				34	15			3597	3606		10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2014.05.036			DEC 2014	2014	Corrosion resistant coatings are a promising solution to protect structural metals in harsh environments. Ceramic composite coatings made from polymer-derived ceramics are highly attractive due to the ease of their processing and the ability to work in various environments. This paper is focused on the performance of a TiSi2-filled SiOC ceramic composite coating system on 316 stainless steel (SS) substrates as a corrosion resistant coating. The best-performing quadruple-dip coatings were shown to be able to reduce the weight loss due to hot sulfuric acid (95+%, 104-107 degrees C) corrosion by 85% over a 30-day period. Coatings from the same system were also examined under 800 degrees C static (100 h) and cyclic (10 cycles) oxidation. Our results indicate that the coatings perform well under both conditions of prolonged high temperature oxidation and thermal cycling, suggesting the strong potential of this system as an environmental barrier coating (EBC).

J	Wang, Pei; Tao, Han; Wu, Fengfeng; Yang, Na; Chen, Feng; Jin, Zhengyu; Xu, Xueming								Effect of frozen storage on the foaming properties of wheat gliadin								FOOD CHEMISTRY				164				44	49		10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.05.010			DEC 1 2014	2014	In this study, the effect of frozen storage on the foaming properties of wheat gliadin was investigated and further elucidated by evaluating its physicochemical changes. The foaming volumes of gliadin solution decreased while the foaming stability increased during the frozen storage. This was directly attributed to decreased gliadin content and increased foam density and protein concentration involved in the foams. A more rigid conformation was observed when the frozen storage time increased: the alpha-helix structure increased at the cost of beta-sheet and unordered structure with the decreased surface hydrophobicity and increased surface tension of gliadin aqueous solutions. The percentage of gamma-gliadin within gliadin foams gradually decreased, indicating that gamma-gliadin was the most sensitive to freezing and the main contributor to the weakened foaming properties during the frozen storage. This study extended the knowledge of gliadin deterioration upon frozen storage and might contribute to the better understanding of frozen dough quality loss. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Two new test methods are also developed. The two methods characterize film-forming ability in two conditions. The first method characterizes the ability of a cement paste to form a stable film on a smooth nonabsorbent vertical surface. The paste thickness measured from this test is called, Ideal Paste Thickness (IPT). The second test characterizes the ability of cement paste to adhere and remain on an aggregate surface; this paste thickness is called Actual Paste Thickness (APT). The IPT can be used as a standardized parameter to evaluate the film-forming ability of cement pastes. The APT can be used to study the formation of cement paste films on pervious concrete aggregates. In this study IPT and APT of sixteen superplasticized cement pastes were evaluated. The pastes were prepared from four water to cement (w/c) ratios (0.23, 0.27, 0.32 and 0.37). (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The PPS included PrEP for all MSM, only high-risk MSM, high-risk heterosexuals, and IDUs, and all combinations of these four strategies. Outcomes included HIV infections averted, and incremental cost-effectiveness (per-infection averted) ratios. Initial assumptions regarding PrEP included a 44% reduction in HIV transmission, 50% uptake in the prioritized population and an annual cost per person of $9762. Sensitivity analyses on key parameters were conducted.Results: Prioritization to all MSM results in a 19% reduction in new HIV infections. Compared with PrEP for all persons at-risk, this PPS retains 79% of the preventive effect at 15% of the total cost. PrEP prioritized to only high-risk MSM results in a reduction in new HIV infections of 15%. This PPS retains 60% of the preventive effect at 6% of the total cost. There are diminishing returns when PrEP utilization is expanded beyond this group.Conclusion: PrEP implementation is relatively cost-inefficient under our initial assumptions. Our results suggest that PrEP should first be promoted among MSM who are at particularly high risk of HIV acquisition. Further expansion beyond this group may be cost-effective, but is unlikely to be cost-saving.

Since many delivery systems of VEGF have been reported, the presentation of VEGF using a more physiologically relevant extracellular matrix (ECM), however, has yet to be thoroughly examined. In this study, we propose that fibroblast-derived extracellular matrix (FDM) is a novel platform for angiogenic growth factor delivery and that FDM-mediated VEGF delivery can result in an advanced angiogenic response. The FDMs, activated by EDC/NHS chemistry, were loaded with varying amounts of heparin. Different doses of VEGF were subsequently immobilized onto the heparin-grafted FDM (hep-FDM); 19.6 +/- 0.6, 39.2 +/- 3.2, and 54.8 +/- 8.9 ng of VEGF were tethered using 100, 300, and 500 ng of initial VEGF, respectively. VEGF-tethered FDM was found chemoattractive and VEGF dose-dependent in triggering human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECs) migration in vitro. When hep-FDM-bound VEGF (H-F/V) was encapsulated into alginate capsules (A/H-F/V) and subjected to release test for 28 days, it exhibited a significantly reduced burst release at early time point compared to that of A/V. The cell proliferation results indicated a substantially extended temporal effect of A/H-F/V on EC proliferation compared to those treated with soluble VEGF. For a further study, A/H-F/V was transplanted subcutaneously into ICR mice for up to 4 weeks to assess its in vivo effect on angiogenesis; VEGF delivered by hep-FDM was more competitive in promoting blood vessel ingrowth and maturation compared to other groups. Taken together, this study successfully engineered an FDM-mediated VEGF delivery system, documented its capacity to convey VEGF in a sustained manner, and demonstrated the positive effects of angiogenic activity in vivo as well as in vitro.

Rietveld refinement and elemental analyses were used to identify the structure and stoichiometry of the compositions. The thermal conductivity was investigated by employing the Debye model with different phonon-scattering parameters. This investigation demonstrates that Fe substitution is feasible in these skutterudite derivatives and can significantly affect the transport properties as compared with Co4Ge6Se6.

Cerebrospinal Fluid Extracellular Vesicles Undergo Age Dependent Declines and Contain Known and Novel Non-coding RNAs								PLOS ONE				9	11					e113116	10.1371/journal.pone.0113116			NOV 24 2014	2014	Brain development requires precise orchestration of cellular events through the coordinate exchange of information between distally located cells. One mechanism by which intercellular communication is achieved is through the transfer of extracellular vesicles (EVs). Exosomes are EVs that carry lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins and are detectable in most biological fluids including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Here we report that CSF EV concentrations undergo age dependent fluctuations. We characterized EV RNA content by next generation small RNA sequencing and miRNA microarray analysis and identified a temporal shift in CSF EV content. CSF EVs encapsulated miRNAs that contain a conserved hnRNPA2/B1 recognition sequence. We found that hnRNPA2/B1-containing EVs were produced by choroid plexus epithelial cells and that hnRNPA2/B1 containing EVs decreased with age. These results provide insight into EV exchange of miRNAs within the central nervous system and a framework to understand how changes in EVs may have an important impact on brain development.									13	0	0	12	0	13			1932-6203			WOS:000346766900019	25420022

In this work, RuII flavonolato compounds, [Ru(eta(6)-p-cymene)(L)(3-Hfl)]OTf (<bold>8</bold>; 3-Hfl = monoanion of 3-hydroxyflavone; L = solvent) and [Ru(eta(6)-p-cymene)Cl(3-Hfl-X)] (<bold>3a3c</bold>; 3-Hfl-X = p-H, -Cl, or -F on the flavonolato phenyl substituent), have been evaluated for photoinduced reactivity within the flavonolato unit upon irradiation with UV (300 nm) or visible (419 nm) light under aerobic conditions. For each compound, irradiation in CH3CN was found to result in the loss of the p-cymene ligand and the formation of products resulting from oxidative ring opening of the flavonolato ligand in a dioxygenase-type reaction. This reaction also results in the release of carbon monoxide. The Ru-II products generated in these reactions are [RuII(solvent)(carboxylato)]+ and [Ru(CO)(solvent)(carboxylato)]+ (carboxylato = O-benzoylsalicylato or benzoato) species, as determined by ESI-MS. The amount of free CO generated depends on the wavelength of irradiation, with 300 nm light giving a higher amount of free CO. Evaluation of the photoinduced reactivity of <bold>8</bold> in DMSO/H2O (10:90) at 300 nm showed similar reactivity to that found in organic solvent, although the reaction occurs more slowly. The products of the photoreactions of <bold>8</bold> and <bold>3a</bold> at 419 nm are nontoxic toward human T-lymphocyte (Jurkat) and non-small-cell lung carcinoma (A549) cells. This lack of toxicity versus the starting compounds is likely due to differences in interactions of the [Ru-II(solvent)(carboxylato)]+ and [RuII(CO)(solvent)(carboxylato)]+ species with biomolecules (e.g., serum proteins), thus resulting in reduced bioavailabilty. 1H NMR studies provide evidence that the photoreaction products coordinate to biologically relevant donors such as histidine and 5'-GMP in d(6)-DMSO/D2O (10:90) and exhibit reactivity with these small molecules that is distinctly different from that exhibited by the starting compounds. Overall, the photoreactivity of <bold>8</bold> and <bold>3a3c</bold> may represent an approach toward altering the biological chemistry of these compounds.									6	0	0	1	0	6			0276-7333	1520-6041		WOS:000345552500012

In these copper-mediated allylic substitution reactions, the Z-isomer 4a displayed complete regio- and stereoselectivity (i.e., E:Z), while the regio- and stereoselectivity for E-isomer 17 varied as a function of solvent, cuprate reagent, transferable ligand, and cuprate counterion (e.g., Li+ vs MgX+). Excellent selectivities could be achieved with 17 and nBuCuCNLi in Et2O. Conditions for improved selectivities in the reactions of allylic cyanophosphates over those previously reported were found. A series of relative rate and competition experiments was performed, and the degree of regio- and stereoselectivity for each system was rationalized in the light of the current mechanistic understanding of cuprate-mediated allylic substitution reactions.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0022-3263			WOS:000345470900041	25303237

Using the survey data collected electronically from 148 mass customisation manufacturers in the USA, moderated hierarchical multiple regression was employed to test the research hypotheses. Results suggest that operational performance significantly increases when a bundle of complementary basic HRM practices are integrated in MCM contexts that emphasise module and process standardisation. This finding indicates that these types of mass customisation manufacturers are capitalising on the opportunity to improve operational performance by strategically combining several different, but supportive, traditional HRM practices with a finite MCM system.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0953-7287	1366-5871		WOS:000343662200001

A radiogenic heating evolution model for cosmochemically Earth-like exoplanets								ICARUS				243				274	286		10.1016/j.icarus.2014.08.031			NOV 15 2014	2014	Discoveries of rocky worlds around other stars have inspired diverse geophysical models of their plausible structures and tectonic regimes. Severe limitations of observable properties require many inexact assumptions about key geophysical characteristics of these planets. We present the output of an analytical galactic chemical evolution (GCE) model that quantitatively constrains one of those key properties: radiogenic heating. Earth's radiogenic heat generation has evolved since its formation, and the same will apply to exoplanets. We have fit simulations of the chemical evolution of the interstellar medium in the solar annulus to the chemistry of our Solar System at the time of its formation and then applied the carbonaceous chondrite/Earth's mantle ratio to determine the chemical composition of what we term "cosmochemically Earth-like" exoplanets. Through this approach, predictions of exoplanet radiogenic heat productions as a function of age have been derived. The results show that the later a planet forms in galactic history, the less radiogenic heat it begins with; however, due to radioactive decay, today, old planets have lower heat outputs per unit mass than newly formed worlds. The long half-life of Th-232 allows it to continue providing a small amount of heat in even the most ancient planets, while K-40 dominates heating in young worlds. Through constraining the age-dependent heat production in exoplanets, we can infer that younger, hotter rocky planets are more likely to be geologically active and therefore able to sustain the crustal recycling (e.g. plate tectonics) that may be a requirement for long-term biosphere habitability. In the search for Earth-like planets, the focus should be made on stars within a billion years or so of the Sun's age. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

We annotated the Daphnia magna NRs and compared them to Daphnia pulex and other species, primarily through phylogenetic analysis. Daphnia species contain 26 NRs spanning all seven gene subfamilies. Thirteen of the 26 receptors found in Daphnia species phylogenetically segregate into the NR1 subfamily, primarily involved in energy metabolism and resource allocation. Some of the Daphnia NRs, such as RXR, HR96, and E75 show strong conservation between D. magna and D. pulex. Other receptors, such as EcRb, THRL-11 and RARL-10 have diverged considerably and therefore may show different functions in the two species. Curiously, there is an inverse association between the number of NR splice variants and conservation of the LBD. Overall, D. pulex and D. magna possess the same NRs; however not all of the NRs demonstrate high conservation indicating the potential for a divergence of function. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Some varieties of sorghum, a staple cereal crop grown worldwide, have high concentrations of proanthocyanidins and 3-deoxyanthocyanidins, polyphenols with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. We quantified total phenols, proanthocyanidins, and 3-deoxyanthocyanidins in a global sorghum diversity panel (n = 381) using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and characterized the patterns of variation with respect to geographic origin and botanical race. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) with 404,628 SNP markers identified novel quantitative trait loci for sorghum polyphenols, some of which colocalized with homologues of flavonoid pathway genes from other plants, including an orthologue of maize (Zea mays) Pr1 and a homologue of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) TT16. This survey of grain polyphenol variation in sorghum germplasm and catalog of flavonoid pathway loci may be useful to guide future enhancement of cereal polyphenols.									11	2	0	9	0	13			0021-8561	1520-5118		WOS:000344906500009	25272193	
J	Zinzow, Heidi M; Thompson, Martie								Factors associated with use of verbally coercive, incapacitated, and forcible sexual assault tactics in a longitudinal study of college men.								Aggressive behavior											10.1002/AB.21567			2014-Nov-12	2014	Although verbally coerced and incapacitated sexual assaults are common, less is known about perpetrators of these incidents in comparison to perpetrators of forcible assaults. Furthermore, few studies have investigated factors that differentiate perpetrators who employ different forms of sexual assault tactics. The current study included 526 men who completed self-report inventories at the end of each of their four years in college. Measures assessed sexual assault tactics, demographics, incident characteristics, risky behavior, rape supportive beliefs and peer norms, antisocial traits, and childhood adversity. Perpetrators were grouped based on the most severe tactics reported over the course of 7 assessed time periods, with 13% in the verbal coercion group, 16% in the incapacitation group, and 5% in the forcible group. ANOVAs determined that the forcible group scored significantly higher than incapacitation and verbal coercion groups on risky behavior, rape supportive beliefs/norms, antisocial traits, and childhood adversity. The incapacitation group scored higher than the verbal coercion group on risky behavior. In a multinomial logistic regression analysis comparing tactic groups to non-perpetrators, all tactic groups scored significantly higher on risky behavior and rape supportive beliefs/norms, and the forcible group scored higher on antisocial traits and childhood adversity. Perpetrators in the forcible group had engaged in more repeat offenses, and perpetrators of both the incapacitated and forcible assaults were more likely to use alcohol before the incident. Findings highlight the need for interventions that are tailored to offense trajectories, alter rape supportive attitudes and peer norms, and decrease campus substance use. Aggr.

This source was detected during a very high gamma-ray activity state in 2012 March by the Large Area Telescope on board Fermi, becoming the gamma-ray flaring blazar at the highest redshift detected so far. At the peak of the flare the source reached an apparent isotropic gamma-ray luminosity of 6.6 x 10(49) erg s(-1) which is comparable to the values achieved by the most luminous blazars. This activity triggered radio-to-X-rays monitoring observations by Swift, Very Long Baseline Array, European VLBI Network, and Medicina single-dish telescope. Significant variability was observed from radio to X-rays supporting the identification of the gamma-ray source with TXS 0536+145. Both the radio and gamma-ray light curves show a similar behaviour, with the gamma-rays leading the radio variability with a time lag of about 4-6 months. The luminosity increase is associated with a flattening of the radio spectrum. No new superluminal component associated with the flare was detected in high-resolution parsec-scale radio images. During the flare the gamma-ray spectrum seems to deviate from a power law, showing a curvature that was not present during the average activity state. The gamma-ray properties of TXS 0536+145 are consistent with those shown by the high-redshift gamma-ray blazar population.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0035-8711	1365-2966		WOS:000343400100004		
J	Colin, Samuel; Valentini, Antony								Instability of quantum equilibrium in Bohm's dynamics								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES				470	2171					20140288	10.1098/rspa.2014.0288			NOV 8 2014	2014	We consider Bohm's second-order dynamics for arbitrary initial conditions in phase space. In principle, Bohm's dynamics allows for 'extended' non-equilibrium, with initial momenta not equal to the gradient of phase of the wave function (as well as initial positions whose distribution departs from the Born rule). We show that extended non-equilibrium does not relax in general and is in fact unstable. This is in sharp contrast with de Broglie's first-order dynamics, for which non-standard momenta are not allowed and which shows an efficient relaxation to the Born rule for positions. On this basis, we argue that, while de Broglie's dynamics is a tenable physical theory, Bohm's dynamics is not. In a world governed by Bohm's dynamics, there would be no reason to expect to see an effective quantum theory today (even approximately), in contradiction with observation.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1364-5021	1471-2946		WOS:000341809900004	25383020	
J	Seo, Kangjun; Tewari, Sumanta								Fermi-surface reconstruction and transport coefficients from a mean-field bidirectional charge-density wave state in the high-T-c cuprates								PHYSICAL REVIEW B				90	17					174503	10.1103/PhysRevB.90.174503			NOV 7 2014	2014	The recent discovery of an incipient charge-density wave (CDW) instability competing with superconductivity in a class of high-temperature cuprate superconductors has brought the role of charge order in the phase diagram of the cuprates under renewed focus. Here, we take a mean field Q(1) = (2 pi/3,0) and Q(2) = (0,2 pi/3) biaxial CDW state and calculate the Fermi-surface topology and the resulting Hall and Seebeck coefficients as a function of temperature and hole doping. We establish that, in the appropriate doping ranges where the low-temperature state (in the absence of superconductivity) is a CDW, the Fermi surface consists of electron pockets, resulting in the Hall and Seebeck coefficients becoming negative at low temperatures, as seen in experiments.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1098-0121	1550-235X		WOS:000345244300003

G-Bean: an ontology-graph based web tool for biomedical literature retrieval								BMC BIOINFORMATICS				15						S1	10.1186/1471-2105-15-S12-S1		12	NOV 6 2014	2014	Background: Currently, most people use NCBI's PubMed to search the MEDLINE database, an important bibliographical information source for life science and biomedical information. However, PubMed has some drawbacks that make it difficult to find relevant publications pertaining to users' individual intentions, especially for non-expert users. To ameliorate the disadvantages of PubMed, we developed G-Bean, a graph based biomedical search engine, to search biomedical articles in MEDLINE database more efficiently.Methods: G-Bean addresses PubMed's limitations with three innovations: (1) Parallel document index creation: a multithreaded index creation strategy is employed to generate the document index for G-Bean in parallel; (2) Ontology-graph based query expansion: an ontology graph is constructed by merging four major UMLS (Version 2013AA) vocabularies, MeSH, SNOMEDCT, CSP and AOD, to cover all concepts in National Library of Medicine (NLM) database; a Personalized PageRank algorithm is used to compute concept relevance in this ontology graph and the Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) weighting scheme is used to re-rank the concepts. The top 500 ranked concepts are selected for expanding the initial query to retrieve more accurate and relevant information; (3) Retrieval and re-ranking of documents based on user's search intention: after the user selects any article from the existing search results, G-Bean analyzes user's selections to determine his/her true search intention and then uses more relevant and more specific terms to retrieve additional related articles. The new articles are presented to the user in the order of their relevance to the already selected articles.Results: Performance evaluation with 106 OHSUMED benchmark queries shows that G-Bean returns more relevant results than PubMed does when using these queries to search the MEDLINE database. PubMed could not even return any search result for some OHSUMED queries because it failed to form the appropriate Boolean query statement automatically from the natural language query strings. G-Bean is available at http://bioinformatics. clemson.edu/G-Bean/index.php.Conclusions: G-Bean addresses PubMed's limitations with ontology-graph based query expansion, automatic document indexing, and user search intention discovery. It shows significant advantages in finding relevant articles from the MEDLINE database to meet the information need of the user.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1471-2105			WOS:000345685000001	25474588	
J	Wang, Xiaoli; Groff, Louis C.; McNeill, Jason D.								Multiple Energy Transfer Dynamics in Blended Conjugated Polymer Nanoparticles								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C				118	44			25731	25739		10.1021/jp508147r			NOV 6 2014	2014	Energy transfer dynamics in blended conjugated polymer nanoparticles (CPNs) were investigated in order to further our understanding of photoswitching and anomalous saturation behavior we previously observed, and as a way to probe the complex energy transport processes occurring in similar systems of interest such as nanostructured bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices. We prepared blended poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-co-(1,4-benzo-{2,1',3}-thiadiazole)] (PFBT)/poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MEH-PPV) nanoparticles with varying blending ratios. Efficient energy transfer from PFBT to MEH-PPV was observed, yielding bright, red-shifted emission. The donor exhibited complex decay kinetics consistent with energy transfer in complex, nanoscale, multichromophoric systems. The fluorescence decay kinetics and steady-state quenching efficiencies are compared to a multiple energy transfer model and prior results for dye-doped nanoparticles. The analysis indicates that the high energy transfer efficiency is largely due to multistep energy transfer (i.e., exciton diffusion), while the lifetime heterogeneity appears to be strongly influenced by acceptor polymer polydispersity as well as nanoscale inhomogeneity. The emerging picture could inform efforts to optimize CPNs for advanced imaging applications, and to optimize energy transport in bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1932-7447			WOS:000344579300048

A Novel Gain-Of-Function Mutation of the Proneural IRX1 and IRX2 Genes Disrupts Axis Elongation in the Araucana Rumpless Chicken								PLOS ONE				9	11					e112364	10.1371/journal.pone.0112364			NOV 5 2014	2014	Axis elongation of the vertebrate embryo involves the generation of cell lineages from posterior progenitor populations. We investigated the molecular mechanism governing axis elongation in vertebrates using the Araucana rumpless chicken. Araucana embryos exhibit a defect in axis elongation, failing to form the terminal somites and concomitant free caudal vertebrae, pygostyle, and associated tissues of the tail. Through whole genome sequencing of six Araucana we have identified a critical 130 kb region, containing two candidate causative SNPs. Both SNPs are proximal to the IRX1 and IRX2 genes, which are required for neural specification. We show that IRX1 and IRX2 are both misexpressed within the bipotential chordoneural hinge progenitor population of Araucana embryos. Expression analysis of BRA and TBX6, required for specification of mesoderm, shows that both are downregulated, whereas SOX2, required for neural patterning, is expressed in ectopic epithelial tissue. Finally, we show downregulation of genes required for the protection and maintenance of the tailbud progenitor population from the effects of retinoic acid. Our results support a model where the disruption in balance of mesoderm and neural fate results in early depletion of the progenitor population as excess neural tissue forms at the expense of mesoderm, leading to too few mesoderm cells to form the terminal somites. Together this cascade of events leads to axis truncation.									4	0	0	4	0	4			1932-6203			WOS:000344556900138	25372603	
J	Petukh, Marharyta; Wu, Bohua; Stefl, Shannon; Smith, Nick; Hyde-Volpe, David; Wang, Li; Alexov, Emil								Chronic Beryllium Disease: Revealing the Role of Beryllium Ion and Small Peptides Binding to HLA-DP2								PLOS ONE				9	11					e111604	10.1371/journal.pone.0111604			NOV 4 2014	2014	Chronic Beryllium (Be) Disease (CBD) is a granulomatous disorder that predominantly affects the lung. The CBD is caused by Be exposure of individuals carrying the HLA-DP2 protein of the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII). While the involvement of Be in the development of CBD is obvious and the binding site and the sequence of Be and peptide binding were recently experimentally revealed [1], the interplay between induced conformational changes and the changes of the peptide binding affinity in presence of Be were not investigated. Here we carry out in silico modeling and predict the Be binding to be within the acidic pocket (Glu26, Glu68 and Glu69) present on the HLA-DP2 protein in accordance with the experimental work [1]. In addition, the modeling indicates that the Be ion binds to the HLA-DP2 before the corresponding peptide is able to bind to it. Further analysis of the MD generated trajectories reveals that in the presence of the Be ion in the binding pocket of HLA-DP2, all the different types of peptides induce very similar conformational changes, but their binding affinities are quite different. Since these conformational changes are distinctly different from the changes caused by peptides normally found in the cell in the absence of Be, it can be speculated that CBD can be caused by any peptide in presence of Be ion. However, the affinities of peptides for Be loaded HLA-DP2 were found to depend of their amino acid composition and the peptides carrying acidic group at positions 4 and 7 are among the strongest binders. Thus, it is proposed that CBD is caused by the exposure of Be of an individual carrying the HLA-DP2*0201 allele and that the binding of Be to HLA-DP2 protein alters the conformational and ionization properties of HLA-DP2 such that the binding of a peptide triggers a wrong signaling cascade.									5	0	0	2	0	5			1932-6203			WOS:000344402000075	25369028

HMX was found to be exceptionally selective for quantitative detection of higher-order and tertiary interactions. When incorporated as experimental constraints in discrete molecular dynamics simulations, HMX information yielded accurate three-dimensional models, emphasizing the power of molecular interference to guide RNA tertiary structure analysis and fold refinement. In the case of a large, multidomain RNA, the Tetrahymena group I intron, HMX identified multiple distinct sets of tertiary structure interaction groups in a single, concise experiment.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0006-2960			WOS:000344510300013	25341083

It is therefore imperative to mitigate cationic charge-induced toxicity and understand the effects of such changes. Presented here is a synergistic experimental and computational approach to examine the effects of varying terminal surface charge on the capacity of dendrimers to disperse model liner, polycyclic aromatic, and hybrid hydrocarbons. Uncharged dendrimers collapse by forming intramolecular hydrogen bonds, which reduce the hosting capability. On the other hand, changing the surface charges from positive to negative greatly shifts the pK(a) of tertiary amines of the PAMAM dendrimer interior. As a result, the negatively charged dendrimers have a significant percentage of tertiary amines protonated similar to 30%. This unexpected change in the interior protonation state causes electrostatic interactions with the anionic terminal groups, leading to contraction and a marked decrease in hydrocarbon hosting capacity. The present work highlights the robust nature of dendrimer oil dispersion and also illuminates potentially unintended or unanticipated effects of varying dendrimer surface chemistry on their encapsulation or hosting efficacy, which is important for their environmental, industrial, and biomedical applications.									14	0	0	6	0	14			0013-936X	1520-5851		WOS:000344449100047	25279688

Cell suspensions of BG01V/hOG and H9 hESC lines were pipetted into non-adherent hydrogel substrates containing defined microwell arrays. hEBs of consistent size and spherical geometry can be formed in each of the four conditions, including the -ROCKi/-spin condition. The hEBs formed under the -ROCKi/-spin condition differentiated to develop the three embryonic germ layers and tissues derived from each of the germ layers. This simplified hEB production technique offers homogeneity in hEB size and shape to support synchronous differentiation, elimination of the ROCKi xeno-factor and rate-limiting centrifugation treatment, and low-cost scalability, which will directly support automated, large-scale production of hEBs and hESC-derived cells needed for clinical, research, or therapeutic applications.									4	0	0	3	0	4			1932-6203			WOS:000345558100001	25365581

Self-Repairable Polyurethane Networks by Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide and Water								ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION				53	45			12142	12147		10.1002/anie.201407978			NOV 3 2014	2014	Sugar moieties were incorporated into cross-linked polyurethane (PUR) networks in an effort to achieve self-repairing in the presence of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). When methyl-alpha-D-glucopyranoside (MGP) molecules are reacted with hexamethylene diisocyanate trimer (HDI) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) to form cross-linked MGP-polyurethane (PUR) networks, these materials are capable of self-repairing in air. This process requires atmospheric amounts of CO2 and H2O, thus resembling plant behavior of carbon fixation during the photosynthesis cycle. Molecular processes responsible for this unique self-repair process involve physical diffusion of cleaved network segments as well as the formation of carbonate and urethane linkages. Unlike plants, MGP-PUR networks require no photo-initiated reactions, and they are thus capable of repair in darkness under atmospheric conditions.									6	0	0	2	0	6			1433-7851	1521-3773		WOS:000344052000024	25220903

Human Dimensions of Wildlife				19	6			498	511					Nov 2 2014	2014	Soundscapes have become recognized as an important natural resource. The traditional human-made versus natural soundscape comparison currently used in recreational resource management is challenged by borrowing soundscape components (i.e., biophony, anthrophony, geophony) from soundscape ecology. This article evaluated the soundscape preference of birders. A three-component model of recreational specialization was used to evaluate how recreationists differ in their preference for soundscape components. Data from in-person surveys collected at The Audubon Center and Sanctuary at Francis Beidler Forest in Harleyville, South Carolina were used in combination with surveys from online birding list servers to obtain a sample of 415 individuals with varying levels of specialization. The findings suggest soundscape preference exists as biophony, geophony, and anthrophony and that more specialized birders found geophony to be significantly more annoying than less specialized birders. Additionally, the skill and knowledge component of specialization best explained the difference in geophony preference among birders.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1087-1209			ZOOREC:ZOOR15102010411

We analyse two leagues with differing fan types: one 'hostile' league (Germany's Bundesliga) and one league perceived as 'peaceful' (America's Major League Soccer). Although there is a strong home-field bias inherent in football, we find evidence that part of the bias is due to the prospect of fan violence.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1350-4851	1466-4291		WOS:000344527400013

Evaluation of the Clemson instrumented subsoiler shank in coastal plain soils								COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE				109				46	51		10.1016/j.compag.2014.09.002			NOV 2014	2014	Most sandy soils in coastal plains of the southeastern USA have a compacted zone or hardpan which limits root penetration below the plowing depth, reducing yields, and predisposing plants to drought stress. The hardpan layer exhibits a great amount of variability in depth and thickness in this region. Real-time, sensor-based, site-specific tillage could achieve significant savings in energy requirements for subsoiling and increase crop yields. Replicated tests were conducted to evaluate the performance of the Clemson instrumented subsoiler shank under actual field conditions. The instrumented subsoiler shank was calibrated against cone penetrometer readings on three coastal plain soil types. A strong positive correlation between soil strength values measured with the penetrometer and the instrumented subsoiler shank was observed (R-2 = 0.89-0.97). On average, the shank index values (measured horizontally) were about 50% less than the corresponding cone index values (measured vertically). The effect of soil moisture content on shank-penetrometer correlation was not significant (alpha = 0.05). It is possible to determine the depth and thickness of the hardpan layers with the instrumented subsoiler shank either for real time control of subsoiling location and depth or for generating site-specific tillage maps.

Wind-Turbine Gear-Box Roller-Bearing Premature-Failure Caused by Grain-Boundary Hydrogen Embrittlement: A Multi-physics Computational Investigation								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				23	11			3984	4001		10.1007/s11665-014-1188-0			NOV 2014	2014	To help overcome the problem of horizontal-axis wind-turbine (HAWT) gear-box roller-bearing premature-failure, the root causes of this failure are currently being investigated using mainly laboratory and field-test experimental approaches. In the present work, an attempt is made to develop complementary computational methods and tools which can provide additional insight into the problem at hand (and do so with a substantially shorter turn-around time). Toward that end, a multi-physics computational framework has been developed which combines: (a) quantum-mechanical calculations of the grain-boundary hydrogen-embrittlement phenomenon and hydrogen bulk/grain-boundary diffusion (the two phenomena currently believed to be the main contributors to the roller-bearing premature-failure); (b) atomic-scale kinetic Monte Carlo-based calculations of the hydrogen-induced embrittling effect ahead of the advancing crack-tip; and (c) a finite-element analysis of the damage progression in, and the final failure of a prototypical HAWT gear-box roller-bearing inner raceway. Within this approach, the key quantities which must be calculated using each computational methodology are identified, as well as the quantities which must be exchanged between different computational analyses. The work demonstrates that the application of the present multi-physics computational framework enables prediction of the expected life of the most failure-prone HAWT gear-box bearing elements.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1059-9495	1544-1024		WOS:000344331200020

Effects of commercial in ovo injection of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol on bone development and mineralization in male and female broilers								POULTRY SCIENCE				93	11			2734	2739		10.3382/ps.2014-03981			NOV 2014	2014	Improved bone development and mineralization in broilers have been attributed to the use of 25-hydroxylcholecalceiferol [25(OH)D-3] as a dietary supplement. In this study, effects of the in ovo injection of 25(OH)D-3 delivered in commercial diluent on 18 d of incubation (doi) on subsequent bone development and mineralization in male and female Ross x Ross 708 broilers were investigated. The variables investigated included bone mineral density and breaking strength, bone ash concentration, and calcium and phosphorus bone ash concentrations. In a single-stage incubator, with 6 treatments on each of the 10 tray levels, a total of 2,400 experimental broiler hatching eggs were evenly and randomly set. Eggs were treatment-injected and transferred to corresponding hatching baskets on 18 doi. Experimental treatment groups were those that received 0.2, 0.6, 1.8, or 5.4 mu g of 25(OH)D-3 that were delivered in 100 mu L of commercial diluent. Noninjected and diluent-injected controls were also included. on 21 doi, chicks were pulled and placed in corresponding floor pens, and on each of d 0, 14, and 28 posthatch (poh), 2 birds of each sex from each pen were randomly selected for necropsy and extraction of both of their tibia bones. Bones from the right leg were subjected to mineral density analysis and those from the left leg were used to determine breaking strength and residual bone ash concentration. Furthermore, ash calcium and phosphorus concentrations on d 14 and 28 poh were determined. There was a treatment x sex x age interaction for bone breaking strength. Bone breaking strength in male birds on d 28 poh was higher in the 0.20, 0.60, and 1.80 mu g of 25(OH)D-3-injected treatment groups than in the diluent-injected control group. In conclusion, although the in ovo injection of 25(OH)D-3 had no positive effect on the bone development of Ross x Ross 708 broilers through d 28 poh compared with noninjected controls, it may provide a benefit to those subjected to an injection of commercial vaccine diluent.									2	1	0	2	0	3			0032-5791	1525-3171		WOS:000344878000006	25193259

Liquid crystallinity in trimer oligomers isolated from petroleum and pyrene pitches								CARBON				79				265	273		10.1016/j.carbon.2014.07.067			NOV 2014	2014	The first unsubstituted, monodisperse polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) to form a liquid crystalline phase (100% mesophase) has been isolated. With a molecular weight of 598 Da and consisting of only 14 aromatic rings, this pyrene trimer is also the lowest molecular weight (mol wt) PAH species for which the existence of liquid crystallinity has been reported. Multiple isomers of the pyrene trimer exist, providing the melting-point depression (mpt = 290 degrees C) necessary for the existence of a liquid phase and the possibility of mesophase formation. The trimer cut of M-50 pitch (mol wt = 645-890 Da; mpt = 330 degrees C) has also been isolated and was found to consist of similar to 40% mesophase. This trimer is the lowest average mol wt carbonaceous pitch for which significant mesophase formation has been reported. Both trimers were isolated from their starting pitches via packed-column supercritical extraction, using toluene and N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) mixtures as the extractive solvent. Mass spectrometry and UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy were used for molecular characterization. The results of this study indicate that for PAHs, the molecular weight for which liquid crystallinity occurs can be significantly reduced by creating PAH oligomers with lower polydispersity and increased monomer-unit homogeneity.

This study sought to improve the persuasive writing skills and self-efficacy skills of students with emotional and behavioral disorders by implementing self-regulated strategy development with pairs of students in a high school health class. Using a multiple probe multiple baseline across pairs of participants design, a functional relation was demonstrated between the intervention and students' persuasive writing skills as measured by essay elements, quality, and correct word sequences. Data on motivation to write and self-efficacy for writing were mixed, suggesting that additional research is needed. Social validity data suggested the intervention was socially acceptable to all participants, improving postintervention.

Lessons Learned from Implementing Self-Regulated Strategy Development with Students with Emotional and Behavioral Disorders in Alternative Educational Settings								BEHAVIORAL DISORDERS				40	1			68	77					NOV 2014	2014	Self-regulated strategy development (SRSD) is an evidence-based intervention for use with students with emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD). To date, there are nine studies investigating SRSD in alternative education settings, including self-contained day and residential schools, with 113 students with EBD in grades 3 through 12. A brief synthesis of this body of SRSD research is presented, which represents SRSD implementation in individualized, small-group, and class-wide formats using group and single-case research design methodology. Lessons learned from this research are presented to inform both practitioners and researchers, including guidelines for overcoming the unique barriers to SRSD implementation that students with EBD in alternative education settings may present. Lessons learned include the need for (a) developing strategies for increasing students' academic engagement, (b) further addressing behavioral and academic needs, (c) overcoming issues of truancy and transience, (d) promoting maintenance and generalization, and (e) increasing teacher buy-in. Future directions for this line of research are also outlined.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0198-7429	2163-5307		WOS:000349233600006

Lipid Feeding and Milk Fat Depression								VETERINARY CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA-FOOD ANIMAL PRACTICE				30	3			623	+		10.1016/j.cvfa.2014.07.006			NOV 2014	2014	Diets fed to cattle contain mostly unsaturated fatty acids supplied in grains and forages, by-products, and fat supplements. Lipid intake by dairy cattle must be restricted to prevent alterations of microbial populations in the rumen that can negatively affect milk yield. Unsaturated fatty acids consumed by cattle are extensively metabolized through biohydrogenation, intermediates of which include conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and trans-monoenoic acid isomers. Three specific CLA intermediates of biohydrogenation have been shown to cause milk fat depression in dairy cattle through coordinated suppression of mammary lipogenic genes by a transcription factor that is a central regulator of lipid synthesis.									5	0	0	3	0	5			0749-0720	1558-4240		WOS:000344819900007	25239061

Alternative Acetate Production Pathways in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii during Dark Anoxia and the Dominant Role of Chloroplasts in Fermentative Acetate Production								PLANT CELL				26	11			4499	4518		10.1105/tpc.114.129965			NOV 2014	2014	Chlamydomonas reinhardtii insertion mutants disrupted for genes encoding acetate kinases (EC 2.7.2.1) (ACK1 and ACK2) and a phosphate acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.8) (PAT2, but not PAT1) were isolated to characterize fermentative acetate production. ACK1 and PAT2 were localized to chloroplasts, while ACK2 and PAT1 were shown to be in mitochondria. Characterization of the mutants showed that PAT2 and ACK1 activity in chloroplasts plays a dominant role (relative to ACK2 and PAT1 in mitochondria) in producing acetate under dark, anoxic conditions and, surprisingly, also suggested that Chlamydomonas has other pathways that generate acetate in the absence of ACK activity. We identified a number of proteins associated with alternative pathways for acetate production that are encoded on the Chlamydomonas genome. Furthermore, we observed that only modest alterations in the accumulation of fermentative products occurred in the ack1, ack2, and ack1 ack2 mutants, which contrasts with the substantial metabolite alterations described in strains devoid of other key fermentation enzymes.									10	0	0	8	0	10			1040-4651	1532-298X		WOS:000348645200017	25381350	
J	Smith, Kelly C.								Manifest complexity: A foundational ethic for astrobiology?								SPACE POLICY				30	4			209	214		10.1016/j.spacepol.2014.10.004			NOV 2014	2014	This paper examines the age old question of the basis of moral value in the new context of astrobiology, which offers a fresh perspective. The goal is to offer the broad outline of a general theory of moral value that can accommodate the diversity of living entities we are likely to encounter beyond the confines of Earth. It begins with ratiocentrism, the view that the possession of reason is the primary means by which we differentiate entities having moral value in and of themselves from those having moral value merely by virtue of the uses to which they can be put. I broaden this basis to include sociality and culture, arguing that these three attributes tend evolve as a "package deal." Because of this, it's really the sociality-reason-culture triad (SRCT) which should be the criterion for intrinsic moral value. If the SRCT linkage is sufficiently strong, it follows that this sort of moral valuation would be shared by any non-human entities capable of reflection on the nature of such things, granting it a curious kind of objectivity. I then suggest that the unfolding of complexity produced by siza species may be the best means to realize the manifest destiny (manifest complexity) of all life, which could provide an ultimate, metaphysical foundation for ethical value. Finally, I outline how this new theory can be applied to different types of entities that we may encounter beyond Earth. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Structural and biochemical studies suggest that GH binds GHR in a 1:2 stoichiometry to effect acute GHR conformational changes that trigger the activation of the receptor-associated tyrosine kinase, Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), and downstream signaling. Despite information about GHR-GHR association derived from elegant fluorescence resonance energy transfer/bioluminescence resonance energy transfer studies, an assessment of the dynamics of GH-induced GHR conformational changes has been lacking. To this end, we used a split luciferase complementation assay that allowed detection in living cells of specific ligand-independent GHR-GHR interaction. Furthermore, GH treatment acutely augmented complementation of enzyme activity between GHRs fused, respectively, to N- and C-terminal fragments of firefly luciferase. Analysis of the temporal pattern of GH-induced complementation changes, pharmacological manipulation, genetic alteration of JAK2 levels, and truncation of the GHR intracellular domain (ICD) tail suggested that GH acutely enhances proximity of the GHR homodimer partners independent of the presence of JAK2, phosphorylation of GHR-luciferase chimeras, or an intact ICD. However, subsequent reduction of complementation requires JAK2 kinase activity and the ICD tail. This conclusion is in contrast to existing models of the GHR activation process.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0888-8809			WOS:000346837100006	25188449

Fully mature, ("ready-to-eat" stage) firm fruit of peach cultivars China Pearl, Contender, and Carolina Gold were collected from established trees at two North Carolina locations in 2009 and 2010. Advanced breeding selections NC Yellow and NC 97-48 were collected from a single location in both years. Using tandem extractions and chromatography analyses, 10 carotenoids and 24 phenolic compounds were quantified separately in the peel and flesh. Statistically significant differences were noted among peach cultivars and advanced selections for beta-carotene, cyanidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-rutinoside, cholorogenic acid, quercetin-3-glucoside, and individual procyanidins. Peel anthocyanin (ANC) concentration ranged from 183 mg/100 g in 'Contender' to non-detectable levels in NC97-48 and NC Yellow. 'China Pearl' and 'Carolina Gold' produced ANC levels approximately half of 'Contender'. Chlorogenic acid concentration also fit a discrete pattern of accumulation but was not related to the accumulation of ANC. 'China Pearl', NC 97-48, and NC Yellow contained the highest levels of chlorogenic acid (105 to 136 mg/100 g), 'Carolina Gold' contained the lowest (52 mg/100 g), and 'Contender' represented an intermediate phenotype (70 mg/100 g). Statistically significant genetic variation was found for almost all compounds identified, whereas location and year effects tended to be compound-specific. For chlorogenic acid, 28% of the phenotypic variance was explained by location (year = nonsignificant), whereas 40% of the phenotypic variation of ANC was explained by differences in years (location = nonsignificant). Analyzing fruit from the same environment over 2 years or from two locations in the same year would not have adequately accounted for the variation associated with environment. The detailed phytochemical profile of peach reported here demonstrates the importance of multiyear, multilocation analysis in revealing accurate measures of phytochemical genetic variation and provides a comprehensive baseline analysis of phytochemicals in commonly grown peach cultivars that can be used to evaluate novel germplasm.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0003-1062	2327-9788		WOS:000346233800008

Three different thermal cycling profiles were used; each differentiated by their peak cycling temperature (100 degrees C, 150 degrees C, 200 degrees C) and the time needed to complete one cycle (cycle time). The study was performed on two Cu TSV wafer sample types; one containing large processing-induced voids (voided sample), the other without (non-voided sample). It was found that the RF signal return loss vertical bar S-11 vertical bar of the Cu TSVs increased upon thermal cycling for both the voided and the non-voided sample types. This was attributed to the increase in the void area due to the formation of new voids, rather than the growth of preexisting voids. On the other hand, the grain orientation and grain sizes of the Cu TSVs were found to be unaffected by all studied thermal cycling conditions and sample types. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The Origin of the Metal-Poor Common Proper Motion Pair HD 134439/134440: Insights from New Elemental Abundances								PUBLICATIONS OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF THE PACIFIC				126	945			1010	1026		10.1086/679290			NOV 2014	2014	The low [/Fe] ratio in the metal-poor ([Fe/H]approximate to-1.50) common proper motion pair HD 134439 and HD 134440 has been variously attributed to chemical evolution in an extragalactic environment with an irregular star formation history, planetesimal accretion, and formation in an environment with an unusually high dust-to-gas ratio. We explore these various putative origins using CNO, Be, Ag, and Eu abundances derived from high-resolution near-UV Keck/HIRES spectroscopy. While we confirm a previously suggested correlation between elemental abundance ratios and condensation temperature at the 95% confidence level, these ratios lie within the continuum of values manifested by extant dSph data. We argue that the most plausible origin of our stars' distinctive abundance distribution relative to the Galactic halo field is formation in an environment chemically dominated by products of Type II SN of low progenitor mass; such a progenitor mass bias has been previously suggested as an explanation of low -element ratios of dSph stars. The proper motion pair's heavy-to-light n-capture element ratio, which is 0.3-0.5dex lower than in the Galactic halo field and dSph stars, is discussed in the context of the truncated r-process, phenomenological n-capture production models, and -rich freezeout in a high neutron excess environment; the latter simultaneously provides an attractive explanation of the difference in [Ca, Ti/O, Mg, Si] ratio in HD 134439/134440 compared to in situ dSph stars.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0004-6280	1538-3873		WOS:000346238800002

However, this approach is problematic if the information is based on inaccurate perceptions. In light of this, the authors introduce a theoretical model to study the antecedents and profit impact of salesperson perceptions of customer relationship quality. Dyadic analyses using matched survey responses from salesperson-customer dyads and secondary performance data reveal several insightful findings. Results show that self-efficacious salespeople are upwardly biased, whereas customer-oriented salespeople are downwardly biased in their perceptions of customer relationship quality. However, managers can correct these inaccuracies using a behavior-based control system. Response surface analyses illustrate that the effects of salesperson accuracy and inaccuracy are distinct and curvilinear. During later relationship phases, salespeople profit more from salesperson accuracy in high-and low-quality relationships (i.e., a U-shaped effect). Yet the increasingly harmful impact of salesperson inaccuracy on profit is more severe during earlier relationship phases. Together, these findings highlight the benefits of measuring salesperson perceptions and how to manage them.									7	0	0	0	1	8			0022-2429	1547-7185		WOS:000346134700003

Considering the substantial costs in conducting experiments, it is of value to have an estimate of the amount of data required to infer the network structure. To minimize wasted resources, it is also beneficial to know which data are necessary to identify the network. Knowledge of the data and knowledge of the terms in polynomial models are often required a priori in model identification. In applications, it is unlikely that the structure of a polynomial model will be known, which may force data sets to be unnecessarily large in order to identify a model. Furthermore, none of the known results provides any strategy for constructing data sets to uniquely identify a model. We provide a specialization of an existing criterion for deciding when a set of data points identifies a minimal polynomial model when its monomial terms have been specified. Then, we relax the requirement of the knowledge of the monomials and present results for model identification given only the data. Finally, we present a method for constructing data sets that identify minimal polynomial models.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0092-8240	1522-9602		WOS:000345138900010	25280666

Its recent growth is attributable to the rise of both the sustainable foods movement and volunteer tourism. Focusing on the experience of farmers, results suggest that despite some caveats there are both social and economic benefits associated with this particular form of tourism, especially in dealing with labor shortages. It is suggested that the WWOOF model may be useful in other forms of volunteer tourism, but that its benefits are socially and spatially contingent, particularly in that WWOOF is embedded in a larger social movement that serves to create a force of willing laborers.

The calculated structural parameters at zero pressure are in consistent with experiments. Under pressure, elastic constants and their pressure dependence are obtained using the static finite strain technique. ZrAl2 exhibits lower elastic anisotropy. The linear thermal expansion coefficient shows greater effects of temperature at lower pressure. The ideal tensile have been investigated by stress-strain calculations. Finally, the microscopic mechanism that determines the structural stability is studied using the results of electronic structure calculations. We propose that the weakening of Zr-Zr leads to the significant change of stress-strain curve at strain similar to 0.27, and the breaking of Zr-2-Zr-3 leads to the structural instability of ZrAl2 under large tensile strains.

It has a variety of applications in many fields, but has proven itself extremely challenging to solve. As a result, an area of research has been to identify special cases which admit efficient solution strategies. This paper examines four such cases, and shows how each can be explained in terms of the dual region to the continuous relaxation of a classical linear reformulation of the problem known as the level-1 RLT representation. The explanations allow for simplifications and/or generalizations of the conditions defining the special cases. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Starting from allylic esters, which were prepared from fluorinated or fluorine free allylic alcohols by esterification with pentafluorosulfanylacetyl chloride, a range of trans-configured gamma,delta-unsaturated alpha-pentafluorosulfanyl carboxylic acids were synthesized via Ireland-Claisen rearrangements. The formation of intermediate (E)- and (Z)-enolates as the key-step was confirmed by NMR spectroscopy, which also indicated that only the (Z)-enolates rearrange, while the (E)-enolates are stable under the reaction conditions and hydrolyze back to the starting allylic esters during aqueous workup. As a consequence an incomplete rearrangement of the starting esters was observed. Transformation of the formed acids into the corresponding methyl esters allowed an easier isolation of the desired pentafluorosulfanyl-containing products. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Lean manufacturing and firm performance: The incremental contribution of lean management accounting practices								JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT				32	7-8	SI		414	428		10.1016/j.jom.2014.09.002			NOV 2014	2014	Manufacturing firms operating in rapidly changing and highly competitive markets have embraced the continuous process improvement mindset. They have worked to improve quality, flexibility, and customer response time using the principles of Lean thinking. To reach its potential, lean must be adopted as a holistic business strategy, rather than an activity isolated in operations. The lean enterprise calls for the integration of lean practices across operations and other business functions. As a critical component for achieving financial control, management accounting practices (MAP) need to be adjusted to meet the demands and objectives of lean organizations. Our aim is to help both researchers and practitioners better understand how lean MAP can support operations personnel with their internal decision making, and operations executives and business leaders in their objective of increasing lean operations performance as part of a holistic lean enterprise strategy. We use survey data from 244 U.S. manufacturing firms to construct a structural equation model. We document that the extent of lean manufacturing implementation is associated with the use of lean MAP, and further that the lean MAP are related in a systematic way: simplified and strategically aligned MAP positively influences the use of value stream costing, which in turn positively influences the use of visual performance measures. We also find that the extent of lean manufacturing practices is directly related to operations performance. More importantly, lean manufacturing practices also indirectly affect operations performance through lean MAP. These findings are consistent with the notion that lean thinking is a holistic business strategy. In order to derive the greatest impact on performance, our results indicate that operations management cannot operate in a vacuum. Instead, operations and accounting personnel must partner with each other to ensure that lean MAP are strategically integrated into the lean culture. In sum, lean MAP provide essential financial control that integrates with and supports operations to achieve desired benefits. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Based on Brenner's notions of spatial rescaling and spatial selectivity, this study assesses the changing distribution of domestic tourism in South Korea between 1989 and 2011, and relates these changes to the national tourism policies put in place during those years. Spatial statistical techniques including Moran's global I statistic and local indicators of spatial association are employed. Findings suggest that while domestic tourism activity became less concentrated at the macro level during the study period, at a finer scale it is clear that this deconcentration is nevertheless occurring in a clustered manner. Thus, while the traditional emphasis on Seoul and the southeast appears to have declined, the distribution of tourism's benefits is still uneven. Observations with regards to future tourism policy and concomitant spatial patterns of development and activity are provided.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0047-2875	1552-6763		WOS:000345588600010

The building block of such a membrane is examined, namely a single large pentablock co-polymer that consists of a center block of a randomly sulfonated polystyrene, designed for transport, tethered to poly-ethylene-r-propylene and end-capped by poly-t-butyl styrene, for mechanical stability, using molecular dynamics simulations. The polymer structure in a cyclohexane-heptane mixture, a technologically viable solvent, and in water, a poor solvent for all segments and a ubiquitous substance is extracted. In all solvents the pentablock collapsed into nearly spherical aggregates where the ionic block is segregated. In hydrophobic solvents, the ionic block resides in the center, surrounded by swollen intermix of flexible and end blocks. In water all blocks are collapsed with the sulfonated block residing on the surface. Our results demonstrate that solvents drive different local nano-segregation, providing a gateway to assemble membranes with controlled topology.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1022-1344	1521-3919		WOS:000345442500001

Helping Graduate Teaching Assistants in Biology Use Student Evaluations as Professional Development								AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER				76	9			584	588		10.1525/abt.2014.76.9.3			NOV-DEC 2014	2014	Graduate teaching assistants (GTAs) are often used as instructors in undergraduate introductory science courses, particularly in laboratory and discussion sections associated with large lectures. These GTAs are often novice teachers with little opportunity to develop their teaching skills through formal professional development. Focused self-reflection about end-of-semester teaching evaluations may be an important informal supplement to teacher training. To inform this practice, we explored the instructional behaviors that under-graduates perceived as most important for GTAs' teaching effectiveness in laboratory courses. In spring semester 2012, 1159 undergraduates in freshman-level biology lab courses rated their GTAs on 21 instructional behaviors, the GTAs' teaching effectiveness, the amount the student learned, and their expected grade in the laboratory. Using linear mixed models, we found that instructional behaviors related to the categories of teaching techniques and interpersonal rapport best predicted student ratings of GTAs' teaching effectiveness. GTAs or other novice teachers can use this information to identify specific areas for instructional improvement when considering student feedback about their teaching.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0002-7685	1938-4211		WOS:000344954900003

In order to better understand plasma processes (and different from previous reports), no form of collision/reaction processing was performed to remove molecular interferents. The evaluation was performed employing five test elements: cesium, silver, lead, lanthanum and nickel (10(-4) mol L-1 in 1 mol L-1 HNO3). The intensity of the atomic ions, levels of spectral background, the signal-to-background ratios, and the atomic-to-oxide/hydroxide adduct ratios were monitored in order to obtain fundamental understanding with regards to not only how each parameter effects the performance of this LS-APGD source, but also the inter-parametric effects. The results indicate that the discharge current and the liquid sampling flow rates are the key aspects that control the spectral composition. A compromise set of operating conditions was determined: sheath gas flow rate = 0.9 L min(-1), discharge current = 10 mA, solution flow rate = 10 mu L min(-1), and sampling distance = 1 cm. Limits of detection (LODs) were calculated using the SBR-RSDB (signal-to-background ratio/relative standard deviation of the background) approach under the optimized condition. The LODs for the test elementals ranged from 15 to 400 ng mL(-1) for 10 mu L injections, with absolute mass values from 0.2 to 4 ng.									8	0	0	5	0	8			1618-2642	1618-2650		WOS:000344860300009	25002336

Hsein								Gradient-based design robustness measure for robust geotechnical design								CANADIAN GEOTECHNICAL JOURNAL				51	11			1331	1342		10.1139/cgj-2013-0428			NOV 2014	2014	This paper presents a gradient-based robustness measure for robust geotechnical design (RGD) that considers safety, design robustness, and cost efficiency simultaneously. In the context of robust design, a design is deemed robust if the system response of concern is insensitive, to a certain degree, to the variation of noise factors (i.e., uncertain geotechnical parameters, loading parameters, construction variation, and model biases or errors). The key to a robust design is a quantifiable robustness measure with which the robust design optimization can be effectively and efficiently implemented. Based on the developed gradient-based robustness measure, a robust design optimization framework is proposed. In this framework, the design (safety) constraint is analyzed using advanced first-order second-moment (AFOSM) method, considering the variation in the noise factors. The design robustness, in terms of sensitivity index (SI), is evaluated using the normalized gradient of the system response to the noise factors, which can be efficiently computed from the by-product of AFOSM analysis. Within the proposed framework, robust design optimization is performed with two objectives, design robustness and cost efficiency, while the design (safety) constraint is satisfied by meeting a target reliability index. Generally, cost efficiency and design robustness are conflicting objectives and the robust design optimization yields a Pareto front, which reveals a tradeoff between the two objectives. Through an illustrative example of a shallow foundation design, the effectiveness and significance of this new robust design approach is demonstrated.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0008-3674	1208-6010		WOS:000344848600009

Reproductive ecology of American Oystercatchers nesting on shell rakes								CONDOR				116	4			588	598		10.1650/CONDOR-14-35.1			NOV 2014	2014	Degradation of nesting habitat for coastal birds has led to the use of nontraditional nesting habitat. The American Oystercatcher (Haematopus palliatus) is listed as a "Species of High Concern'' by the U. S. Shorebird Conservation Plan and is declining in the southern portion of its U. S. breeding range, where similar to 50% of breeding oystercatchers nest on shell substrate instead of beachfront habitat. We measured daily survival rates during incubation and chick rearing in shell rake habitats over five breeding seasons in the Cape Romain region of South Carolina, USA. Of 354 nesting attempts monitored, 16.1% hatched at least one egg. During incubation, daily survival rate was 0.938, corresponding to 22.8% success to hatching (nest success). For broods, daily survival was 0.991, or 74.0% success from hatching to fledging. Productivity in the Cape Romain region is primarily being lost during the incubation phase, when nests are exposed to overwash and predation. Mobile chicks may, however, be able to avoid flood events or predators by relocating to higher or more protected portions of a shell rake. Based on comparative data for American Oystercatchers from elsewhere in their range, it does not appear that shell rakes in the Cape Romain region are inferior breeding habitat. Our data suggest that conservation actions targeting nest and chick loss from flooding and predation have the greatest opportunity to enhance reproductive success in this core breeding area, and that an assessment of the availability, structure, avian use, and protection status of shell rakes is warranted.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0010-5422	1938-5129		WOS:000345211600008		
J	Sliter, Katherine A.; Sinclair, Robert; Cheung, Janelle; McFadden, Anna								Initial Evidence for the Buffering Effect of Physical Activity on the Relationship Between Workplace Stressors and Individual Outcomes								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRESS MANAGEMENT				21	4			348	360		10.1037/a0038110			NOV 2014	2014	Workplace stressors can have a significant negative impact on employees' well-being and on the financial well-being of their organizations. Many workplace stressors cannot be eliminated, meaning that individuals and organizations must seek ways to reduce negative outcomes associated with these stressors. One strategy that may help buffer the negative effects of workplace stressors is physical activity. The present study examined physical activity as a moderator of the stressor-strain relationship in an occupation known to be highly stressful: nursing. A sample of 152 registered nurses responded to a survey about their physical activity habits and frequently experienced stressors (patient stressors, staff demands, and workload) and psychological outcomes (depression, engagement, and life satisfaction) they experienced. All stressors related significantly to all outcomes, except for workload as relating to depression. After statistically controlling for the stressors, physical activity explained significant incremental variance in all 3 outcomes. Furthermore, physical activity moderated a majority of the stressor-outcome relationships, such that the strength of the relationship between stressors and outcomes was weaker for those who engaged in more physical activity than for those who did not. These results imply that physical activities may mitigate some of the negative consequences of work stressors.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1072-5245	1573-3424		WOS:000345159700003

We have recently developed an electrokinetic technique that exploits the curvature-induced dielectrophoresis (C-iDEP) to continuously sort particles by inherent properties in asymmetric double-spiral microchannels. Herein we demonstrate that a single-spiral microchannel is also sufficient for a continuous-flow sheathless electrokinetic particle separation. This method relies on C-iDEP to focus particles to a tight stream and the wall-induced electric lift to manipulate the aligned particles to size-dependent equilibrium positions, both of which happen simultaneously inside the spiral. A theoretical model is developed to understand this size-based separation, which has been implemented for both a binary mixture and a ternary mixture of colloidal particles. The obtained analytical formulae predict with a close agreement both the experimentally measured particle center-wall distance and the necessary electric field for a complete particle focusing in the spiral.									4	0	0	2	0	4			0960-1317	1361-6439		WOS:000345262800018

Electric field-assisted droplet formation using piezoactuation-based drop-on-demand inkjet printing								JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING				24	11					115011	10.1088/0960-1317/24/11/115011			NOV 2014	2014	Droplets with diameters from a few to hundreds of micrometers have found increasing applications in various fields. For inkjet printing, there is always a great need to control and reduce the droplet size for a given nozzle diameter and print viscous fluids by avoiding clogging. This study investigates the electric field-assisted droplet formation process under piezoactuation-based drop-on-demand (DOD) inkjet printing. For better control of droplet monodispersity, the Taylor cone is intentionally suppressed to avoid undesirable satellite droplets. The droplet formation process of deionized water is investigated, and some main conclusions are drawn as follows: (1) with an increase of applied voltage, the droplet velocity increases and the droplet size decreases, (2) the pinch-off location may be different depending on the applied voltage; and (3) the combination effect of the electric field and meniscus oscillation can be utilized to significantly reduce the droplet diameter to less than one-fifth of the orifice diameter. The electric field also demonstrates its capability in facilitating the DOD inkjet printing of high-concentration cell-alginate suspensions.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0960-1317	1361-6439		WOS:000345262800011		
J	He, Wenjun; Huda, Walter; Mah, Eugene; Yao, Hai								Does administering iodine in radiological procedures increase patient doses?								MEDICAL PHYSICS				41	11					113901	10.1118/1.4898594			NOV 2014	2014	Purpose: The authors investigated the changes in the pattern of energy deposition in tissue equivalent phantoms following the introduction of iodinated contrast media.Methods: The phantom consisted of a small "contrast sphere," filled with water or iodinated contrast, located at the center of a 28 cm diameter water sphere. Monte Carlo simulations were performed using MCNP5 codes, validated by simulating irradiations with analytical solutions. Monoenergetic x-rays ranging from 35 to 150 keV were used to simulate exposures to spheres containing contrast agent with iodine concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 mg/ml. Relative values of energy imparted to the contrast sphere, as well as to the whole phantom, were calculated. Changes in patterns of energy deposition around the contrast sphere were also investigated.Results: Small contrast spheres can increase local absorbed dose by a factor of 13, but the corresponding increase in total energy absorbed was negligible (<1%). The highest localized dose increases were found to occur at incident photon energies of about 60 keV. For a concentration of about 10 mg/ml, typical of clinical practice, localized absorbed doses were generally increased by about a factor of two. At this concentration of 10 mg/ml, the maximum increase in total energy deposition in the phantom was only 6%. These simulations demonstrated that increases in contrast sphere doses were offset by corresponding dose reductions at distal and posterior locations.Conclusions: Adding iodine can result in values of localized absorbed dose increasing by more than an order of magnitude, but the total energy deposition is generally very modest (i.e., < 10%). Their data show that adding iodine primarily changes the pattern of energy deposition in the irradiated region, rather than increasing patient doses per se.

Illuminating nano-bio interactions: A spectroscopic perspective								MRS BULLETIN				39	11			990	995		10.1557/mrs.2014.248			NOV 2014	2014	Engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) strongly interact with biomolecules and cells due to their similar size scales. Consequently, ENMs are beginning to emerge as new medical diagnostic tools, probes in cell biology, and delivery vehicles, compelling us to understand the interactions at the nano-bio interface. Optical spectroscopic tools are excellent probes to characterize ENMs and investigate their interactions with complex biological systems, including biomolecules, cells, and even whole animals alike. Here, we discuss the role of many optical spectroscopic techniques such as fluorescence, Raman, surface plasmon, and infrared spectroscopy in elucidating nano-bio interactions. While these spectroscopic tools have the ability to provide valuable information on ENM distribution in biosystems, ENM interaction with proteins, and the mechanisms by which ENMs elicit an adverse physiological response, there are many challenges that remain to be addressed to improve their scope, resolution, and throughput.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0883-7694	1938-1425		WOS:000345121300019		
J	Zarnoch, Stanley J.; Blake, John I.; Parresol, Bernard R.								Are prescribed fire and thinning dominant processes affecting snag occurrence at a landscape scale?								FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT				331				144	152		10.1016/j.foreco.2014.08.007			NOV 1 2014	2014	Snags are standing dead trees that are an important component in the nesting habitat of birds and other species. Although snag availability is believed to limit populations in managed and non-managed forests, little data are available to evaluate the relative effect of stand conditions and management on snag occurrence. We analyzed point sample data from an intensive forest inventory within an 80,000 ha landscape for four major forest types to support the hypotheses that routine low-intensity prescribed fire would increase, and thinning would decrease, snag occurrence. We employed path analysis to define a priori causal relationships to determine the direct and indirect effects of site quality, age, relative stand density index and fire for all forest types and thinning effects for loblolly pine and longleaf pine. Stand age was an important direct effect for loblolly pine, mixed pine-hardwoods and hardwoods, but not for longleaf pine. Snag occurrence in loblolly pine was increased by prescribed fire and decreased by thinning which confirmed our initial hypotheses. Although fire was not important in mixed pine-hardwoods, it was for hardwoods but the relationship depended on site quality. For longleaf pine the relative stand density index was the dominant variable affecting snag occurrence, which increased as the density index decreased. Site quality, age and thinning had significant indirect effects on snag occurrence in longleaf pine through their effects on the density index. Although age is an important condition affecting snag occurrence for most forest types, path analysis revealed that fire and density management practices within certain forest types can also have major beneficial effects, particularly in stands less than 60 years old.

In many areas, ungulate populations are now largely confined within a network of loosely connected protected areas. These metapopulations face gene flow restriction and run the risk of genetic diversity erosion. In this context, we assessed the "genetic health" of free ranging southern African Cape buffalo populations (S.c. caffer) and investigated the origins of their current genetic structure. The analyses were based on 264 samples from 6 southern African countries that were genotyped for 14 autosomal and 3 Y-chromosomal microsatellites.Results: The analyses differentiated three significant genetic clusters, hereafter referred to as Northern (N), Central (C) and Southern (S) clusters. The results suggest that splitting of the N and C clusters occurred around 6000 to 8400 years ago. Both N and C clusters displayed high genetic diversity (mean allelic richness (A(r)) of 7.217, average genetic diversity over loci of 0.594, mean private alleles (P-a) of 11), low differentiation, and an absence of an inbreeding depression signal (mean F-IS = 0.037). The third (S) cluster, a tiny population enclosed within a small isolated protected area, likely originated from a more recent isolation and experienced genetic drift (F-IS = 0.062, mean A(r) = 6.160, P-a = 2). This study also highlighted the impact of translocations between clusters on the genetic structure of several African buffalo populations. Lower differentiation estimates were observed between C and N sampling localities that experienced translocation over the last century.Conclusions: We showed that the current genetic structure of southern African Cape buffalo populations results from both ancient and recent processes. The splitting time of N and C clusters suggests that the current pattern results from human-induced factors and/or from the aridification process that occurred during the Holocene period. The more recent S cluster genetic drift probably results of processes that occurred over the last centuries (habitat fragmentation, diseases). Management practices of African buffalo populations should consider the micro-evolutionary changes highlighted in the present study.									4	0	0	4	1	4			1471-2148			WOS:000344956900001	25367154

Comparison of the calculated input impedance of the equivalent circuit with full-wave simulations demonstrates reasonable agreement over a broad frequency range that includes the first resonant frequency, where the antenna usually operates. Application of the equivalent circuit does not require an EM solver and it is readily implemented in circuit simulators.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0018-926X	1558-2221		WOS:000344588900054

Inactivation of Pathogens during Aerobic Composting of Fresh and Aged Dairy Manure and Different Carbon Amendments								JOURNAL OF FOOD PROTECTION				77	11			1911	1918		10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-14-194			NOV 2014	2014	Two separate studies were conducted to address the condition and the type of feedstocks used during composting of dairy manure. In each study, physical (temperature), chemical (ammonia, volatile acids, and pH), and biological (Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, and Escherichia coli O157:H7) parameters were monitored during composting in bioreactors to assess the degree to which they were affected by the experimental variables and, ultimately, the ability of the chemical and physical parameters to predict the fate of pathogens during composting. Compost mixtures that contained either aged dairy manure or pine needles had reduced heat generation; therefore, pathogen reduction took longer than if fresh manure or carbon amendments of wheat straw or peanut hulls were used. Based on regression models derived from these results, ammonia concentration, in addition to heat, were the primary factors affecting the degree of pathogen inactivation in compost mixtures formulated to an initial carbon-nitrogen (C:N) ratio of 40:1, whereas, the pH of the compost mixture along with the amount of heat exposure were most influential in compost mixtures formulated to an initial C:N ratio of 30:1. Further studies are needed to validate these models so that additional criteria in addition to time and temperature can be used to evaluate the microbiological safety of composted manures.									4	0	0	3	0	4			0362-028X	1944-9097		WOS:000344717400010	25364925	
J	Simon, Curtis								SECTORAL CHANGE AND UNEMPLOYMENT DURING THE GREAT RECESSION, IN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE								JOURNAL OF REGIONAL SCIENCE				54	5			828	855		10.1111/jors.12126			NOV 2014	2014	I examine the effect of sectoral change on U.S. state unemployment during the Great Recession. Of the 4.1 percentage point increase in mean state unemployment between 2007 and 2009, increased structural change explains 0.6-1.18 percentage points, and increased estimated effects of structural change 0.8-2.7 percentage points. Despite the role of housing in the recession, neither construction nor any other one sector can account for the results. Although the pace and role of structural change had returned to normal levels after the Great Recession, their effects persisted, raising mean state unemployment by 0.9-2.3 percentage points in 2011.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0022-4146	1467-9787		WOS:000344556200005
