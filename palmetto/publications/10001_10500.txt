Previous studies in visualization have required high end computer hardware and specialized technical skills. A virtual forest landscape can be used to show different effects of disturbances and management scenarios on a computer, which allows observation of forest landscapes without time limitations. This chapter lists updated methods and software used for 3D visualization of forest landscapes, and demonstrates a fire visualization using Visual Nature Studio and standard computer hardware. Elevation and vegetation data were used to create a representation of the New Jersey pine barrens environment. Photographic images were edited to use as image object models for forest vegetation. The FARSITE fire behavioral model was used to model a fire typical of that area. Output from FARSITE was used to visualize the fire with tree models edited to simulate burning and flame models. Both static and animated views of the fire spread and effects were visualized. The visualization method was evaluated for advantages and disadvantages. VNS visualization is realistic, including many effects such as ground textures, lighting, user-made models, and atmospheric effects. However VNS has additional hardware requirements in terms or memory or hard drive space and sometimes renders images slowly.									1	0	0	1	0	1					978-3-642-12753-3	WOS:000288968400007		
J	You, Lin; Han, Guangguo; Zeng, Jiwen; Sang, Yongxuan								Computing the Characteristic Polynomials of a Class of Hyperelliptic Curves for Cryptographic Applications								MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING										437541	10.1155/2011/437541			2011	2011	Hyperelliptic curves have been widely studied for cryptographic applications, and some special hyperelliptic curves are often considered to be used in practical cryptosystems. Computing Jacobian group orders is an important operation in constructing hyperelliptic curve cryptosystems, and the most common method used for the computation of Jacobian group orders is by computing the zeta functions or the characteristic polynomials of the related hyperelliptic curves. For the hyperelliptic curve C(q): v(2) = u(p) + au + b over the field F(q) with q being a power of an odd prime p, Duursma and Sakurai obtained its characteristic polynomial for q = p, a = -1, and b is an element of F(p). In this paper, we determine the characteristic polynomials of C(q) over the finite field F(pn) for n = 1, 2 and a, b is an element of F(pn). We also give some computational data which show that many of those curves have large prime factors in their Jacobian group orders, which are both practical and vital for the constructions of efficient and secure hyperelliptic curve cryptosystems.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1024-123X			WOS:000293578400001

There is a well-established literature on such pullbacks. In the case that m = n Garrett showed that the pullback is actually a cusp form in each variable separately. Here we generalize this result showing the pullback is cuspidal in the smaller variable in the case m not equal n.

To serve as an external referent, a group of industrial and organisational psychologists (N = 31) rated the perceived trainability of each KSAO. Analyses revealed only limited support for the validity of inferences drawn from job experts' needed-at-entry ratings. Consistent with our hypotheses, less validity evidence was found for ratings of the more person-oriented and abstract "AO" attributes than for the more job-oriented and concrete "KS" attributes. In general, job experts tended to rate attributes as needed-at-entry that psychologists thought could be developed on the job. We also found that failing to collect needed-at-entry ratings, and relying on only the more common importance-to-the-job ratings, would have resulted in a rather different set of critical KSAOs identified for assessment during the selection process.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0269-994X			WOS:000285389900002

In this paper, hyperelastic strain energy functions are developed for a finite in-plane shear deformation of hexagonal honeycombs over a constituent material's elastic range. Effective shear stress-strain curves of hexagonal structures and local cell wall deformation are investigated using the finite element based homogenization method. The hyperelastic models, which are only related to the effective properties of a honeycomb, may not be good enough to capture the nonlinear behavior at a high macroscopic shear strain level. The primary microscopic cell wall deformation mode under macroscopic in-plane shear loading was identified to be the bending of the vertical cell wall h, which is perpendicular to the macroscopic loading direction. The re-entrant hexagonal structures having a negative Poisson's ratio shows a high macroscopic shear flexible property associated with the high h when the honeycombs are designed to have the same macroscopic shear modulus.

J	Urien, Bertrand; Kilbourne, William								Generativity and Self-Enhancement Values in Eco-Friendly Behavioral Intentions and Environmentally Responsible Consumption Behavior								PSYCHOLOGY & MARKETING				28	1			69	90		10.1002/mar.20381			JAN 2011	2011	During the past 35 years, academic researchers have been examining the relationship between environmentally responsible consumption behavior and numerous antecedent variables. Because sustainability requires a long-term perspective, the study included generativity, a construct developed by Erikson (1950) and self-enhancement values (Schwartz, 1994) as antecedent variables for environmentally responsible consumption behavior. Generativity refers to individuals' beliefs that their current behavior has consequences that extend into future generations, while self-enhancement refers to values relating to power, wealth, and influence. These variables are related in that generativity requires consideration of others while self-enhancement generally refers to considering only one's self. This suggests that individuals high on generativity ought to be more aware of and concerned about the environment and should modify their behavior accordingly, and those who are high on self-enhancement should be less concerned or willing to change behavior. The results of the study, including French and American respondents, indicate that individuals who score high on generativity are more likely to have eco-friendly intentions and more environmentally responsible consumption behaviors, but generativity interacts with self-enhancement, resulting in an interpretation that is different from that typically found in environmentally related studies.

Individuals responded to Palm Pilot computers when they experienced an interaction over the course of four days. Following each interaction, participants rated the self-presentational effort they put forth, closeness to the interaction partner, and their interaction satisfaction. They also identified their relationship satisfaction for frequent interaction partners. Results of multilevel models revealed that effort was positively related to relationship satisfaction when participants were not very close to the partner, but was negatively related to relationship satisfaction when closeness to the partner was high. Effort was also less strongly related to satisfaction with the interaction when participants were closer to their interaction partner. The results reveal the importance of reduced effort towards interactions with close others, perhaps allowing individuals a obackstageo environment to recuperate.									4	1	0	0	0	5			1529-8868			WOS:000285517800002

The effects of extended work under sleep deprivation conditions on team-based performance								ERGONOMICS				54	7			587	596		10.1080/00140139.2011.592599			2011	2011	Teamwork is becoming increasingly common in today's workplaces; however, little research has examined how well teams perform under sleep deprivation conditions. The purpose of the current study was to examine the effect of extended work under sleep deprivation conditions on team performance. A total of 24 participants were sleep deprived for 30 h and completed 16 h of sustained operations during the last portion of the sleep deprivation period. The participants completed the Wombat, a complex task including vigilance and cognitive components, with a partner in four 24-min testing sessions during the sustained operations period. The results indicated that team performance increased during the work period while, within each testing session, team performance on vigilance tasks remained stable and overall performance decreased. The current results suggest that performance on two-person teams results in improved performance but does not fully counteract the decreases in performance within each work period. Performance in two-person teams increased across an extended work shift under sleep deprivation conditions. However, vigilance performance remained stable while overall performance decreased when examining performance in 8-min segments. These results suggest that averaging team-based performance over a longer testing period may mask the negative effects of sleep deprivation.									8	0	0	3	0	8			0014-0139			WOS:000299922900001	21770747

As one of the most promising thin film deposition techniques, air atomizing spray pyrolysis, which uses compressed air to disrupt the liquid stream into droplets, has been favored in scientific and engineering communities. However, the effects of operating conditions such as liquid flow rate, atomizing air pressure, fan air pressure, and air gap on the geometric properties of deposited thin film are still not systematically studied. The objective of this study is to experimentally investigate the effects of air spraying operating conditions on the surface roughness and thickness of deposited zinc oxide (ZnO) thin film. It is found 1) The surface roughness increases with the liquid flow rate, but decreases with the atomizing air pressure, fan air pressure, and air gap; 2) The surface roughness decreases along both the X and Y directions under any given operating condition; 3) The thickness increases with the liquid flow rate and the atomizing air pressure, but decreases with the fan air pressure and the air gap; and 4) The thickness generally changes differently along the X and Y directions. Along the X direction, it decreases monotonically; however, along the Y direction, it increases first then decreases as in a saddle shape. While ZnO film deposition is studied, it is expected that the above conclusions may be applicable in air spraying other materials.

Multiple aspects are incorporated in surface integrity, such as surface finish, changes in microstructure, and consequently residual stresses. This research focuses on detection of the presence of the subsurface damage and estimation of the depth of the damage, as related to the changes in microstructure. A statistically-based methodology for estimation or the depth of the machining affected zone (MAZ) using scanning electron microscope (SEM) images is developed and incorporated in MATLAB software, with the objective of having an automated and also more exact method than optical evaluation. The method is applied for estimation of the depth of the MAZ for nickel-based superalloys. The results of this work are being extended to correlate the MAZ with cutting parameters and conditions to determine the onset of subsurface damage, predict the extent of the MAZ and, ultimately, control its characteristics. Furthermore, this method can be extended for the analysis of different aspects of the microstructure (i.e., dimensions of grains) and estimating the amount of strain and residual stress in the damaged layer.

B	Salandro, Wesley A.; Bunget, Cristina; Mears, Laine			ASME					MODELING AND QUANTIFICATION OF THE ELECTROPLASTIC EFFECT WHEN BENDING STAINLESS STEEL SHEET METAL								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING CONFERENCE 2010, VOL 1								581	590					2011	2011	Automotive manufacturers are continuously striving to meet economic demands by designing and manufacturing more efficient and better performing vehicles. To aid this effort, many manufacturers are using different design strategies such to reduce the overall size/weight of certain automotive components without compromising strength or durability. Stainless steel is a popular material for such uses (i.e. bumpers and fuel tanks) since it possesses both high strength and ductility, and it is relatively light for its strength. However, with current forming processes (e.g., hot working, incremental forming, and superplastic forming), extremely complex components cannot always be easily produced, thus, limiting the potential weight-saving and performance benefits that could be achieved otherwise. Electrically-Assisted Manufacturing (EAM) is an emerging manufacturing technique that has been proven capable of significantly increasing the formability of many automotive alloys, hence the "electroplastic effect". In this technique, electricity can be applied in many ways (e.g., pulsed, cycled, or continuous) to metals undergoing different types of deformation (e.g., compression, tension, bending). When applied, the electricity lowers the required deformation forces, increases part displacement or elongation, and can reduce or eliminate springback in formed parts. Within this study, the effects of EAM on the bending of 304 Stainless Steel sheet metal will be characterized and modeled for different die widths and electrical flux densities. In previous works, EAM has proven to be highly successful on this particular material. Comparison of 3-point bending force profiles for non-electrical baseline tests and various EAM tests will help to illustrate electricity's effectiveness. An electroplastic bending coefficient will be introduced and used for modeling an electrically-assisted bending process. Additionally, the springback reductions attained from EAM will be quantified and compared. From this work, a better overall understanding of the effects and benefits of EAM on bending processes will be explained.

B	Jones, Joshua J.; Mears, Laine			ASME					A PROCESS COMPARISON OF SIMPLE STRETCH FORMING USING BOTH CONVENTIONAL AND ELECTRICALLY-ASSISTED FORMING TECHNIQUES								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING CONFERENCE 2010, VOL 1								623	631					2011	2011	A common manufacturing process typically used to create large surface contours in sheet metal is stretch forming. With this process, the ability to create geometrically accurate parts and smooth surfaces is achievable, yet there are certain limits when considering the achievable elongation of the material and the inability to produce sharp contours in the sheet metal. Present research using Electrically-Assisted Manufacturing (EAM) has shown that applying direct electrical current to the workpiece during the forming process can increase the formability and reduce springback of the material, while also lowering the required forming forces. Seeing the advantageous qualities of EAM, this study examines the use of EAM for a simple stretch forming process. Specifically, this research examines this stretch forming process with regards to how the location where the electrical current is applied to the material affects the process, the achievable forming depth without fracture, and the application direction of the current. Overall results displayed that the directional flow of electrical current and the application location did not affect the obtained forming forces or forming depths using EAM.

B	Bunget, Cristina; Salandro, Wesley A.; Mears, Laine			ASME					TRIBOLOGICAL ASPECTS IN ELECTRICALLY-ASSISTED FORMING								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING CONFERENCE 2010, VOL 1								723	730					2011	2011	The constantly increasing economical and ecological concerns in the automotive and aerospace industries have resulted in high demand for improved fuel economy and greater vehicle performance. Lightweight construction is critical for reducing inertial and rolling resistance losses to increase the product performance while maintaining safety and functional requirements. This will open a wide variety of opportunities to implement materials with high strength-to-weight ratios, such as aluminum, magnesium, stainless steel and titanium alloys. However, when using conventional forming processes, these light materials bring about processing challenges: low formability, high yield strength and low strain hardening coefficients. Electrically-Assisted Forming (EAF) is a method of overcoming these limitations. Specifically, EAF is a novel forming process where electricity, AC or DC, is applied to the metallic workpiece through the dies during deformation. Previous experimental investigations have shown that EAF can lead to reductions in flow stress and power consumption, increase in formability through larger achievable strains, the ability to reduce/eliminate springback, and improved precision. This study investigates the influence of electricity on the different lubrication mechanisms by evaluating lubricant performance in an EAF process and identifying potential lubricant candidates for EAF. The tribological conditions have a significant influence on the frictional forces occurring at the die/workpiece interface, thus on the forming load, part quality, and achievable form. When electricity is applied, besides the changes due to surface expansion at the interface occurring in conventional processes, the lubricant is exposed to high localized temperatures and current fields. To analyze this, electrically-assisted ring compression tests are conducted and the performance characteristics of several lubricants are studied. By combining the experiments and finite element simulation results, friction coefficients can be estimated, and the effect of electric current flow on friction characteristics quantified. One goal of this study is to identify possible lubricant candidates to be used in EAF processes.

B	Henderson, Andrew J.; Bunget, Cristina; Kurfess, Thomas R.			ASME					CUTTING FORCE MODELING WHEN MILLING NICKEL-BASE SUPERALLOYS								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING CONFERENCE 2010, VOL 2								193	202					2011	2011	Superalloys are a relatively new class of materials that exhibit high mechanical strength, ductility, creep resistance at high operating temperatures, high fatigue strength, and typically superior resistance to corrosion and oxidation even at elevated temperatures. These properties make superalloys ideal for applications in aircraft, cryogenic tanks, submarines, nuclear reactors, and petrochemical equipment. In the aerospace industry, the most commonly used superalloy is the nickel-base alloy and it accounts for 30-50% of the total material required in the manufacturing of the aircraft engine. It is used for rotating parts of gas turbines such as blades and disks, engine mounts, turbine casings and components for rocket motors and pumps. To make full use of nickel-base superalloys, a machining process must be developed that is capable of controlling and identifying tool wear, and identifying the onset of subsurface damage and controlling its formation during processing. To accomplish this, a model relating process characteristics and cutting parameters need to be developed. Due to high tool wear, the cutting forces increase drastically during machining, thus making impossible to estimate the forces with existing models. This research proposes an update to the specific cutting forces model taking into consideration rapid tool wear. As milling is the most common machining processes used to cut superalloys (e.g., turbine blades), it is specifically targeted by this research. Experiments were conducted under different cutting conditions to observe the cutting characteristics of nickel-base superalloys. Empirical observations were used to formulate updated coefficients. Later this model will be applied for real-time control of the process results, such as geometry, tool wear and subsurface damage, and also for estimation and control of other quantities such as force, deflection, surface quality and energy consumed. This will provide new insights into machining these advanced alloys.

This study incorporates the dialogue of 2 national telecasts (United States and China) of 5 sports to determine the degree to which the 2 athletic superpowers framed athletic performances using ous vs. themo dichotomies. Significant differences were uncovered within discourse taxonomical attributions, leading to a conclusion that the telecasts from these two nations described the same athletic performances in substantially different manners which were largely based on whether the athlete competed for the United States or China.									15	0	0	0	0	15			0883-8151			WOS:000290986800007

The inter-surface forces between standard atomic force microscopy (AFM) probe tips (tip radius similar to 50 nm) functionalized with COOH and NH(3) terminated alkanethiol self assembling monolayers and the wool surface were used to estimate the surface charge per unit area using linear Poisson-Boltzmann-based electrostatic double layer theory. The positional measurement of nano-scale surface charge showed a correlation between the surface charge and fiber morphology, indicated that basic amino acids are located near the scale edges.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1558-9250			WOS:000291359900007	21866220

Past data gathered from students from various disciplines support a first day designed to distribute the course syllabus and explain class expectations, rules, and policies. Additional literature supports a different approach to the first day; one designed to immediately engage students in the course through activities designed intentionally to accomplish more than introducing students to the scholarly objectives of the class. The purpose of this paper is threefold - to identify feasible goals for the first day of class, to present an overview of the limited research related to first-day goals and expectations, and to provide an example of a Recreation and Leisure Studies discipline-related activity to address first-day goals.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1356-2517			WOS:000290410500003

Testing for co-directional interactions using union-intersection and intersection-union methods								JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS				38	7			1347	1358	PII 935708892	10.1080/02664763.2010.498506			2011	2011	When interaction terms exist in a two-factor, factorial experiment, the consideration and analysis of main effects are often restricted to those situations where the interaction between factors is not significant. Hinkelman and Kempthorne [4] softened that stance somewhat and advocate testing main effects when the interaction is deemed co-directional but not anti-directional. A test for the main effects in that situation may be pragmatic to the practitioner and appealing to researchers in other disciplines. Intersection-union and union-intersection methods are examined for assessing the directional nature of significant interactions so that the main effects in a two-factor factorial may be evaluated. The tests suggested are conceptually straightforward and practical and maintain the nominal Type-I error rate. Examples are provided to illustrate the methods.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0266-4763	1360-0532		WOS:000290406300003

ISRN Zoology				2011				1	10				(Article ID 251925)	2011	2011	A phylogenetic comparative approach was used to examine the evolution of the enlarged "sailfin," characteristic of the monophyletic lineage of sailfin mollies (Poecilia: Mollienesia), but absent in one of its species, P. latipunctata. Ancestral character state reconstructions demonstrated that the ancestral sailfin molly possessed the enlarged sail?n, and, thus, males of P. latipunctata have secondarily lost this trait. The strength of female mating preference was measured in P. latipunctata for two known targets of sexual selection, large male size, and sailfin male phenotype. Females of P. latipunctata preferred conspecific males of larger body size to those of smaller body size, but showed no preference for sailfin males of a related species, P. velifera, when compared with males of the shortfin species, P. mexicana. Taken together, these results suggest that the targets of sexual selection may have shifted in this species and that reduction in female preference for sailfin males may have played a role in the loss of this ornament.									1	0	0	1	0	1			2090-522X			ZOOREC:ZOOR14706047475

The estimator also recovers the constant 3D Euclidean coordinates of the feature relative to the world frame as a by-product. The position and orientation of the camera is assumed to be measurable unlike existing observers where velocity measurements are assumed to be known. To estimate the unknown range variable, an adaptive least-squares estimation strategy is employed based on a novel prediction error formulation. A Lyapunov stability analysis is used to prove the convergence properties of the estimator.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0826-8185	1925-7090		WOS:000290293600006

This formulation, recently derived by the authors, is the first NSE formulation that directly solves for helicity and the first velocity-vorticity formulation to naturally enforce incompressibility of the vorticity, and preliminary computations confirm its potential.

For more than half a century, physicians have prescribed medications to help manage behaviors such as hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention. Today, there is a growing consensus that ADHD is a biologically based disorder, and medication is now considered the first line treatment. This article discusses the therapeutic benefits and potential side effects of psychotropic medications commonly prescribed to youth with ADHD, academic and behavioral benefits associated with medication therapy, recommendations for monitoring medication efficacy, legal considerations, and the importance of establishing school medication policies.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0040-5841			WOS:000289887300008

Effects of growth medium, incubation temperature, and mycelium age on production of five major fatty acids by six species of Phytophthora								Archives of Phytopathology and Plant Protection				44	2			142	157		10.1080/03235400902952145			2011	2011	The effects of growth medium, incubation temperature, and mycelium age on the production of five major fatty acids by five isolates each of P. cactorum, P. citricola, P. citrophthora, P. cinnamomi, P. cryptogea, and P. nicotianae were investigated. Fatty acids were extracted from mycelia, and fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profiles were analyzed by gas chromatography. Fifteen fatty acids were common in all species, but five of them comprised more than 75% of FAME profiles. These five fatty acids - myristic (14:0), palmitic (16:0), linoleic (18:2 omega 6c), oleic (18:1 omega 9c), and eicosapentaenoic (20:5 omega 3c) acids - were used to investigate the effects of five liquid growth media (20% carrot broth, CB; 10% lima bean broth, LBB; 5% clarified V8 juice broth, V8B; 1/4-strength potato dextrose broth, PDB; and 1/4-strength Sabourand dextrose broth; SDB), six incubation temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 degrees C), and four mycelium ages (4, 8, 12, and 16 days) on fatty acid production. The effect of medium on the relative percentages of five major fatty acids produced by the six species of Phytophthora was highly significant (P < 0.001). The effect of temperature on production of myristic acid was inconsistent and species-dependent. The production of palmitic and linoleic acids were promoted by higher temperature (>= 25 degrees C), whereas the production of oleic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid was promoted by lower temperatures (<= 20 degrees C). Palmitic acid production was greater in younger mycelia (four and eight days old), and oleic acid was greater in older mycelia (12 and 16 days). Effects of age on the production of linoleic and eicosapentaenoic acids were inconsistent among species.									1	0	0	2	0	2			0323-5408	1477-2906		BCI:BCI201100153131

MONOCULAR CAMERA VISUAL SERVO CONTROL OF WHEELED MOBILE ROBOTS								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS & AUTOMATION				26	1			26	34		10.2316/Journal.206.2011.1.206-3381			2011	2011	In this paper, a visual servo tracking controller for a wheeled mobile robot (WMR) is developed that utilizes feedback from a monocular camera system that is mounted with a fixed position and orientation (i.e., the eye-to-hand problem). A prerecorded image sequence (e.g., a video) of four target points is used to define a desired trajectory for the WMR. By comparing the target points from the prerecorded sequence with the corresponding target points in the live image, projective geometric relationships are exploited to construct a Euclidean homography. The information obtained by decomposing the Euclidean homography is used to develop a kinematic controller. A Lyapunov-based analysis is used to develop an adaptive update law to actively compensate for the lack of depth information required for the translation error system. In contrast to previous WMR visual servo controllers using a fixed monocular camera configuration, the controller in this paper does not require the camera to be mounted so that the optical axis is perpendicular to the WMR plane of motion. An extension is provided to illustrate the development of a visual servo regulation controller. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the tracking control design.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0826-8185			WOS:000289654200004

Alterations in immune function and CYP450 activity of adult male deer mice following exposure to either 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene or benzo[b]fluoranthene								TOXICOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY				93	4			761	779	PII 935077952	10.1080/02772248.2011.558998			2011	2011	Adult male deer mice were exposed every other day for a period of 11 days to either 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA; CAS# 57-97-6) or benzo[b]fluoranthene (BbF; CAS# 205-99-2) (0, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, or 30 mg kg-1). Immune endpoints assessed were lymphocyte proliferation, macrophage pinocytosis, and the antibody plaque-forming cell (PFC) response. Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) activity was assessed using ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and pentoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (PROD). Macrophage pinocytosis was not altered by either compound. Both T- and B-cell proliferations were significantly increased by DMBA at 0.3 or 1 mg kg-1 and by BbF at 10 or 30 mg kg-1, but decreased by DMBA at 30 mg kg-1. Sheep red blood cell (SRBC)-specific-IgM production, as measured by the PFC response, was the most striking adverse immune effect observed and was significantly suppressed compared to control at all treatment concentrations for both compounds. EROD activity was markedly induced by DMBA at 30 mg kg-1, while BbF produced induction at 1, 10, or 30 mg kg-1. No marked effect on PROD activity was noted following DMBA treatment, but BbF-induced PROD activity at 1, 10, or 30 mg kg-1. Unexpectedly, four of six mice in the 30 mg DMBA kg-1 group did not survive to the end of the experiment, and one animal died in both the 3 and 10 mg kg-1 treatments. The calculated LD50 was 20.8 mg DMBA kg-1. The PFC response in deer mice was a more sensitive endpoint than CYP450 activity, suggesting that utilization of CYP450 endpoints in risk assessment without assessment of immune function, specifically antibody production, might possibly underestimate the risk to wild rodents environmentally exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.									0	1	0	1	0	1			0277-2248			WOS:000288661200015		
J	Chen, Guihua; Wiatrak, Pawel								Seeding Rate Effects on Soybean Maturity Group IV-VIII for the Southeastern Production System: I. Vegetation Indices								AGRONOMY JOURNAL				103	1			32	37		10.2134/agronj2010.0153			JAN-FEB 2011	2011	Increasing seeding rates in wide row spacing soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] may improve vegetation growth. This study evaluated vegetation indices of five maturity groups (MGs) at six seeding rates (68,000; 136,000; 204,000; 272,000; 340,000; and 408,000 seeds ha(-1)) under dryland conditions for soybean production system on the southeastern coastal plain in 2007-2009. In this region, MG IV is part of early soybean production system (April planted), MG V and VI are full-season soybean (May planted), and MG VII and VIII for double-cropping system (June planted). Leaf area index (LAI) varied with seeding rate by linear functions at 60 and 90 days aft er planting (DAP) for MG IV in 2008/2009, V in 2007/2008, and VIII in 2008; by quadratic functions at 60 and 90 DAP for MG V and VI in 2009, 60 DAP for MG VII in 2007, and 90 DAP for MG IV in 2007 and VII in 2008. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) increased with seeding rate linearly at 60 DAP for MG IV, V, VI, and VIII in 2008, IV and V in 2009; at 90 DAP for MG IV in 2008, VI and VII in 2009. Quadratic responses of NDVI to seeding rate were found at 60 DAP for MG VI in 2009 and VII in 2008; 90 DAP for MG IV and V in 2009, VII and VIII in 2008. Results suggest that increasing seeding rate may improve soybean growth at early development stages; however, increase of seeding rate above 272,000 seeds ha(-1) may not achieve significant improvement of vegetation growth.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0002-1962			WOS:000286000700005

In support of the TPB, perceived stigma and beliefs about psychological problems were related to the overall attitude toward treatment seeking, and practical barriers were related to perceived control. A series of logistic regressions revealed that overall attitude and beliefs that psychological problems should not be handled oneself were uniquely related to treatment for the psychological problem. Results are discussed in terms of novel interventions needed to change perceptions of psychological problems.									17	0	0	2	0	17			0899-5605			WOS:000288378400007

Specifically, this study introduces and empirically tests a model that conceptualizes e-Marketing as the integration of complementary technology, business and human resources that, when combined, positively influence firm performance. The results from a survey of 522 Belgian firms highlight the importance of how market and technology orientation leads to e-Marketing capability and that this capability is shown to positively influence firm performance by improving customer retention and satisfaction. The results suggest that researchers and practitioners should pay special attention to the complementary resources that are needed to successfully implement IT-enabled marketing initiatives and that an emphasis on the technology alone may not be sufficient.

In the numerical model, we combine two locally conservative methods; i.e., the mixed finite-element (MFE) method and the finite-volume method. Adaptive triangle mesh is used for effective treatment of the fractures. A hybrid MFE method is employed to provide an accurate approximation of velocity fields for both the fractures and matrix, which are crucial to the convection part of the transport equation. The finite-volume method and the standard MFE method are used to approximate the convection and dispersion terms, respectively. The temporary evolution for the pressure distributions, streamline fields, and concentration profiles are obtained for six different arrangements of fractures. The results clearly show the distorted concentration effects caused by the ordered and disordered (random) patterns of the fractures and illustrate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed numerical model.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1091-028X			WOS:000289048300003

The system features a novel fusion routine that combines thermal and visible images in real-time, assisted with principle component analysis (PCA) subroutine. The thermal detector scans the temperature maps of the highly reflective steel sheets in the die cavity to locate abnormal temperature readings that might be indicative of high local wrinkling pressure, while the visible vision system offsets the blurring effect caused by heat diffusion across the surface and provide a spatial reference. The employed PCA uses a new singular value decomposition (SVD) that is more efficient than standard SVD computations, enabling the PCA to be applied in real-time acquisitions (30Hz). The PCA affects the images by reducing the nonvalue data content (reduce redundancy, noise) while highlighting important features. The fusion is done using a pixel-level algorithm using different variations, where each is assessed for performance. The proposed detection system has been tested on an automotive pressline to assess the formability of complex-shaped panels and have shown high detection success rate. Different splits with variant shape, size, and severity have been detected under actual operating conditions.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0934-9847	1432-2110		WOS:000288957300002

AMGA2 is designed to obtain fast and reliable convergence on a wide variety of optimization problems. AMGA2 benefits from the existing literature in that it borrows and improves upon several concepts from existing multi-objective optimization algorithms. Improvements and modifications to the existing diversity assessment techniques and genetic variation operators are also proposed. AMGA2 employs a new kind of selection strategy that attempts to reduce the probability of exploring less desirable search regions. The proposed AMGA2 is a steady-state genetic algorithm that maintains an external archive of best and diverse solutions and a very small working population. AMGA2 has been designed to facilitate the decoupling of the working population, the external archive, and the number of solutions desired as the outcome of the optimization process. Comprehensive benchmarking and comparison of AMGA2 with the current state-of-the-art multi-objective optimization algorithms demonstrate its improved search capability.									22	0	0	1	0	22			0305-215X	1029-0273		WOS:000288672000002

Inspired by Italo Calvino's Six Memos for the Next Millennium, the special issue is structured along six essays that are both commemorative and affirmative, that is we use the work of Johannisson to explore fresh waters and invent new practices of performing scholarship in entrepreneurship studies. In the special issue, six practices are proposed that keep entrepreneurship studies imaginative: othering words and concepts, exploring boundaries, affecting community scholarship and entrepreneurship education, contextualizing through participation and reconceptualizing method. In the conclusion, we emphasize for the future the importance of a curious and imaginative scholarship in entrepreneurship, a utopian movement that attracts investment of intensity and mobilizes the idiosyncrasies of the multiple.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0898-5626			WOS:000287307500001

The scales represent outcomes commonly of interest to environmental education programs and also to after-school and positive youth development activities. First, we developed the scales using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and then we used multi-group longitudinal CFA to cross-validate the model with data collected before participation in the environmental education program, immediately after the program, and three months later. The results support a three-factor model, producing three scales that appear to be valid and reliable.									10	0	0	0	0	10			1350-4622			WOS:000287318600006		
J	Sandi-Urena, Santiago; Cooper, Melanie M.; Stevens, Ron H.								Enhancement of Metacognition Use and Awareness by Means of a Collaborative Intervention								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION				33	3			323	340		10.1080/09500690903452922			2011	2011	Current views on metacognition consider it a fundamental factor in learning and problem-solving which in turn has led to interest in creating learning experiences conducive to developing its use. This paper reports on the effectiveness of a collaborative intervention in promoting college general chemistry students' awareness and use of metacognition. The intervention starts with a cognitive imbalance experience as a trigger for metacognitive reflection, which is then followed by reflective prompting and peer interaction. A quasi-experimental control and treatment design with 537 and 464 participants, respectively, was implemented. Assessment of metacognition was accomplished by using a multi-method instrument that consists of a self-report (Metacognitive Activities Inventory, MCAI) and a concurrent, web-based tool (Interactive Multimedia Exercises, IMMEX). IMMEX has been shown to allow rapid classification of problem solvers according to their regulatory metacognitive skills. Compared to the control group, the treatment group showed a significant increase in metacognition awareness, as evidenced by the MCAI, increased ability in solving non-algorithmic chemistry problems of higher difficulty, and with a higher per cent correctness (IMMEX). These findings are consistent with an overall increase in the use of regulatory metacognitive skills by the treatment group. We propose that the meaningful, purposeful social interaction and the reflective prompting instantiated by the intervention act as promoters of metacognition development. It is of particular relevance that these factors are not exclusive to the intervention employed here and can be embedded by practitioners in their instruction.									25	0	0	1	0	25			0950-0693			WOS:000287439100001

Through the service operations strategy looking glass: Influence of industrial sector, ownership, and service offerings on B2B e-marketplace failures								JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT				29	1-2	SI		33	48		10.1016/j.jom.2010.04.003			JAN 2011	2011	This paper contributes to the emerging area of e-service strategy in the context of business-to-business (B2B) e-marketplaces, which we view as Internet-based service delivery systems that link sellers' offerings to buyers. Although a myriad of new B2B e-marketplaces were launched over the past decade, a substantial number failed shortly after the peak of the NASDAQ in 2000. The bursting of the Internet bubble provides a setting for assessing salient, theory-based determinants of failure and success. Accordingly, we apply a service operations strategy lens and complementary organizational theories to explain how three strategic factors industrial sector characteristics, ownership structure, and functionality of service offering may have influenced B2B e-marketplaces' odds of survival after the bubble. We empirically test these factors using logistic regression analysis on a sample of 854 B2B e-marketplaces.Consistent with emerging e-services literature, our empirical results indicate that B2B e-marketplaces serving industrial sectors that are a better fit with the Internet service delivery systems by high information dependence and low information tacitness have the highest likelihood of success, as do e-marketplaces with service offerings that facilitate collaboration among multiple buyers and sellers. We also demonstrate the positive influence of consortium ownership structure on B2B e-marketplace survival, albeit not for first-mover consortia-backed e-marketplaces. Our findings contribute to the service operations strategy literature and provide direction for managers in the areas of e-service strategy and investment. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Black, Brent/A-8822-2008				Six-Year Performance of 14 Prunus Rootstocks at 11 Sites in the 2001 NC-140 Peach Trial								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN POMOLOGICAL SOCIETY				65	1			26	41					JAN 2011	2011	Fourteen Prunus rootstock cultivars and selections budded with either 'Redtop'. Redhaven' or 'Cresthaven' peach [Prunus persica (L.) Batsch] were planted at 11 locations in North America in 2001 in a randomized block design with a tree spacing of 5 by 6 m and 8 replicates. This test planting was an NC-140 Cooperative Regional Rootstock Project (www.nc140.org). There were 14 rootstocks in total, which included three peach seedling rootstocks: Lovell, Bailey, and Guardian (R) 'BY520-9' [selection SC-17]. Clonal rootstocks included the peach x almond hybrids BH-4 and SLAP (Cornerstone); peach a plum hybrids K146-43 (Controller 5), K146-44, and P30-135 (Controller 9); interspecific plum hybrids Hiawatha, Jaspi and Julior; interspecific Prunus hybrids Cadaman (R) and VVA-1 (Krymsk (R) 1); and Prunus pumila L. selection Pumiselect (R). Final tree size was largest in California, Georgia, Maryland, and South Carolina. BH-4, SLAP, SC-17, Lovell, and Cadaman were the most vigorous rootstocks. Jaspi, K146-43, K146-44 and VVA-1 were the least vigorous, having trunk cross-sectional areas 20-50% of Lovell-rooted trees. No rootstock had a significantly higher survival rate than Lovell at all locations, but Bailey, K146-44, and P30-135 had good survival at all test sites. Julior and Jaspi consistently produced root suckers. Pumiselect (R) had anchorage problems at several locations. Cumulative fruit yields were highest on the peach seedling, peach x almond, and Cadaman (R) rootstocks. Lowest cumulative yields were from the small trees on Jaspi, VVA-1 and K146-44 rootstocks. Fruit weight did not differ much among rootstocks though cultivars on Pumiselect (R) and K146-43 often had smaller fruit. Cumulative yield efficiency was not consistently related to tree size. Rootstocks influenced dates of bloom and harvest, but not in a consistent manner across locations/cultivars.									3	0	0	2	0	3			1527-3741			WOS:000288637800003

Specifically, the heat treatment of the films in the vapor of different solvents resulted in reversible rising and submerging of the nanoparticles incorporated into the film. The thin nanocomposite films consisting of silver nanoparticles (100-130 nm) evenly dispersed in a poly(styrene-b-2-vinylpyridine) (PS-P2VP) block copolymer were formed via melt incorporation. To fabricate the films the nanoparticles were first attached to the P2VP domains exposed to the surface of the block copolymer film. Next, the substrates covered with nanoparticles were annealed at 130 degrees C. The thermal treatment caused incorporation of the nanoparticles into the polymeric film. Thermal annealing of the film in a vapor of solvent selective for the PS block caused the nanoparticles to rise to the surface. The annealing of the same film in a vapor of solvent selective for the P2VP block led to submerging of the nanoparticles into the polymer film. The submerging and rising behavior of the nanoparticles was completely reversible.									9	0	0	0	0	9			1744-683X			WOS:000288162500040		
J	Gallicchio, V. S.								Lithium - still interesting after all these years								TRACE ELEMENTS AND ELECTROLYTES				28	1			56	69		10.5414/TEP28056			2011	2011	Lithium (Li) salts have been widely used in psychiatry as mood stabilizing agents for 60 years. Li found in variable amounts in foods, especially grains, vegetables, and in some areas, the drinking water provides a significant source of the element. Therefore, dietary intake in humans depends on location, type of foods consumed, and fluid intake. Traces of Li have been detected in human organs and tissues, leading speculation that the element was responsible for specific functions in the human body. It was not until the 20th century that studies performed in the 1970's and 1990's, primarily in rats and goats, maintained on Li-deficient diets demonstrated higher mortality, altered reproductive and behavioral abnormalities. Such deficiencies have not been detected in humans; however, studies performed on populations living in areas with low Li levels in water supplies have been associated with higher rates of suicides, homicides, and the arrests rate for drug abuse and other crimes. Li appears to play a significant role in early fetal development as evidenced by high Li levels during the early gestational period. Biochemically, the mechanism of Li action involves multi-factor and interconnected pathways with enzymes, hormones, vitamins, and growth and transforming factors. This body of evidence now appears sufficient to label Li as an essential element with the recommended RDA for a 70 kg adult of 1000 mg/day. Of extreme importance for the future is the growing body of evidence indicating Li can be used effectively for the treatment of acute brain injuries, e.g., ischemia and chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Tauopathies, and Huntington's disease. This conclusion is based upon evidence showing Li as important in neurogenesis as well as protecting neurons from neurotoxicity. Li influences stem cells, both neuronal and marrow derived, thus additional therapeutic implications for this element in clinical medicine to treat disorders associated with the faulty production of blood and nerve cells or as a tool to enhance blood stem cell mobilization for transplantation.									5	0	0	3	0	5			0946-2104			WOS:000286082900010

This study was conducted to determine the best combination of strategy options for evacuating Charleston, SC, along route I-26 during the event of a hurricane or other events. PARAMICS microscopic traffic simulator was used to evaluate the impact of each combination of evacuee response timing and traffic control strategy, such as contraflow, with respect to average vehicular travel time and evacuation duration. Analysis revealed the combination of management strategies that created the lowest evacuation durations and travel times for several types of anticipated evacuee responses. Furthermore, a proposed reconfiguration of the I-526/I-26 interchange for contraflow operations produced additional savings in travel times and evacuation durations. These findings support the use of all lanes for contraflow during all evacuations and provide justification to examine a possible reconfiguration of the I-526/I-26 interchange for use during evacuations.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0308-1060			WOS:000288280600003

Graduate teaching assistants' epistemological and metacognitive development								CHEMISTRY EDUCATION RESEARCH AND PRACTICE				12	1			92	100		10.1039/C1RP90012A			2011	2011	Research in general chemistry laboratory instruction has rarely focused on the impact of the learning environment on the graduate teaching assistants (GTAs). We decided to investigate the effect that facilitating a well established cooperative problem-based chemistry laboratory has on GTAs' epistemological and metacognitive development, and how this may translate into their scientific professional growth. Thirteen new GTAs underwent a day and a half teaching training complemented by weekly staff meetings. They were interviewed after their first semester as GTAs, and the data collected were analyzed utilizing a phenomenological approach. Three dimensions that describe the experience lived by the participants emerged from the analysis: affective engagement, metacognitive engagement, and epistemological reflection. The last two offer a rich description of how the laboratory context promotes GTAs' metacognitive and epistemological development, whereas the former provides understanding about the motivation driving their intellectual engagement. Considering the role of metacognition in research, and that personal epistemology is strongly tied to identity development, and that it shapes expectations and ways of learning, it is our contention that appropriate teaching experiences may contribute to better prepare graduate students for their journey in becoming scientists and to embark on successful research.									15	0	0	1	1	16			1109-4028			WOS:000286519300010

It is accompanied by three orders of magnitude reduction in ion debris which is also low Z and nontoxic. The increased emission is a direct consequence of the enhancement in local fields and is via the simple and well known "lightning rod" effect. We propose that this carbon nanotube hard x-ray source is a simple, inexpensive, and high repetition rate hard x-ray point source for a variety of applications in imaging, lithography, microscopy, and material processing.

Computational analysis and experimental validation of the friction-stir welding behaviour of Ti-6Al-4V								PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART B-JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MANUFACTURE				225	B2			208	223		10.1177/09544054JEM2013			2011	2011	A fully coupled thermomechanical finite element analysis of the friction-stir welding (FSW) process developed in the authors' previous work is combined with the basic physical metallurgy of Ti-6Al-4V to predict/assess the structural response of FSW joints. A close examination of the experimental results reported in the open literature reveals that in most cases the heat-affected zone (HAZ) of the weld possesses the most inferior properties and tends to control the overall structural performance of the weld. Taking this observation into account, a microstructure evolution model is developed and parameterized for the Ti-6Al-4V material residing in the HAZ. Specifically, this model addresses the problem of temporal evolution of the globular a-phase particles located within prior beta-phase grains (the dominant microstructural parameter in the HAZ) during the FSW process. Next this model is combined with the well-established property versus microstructure correlations in Ti-6Al-4V in order to predict the overall structural performance of the weld. The results obtained are found to be in reasonably good agreement with their experimental counterparts, suggesting that the present computational approach may be used to guide the selection of FSW process parameters in order to optimize the structural performance of FSW joints (at least while they are controlled by the HAZ-material microstructure/properties).									5	0	0	0	0	5			0954-4054			WOS:000287964300006		
J	Park, Lucienne; Bae, Hojae; Kim, Young-Teck; Lee, Ji Hoon								Rapid monitoring of alkaline phosphatase in raw milk using 1,1 '-oxalyldiimidazole chemiluminescence detection								ANALYTICAL METHODS				3	1			156	160		10.1039/c0ay00383b			JAN 2011	2011	A simple biosensor with 1,1'-oxalyldiimidazole chemiluminescence (ODI-CL) detection capable of rapidly quantifying and screening alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in raw and pasteurized milk was developed as an indicator for confirming whether commercial milk is properly pasteurized. Fluorescein was formed when standards containing 1.0% milk with different activities of ALP and samples containing 1.0% raw milk were incubated with fluorescein diphosphate (FDP) for 15 min at room temperature. The relative CL intensity of fluorescein measured with the addition of 80 mM H(2)O(2) and ODI formed from the reaction of 2.0 mu M bis(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl) oxalate and 10.0 mu M 4-methyl imidazole in ethyl acetate was proportional to the concentration of ALP in milk. The range (39 similar to 2500 mU/L) of linear calibration curve (R(2) = 0.998) for the quantification of ALP in milk using ODI-CL detection was wider than those using currently applied fluorescence and 1,2-dioxetane CL detections. Also, the limit of detection (3.7 mU/L) determined using the former detection, which has good precision, was lower than those reported using the latter detections. In conclusion, the cost-effective and highly sensitive biosensor with ODI-CL detection can be applied to monitor whether milk is pasteurized according to acceptable ALP activities threshold level (350 mU/L) for public safety newly adopted by US and EU and the internal investigation level (100 mU/L) proposed by EU.									6	0	0	4	0	6			1759-9660			WOS:000287294200021

We hypothesized that adaptation of femoral head bone mineral density (BMD) patterns to focal loading during postnatal development could be used to identify hips at risk of degeneration. Evolving BMD patterns of the femoral head secondary center of ossification (SCO) were quantified and tested for differences with hip subluxation and degeneration. BMD was measured using quantitative computed tomography of hips in a canine model of DDH from 4 weeks to early skeletal maturity at 32 weeks. During body weight and SCO volumetric growth deceleration, SCO mean BMD increased rapidly and local regions of high BMD formed. Greater subluxation was associated with a lower mean BMD up to 14 weeks. At 32 weeks, greater subluxation was associated with a larger area of high BMD that was more laterally located and had a greater maximum BMD. BMD differences were associated with a higher probability of cartilage degeneration. Measurement and visualization of BMD pattern changes due to altered mechanical loading provide a basis for identifying hips at risk of early onset OA and a tool for surgical planning of contact stress reduction procedures.									4	0	0	4	1	4			0090-6964	1573-9686		WOS:000287213100008	20845071

Accounting for property characteristics and proximity to the casinos, casinos are found to have a significantly positive influence on retail property values. The effect is stronger within a 5-mile radius of the casinos, suggesting that casinos have a complementary, rather than substitution, effect on other businesses. This provides some of the first micro-level empirical evidence to support the "drawing power" of casinos and the impact of consumer spending on surrounding businesses. The model developed and tested in this study can be applied to other casino jurisdictions to gain further evidence on the impact of commercial casinos.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0895-5638			WOS:000286196900006

Research on residents' attitudes toward tourism has traditionally focused on demographic, socioeconomic, and spatial predictor variables, with relatively few consistent findings. Based on the experience use history concept from the leisure and outdoor recreation literature, this study explores a new framework for understanding residents' attitudes toward tourism in two distinct destinations in South Carolina, United States. Tourism use history was used to create resident groups within each community and assess attitudes about who should develop tourism (e. g., local businesses, outside investors and developers, government, or a public-private partnership) and government support for tourism businesses. Results are discussed in relation to the stage of tourism development in each destination. Further development and testing of tourism use history is recommended.									13	1	0	1	0	14			0047-2875			WOS:000286136200006

Laboratory testing of mathematical models for high-concentration fluid mud turbidity currents								OCEAN ENGINEERING				38	1			256	270		10.1016/j.oceaneng.2010.10.020			JAN 2011	2011	The propagation characteristics of fluid mud turbidity currents were investigated experimentally and theoretically. Parameterizations for propagation phase transition times from slumping to self-similar and self-similar to viscous phases are proposed. Predictive capabilities of different mathematical models that fall into three different modeling approaches (force-balance, box, shallow water) were evaluated for fluid mud turbidity current propagation using our experimental observations. For the slumping and self-similar phases, the box and force-balance models showed superior predictive capabilities than the one-layer shallow water models with deep ambient condition. Fluid mud turbidity currents have a non-Newtonian rheology and their transition and propagation characteristics in the viscous phase differ vastly from the Newtonian currents. We derived and presented a viscous force-balance expression for the propagation of a non-Newtonian power-law fluid current. We then experimentally evaluated the predictive capability of this force-balance and the viscous shallow water model by Di Federico et al. (2006). Both models' predictions are observed to be in notably good agreement with the experimental data. The results of this study are expected to be useful for preliminary swift calculations of the fluid mud turbidity current propagation characteristics as well as in deciding whether more detailed calculations at the expense of complexity are required.

We study the effects of these structures on the scalar diffusion and temperature diffusion in the context of large-eddy simulation (LES) of turbulent combustion. Line images obtained in turbulent partially premixed (Sandia) flames are used to analyze the scalar and temperature diffusion filtered conditionally on the scalar and temperature, which must be correctly modeled in LES. The results show that for small SGS variance the scalar and temperature diffusion have a relatively simple structure. For large SGS variance the diffusion is much more complex, with the flamelet structure and local extinction playing important roles. The results show that it is important that mixing models for filtered density function methods be able to account for the different SGS mixture fraction and temperature structures for small and large SGS variance.

STABLE COMPUTING WITH AN ENHANCED PHYSICS BASED SCHEME FOR THE 3D NAVIER-STOKES EQUATIONS								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NUMERICAL ANALYSIS AND MODELING				8	1			118	136					2011	2011	We study extensions of the energy and helicity preserving scheme for the 3D Navier-Stokes equations, developed in [23], to a more general class of problems. The scheme is studied together with stabilizations of grad-div type in order to mitigate the effect of the Bernoulli pressure error on the velocity error. We prove stability, convergence, discuss conservation properties, and present numerical experiments that demonstrate the advantages of the scheme.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1705-5105			WOS:000285650400007		
J	Oh, Jung-Min; Geiculescu, Olt; DesMarteau, Darryl; Creager, Stephen								Ionomer Binders Can Improve Discharge Rate Capability in Lithium-Ion Battery Cathodes								JOURNAL OF THE ELECTROCHEMICAL SOCIETY				158	2			A207	A213		10.1149/1.3526598			2011	2011	A lithium-ion form of a perfluorosulfonate ionomer was used as a binder in LiFePO(4)-based lithium-ion battery cathodes. Carbon-coated LiFePO(4) and acetylene carbon black were blended with ionomer to prepare composite cathodes having a composition 60% LiFePO(4), 20% acetylene carbon black, and 20% binder by weight. Cathodes were tested against Li(4)Ti(5)O(12) anodes using 1.0 M and 0.1 M LiPF(6)-ethylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate (EC/DEC) electrolytes. Comparison was made with cathodes prepared using poly (vinylidene) difluoride (PVDF) as binder. At low discharge rates (e.g., C/5) both cathode types exhibited similar charge-discharge capacities and voltage profiles. However, under higher rate discharge conditions (e.g., > 1C, up to 5C) cathodes prepared using ionomer binder showed better discharge rate capability than cathodes having PVDF binder. This phenomenon was more pronounced when the salt concentration in the electrolyte was low (e.g., 0.1 M LiPF(6)-EC/DEC). These findings suggest that use of ionic binders can help to compensate for electrolyte depletion from the electrode porous space as lithium ions are intercalated into lithium-deficient LiFePO(4) particles during rapid discharging. Potential uses for electrodes having ionomer binders in enabling lower cost battery electrolytes (because of the reduced need for salt) and in developing high rate cathodes that are nonporous or have low porosity are discussed.

No. CV-111, PI 659502) is a large-seeded virginia-type peanut (Arachis hypogaea L. subsp. hypogaea var. hypogaea) with partial resistance to five diseases that occur commonly in the Virginia-Carolina production area: early leaf spot (caused by Cercospora arachidicola Hori), late leaf spot [caused by Cercosporidium personatum (Berk. & M.A. Curtis) Deighton], Cylindrocladium black rot [caused by Cylindrocladium parasiticum Crous, M.J. Wingf. & Alfenas], Sclerotinia blight ( caused by Sclerotinia minor Jagger), and tomato spotted wilt (caused by Tomato spotted wilt tospovirus). It also has partial resistance to southern stem rot (caused by Sclerotium rolfsii Sacc.). Bailey was developed as part of a program of selection for multiple-disease resistance funded by growers, seedsmen, shellers, and processors. Bailey was tested under the experimental designation N03081T and was released by the North Carolina Agricultural Research Service (NCARS) in 2008. Bailey was tested by the NCARS, the Virginia Agricultural Experimental Station, and five other state agricultural experiment stations and the USDA-ARS units participating in the Uniform Peanut Performance Tests. Bailey has an alternate branching pattern, an intermediate runner growth habit, medium green foliage, and high contents of fancy pods and medium virginia-type seeds. It has approximately 34% jumbo and 46% fancy pods, seeds with tan testas and an average weight of 823 mg seed(-1), and an extra large kernel content of approximately 42%. Bailey is named in honor of the late Dr. Jack E. Bailey, formerly the peanut breeding project's collaborating plant pathologist.									9	0	0	17	1	17			1936-5209	1940-3496		WOS:000285855500007		
J	Smith, Kelly C.								Foiling the Black Knight								SYNTHESE				178	2			219	235		10.1007/s11229-009-9545-5			JAN 2011	2011	Why is the academy in general, and philosophy in particular, not more involved in the fight against the creationist threat? And why, when a response is offered, is it so curiously ineffective? I argue, by using an analogy with the battle against the Black Knight from the movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail, that the difficulty lies largely in a failure to see the nature of the problem clearly. By modifying the analogy, it is possible to see both why large sections of the academy have remained unmoved and also why many of the reactions to the threat have been so unsuccessful. Finally, I offer some very broad suggestions as to how to modify our approach in light of this new perspective.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0039-7857			WOS:000285200500004

New subgrid artificial viscosity Galerkin methods for the Navier-Stokes equations								COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING				200	1-4			242	250		10.1016/j.cma.2010.08.008			2011	2011	We study subgrid artificial viscosity methods for approximating solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations. Two methods are introduced that add viscous stabilization via an artificial viscosity, then remove it only on a coarse mesh. These methods can be considered as conforming, mixed methods, the first for velocity and vorticity, and the second for velocity and its gradient, the former incorporating a naturally arising grad-div stabilization term. In this paper, we rigorously study the first scheme analytically, showing that it is unconditionally stable and optimally convergent, as well as both schemes computationally. Numerical experiments demonstrate the advantages of both of these methods. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									8	1	0	0	0	9			0045-7825			WOS:000285815300018

The recycled binders with the additives were produced using two (i.e., zeolite Aspha-min (R) and wax Sasobit (R)) of the available warm asphalt processes. The main rheological factors selected in this study were relationships between loading and response as a function of time, temperature and frequency using a Bohlin Dynamic Shear Rheometer II. The results indicated that the addition of Sasobit (R) into recycled binders played an important role in determination of the binder properties evaluated in this study. The use of lower performance grade (PG) as a virgin binder (PG 58-28 in this study) was critical on offsetting the change of rheological binder properties due to the warm additives and the aged binders.

Under some controlled fabrication conditions, axially aligned grooves can be formed on the HFM inner surface during typical immersion precipitation-based phase inversion fabrication processes. Such grooved HFMs are finding promising medical applications for nerve repair and regeneration. For better nerve regeneration performance, the HFM groove morphology should be carefully controlled. Toward this goal, this study has modeled the HFM groove number based on the shrinkage-induced buckling model in HFM fabrication. HFM has been modeled as a three-layer long fiber membrane. The HFM inner layer has been treated as a thin-walled elastic cylindrical shell and buckles due to the shrinkage of the compliant intermediate layer during solidification. The groove geometry, especially the groove number, has been reasonably predicted compared with the experimental measurements. This study has laid a mathematical foundation for HFM circumferential instability modeling, which is of recent interest in membrane fabrication.

Although saturated brine is denser than pure brine, there are several plausible mechanisms by which CO2-saturated brine could be transported to a shallower depth, where the CO2 would come out of solution (exsolve), forming a mobile gas phase. In this paper we describe preliminary results of laboratory experiments performed in order to observe the formation of exsolved CO2 as the pressure experienced by the core sample was gradually decreased from reservoir conditions (similar to 124 bars or 1800 psi). X-ray CT scanning was used to measure CO2 saturation and observe its spatial distribution within the core sample as a function of time and pressure.

S	Chen, Kang; Shen, Haiying			IEEE					Global Optimization of File Availability Through Replication for Efficient File Sharing in MANETs								2011 19TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON NETWORK PROTOCOLS (ICNP)		IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols Proceedings												2011	2011	File sharing applications in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) have attracted more and more attention in recent years. The efficiency of file querying suffers from the distinctive properties of MANETs including node mobility and limited communication range and resource. An intuitive method to alleviate this problem is to create file replicas in the network. However, despite the efforts on file replication, no research has focused on the global optimal replica sharing with minimum average querying delay. Specifically, current file replication protocols in MANETs have two shortcomings. First, they lack a rule to allocate limited resource to different files in order to minimize the average querying delay. Second, they simply consider storage as resource for replicas, but neglect the fact that the file holders' frequency of meeting other nodes also plays an important role in determining file availability. A node having a higher meeting frequency with others provides higher availability to its files. In this paper, we introduce a new concept of resource for file replication, which considers both node storage and meeting frequency. We theoretically study the influence of resource allocation on the average querying delay and derive a resource allocation rule to minimize the average querying delay. We further propose a distributed file replication protocol that follows the rule. The trace-driven experiments on both the real-world GENI testbed and NS-2 show that our protocol can achieve shorter average querying delay at lower cost than current replication protocols, which justifies the correctness of our theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed protocol.					19th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP)19th IEEE International Conference on Network Protocols (ICNP)	OCT 17-20, 2011OCT 17-20, 2011	IEEEIEEE	Vancouver, CANADAVancouver, CANADA	0	0	0	0	0	0			1092-1648		978-1-4577-1394-1	WOS:000299431800036		
S	Martin, Jim; Amin, Rahul; Eltawil, Ahmed; Hussien, Amr			IEEE					Using Reconfigurable Devices to Maximize Spectral Efficiency in Future Heterogeneous Wireless Systems								2011 20TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKS (ICCCN)		IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks												2011	2011	As broadband data further blends with cellular voice, mobile devices will become the dominant portals to the connected world. However current design practices still involve building independent networks that each make their own resource decisions. In spite of the tremendous amount of related research in this area, there are still several elemental questions that must be addressed. First, is it better to treat wireless systems as independent access networks requiring the user to handle aspects of roaming between disparate wireless networks or is an internet model better where independent autonomous wireless systems (AWS) cooperate to form a single, unified cloud to users, with network level resource allocation? Second, is it better to have dedicated, low power circuitry that supports a limited set of independent wireless Radio Access technologies (RATs) or is it better to build agile handsets that adapt (reconfigure) in real-time to operate over a large range of RAT technologies and operating modes? The results in this paper shed light on these questions. We present preliminary results from a MATLAB-based simulation study that highlights the increase in spectral efficiency as the modality of devices increase. Our analysis takes into account the cost of radio reconfiguration in terms of the temporary communications downtime and the surge of power that occurs with each reconfiguration operation. Our main result suggests that nomadic users benefit the most primarily due to their ability to route traffic over 'hotspot' type of RATs that tend to have high data rates at reduced coverage, and that this in turn helps increase the 3G or 4G bandwidth available to mobile users. All nodes in the system experience an increase in spectral efficiency ranging from 14% to 75% when compared to a similar scenario that assumes no network cooperation and static radios.					20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)	JUL 31-AUG 04, 2011JUL 31-AUG 04, 2011	IEEE; IEEE Commun Soc; U.

S	Shen, Haiying; Zhao, Lianyu			IEEE					Refining Reputation to Truly Select High-QoS Servers in Peer-to-Peer Networks								2011 20TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKS (ICCCN)		IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks												2011	2011	Peer-to-peer networks (P2Ps) use reputation systems to provide incentives for nodes to offer high quality of service (QoS) and thwart the intentions of dishonest or selfish nodes. Existing reputation systems have two problems. First, they directly regard node reputation as trust. Reputation represents the opinion formed by others about a node's QoS behavior, while trust represents a node's honesty and willingness to cooperate. In addition to trust, factors such as node capacity and lifetime also influence reputation. Due to the heterogeneous and time-varying attributes of these factors, reputation actually cannot directly reflect a node's trust or current QoS. Second, existing reputation systems guide a node to select the server with the highest reputation, which may not actually select the highest QoS server and would overload the highest-reputed nodes. This work aims to accurately reflect node trust and provide accurate guidance for high QoS server selection. Through experimental study, we find that node trust, available capacity and lifetime positively affect node reputation. Based on this observation, we first propose a manual and an automatic trust model that removes the influence of additional factors on reputation to truly reflect node trust. We then propose a high-QoS server selection algorithm that separately considers node trust, current available capacity, and lifetime. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the trust models in accurate node trust reflection. Moreover, the server selection algorithm dramatically increases the success rate of service requests and avoids overloading nodes.					20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)	JUL 31-AUG 04, 2011JUL 31-AUG 04, 2011	IEEE; IEEE Commun Soc; U.

S	Shen, Haiying; Liu, Guoxin			IEEE					Harmony: Integrated Resource and Reputation Management for Large-Scale Distributed Systems								2011 20TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKS (ICCCN)		IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks												2011	2011	Advancements in technology over the past decade are leading to a promising future for large-scale distributed systems, where globally-scattered distributed resources are collectively pooled and used in a cooperative manner to achieve unprecedented petascale supercomputing capabilities. The issues of resource management (resMgt) and reputation management (repMgt) need to be addressed in order to ensure the successful deployment of large-scale distributed systems. However, these two issues have typically been addressed separately, despite the significant interdependencies between them: resMgt needs repMgt to provide a cooperative environment for resource sharing, and in turn facilitates repMgt to evaluate multi-faceted node reputations for providing different resources. Current repMgt methods provide a single reputation value for each node in providing all types of resources. However, a node willing to provide one resource may not be willing to provide another resource. In addition, current repMgt methods often guide node selection policy to select the highest-reputed nodes, which may overload these nodes. Also, few works exploited node reputation in resource selection in order to fully and fairly utilize resources in the system and to meet users' diverse QoS demands. We propose a system called Harmony that integrates resMgt and repMgt in a harmonious manner. Harmony incorporates two key innovations: integrated multi-faceted resource/reputation management and multi-QoS-oriented resource selection. The trace data we collected from an online trading platform confirms the importance of multi-faceted reputation and potential problems with highest-reputed node selection. Trace-driven experiments performed on PlanetLab show that Harmony outperforms existing resMgt and repMgt in terms of the success rate, service delay, and efficiency.					20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)20th International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN)	JUL 31-AUG 04, 2011JUL 31-AUG 04, 2011	IEEE; IEEE Commun Soc; U.

ASEE					CU THINKING: PROBLEM-SOLVING STRATEGIES REVEALED								2011 ASEE ANNUAL CONFERENCE & EXPOSITION		ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition												2011	2011	In order to analyze engineering students' problem-solving strategies, we are collecting work completed on Tablet PCs and analyzing the digital Ink using "tags" to identify events of interest using custom-designed software called MuseInk. The work collected includes problems completed in a first year engineering course at Clemson University (CU) specifically selected for their level of complexity, potential for multiple approaches or representations, and the level of structure and/or definition provided. A "Tag Universe," a database of procedural events, errors, and other items of interest, has been developed to tag relevant events within student work. The Tag Universe is organized into categories based on a theoretical framework of process activities used during problem solving: knowledge access, knowledge generation and self-management. Tags include items such as sketching the problem, identifying known and unknown values, manipulating an equation to solve for a desired variable, and checking the reasonableness of a solution. In addition, student errors are categorized (conceptual, procedural, and mechanical), and students' recognition of their errors are being analyzed based on signal detection theory. This identifies "hits" (student makes an error and self-corrects), "misses" (student makes an error and does not recognize it) and "false alarms"(student second-guesses a correct approach). MuseInk also allows the insertion of audio tags to document students' verbal commentaries about what they were thinking when specific events occurred. A user survey was implemented to identify ways to increase benefits to students using MuseInk. Tutorials and additional classroom activities using MuseInk were developed based on survey data for use in Fall 2010/Spring 2011.To date, worked solutions and audio commentary for three problem sets were collected from total of 26 students (19 males, 7 females). One of the three problem sets has been tagged by our research team, and inter-rater reliability analysis was conducted to ensure consistent tagging. Tag data (written and verbal) is in the process of being analyzed in terms of relationships between tag categories and students' academic backgrounds and prior knowledge about engineering. We are beginning to define criteria for structuring problems to allow students from a broad array of prior educational experiences and academic preparation to develop effective and transferrable problem-solving skills.While our methods, which use MuseInk as a research tool, are evolving, we are also considering how the software is being used as an instructional tool. A user survey was implemented to identify ways to increase benefits to students using MuseInk. Activities using MuseInk both inside and outside the classroom are being developed based on survey data, such as tutorials and peer feedback.

S	Bowman, David R.; Stephan, Elizabeth A.			ASEE					Using GEARSET to Promote Student Awareness of Learning Objectives								2011 ASEE ANNUAL CONFERENCE & EXPOSITION		ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition												2011	2011	In fall 2009, several new grade reporting modules were added to GEO (General Engineering Online), a web based class management tool developed at Clemson University for use with large enrollment freshman engineering courses. The dynamic grade report module provided a live record of attendance and course grades, capabilities for feedback on assignments from instructors to students, and performance predictions to give students perspective on the grades necessary to earn a particular final grade in the course. The implementation of this module led to significant improvements on student evaluation of all instructors using GEO, specifically on questions regarding student satisfaction with being informed of their progress throughout the course. These observations lead to our desire to implement new modules in GEO to further improve student satisfaction and engagement in academic material.Some of the most troubling comments on our instructor evaluations were related to students` perception of a disconnect between the learning activities and the learning objectives. One of the many purposes of writing learning objectives is to establish expectations of content and performance between students and instructors. To address this, we developed a new module called GEARSET (General Engineering Assessment Record Self Evaluation Tool) with the intent to bridge the gap between student understanding of the relationship between learning activities and the course learning objectives. Functionally, GEARSET allows students to track their own progress of the required and recommended elements of study for a course. In addition, GEARSET displays daily, unit and overall course learning objectives in an interface that allows the student to self-evaluate their understanding by. checking off. their progress. For the instructor, GEARSET allows tracking of assignment completion and self-evaluation of learning objectives. This paper gives an overview of GEARSET, discusses the integration within first year engineering courses, addresses how it can be used by students as a tool for self-evaluation, and how use of GEARSET by instructors provides greater insight into student progress.

Engineering persisters (n=751) and non-persisters (n=528) were isolated from a nationally-representative dataset, and groups were compared against a number of self-reported factors associated with performance, competence, recognition, and interest in science. Results demonstrated that persisters reported significantly higher values for factors that contribute to science identity formation, particularly in physics. It was concluded that physics courses can be used as arenas in which to develop science identity, with the ultimate goal of increasing inflow and persistence in engineering career paths.

S	Grigg, Sarah Jane; Benson, Lisa; McGough, Catherine			ASEE					Technology Adoption Behaviors in a First Year Engineering Classroom								2011 ASEE ANNUAL CONFERENCE & EXPOSITION		ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition												2011	2011	Advancing personalized learning is recognized as one of the grand challenges facing engineers in the next century. Technology has provided advancements in instruction which were not previously available, but there is often resistance to adoption of new technologies. Our research group introduced the use of tablet computers in a first year engineering fundamentals course initially as part of a study of students' problem-solving strategies, a key skill for students to master and succeed in engineering. A custom tablet computer software application called MuseInk (c) was utilized to capture problem solving procedures in a manner that emulates handwritten solutions, but uses digital ink to record the solutions. This technology permits different classroom activities beyond the use of hand written solutions typical of traditional courses where assignments are completed with pencil and paper, and adds valuable information beyond the final solution. As with any new implementation of technology, there is a period of resistance and a mixture of feelings toward adoption of the technology that must be overcome to get benefit from the technology. As educators work to make instruction more personalized, effective, and interactive, research on the adoption of new technology is imperative to understand what drives these adoption behaviors to better mitigate resistance to technology implementation. Our research group surveyed students on their attitudes and behaviors toward the use of tablet computers and the MuseInk software technology introduced into the classroom. Diffusion theory is used as a framework to examine the technology adoption behaviors. Overall, the attitudes and behaviors associated with the introduction of tablet computers and MuseInk software followed adoption patterns typically seen with typical diffusion of innovations.

S	Klein-Gardner, Stacy S.; Walker, Alanna			ASEE					Defining Global Competence for Engineering Students								2011 ASEE ANNUAL CONFERENCE & EXPOSITION		ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition												2011	2011	In this study, we collected the opinions of prominent members of engineering industry and academia in order to determine a clear definition of what it means for engineering graduates to be globally competent. The data collection was conducted via an online survey, which was adapted from a survey outlined in Parkinson et al.'s 2009 paper entitled "Developing Global Competence in Engineers: What Does It Mean? What Is Most Important?". The similarity between our surveys allowed us to compare our results to the results they presented. We also collected more demographic data, which allowed us to look for relationships between the participants' answers and the way they ranked the thirteen dimensions. We found that only some of the demographic information correlated with some of the competencies, but not all. Our survey indicated that the top five most important dimensions of global competence are: 1) the ability to communicate across cultures, 2) the ability to appreciate other cultures, 3) a proficiency working in or directing a team of ethnic and cultural diversity, 4) the ability to effectively deal with ethical issues arising from cultural or national differences, 5) possessing understanding of cultural differences relating to product design, manufacture, and use, and 5) possessing understand implications of cultural differences of how engineering tasks might be approached. While more research is needed in this area, it is our hope that these findings will lead to a well-supported definition for what it means to be a globally competent engineer. A definition like this will help engineering universities focus the global education of their students to produce more competitive graduates for the international job market.

ASEE					LESSONS LEARNED FROM A DISTANCE LEARNING RESEARCH METHODS COURSE CO-TAUGHT BY CLEMSON, UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH, AND VIRGINIA TECH								2011 ASEE ANNUAL CONFERENCE & EXPOSITION		ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition												2011	2011	A cross-institution research methods course was developed to provide students conducting thesis projects with an introduction to research development and many different types of qualitative and quantitative research methods. The course draws on the experiences of a diverse group of young faculty to present students with a broad range of best practices and experiences in research methods. Unique to this distance-learning course is the incorporation of team-based active learning activities in every lecture. In this active learning course, students learn quantitative research methods by practicing the set of procedures in class. Students are expected to incorporate their research topics as examples throughout the class. Topics in research methods include: defining research problems, conducting a literature review, qualitative and quantitative data analysis, developing experimental designs, survey design, visual presentation of results, research ethics, and the process of writing a peer-reviewed journal article. The course culminates in students' research proposal.This paper discusses the lessons learned from a cross-institution course collaboration and presents the findings from student assessments and surveys. We discuss the effectiveness of the cross-university course on different types of students, from new to senior PhD students conducting thesis research to masters students conducting term projects on a wide range of civil, environmental, sustainability, and construction research topics. We also examine the effectiveness of distance active learning and peer-teaching during the course. Half of the students at the Pitt location are in their second or third year of graduate studies, and they take an active role in mentoring and teaching.

ASEE					UTILIZATION OF A THINK-ALOUD PROTOCOL TO COGNITIVELY VALIDATE A SURVEY INSTRUMENT IDENTIFYING SOCIAL CAPITAL RESOURCES OF ENGINEERING UNDERGRADUATES								2011 ASEE ANNUAL CONFERENCE & EXPOSITION		ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition												2011	2011	The use of verbal report (e.g. "think-aloud") techniques in developing a survey instrument can be critical to establishing an instrument's cognitive validity, which helps ensure that participants interpret and respond to survey items in the manner intended by the survey designer(s). The primary advantage of utilizing a verbal cognitive validation protocol is having evidence that survey items are interpreted by participants in the same way the researcher intended before the instrument is administered to a large sample. Think-aloud protocols have been used to accomplish different goals in a variety of fields, including engineering education where think-alouds are commonly used in problem solving research. While think-alouds have been used by engineering education researchers, the engineering education literature includes few resources for researchers regarding the use of these protocols with respect to large-scale survey development and refinement. In this paper, we present a protocol based on elements of think-alouds conducted inside and outside the engineering education domain. By presenting results and examples from our own experience suing this protocol, we aim to provide a cognitive validation model which may be useful to engineering education researchers designing their own survey instruments.By following the model outlined in this paper, participants in our study verbalized several issues of concern when interacting with our web-based survey. These issues ranged from minor grammatical errors to serious cognitive mismatches which caused participants to interpret and/or respond to items differently than we intended. Participants were asked for suggestions to correct these issues, and changes were made to the survey based on this feedback. The survey was re-tested in two additional iterations of think-aloud sessions with new participants to ensure the revisions successfully remedied the issues encountered by previous participants. Finally, the refined survey was pilot tested and subsequently reviewed by an expert in the field before being administered at seven institutions. This paper includes evidence and specific examples of how the cognitive validation model resulted in a refined survey instrument, as well as recommendations for other engineering education researchers wishing to employ similar techniques in designing and validating survey instruments.

ASEE					Technology Education E-Learning Model: The South Carolina Partnership								2011 ASEE ANNUAL CONFERENCE & EXPOSITION		ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition												2011	2011	Recently, there has been a steadily growing movement for a more mobile and self-paced education such as that received in virtual E-Schools. To most, this is an attractive option as it allows the flexibility of holding a day job, traveling, supporting a family and advancing one's education all in unison. However, few of these programs have focused on STEM education. Meeting this need, a synergistic partnership in South Carolina has emerged to create an National Science Foundation (NSF) Advanced Technological Education (ATE) regional center for aviation and automotive education aptly named CA(2)VES (Center for Aviation and Automotive Technology Education using Virtual E-Schools).The CA(2)VES initiative is designed to meet workforce needs demanded by the more than 200 automotive-related and 160 aviation-related companies in South Carolina. As these companies drive the demand, the South Carolina Partnership agrees that they should also influence the Aviation and Automotive (A(2)) curriculum. Therefore, the new Technology Education E-Learning Model proposed will focus on the involvement of industry during the development and assessment of A(2) curriculum to generate a workforce that is prepared to meet the requirements of regional A(2) companies. Additionally, CA(2)VES will work to introduce new visualization and simulation tools (virtual reality, 3-D, etc) for next generation technologies to enhance personalized learning. Industrial collaborators, however, are merely one component of this strong partnership.The CA(2)VES enterprise will bring together a South Carolina four-year institution, ten South Carolina two-year institutions, several South Carolina K-12 education partners, and three well recognized regional ATE center partners in the country. CA(2)VES will aim to disseminate curriculum and faculty development materials for two-year institutions, disseminate recruitment materials to high-school and career centers, and hold webinars to provide information about ongoing center activities. These efforts will culminate in creating a SC-A(2) network (and later a national network) for the advancement of aviation and automotive technology education. This paper will discuss South Carolina's aviation and automotive industry workforce needs, the need for E-Learning and the role of CA(2)VES, the center's goals and objectives, and the virtual reality (VR) module development component of CA(2)VES.

Using only visual sensors, the robot identifies and extracts items sequentially from the pile. When an item has been removed and isolated, a model is captured of the shape and appearance of the object, which is then compared against a database of known items. The classification procedure relies upon silhouettes, edges, and other low-level image measurements of the articles of clothing. The contributions of this paper are a novel method for extracting articles of clothing from a pile of laundry and a novel method of classifying clothing using interactive perception. Experiments demonstrate the ability of the system to efficiently classify and label into one of six categories (pants, shorts, short-sleeve shirt, long-sleeve shirt, socks, or underwear). These results show that, on average, classification rates using robot interaction are 59% higher than those that do not use interaction.

This work focuses on identifying requirements for distribution feeder level communications. Due to the large number of distribution components connected to the distribution level feeders, a massively deployed wireless communication network is identified as the potential technology for this application. This network would allow prioritized communication: high priority for abnormal events and system control operations, and low priority communication for asset management tasks. A three-layer wireless communication architecture is proposed in this work to increase the reliability and reduce the latency of event notification.

Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), commonly known as the smart meter, which has the capability of supporting various functions beyond that of recording energy usage, will facilitate this expected increase in consumer participation. Another primary benefit of AMI is load and cost management for the utility. AMI requires a reliable communication system between the smart meter and consumer equipment. This paper identifies wireless networking solutions such as ZigBee as the best mode for such communication. Due to the shared nature of the wireless medium, however, these deployments face security challenges and interference issues. These must be addressed, taking into account the interests of both the utility and the consumer. This paper takes a comprehensive look at wireless security in the AMI based home-area network by identifying a wide range of possible vulnerabilities. Countermeasures that can be used by both the utility company as well as the customer are developed.

IEEE					New Iterative Method for Available Transfer Capability Calculation								2011 IEEE POWER AND ENERGY SOCIETY GENERAL MEETING		IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting PESGM												2011	2011	This paper presents a new iterative method to calculate Available Transfer Capability (ATC) of the interconnected transmission network that can be used in real-time. In today's deregulated power system, large scale power transactions between utilities have increased to supply reliable and economical electric supply. In this situation, fast and accurate determination of ATC in real-time is very important. Existing linear ATC calculation methods are either based on DC or AC Power Transfer Distribution Factors (PTDF). These methods are fast but do not consider control changes such as generator reactive limits and voltage limits as the transfer limit increases. Continuation Power Flow (CPF) can produce accurate ATC values, but it requires repeated solution of power flow and hence can be very time consuming. Optimal Power Flow (OPF) based methods can also determine accurate ATC values, but solution of optimization problem makes it very slow. The proposed iterative method overcomes disadvantages of existing methods. The proposed can also be described as linear predictor only continuation method but it does not require repeated solution of power flow which makes it faster. It also considers the control changes of the system with the increase in transfer limit. The simulation results are presented on IEEE 6-bus and 39-bus systems. The results are compared with the results obtained using DC-PTDFs, AC-PTDFs and repeated AC Power Flow (ACLF).

It is designed to satisfy the requirement of real time stability assessment in the wide area power system. Different from conventional approaches the proposed method does not consider the process of system operation by certain parameter values but by the concept of continuity of system operation. The stability margin is defined by discontinuity boundary. This feature can greatly simplify the complicity of defining the stability margin for different cases. In this paper the discontinuity of the maximum swing angle has been studied for the power system TSA. The operation trajectory of the maximum swing angle is obtained via different fault clearing angles. Then the stability condition is determined by the continuity of maximum swing angle. The value of fault clearing angle, which correlated to the intersection of the operational trajectory and the discontinuity boundary, is equal to the critical clearing angle. The synchrophasor has been applied here to provide the initial condition of the disturbance and to obtain the center of inertia with the rotor angle as a reference.

Development of model-based control algorithms for this new and emerging class of robots has been relatively slow due to the inherent complexity of their mathematical models. Based on the recently developed kinematics, velocity Jacobian and full dynamic model, a simple nonlinear task-space controller, established for rigid-link robots, is adapted and extended for continuum manipulators for the regulation of its tip or any location along its backbone in the task-space.

IEEE					Three Module Lumped Element Model of a Continuum Arm Section								2011 IEEE/RSJ INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT ROBOTS AND SYSTEMS		IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems						4060	4065					2011	2011	In this paper, a section of a continuum arm is modeled using lumped model elements (masses, springs and dampers). The model, although an approximation for a continuum structure, can be used to conveniently analyze the dynamics of the arm with selectable tradeoff in accuracy of modeling. Principles of lagrangian dynamics are used to derive the expressions for the generalized forces in the system. Simulation results using the model are compared with the physical measurements of a continuum arm prototype built using McKibben actuators. A brief discussion on how this relatively simple model can be more realizable when compared to other techniques of modeling continuum arms is also presented in the paper.

S	Willimon, Bryan; Birchfield, Stan; Walker, Ian			IEEE					Model for Unfolding Laundry using Interactive Perception								2011 IEEE/RSJ INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT ROBOTS AND SYSTEMS		IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems												2011	2011	We present an algorithm for automatically unfolding a piece of clothing. A piece of laundry is pulled in different directions at various points of the cloth in order to flatten the laundry. The features of the cloth are extracted and calculated to determine a valid location and orientation in which to interact with it. The features include the peak region, corner locations, and continuity / discontinuity of the cloth. In this paper we present a two-stage algorithm, introducing a novel solution to the unfolding / flattening problem using interactive perception. Simulations using 3D simulation software, and experiments with robot hardware demonstrate the ability of the algorithm to flatten pieces of laundry using different starting configurations. These results show that, at most, the algorithm flattens out a piece of cloth from 11.1% to 95.6% of the canonical configuration.

IEEE					Fast Distributed Simulation of Sensor Networks using Optimistic Synchronization								2011 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING IN SENSOR SYSTEMS AND WORKSHOPS (DCOSS)														2011	2011	Network simulation is an important tool for testing and evaluating wireless sensor network applications. Parallel simulation strategies improve the scalability of these tools. However, achieving high performance depends on reducing the synchronization overhead among simulation processes. In this paper we present an optimistic simulation algorithm with support for backtracking and re-execution. The algorithm reduces the number of synchronization cycles to the number of transmissions in the network under test. We implement SnapSim, an extension to the popular Avrora simulator, based on this algorithm. The experimental results show that our prototype system improves the performance of Avrora by 2 to 10 times for typical network-centric sensor network applications, and up to three orders of magnitude for applications that use the radio infrequently.					7th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems (DCOSS)7th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems (DCOSS)	JUN 27-29, 2011JUN 27-29, 2011	IEEE; Ctr Tecnologic Telecomunicacions Catalunya (CTTC); IEEE Comp Soc Tech Comm Parallel Proc (TCPP); IEEE Comp Soc Tech Comm Distributed Proc (TCDP)IEEE; Ctr Tecnologic Telecomunicacions Catalunya (CTTC); IEEE Comp Soc Tech Comm Parallel Proc (TCPP); IEEE Comp Soc Tech Comm Distributed Proc (TCDP)	Barcelona, SPAINBarcelona, SPAIN	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4577-0513-7	WOS:000299427700030

This has resulted in increased interest and development of bio-inspired computing approaches in software and hardware. One such bio-inspired approach is Cellular Simultaneous Recurrent Networks (CSRNs).CSRNs have been demonstrated to be very useful in solving state transition type problems, such as maze traversals. Although powerful in image processing capabilities, CSRNs have high computational demands with increasing input problem size. In this work, we revisit the maze traversal problem to gain an understanding of the general processing of CSRNs. We use a 2.67 GHz Intel Xeon X5550 processor coupled with an NVIDIA Tesla C2050 general purpose graphical processing unit (GPGPU) to create several novel accelerated CSRN implementations as a means of overcoming the high computational cost. Additionally, we explore the use of decoupled extended Kalman filters in the CSRN training phase and find a significant reduction in runtime with negligible change in accuracy. We find in our results that we can achieve average speedups of 21.73 and 3.55 times for the training and testing phases respectively when compared to optimized C implementations. The main bottleneck in training performance was a matrix inversion computation. Therefore, we utilize several methods to reduce the effects of the matrix inversion computation.

S	Shen, Haiying; Zhao, Lianyu; Chandler, Harrison; Stokes, Jared; Li, Jin			IEEE					Toward P2P-based Multimedia Sharing in User Generated Contents								2011 PROCEEDINGS IEEE INFOCOM		IEEE INFOCOM						667	675					2011	2011	Online forums have long since been the most popular platform for people to communicate and share ideas. Nowadays, with the boom of multimedia sharing, users tend to share more and more with their online peers within online communities such as forums. The server-client model of forums has been used since its creation in the mid-nineties. However, this model has begun to fall short in meeting the increasing need of bandwidth and storage as an increasing number of people share more and more multimedia content. In this work, we first investigate the unique properties of forums based on the data collected from the Disney discussion boards. According to these properties, we design a scheme to support P2P-based multimedia sharing in forums called Multimedia Board (MBoard). Extensive simulation results utilizing real trace data show that MBoard can significantly reduce the load on the server while maintaining a high quality of service for the users.

S	Li, Ze; Shen, Haiying			IEEE					A Hierarchical Account-aided Reputation Management System for Large-Scale MANETs								2011 PROCEEDINGS IEEE INFOCOM		IEEE INFOCOM						909	917					2011	2011	Encouraging cooperative and deterring selfish behaviors are important for proper operations of MANETs. For this purpose, most previous efforts either rely on reputation systems or price systems. However, both systems are neither sufficiently effective in providing cooperation incentives nor efficient in resource consumption. Nodes in both systems can be uncooperative while still being considered trustworthy. Also, information exchange between mobile nodes in reputation systems and credit circulation in price systems consume significant resources. This paper presents a hierarchical Account-aided Reputation Management system (ARM) to efficiently and effectively provide cooperation incentives. ARM builds a hierarchical locality-aware DHT infrastructure for efficient and integrated operations of both reputation and price systems. The infrastructure helps to globally collect all reputation information in the system, which helps to calculate more accurate reputation and detect abnormal reputation information. Also, ARM coordinately integrates resource and price systems by enabling higher-reputed nodes to pay less for their received services. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the properties of ARM. Simulation results show that ARM outperforms both a reputation system and price system in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.

S	Li, Ze; Shen, Haiying			IEEE					SOAP: A Social Network Aided Personalized and Effective Spam Filter to Clean Your E-mail Box								2011 PROCEEDINGS IEEE INFOCOM		IEEE INFOCOM						1835	1843					2011	2011	The explosive growth of unsolicited emails has prompted the development of numerous spam filtering techniques. A Bayesian spam filter is superior to a static keyword-based spam filter because it can continuously evolve to tackle new spam by learning keywords in new spam emails. However, Bayesian spam filters can be easily poisoned by avoiding spam keywords and adding many innocuous keywords in the emails. In addition, they need a significant amount of time to adapt to a new spam based on user feedback. Moreover, few current spam filters exploit social networks to assist spam detection. In order to develop an accurate and user-friendly spam filter, in this paper, we propose a SOcial network Aided Personalized and effective spam filter (SOAP). Unlike previous filters that focus on parsing keywords (e.g, Bayesian filter) or building blacklists, SOAP exploits the social relationship among email correspondents to detect the spam adaptively and automatically. SOAP integrates three components into the basic Bayesian filter: social closeness-based spam filtering, social interest-based spam filtering, and adaptive trust management. We evaluate performance of SOAP based on the trace data from Facebook. Experimental results show that SOAP can greatly improve the performance of Bayesian spam filters in terms of the accuracy, attack-resilience and efficiency of spam detection. We also find that the performance of Bayesian spam filters is the lower bound of SOAP.

This paper examines how trust, which has many possible institutional roles, may be critical to the successful operation of innovation networks and hub firms in particular. A case study from the automotive industry is used to examine the role of trust in innovation networks. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Developing sensors to measure chemical concentrations on implanted surfaces through tissue is an important challenge for analytical chemistry and biomedical imaging. Tissue scattering dramatically reduces the resolution of optical imaging. In contrast, X-rays provide high spatial resolution imaging through tissue but do not measure chemical concentrations. We describe a hybrid technique which uses a scanning X-ray beam to irradiate Gd(2)O(2)S scintillators and detect the resulting visible luminescence through the tissue. The amount of light collected is modulated by optical absorption in close proximity to the luminescence source. By scanning the X-ray beam, and measuring total amount of light collected, one can measure the local absorption near scintillators at a resolution limited by the width of luminescence source (i.e. the width of the X-ray excitation beam). For proof of principle, a rectangular 1.7 mm scanning X-ray beam was used to excite a single layer of 8 mu m Gd(2)O(2)S particles, and detect the absorption of 5 nm thick silver island film through 10 mm of pork. Lifetime and spectroscopic measurements, as well changing the refractive index of the surroundings indicate that the silver reduces the optical signal through attenuated total internal reflection. The technique was used to image the dissolution of regions of the silver island film which were exposed to 1 mM of H(2)O(2) through 1 cm of pork tissue.									16	0	0	3	0	16			0003-2654			WOS:000293644200007	21695291	
J	Guiseppi-Elie, Anthony								An implantable biochip to influence patient outcomes following trauma-induced hemorrhage								ANALYTICAL AND BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY				399	1			403	419		10.1007/s00216-010-4271-x			JAN 2011	2011	Following hemorrhage-causing injury, lactate levels rise and correlate with the severity of injury and are a surrogate of oxygen debt. Posttraumatic injury also includes hyperglycemia, with continuously elevated glucose levels leading to extensive tissue damage, septicemia, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. A temporary, implantable, integrated glucose and lactate biosensor and communications biochip for physiological status monitoring during hemorrhage and for intensive care unit stays has been developed. The dual responsive, amperometric biotransducer uses the microdisc electrode array format upon which were separately immobilized glucose oxidase and lactate oxidase within biorecognition layers, 1.0-5.0 mu m thick, of 3 mol% tetraethyleneglycol diacrylate cross-linked p(HEMA-co-PEGMA-co-HMMA-co-SPA)-p(Py-co-PyBA) electroconductive hydrogels. The device was then coated with a bioactive hydrogel layer containing phosphoryl choline and polyethylene glycol pendant moieties [p(HEMA-co-PEGMA-co-HMMA-co-MPC)] for indwelling biocompatibility. In vitro cell proliferation and viability studies confirmed both polymers to be non-cytotoxic; however, PPy-based electroconductive hydrogels showed greater RMS 13 and PC12 proliferation compared to controls. The glucose and lactate biotransducers exhibited linear dynamic ranges of 0.10-13.0 mM glucose and 1.0-7.0 mM and response times (t (95)) of 50 and 35-40 s, respectively. Operational stability gave 80% of the initial biosensor response after 5 days of continuous operation at 37 A degrees C. Preliminary in vivo studies in a Sprague-Dawley hemorrhage model showed tissue lactate levels to rise more rapidly than systematic lactate. The potential for an implantable biochip that supports telemetric reporting of intramuscular lactate and glucose levels allows the refinement of resuscitation approaches for civilian and combat trauma victims.									26	2	0	8	0	26			1618-2642			WOS:000285781200038	20963402

The lidar observations revealed the presence of a strong mesospheric inversion layer (MIL) at 74 km that formed during the observations and was present for over 6 h. The MIL had a maximum temperature of 251 K, amplitude of 27 +/- 7 K, a depth of 3.0 km, and overlying lapse rate of 9.4 +/- 0.3 K km(-1). The MIL was located at the lower edge of the mesospheric sodium layer. During this coincidence the lower edge of the sodium layer was lowered by 2 km to 74 km and the bottomside scale height of the sodium increased from 1 km to 15 km. The structure of the MIL and sodium are analyzed in terms of vertical diffusive transport. The analysis yields a lower bound for the eddy diffusion coefficient of 430 m(2) s(-1) and the energy dissipation rate of 2.2 mW kg(-1) at 76-77 km. This value of the eddy diffusion coefficient, determined from naturally occurring variations in mesospheric temperatures and the sodium layer, is significantly larger than those reported for mean winter values in the Arctic but similar to individual values reported in regions of convective instability by other techniques.									10	0	0	1	0	10			0992-7689	1432-0576		WOS:000298135100005

To address this problem the Turbopause experiment used four rockets launched over a period of approximately two hours from Poker Flat Research Range, Alaska (64 degrees N, 147 degrees W) on the night of 17-18 February 2009. All four rocket pay-loads released trimethyl aluminum trails for neutral wind and turbulence measurements, and two of the rockets carried ionization gauges and fixed-bias Langmuir probes measuring neutral and electron densities, small-scale fluctuations and neutral temperatures. Two lidars monitored temperature structure and sodium densities. The observations were made under quiet geomagnetic conditions and show persistence in the wind magnitudes and shears throughout the observing period while being modulated by inertia-gravity waves. High resolution temperature profiles show the winter polar mesosphere and lower thermosphere in a state of relatively low stability with several quasi-adiabatic layers between 74 and 103 km. Temperature and wind data were combined to calculate Richardson number profiles. Evidence for turbulence comes from simultaneous observations of density fluctuations and downward transport of sodium in a mixed layer near 75 km; the observation of turbulent fluctuations and energy dissipation from 87-90 km; and fast and irregular trail expansion at 90-93 km, and especially between 95 to 103 km. The regions of turbulent trails agree well with regions of quasi-adiabatic temperature gradients. Above 103 km, trail diffusion was mainly laminar; however, unusual features and vortices in the trail diffusion were observed up to 118 km that have not been as prevalent or as clearly evident in earlier trail releases.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0992-7689	1432-0576		WOS:000298657700013

Arthropods of medicoveterinary importance are well represented in zoos, and an ample literature documents their influence in these animal-rich environments. Mosquitoes are of greatest significance because of the animal and human pathogens they transmit, followed by ectoparasites, many of which are exotic and present health risks to captive and native animals. Biting flies, cockroaches, filth flies, and triatomid bugs represent additional concerns. Integrated management programs for arthropods in zoos are commonplace. Zoos can play a role in biosurveillance, serving as an advanced guard for detecting exotic arthropods and vector-borne diseases. We provide the first review of arthropods of medicoveterinary importance in zoos. A case is made for the value of collaborations between entomologists and zoo personnel as a means of enhancing research and public education while safeguarding the health of captive animals and the public.									4	0	0	5	0	5			0066-4170		978-0-8243-0156-9	WOS:000286841900007	20731604

TE materials can be incorporated into power generation devices that are designed to convert waste heat into useful electrical energy. These TE materials can also be used in solid-state refrigeration devices for cooling applications. The conversion of waste heat into electrical energy will certainly play a role in our current challenge for alternative energy technologies to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This article provides an overview of the various TE. phenomena and discusses some of the primary TE materials that are currently being investigated. Several of the key parameters and terminology are defined and discussed along with an overview of some of the current and emerging technologies. The phonon glass electron crystal approach to new TE materials for developing new materials is presented along with the role of solid-state crystal chemistry and the criteria for higher-performance TE materials. This article discusses TE phenomena, the selection criteria for higher-performance materials, and a few key materials.									157	6	0	6	0	160			1531-7331		978-0-8243-1741-6	WOS:000294028600017

The central pressure at the hurricane eye (center of storm) is one of the key measurements of the hurricane intensity and it is commonly used as a modeling parameter in gradient wind field models for estimating wind speed. The current state-of-the-art hurricane simulation procedures typically assume that the decay rate of the central pressure deficit is proportional to the post-landfall time. Since the intensity and track of hurricanes over the land are affected by multiple factors, such as the land topography and heading direction of hurricanes, it is not accurate to present the decay model with merely one estimator (i.e., the time after landfall). In this study, in addition to the post-landfall time, the heading direction of the storm is also considered in the calibration of the decay model. To account for the influence of the land terrain, the continent of the United States was divided into seven regions, namely, the Gulf Coast, Florida, East Coast, North-East Coast, Great Lakes, inland area and Mexico. An individual decay model was developed for each region. Preliminary analyses revealed that the new decay model which utilizes the combination of post landfall time and heading direction of the storm minimizes the biases (mean errors) and the absolute errors of the predicted central pressure deficits and wind speeds.					11th International Conference on Applications of Statistics and Probability in Civil Engineering (IC ASP)11th International Conference on Applications of Statistics and Probability in Civil Engineering (IC ASP)	AUG 01-04, 2011AUG 01-04, 2011	BKW FMB Energie AG; Bundesamt Strassen ASTRA, Fed Roads Off; Walt Galmarini AG; Det Norske Veritas AS; ETH ZurichBKW FMB Energie AG; Bundesamt Strassen ASTRA, Fed Roads Off; Walt Galmarini AG; Det Norske Veritas AS; ETH Zurich	Zurich, SWITZERLANDZurich, SWITZERLAND	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-203-14479-4; 978-0-415-66986-3	WOS:000392245601048

While the inherent randomness (aleatoric uncertainty) in the debris flight trajectory is irreducible due to the wind turbulence, variation in wind direction, gustiness of the wind event and so forth, the proposed probabilistic model seeks to address these uncertainties through the application of the appropriate statistical methods. The proposed probabilistic model will provide an effective method for predicting debris trajectories in a 3D space, which is imperative when performing regional building envelope impact risk assessment in which a large amount of debris sources and targets must be considered in the simulation.					11th International Conference on Applications of Statistics and Probability in Civil Engineering (IC ASP)11th International Conference on Applications of Statistics and Probability in Civil Engineering (IC ASP)	AUG 01-04, 2011AUG 01-04, 2011	BKW FMB Energie AG; Bundesamt Strassen ASTRA, Fed Roads Off; Walt Galmarini AG; Det Norske Veritas AS; ETH ZurichBKW FMB Energie AG; Bundesamt Strassen ASTRA, Fed Roads Off; Walt Galmarini AG; Det Norske Veritas AS; ETH Zurich	Zurich, SWITZERLANDZurich, SWITZERLAND	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-203-14479-4; 978-0-415-66986-3	WOS:000392245602028

Representative index multi-story building configurations were selected from the archetype buildings developed for the FEMA ATC-63 project. Seismic hazard levels and performance requirements recommended by ASCE 41-06 and modified for use in the recently completed NEESWood project were used. The archetype buildings, originally designed using current Force-Based Design (FBD) procedures, were re-designed using the simplified Direct Displacement Design procedure (also described herein) with a range of non-exceedance probability adjustment factors (C-NE). Specifically, the design inter-story shear forces and the sheathing nail spacings were determined for each structure designed using C-NE. Nonlinear Time-History Analysis (NLTHA) was performed for each archetype structure under the 2%/50 year seismic hazard level and peak inter-story drift distributions were developed. The non-exceedance probability at the 4% drift limit was then plotted against building height and design charts were developed for each different value of C-NE. Given the building height, target drift and desired non-exceedance probability, engineers/designers can select the appropriate minimum value of C-NE using these charts. Thus, a probability-based, multi-objective performance-based procedure for the seismic design of mid-rise wood frame structures is described.					11th International Conference on Applications of Statistics and Probability in Civil Engineering (IC ASP)11th International Conference on Applications of Statistics and Probability in Civil Engineering (IC ASP)	AUG 01-04, 2011AUG 01-04, 2011	BKW FMB Energie AG; Bundesamt Strassen ASTRA, Fed Roads Off; Walt Galmarini AG; Det Norske Veritas AS; ETH ZurichBKW FMB Energie AG; Bundesamt Strassen ASTRA, Fed Roads Off; Walt Galmarini AG; Det Norske Veritas AS; ETH Zurich	Zurich, SWITZERLANDZurich, SWITZERLAND	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-203-14479-4; 978-0-415-66986-3	WOS:000392245603006

In this paper a new CPT-based Liquefaction Triggering Model (LTM) is arranged using field performance case histories of Moss et al (2006). The model uncertainty, mu(c1) and COV(c(1)) of the LMT is determined by the sampling process taking proportional cases from the group of liquefied cases and the group of non-liquefied cases. However, the probability of liquefaction is calculated considering uncertainties of model and parameters by the Hasofer-Lind reliability index and the KCP (Lee et al, 2007). It is principally when evaluating probability of liquefaction that all (the model and parameter) uncertainty considered differs significantly from earlier and widely used only parameter uncertainty considered.					11th International Conference on Applications of Statistics and Probability in Civil Engineering (IC ASP)11th International Conference on Applications of Statistics and Probability in Civil Engineering (IC ASP)	AUG 01-04, 2011AUG 01-04, 2011	BKW FMB Energie AG; Bundesamt Strassen ASTRA, Fed Roads Off; Walt Galmarini AG; Det Norske Veritas AS; ETH ZurichBKW FMB Energie AG; Bundesamt Strassen ASTRA, Fed Roads Off; Walt Galmarini AG; Det Norske Veritas AS; ETH Zurich	Zurich, SWITZERLANDZurich, SWITZERLAND	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-203-14479-4; 978-0-415-66986-3	WOS:000392245603027

Full-scale wall tests have shown that the shear strength of wood shear walls is highly variable. This paper presents a simulation approach for estimating the aleatoric uncertainty of light-frame wood shear walls. In this study, the modulus of elasticity (MOE) of the framing members, and the shear slip behavior of the sheathing and framing nails were modeled as random variables. A probabilistic nail model which considers the correlation between the modeling parameters was developed. The results show that when both the uncertainty of the frame MOE and nails were considered, the simulated peak backbone forces exhibit noticeable -variability. The presented simulation framework can be extended to the house-level to estimate the uncertainty of the lateral shear capacity of the buildings.					11th International Conference on Applications of Statistics and Probability in Civil Engineering (IC ASP)11th International Conference on Applications of Statistics and Probability in Civil Engineering (IC ASP)	AUG 01-04, 2011AUG 01-04, 2011	BKW FMB Energie AG; Bundesamt Strassen ASTRA, Fed Roads Off; Walt Galmarini AG; Det Norske Veritas AS; ETH ZurichBKW FMB Energie AG; Bundesamt Strassen ASTRA, Fed Roads Off; Walt Galmarini AG; Det Norske Veritas AS; ETH Zurich	Zurich, SWITZERLANDZurich, SWITZERLAND	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-203-14479-4; 978-0-415-66986-3	WOS:000392245604110

Here we demonstrate a new method for measuring water flux in late endosomes and lysosomes of intact living cells using time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. Cells were loaded by fluid-phase uptake with a mixture of the Lucifer Yellow dextran (LY-dex), a D2O sensitive dye, and a D2O insensitive control dye, Alexa fluor 546 dextran (AF546-dex). LY-dex responded linearly to changes in D2O concentration and the LY-dex D2O sensitivity was not affected by changes in pH, physiological salt, and protein concentrations. The co-loaded control dye, AF546-dex, showed no signal changes as a function of D2O concentration. To measure membrane water flux, the LY-dex fluorescence in labeled organelles was recorded during rapid superfusion of cells with isotonic buffers prepared in D2O. The time constant of water exchange across the lysosomal membrane of intact cells was determined by fitting the data to a single exponential function. From these data, together with the measured area of the organelles, observed water permeability for intracellular CHO-Kl lysosomes was calculated to be 5.3 x 10(-3) 0.3 x 10(-3) cm/s. This work demonstrates the feasibility of measuring water flux into subcellular organelles in live cells using LY-dex.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0003-7028	1943-3530		WOS:000285702400003	21211149

We study the strategic interaction between hits and niches in their pricing, entry, and innovation decisions using a model of competition under product differentiation and generalized cost structure. In contrast to the popular view, we show that improvements in information and communication technology can lead to either the long tail effect or an opposite "superstar" effect (Rosen, 1981), depending on (a) how the structure (not simply the level) of producer costs changes, and (b) how disparate are consumer preferences. These two factors also determine whether there is excessive or insufficient product diversity. Post-entry product and technology innovation incentives may be inefficient in the long tail market structure because producers can soften price competition by engaging in excessive product differentiation and adopting technologies with high variable costs. These results have implications for various competition-related policies.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1935-1682			WOS:000298872500005

How to climb a tree: lizards accelerate faster, but pause more, when escaping on vertical surfaces								BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY				102	1			83	90		10.1111/j.1095-8312.2010.01564.x			JAN 2011	2011	Many species of lizards effectively traverse both two and three-dimensional habitats. However, few studies have examined maximum locomotor performance on different inclines. Do maximum acceleration and velocity differ on a level and inclined surface? Do lizards pause more on an inclined surface? To address these questions, Sceloporus woodi lizards (N = 12) were run in the laboratory on a level trackway and a vertical tree trunk. This species is known to frequently utilize both vertical and horizontal aspects of its habitat. Average maximum acceleration on the vertical surface exceeded that on the level surface, although average maximum velocity exhibited the opposite pattern. The average number of pauses during level locomotion was lower compared to vertical locomotion. In addition, the average location of the first pause on the level surface was 0.51 m, which is farther than the average for vertical locomotion where the first pause was at 0.35 m. The combination of performance and pause data suggests that the relative lack of pausing during level locomotion allows individuals to reach higher maximum velocities on level surfaces because they accelerate over greater distances. The increased pausing when moving vertically could be a result of high energetic demands of vertical locomotion, or greater microhabitat complexity as a result of branching and/or refuges. The faster acceleration exhibited during vertical locomotion by S. woodi likely offsets the frequent pauses.

Bradygastric activity of the stomach predicts disgust sensitivity and perceived disgust intensity								BIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY				86	1			9	16		10.1016/j.biopsycho.2010.09.014			JAN 2011	2011	The aim of this study was to investigate gastric and non-gastric autonomic responses to disgusting pictures and to assess the relationship between autonomic changes, disgust sensitivity, and perceived disgust intensity. Healthy participants viewed pictures with affectively neutral or disgusting content of either a high or moderate arousal level. Electrogastrogram, electrocardiogram, and electrodermal activity were recorded, and participants' disgust sensitivity and disgust intensity were assessed. No main effect of condition on gastric myoelectrical activity was found. However, stepwise regression analyses indicated that the percentage of bradygastria predicted disgust ratings in case of the highly arousing disgust pictures. When moderately arousing pictures were shown, disgust ratings were predicted by disgust sensitivity, which in turn was predicted by the percentage of bradygastria. Heart periods and respiratory sinus arrhythmia increased to a similar extent during both the highly arousing and moderately arousing picture blocks, while a tendency for larger skin conductance responses during the highly arousing picture block was shown. The results suggest that feelings of disgust may be specifically related to increased bradygastria, which may represent a prodromal sign of vomiting. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Kriging was used to predict average uranium concentrations within tracts. The relationship between uranium and standardized cancer incidence ratios was modeled among tracts with substantial groundwater use via linear or semiparametric regression, with and without stratification by the proportion of African Americans in each area.A total of 134,685 cancer cases were evaluated. Tracts with a parts per thousand yen50% groundwater use and uranium concentrations in the upper quartile had increased risks for colorectal, breast, kidney, prostate, and total cancer compared to referent tracts. Some of these relationships were more likely to be observed among tracts populated primarily by African Americans.SC regions with elevated groundwater uranium and more groundwater use may have an increased incidence of certain cancers, although additional research is needed since the design precluded adjustment for race or other predictive factors at the individual level.									11	1	0	10	0	12			0957-5243			WOS:000285360700005	21080052

We illustrate that through simultaneous localization of optical and thermal interactions in a planar nano-cavity, detection sensitivity can be improved by > 10(4) compared to state-of-the-art. Key to nano-cavity photothermal sensing is the use of novel infrared-transparent chalcogenide glasses for resonant cavity fabrication, as these glasses feature a photothermal figure-of-merit over two orders of magnitude higher than conventional materials. We demonstrate planar optical resonant cavity devices in these glasses with record cavity quality factors up to 5 x 10(5), leading to high photothermal detection sensitivity.

The probabilistic framework accumulates uniformly sampled gaze as Gaussian point spread functions (heatmaps), and measures the distance of unclassified scanpaths to a previously classified set (or sets). A similarity measure is then computed over the scanpath durations. The approach is used to compare human observers's gaze over video to regions of interest (ROIs) automatically predicted by a computational saliency model. Results show consistent discrimination between human and artificial ROIs, regardless of either of two differing instructions given to human observers (free or tasked viewing).					10th Asian Conference on Computer Vision (ACCV)10th Asian Conference on Computer Vision (ACCV)	NOV 08-12, 2010NOV 08-12, 2010	Asian Federat Comp Vision Soc; Next Window Touch Screen Technol; NICTA Austr Informat & Commun Technol; Microsoft Res Asia; Aerograph Interactive Comp Graph; Adelpt Elect Solut; 4D View SolutAsian Federat Comp Vision Soc; Next Window Touch Screen Technol; NICTA Austr Informat & Commun Technol; Microsoft Res Asia; Aerograph Interactive Comp Graph; Adelpt Elect Solut; 4D View Solut	Queenstown, NEW ZEALANDQueenstown, NEW ZEALAND	0	0	0	0	0	0			0302-9743		978-3-642-22822-3; 978-3-642-22821-6	WOS:000392224200039

Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society. Annual Conference				2011				3609	12		10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6090605			2011	2011	This paper seeks to quantify cell settling in the print media reservoir of a bioprinter in order to determine its effect on consistent cell delivery per printed drop. The bioprinter studied here is based on the thermal inkjet HP26A cartridge, but any system that dispenses controlled volumes of fluid may be affected similarly. A simple model based on Stokes' law suggests that the cell concentration in the bottom of the reservoir should increase linearly up to some maximum and that the cell concentration in the printed drops should follow this trend. The results show that cell output initially followed the predicted increasing trend, but then peaked and decreased. The timing and rate of the decrease related to the number of use cycles for the cartridges. The results provide guidance for modifications to the printing process to ensure consistent printing of cells.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1557-170X			MEDLINE:22255120	22255120

Although critics of the novel claim that Robbie Turner and Cecilia Tallis die during World War II, in fact the book not only offers no explicit statement of their deaths, but also offers good reasons to believe that they did not die. Readers who believe in their deaths, then, are seen to commit the same sort of misreading as does the novel's narrator: this narrator's misreading causes Turner and Tallis great suffering, and the misreading by readers of Atonement ocauseso these characters' deaths. Reinforcing McEwan's warning against misreading, then, is the novel's illustration of how easy it is to misread.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0011-1619			WOS:000284887400005

Cryogenic treatment at -72 degrees C and deep cryogenic treatment at -196 degrees C were applied and it was found that by applying the subzero treatments, the retained austenite was transformed to martensite. As the temperature was decreased more retained austenite was transformed to martensite and it also led to smaller and more uniform martensite laths distributed in the microstructure. The deep cryogenic treatment also resulted in precipitation of more uniform and very fine carbide particles. The microstructural modification resulted in a significant improvement on the mechanical properties of the H13 tool steel. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The reaction of CuI and CuBr with one molar equivalent of dmise results in unusual selenium-bridged tetrameric Cu-4(mu-dmise)(4)(mu-X)(2)X-2 copper complexes with average Cu-Se bond lengths of 2.42 angstrom and a Cu-2(mu-X)(2) core (X = I (1) or Br (6)) that's in a rhomboidal structure. The reaction of CuX (X = Cl, Br, and I) with two equivalents of dmit or dmise results in trigonal planar Cu(I) complexes of two different conformations with the formula Cu(dmit)(2)X (3a, 3b, 4, and 7) or Cu(dmise)(2)X (2, 5, and 8) with average Cu-S and Cu-Se bond lengths of 2.23 angstrom and 2.34 angstrom, respectively. The coordination geometry around the copper center in complexes 1 to 8 is determined by the type of halide and chalcogenone ligand used, intramolecular pi-pi interactions, and short contact interactions between X-H (X = I, Br, Cl, Se or S). The theoretical DFT calculations are in good agreement with experimental X-ray structural data and indicate that dmise ligands are required for formation of the tetrameric complexes 1 and 6. Electrochemical studies show that the trigonal copper selone complexes have more negative potentials relative to analogous copper thione complexes by an average of 108 mV.									22	0	0	3	0	22			1477-9226	1477-9234		WOS:000288677900036	21384035

Availability of a tailored online database is the desire for many investigators or research communities; however, managing the Information Technology infrastructure needed to create such a database can be an undesired distraction from primary research or potentially cost prohibitive. Tripal provides simplified site development by merging the power of Drupal, a popular web Content Management System with that of Chado, a community-derived database schema for storage of genomic, genetic and other related biological data. Tripal provides an interface that extends the content management features of Drupal to the data housed in Chado. Furthermore, Tripal provides a web-based Chado installer, genomic data loaders, web-based editing of data for organisms, genomic features, biological libraries, controlled vocabularies and stock collections. Also available are Tripal extensions that support loading and visualizations of NCBI BLAST, InterPro, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and Gene Ontology analyses, as well as an extension that provides integration of Tripal with GBrowse, a popular GMOD tool. An Application Programming Interface is available to allow creation of custom extensions by site developers, and the look-and-feel of the site is completely customizable through Drupal-based PHP template files. Addition of non-biological content and user-management is afforded through Drupal.

These DSBs are repaired by homologous recombination to promote crossover formation that ensures proper chromosomal segregation in meiosis. hRad51 and hDmc1 are two human recombinases present during meiosis that are homologous to the RecA recombinase from Escherichia coli. The hRad51 and hDmc1 recombinases bind the nucleolytically processed ends of the DSB forming a presynaptic filament. Formation of the presynaptic filament is necessary for the search for homology and the progression of recombination. In this chapter, we provide a method to purify hDmc1 and prepare samples for visualizing hDmc1 nucleoprotein presynaptic filaments via transmission electron microscopy.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1064-3745		978-1-61779-128-4	WOS:000292530400028	21660712

Using a theoretical framework that pays attention to the ways in which policy develops over time we provide a microhistory of one city, Austin, Texas. The historical narrative relates the details of the individuals who were engaged in the debate over kindergarten in the early 20th century while at the same time explicating the context that shaped those individuals. We conclude by using this portrait of the past to make sense of the current policy issues and to raise questions about the assumptions that circulate within today's policy environment.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0895-9048			WOS:000288654400003

Yet, clinically important enzyme drugs are for less common than conventional low molecular weight drugs due to a number of disadvantages. Most important among these are poor stability, potential immunogenicity, and potential systemic toxicity. Recent developments in synthesis and characterization of nanoparticles and exciting novel properties of some classes of nanomaterials have boosted interest in the potential use of nanoparticles as carriers of enzyme drugs. In certain cases, use of enzymes attached to nanoparticles can help to overcome some of the above problems and improve the prospects of clinical applications of enzyme drugs. Here, we review recent data on the use of nanoparticles as carriers for several clinically important enzyme drugs and discuss advantages and potential limitations of such constructs. While promising preliminary results were obtained with regard to their performance in vitro and in some animal models, further investigations and clinical trials, as well as addressing regulatory issues, are warranted to make these delivery systems suitable for clinical applications.									4	0	0	3	0	4			1064-3745		978-1-60761-894-2	WOS:000282661900014	20865396

Recently, we have been working to advance several areas of developments in specialty fibers and would like to review these efforts here. The first topic is in the further development of all-glass large core leakage channel fibers (LCF) for robust and practical solutions for power scaling. The second area is the development of wide band air-core fibers with an innovative square lattice cladding and the demonstration of a factor of two improvements in bandgap over conventional hexagonal lattice. These air-core fibers are critical for fiber delivery solution of both CW and pulsed fiber lasers in the future. The last topic is a new development in design and simulation of SBS gains in optical fibers by incorporating leaky acoustic modes. These leaky acoustic modes have been mostly overlooked so far. It is essential that they are considered in SBS simulations in fibers, because they are normal solutions to the acoustic waveguide equations and have similar loss to guided acoustic modes where the acoustic mode loss is dominated by material loss. This leads to much improved resolution of SBS gain spectrum in fibers and to new design insights to the limit of SBS suppression based on anti-guide acoustic waveguide designs.

Understanding vertebrate middle ear development								FRONTIERS IN BIOSCIENCE-LANDMARK				16				1675	1692		10.2741/3813			JAN 1 2011	2011	The middle ear is a composite organ formed from all three germ layers and the neural crest. It provides the link between the outside world and the inner ear, where sound is transduced and routed to the brain for processing. Extensive classical and modern studies have described the complex morphology and origin of the middle ear. Nonmammalian vertebrates have a single ossicle, the columella. Mammals have three functionally equivalent ossicles, designated the malleus, incus and stapes. In this review, I focus on the role of genes known to function in the middle ear. Genetic studies are beginning to unravel the induction and patterning of the multiple middle ear elements including the tympanum, skeletal elements, the air-filled cavity, and the insertion point into the inner ear oval window. Future studies that elucidate the integrated spatio-temporal signaling mechanisms required to pattern the middle ear organ system are needed. The longer-term translational benefits of understanding normal and abnormal ear development will have a direct impact on human health outcomes.									8	1	0	7	0	9			1093-9946			WOS:000290094700006	21196256

Distinct from biologically inspired molecular logic and storage devices (more Moore) are the integration of solid state electronic devices with the soft condensed state of the body (more than Moore). Developments in biomolecular recognition events per sq. cm parallel those of Moore's Law. However, challenges continue in the area of "More than Moore". Two grand challenge problems must be addressed - the biocompatibility of synthetic materials with the myriad of tissue types within the human body and the interfacing of solid state micro-and nano-electronic devices with the electronics of biological systems. Electroconductive hydrogels have been developed as soft, condensed, biomimetic but otherwise inherently electronically conductive materials to address the challenge of interfacing solid state devices with the electronics of the body, which is predominantly ionic. Nano-templated interfaces via the oriented immobilization of single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) onto metallic electrodes have engendered reagentless, direct electron transfer between biological redox enzymes and solid state electrodes. In addressing these challenges, metrology needs and opportunities are found in such widely diverse areas as single molecule counting and addressing, sustainable power requirements such as the development of implantable biofuel cells for the deployment of implantable biochips, and new manufacturing paradigms to address plura-biology needs on solid state devices.

The simulations were performed using a much longer simulation system than our previous simulations in order to investigate the full nonlinear stage of the Weibel instability and its particle acceleration mechanism. Cold jet electrons are thermalized and ambient electrons are accelerated in the resulting shocks. Acceleration of ambient electrons leads to a maximum ambient electron density three times larger than the original value as predicted by hydrodynamic compression. Behind the bow shock, in the jet shock, strong electromagnetic fields are generated. These fields may lead to time dependent afterglow emission. In order to go beyond the standard synchrotron model used in astrophysical objects we have used PIC simulations and calculated radiation based on first principles. We calculated radiation from electrons propagating in a uniform parallel magnetic field to verify the technique. We also used the technique to calculate emission from electrons based on simulations with a small system. We obtain spectra which are consistent with those generated from electrons propagating in turbulent magnetic fields. This turbulent magnetic field is similar to the magnetic field generated at an early nonlinear stage of the Weibel instability. A fully developed shock within a larger system may generate a jitter/synchrotron spectrum.

Reconstructing the cosmic history of metals, from the first population of stars to the processes involved in the formation of galaxies and clusters of galaxies, is a key observational challenge. Observing any single star in the early Universe is in fact beyond the reach of presently planned mission. By measuring GRB redshifts and abundances in the circumburst medium deep into the era of re-ionization (z>6), ORIGIN will discover when star formation started and how it evolved into the present day structures. ORIGIN will collect 400 GRBs per year covering the full redshift distribution. About twice per month a GRB from the re-ionization era will trigger the instruments. The resulting multi-element abundance patterns derived from high resolution X-ray and IR observations will map the evolving chemical composition of the early Universe, "fingerprint" the elusive PopIII stars, and constrain the shape of the Initial Mass Function (IMF) of the first stars. While not observing GRB afterglows, ORIGIN will map element abundances in local structures (z<2) by determining the properties of the hot IGM in clusters and groups of galaxies and the Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM). In this paper we focus on the use of GRB to track the earliest star populations.

Cryptic biodiversity and phylogenetic relationships revealed by DNA barcoding of Oriental black flies in the subgenus Gomphostilbia (Diptera: Simuliidae)								GENOME				54	1			1	9		10.1139/G10-100			JAN 2011	2011	Understanding the medical, economic, and ecological importance of black flies relies on correct identification of species. However, traditional taxonomy of black flies is impeded by a high degree of morphological uniformity, especially the presence of cryptic biodiversity, historically recognized by details of chromosomal banding patterns. We assess the utility of DNA barcoding, based on cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) sequences, for identifying 13 species of Oriental black flies in the subgenus Gomphostilbia. Samples of larvae fixed in Carnoy's solution were used to gather molecular and chromosomal data from the same individual. We found that larvae refrigerated in Carnoy's fixative for as long as 11 years can be used for DNA study. Levels of intraspecific genetic divergence, based on the Kimura-2 parameter, range from 0% to 9.28%, with a mean of 2.75%, whereas interspecific genetic divergence ranges from 0.34% to 16.05%. Values of intraspecific and interspecific genetic divergence overlap in seven species owing to incomplete lineage sorting and imperfect taxonomy, implying that DNA barcoding to identify these species will be ambiguous. Despite a low level of success, we found that DNA barcoding is useful in revealing cryptic biodiversity, potentially facilitating traditional taxonomy. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that species groups currently recognized on morphological criteria are not monophyletic, suggesting a need to reevaluate the classification of the subgenus Gomphostilbia.									28	1	0	29	0	30			0831-2796	1480-3321		WOS:000286476300001	21217800

The Amborella genome is a unique reference for understanding the evolution of angiosperm genomes because it can serve as an outgroup to root comparative analyses. A physical map, BAC end sequences and sample shotgun sequences provide a first view of the 870 Mbp Amborella genome.Results: Analysis of Amborella BAC ends sequenced from each contig suggests that the density of long terminal repeat retrotransposons is negatively correlated with that of protein coding genes. Syntenic, presumably ancestral, gene blocks were identified in comparisons of the Amborella BAC contigs and the sequenced Arabidopsis thaliana, Populus trichocarpa, Vitis vinifera and Oryza sativa genomes. Parsimony mapping of the loss of synteny corroborates previous analyses suggesting that the rate of structural change has been more rapid on lineages leading to Arabidopsis and Oryza compared with lineages leading to Populus and Vitis. The gamma paleohexiploidy event identified in the Arabidopsis, Populus and Vitis genomes is shown to have occurred after the divergence of all other known angiosperms from the lineage leading to Amborella.Conclusions: When placed in the context of a physical map, BAC end sequences representing just 5.4% of the Amborella genome have facilitated reconstruction of gene blocks that existed in the last common ancestor of all flowering plants. The Amborella genome is an invaluable reference for inferences concerning the ancestral angiosperm and subsequent genome evolution.									17	0	0	16	0	17			1474-760X			WOS:000295732700012	21619600

Unlike prior conceptualizations, this framework is simultaneously parsimonious yet inclusive. The theory posits that all determinants of faking behavior occur through valence, instrumentality, expectancy, or ability to fake. We review the faking literature to show how the multitude of factors found to influence faking can be concisely modeled within our framework. We intend for this theory to serve as a guide for future research on faking behavior, and we encourage researchers to explore and adopt the framework in the interest of enabling a more theoretically satisfying approach to the study of faking.									14	3	0	2	0	17			0895-9285			WOS:000299751900003

An Immersive Virtual Peer for Studying Social Influences on Child Cyclists' Road-Crossing Behavior								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS				17	1			14	25		10.1109/TVCG.2009.211			JAN 2011	2011	The goal of our work is to develop a programmatically controlled peer to bicycle with a human subject for the purpose of studying how social interactions influence road-crossing behavior. The peer is controlled through a combination of reactive controllers that determine the gross motion of the virtual bicycle, action-based controllers that animate the virtual bicyclist and generate verbal behaviors, and a keyboard interface that allows an experimenter to initiate the virtual bicyclist's actions during the course of an experiment. The virtual bicyclist's repertoire of behaviors includes road following, riding alongside the human rider, stopping at intersections, and crossing intersections through specified gaps in traffic. The virtual cyclist engages the human subject through gaze, gesture, and verbal interactions. We describe the structure of the behavior code and report the results of a study examining how 10- and 12-year-old children interact with a peer cyclist that makes either risky or safe choices in selecting gaps in traffic. Results of our study revealed that children who rode with a risky peer were more likely to cross intermediate-sized gaps than children who rode with a safe peer. In addition, children were significantly less likely to stop at the last six intersections after the experience of riding with the risky than the safe peer during the first six intersections. The results of the study and children's reactions to the virtual peer indicate that our virtual peer framework is a promising platform for future behavioral studies of peer influences on children's bicycle riding behavior.									5	0	0	1	0	5			1077-2626			WOS:000284227100003	21071784

Typical structurebased drug discovery project begins with 3D structure of the target protein, identifies putative binding pocket(s), analyses its properties and performs virtual screening to find suitable candidate drug molecules. The success crucially depends on both the correct binding pocket prediction and revealing essential biophysical characteristics of the binding site. These two tasks are intertwined, since many of the binding pocket prediction methods relay of previous studies on binding site physico-chemical properties. In this chapter the most popular methods and approaches for both analysis and prediction of binding sites are reviewed and the corresponding URLs are provided. The emerging picture is the most successful methods of binding site prediction are based on many components analysis and thus reflect the complex nature of the receptor-ligand interactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-60805-142-7; 978-1-60805-679-8	WOS:000368726700007

International journal of inflammation				2011				958247	958247		10.4061/2011/958247			2011	2011	Tissue engineering employs scaffolds, cells, and stimuli brought together in such a way as to mimic the functional architecture of the target tissue or organ. Exhilarating advances in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine allow us to envision in vitro creation or in vivo regeneration of cardiovascular tissues. Such accomplishments have the potential to revolutionize medicine and greatly improve our standard of life. However, enthusiasm has been hampered in recent years because of abnormal reactions at the implant-host interface, including cell proliferation, fibrosis, calcification and degeneration, as compared to the highly desired healing and remodeling. Animal and clinical studies have highlighted uncontrolled chronic inflammation as the main cause of these processes. In this minireview, we present three case studies highlighting the importance of inflammation in tissue engineering heart valves, vascular grafts, and myocardium and propose to focus on the endothelial barrier, the "final frontier" endowed with the natural potential and ability to regulate inflammatory signals.									0	0	0	0	0	0				2042-0099		MEDLINE:21755031	21755031	
J	Liu, Nan (Chris); Roth, Aleda V.; Rabinovich, Elliot								Antecedents and consequences of combinative competitive capabilities in manufacturing								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS & PRODUCTION MANAGEMENT				31	11-12			1250	1286		10.1108/01443571111187448			2011	2011	Purpose - Extant manufacturing strategy research dichotomizes the trade-off model and the cumulative model, but fails to explain each strategic result. The purpose of this paper is to propose four key antecedents of a trade-off versus a cumulative model by manufacturing business units (MBUs), and in turn, their association with business performance.Design/methodology/approach - The authors first review literature pertaining to the history and major themes of manufacturing strategy. Next, the authors present a theoretical model with explanations of the methodology and research design used. The model is empirically tested, and conclusions, managerial implications, and future research opportunities that stem from this research effort are provided.Findings - Strategic time orientation, as well as manufacturing practices of supply chain integration intensity and advanced manufacturing technology, are empirically found to be associated with MBUs' combinative competitive capabilities. More specifically, manufacturers following these practices are more apt to realize higher levels combinative capabilities, as depicted by the cumulative model.Originality/value - The paper shows that these manufacturing practices may extend the time within which the MBU reaches its capability frontiers, and therefore, increase the odds that it can exploit its current resources. Moreover, MBU size negatively moderates the relationship between advanced manufacturing technology and the cumulative model.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0144-3577			WOS:000298871000005		
J	Thodesen, Carl; Putman, Bradley; Amirkhanian, Serji; Bridges, William								Prediction of high-temperature asphalt binder properties based on Brookfield viscometer values								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PAVEMENT ENGINEERING				12	5			475	483		10.1080/10298430903308269			2011	2011	The objective of this research was to develop an empirical model which may be used to predict the performance grade (PG) of asphalt binders given only the viscosity of the binder at 135 degrees C. Data from two existing studies (5 binder sources and 10 crumb rubber variations) were utilised in the development of the model. The empirical models were evaluated using data obtained from a fractional factorial experimental design using five previously untested base binders; 19 crumb rubber modified binders were subsequently evaluated. The developed models for G*/sin delta, PG high failure temperature, crumb rubber concentration yielded good correlations with respective R-squared values of 0.89, 0.81 and 0.76 in the verification study. These findings confirm that it is possible to empirically model the high-temperature behaviour of modified asphalt binders using only the binder viscosity at 135 degrees C as a reference point.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1029-8436			WOS:000299700200003

Viscosity prediction of CRM binders using artificial neural network approach								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PAVEMENT ENGINEERING				12	5			485	495		10.1080/10298430903578903			2011	2011	The primary objective of this study was to develop a series of artificial neural network (ANN) models to predict the viscosity values of crumb rubber-modified (CRM) binders using four input variables: asphalt binder source, rubber size, mixing duration and rubber content. The results indicated that ANN-based models are effective in predicting the viscosity values of CRM binders regardless of rubber type and can easily be implemented in a spreadsheet. In addition, the developed ANN model can be used to predict viscosity values of other types of CRM binders. Furthermore, the results also show that asphalt binder source, rubber size and rubber content are the most important factors in the developed ANN models while the mixing duration is relatively unimportant. The sensitivity analysis of input variables indicated that the viscosity changes significantly with changes in asphalt binder source, rubber size and rubber content.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1029-8436			WOS:000299700200004

The utilisation of nanotechnology in civil engineering area is relatively new and its use and applications are expected to increase rapidly. The objective of this study was to investigate and evaluate the rheological properties of binders containing various percentages of carbon nanoparticles after a long-term ageing process. The experimental design for this study included the utilisations of five binder sources (three grades of PG 64-22, PG 64-16 and PG 52-28) and four nano percentages (0.0, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5% by weight of the virgin binder). The rheological characteristics of these pressurised aged vessel (PAV) binders were tested including G* value, creep and creep recovery, and frequency and amplitude sweep at an intermediate temperature and deflection, stiffness and m-value at a low temperature as well. The results of the experiments indicated that the addition of nanoparticles does not increase the G* values and does have an obvious effect on complex modulus, phase angle under a frequency sweep test. However, nanoparticles have a slight effect on creep angle and compliance of a binder. Moreover, at a low tested temperature, the experimental results indicate that the nanoparticles have no effect on deflection, stiffness and m-value of PAV residue. Furthermore, statistical analysis indicates that the asphalt binder source and grade rather than nanoparticles play a key role in determining the rheological properties									10	0	0	0	0	10			1029-8436			WOS:000299700600002

Rejection or resistance has rarely been hostile or violent; acceptance has often been marked by adaptation to local environment and culture. Latinos and Latin Americans have also had a reciprocal impact on North American sports as seen in the performance of individual athletes in the US, in the style of play in such sports as baseball and soccer, and in the practice of a few imported sports.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0952-3367			WOS:000299617800007

We accomplish this by first constructing a congruence between the Saito-Kurokawa lift of f and a non-CAP Siegel cusp form. Once this congruence is established, we use Galois representations to obtain the lower bound on the Selmer group.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1073-7928			WOS:000289313600010

A total of 203,221 ESTs and cDNA sequences from apple were downloaded, screened for vector, and separated into 9,228 from root and 193,993 non-root tissues. Each set of sequences was separately clustered (root: 1,868 contigs, 3247 singletons; non-root: 23,340 contigs, 10,668 singletons). Of those, 189 contigs and 955 singletons expressed in root tissue had no matches among the non-root sequences (Blast E-value > 1E-20). These sequences were annotated against SwissProt and the Genbank NR databases. Annotations were used as a basis for selection of 44 genes potentially involved in hormone and other developmental pathways. Unique PCR primers were designed and used to screen a BAC library of the commercial dwarfing apple rootstock 'Geneva 41'. Of these, 35 BAC clones were amplified, and 7 BAC clones polymorphic between parents of the mapping population 'Ottawa 3'. 'Robusta 5'. All seven regions were mapped onto nine linkage groups. These markers have been included into a larger map containing 551 markers total, which is being used to identify QTLs associated with tree architecture and disease resistance. Effort is being made to map monomorphic markers using novel allele discrimination techniques such as High Resolution Melting Curve analysis.					9th International Symposium on Integrating Canopy, Rootstock and Environmental Physiology in Orchard Systems9th International Symposium on Integrating Canopy, Rootstock and Environmental Physiology in Orchard Systems	AUG 04-08, 2008AUG 04-08, 2008	Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)	Geneva, NYGeneva, NY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-90-66052-97-0	WOS:000313512600005

Batsch] mutant evergrowing (evg) fails to cease growth and enter dormancy under dormancy inducing conditions. We used the evg mutant to filter gene expression associated with exposure to short days (SD) but not involved in the induction of dormancy itself. Peach wild-type and evg plants were grown under controlled conditions of long day (LD, 16h/8h) followed by eight weeks of SD (8h/16h). Growth cessation was evaluated and apical tissues were sampled at LD and one, two, four and eight weeks of SD. We identified and analyzed genes involved in vegetative growth cessation by PCR cDNA subtraction between the genotypes at each time point. Wild-type plants showed apical growth cessation after two weeks of SD. We found 19 differentially expressed genes in the wild-type with respect to the mutant associated with the development of dormancy. We used the quantitative real time PCR reaction to study the expression of the differentially expressed genes in wild-type tissues following the transition to short-day treatment. We observed two patterns of expression: early expression that decreased at time of growth cessation, and late expression that peaked at eight weeks of SD. In conclusion, the use of the dormancy-incapable mutant evg has allowed us to reduce the number of genes typically detected by differential display techniques on dormancy experiments. These genes will be the target of future investigation.					9th International Symposium on Integrating Canopy, Rootstock and Environmental Physiology in Orchard Systems9th International Symposium on Integrating Canopy, Rootstock and Environmental Physiology in Orchard Systems	AUG 04-08, 2008AUG 04-08, 2008	Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)	Geneva, NYGeneva, NY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-90-66052-97-0	WOS:000313512600010

One trial included 'Fuji' as the scion cultivar, and the other included 'McIntosh'. Rootstocks were CG.4013, CG.5179, Geneva (R) (G) 16N (liners from stoolbeds), G.16T (liners from stoolbeds derived from tissue cultured plants), G.41, G.202, M.9 NAKBT337, M.26 EMLA, Supporter 1, Supporter 2, and Supporter 3. The 'Fuji' trial was planted in Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania (Biglerville), with partial plantings in Pennsylvania (Rock Springs) and South Carolina. The 'McIntosh' trial was planted in Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nova Scotia, New York (Williamson), and Vermont, with partial plantings in New York (Peru), Ontario, and Pennsylvania (Rock Springs). Trees were spaced 3x5m and trained as vertical axes. At the end of nine growing seasons (2007), trees on Supporter 1, 2, and 3 were similar in size to those on M.9 NAKBT337. Trees on G.41 were similar in size to those on M.9 NAKBT337 for 'Fuji' and to those on G.16 for 'McIntosh.' 'Fuji' trees on G.16, G.202, CG.5179 were similar to those on M. 26 EMLA, and 'McIntosh' trees on G.202 were larger than those on M. 26 EMLA, with those on G.16 smaller. Trees on CG.4013 were the largest in both trials. Cumulatively (2001-07) for both cultivars, the greatest yields were from trees on CG.4013. The lowest 'Fuji' yields were from trees on M. 9 NAKBT337, Supporter 1, and Supporter 2. For 'McIntosh,' lowest cumulative yields were from trees on M. 9 NAKBT337, G.16T, and Supporter 1. Cumulatively (2001-07), trees on Supporter 1, G.41, and M. 9 NAKBT337 were among the most yield efficient, and those on CG.4013, M.26 EMLA, and G.202 were among the least yield efficient for both cultivars.

One trial included 'Fuji' as the scion cultivar, and the other included 'McIntosh'. Rootstocks were CG.4814, CG.7707, Geneva (R) (G) 30N (liners from stool beds), M.7 EMLA, M.26 EMLA, and Supporter 4. The 'Fuji' trial was planted in Kentucky, Missouri, and North Carolina, with a partial planting in South Carolina. The 'McIntosh' trial was planted in Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nova Scotia, New York (Williamson), and Ontario, with partial plantings in New York (Peru), Pennsylvania (Rock Springs), and Vermont. Trees were spaced 4x6 m and trained as free-standing central leaders. 'Fuji' trees on M.7 EMLA had larger trunk cross-sectional area in 2007 than those on Supporter 4. 'McIntosh' trees on M.7 EMLA and Supporter 4 were larger than those on M.26 EMLA, CG.4814, or CG.7707. Root suckering (cumulative, 1999-2007) was much more prominent with 'Fuji' as the scion cultivar than with 'McIntosh'. M.7 EMLA resulted in the most root suckering with both scion cultivars, and M.26 EMLA resulted in the least. Cumulatively (2001-07), 'Fuji' trees on G.30N yielded more than those on M.26 EMLA, CG.4814, M.7 EMLA, or Supporter 4. 'McIntosh' trees on G.30N, Supporter 4, M.7 EMLA, and CG.4814 yielded more than those on M.26 EMLA. Cumulatively (2001-07), 'Fuji' trees on G.30N and Supporter 4 were more yield efficient than those on M.7 EMLA. For 'McIntosh', however, trees on CG.4814 were more yield efficient than all others, and trees on G.30N and CG.7707 were more efficient than those on M.7 EMLA.

This test planting was a NC-140 Cooperative Regional Rootstock Project (www.nc140.org). There were 14 rootstocks, which included three peach seedling rootstocks: 'Lovell', 'Bailey', and Guardian (R) 'BY520-9' [selection SC-17] and 11 clonal rootstocks. Clonal rootstocks included peach x almond hybrids 'BH-4' and 'SLAP' ('Cornerstone'); peach x plum hybrids 'K146-43' ('Controller 5'), 'K146-44', and 'P30-135' ('Controller 9'); interspecific plum hybrids 'Hiawatha', 'Jaspi' and 'Julior'; interspecific Prunus hybrids 'Cadaman (R)' and 'VVA-1' (Krymsk (R) 1); and Prunus pumila selection 'Pumiselect (R)'. The largest trees were from Georgia, Maryland, and South Carolina. 'BH-4', 'SLAP', SC-17, Lovell, and 'Cadaman (R)' were the most vigorous rootstocks. 'Jaspi', 'K146-43', 'K146-44' and 'VVA-1' were the least vigorous, having trunk circumferences 30-40% smaller than Lovell. No rootstock had a significantly higher survival rate than Lovell at all locations. 'Julior', 'Jaspi', and 'VVA-1' had significantly more root suckers. Cumulative fruit yields were highest on the peach seedling, peach x almond, and 'Cadaman (R)' rootstocks. Lowest cumulative yields were from trees on 'Jaspi', 'VVA-1', and 'K146-44' rootstocks.

Robinson, TL		Guardian (R) Peach Rootstock Performance and Preplant Soil Fumigation Effects in a Fallow Site								IX INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON INTEGRATING CANOPY, ROOTSTOCK AND ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY IN ORCHARD SYSTEMS		Acta Horticulturae		903				469	473					2011	2011	Performance of the peach rootstock Guardian (R),'BY520-9' was compared to Lovell in a North Carolina site, with and without preplant fumigation. Guardian (R) is reported to be tolerant to both root-knot and ring nematodes, with ring nematodes contributing to the incidence of peach tree short life (PTSL). The use of Guardian (R) rootstock and preplant soil fumigation in PTSL prone sites are recommended practices for peach production. In this study we investigated the effect of soil fumigation and Guardian (R) on a site with no history of PTSL. The study site had been fallow for more than five years after a peach orchard was removed with good tree survival. Lovell was used as the industry standard and five selections that are components of commercially sold bulked Guardian (R) seed were used. One half of each replicate was preplant fumigated with Telone II (1,3-Dichloropropene, 281 L/treated ha) with a 3.7 m strip centered on the tree row. Four peach cultivars, developed in North Carolina, were used in this study and included 'Challenger', 'Intrepid', 'Contender' and 'China Pearl'. Each cultivar was a fully replicated trial and the four trials were adjacent to one another. For all cultivars, survival in the initial seven years was greatest for the trees grown on Guardian (R) compared to those on Lovell. Survival for trees on Lovell ranged between 15-58% and 73-96% for trees on Guardian (R) across the fumigated treatment. No differences in trunk cross-sectional area (TCSA) or yield per tree were detected on the surviving trees when comparing Lovell and Guardian (R) trees. Due to large differences in tree survival between Guardian (R) and Lovell, yield/ha differences were considerable. Fumigation effects in the initial years across cultivars were less pronounced. TCSA and cumulative yield per tree, using the surviving trees, were numerically greatest for trees grown on fumigated soil compared to those grown in non-fumigated soil although the differences were not significant in the initial seven years.					9th International Symposium on Integrating Canopy, Rootstock and Environmental Physiology in Orchard Systems9th International Symposium on Integrating Canopy, Rootstock and Environmental Physiology in Orchard Systems	AUG 04-08, 2008AUG 04-08, 2008	Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)	Geneva, NYGeneva, NY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-90-66052-97-0	WOS:000313512600064

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of interstems and grafting heights on the vegetative growth of young 'Redhaven' peach trees grown near Clemson, South Carolina, and to determine if a dwarfing mechanism independent of the root system was involved. In October 2005, 'Redhaven' peach was chip budded on Lovell seedling rootstock, Pumiselect (R) and Krymsk (R) 1 clonal rootstocks, and Pumiselect (R)/Lovell and Krymsk (R) 1/Lovell interstem trees. In another experiment, Lovell, Pumiselect (R) and Krymsk (R) 1 rootstocks were budded with 'Redhaven' at 5, 25 and 45 cm from the ground. Trunk cross-sectional area (TCA), number of shoot tip growing points, tree height, fresh and dry weight, and midday stem water potential were evaluated during the period 2006-2007. Pumiselect (R) and Krymsk (R) 1 interstem trees were 81 and 88%, respectively, the size of trees grafted on Lovell at the end of the first year, while Krymsk (R) 1 interstem trees were almost 50% smaller than those trees on Lovell at the end of the second year. Height and fresh and dry weight of whole trees were also reduced by interstems, compared to Lovell. In the second experiment, graft height did not affect the vegetative parameters of 'Redhaven' trees. Differences in growth were due to rootstocks where trees on Krymsk (R) 1 were significantly smaller than both Lovell and Pumiselect (R) independent of grafting height. Midday stem water potential reduction followed a similar pattern observed in most of the measured growth parameters. Interstem genotype but not grafting height affected the size of 'Redhaven' trees in the studied combinations. These data suggest the dwarfing mechanism in some Prunus rootstocks involves both the root system and other plant tissues.					9th International Symposium on Integrating Canopy, Rootstock and Environmental Physiology in Orchard Systems9th International Symposium on Integrating Canopy, Rootstock and Environmental Physiology in Orchard Systems	AUG 04-08, 2008AUG 04-08, 2008	Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)	Geneva, NYGeneva, NY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-90-66052-97-0	WOS:000313512600071

Robinson, TL		Dormant Carbohydrate Reserves of Two Peach Cultivars Grafted on Different Vigor Rootstocks								IX INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON INTEGRATING CANOPY, ROOTSTOCK AND ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY IN ORCHARD SYSTEMS		Acta Horticulturae		903				815	820					2011	2011	In temperate fruit trees, early spring shoot growth depends on carbohydrate reserves accumulated in the previous season. Vigorous rootstocks can accumulate more reserves, which contribute to a higher initial flush of shoot growth. Total dormant, non-structural carbohydrates (TNC) in above and below ground tissues were studied in mature 4-year-old 'Redhaven' and 5-year-old 'Redtop' peach trees at three different locations (California, Georgia and South Carolina), and in 1-year-old 'Redhaven' trees grown near Clemson, South Carolina. The rootstocks included Lovell (Prunus persica), Pumiselect (R) (P. pumila), Krymsk (R) 1 (P. tomentosa x P. cerasifera), Cadaman (R)-Avimag (P. persica x P. davidiana), Controller (R) 5 (P. salicina x P. persica) and Cornerstone (P. persica x P. dulcis). Shoot and root samples were taken for tissue analysis from the mature trees concurrently when the 1-year-old peach trees were removed from the ground. Carbohydrates were also quantified in bark and wood tissues in the mature 'Redtop' trees. Greater concentrations of TNC were found in roots of 'Redhaven' and 'Redtop' trees in California compared to the other two sites; however, shoot TNC did not differ significantly among sites. Concentration of TNC in roots was at least two-fold more than in shoots. Lovell roots had the greatest accumulation of reserves and Krymsk (R) 1 the lowest. Rootstock bark accumulated the largest amount of TNC, followed by scion bark, and Lovell had the greatest TNC content. One-year-old 'Redhaven' trees had the highest TNC accumulation in Lovell roots. About 70% of TNC were accumulated in root tissues, and smaller roots accounted for most of the carbohydrates (>80%). The more vigorous rootstocks, in this case Lovell, not only had the greatest accumulation of dormant carbohydrates, but also had the greatest root and shoot dry weights per tree, suggesting that the initial differences in spring shoot growth could be attributed to both.					9th International Symposium on Integrating Canopy, Rootstock and Environmental Physiology in Orchard Systems9th International Symposium on Integrating Canopy, Rootstock and Environmental Physiology in Orchard Systems	AUG 04-08, 2008AUG 04-08, 2008	Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)	Geneva, NYGeneva, NY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-90-66052-97-0	WOS:000313512600113

Robinson, TL		Peach Flower Buds Thinned with Dormant Applications of Vegetoil (R) Adjuvant Plus Ethephon								IX INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON INTEGRATING CANOPY, ROOTSTOCK AND ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY IN ORCHARD SYSTEMS		Acta Horticulturae		903				827	832					2011	2011	Early removal of flower buds, flowers or small fruitlets increases peach fruit size and value at harvest. Due to the scarcity of labeled or consistent thinning chemicals, peach growers generally wait similar to 30 days after full bloom before hand-thinning fruit, which limits potential fruit size. Experiments were conducted near Clemson, South Carolina to determine the efficacy of combining Vegetoil (R) (VO), an emulsified soybean oil adjuvant (93% soybean oil), with Ethephon (Ethrel (R) a.i. 21.7%) for pre-bloom flower bud thinning of peach cultivars. 'Contender', 'Cresthaven' and 'Rubyprince' peach were sprayed in January 2006, 2007 and 2008 with 10% VO except for 'Rubyprince' in 2006 (8% VO). Ethephon concentrations used varied by year and were 25, 50, 75, 100, or 150 ppm. Dormant oil (DO) at 3% and VO at 10% were the control treatments in 2006+2008 and 2007 respectively. VO (10%) plus Ethephon at 100 and/or 150 ppm significantly delayed bloom in 'Contender' and 'Cresthaven' in 2006 and in 'Cresthaven' and 'Rubyprince' in 2007. In 2006 and 2008, VO (10%) significantly reduced the number of flower buds alive at bloom for 'Contender', 'Cresthaven', and Rubyprince (only 2008), and the addition of Ethephon to the VO spray significantly increased flower bud mortality when compared to the 10% VO application. There were no differences among the 'Rubyprince' treatments in 2006, but the addition of ethephon slightly increased flower bud death in 2007 and significantly more in 2008. Basal flower buds on marked shoots had significantly lower survival than the distal or terminal flower buds in the VO treatments in all years and all cultivars except 'Cresthaven' in 2006. Generally, 'Rubyprince' is easier to flower bud thin with soybean oil than 'Cresthaven', but the opposite was observed in this study when using the Vegetoil (R) soybean oil product.					9th International Symposium on Integrating Canopy, Rootstock and Environmental Physiology in Orchard Systems9th International Symposium on Integrating Canopy, Rootstock and Environmental Physiology in Orchard Systems	AUG 04-08, 2008AUG 04-08, 2008	Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)	Geneva, NYGeneva, NY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-90-66052-97-0	WOS:000313512600115

Batsch] rootstock trial from the multi-site NC-140 Regional Rootstock Research Project. Sampling was carried out on a subset of five replicate trees of five rootstocks, representing a wide range of tree sizes. Root distribution was determined by collecting nine soil cores in a radial array around a randomly selected quarter section of each tree trunk. Tree roots were separated from the soil, assigned to one of three size classes, dried at 70 degrees C and weighed. Dry weights were analyzed by standard analysis of variance to determine main effects and interactions of rootstock, sampling depth and location. Total root biomass distribution differed among rootstocks, location around the tree and depth in the soil profile. This soil core sampling approach provided an efficient method for comparing distribution of large and fine roots among rootstocks.					9th International Symposium on Integrating Canopy, Rootstock and Environmental Physiology in Orchard Systems9th International Symposium on Integrating Canopy, Rootstock and Environmental Physiology in Orchard Systems	AUG 04-08, 2008AUG 04-08, 2008	Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)	Geneva, NYGeneva, NY	0	0	0	0	0	0			0567-7572		978-90-66052-97-0	WOS:000313512600133

Robinson, TL		Weather Conditions Affect Fruit Weight, Harvest Date and Soluble Solids Content of 'Cresthaven' Peaches								IX INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON INTEGRATING CANOPY, ROOTSTOCK AND ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY IN ORCHARD SYSTEMS		Acta Horticulturae		903				1063	1068					2011	2011	In spring 2002, 'Cresthaven' peach trees on Lovell rootstock were planted in six locations in the states of California, Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York and South Carolina. All trees came from the same nursery. During the three seasons of 2004 to 2006, five healthy trees were selected at each site and thinned heavily and early to obtain maximum fruit size. Fruit were first harvested when a few began to soften and all remaining fruit were harvested within one week. Defective, green or abnormally small fruit were thrown out. Fruit were individually weighed and a wedge was taken from each to obtain a composite percent soluble solids content (SSC) reading for each tree. Other data collected included bloom date, daily solar radiation, max/min temperatures and rainfall. Of the 16 location/year combinations (New York was frozen out two years), there was substantial variation in all parameters measured. For example average fruit weight (FrtWt) ranged from 131 to 394 grams, SSC from 10.2 to 15.1%, bloom dates from March 7 to May 2 and time from bloom to harvest (Bl-Hrv) varied from 109 to 143 days. Correlation analysis was conducted to identify weather parameters that could account for the variability in FrtWt, Bl-Hrv and SSC. First, FrtWt and Bl-Hrv were well correlated (positively) with each other (r = 0.86) and thus their correlations with weather parameters were similar. In general, large FrtWt (and longer Bl-Hrv) was associated with cooler temperatures and lower solar radiation in the spring. Greater SSC was associated with a lack of rain before harvest and lower minimum temperatures during the season.					9th International Symposium on Integrating Canopy, Rootstock and Environmental Physiology in Orchard Systems9th International Symposium on Integrating Canopy, Rootstock and Environmental Physiology in Orchard Systems	AUG 04-08, 2008AUG 04-08, 2008	Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)	Geneva, NYGeneva, NY	2	0	0	2	0	2			0567-7572		978-90-66052-97-0	WOS:000313512600148

Additionally, peach trees require extensive pruning to maintain productivity in the orchard. Inoculation with graft-transmissible agents has been shown to both delay spring bloom and reduce summer pruning requirement. Virus-indexed trees of the peach cultivar 'Springprince' grafted to Guardian (R) rootstock were inoculated in March 2005 with chip buds to initiate 6 treatments involving virus or virus-like agents both singly and in mixtures. These consisted of Apple chlorotic leafspot virus (ACLSV), an unknown high-chill peach cultivar (acronym 'PK'), the peach cultivar 'Ta Tao 5,' ACLSV & Peach latent mosaic viroid (PLMVd), 'PK' & ACLSV, and ACLSV & PLMVd & Cherry green ring mottle virus (CGRMV). Establishment of treatments was verified by ELISA, dot-blot hybridization, and PCR. Numerous growth characteristics and harvest data were recorded from Summer 2005 through Summer 2008. Bloom delay and pruning reduction were successfully accomplished through the use of graft-transmissible agents. These agents may offer protection against damaging spring frosts, extend the harvest season for peach cultivars and reduce labor requirements in commercial orchards. Modification of peach phenology with graft-transmissible agents bridges the gap between natural and technological innovation.					9th International Symposium on Integrating Canopy, Rootstock and Environmental Physiology in Orchard Systems9th International Symposium on Integrating Canopy, Rootstock and Environmental Physiology in Orchard Systems	AUG 04-08, 2008AUG 04-08, 2008	Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)	Geneva, NYGeneva, NY	1	0	0	1	0	1			0567-7572		978-90-66052-97-0	WOS:000313512600161

Self-rated Health in Relation to Rape and Mental Health Disorders in a National Sample of College Women								JOURNAL OF AMERICAN COLLEGE HEALTH				59	7			588	594		10.1080/07448481.2010.520175			2011	2011	Objective: The purpose of this study was to employ a multivariate approach to examine the correlates of self-rated health in a college sample of women, with particular emphasis on sexual assault history and related mental health outcomes. Participants: A national sample of 2,000 female college students participated in a structured phone interview between January and June 2006. Methods: Interview modules assessed demographics, posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive episode, substance use, rape experiences, and physical health. Results: Logistic regression analyses showed that poor self-rated health was associated with low income (odds ratio [OR] = 2.70), lifetime posttraumatic stress disorder (OR = 2.47), lifetime major depressive episode (OR = 2.56), past year illicit drug use (OR = 2.48), and multiple rape history (OR = 2.25). Conclusions: These findings highlight the need for university mental health and medical service providers to assess for rape history, and to diagnose and treat related psychiatric problems in order to reduce physical morbidity.									12	0	0	0	0	12			0744-8481	1940-3208		WOS:000299478100003	21823953

The antimicrobial activity of quercetin was evaluated against 11 H. pylori strains in vitro with inhibition of all strains at 128-64 mu g ml-1. In vivo studies showed a moderate reduction in H. pylori counts following treatment with 5 and 10% MGS or quercetin (25 mg kg-1 body weight) in addition to significantly reduced inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta and IFN-gamma) when compared with untreated mice.Conclusions:MGS and quercetin did not significantly reduce H. pylori growth in a mouse model. However, these products were effective in regulating the inflammatory response to H. pylori infection.Significance and Impact of the Study:Our results suggest that H. pylori infection may be reduced or prevented via the consumption of fruits rich in certain phenolic compounds (e.g. quercetin) such as muscadine grapes.									4	0	0	3	0	6			1364-5072			WOS:000285207600015	20955190

Upon light illumination surface plasmon resonance was generated from the gold nanowire, which promoted quenching of the dendrimer fluorescence as a result of the energy transfer between the dendrimer and the copper ions. The monotonic dependence of the fluorescence quenching on copper concentration was exploited to reach a copper detection sensitivity of 2 nM. In addition, the fluorescence of the labeled dendrimers was quenched specifically by copper in a matrix of common metal ions. Using simulations we calculated the enhanced optical near field for a dendrimer-coated gold nanowire illuminated by a TM-polarized plane wave, which provided a physical basis for the sensitive copper detection using the current experimental scheme.

J	Roth, Philip L.; Buster, Maury A.; Bobko, Philip								Updating the Trainability Tests Literature on Black-White Subgroup Differences and Reconsidering Criterion-Related Validity								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY				96	1			34	45		10.1037/a0020923			JAN 2011	2011	A number of applied psychologists have suggested that trainability test Black White ethnic group differences are low or relatively low (e.g., Siegel & Bergman, 1975), though data are scarce. Likewise, there are relatively few estimates of criterion-related validity for trainability tests predicting job performance (cf. Robertson & Downs, 1989). We review and clarify the existing (and limited) literature on Black White group differences on trainability tests, provide new trainability test data from a recent video-based trainability exam, and present archival data about how trainability test scores relate to cognitive ability, Black White differences, and job performance. Consistent with hypotheses, our results suggest large correlations of trainability tests with cognitive ability (e.g.,.80) and larger standardized ethnic group differences than previously thought (ds of 0.86, 1.10, and 1.21 for 3 samples). Results also suggest that trainability tests have higher validity than previously thought. Overall, our analysis provides a substantial amount of data to update our understanding of the use of trainability tests in personnel selection.									5	0	0	0	1	6			0021-9010			WOS:000286482500003	20919795

Preparation and Characterization of a Composite of Demineralized Bone Matrix Fragments and Polylactide Beads for Bone Tissue Engineering								JOURNAL OF BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE-POLYMER EDITION				22	4-6			589	610		10.1163/092050610X488232			2011	2011	A composite that utilizes the osteoinductivity of demineralized bone matrix (DBM) and the attractive characteristics of polylactide (PL) may be useful as a tissue-engineered bone substitute. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential of a composite system consisting of DBM fragments and PL beads to support the attachment and proliferation of multipotent mouse marrow stromal cells and to provide a structure for the cells' differentiation into the osteoblast lineage. Furthermore, the overarching goal was to provide a preliminary assessment of the DBM/PL cultures in order to facilitate the development of injectable composite DBM/PL systems in the long term. Demineralized bone matrix fragments were produced from bovine femurs and polylactide beads were produced by a single emulsion process. Differential scanning calorimetry and gel-permeation chromatography were used to characterize the PL samples. Multipotent mouse marrow stromal cells were cultured on several different substrate mixtures including 100% DBM, 70% DBM: 30% PL, 50% DBM: 50% PL and 100% PL. Cells were analyzed using a LIVE/DEAD (R) Viability/Cytotoxicity kit as well as scanning electron microscopy. Lactic acid and glucose levels were measured throughout the study. Osteogenic differentiation of the MSCs was assessed with an alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) assay and RT-PCR for expression of bone sialoprotein, osteocalcin and runt-related transcription factor 2. All cell types attached more readily to DBM fragments than PL beads resulting in more lactic acid production in the samples containing mostly DBM. The ALP activity and gene expression results indicate that the optimal mixture for the D1 line of multipotent mouse marrow stromal cells differentiation into osteoblasts is 100% PL. However, it is likely that the decreased pH in the DBM containing samples resulted in an environment that was not very conducive for osteogenic differentiation.

Effect of Osteoclast Co-culture on the Differentiation of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells Grown on Bone Graft Granules								JOURNAL OF BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE-POLYMER EDITION				22	4-6			789	808		10.1163/092050610X496260			2011	2011	Traditional approaches to bone repair are currently being integrated with innovative tissue-engineering techniques, as researchers and clinicians shift their treatment focus toward regenerating functional tissue rather than just filling a defect to provide structural support. Cells are expanded and incorporated into implantable systems in hopes of enhancing the bone-forming capabilities of traditional bone graft substitutes. The present study examined how osteoclasts might be used to stimulate the differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) into bone forming cells. The two cell types were co-cultured on a resorbable, three-dimensional bone graft substitute. Osteoclasts were seeded prior to the addition of hMSCs, as well as simultaneously, to determine if resorption of the scaffold would have any bearing on observed response by hMSCs. When seeded directly with hMSCs on the 3-D substrates, the osteoclasts had an increase in TRAP expression over time if seeded simultaneously. The co-culture setup had a positive influence on the proliferation of hMSCs. Late stage osteoblast differentiation markers (bone sialoprotein) were positively affected by direct co-culture with osteoclasts. The addition of RANKL to the culture medium for osteoclastogenesis appears to be a factor in the observed responses by hMSCS, but is not the only factor influencing the MSCs. Osteoclasts were shown to have an influence on the development of mesenchymal stem cells into osteoblasts when cultured in vitro. Findings from this study, coupled with the knowledge obtained from our previous work, will aid in the development of a clinically viable mesenchymal stem cell based bone graft system.

In this paper, we report on development of a new technique for materials characterization. We propose to conduct wicking and permeability experiments for full characterization of the nanowebs. As an example, we used electrospun cellulose acetate nanowebs. The wicking experiments showed very good reproducibility, demonstrating the square-root-of-time dependence of wetting front position vs time. The prefactor depends on a product of capillary pressure and materials permeability. We developed a technique to independently measure the permeability of small samples of nanowebs. Wicking and permeability data allow one to estimate the pore size; SEM micrographs confirmed the obtained estimates of pore radius. In general, the proposed method allows one to characterize the transport and absorption parameters of the nanofibrous materials for which the standard procedures are inapplicable.

Holstein cows (n = 1,380) were assigned randomly to be fed either CS of palm oil (PO) or safflower oil (SO) from 30 d prepartum until 30 d postpartum (dpp) and further randomized to receive either CS of PO or fish oil (FO) from 30 to 160 dpp. Supplementation of CS of FA was at 1.5% of dietary dry matter. Tissues (n = 23) and blood (n = 32) were collected from a subsample of cows. Blood was collected daily from parturition to 10 dpp and three times weekly thereafter until 30 dpp for analyses of PGF(2 alpha) metabolite, nonesterified FA, beta-hydroxybutyric acid, blood urea nitrogen, and glucose. Cows were evaluated once between 8 to 10 dpp for cervical discharge type. At 43 dpp, cows received 2 injections of PGF(2 alpha) 14 d apart, followed 14 d later by injections of GnRH at 7 d before and 56 h after an injection of PGF(2 alpha) with AT at 16 h after the second GnRH injection. All cows received intravaginally a controlled internal drug-releasing device, containing 1.38 g of progesterone, at 18 d after the first AI followed 7 d later by removal of the device and injection of GnRH. Nonpregnant cows at 32 d after AT were injected with PGF(2 alpha) followed 56 h later with a GnRH injection and second AT 16 h thereafter. Cows diagnosed pregnant after both AI were re-examined at 60 d of pregnancy to determine pregnancy losses. Milk weights were recorded monthly for all cows. Caruncular n-6:n-3 FA ratio was greater in cows fed SO. Plasma concentrations of metabolites and frequency of cervical discharge type did not differ between PO- and SO-fed cows. Plasma PGF(2 alpha) metabolite was greater in SO-fed cows at 4 and 7 dpp. Pregnancy per AT at 32 and 60 d post first AI was not affected by diets, but pregnancy loss was less in FO-fed cows. At second AI, pregnancy was greater in FO-fed cows at 32 d and in SO-FO-fed cows at 60 d post AI. Pregnancy loss after second AT was not affected by diets. Overall pregnancy per AT was greater in cows fed SO followed by FO at 60 d of pregnancy and pregnancy loss was reduced in FO-fed cows. Monthly milk yield was greater (0.7 kg/d) in SO-fed cows. In conclusion, strategic feeding of CS of FA during transition and breeding periods can benefit fertility and milk production of lactating dairy cows.									29	2	0	23	2	32			0022-0302			WOS:000285447400020	21183030

The results indicate that only the COMPS group significantly improved, from pretests to posttests, their performance on the criterion test (that involves equal groups and multiplicative compare problems) and the prealgebra model expression test. The study results suggest that elementary students with LP can be expected to move beyond concrete operations and to algebraically represent mathematical relations in conceptual models that drive the solution plan for accurate problem solving.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0022-0671			WOS:000300002800001

Present graph-based function structures rely on controlled vocabularies of verbs and nouns to model functions and flows. Currently, all vocabularies define these terms in plain text, allowing inconsistent interpretation and term usage in models, thus making the models unsuitable for formal computational reasoning. To address this limitation, two types of model-level consistencies topological and conservational - are identified through model examination as critical requirements for physics-based reasoning. A protocol is then demonstrated to evolve three verbs - Branch, Distribute, and Convert_Energy - from their textual definitions into formal classes that include the necessary information elements to support this reasoning. These verbs are used to construct function models, which are then used to simulate reasoning by computer algorithms, thus validating that the definitions indeed support conservation-based model checks at the conceptual level.									12	1	0	0	0	13			0954-4828			WOS:000297979800003

We have explored the use of alpha-D-mannose receptors as capturing agents for the detection of Escherichia coli using a microcantilever and have demonstrated that E. coli ORN178, which expresses normal type-1 pili, can interact with microcantilevers functionalized with alpha-D-mannose and can cause shifts in its resonance frequencies. Although E. coli ORN208, which expresses abnormal pili, binds poorly to alpha-D-mannose on the nitrocellulose membrane of a FAST slide, it did cause a detectable shift in resonance frequency when interacting with the alpha-D-mannose functionalized microcantilevers.

While cellular-based communication through commercial carriers is widely used for online traffic management applications, public agencies have also begun to consider other technologies, such as WiFi and WiMAX. Most such agencies still seek additional guidelines for the selection of suitable wireless options for different traffic control and management applications under different physical and environmental conditions. Performance and reliability are among the most important parameters to be considered when examining wireless communication options for traffic control and management applications. The authors first conducted interviews with selected traffic agencies regarding their experiences with performance of wireless communication infrastructure, as well as their interests and plans on future expansion. Next, they conducted a thorough literature review focusing on various wireless technologies that could be used in an intelligent transportation system environment. Last, the authors conducted a case study in which a section of the South Carolina Department of Transportation traffic camera system was wirelessly connected via either WiFi or WiMAX network architecture. This case study followed the proposed network design process presented in the article using WiFi and WiMAX technologies to support a traffic surveillance system that considered coverage range and two different network topologies: mesh/ad hoc (devices forward data to neighboring devices to reach the destination) and infrastructure (devices send data to an access point directly). The network simulator ns-2 was used to assess the average throughput that each camera can receive in different network topologies. Throughput/cost analysis of WiFi and WiMAX mesh and infrastructure topologies indicated that for given number of devices, a mesh network has better throughput for every dollar spent than infrastructure based topology. This article provides a foundation for further investigation of WiFi and WiMAX performance and reliability under different network topologies. Findings from this research will benefit transportation agencies and other stakeholders in evaluating and selecting wireless communication options and network topologies for various traffic control and management applications.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1547-2450			WOS:000299615900003

Assessing Cumulative Evidence within 'Macro' Research: Why Meta-Analysis Should be Preferred Over Vote Counting								JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES				48	1			178	197		10.1111/j.1467-6486.2009.00899.x			JAN 2011	2011	P>Understanding the conclusions a body of evidence offers involves accumulating findings. Two recent articles used vote counting to assess the evidence related to important macro theories: transaction cost theory and resource-based theory. Each concluded that its focal theory is not well supported. In contrast, recent meta-analyses of the same theories concluded that both are strongly supported. We explain why macro researchers should trust the findings of meta-analyses but not those of vote counts. A direct implication is that researchers interested in advancing transaction cost and resource-based theories need to build upon the meta-analytic evidence. A broader implication is that, as the preferred method for accumulating evidence, meta-analysis can be a catalyst for the re-evaluation of established theories and the development of new theory.									25	0	0	2	0	25			0022-2380			WOS:000284775100008

Nanoparticles of CaF2 : Eu, BaF2 : Ce, and LaF3 : Eu were produced by precipitation methods using ammonium di-n-octadecyldithiophosphate (ADDP) as a ligand that controls growth and lessens agglomeration. The structure and morphology were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy, while the scintillation properties of the nanoparticles were determined by means of X-ray and 241Am irradiation. The unique aspect of scintillation of nanoparticles is related to the migration of carriers in the nanoscintillator. Our results showed that even nanoparticles as small as similar to 4nm in size effectively scintillate, despite the diffusion length of e-h pairs being considerably larger than the nanoparticles themselves, and suggest that nanoparticles can be used for radiation detection.									19	0	0	0	0	19			1687-4110	1687-4129		WOS:000285590700001		
J	Shim, Jang Bo; Chang, Hyuk; Kim, Sung-O								Rapid Hydrothermal Synthesis of Zinc Oxide Nanowires by Annealing Methods on Seed Layers								JOURNAL OF NANOMATERIALS										582764	10.1155/2011/582764			2011	2011	Well-aligned zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowire arrays were successfully synthesized on a glass substrate using the rapid microwave heating process. The ZnO seed layers were produced by spinning the precursor solutions onto the substrate. Among coatings, the ZnO seed layers were annealed at 100 degrees C for 5 minutes to ensure particle adhesion to the glass surface in air, nitrogen, and vacuum atmospheres. The annealing treatment of the ZnO seed layer was most important for achieving the high quality of ZnO nanowire arrays as ZnO seed nanoparticles of larger than 30 nm in diameter evolve into ZnO nanowire arrays. Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed a single-crystalline lattice of the ZnO nanowires. Because of their low power (140 W), low operating temperatures (90 degrees C), easy fabrication (variable microwave sintering system), and low cost (90% cost reduction compared with gas condensation methods), high quality ZnO nanowires created with the rapid microwave heating process show great promise for use in flexible solar cells and flexible display devices.									8	0	0	0	0	8			1687-4110			WOS:000292402400001		
J	Fu, Song; Xu, Cheng-Zhong; Shen, Haiying								Randomized load balancing strategies with churn resilience in peer-to-peer networks								JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS				34	1			252	261		10.1016/j.jnca.2010.07.011			JAN 2011	2011	The objective of load balancing in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks is to balance the workload of peer nodes in proportion to their capacity so as to eliminate performance bottlenecks. It is challenging because of the dynamic nature in overlay networks, the time-varying load characteristics, and the inherent load imbalance caused by consistent hashing functions. It is known that simple randomized load balancing schemes can balance load effectively while incurring only a small overhead in general parallel and distributed computing contexts. Existing theoretical works which analyze properties of randomized load balancing schemes cannot be applied in the highly dynamic and heterogeneous P2P systems. In this paper, we characterize the behaviors of randomized load balancing schemes in a general P2P environment. We extend the supermarket model by investigating the impact of node heterogeneity and chum on load distribution in P2P networks. We prove that by using d-way random choices schemes, the length of the longest queue in a P2P system with heterogeneous nodes and chum for d >= 2 is c * log logn/logd + O(1) with high probability, where c is a constant. Our results have wide applicability and are of interest beyond the specific applications. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.									2	1	0	0	0	3			1084-8045			WOS:000285442200023

The objective of this research was to evaluate and compare three models (linear-plateau, quadratic-plateau, and quadratic) that can potentially be used to describe rice yield response to N fertilization. Fertilizer N response trials of four newly released rice cultivars from seven sites located in both Mississippi and Louisiana over a two-year period were used. Similar R-2 values indicated that each model fit the data equally well. The linear-plateau model had a tendency to produce lower estimates of the economical optimum N rate (EONR) while providing high estimates of yield at the EONR which, in turn, produced higher economic returns compared with other models. All models were equally stable with respect to input and output cost changes. The model used to predict EONR and economic estimates should be considered when evaluating published planning budgets supplied by economists to producers.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0190-4167			WOS:000297935700007		
J	Fries, Ryan N.; Dunning, Anne E.; Chowdhury, Mashrur A.								University Traveler Value of Potential Real-Time Transit Information								JOURNAL OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION				14	2			29	50					2011	2011	Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) have become common in public transit systems, particularly providing real-time transit information. For new implementations, it remains difficult to predict and quantify system and user benefits of technology implementation. Although previous studies have quantified the operational benefits of real-time transit traveler information systems, a gap in knowledge exists around passenger benefits of such systems. The objective of this research was to create a refined method for evaluating transit rider benefits from real-time traveler information and predict changes in traveler behavior. The study was conducted on a rural university campus, isolating the impacts of the system from the multiple influences that often affect transportation in larger metropolitan areas. This study uniquely integrated transit system performance, pedestrian travel times, and traffic simulation to determine travel times and predict mode split. Findings indicated that reducing passenger waiting anxiety was the most significant measure of traveler benefit from such a system. While the benefits found were specific to the study site, the methodology can be used for other transit systems evaluating real-time transit technology investments in rural or urban environments.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1077-291X			WOS:000297616500002

However, none of the research has reported on superconductivity (SC) in carrier-doped CNTs. Here, we report on SC with the world's highest transition temperature (T (c)) of 12 K in highly uniform thin films of boron-doped single-walled CNTs (B-SWNTs). We clarify correlation of SC with Fermi level tuning with van Hove singularities (VHS) in electronic density of states (DOS) in the SWNT. Moreover, we show fabrication of paper-like thin films consisting of a pseudo two-dimensional network of weakly coupled B-SWNTs (called the Buckypaper) and show an enhancement of the onset T (c) up to 19 K by applying only a small pressure. The present observations will shed light on the high feasibility of using CNTs as a 1D superconductor and also on the research of 1D electron correlation.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1557-1939			WOS:000289855700017

JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM				19	7			863	875		10.1080/09669582.2010.524703			2011	2011	This study explores current and potential collaboration efforts between land trusts (LTs) and tourism entities in the USA. LTs and tourism entities have convergent needs and goals regarding natural resource protection, possibly making them suitable partners. Sustainable tourism development needs natural resource protection; land trusts have proved economically viable and effective methods for protecting natural areas. While some case studies have described collaboration efforts by selected LTs and tourism entities, this mixed methods exploratory study is based upon survey data from 279 local and regional LTs operating across the USA. The study is grounded in both the Primary Environmental Care (PEC) conceptual model and Jafari's Background Tourism Elements concept, providing clarity on current and potential collaboration efforts between LTs and tourism entities. The survey showed that tourism-related characteristics, especially scenic qualities, were acceptable to land trusts, and that tourism was the most mentioned industry within LT areas. Only 39% of LTs currently work with tourism entities; however, only 4% of LTs report opposition from tourism entities to their conservation work. LT managers were strongly in favor of future collaboration with tourism interests. All five of the key components required for the PEC model were found.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0966-9582			WOS:000299287900004		
J	Xiao, Feipeng; Amirkhanian, Serji N.; Wu, Boli								Fatigue and Stiffness Evaluations of Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement in Hot Mix Asphalt Mixtures								JOURNAL OF TESTING AND EVALUATION				39	1			50	58		10.1520/JTE102699			JAN 2011	2011	The recycling of existing asphalt pavement materials produces new pavements with considerable savings in material, money, and energy. Understanding the ability of an asphalt pavement containing reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) to resist fracture from repeated loads is essential for the design of hot mix asphalt (HMA) mixtures. However, reaching a better understanding of fatigue behaviors of these pavements continues to challenge researchers all over the world, particularly, as recycled materials with more complex properties are being used in HMA pavements. This study explores the utilization of the conventional fatigue analysis approach in investigating the fatigue life of asphalt mixtures containing RAP. The fatigue beams were made with two asphalt binders, two aggregate sources, four RAP contents (0 %, 15 %, 25 %, and 30 %), and tested at 5 and 20 degrees C. A total of eight mixtures was evaluated and 64 fatigue beams were tested in this study. The test results indicated that the addition of RAP, as expected, increased the viscosity, G*sin delta, and creep stiffness values while reducing the m-values. However, no obvious trends were found for stiffness and fatigue life of mixtures as the RAP content increased. Statistical analysis results indicated that for binders and mixtures containing 30% RAP, the utilization of softer binder significantly decreased the viscosity, G*sin delta, and creep stiffness values; however, there were no significant differences in the stiffness and fatigue life values of these mixtures.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0090-3973	1945-7553		WOS:000296756900007

We show that the introduction of alkaline or alkaline earth in the glass network, drying of the batch with fluorine-based raw materials before melting, and melting of the glass in O-2-rich atmosphere can lead to a significant reduction in OH content. Employing these steps in TBZ glass processing resulted in a 93% reduction of OH content as compared with a reference composition. The reduction in OH content was verified by a decrease of the absorption band center at 3000 cm-1 as well as a decrease of the free volume in the glass. The addition of F in the glass network was found to reduce the fraction of nonbridging oxygen associated with OH. X-ray fluorescence spectrometry was used to determine the amount of remaining F.									36	1	0	0	1	37			0002-7820	1551-2916		WOS:000285972100011

J	Fowler, Matthew L; Ingram-Smith, Cheryl J; Smith, Kerry S								Direct detection of the acetate-forming activity of the enzyme acetate kinase.								Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE					58						10.3791/3474			2011 Dec 19	2011	Acetate kinase, a member of the acetate and sugar kinase-Hsp70-actin (ASKHA) enzyme superfamily, is responsible for the reversible phosphorylation of acetate to acetyl phosphate utilizing ATP as a substrate. Acetate kinases are ubiquitous in the Bacteria, found in one genus of Archaea, and are also present in microbes of the Eukarya. The most well characterized acetate kinase is that from the methane-producing archaeon Methanosarcina thermophila. An acetate kinase which can only utilize PP(i) but not ATP in the acetyl phosphate-forming direction has been isolated from Entamoeba histolytica, the causative agent of amoebic dysentery, and has thus far only been found in this genus. In the direction of acetyl phosphate formation, acetate kinase activity is typically measured using the hydroxamate assay, first described by Lipmann, a coupled assay in which conversion of ATP to ADP is coupled to oxidation of NADH to NAD(+) by the enzymes pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, or an assay measuring release of inorganic phosphate after reaction of the acetyl phosphate product with hydroxylamine. Activity in the opposite, acetate-forming direction is measured by coupling ATP formation from ADP to the reduction of NADP(+) to NADPH by the enzymes hexokinase and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Here we describe a method for the detection of acetate kinase activity in the direction of acetate formation that does not require coupling enzymes, but is instead based on direct determination of acetyl phosphate consumption. After the enzymatic reaction, remaining acetyl phosphate is converted to a ferric hydroxamate complex that can be measured spectrophotometrically, as for the hydroxamate assay. Thus, unlike the standard coupled assay for this direction that is dependent on the production of ATP from ADP, this direct assay can be used for acetate kinases that produce ATP or PP(i).									0	0	0	0	0	0				1940-087X		MEDLINE:22214984	22214984

What if no text is available, however, in the language of the learners? This case study describes the processes and techniques adopted by two university lecturers in Cambodia, as they translated an L1 (first language) science text into Khmer in a manner that tried to take full account of the cultural, linguistic, and social dimensions of language. Using a variety of translation techniques, they aimed to produce a Khmer text which would be most effective in promoting the learning of the new scientific terms required. Among the approaches used were the employment of English-Khmer word pairs, repetition throughout the text, and the incorporation of pictures where appropriate. The significance of this study is that it provides detailed and specific examples of how teachers and lecturers might respond to the challenges of translating scientific texts into languages that have not been extensively used as a medium of instruction at third level in recent times. It is hoped that it will also make some contribution to the larger effort to promote and restore native languages to their rightful place in education in post-colonial countries.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0790-8318			WOS:000299871200004

LEADERSHIP & ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT JOURNAL				32	1-2			5	19		10.1108/01437731111099256			2011	2011	Purpose - This study seeks to explore the relationship between corporate ethical values and person-organization fit (P-O fit) and the effects on organization commitment and job satisfaction. Further, it aims to examine the construct of moral intensity as a moderator of the P-O fit-commitment relationship as well as the P-O fit-job satisfaction relationship.Design/methodology/approach - Using a sample of 489 members of the National Purchasing Association in the USA, a structural model was examined in which it was hypothesized that corporate ethical values would be positively related to person-organization fit and P-O fit in turn would be positively related to commitment and job satisfaction. It was further hypothesized that the outcomes associated with P-O fit would be moderated by moral intensity such that high moral intensity would strengthen the P-O fit outcomes relationships.Findings - All of the hypotheses were supported.Research limitations/implications - All data stem from one data source, introducing the possibility of mono-source bias. Additionally, all scales use self-reports, introducing the possibility of mono-method bias.Practical implications - These results highlight the importance of corporate ethical values and moral intensity in building and maintaining an ethical and committed workforce.Originality/value - The findings of this study contribute to the ethics and P-O fit literature by establishing a link between corporate ethical values and P-O fit. It further construes moral intensity as a subjective variable based on the perceiver rather than an objective characteristic of ethical issues. Moral intensity was found to strengthen the relationships between P-O fit and satisfaction and P-O fit and commitment.									12	0	0	0	0	12			0143-7739			WOS:000208761500001

It follows that caterpillars having b back nodes, where b > 2 root Delta - 1 are not integral. We also show that among the regular caterpillars C(b,k) formed by adjoining k legs to each of b back nodes, all positive roots are in the interval (root k - 1, root k + 2), and C(b,k) is not integral if b > 2.

The influences of PCL concentration (3 and 5 g/100 mL), solvent in the oil phase (methylene chloride (DCM) and methylene chloride: acetonitrile = 50:50 (DCM:ACN)), and ultrasonification time (1, 2, and 3 min) were investigated. Encapsulation efficiency (%) was calculated by Duncan's multiple rage tests and it decreased from 87.73 to 57.45 when ultrasonification time was increased from 1 to 3 min. DCM as a solvent in the oil phase and 5 g/100 mL PCL showed better encapsulation efficiency than DCM:ACN and 3 g/100 mL PCL. Particle mean size was decreased when ultrasonification time was increased from 1 to 3 min. Nanoparticles with DCM as a solvent in the oil phase had larger particle mean size than the particle with DCM:ACN. There were no significant differences in particle mean size between two PCL concentrations. PCL with 3 g/100 mL concentration had higher alpha-tocopherol loading (%) than 5 g/100 mL PCL Overall, 5 g/100 mL PCL in DCM as solvent in the oil phase with 3 min ultrasonification time showed the best encapsulation formulation.

Continuum robots offer the potential of robust grasps over a wide variety of object classes, due to their ability to adapt their shape to interact with the environment via non-local continuum contact conditions. Furthermore, this capability can be achieved with simple, low degree of freedom hardware. However, there are practical issues which currently limit the application of continuum robots to grasping. We discuss these issues and illustrate via an experimental continuum grasping case study.									4	0	0	0	0	4			2191-9151	2191-916X		WOS:000208988000007

Preventing metal-mediated oxidative DNA damage with selenium compounds								METALLOMICS				3	5			503	512		10.1039/c0mt00063a			2011	2011	Copper and iron are two widely studied transition metals associated with hydroxyl radical ((center dot)OH) generation, oxidative damage, and disease development. Because antioxidants ameliorate metal-mediated DNA damage, DNA gel electrophoresis assays were used to quantify the ability of ten selenium-containing compounds to inhibit metal-mediated DNA damage by hydroxyl radical. In the Cu(I)/H(2)O(2) system, selenocystine, selenomethionine, and methyl-selenocysteine inhibit DNA damage with IC(50) values ranging from 3.34 to 25.1 mu M. Four selenium compounds also prevent DNA damage from Fe(II) and H(2)O(2). Additional gel electrophoresis experiments indicate that Cu(I) or Fe(II) coordination is responsible for the selenium antioxidant activity. Mass spectrometry studies show that a 1 : 1 stoichiometry is the most common for iron and copper complexes of the tested compounds, even if no antioxidant activity is observed, suggesting that metal coordination is necessary but not sufficient for selenium antioxidant activity. A majority of the selenium compounds are electroactive, regardless of antioxidant activity, and the glutathione peroxidase activities of the selenium compounds show no correlation to DNA damage inhibition. Thus, metal binding is a primary mechanism of selenium antioxidant activity, and both the chemical functionality of the selenium compound and the metal ion generating damaging hydroxyl radical significantly affect selenium antioxidant behavior.									26	1	0	16	0	27			1756-5901			WOS:000290227700006	21286651	
J	Winn, Brad; Quarles, C. Derrick, Jr.; Marcus, R.

In this study, we present a different approach to evaluate the biocompatibility of a metallic biomaterial. Our study is based on estimating what local concentrations of metallic ions are present at the site of implantation of an endovascular stent based on other studies in the literature. We then quantify the concentrations of metallic ions present in our conditioned media in which Nitinol wires were allowed to corrode, and compare cell response to ion concentrations in order to provide better experimental reproducibility. This is important to eliminate the variability of ion release rates from metals (even from the same lot) under similar conditions. Cell culture experiments using vascular smooth muscle cells exposed to clinically significant concentrations of nickel ions released from Nitinol showed two important responses. A decrease in cell aspect ratios showing a morphological change possibly indicating a shift towards a more synthetic phenotype was observed. Secondly, a decrease in alpha-actin expression was characterized by immunostaining with a fluorescent tag. At the highest concentration tested, average fluorescence decreased by approximately 26%, indicating a loss of the cellular contractile mechanism. However, the ion concentrations utilized in this study did not significantly affect cellular proliferation.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1756-5901			WOS:000294449100006	21766118

Kenneth								Metal retention in human transferrin: Consequences of solvent composition in analytical sample preparation methods								METALLOMICS				3	10			1027	1034		10.1039/c1mt00094b			2011	2011	The analysis of metal-binding proteins requires careful sample manipulation to ensure that the metal-protein complex remains in its native state and the metal retention is preserved during sample preparation or analysis. Chemical analysis for the metal content in proteins typically involves some type of liquid chromatography/electrophoresis separation step coupled with an atomic (i.e., inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy or -mass spectrometry) or molecular (i.e., electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry) analysis step that requires altered-solvent introduction techniques. UV-VIS absorbance is employed here to monitor the iron content in human holo-transferrin (Tf) under various solvent conditions, changing polarity, pH, ionic strength, and the ionic and hydrophobic environment of the protein. Iron loading percentages (i.e. 100% loading equates to 2 Fe3+ : 1 Tf) were quantitatively determined to evaluate the effect of solvent composition on the retention of Fe3+ in Tf. Maximum retention of Fe3+ was found in buffered (20 mM Tris) solutions (96 +/- 1%). Exposure to organic solvents and deionized H2O caused release of similar to 23-36% of the Fe3+ from the binding pocket(s) at physiological pH (7.4). Salt concentrations similar to separation conditions used for ion exchange had little to no effect on Fe3+ retention in holo-Tf. Unsurprisingly, changes in ionic strength caused by additions of guanidine HCl (0-10 M) to holo-Tf resulted in unfolding of the protein and loss of Fe3+ from Tf; however, denaturing and metal loss was found not to be an instantaneous process for additions of 1-5 M guanidinium to Tf. In contrast, complete denaturing and loss of Fe3+ was instantaneous with >= 6 M additions of guanidinium, and denaturing and loss of iron from Tf occurred in parallel proportions. Changes to the hydrophobicity of Tf (via addition of 0-14 M urea) had less effect on denaturing and release of Fe3+ from the Tf binding pocket compared to changes in ionic strength.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1756-5901			WOS:000295581700009	21904748

Stigma, Negative Attitudes About Treatment, and Utilization of Mental Health Care Among Soldiers								MILITARY PSYCHOLOGY				23	1			65	81		10.1080/08995605.2011.534415			2011	2011	Stigma and organizational barriers have been identified as factors for why a small proportion of soldiers with psychological problems seek professional help. In this article, we examine the impact of negative attitudes toward treatment on treatment seeking among soldiers previously deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq (n = 2,623). We asked soldiers with psychological problems questions about stigma, organizational barriers, negative attitudes toward treatment, and whether they sought treatment for their psychological problems. We found that negative attitudes about treatment inversely predicted treatment seeking. These results provide a more comprehensive examination of reasons that soldiers do not seek needed treatment and highlight the need for policy aimed at reducing negative attitudes toward mental health treatment.									85	0	0	14	0	85			0899-5605			WOS:000288378400006

During the course of sequencing plastid genomes from representative species from three rosid genera (Castanea, Prunus, Theobroma) and ongoing projects focusing on the Fagaceae and Passifloraceae, we identified putative losses of rpl22 in these two angiosperm families. We further characterized rpl22 from three species of Passiflora and one species of Quercus and identified sequences that likely represent pseudogenes. In Castanea and Quercus, both members of the Fagaceae, we identified a nuclear copy of rpl22, which consisted of two exons separated by an intron. Exon 1 encodes a transit peptide that likely targets the protein product back to the plastid and exon 2 encodes rpl22. We performed phylogenetic analyses of 97 taxa, including 93 angiosperms and four gymnosperm outgroups using alignments of 81 plastid genes to examine the phylogenetic distribution of rpl22 loss and transfer to the nucleus. Our results indicate that within rosids there have been independent transfers of rpl22 to the nucleus in Fabaceae and Fagaceae and a putative third transfer in Passiflora. The high level of sequence divergence between the transit peptides in Fabaceae and Fagaceae strongly suggest that these represent independent transfers. Furthermore, Blast searches did not identify the "donor" genes of the transit peptides, suggesting a de novo origin. We also performed phylogenetic analyses of rpl22 for 87 angiosperms and four gymnosperms, including nuclear-encoded copies for five species of Fabaceae and Fagaceae. The resulting trees indicated that the transfer of rpl22 to the nucleus does not predate the origin of angiosperms as suggested in an earlier study. Using previously published angiosperm divergence time estimates, we suggest that these transfers occurred approximately 56-58, 34-37, and 26-27 Ma for the Fabaceae, Fagaceae, and Passifloraceae, respectively.									42	7	0	43	0	48			0737-4038			WOS:000285418600078	20935065

Molecular biology international				2011				123702	123702		10.4061/2011/123702			2011	2011	Subspecies of the African trypanosome, Trypanosoma brucei, which cause human African trypanosomiasis, are transmitted by the tsetse fly, with transmission-essential lifecycle stages occurring in both the insect vector and human host. During infection of the human host, the parasite is limited to using glycolysis of host sugar for ATP production. This dependence on glucose breakdown presents a series of targets for potential therapeutic development, many of which have been explored and validated as therapeutic targets experimentally. These include enzymes directly involved in glucose metabolism (e.g., the trypanosome hexokinases), as well as cellular components required for development and maintenance of the essential subcellular compartments that house the major part of the pathway, the glycosomes.									0	0	0	0	0	0				2090-2190		MEDLINE:22091393	22091393

To implement high-speed scanning, the turning regions of the triangular waves were smoothed by a custom-designed waveform. The SHG and TPEF signals from samples were recorded by two PMTs in the forward and backward direction. Using this imaging system, we obtained 3D images of the sarcomere structure via SHG and DiO-stained lipid membrane via TPEF in live cardiomyocytes isolated from neonatal and adult rats. The results demonstrated the potential applications of SHG and TPEF in the research of myofibrillogensis.

Here we show that RADA16 SAPNSs form scaffolds of increasing fiber density with increasing peptide concentration which in turn has a concentration-dependent effect on neurons and astrocytes in mixed retinal cultures. Importantly, we report that the final nanoscale fiber architecture is an important factor to consider in designing scaffolds to promote regeneration in the central nervous system.									6	0	0	4	0	6			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000288218300013	21132164

These nanoparticles retain the fundamental spectroscopic properties of conjugated polymer nanoparticles prepared without PEG lipid, but demonstrate greater hydrophilicity and quantum yield compared to unmodified conjugated polymer nanoparticles. The sizes of these nanoparticles, as determined by TEM, were 21-26 nm. Notably, these nanoparticles were prepared with several PEG lipid functional end groups, including biotin and carboxy moieties that can be easily conjugated to biomolecules. We have demonstrated the availability of these end groups for functionalization using the interaction of biotin PEG lipid conjugated polymer nanoparticles with streptavidin. Biotinylated PEG lipid conjugated polymer nanoparticles bound streptavidin-linked magnetic beads, while carboxy and methoxy PEG lipid modified nanoparticles did not. Similarly, biotinylated PEG lipid conjugated polymer nanoparticles bound streptavidin-coated glass slides and could be visualized as diffraction-limited spots, while nanoparticles without PEG lipid or with non-biotin PEG lipid end groups were not bound. To demonstrate that nanoparticle functionalization could be used for targeted labelling of specific cellular proteins, biotinylated PEG lipid conjugated polymer nanoparticles were bound to biotinylated anti-CD16/32 antibodies on J774A.1 cell surface receptors, using streptavidin as a linker. This work represents the first demonstration of targeted delivery of conjugated polymer nanoparticles and demonstrates the utility of these new nanoparticles for fluorescence based imaging and sensing.									34	1	0	8	0	35			2040-3364	2040-3372		WOS:000288218300039	21152603

Apparently, the carbon particle surface passivation in carbon dots is critical to their fluorescence performance. An effective way to improve the surface passivation is to dope the surface of the precursor carbon nanoparticles with an inorganic salt, followed by the typical functionalization with organic molecules. In this work we passivated small carbon nanoparticles by a combination of the surface-doping with nanoscale semiconductors and the organic functionalization, coupled with gel column fractionation to harvest the most fluorescent carbon dots, which exhibited fluorescence emission quantum yields of up to 78%. Experimental and mechanistic issues relevant to potentially further improve the performance of carbon dots toward their being quantitatively fluorescent are discussed.									93	2	0	14	0	95			2040-3364			WOS:000290531500014	21350751

The challenge of making probes with fast absorption rates and good retention capacity was addressed theoretically and experimentally. This work shows that the probe should possess two levels of pore hierarchy: nanopores are needed to enhance the capillary action and micrometer pores are required to speed up fluid transport. The model of controlled fluid absorption was verified in experiments. We also demonstrated that the artificial proboscises can be remotely controlled by electric or magnetic fields. Using an artificial proboscis, one can approach a drop of hazardous liquid, absorb it and safely deliver it to an analytical device. With these materials, the paradigm of a stationary microfluidic platform can be shifted to the flexible structures that would allow one to pack multiple microfluidic sensors into a single fiber.									19	0	0	6	0	19			2040-3364			WOS:000296659000030	21994037	
J	Fleming, David S; Allen, Lawrence R; Barcelona, Robert J								Back to the future: The potential relationship between leisure and education.								New directions for youth development				2011	130			43	57		10.1002/yd.396			2011	2011	There is a long, documented history of the relationships among leisure, recreation, and education dating back to Greek philosophy.Originally there was little differentiation among the terms as they were presented as a unified process for youth and human development. Over time, each of these fields has developed, and their definitions have been shaped and reshaped. Using some of the original conceptions from Aristotle and Plato, coupled with foundational premises suggested by Dewey, this article frames current youth development efforts in a historical context. The authors suggest that perhaps what the separate professions might define as high-quality leisure, recreation, and educational experiences still maintain links among each. They further suggest that planned experiences with increasing levels of coordination can strengthen these links and develop an "education-for-leisure" perspective among participating youth and the choices they make. Self-determination theory (SDT) refers to the autonomy in choosing a particular behavior or action. Youth development opportunities that make connections between the content of a regular school day and choice of activity during out-of-school time can inculcate self-determined leisure choices that are productive. Planned and intentional educational experiences expand the possibilities for productive recreational choices. This article therefore proposes a framework for increasing levels of coordination among educational and recreational entities so that participating youth can develop and adopt an education-for-leisure disposition.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1537-5781		MEDLINE:21786409	21786409	
J	Mainella, Fran P; Agate, Joel R; Clark, Brianna S								Outdoor-based play and reconnection to nature: a neglected pathway to positive youth development.								New directions for youth development				2011	130			89	104		10.1002/yd.399			2011	2011	Throughout history, outdoor-based play and the connection to nature have been recognized as important contributors to a happy life and healthy development. At times, however, play and nature have been neglected and viewed as frivolous and wasteful. In the early twentieth century, the first play movement took place to get children out of the factories and back outdoors to play. Now, a century later, factors including twenty-four-hour media,stranger danger, and overscheduling of children's time have resulted in a level of play deprivation that is contributing to a host of social, emotional, and physical problems. This article draws on recent research that shows that as many as 40 percent of America's schools have eliminated or significantly reduced recess. Also, children and adolescents are spending an average of fifty-three hours each week in front of screen media, and only 31 percent of mothers report that their children play outside as frequently as they did as children. The deficits in outdoor-based play that arise from these lifestyles have resulted in significant increases in emotional and psychological disorders, decreased capacity to deal with stressors, and decreased physical fitness. This article describes specific organizations and programs that address the problem of play deprivation and reconnection to the outdoors.									8	0	0	2	0	8				1537-5781		MEDLINE:21786412	21786412	
J	Barcelona, Robert J; Hurd, Amy R; Bruggeman, Jennifer A								A competency-based approach to preparing staff as recreation and youth development leaders.								New directions for youth development				2011	130			121	39		10.1002/yd.401			2011	2011	Youth development professionals and parks and recreation professionals often are charged with providing services to youth. However, the approach of each can be quite different as recreation is a primary focus for recreation professionals and part of many services offered by youth development specialists. Despite the differences, these two groups of professionals can learn a great deal from each other. This article examines youth development and staff training with examples from the field and suggests how youth development professionals can learn from recreation professionals and vice versa. It suggests that parks and recreation professionals can strengthen degree programs, accreditation, certification, and continuing education by incorporating specific youth development competencies established by the National Collaboration for Youth. For their part, youth development professionals can learn from parks and recreation professionals how to enhance recreation programming as part of their services by gaining an understanding of program design, program and activity leadership, and administrative practices. With much debate over whether more education or more experience is a better path for those working with youth, the authors suggest that a combination of both will adhere to the quality of staff. Staff gain further knowledge and skill from academic preparation at the undergraduate and graduate levels, field-based training through jobs and internships, and continuing education courses specializing in youth development competencies and recreation-based competencies set within a youth development environment.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1537-5781		MEDLINE:21786414	21786414

These stresses may induce the production of compounds that are structurally and biologically different from constitutive compounds.We studied how warming and altered precipitation affected the composition, structure, and biological reactivity of leaf litter tannins in Acer rubrum at the Boston-Area Climate Experiment, in Massachusetts, USA.Warmer and drier climatic conditions led to higher concentrations of protective compounds, including flavonoids and cutin. The abundance and structure of leaf tannins also responded consistently to climatic treatments. Drought and warming in combination doubled the concentration of total tannins, which reached 30% of leaf-litter DW. This treatment also produced condensed tannins with lower polymerization and a greater proportion of procyanidin units, which in turn reduced sequestration of tannins by litter fiber. Furthermore, because of the structural flexibility of these tannins, litter from this treatment exhibited five times more enzyme (beta-glucosidase) complexation capacity on a per-weight basis. Warmer and wetter conditions decreased the amount of foliar condensed tannins.Our finding that warming and drought result in the production of highly reactive tannins is novel, and highly relevant to climate change research as these tannins, by immobilizing microbial enzymes, could slow litter decomposition and thus carbon and nutrient cycling in a warmer, drier world.									35	2	0	36	0	37			0028-646X			WOS:000291229500015	21371041

Evaluation of a copper hydroxide-based algicide to eliminate propagules of Phytophthora spp. in naturally-infested streams in South Carolina, USA: a preliminary report.								New Zealand Journal of Forestry Science				41	Suppl. 1			S3	S5					2011	2011	Many algicides are registered for use in potable water, irrigation ponds, and swimming pools. Because oomycetes, including species of Phytophthora de Bary, are closely related to brown algae, algicides also may prove to be effective at eliminating propagules of Phytophthora spp. from water. In laboratory studies, we have shown that two copper-based algicides were lethal to zoospores, sporangia, and chlamydospores of several species of Phytophthora. These algicides also were lethal to propagules of species of Phytophthora naturally occurring in six streams in the northwest region of South Carolina, USA. Recently, we have investigated the effects of season and temperature on the efficacy of an algicide containing copper hydroxide (Cu[OH](2)) as the active ingredient on natural populations of Phytophthora spp. in two streams. Water samples of 10 L were collected monthly in February, April, June, August, and November 2009 and were maintained at 5, 10, or 22 degrees C during treatment. Propagules usually were not detected at 2 h after treatment and never were detected at 4 h after treatment. The copper hydroxide algicide was effective in all five months and over a range of temperatures; therefore, it may provide an effective management strategy for species of Phytophthora present in some waterways.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0048-0134			BCI:BCI201100251262

DNA cleavage analysis using mutants defective in DNA binding and Mn(2+) as a metal cofactor reveals a novel 3'-exonuclease activity in endonuclease V [Feng,H., Dong,L., Klutz,A.M., Aghaebrahim,N. and Cao,W. (2005) Defining amino acid residues involved in DNA-protein interactions and revelation of 3'-exonuclease activity in endonuclease V. Biochemistry, 44, 11486-11495.]. This study defines the enzymatic nature of the endonuclease and exonuclease activity in endonuclease V from Thermotoga maritima. In addition to its well-known inosine-dependent endonuclease, Tma endonuclease V also exhibits inosine-dependent 3'-exonuclease activity. The dependence on an inosine site and the exonuclease nature of the 3'-exonuclease activity was demonstrated using 5'-labeled and internally-labeled inosine-containing DNA and a H214D mutant that is defective in non-specific nuclease activity. Detailed kinetic analysis using 3'-labeled DNA indicates that Tma endonuclease V also possesses non-specific 5'-exonuclease activity. The multiplicity of the endonuclease and exonuclease activity is discussed with respect to deaminated base repair.									4	0	0	4	0	4			0305-1048			WOS:000286675300019	20852258

In this study, organic cows' milk and two commercial substitutes were digested in vitro and tested for their effects on the growth of cultures of prostate and breast cancer cells. Cows' milk stimulated the growth of LNCaP prostate cancer cells in each of 14 separate experiments, producing an average increase in growth rate of over 30%. In contrast, almond milk suppressed the growth of these cells by over 30%. Neither cows' milk nor almond milk affected the growth of MCF-7 breast cancer cells or AsPC-1 pancreatic cancer cells significantly. Soy milk increased the growth rate of the breast cancer cells. These data indicate that prostate and breast cancer patients should be cautioned about the possible promotional effects of commercial dairy products and their substitutes.									10	0	0	2	0	10			0163-5581			WOS:000299396600022	22043817

In the present study, dietary treatment with saturated fats, trans fats, or cholesterol to middle-aged Fischer 344 rats resulted in alterations to serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels, organ weights, and hippocampal morphology. Previously, we demonstrated that a 10% hydrogenated coconut oil and 2% cholesterol diet resulted in worse performance on the 12-day water radial arm maze, increased cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and decreased dendritic microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2) staining in the hippocampus. The diets administered herein were used to examine components from the previous diet and further examine their effects on hippocampal morphology. Specifically, neuronal morphology, dendritic integrity, fatty acid metabolism, microgliosis, and blood vessel structure in the hippocampus and/or adjacent structures were explored. Our results indicate alterations to peripheral and neural systems following each of the diets.									13	2	0	10	0	15			1028-415X			WOS:000290094300004	21535919

Traditional point-scanning is remained in this streak-mode FD-OCT so that the small aperture of the single-mode fiber functions as a confocal gate and screens multiply scattered photons very well. While the sample beam is scanning the specimen laterally, the interference spectrum is physically scanned on the area scan camera using a streak scanner. Therefore, pixels of the camera are illuminated by the spectrum of the OCT signal row by row, corresponding to each A-scan at different lateral position. A unidirectional B-scan of 700 lines is obtained in 1 ms; thus, an A-scan time of 1.4 mu s is achieved. A Day 4 chick embryo sample is imaged using this method. This technique is highly potent for multi-Megahertz OCT imaging.

Using sodium hydride as a base afforded vinyl substitution products R-Ar-O-CF = CF-O-Ar-R', where R or R' = H, Br, OMe, tert-Bu, or Ph. The vinyl substitution products produced mixtures of (Z)/(E)-isomers and this isomer ratio was influenced by substitution with more sterically encumbered phenol nucleophiles. Reactions using caesium carbonate afforded addition products R-Ar-O-CHFCF(2)-O-Ar-R' whereas upon dehydrofluorination using sodium hydride produced vinyl substitution products. The preparation of vinyl substituted and addition products proceeded in overall good isolated yields and were elucidated using (1)H and (19)F NMR, GC-MS, and X-ray analysis. Vinyl substituted products were inert to UV light and chemical reactivity using common polymerization promoters. Thermal activation of the (Z)/(E)-fluoroolefin (-CF = CF-) was observed at an onset of 310 degrees C in nitrogen using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) producing insoluble network material. The synthesis, characterization, and mechanism for stereoselectivity are discussed.									18	0	0	2	0	18			1477-0520			WOS:000291654800024	21552580

Cellular studies are critical to understanding how polyphenol antioxidants can reduce oxidative stress and contribute to disease prevention. Many studies of polyphenol antioxidant mechanisms in E. coli and human cells have focused primarily on reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and enzyme regulation, although iron-mediated hydroxyl radical generation and DNA damage is the primary cause of cell death for both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells under oxidative stress. Recently, metal chelation has also been reported as a major contributor to cellular polyphenol antioxidant activity. Because ROS scavenging, enzyme regulation, and metal chelation mechanisms for polyphenol antioxidant activity are interrelated in vitro and in cellular systems, understanding the contribution of each mechanism to polyphenol antioxidant behavior is extremely challenging. Additionally, the wide variety of assays used to examine polyphenol antioxidant behavior makes comparing results between methods and between studies difficult. The complex relationships between ROS scavenging, enzyme regulation, and metal chelation mechanisms make selecting the appropriate cellular experiments vital to accurate mechanistic results, and incorrectly selected methods can lead to conflicting conclusions. Poor understanding of polyphenol cellular uptake also results in inconsistencies between in vitro, cellular, and in vivo studies. This chapter discusses and compares the evidence to support each of the three major mechanisms for polyphenol antioxidant activity in E. coli and human cells and describes the relationships between these three cellular mechanisms.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0097-6156		978-0-8412-2683-8	WOS:000312747000005

We investigate the effects of ion size and electrode curvature on the electrical double layers (EDLs) in two ILs 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride [BMIM][Cl] and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate [BMIM][PF6], using a combination of molecular dynamics (MD) and quantum density functional theory (DFT) simulations. The sizes of the counter-ion and co-ion affect the ion distribution and orientational structure of EDLs. The EDL capacitances near both planar and cylindrical electrodes were found to follow the order: [BMIM][Cl] (near the positive electrode) > [BMIM][PF6] (near the positive electrode) approximate to [BMIM][Cl] (near the negative electrode) approximate to [BMIM][PF6] (near the negative electrode). The EDL capacitance was also found to increase as the electrode curvature increases. These capacitance data can be fit to the Helmholtz model and the recently proposed exohedral electrical double-cylinder capacitor (xEDCC) model when the EDL thickness is properly parameterized, even though key features of the EDLs in ILs are not accounted for in these models. To remedy the shortcomings of existing models, we propose a "Multiple Ion Layers with Overscreening" (MILO) model for the EDLs in ILs that takes into account two critical features of such EDLs, i.e., alternating layering of counter-ions and co-ions and charge overscreening. The capacitance computed from the MILO model agrees well with the MD prediction. Although some input parameters of the MILO model must be obtained from MD simulations, the MILO model may provide a new framework for understanding many important aspects of EDLs in ILs (e. g., the variation of EDL capacitance with the electrode potential) that are difficult to interpret using classical EDL models and experiments.									86	0	0	6	0	86			1463-9076			WOS:000285750100039	21079823

Since electrical double layers (EDLs) are the cornerstone for the applications of RTILs in electrochemical systems such as supercapacitors, it is important to develop an understanding of the structure-capacitance relationships for the EDLs of these systems. Here we present a theoretical framework termed "counter-charge layer in generalized solvents" (CGS) for describing the structure and capacitance of the EDLs in neat RTILs and in RTILs mixed with different mass fractions of organic solvents. Within this framework, an EDL is made up of a counter-charge layer exactly balancing the electrode charge, and of polarized generalized solvents (in the form of layers of ion pairs, each of which has a zero net charge but has a dipole moment-the ion pairs thus can be considered as a generalized solvent) consisting of all RTILs inside the system except the counter-ions in the counter-charge layer, together with solvent molecules if present. Several key features of the EDLs that originate from the strong ion-ion correlation in RTILs, e. g., overscreening of electrode charge and alternating layering of counter-ions and co-ions, are explicitly incorporated into this framework. We show that the dielectric screening in EDLs is governed predominantly by the polarization of generalized solvents (or ion pairs) in the EDL, and the capacitance of an EDL can be related to its microstructure with few a priori assumptions or simplifications. We use this framework to understand two interesting phenomena observed in molecular dynamics simulations of EDLs in a neat IL of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([BMIM][BF(4)]) and in a mixture of [BMIM][BF(4)] and acetonitrile (ACN): (1) the capacitance of the EDLs in the [BMIM][BF(4)]/ACN mixture increases only slightly when the mass fraction of ACN in the mixture increases from zero to 50% although the dielectric constant of bulk ACN is more than two times higher than that of neat [BMIM][BF4]; (2) the capacitance of EDLs near negative electrodes (with BMIM(+) ion as the counter-ion) is smaller than that near positive electrodes (with BF(4)(-) as the counter-ion) although the closest approaches of both ions to the electrode surface are nearly identical.									45	2	0	1	0	45			1463-9076			WOS:000293516200053	21755079

Often, leadership is described based on managerial styles, leadership types and styles, emotional intelligence, and work climate. However, little work explores leadership specifically within engineering and educational environment. The motivation of this research is further inspired based on the researcher's own experience in undergraduate engineering design teams and the lack of formal leadership structure and training in typical engineering education programs. Leadership is identified in this research through conducting case study research by examining two undergraduate engineering design teams addressing different projects in different course settings. The results and conclusions from each study are extracted by triangulating within and across each of the data collection methods. Through these two case studies, leadership is clearly found present in both cases and with task-oriented leadership being the more prevalent type.					18th International Conference on Engineering Design (ICED)18th International Conference on Engineering Design (ICED)	AUG 15-18, 2011AUG 15-18, 2011	Tech Univ Denmark (DTU), Dept Management Engn, Sect Engn Design & Prod Dev; Design SocTech Univ Denmark (DTU), Dept Management Engn, Sect Engn Design & Prod Dev; Design Soc	Tech Univ Denmark (DTU), Copenhagen, DENMARKTech Univ Denmark (DTU), Copenhagen, DENMARK	0	0	0	0	0	0			2220-4334		978-1-904670-28-5	WOS:000318594900011

Eleven atomic tasks of topologic reasoning, divided in two categories, connectedness and derivation, are identified that could be used to check graph-based function structures against conservation laws using only the count and types of flows attached to the functions. This reasoning is illustrated by simulating the sequential actions of a designer developing a new mechanical device. The algorithms are validated by implementing them in a function modeling software that first allows the designer to construct a function model and then detects violations of conservation laws in the model appropriately.					18th International Conference on Engineering Design (ICED)18th International Conference on Engineering Design (ICED)	AUG 15-18, 2011AUG 15-18, 2011	Tech Univ Denmark (DTU), Dept Management Engn, Sect Engn Design & Prod Dev; Design SocTech Univ Denmark (DTU), Dept Management Engn, Sect Engn Design & Prod Dev; Design Soc	Tech Univ Denmark (DTU), Copenhagen, DENMARKTech Univ Denmark (DTU), Copenhagen, DENMARK	0	0	0	0	0	0			2220-4334		978-1-904670-29-2	WOS:000318595800038

After molding, the binder is removed from the part, and the compact is sintered to almost full density. The obstacle to sinter bonding a MIM part to a conventional (solid) substrate lies in the sinter shrinkage of the MIM part, which can be up to 20%, meaning that the MIM part shrinks during sintering, while the conventional substrate maintains its dimensions. This behavior would typically inhibit bonding and/or cause cracking and deformation of the MIM part. A structure of micro features molded onto the surface of the MIM part allows for shrinkage while bonding to the substrate. The micro features tolerate certain plastic deformation to permit the shrinkage without causing cracks after the initial bonds are established. In a first series of tests, bond strengths of up to 80% of that of resistance welds have been achieved. This paper describes how the authors developed their proposed method of sinter bonding and how they accomplished effective sinter bonds between MIM parts and solid substrates.					6th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference / 4th JSME/ASME International Conference on Materials and Processing6th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference / 4th JSME/ASME International Conference on Materials and Processing	JUN 13-17, 2011JUN 13-17, 2011		Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OROregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-4430-4	WOS:000320096800003

The reduction of forming load was formulated previously assuming that a part of the electrical energy input is dissipated into heat, thus producing thermal softening of the material, while the remaining component directly aids the plastic deformation. The fraction of electrical energy applied that assists the deformation process compared to the total amount of electrical energy is given by the electroplastic effect coefficient.The objective of the current research is to investigate the complex effect of the electricity applied during deformation, and to establish a methodology for quantifying the electroplastic effect coefficient. Temperature behavior is observed for varying levels of deformation and previous cold work. Results are used to refine the understanding of the electroplastic effect coefficient, and a new relationship, in the form of a power law, is derived. This model is validated under independent experiments in Grade 2 (commercially pure) and Grade 5 (Ti-6Al-4V) titanium.					6th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference / 4th JSME/ASME International Conference on Materials and Processing6th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference / 4th JSME/ASME International Conference on Materials and Processing	JUN 13-17, 2011JUN 13-17, 2011		Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OROregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR	3	0	0	0	0	3					978-0-7918-4430-4	WOS:000320096800070		
B	Jones, Joshua J.; Mears, Laine			ASME					CONSTANT CURRENT DENSITY COMPRESSION BEHAVIOR OF 304 STAINLESS STEEL AND Ti-6AL-4V DURING ELECTRICALLY-ASSISTED FORMING								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME INTERNATIONAL MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING CONFERENCE 2011, VOL 1								629	637					2011	2011	A metal forming technique which has more recently come of interest as an alternative to processes that use elevated temperatures at some stage during manufacturing is Electrically-Assisted Forming (EAF). EAF is a processing technique which applies electrical current through the workpiece concurrently while the material is being formed. At present, this method has only been studied on an experimental level in laboratory settings, and the heuristic results show increased fracture strain, reduced flow stress, and reduced springback; the enhanced process capability is beyond the range that would be expected from pure resistive heating alone. Thus far, when applying the electrical current through the workpiece during deformation, the current magnitude flowing through the workpiece has remained constant. Hence, for a compression loading, the current flux or density decreases as a result of an increasing specimen area. This work examines the effect of a non-constant current density (NCCD) and a constant current density (CCD) on the deformation behavior of 304 Stainless Steel and Ti-6Al-4V during uniaxial compression testing. Additionally, the application of a CCD is used to modify existing empirically-based EAF flow stress models for these materials. From this testing, it is shown that a CCD during forming can significantly reduce the flow stress of the material as compared to the NCCD tests. The reductions in the flow stress were increased at higher strains by approximately 30% and 15% for the 304 Stainless Steel and Ti-6Al-4V, respectively. More importantly, these flow stress curves are better representative of how the material responds to an applied electrical current as the specimen shape change is removed from the results. Also, the NCCD tests were approximated using an existing empirically-based EAF flow stress model and the CCD tests concluded that a new flow stress predictor model be introduced.					6th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference / 4th JSME/ASME International Conference on Materials and Processing6th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference / 4th JSME/ASME International Conference on Materials and Processing	JUN 13-17, 2011JUN 13-17, 2011		Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OROregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR	4	0	0	0	0	4					978-0-7918-4430-4	WOS:000320096800077

Sensor performance was investigated for frequencies ranging from 1 to 1,000 Hz using two testing setups: a load frame for low frequency characterization and a piezo-electric stack for describing higher-frequency behavior. Bode magnitude and phase response plots were developed and it was determined that the sensor under study can be modeled as a first order system up to 600 Hz. The -3 dB bandwidth was found to be 90 Hz and the sensor's time constant was determined to be 0.0018 seconds. A dynamic model of the sensor is constructed and compared against performance data. The sensor was found to have non-linear spring properties, allowing for two damping coefficients, one for each spring constant range, to be calculated. The damping coefficient was calculated to be 619 lb-s/in for loadings under 600 lbs and 1928 lb-s/in for loadings greater than 600 lbs. The sensor's time response was also found to be more similar in shape to the input loading waveform when it was compared to piezoelectric load transducers.					6th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference / 4th JSME/ASME International Conference on Materials and Processing6th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference / 4th JSME/ASME International Conference on Materials and Processing	JUN 13-17, 2011JUN 13-17, 2011		Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OROregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-4431-1	WOS:000320096500027

CBM does this by indicating, in advance, the failure of the machine tool components or system, thus reducing the machine downtime. In this paper, the development of such a system is sought. A background review of the need and structure of such a system has been provided as well as the design considerations for the system are discussed. Having those considerations as the target requirements for a CBM system, discussion of a demonstrative system is presented, being implemented on an OKUMA LB 3000EX CNC lathe. Leveraging the Open Architecture Control (OAC) technology built into OKUMA CNC systems, the proposed system shall enhance machine monitoring by integrating the internal and external sensors aboard the machine tool. This work lays the foundation for the framework of a proposed CBM system. Coolant temperatures and spindle vibration signals are acquired and processed using a high speed data acquisition system. Towards the end of the paper, descriptions of how to best use this data and integrate it with the machine tool CNC system have been provided.					6th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference / 4th JSME/ASME International Conference on Materials and Processing6th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference / 4th JSME/ASME International Conference on Materials and Processing	JUN 13-17, 2011JUN 13-17, 2011		Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OROregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-4431-1	WOS:000320096500029

In this paper, real time control of the machining process to maintain dimensional quality when turning a slender bar is addressed. The goal is to actively control the machining feed rate to maintain constant and predicable deflection through a combined force-stiffness model integrated to the process controller. A brief review is presented on manufacturing process models, process monitoring, and model based control strategies such as Model Predictive Control (MPC). The main objective of this paper is to outline a method for deploying such models to process control. To demonstrate this, model of the deflection of the workpiece under tool cutting forces is developed. Unknown process parameters have been calculated using series of FEA simulations and verified with basic experimental data. A simple but effective control strategy has been formulated and simulated. In the initial results, the diameter of bar is maintained within 1.04% error with controller as opposed to up to 4% error without controller.Ultimately, the goal is to deploy such control strategies in the industrial control system. With the continual development in physical understanding of machining processes and affordable computing technology (both software and hardware) coupled with Open Architecture Control (OAC) applied to CNC machine tools, such approaches are now computationally feasible. This will be an enabling factor to deploy model based control in an industrial environment. The last section discusses the proposed hardware architecture to achieve this. The paper concludes with a brief plan for the future work and a summary.					6th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference / 4th JSME/ASME International Conference on Materials and Processing6th ASME International Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference / 4th JSME/ASME International Conference on Materials and Processing	JUN 13-17, 2011JUN 13-17, 2011		Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OROregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR	0	0	0	0	0	0					978-0-7918-4431-1	WOS:000320096500031

This study hypothesized that in TKR systems, a highly cross-linked (HXL) UHMWPE blended with vitamin E will result in reduced wear as compared to a direct compression-moulded (DCM) UHMWPE. A wear simulation study was conducted using an asymmetric lateral pivoting '3D Knee' design to compare the two inserts. The highly cross-linked UHMWPE was aged prior to the testing and force-controlled wear testing was carried out for 5 million cycles using a load-controlled ISO-14243 standard at a frequency of 1 Hz on both groups. Gravimetric measurements of DCM UHMWPE (4.4 +/- 3.0 mg/million cycles) and HXL UHMWPE with vitamin E (1.9 +/- 1.9 mg/million cycles) showed significant statistical differences (p < 0.01) between the wear rates. Wear modes and surface roughness for both groups revealed no significant dissimilarities.									9	1	1	2	0	11			0954-4119			WOS:000286627600001	21381482

Single flexion-axis selection influences femoral component alignment and kinematics during knee simulation								PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART H-JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING IN MEDICINE				225	H8			762	768		10.1177/0954411911400534			2011	2011	The objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of the implant geometry and alignment on its surface displacement, and to show that the proposed method of alignment can be used to improve the consistency of total knee replacement alignment for knee simulation. Poor femoral flexion-axis selection in the alignment process can possibly alter the intended design's functionality and introduce significant anterior/posterior (A/P), and proximal/distal (P/D) displacements. In the study, four multi-axis femoral components from each of two different manufacturers, NKII and 3DKnee, were used. A custom-built femoral alignment and surface measurement instrument was used to adjust and locate the single femoral axis position for each implant, which would optimally minimize their P/D displacements and A/P translations. The aligned NKII implants yielded a mean implant maximum P/D and A/P contact point shifts of 0.577 +/- 0.078 mm (+/- std. dev.) and of 2.325 +/- 0.243 mm between 0 and 60 degrees of flexion, which was significantly different from the aligned 3DKnee, 0.415 +/- 0.157 mm and 0.800 +/- 0.1512 mm (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001). Future work is needed to quantify the effect of femoral flexion axis selection on resulting long-term wear, damage areas, and soft tissue loading during simulation.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0954-4119			WOS:000294000500004	21922953

Chest examinations were simulated for a gantry CT scanner geometry with projections acquired for a beam width of 4 cm. PCXMC 2.0.1 was used to calculate patient effective doses at 15 degrees intervals around the patient's isocentre, and at nine locations along the patient long axis. Idealised tube current modulation schemes were modelled as a function of the X-ray tube angle and the patient long axis. Tube current modulations were characterised by the modulation amplitude R, which was allowed to vary between 1.5 and 5. Effective dose maxima occur for anteroposterior projections at the location of the (radiosensitive) breasts. The maximum to minimum ratio of effective doses as a function of the patient long axis was 4.9, and as a function of the X-ray tube angle was 2.1. Doubling the value of R reduces effective doses from longitudinal modulation alone by similar to 4 % and from angular modulation alone by similar to 2 %. In chest CT, tube current modulation schemes currently have longitudinal R values of similar to 2.2, and angular R values that range between 1.5 and 3.4. Current X-ray tube current modulation schemes are expected to reduce patient effective doses in chest CT examinations by similar to 10 %, with longitudinal modulation accounting for two-thirds and angular modulation for the remaining one-third.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0144-8420			WOS:000287391800014	21068019

Graphene, a one atom thick honeycomb lattice of carbon, is a highly desired material for MEMS applications. Relevant properties of graphene include the material's optical transparency, mechanical strength, energy efficiency, and electrical and thermal conductivity due to its electron mobility. Aforementioned properties make graphene a strong candidate to supplant existing transparent electrode technology and replace the conventionally used material, indium-tin oxide. In this paper we present preliminary results on work toward integration of graphene with MEMS structures.We are studying mechanical exfoliation of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) crystals by repeatedly applying and separating adhesive materials from the HOPG surface. The resulting graphene sheets are then transferred to silicon oxide substrate using the previously applied adhesive material. We explored different adhesive options, particularly the use of Kapton tape, to improve the yield of graphene isolation along with chemical cross-linking agents which operate on a mechanism of photoinsertion of disassociated nitrene groups. These perfluorophenyl nitrenes participate in C=C addition reactions with graphene monolayers creating a covalent binding between the substrate and graphene. We are focusing on maximizing the size of isolated graphene sheets and comparing to conventional exfoliation. Preliminary results allow isolation of few layer graphene (FLG) sheets (n<3) of approximately 10 mu m x 44 mu m. Photolithography could possibly be utilized to tailor designs for microshutter technology to be used in future deep space telescopes.

With a particular mesh construction, the Scott-Vogelius element pair has recently been shown to be inf-sup stable and have optimal approximation properties, while also providing pointwise mass conservation. We present herein the first numerical tests of this element pair for the time dependent Navier-Stokes equations. We also prove that the limit of the grad-div stabilized Taylor-Hood solutions to the Navier-Stokes problem converges to the Scott-Vogelius solution as the stabilization parameter tends to infinity. That is, we provide theoretical justification that choosing the grad-div parameter large does not destroy the solution. Numerical tests are provided which verify the theory and show how both Scott-Vogelius and grad-div stabilized Taylor-Hood (with large stabilization parameter) elements can provide accurate results with excellent mass conservation for Navier-Stokes approximations.									33	0	0	0	0	33			0036-1429	1095-7170		WOS:000294291900007

J	Zha, Liusheng; Banik, Brittany; Alexis, Frank								Stimulus responsive nanogels for drug delivery								SOFT MATTER				7	13			5908	5916		10.1039/c0sm01307b			2011	2011	Stimulus responsive nanogels are polymeric nanoparticles which are capable of responding to external stimuli by changing their physico-chemical properties, such as volume, water content, refractive index, permeability, and hydrophilicity-hydrophobicity. Compared with other polymer nanoparticles used for drug delivery, stimulus responsive nanogels are noted for their ability to encapsulate bioactive drugs, their high stability for prolonged circulation in the blood stream, and their controlled release and site-specific targeting of loaded drugs modulated by environment stimuli. Particularly, the application of stimulus responsive nanogels provides an interesting opportunity for drug delivery in which the delivery system becomes an active participant, rather than a passive carrier, in the optimization of disease therapy. In this article, the authors review the recent developments in the preparation and application in drug delivery of stimulus responsive nanogels which can respond to small temperature and pH changes, light, magnetic field, biomolecule recognition (specifically glucose responsive nanogels for insulin delivery), and multi-responsive nanogels. The limitations and future improvements of stimulus responsive nanogels are also discussed.									137	15	0	25	0	145			1744-683X	1744-6848		WOS:000291876600002

Multifaceted assessment of species validity in the Dasymutilla bioculata species group (Hymenoptera: Mutillidae)								SYSTEMATIC ENTOMOLOGY				36	1			180	191		10.1111/j.1365-3113.2010.00555.x			JAN 2011	2011	This study examines the validity of the ten species and eight subspecies composing the Dasymutilla bioculata species group. Four lines of evidence are examined: morphological data derived from both sexes; behavioural data derived from the study of mating pairs; geographic distribution; and molecular data derived from the internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2 of the nuclear ribosomal RNA cistron (ITS1 and ITS2). Morphological studies reveal that none of the taxa in question can be consistently diagnosed by any synapomorphies or unique combinations of characters. Mating studies reveal that males of single nominal taxa are attracted to females of multiple nominal taxa, and that females of single nominal taxa attract multiple males. None of the nominal taxa are geographically isolated from the others. Genetic distances between these taxa are significantly lower than those seen in interspecific comparisons of other Dasymutilla species. Based on this evidence, we infer that the taxa in question share a recent common ancestor, and cannot be adequately differentiated using any of the available data sources. Therefore, employing the phylogenetic species concept, Dasymutilla bimaculata Manley & Pitts, Dasymutilla chiron chiron (Blake), Dasymutilla chiron ursula (Cresson), Dasymutilla creusa creusa (Cresson), Dasymutilla creusa bellona (Cresson), Dasymutilla lepeletierii (Fox), Dasymutilla medea (Cresson), Dasymutilla melanippe melanippe Mickel, Dasymutilla melanippe conformis Mickel, Dasymutilla praegrandis praegrandis Mickel, Dasymutilla praegrandis russata Mickel, Dasymutilla pyrrhus (Fox) and Dasymutilla sulcatulla Mickel must be considered junior synonyms of Dasymutilla bioculata (Cresson). We also discuss the identification of this species, as well as subspecific relationships and species-group implications.									6	0	0	6	0	6			0307-6970	1365-3113		WOS:000286002500013

Assembly and Testing of Stem Cell-Seeded Layered Collagen Constructs for Heart Valve Tissue Engineering								TISSUE ENGINEERING PART A				17	1-2			25	36		10.1089/ten.tea.2010.0138			JAN 2011	2011	Tissue engineering holds great promise for treatment of valvular diseases. Despite excellent progress in the field, current approaches do not fully take into account each patient's valve anatomical uniqueness, the presence of a middle spongiosa cushion that allows shearing of external fibrous layers (fibrosa and ventricularis), and the need for autologous valvular interstitial cells. In this study we propose a novel approach to heart valve tissue engineering based on bioreactor conditioning of mesenchymal stem cell-seeded, valve-shaped constructs assembled from layered collagenous scaffolds. Fibrous scaffolds were prepared by decellularization of porcine pericardium and spongiosa scaffolds by decellularization and elastase treatment of porcine pulmonary arteries. To create anatomically correct constructs, we created silicone molds from native porcine aortic valves, dried two identical fibrous scaffolds onto the molds, and stabilized them with penta-galloyl-glucose a reversible collagen-binding polyphenol that reduces biodegradation. The layers were fused with a protein/aldehyde scaffold bio-adhesive and neutralized to reduce cytotoxicity. Spongiosa scaffolds, seeded with human bone marrow-derived stem cells, were inserted within the valve-shaped layered scaffolds and sutured inside the original aortic root. The final product was mounted in a heart valve bioreactor and cycled in cell culture conditions. Most cells were alive after 8 days, elongated significantly, and stained positive for vimentin, similar to native human valvular interstitial cells, indicating feasibility of our approach.									29	2	0	19	0	31			1937-3341			WOS:000285995800004	20673028

Methods: Porcine cartilage was stored as either bisected femoral heads with bone attached or plugs without the underlying bone in culture medium with fetal bovine serum for 1 month at 4 degrees C. Metabolic activity was tested using a resazurin reduction method on intact tissue and viable cell recovery after enzymatic tissue digestion at each time point. Cartilage plug permeability was evaluated by measuring electrical conductivity. Results: Storage in culture medium provided good cartilage viability and metabolic function for 7 days; however, significant changes were observed in femoral heads (p < 0.05). All mean chondrocyte assessment values were < 30% of fresh controls at 28 days. Cartilage plugs tended to perform better after 7 days of storage than the femoral heads and retained significantly higher metabolic activity (mean = 94.5% vs. 70.5%; p < 0.05). Cartilage plugs demonstrated consistent changes in electrical conductivity after 28 days of storage (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Refrigerated storage of cartilage results in both loss of chondrocyte viability and matrix permeability.									5	1	0	4	0	6			1660-3796			WOS:000298377100007	22403523	
J	Math, Sujay; Wingard, David; Rangaraju, Prasada Rao					Rangaraju, Prasada Rao/0000-0003-4285-1252			Assessing Potential Reactivity of Aggregates in Presence of Potassium Acetate Deicer Revised Mortar Bar Test Method								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD					2232			10	24		10.3141/2232-02			2011	2011	The standard ASTM C1260 and ASTM C1293 test methods focus on identifying aggregate reactivity in the presence of alkali hydroxides. The sensitivity of these test methods to assess aggregate reactivity in the presence of deicing chemicals is unknown. Preliminary efforts to develop a test method to identify aggregate reactivity in the presence of deicing chemicals yielded a mortar bar test (EB-70 test) based on soaking the mortar bars containing the suspect aggregates in a 6.4 molar potassium acetate (6.4 M KAc) deicer solution, instead of a 1 normal sodium hydroxide (1 N NaOH) solution, as in the standard ASTM C1260 test. The EB-70 test method was effective in identifying highly reactive aggregates but erratic in assessing moderate, slowly reactive aggregates. Deficiencies in that method were attributed to the lack of a precise understanding of the mechanisms involved in high pH jump observed on interaction of KAc with alkali hydroxides and calcium hydroxide. The knowledge gained in recent studies in understanding the mechanism has provided a sound basis for making some modifications to the EB-70 test method. A revised EB-70 test method is presented: it uses a 1 N NaOH and 3 M KAc deicer as its soak solution. Evidence from testing 31 different aggregates with a range of aggregate mineralogy and reactivity indicated that the revised method was effective in characterizing a range of aggregate reactivity in the presence of deicing chemicals. Limited studies were conducted to evaluate a low-lime fly ash (Class F) in mitigating mortar bar expansions in the EB-70 test method. A low-lime fly ash was effective in controlling mortar bar expansion in the revised EB-70 test method.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0361-1981			WOS:000298268900003

Effect of Fiber Addition, Heat Treatment, and Preset Pressure on Mechanical Properties of Ultra-High-Strength Mortars								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD					2240			59	69		10.3141/2240-09			2011	2011	In this study, efforts were undertaken to produce ultra-high-strength mortars (UHSM) from conventionally available materials. Selection of mixtures and optimization of mixtures were achieved by adopting the basic principles of UHSM and through trial studies. A preliminary investigation was carried out to assess the effects of different curing regimes on the strength development of UHSM. Effects of fiber addition, heat treatment, and preset pressure on the rate of strength development of UHSM mixtures were individually assessed to better understand their benefits in the production of UHSM. Mechanical properties of the heat-treated UHSM were then investigated to determine the performance of the UHSM developed from conventional materials. Results from this study suggested that for the production of UHSM, a multiple curing regime was best suited and was then used for further studies. Data on strength development indicated that heat treatment increased the strengths by 57% to 75%. With application of preset pressure, the compressive strengths of UHSM were increased significantly by 15% to 18%. The optimum quantity of fibers to produce UHSM was found to be 2% to 3%. Effectiveness of fibers in increasing the strength of UHSM was found to be higher for heat-cured specimens than for normal water-cured specimens. The maximum target strengths obtained from the UHSM were 194 MPa, 24 MPa, and 31 MPa for compression, split tension, and flexure, respectively. The UHSM also showed improved energy absorption and toughness characteristics, especially at higher-fiber dosages.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0361-1981			WOS:000299402800009

A characteristic map cracking pattern was observed on pavement surfaces that had experienced repeated applications of these deicers, and the suspected cause of this cracking pattern was accelerated alkali silica reaction (ASR). Laboratory-based research indicated that alkali silica reactive aggregates may undergo active deterioration when intimately exposed to such deicers under conditions promoting accelerated reaction. Investigations were conducted on cores collected from an airport whose deicing operations involved repeated applications of potassium acetate deicer. Detailed microscopic investigation indicated that uniform distress existed throughout the depth of the pavement, although in one, the distress resulted from alkali-carbonate reaction rather than from ASR. However, investigations on the depth of penetration of deicer into these pavement cores showed only limited incursion. A companion laboratory study estimated the extent of deicer penetration under different laboratory exposure conditions. Even in a relatively aggressive wetting and drying exposure regime, ingress of the deicer was limited. Thus, it was concluded that although the potassium acetate deicer can induce severe ASR under aggressive laboratory conditions, penetration into field airport pavements may be so limited in some cases that the potassium acetate deicer does not seem to aggravate the ASR distress should one already exist.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0361-1981			WOS:000299402800010

In addition, the influence of particle size (fineness) of fly ashes on ASR mitigation was evaluated, so that the relative significance of fineness and chemical composition of fly ash in mitigating ASR could be established. Findings from these studies confirm results from studies on the influence of lime content of ash on ASR mitigation. Blended fly ashes containing content of no more than 16.5% equivalent calcium oxide and no less than 66% equivalent silicon dioxide were found to be effective in mitigating ASR. The performance of blended fly ashes was comparable with that of virgin fly ashes of equivalent chemical composition. Finer fly ashes showed better ASR mitigation in the case of low- and intermediate-lime fly ashes. However, in the case of high-lime fly ashes, the effect of fineness could not be clearly resolved. Findings from this study indicate that both the physical and the chemical properties of fly ash are important in selecting ashes for developing blends that are effective in ASR mitigation.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0361-1981			WOS:000299402800011

Phase change materials exhibit large and reversible changes in optical properties (Delta n, Delta k) when switched between the amorphous and crystalline phases. Thermally-induced phase transitions from the insulating amorphous to the conductive crystalline state can be controlled through external means, facilitating the design of reconfigurable metamaterial devices that operate with ultrafast response times. In this work, robust global stochastic optimization algorithms were combined with full-wave electromagnetic simulation tools to design periodic subwavelength chalcogenide nanostructured arrays to meet the specified device performance goals in each phase. The measured optical properties (n, k) of deposited chalcogenide thin films and nanofabrication constraints were incorporated into the optimization algorithm to guarantee that the designed nanostructures could be manufactured. By choosing the appropriate cost functions, adaptive metamaterials were designed to switch between transmissive and reflective, transmissive and absorptive, and reflective and absorptive states. These design demonstrations represent a significant step forward in the development of adaptive infrared metamaterials.

Our successful collaboration has demonstrated how a pilot project which was originally intended only to demonstrate the value of usability testing to the revision of textbooks eventually impacted the product development process for a major publisher. Specifically, we found that exploring the limits of complexity in the handbooks we tested helped us move from what we call an accommodationist model of textbook design to a constructivist model.									0	0	0	0	0	0					978-1-4398-2895-3; 978-1-4398-2894-6	WOS:000375045800006

Current understanding of the pathogenesis of astrocytic tumors is limited in dogs compared with humans. In dogs, critical biological data concerning the natural history of disease progression, tumor imaging features, and response to therapeutic intervention are lacking. This review outlines the clinical, genetic, immunologic, and histopathologic characteristics of astrocytic tumors in dogs with special focus on comparative neuro-oncology. Common problems associated with the diagnosis of these neoplasms are summarized. Traditional veterinary histologic typing and grading of astrocytic tumors must be updated and supplemented with molecular data so that future studies directed toward therapeutic intervention and outcome can be optimized.									13	0	0	7	0	13			0300-9858			WOS:000287200500022	21059873

BFAs exerted higher chlorine demands as compared to natural organic matter (NOM) in filling waters. BFAs exhibited higher HAA formation potentials than THM formation potentials, while the opposite was observed for the filling water NOM. There was no appreciable difference in the HNM formation potentials of BFAs and filling water NOM. Different components in the BFAs tested exhibited different degree and type of DBP formation. Citric acid had significantly higher THM and HAA yields than other BFA components. The effect of temperature was greater on THM formation, whereas the effect of contact time had more impact on HAA formation. Experiments with filling waters collected from WTP effluents at three different times showed more variability in HAA than THM formation at the WTPs studied. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, adsorption of two SOCs by three single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), one multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWNT), a microporous activated carbon fiber (ACF) [i.e., ACF10] and a bimodal porous granular activated carbon (GAC) [i.e., HD4000] was compared in the presence and absence of NOM. The NOM effect was found to depend strongly on the pore size distribution of carbons. Minimal NOM effect occurred on the macroporous MWNT, whereas severe NOM effects were observed on the microporous HD4000 and ACF10. Although the single-solute adsorption capacities of the SWNTs were much lower than those of HD4000, in the presence of NOM the SWNTs exhibited adsorption capacities similar to those of HD4000. Therefore, if released into natural waters, SWNTs can behave like an activated carbon, and will be able to adsorb, carry, and transfer SOCs to other systems. However, from an engineering application perspective, CNTs did not exhibit a major advantage, in terms of adsorption capacities, over the GAC and ACF. The NOM effect was also found to depend on molecular properties of SOCs. NOM competition was more severe on the adsorption of 2-phenylphenol, a nonplanar and hydrophilic SOC, than phenanthrene, a planar and hydrophobic SOC, tested in this study. In terms of surface chemistry, both adsorption affinity to SOCs and NOM effect on SOC adsorption were enhanced with increasing hydrophobicity of the SWNTs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Efforts focused at developing new chalcogenide glass formulations and processing methods require rapid quantitative evaluation of their optical constants to guide the materials research. However, characterization of important optical parameters such as optical dispersion and thermal coefficient remains a slow and costly process, generally with limited accuracy. The recent development of a prism coupler at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) now enables rapid, high precision measurement of refractive indices at discrete wavelengths from the visible to the mid-infrared. Optical dispersion data of several chalcogenide glass families were collected using this method. Variations in the optical dispersion were correlated to glass composition and compared against measurements using other methods. While this work has been focused on facilitating chalcogenide glass synthesis, mid-infrared prism coupler analysis has broader applications to other mid-infrared optical material development efforts, including oxide glasses and crystalline materials.

Examination of cell extracts led us to detect a previously unknown xanthine DNA glycosylase (XDG) activity in E. coli. DNA glycosylase assays with purified enzymes indicated the novel XDG activity is attributable to MUG. Here, we report a biochemical characterization of xanthine DNA glycosylase activity in MUG. The wild type MUG possesses more robust activity against xanthine than uracil and is active against all xanthine-containing DNA (C/X, T/X, G/X, A/X and single-stranded X). Analysis of potentials of mean force indicates that the double-stranded xanthine base pairs have a relatively narrow energetic difference in base flipping, whereas the tendency for uracil base flipping follows the order of C/U > G/U > T/U > A/U. Site-directed mutagenesis performed on conserved motifs revealed that Asn-140 and Ser-23 are important determinants for XDG activity in E. coli MUG. Molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulations reveal distinct hydrogen-bonding patterns in the active site of E. coli MUG that account for the specificity differences between E. coli MUG and human thymine DNA glycosylase as well as that between the wild type MUG and the Asn-140 and Ser-23 mutants. This study underscores the role of the favorable binding interactions in modulating the specificity of DNA glycosylases.									9	0	0	7	0	9			0021-9258			WOS:000285622600034	20852254	
J	Stocks, Ian C.								Comparative and functional morphology of wing coupling structures in Trichoptera: Integripalpia								ANNALES ZOOLOGICI FENNICI				47	6			351	386					DEC 30 2010	2010	Trichoptera and several other insect orders have evolved functional diptery while retaining four wings (morphological tetraptery), which results from the interaction of specialized structures that unite the wings. In this contribution, the comparative and functional morphology of the forewing-hindwing coupling apparatuses and related structures in the suborder Integripalpia are presented. The components of the wing coupling apparatuses have varied and complex morphologies and interaction modes, that result in partial to complete wing coupling. Wing coupling has evolved repeatedly within the infraorders Brevitentoria and Plenitentoria, and the morphologies of the wing coupling apparatuses are synapomorphies for several families. Phylogenetic trends are discussed that relate to the evolution of functional diptery, such as the diminution of forewing jugal lobes and hindwing prehumeral setae, reinforcement of wing veins, changes in vein topology and elaboration of wing surface features. A novel at-rest forewing-forewing coupling apparatus that has also evolved repeatedly is described and related to the evolution of wing coupling.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0003-455X	1797-2450		WOS:000286082800001		
J	Gaines, William A.; Sehorn, Michael G.; Marcotte, William R., Jr.								Spidroin N-terminal Domain Promotes a pH-dependent Association of Silk Proteins during Self-assembly								JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY				285	52			40745	40753		10.1074/jbc.M110.163121			DEC 24 2010	2010	Spider silks are spun from concentrated solutions of spidroin proteins. The appropriate timing of spidroin assembly into organized fibers must be highly regulated to avoid premature fiber formation. Chemical and physical signals presented to the silk proteins as they pass from the ampulle and through the tapered duct include changes in ionic environment and pH as well as the introduction of shear forces. Here, we show that the N-terminal domain of spidroins from the major ampullate gland (MaSp-NTDs) for both Nephila and Latrodectus spiders associate noncovalently as homodimers. The MaSp-NTDs are highly pH-responsive and undergo a structural transition in the physiological pH range of the spider duct. Tryptophan fluorescence of the MaSp-NTDs reveals a change in conformation when pH is decreased, and the pH at which the transition occurs is determined by the amount and type of salt present. Size exclusion chromatography and pull-down assays both indicate that the lower pH conformation is associated with a significantly increased MaSp-NTD homodimer stability. By transducing the duct pH signal into specific protein-protein interactions, this conserved spidroin domain likely contributes significantly to the silk-spinning process. Based on these results, we propose a model of spider silk assembly dynamics as mediated through the MaSp-NTD.									42	5	0	29	0	47			0021-9258			WOS:000285414400038	20959449

Correlation between Desorption Force Measured by Atomic Force Microscopy and Adsorption Free Energy Measured by Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy for Peptide-Surface Interactions								LANGMUIR				26	24			18852	18861		10.1021/la103685d			DEC 21 2010	2010	Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy is a useful technique for thermodynamically characterizing peptide-surface interactions; however, its usefulness is limited to the types of surfaces that can readily be formed as thin layers on the nanometer scale on metallic biosensor substrates. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), on the other hand, can be used with any microscopically flat surface, thus making it more versatile for studying peptide-surface interactions. AFM, however, has the drawback of data interpretation due to questions regarding peptide-to-probe tip density. This problem could be overcome if results from a standardized AFM method could be correlated with SPR results for a similar set of peptide-surface interactions so that AFM studies using the standardized method could be extended to characterize peptide-surface interactions for surfaces that are not amenable for characterization by SPR. In this article, we present the development and application of an AFM method to measure adsorption forces for host guest peptides sequence on surfaces consisting of alkanethiol self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) with different functionality. The results from these studies show that a linear correlation exists between these data and the adsorption free energy (Delta G(ads)(o)) values associated with a similar set of peptide-surface systems available from SPR measurements. These methods will be extremely useful to characterize thermodynamically the adsorption behavior for peptides on a much broader range of surfaces than can be used with SPR to provide information related to understanding protein adsorption behavior to these surfaces and to provide an experimental database that can be used for the evaluation, modification, and validation of force field parameters that are needed to represent protein adsorption behavior accurately for molecular simulations.									30	1	0	11	0	30			0743-7463			WOS:000285217700039	21073182	
J	Shin, Sangmun; Kongsuwon, Pauline; Cho, Byung Rae								Development of the parametric tolerance modeling and optimization schemes and cost-effective solutions								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH				207	3			1728	1741		10.1016/j.ejor.2010.07.009			DEC 16 2010	2010	Most of previous research on tolerance optimization seeks the optimal tolerance allocation with process parameters such as fixed process mean and variance. This research, however, differs from the previous studies in two ways. First, an integrated optimization scheme is proposed to determine both the optimal settings of those process parameters and the optimal tolerance simultaneously which is called a parametric tolerance optimization problem in this paper. Second, most tolerance optimization models require rigorous optimization processes using numerical methods, since closed-form solutions are rarely found. This paper shows how the Lambert W function, which is often used in physics, can be applied efficiently to this parametric tolerance optimization problem. By using the Lambert W function, one can express the optimal solutions to the parametric tolerance optimization problem in a closed-form without resorting to numerical methods. For verification purposes, numerical examples for three cases are conducted and sensitivity analyses are performed. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

It was found in this study that the defects in nanotubes could be decorated by an inorganic salt, which augmented the passivation effect of organic functionalization to result in dramatically enhanced emission intensities under both one-and two-photon excitation conditions. The structures and properties of the functionalized carbon nanotubes with inorganic coating were thoroughly characterized by using spectroscopy and microscopy techniques. The fluorescence decoration with the coating may serve as a tool in the study of surface defects in carbon nanotubes, and these brightly fluorescent pseudo-one-dimensional nanomaterials may be exploited for optical applications.									14	0	0	1	0	14			1932-7447			WOS:000284990800004		
J	Wang, Xi; Tong, Huarong; Chen, Feng; Gangemi, J. David								Chemical characterization and antioxidant evaluation of muscadine grape pomace extract								FOOD CHEMISTRY				123	4			1156	1162		10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.05.080			DEC 15 2010	2010	Concentrated muscadine pomace extract was chromatographically analyzed for its individual phenolic, flavonoid, and anthocyanidin compounds. This extract was also characterized regarding its total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), antioxidative activities in terms of scavenging DPPH free radicals, reducing ferric, and chelating Fe(2+). The TPC of this product was 34.1 +/- 1.8 mg of gallic acid equivalents(GAE)/g of extract, and TFC was 3.0 +/- 0.3 mg of quercetin equivalents/g of extract. Some phenolic compounds including ellagic acid, gallic acid, (-)-epicatechin, (-)-epigallocatechin, catechin, myricetin, quercetin, and kaempferol were identified. Some anthocyanidins including delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, peonidin, and malvidin were also identified in the extract by using a combination of retention and spectral properties on a reverse-phase HPLC-PDA. In addition, 3,3',4,4'5,5'-hexahydroxystilbene-a resveratrol analogue present in the extract was identified for the first time by LC-MS. The results from this study demonstrate that the muscadine pomace extract is rich of natural antioxidants such as phenolics, flavonoids and anthocyanins, and possesses strong antioxidant properties. Besides, the developed methods can be used for routine quality control of the muscadine products for manufacturing efficiency and consistency.

The crystal structure shows a single [15] aneS(5) macrocycle and a chloro ligand coordinated in a distorted octahedral fashion around the ruthenium(II) center. A significant shortening (0.15 angstrom) of the trans Ru-S bond length occurs in this complex compared to the related PPh3 complex (2.4458(10) to 2.283(1) angstrom) due to the differences in the trans influence of the two ligands. C-13 NMR spectroscopy demonstrates that the structure of [Ru([15]aneS(5))Cl](+) is retained in solution. As expected for a Ru(II) complex, the electronic absorption spectrum shows two d-d transitions at 402 and 331 nm. These are red-shifted compared to hexakis(thioether) ruthenium(II) complexes and consistent with the weaker ligand field effect of the chloro ligand. The electrochemical behavior of the complex in acetonitrile shows a single one-electron reversible oxidation-reduction at +0.722 V versus Fc/Fc(+) which is assigned as the Ru(II)/Ru(III) couple. DFT calculations for [Ru([15]aneS(5))Cl](+) show a HOMO with orbital contributions from a t(2g) type orbital of the Ru ion, a pi component from a p orbital of the axial S atom of [15] aneS(5), and a p orbital of the chloro ligand while the LUMO consists of orbital contributions of d(x2-y2) orbital of the Ru center and p orbitals of the four equatorial S donors.

High temperature Seebeck coefficient metrology								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS				108	12					121101	10.1063/1.3503505			DEC 15 2010	2010	We present an overview of the challenges and practices of thermoelectric metrology on bulk materials at high temperature (300 to 1300 K). The Seebeck coefficient, when combined with thermal and electrical conductivity, is an essential property measurement for evaluating the potential performance of novel thermoelectric materials. However, there is some question as to which measurement technique (s) provides the most accurate determination of the Seebeck coefficient at high temperature. This has led to the implementation of nonideal practices that have further complicated the confirmation of reported high ZT materials. To ensure meaningful interlaboratory comparison of data, thermoelectric measurements must be reliable, accurate, and consistent. This article will summarize and compare the relevant measurement techniques and apparatus designs required to effectively manage uncertainty, while also providing a reference resource of previous advances in high temperature thermoelectric metrology.

The effect of various denier capillary channel polymer fibers on the alignment of NHDF cells and type I collagen								JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS RESEARCH PART A				95A	4			1194	1202		10.1002/jbm.a.32941			DEC 15 2010	2010	If tissue engineers are to successfully repair and regenerate native tendons and ligaments, it will be essential to implement contact guidance to induce cellular and type I collagen alignment to replicate the native structure. Capillary channel polymer (CC-P) fibers fabricated by melt-extrusion have aligned micrometer scale surface channels that may serve the goal of achieving biomimetic, physical templates for ligament growth and regeneration. Previous work characterizing the behavior of normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF), on the 19 denier per filament (dpf) CC-P fibers, demonstrated a need for improved cellular and type I collagen alignment. Therefore, 5 and 9 dpf CC-P fibers were manufactured to determine whether their channel dimensions would achieve greater alignment. A 29 dpf CC-P fiber was also examined to determine whether cellular guidance could still be achieved within the larger dimensions of the fiber's channels. The 9 dpf CC-P fiber appeared to approach the topographical constraints necessary to induce the cellular and type I collagen architecture that most closely mirrored that of native ACL tissue. This work demonstrated that the novel cross-section of the CC-P fiber geometry could approach the necessary surface topography to align NHDF cells along the longitudinal axis of each fiber.

A connection is then established between the formulations for graddiv stabilized Taylor-Hood elements: under mild restrictions, the formulations' velocity solutions converge to each other (and to the Scott-Vogelius solution) as the stabilization parameter tends to infinity. Thus the benefits of using Scott-Vogelius elements can be obtained with the less expensive Taylor-Hood elements, and moreover the benefits of all the formulations can be retained if the rotational formulation is used. Numerical examples are provided that confirm the theory. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0021-9991			WOS:000283901700002

The key to the quantum topological order is the coexistence of spin-orbit coupling with proximity-induced s-wave superconductivity and an externally induced Zeeman coupling of the spins. For the Zeeman coupling below a critical value, the system is a nontopological (proximity-induced) s-wave superconductor. However, for a range of Zeeman coupling above the critical value, the lowest energy excited state inside a vortex is a zero-energy Majorana fermion state. The system, thus, has entered into a non-Abelian s-wave superconducting state via a topological quantum phase transition (TQPT) tuned by the Zeeman coupling. In the topological phase, since the time-reversal symmetry is explicitly broken by the Zeeman term in the Hamiltonian, the edge of the film constitutes a chiral Majorana wire. Just like the s-wave superconductivity, the Zeeman coupling can also be proximity induced in the film by an adjacent magnetic insulator. We show this by an explicit model tight-binding calculation for both types of proximity effects in the heterostructure geometry. Here we show that the same TQPT can be accessed by varying the interface transparency between the film and the superconductor. For the transparency below (above) a critical value, the system is a topological (regular) s-wave superconductor. In the one-dimensional version of the same structure and for the Zeeman coupling above the critical value, there are localized Majorana zero-energy modes at the two ends of a semiconducting quantum nanowire. In this case, the Zeeman coupling can be induced more easily by an external magnetic field parallel to the wire, obviating the need for a magnetic insulator. We show that, despite the fact that the superconducting pair potential in the nanowire is explicitly s wave, tunneling of electrons to the ends of the wire reveals a pronounced zero-bias peak. Such a peak is absent when the Zeeman coupling is below its critical value, i.e., the nanowire is in the nontopological s-wave superconducting state. We argue that the observation of this zero-bias tunneling peak in the semiconductor nanowire is possibly the simplest and clearest experiment proposed so far to unambiguously detect a Majorana fermion mode in a condensed-matter system.									210	4	0	2	0	211			2469-9950	2469-9969		WOS:000286744900002

There is thus a need for a numerical model that encompasses the whole atmosphere and can self-consistently simulate the dynamic, physical, chemical, radiative, and electrodynamic processes that are important for the Sun-Earth system. This is the goal for developing the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM). In this work, we report the development and preliminary validation of the thermospheric extension of WACCM (WACCM-X), which extends from the Earth's surface to the upper thermosphere. The WACCM-X uses the finite volume dynamical core from the NCAR Community Atmosphere Model and includes an interactive chemistry module resolving most known neutral chemistry and major ion chemistry in the middle and upper atmosphere, and photolysis and photoionization. Upper atmosphere processes, such as nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium, radiative transfer, auroral processes, ion drag, and molecular diffusion of major and minor species, have been included in the model. We evaluate the model performance by examining the quantities essential for the climate and weather of the upper atmosphere: the mean compositional, thermal, and wind structures from the troposphere to the upper thermosphere and their variability on interannual, seasonal, and daily scales. These quantities are compared with observational and previous model results.									56	0	0	0	0	56			2169-9380	2169-9402		WOS:000285020000008

Long C-C bonds with large pyramidalization angles lead to the most stable adducts, the [5,6] bonds in the adjacent pentagon pair being especially favored. The lesser regioselectivity observed for Gd3N@C-82 is probably due to the activation of some C-C bonds by means of the metal cluster.									26	0	0	2	0	26			0022-3263			WOS:000284519900036	21058722

Perennial Ryegrass Allelopathic Potential on Bermudagrass Germination and Seedling Growth								HORTSCIENCE				45	12			1872	1875					DEC 2010	2010	Overseeded perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) aggressively competes with bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.] for resources and may adversely affect spring transition by releasing allelochemicals into the environment. Growth chamber studies examined germination and growth of 'Arizona Common' bermudagrass in soil amended with 0%, 2%, 12%, or 23% perennial ryegrass root or shoot debris or in soil treated with irrigation water in which perennial ryegrass roots at 0, 5, 10, or 20 g center dot L(-1) or shoots at 0, 10, or 20 g center dot L(-1) had been soaked. Inhibitory effects on bermudagrass germination and growth were most extensive when soil was amended with ryegrass shoot debris, because germination, root ash weight, root length density, and root mass density were reduced 33%, 55%, 30%, and 52%, respectively. Soil amended with ryegrass root debris only inhibited bermudagrass-specific root length. Application of irrigation water containing either ryegrass root or shoot extracts only inhibited bermudagrass-specific root length. In conclusion, results obtained when soil was amended with shoot debris demonstrated perennial ryegrass can inhibit bermudagrass germination and growth in controlled environments.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0018-5345			WOS:000285371800019		
J	Campbell, Robert L.; Eisner, Sarah; Riggs, Nicole								Sources of self-esteem: From theory to measurement and back again								NEW IDEAS IN PSYCHOLOGY				28	3			338	349		10.1016/j.newideapsych.2009.09.008			DEC 2010	2010	According to some conceptions, self-esteem possesses a moral dimension; according to others, it does not. According to some, the realism of the self-evaluation matters; according to others, it does not. For some investigators, narcissism is just high self-esteem; for others, narcissism involves internal conflicts within one's self-evaluation, which is strongly dependent on admiration extracted from other people. The best known procedure for measuring self-esteem has been a 10 question survey introduced by Rosenberg in 1965. Along with other insensitivities and biases, the Rosenberg scale fails to respond to the different high-level values or "sources" that are constitutive of self-esteem for different individuals. A person's self-esteem can be contingent on internal sources (such as independent thinking, productive projects, and moral commitments), or on external sources (such as fame, wealth, physical appearance, or the approval of peers). A study reported here investigated the relationships among global explicit self-esteem (as assessed with the Rosenberg scale), reliance on internal sources of self-esteem (measured with the Self-Esteem Sentence Completion Instrument), reliance on several external sources (via the External Sources of Self-Esteem scale), and narcissistic tendencies (as per the Narcissistic Personality Inventory). The participants were 97 undergraduate college students enrolled in psychology courses. Rosenberg and NPI scores displayed different patterns of correlation with various subscales of the ESOSES, raising the prospect that profiles of various external sources will enable us to differentiate between self-esteem and narcissism. Meanwhile, scores on the SESCI were not significantly related to any other variable, except for a mild negative correlation with the success recognition subscale of the ESOSES-an outcome that raises both theoretical and measurement questions about internal sources. Contrary to frequent assumptions of direct rivalry, reliance on internal sources of self-esteem may be largely independent of reliance on external sources. At the same time, however, more work obviously needs to be done on measuring internal sources of self-esteem, both explicit and implicit. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

DIFFERENTIATION OF MELOIDOGYNE SPECIES WITH FAME ANALYSIS								NEMATROPICA				40	2			163	175					DEC 2010	2010	Sekora, N. S., K. S. Lawrence, P. Agudelo, E. van Santen, and J. A. McInroy. 2010. Differentiation of Meloidogyne species with FAME analysis. Nematropica 40:163-175. Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis can be used as a means for differentiating among plant-parasitic nematode genera. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of this system to identify species and races within a single genus. Fatty acids were extracted and analyzed from samples containing 1000 individuals each of Meloidogyne arenaria (race 2), M. hapla, M. incognita (races 1, 2, and 3), and M. javanica. The resulting profiles generated by the Sherlock (R) Analysis Software were then statistically analyzed with SAS version 9.1.3. The profiles of each Meloidogyne species and race were significantly different. The four Meloidogyne species separated with a minimum squared Mahalanobis distance (D(2)) between M. incognita and M. arenaria (D(2) = 15.9, P < 0.0001). D(2) values among M. incognita races were all significant at P < 0.0001 with a minimum distance between M. incognita race 1 and M. incognita race 2 of 17.5. When separating three Meloidogyne species and three M. incognita races, the minimum distance lied between M. arenaria and M. incognita race 1 (D(2) = 15.7, P < 0.0001). By incorporating these profiles into a Sherlock (R) Analysis Software library, the FAME method can be used to distinguish among four Meloidogyne species to provide an alternative source of identification.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0099-5444			WOS:000288494500002

Parental Attendance and Brood Success in American Oystercatchers in South Carolina								WATERBIRDS				33	4			511	517		10.1675/063.033.0410			DEC 2010	2010	Research on breeding American Oystercatchers has focused on identifying factors that affect reproductive success but little attention has been paid to parent behavior during chick-rearing. Parental attendance of American Oystercatchers was measured in Bulls Bay and along the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway (Waterway) within the Cape Romain Region, South Carolina, USA, during 2006. Parental attendance rates averaged 90.9% in Bulls Bay and 81.4% along the Waterway. Daily survival of chicks was higher in Bulls Bay (0.989 +/- 0.007) compared to the Waterway (0.966 +/- 0.012). The extent of shellfish reefs (i.e. foraging areas) adjacent to nest sites was greater in Bulls Bay (5,633 +/- 658 m(2)) compared to the Waterway (3,273 +/- 850 m(2)). Mean parental attendance in Bulls Bay was higher for successful broods (90.5%) compared to failed broods (79.8%). In contrast, mean parental attendance along the Waterway was higher for failed broods (93.4%) compared to successful broods (67.5%). Less extensive shellfish reefs adjacent to nest sites along the Waterway appeared to require parents to depart more frequently to forage and the resultant reduction in attendance may have negatively affected cluck survival. Bulls Bay may provide higher quality nesting habitat compared to the Waterway with respect to proximity to food resources and parental attendance. Management and conservation efforts for American Oystercatchers should consider the relationship between foraging and nesting habitat and variability in behavioral attributes, such as parental attendance, in relationship to environmental conditions which ultimately affect reproductive success.

Relative importance of criteria in multiobjective programming: A cone-based approach								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH				207	2			936	945		10.1016/j.ejor.2010.06.008			DEC 1 2010	2010	This article develops a convex polyhedral cone-based preference modeling framework for decision making with multiple criteria which extends the classical notion of Pareto optimality and accounts for relative importance of the criteria. The decision maker's perception of the relative importance is quantified by an allowable tradeoffs between two objectives representing the maximum allowable amount of decay of a less important objective per one unit of improvement of a more important objective. Two cone-based models of relative importance are developed. In the first model, one criterion is designated as less important while all the others are more important. In the second model, more than one criterion may be classified as less important while all the others are considered more important. Complete algebraic characterization of the models is derived and the relationship between them and the classical Pareto preference is examined. Their relevance to decision making is discussed.

In this work, the scintillation response of LaF3:Eu nanoparticles is reported. Core/multi-shell nanoparticles were prepared using a modified solution precipitation method that takes advantage of the organic ligand ammonium di-n-octadecyldithiophosphate (ADDP) to simultaneously achieve shelling of doped core nanoparticles while avoiding agglomeration. Nanoparticles were characterized on their structure, morphology, luminescence, and scintillation behavior by means of X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, photoluminescence, and radioluminescence (RI) measurements, respectively. Analysis of the scintillation process revealed that the unique aspect of scintillation in nanoparticles when compared to bulk materials is related to the migration of carriers within the nanoparticle. Cladding of the Eu-doped core with an undoped shell was found to increase scintillation intensity by a factor of 3, and further shelling leads to a continuous decrease in RL intensity. Surface passivation, together with the decreasing probability of radiative recombination of carriers at the luminescent centers in the core with increasing number of shells grown around the core are suggested to describe the observed RL intensity behavior. Scintillation enhancement by means of shelling is a promising pathway to enhance the use of scintillator nanoparticles in detection devices. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Quantile Regression Estimates of Confidence Intervals for WASDE Price Forecasts								JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMICS				35	3			545	567					DEC 2010	2010	This study uses quantile regressions to estimate historical forecast error distributions for WASDE forecasts of corn, soybean, and wheat prices, and then compute confidence limits for the forecasts based on the empirical distributions. Quantile regressions with fit errors expressed as a function of forecast lead time are consistent with theoretical forecast variance expressions while avoiding assumptions of normality and optimality. Based on out-of-sample accuracy tests over 1995/96-2006/07, quantile regression methods produced intervals consistent with the target confidence level. Overall, this study demonstrates that empirical approaches may be used to construct accurate confidence intervals for WASDE corn, soybean, and wheat price forecasts.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1068-5502			WOS:000285737800012

APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY AND PRACTICAL BIOREACTORS FOR PLANT PROPAGATION								PROPAGATION OF ORNAMENTAL PLANTS				10	4			205	219					DEC 2010	2010	Bioreactors are mechanical in vitro systems that allow optimal air, water and solutes availability. Shoot systems developed during micropropagation usually require stationary gaseous phase to grow normally. Intermittent immersion of plantlets in liquid medium, by varied mechanical designs, produced superior growth, when compared to agar-gelled systems. We presented data from our laboratory to demonstrate reasons why plantlets in liquid grow faster and larger than agar that included: 1) greater water availability, 2) greater solute transfer within the medium, 3) larger surface areas for solutes transfer from medium to plantlet, and 4) the ability to use higher solute concentrations due to greater water availability. Improved labor efficiency in micropropagation was also realized by faster, non-oriented transfer of plantlets during subculture and the ease of removing medium when planting out in greenhouse. Larger vessels of liquid allow plantlets to get larger, than with agar, and using growth retardants or high osmotic medium controls plantlet size and further increases system efficiency. In a single operation batch process, solutes such as sucrose or phosphorus, may not be in adequate amounts at the onset of a culture cycle to maintain prolonged growth. Supplementing medium during the culture cycle allow plantlets to attain more mature status, such as the formation of storage organs in geophytes. This review featured two bioreactors, the Liquid Lab Rocker and the Artificial Plant Ovary, that allow medium supplementation and multi-functional process development. For bioreactors to be successfully deployed, their cost needs to be offset by labor savings in transfer time and greater numbers of better developed plantlets that accrue more value in the market.									11	0	0	8	0	11			1311-9109			WOS:000286789500006

Bivariate tests and analysis of covariance models indicated greater levels of national pride among black males, older respondents, those who classified themselves as republicans and those with lower levels of formal education. Exposure to newspapers and television did not prove statistically significant in multivariate analyses, although bivariate tests revealed that those exposed most frequently to television tended to agree in significantly higher numbers with the statement 'When my country does well in international sports, it makes me proud to be an American.'

Photoluminescence emission and excitation spectra were obtained for comparison with TL and radioluminescence (RL) emission bands. We then compared the structure and intensity of TL curves, RL intensity, and afterglow at room temperature and investigated the trapped charge stability (revealed by TL). The results showed that the SCS technique is capable of producing scintillating materials with less afterglow and RL output comparable to single crystals. The nanophosphor samples also showed lower TL intensities than their single crystal counterparts, which points to a lower concentration of trapping centers. These results demonstrate the potential of nanophosphors produced by SCS for use as scintillators. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A dynamic population model is used to estimate future patterns (both prevalence and consumption) of tobacco use in Vietnam, with and without changes to tobacco excise for the period 2006-2016. Three increases in the base case excise tax rate of 55% are modelled: 65%, 75% and 90%. Various price elasticities are used to examine variations in cigarette consumption while cross price elasticities are used to explore shifts from cigarette to other forms of tobacco. Revenue implications for the period 20062016 are reported as discounted net present values (NPV) in 2006 values. The model predicts that smoking rates in 2016, for both males and females, are marginally lower than base case estimates for all taxation excise options with higher price elasticities generating greater reductions in prevalence. In all cases, compared to base case estimates, the results indicate a fall in number of smokers, a reduction in amount of tobacco consumed and an increase in overall taxation revenue. The additional gain in government revenue, expressed in NPV terms, ranges from a low of VND 69,579 billion (or USD $4.35 billion) to a high of VND 108,492 billion (or USD $6.79 billion). Increases in tobacco excise provide an opportunity for the Vietnamese government to increase revenue at the same time as reducing tobacco consumption. Further research into the wider social and economic consequences of increasing tobacco excise in Vietnam is warranted. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

First published October 6, 2010; doi: 10.1152/ajprenal.00183.2010.-Recently, the use of overexpression of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) has led to the generation of immortalized human cell lines. However, this cell immortalization approach has not been reported in well-differentiated mouse cells, such as renal epithelial cells. We sought to establish and then characterize a mouse collecting duct cell line, using ectopic expression of mTERT. Isolated primary cortical collecting duct (CCD) cell lines were transduced with mouse (m) TERT, using a lentiviral vector. mTERT-negative cells did not survive blasticidin selection, whereas mTERT-immortalized cells proliferated in selection media for over 40 subpassages. mTERT messenger RNA and telomerase activity was elevated in these cells, compared with an SV40-immortalized cell line. Flow cytometry with Dolichos biflorus agglutinin was used to select the CCD principal cells, and we designated this cell line mTERT-CCD. Cells were well differentiated and exhibited morphological characteristics typically found in renal epithelial cells, such as tight junction formation, microvilli, and primary cilia. Further characterization using standard immunofluorescence revealed abundant expression of aquaporin-2 and the vasopressin type 2 receptor. mTERT-CCD cells exhibited cAMP-stimulated/benzamil-inhibited whole cell currents. Whole cell patch-clamp currents were also enhanced after a 6-day treatment with aldosterone. In conclusion, we have successfully used mTERT to immortalize mouse collecting duct cells that retain the basic in vivo phenotypic characteristics of collecting duct cells. This technique should be valuable in generating cell lines from genetically engineered mouse models.									5	0	0	4	0	5			1931-857X			WOS:000285084700031	20926633

With certain physically reasonable assumptions, the governing equations for the thermal analyses are derived. An approach combining unstructured-finite-volume [1] and finite difference methods is applied to solve the governing equations, in which the soil domain was discretized by unstructured grids. Numerical simulations in a wide range of operating conditions are conducted. The operating conditions cover 5 months (April, May, June, October and November) with throughputs ranging from 15,007 tons per day to 27,451 tons per day and outlet temperatures varying from 40.6 degrees C to 64.8 degrees C. Measured data are provided for comparison. A good agreement between numerical simulations and field measurement suggests that the proposed numerical scheme is a suitable method to simulate the heat transfer and oil flow of buried hot crude oil pipelines. We also analyze a number of influential factors on the temperature distribution of oil along the pipeline. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Higham, Timothy E.; Russell, Anthony P.								Divergence in locomotor performance, ecology, and morphology between two sympatric sister species of desert-dwelling gecko								BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY				101	4			860	869		10.1111/j.1095-8312.2010.01539.x			DEC 2010	2010	The functional and evolutionary implications of morphological diversification have been addressed for several groups of vertebrates. Although the mechanisms of gecko adhesion have received considerable attention, little is known regarding locomotor performance of geckos in nature, and how this might relate to morphological diversity. In this study we examine locomotor performance of two sympatric sister species of geckos of the genus Rhoptropus (Rhoptropus afer and Rhoptropus bradfieldi) found in the coastal desert regions of Namibia. One species (R. afer) commonly runs on sandy substrates and moves between isolated rock sheets, whereas the other species (R. bradfieldi) commonly lives and runs on isolated boulders. The morphology of R. afer is extremely divergent from its sister species and all other species in the genus. We initially recorded the inclination of the substrate in which the lizards were found in order to characterize the habitat of each species. We then quantified maximum speed and acceleration on a level 1-m trackway, and also during escapes in the field. We found that R. bradfieldi occupies steeper surfaces than those occupied by R. afer. On the trackway and in nature, R. afer runs faster than R. bradfieldi, although the differences in locomotor performance between the species are greater for the field measurements. Rhoptropus afer commonly runs for more than 2 or 3 m, whereas R. bradfieldi commonly runs less than 50 cm during an escape sprint. Our main conclusions are that: (1) R. afer attains higher maximum speeds when escaping under controlled and field conditions, although the magnitude differs between conditions; and (2) hindlimb morphology correlates with maximum running speed in R. afer, but not in R. bradfieldi. Similar to the well-studied Anolis lizards, we propose that these two gecko species represent distinct and highly divergent ecomorphs.

Concentrating cells is often required in order to acquire adequate cells for lysis. This work presents an integrated concentration and lysis of mammalian cells in a constriction microchannel using dc-biased ac electric fields. By adjusting the dc component, the electrokinetic cell motion can be precisely controlled, leading to an easy switch between concentration and lysis of red blood cells in the channel constriction. These two operations are also used in conjunction to demonstrate a continuous concentration and separation of leukemia cells from red blood cells in the same microchannel. The observed cell behaviors agree reasonably with the simulation results. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

Predicting siRNA potency with random forests and support vector machines								BMC GENOMICS				11						S2	10.1186/1471-2164-11-S3-S2		3	DEC 1 2010	2010	Background: Short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) can be used to knockdown gene expression in functional genomics. For a target gene of interest, many siRNA molecules may be designed, whereas their efficiency of expression inhibition often varies.Results: To facilitate gene functional studies, we have developed a new machine learning method to predict siRNA potency based on random forests and support vector machines. Since there were many potential sequence features, random forests were used to select the most relevant features affecting gene expression inhibition. Support vector machine classifiers were then constructed using the selected sequence features for predicting siRNA potency. Interestingly, gene expression inhibition is significantly affected by nucleotide dimer and trimer compositions of siRNA sequence.Conclusions: The findings in this study should help design potent siRNAs for functional genomics, and might also provide further insights into the molecular mechanism of RNA interference.									10	0	0	10	0	11			1471-2164			WOS:000289200400003	21143784

Development, characterization, and technical applications of a fish lysozyme-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb M24-2)								COMPARATIVE IMMUNOLOGY MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES				33	6			E15	E23		10.1016/j.cimid.2009.10.002			DEC 2010	2010	Lysozyme is one of several humoral and cellular factors associated with front line, innate immunity in all vertebrates. Historically, circulating lysozyme has been quantified in teleosts by measuring enzymatic activity against heat-killed Mycococcus lysodieticus using whole serum or plasma at a low pH. However, the amount of serum or plasma required for standard lysozyme activity exceeds that which can be easily acquired from small fish, thus making lysozyme a difficult endpoint to measure in limited sample volumes. Moreover, while circulating lysozyme is considered to be an indicator of proinflammatory phagocyte activity, the cellular source of this protein is not easily detected in fish. While several antibodies against lysozyme are commercially available for use in higher vertebrates, neither reacts with lysozyme in fish. In this study, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) for detecting and quantifying lysozyme was developed from mummichog, Fundulus heteroclitus, myeloid cells that also recognizes hen egg lysozyme (HEL), then tested for cross-reactivity in different species of teleosts. A single protein of approximate to 14-15 kDa mass was identified by the mAb in fish cell lysates and plasma samples, as well as denatured HEL. Total circulating lysozyme protein was compared to lysozyme activity using standard ELISA procedures and was found to correlate with enzymatic activity. Using mAb M24-2, intracellular lysozyme protein was detected in formalin-fixed and permeabilized lymphoid cells adhered to glass cover slips. Moreover, mAb M24-2 localizes lysozyme to myeloid cells. Finally, it was demonstrated that mAb M24-2 is suitable for immunohistochemistry in that lysozyme could be detected in plastic-embedded lymphoid tissues. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The binary nature of the problems can potentially lead to a significant reduction in the number of view angles required for a satisfactory reconstruction, thusly enabling many interesting applications. However, the limited view angles result in a severely underdetermined system of equations, which is challenging to solve. Various approaches have been proposed to address such a challenge, and two categories of approaches include those based on optimization and those based on algebraic iteration. However, the relative strengths, limitations, and applicable ranges of these approaches have not been clearly defined in the past. Therefore, it is the main objective of this work to conduct a systematic comparison of approaches from each category. This comparison suggested that the approaches based on algebraic iteration offered both superior reconstruction fidelity and computation efficiency at low (two or three) view angles, and these advantages diminished at high view angles. Meanwhile, this work also investigated the application of regularization techniques, the selection of optimal regularization parameter, and the use of a local search technique for binary problems. We expect the results and conclusions reported in this work to provide valuable guidance for the design and development of algorithms for binary tomography problems. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Spatial Distribution of the Cereal Leaf Beetle (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) in Wheat								ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY				39	6			1943	1952		10.1603/EN10058			DEC 2010	2010	A 2-yr study was conducted in wheat fields in South Carolina involving weekly sampling of cereal leaf beetle, Oulema melanopus (L.). In each of the six fields of this study, temporal patterns showed two distinct peaks in March and in May of adult O. melanopus. Populations decreased as wheat plants matured. In 2009, larval populations had one peak in April in between the two adult peaks. The chi(2) statistics for observed and Poisson predicted distributions of O. melanopus indicated nonrandom distribution for adults and larvae. In addition, the values of I(D) were >1 for adults and larvae in both years across sampling dates. These results indicate that the sampling distributions of both adult and larval populations of O. melanopus were aggregated. Slopes of Taylor power's law (b) and patchiness regressions (beta) were significantly (P < O.05) different than one in all cases, except for b in 2008 for adults. Across sampling dates, the distance from field border had a significant effect on adult O. melanopus in both years, but not on larval O. melanopus. Densities of adult O. melanapus were greatest at 0 m (the field edge), and decreased at 5-25 m from the field edge. The inverted distance weighted interpolation method showed considerable levels of spatial variability in densities within fields. High densities along the edge of wheat fields suggests that localized control methods in wheat may be effective in reducing migration of O. melanopus and damage in corn, Zea mays L.									13	0	0	13	0	13			0046-225X			WOS:000286125700029	22182561

A general two-constraint model of consumer demand								EUROPEAN REVIEW OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS				37	4			433	452		10.1093/erae/jbq034			DEC 2010	2010	We generalise a two-constraint model of consumer demand so as to make utility a function of both consumption of the good and the time allocated to consumption, to accommodate the fact that the consumer may derive utility from the time spent acquiring and/or consuming the good. We use the comparative static results to specify demand systems consistent with this theory and develop an econometric approach to estimate the demand parameters. The model is used to obtain empirical demand functions for customers visiting pick-your-own fruit farms, where customers choose between harvesting fruit themselves and buying pre-harvested fruit on the farm.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0165-1587			WOS:000284636300001

Consistent with the theory that firms issue equity when stock is overvalued, we document a surge in informed exercise in the months surrounding the SEO. From six months prior to the announcement date to six months after issuance, an average 1.76% of the total market capitalization for issuing firms is exercised and sold. Interestingly, we find a positive association between informed option exercises and long-run performance. Overall, our collective evidence indicates that insiders are not particularly good at timing exercises around SEOs.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0046-3892			WOS:000285008500012

A NOVEL TECHNIQUE FOR FEEDING AND CONFIRMING UPTAKE OF BACTERIA IN LARVAE OF THE SOUTHERN HOUSE MOSQUITO, CULEX QUINQUEFASCIATUS (DIPTERA: CULICIDAE)								FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST				93	4			577	583					DEC 2010	2010	Aquatic macroinvertebrates play important roles in freshwater ecosystems. The larvae of the vector mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae) primarily reside in standing water rich in organic matter; these conditions are also suited for growth of microbial biofilms. As microbes serve as a food source for larvae, the study of interactions between microbial biofilms and C. quinquefasciatus can aid in understanding the routes by which aquatic larvae can acquire pathogens, and the role such larvae may play in environmental persistence of microorganisms. Studies in butterflies, nematodes, and ticks have described interactions with bacteria acquired by the oral route, including arthropods that play a role in dissemination of bacteria on beet plants. In pursuit of these goals, this manuscript describes a new protocol for investigating larval mosquito feeding on microbial biofilms. Fluorescent microscopy and GFP expressing bacterial strains were used to show larval acquisition and midgut localization of bacteria from both planktonic and biofilm sources. PCR testing for the GFP plasmid confirmed presence of the test strain in fed larvae. The results of microscopy and PCR assays demonstrate that Culex quinquefasciatus larvae will feed on microbial biofilms in a laboratory environment. The efficiency of studying microbial fate through common microscopic and molecular techniques, in combination with an easily maintained vector insect colony, means this approach can be used to investigate a multitude of research questions relating to microbial effects on larval physiology, fitness, and conditioning.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0015-4040			WOS:000285178200016

The method uses conditional sampling to select instantaneous fully resolved local scalar fields, which are analyzed to determine the measurement noise and to correct the Favre mean, conditional, and conditionally filtered dissipation rates. The potentially under-resolved local scalar fields, also selected using conditional sampling, are corrected for noise and are analyzed to examine the extent of resolution. The error function is used as a model for the potentially under-resolved local scalar to evaluate the scalar dissipation length scales and the percentage of the dissipation resolved. The results show that the Favre mean dissipation rate, the mean dissipation rate conditional on the mixture fraction, and dissipation rate filtered conditionally on the mixture fraction generally are well resolved in the flames. Analyses of the dissipation rates filtered conditionally on the mixture fraction and temperature show that the length scale increases with temperature, due to lower dissipation rate and higher diffusivity. The dissipation rate is well resolved for temperatures above 1,300 K but is less resolved at lower temperatures, although the probability of very low temperature events is low. To fully resolve these rare events the sample spacing needs to be reduced by approximately one half. The present study further demonstrates the effectiveness of the new noise correction and length scale estimation method.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1386-6184			WOS:000283943000004

The presence of bacteria on banknotes was found to be influenced by the material of the notes, and there was a strong correlation between the number of bacteria per square centimeter and a series of indicators of economic prosperity of the various countries. The strongest correlation was found with the "index of economic freedom," indicating that the lower the index value, the higher the typical bacterial content on the banknotes in circulation. Other factors that appear to influence the number of bacteria on banknotes were the age of the banknotes and the material used to produce the notes (polymer-based vs. cotton-based). The banknotes were also screened for the presence of a range of pathogens. It was found that pathogens could only be isolated after enrichment and their mere presence does not appear to be alarming. In light of our international findings, it is recommended that current guidelines as they apply in most countries with regard to the concurrent hygienic handling of foods and money should be universally adopted. This includes that, in some instances, the handling of food and money have to be physically separated by employing separate individuals to carry out one task each; whereas in other instances, it could be advantageous to handle food only with a gloved hand and money with the other hand. If neither of these precautions can be effectively implemented, it is highly recommended that food service personnel practice proper hand washing procedures after handling money and before handling food.									11	0	0	4	0	11			1535-3141			WOS:000284837300008	20704502

Utilizing data from the 1999 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty, I find that (1) women faculty members prefer to spend a greater percentage of their time on teaching, while men prefer to spend more time on research, although these preferences are themselves constrained; (2) women faculty members spend a greater percentage of their workweek on teaching and a smaller percentage on research than men, gaps that cannot be explained by preferences or educational and institutional attributes; and (3) women faculty members have larger time allocation mismatches than men-that is, their actual time allocations to both teaching and research diverge more from their preferred time allocations than those of men. These findings shed light on how gender inequality is both produced and maintained in this aspect of academic employment and have implications for job satisfaction, productivity, and the recruitment and retention of current and future faculty members, especially women.									22	0	0	1	0	22			0891-2432			WOS:000284849100003

The detector utilizes the nonlinear characteristics of short-channel MOS devices operating in either a saturation or subthreshold regime to generate a dc current that is proportional to the input RF signal power. The operating regimes of MOS devices depend on input RF power levels. A quasi-T-coil matching network providing 50-Omega matching from 0.5 to 20 GHz is designed and analyzed. An embedded amplifier is added to enhance the sensitivity of the PD when the input power level is low. The circuit that is implemented in a 0.13-mu m CMOS process occupies an active area of 0.085 mm(2). In the matched frequency range, the measured input dynamic range is 47 dB with an overall sensitivity of 26.8 mV/dB. The output dc voltage response is nearly frequency-independent in the linear operating range, varying by less than 1.9 dB for a given input RF power level, as the RF frequency is swept across the operating frequency range. With a standard 1.2-V supply, the static power consumption is about 0.1 mW, which decreases to 2 x 10(-4) mW with a 0.5-V supply, while the operating frequency remains unchanged.									12	0	0	0	0	12			0018-9456	1557-9662		WOS:000284076000024

This framework uses an in-vehicle intelligent module, based on a support vector machine (SVM), to determine the vehicle's travel experiences with autonomously generated kinetics data. Roadside infrastructure agents (also known as RSUs: roadside units) detect the incident by compiling travel experiences from several vehicles and comparing the aggregated results with the pre-selected threshold values. The authors developed this VII-SVM incident detection system on a previously calibrated and validated simulation network in rural Spartanburg, South Carolina and deployed it on an urban freeway network in Baltimore, Maryland to evaluate its transportability. The study found no significant differences in the detection performance between the original network and a new network that the VII-SVM system has not seen before. This demonstrated the feasibility of developing a generic VII-SVM system, applicable across transportation networks.					16th ITS World Congress and Exhibition on Intelligent Transportation Systems and Services16th ITS World Congress and Exhibition on Intelligent Transportation Systems and Services	SEP 21-25, 2009SEP 21-25, 2009		Stockholm, SWEDENStockholm, SWEDEN	4	2	0	0	0	6			1751-956X	1751-9578		WOS:000284307500012		
J	Pundlik, Shrinivas; Woodard, Damon; Birchfield, Stan								Iris segmentation in non-ideal images using graph cuts								IMAGE AND VISION COMPUTING				28	12			1671	1681		10.1016/j.imavis.2010.05.004			DEC 2010	2010	A non-ideal iris image segmentation approach based on graph cuts is presented that uses both the appearance and eye geometry information. A texture measure based on gradients is computed to discriminate between eyelash and non-eyelash regions, combined with image intensity differences between the iris, pupil, and the background (region surrounding the iris) are utilized as cues for segmentation. The texture and intensity distributions for the various regions are learned from histogramming and explicit sampling of the pixels estimated to belong to the corresponding regions. The image is modeled as a Markov Random Field and the energy minimization is achieved via graph cuts to assign each image pixel one of the four possible labels: iris, pupil, background, and eyelash. Furthermore, the iris region is modeled as an ellipse, and the best fitting ellipse to the initial pixel based iris segmentation is computed to further refine the segmented region. As a result, the iris region mask and the parameterized iris shape form the outputs of the proposed approach that allow subsequent iris recognition steps to be performed for the segmented irises. The algorithm is unsupervised and can deal with non-ideality in the iris images due to out-of-plane rotation of the eye, iris occlusion by the eyelids and the eyelashes, multi-modal iris grayscale intensity distribution, and various illumination effects. The proposed segmentation approach is tested on several publicly available non-ideal near infra red (NIR) iris image databases. We compare both the segmentation error and the resulting recognition error with several leading techniques, demonstrating significantly improved results with the proposed technique.

While managers have made significant investments in IT, inflexible legacy systems hinder their ability to respond quickly to market opportunities. Our study examined how the flexibility of an organization's IT infrastructure enhanced information generation and dissemination and that this increased their ability to respond to rapidly changing environments. Our discussion of these information building and information leveraging effects was grounded in the resource-based view of the firm. We empirically tested our model using data collected from senior executives of 105 manufacturing and service firms. We found that IT infrastructure flexibility was positively related to information generation and dissemination. Moreover, information generation was significantly related to organizational responsiveness. Finally, organizational responsiveness was positively related to the firm's competitive advantage. These results showed the importance of developing a flexible IT infrastructure that can be quickly adapted and reconfigured to meet information processing demands in dynamic environments.

How does exposure to competing demands shape the morphology of species and influence the divergence of populations? We explored these questions by performing selection experiments on juveniles of the Hawaiian goby Sicyopterus stimpsoni, an amphidromous fish that exhibits morphological differences across portions of its geographic range where different environmental pressures predominate. Juvenile S. stimpsoni face two primary and potentially opposing selective pressures on body shape as they return from the ocean to freshwater streams on islands: (1) avoiding predators in the lower reaches of a stream; and (2) climbing waterfalls to reach the habitats occupied by adults. These pressures differ in importance across the Hawaiian Islands. On the youngest island, Hawai'i, waterfalls are close to shore, thereby minimizing exposure to predators and placing a premium on climbing performance. In contrast, on the oldest major island, Kaua'i, waterfalls have eroded further inland, lengthening the exposure of juveniles to predators before migrating juveniles begin climbing. Both juvenile and adult fish show differences in body shape between these islands that would be predicted to improve evasion of predators by fish from Kaua'i (e.g., taller bodies that improve thrust) and climbing performance for fish from Hawai'i (e.g., narrower bodies that reduce drag), matching the prevailing environmental demand on each island. To evaluate how competing selection pressures and functional tradeoffs contribute to the divergence in body shape observed in S. stimpsoni, we compared selection imposed on juvenile body shape by (1) predation by the native fish Eleotris sandwicensis versus (2) climbing an artificial waterfall (similar to 100 body lengths). Some variables showed opposing patterns of selection that matched predictions: for example, survivors of predation had lower fineness ratios than did control fish (i.e., greater body depth for a given length), whereas successful climbers had higher fineness ratios (reducing drag) than did fish that failed. However, most morphological variables showed significant selection in only one treatment rather than opposing selection across both. Thus, functional tradeoffs between evasion of predators and minimizing drag during climbing might influence divergence in body shape across subpopulations, but even when selection is an important contributing mechanism, directly opposite patterns of selection across environmental demands are not required to generate morphological divergence.

We review the past literature on status attainment in general and aspirations and expectations, in particular, and draw from it a set of six hypotheses to guide the analysis. Most theoretical statements in this field have been developed on the basis of U.S. data; studies in other immigrant-receiving countries, especially outside the Anglophone world, have been scarce. The study thus provides an opportunity to test and refine existing hypotheses in a different national context. We present breakdowns of educational and occupational aspirations and expectations by gender, parental education and type of school attended. This is followed by multivariate regressions of all four dependent variables on these three plus other predictors suggested by the research literature. This analysis ends with structural equation models - recursive and non-recursive - that provide an integrated theoretical statement of the causal structure of ambition in the Spanish context. Implications of our findings for theory and policy are examined. Suggestions for future research in this field are discussed.									16	0	0	0	1	16			0197-9183			WOS:000284895800001	22904591

Prevalence and correlates of service utilization and help seeking in a national college sample of female rape victims								JOURNAL OF ANXIETY DISORDERS				24	8			900	902		10.1016/j.janxdis.2010.06.014			DEC 2010	2010	This study examines prevalence and correlates of help seeking for emotional problems among undergraduate female rape victims. A national college sample of women endorsing a lifetime history of rape (N=228) were interviewed in 2006 to assess demographic characteristics, rape history, rape characteristics, psychopathology, and substance abuse. Participants were asked if they ever sought help for emotional problems, and what type(s) of services were sought (medical professional, religious figure, or mental health professional). Prevalence of help seeking was 52%. Of help-seekers, 93% went to a mental health professional, 48% went to a medical doctor, and 14% sought religious counsel. Only PTSD was related to ever seeking help (OR = 2.35). Findings suggest that university-based mental health and medical facilities should be well prepared to identify and treat PTSD and other rape-related sequelae. Health promotion campaigns are needed to target substance abusing and depressed rape victims, who were less likely to seek help. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

After acclimation at room temperature, the inoculated compost was initially adjusted to moisture levels of 10-50% and then kept in a greenhouse under different seasons. The populations of all three pathogens increased by 2.1-3.9 log CFU g(-1) within 3 days in autoclaved compost with initial moisture content of at least 40%. Listeria monocytogenes multiplied up to 2 4 log CFU g(-1) in compost with initial moisture content of 30% and was detected up to 28 days for all seasons, whereas populations of both E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella increased by c. 1 log in compost with initial moisture content of 30% during winter months only. No pathogen growth in nonautoclaved compost was detected.Conclusion: Bacterial species, temperature, light intensity and moisture content affected the growth potential and survival of pathogens in compost when the population of background microflora was low.Significance and Impact of the Study: Keeping compost as dry as possible and maintaining certain levels of background microflora may be critical to prevent the growth of pathogens.									14	0	0	9	0	14			1364-5072			WOS:000284170300026	20846332

Osteoclast (OCL) is the multinucleated bone-resorbing cell. In this study, we used the NASA developed ground-based rotating wall vessel bioreactor (RWV), rotary cell culture system (RCCS) to simulate mu Xg conditions and demonstrated a significant increase (2-fold) in osteoclastogenesis compared to normal gravity control (Xg). Gene expression profiling of RAW 264.7 OCL progenitor cells in modelled mu Xg by Agilent microarray analysis revealed significantly increased expression of critical molecules such as cytokines/growth factors, proteases and signalling proteins, which play an important role in enhanced OCL differentiation/function. Transcription factors such as c-Jun. MITE and CREB implicated in OCL differentiation are upregulated; however no significant change in the levels of NFATcl expression in preosteoclast cells subjected to modelled mu Xg. We also identified high-level expression of calcium-binding protein, S100A8 (calcium-binding protein molecule A8/calgranulin A) in preosteoclast cells under mu Xg. Furthermore, modelled mu Xg stimulated RAW 264.7 cells showed elevated cytosolic calcium (Ca(2+)) levels/oscillations compared to Xg cells. siRNA knock-down of S100A8 expression in RAW 264.7 cells resulted in a significant decrease in modelled mu Xg stimulated OCL differentiation. We also identified elevated levels of phospho-CREB in preosteoclast cells subjected to modelled mu Xg compared to Xg. Thus, modelled mu Xg regulated gene expression profiling in preosteoclast cells provide new insights into molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets of enhanced OCL differentiation/activation to prevent bone loss and fracture risk in astronauts during space flight missions.

[Zn(dmit)(4)][BF(4)](2) crystallizes in space group Pbcn with a = 11.954(2) angstrom, b = 21.260(4) angstrom, c = 12.749(3) angstrom, Z = 4.

Both structures display a compressed tetrahedral geometry in the zinc coordination sphere similar to previously reported isopropyl and n-butyl analogs. The degree of distortion is closer to that noted for the recently reported methyl isopropyl analog than to the methyl n-butyl complex. There are no significant differences between the nitrate and tetrafluoroborate coordination spheres, and the source of distortion appears to be close intramolecular contacts. Thermogravimetric analysis results suggest that both complexes decompose to yield ZnS(2) instead of ZnS.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1074-1542			WOS:000284365300006

Children in foster care experience even higher levels of mental health problems. Unfortunately, only 7% to 16% of those children actually receive mental health services-typically provided by schools. Consequently, school-based mental health services have moved in new directions in recent years, including increased training for teachers, infusion of more mental health practitioners, and renewed commitment to the wraparound approach. However, all of these require time and money. An often neglected area is the availability of federal funding intended to provide children and adolescents with access to mental health services in schools. The purpose of this article is to describe federal legislative mandates and initiatives that have funding mechanisms to provide mental health services to children in schools. The challenges schools face in implementing these services are also addressed.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1044-2073			WOS:000208562900005

Remediation of Nitrogen and Phosphorus from Nursery Runoff during the Spring via Free Water Surface Constructed Wetlands								Journal of Environmental Horticulture				28	4			209	217					DEC 2010	2010	Agricultural operations face increasing pressure to remediate runoff to reduce deterioration of surface water quality. Some nursery operations use free water surface constructed wetland systems (CWSs) to remediate nutrient-rich runoff. Our objectives were twofold, first to examine the impact of two hydraulic retention times (HRT, 3.5 and 5.5 day) on CWS performance, and second to determine if increased nutrient loading from internal CWS and nursery sources during the spring contributed to nutrient export in excess of regulatory limits. We quantified nutrient loading and removal efficiency in a free water surface CWS from late winter through late spring over three years and monitored various water quality parameters. Total nitrogen in runoff was reduced from 20.6 +/- 2.8 mg.liter(-1) (ppm) to 4.1 +/- 1.3 mg.liter(-1) (ppm) nitrogen after CWS treatment. Phosphorus dynamics in the CWS were more variable and unlike nitrogen dynamics were not consistently influenced by water temperature and hydraulic loading rate. Phosphorus concentrations were reduced from 1.7 +/- 0.8 mg.liter(-1) (ppm) PO4-P in influent to 1.2 +/- 0.6 mg.liter(-1) (ppm) PO4-P in CWS effluent, but substantial variability existed among years in both phosphorus loading and removal rates. The CWS was able to efficiently remediate nitrogen even under high spring loading rates.									6	0	0	5	0	6			0738-2898			BCI:BCI201100062668

Drug- or Alcohol-Facilitated, Incapacitated, and Forcible Rape in Relationship to Mental Health Among a National Sample of Women								JOURNAL OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE				25	12			2217	2236		10.1177/0886260509354887			DEC 2010	2010	Rape is a well-established risk factor for mental health disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. However, most studies have focused on forcible rape tactics and have not distinguished these from tactics that involve drug or alcohol intoxication. The authors' aim was to examine correlates of PTSD and depression in a community sample of women, with particular emphasis on evaluating the unique effects of lifetime exposure to three specific rape tactics. A nationally representative sample of 3,001 noninstitutionalized, civilian, English-or Spanish-speaking women (aged 18-86 years) participated in a structured telephone interview by use of Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) technology. Multivariable models showed that history of drug or alcohol-facilitated rape tactics (OR = 1.87, p<.05) and history of forcible rape tactics (OR = 3.46, p<.001) were associated with PTSD. History of forcible rape was associated with depression (OR = 3.65, p<.001). Forcible rape tactics were associated with a number of factors that may have contributed to their stronger association with mental health outcomes, including force, injury, lower income, revictimization history, and labeling the event as rape. The results underscore the importance of using a behaviorally specific assessment of rape history, as rape tactic and multiple rape history differentially predicted psychopathology outcomes. The association between drug-or alcohol-facilitated rape tactics and PTSD suggests that these are important rape tactics to include in assessments and future studies.									14	0	0	4	0	14			0886-2605			WOS:000283652900004	20100896

These direct flow (also referred to as dead end or normal flow) filtration membranes are designed to reject virus particles and yield >98% product recovery for proteins less than 170 kDa. Virus filtration feed streams generally have high purity and high product concentrations. Decrease in permeate flux during virus filtration, which reduces filter capacity, is most likely due to fouling by small aggregates of the product species present in the feed stream.Retrovirus and parvovirus filtration membranes, as well as two ultrafiltration membranes with NMW-COs of 300 and 10 kDa (kg mol(-1)), were tested using feed streams consisting of minute virus of mice (MVM) in the presence and absence of 1% (w/v) BSA. A novelty of our work comes from the fact that we directly compare the performance of these membranes using realistic model feed streams consisting of MVM (an FDA recommended model virus) and BSA. This approach provides an industrially relevant benchmark of the engineering performance of virus filters with respect to a limited set of structural and operational variants. All asymmetric membranes were operated in direct flow, constant pressure mode with the filtration surface (i.e. skin surface) facing away from the feed stream as is industrial practice for virus filtration. In addition, the 10 kDa ultrafiltration membrane was also operated with the skin surface facing the feed stream as is industrial practice for ultrafiltration. While little rejection of virus particles was observed for the 10 kDa membrane when the skin surface faced away from the feed stream, significant (in excess of 3 log) virus rejection was observed when the skin surface faced the feed stream.Changes in permeate flux with filtrate volume were determined along with parvovirus rejection. Decreases in permeate flux were shown to result from fouling in the presence of BSA. No decrease in permeate flux was observed in the absence of BSA. The decrease in permeate flux has been analyzed in terms of classical pore blockage models. The results of this work, which compare the performance of virus filtration and similar ultrafiltration membranes, provide insights into designing virus filtration membranes. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, uniform pore size, high porosity microfiltration membranes were developed using three-dimensionally ordered macroporous templates. A membrane casting cell was designed for self-assembly of silica spheres into a colloidal crystal template. The resulting close-packed colloidal crystal was infiltrated with a reactive monomer solution. After polymerization, the silica spheres were etched away, resulting in an inverse colloidal crystal (ICC) membrane with high porosity and uniform pores that are highly interconnected.ICC membranes have been fabricated with a range of pore sizes and thicknesses. The membrane casting cell facilitates easy variation of membrane thickness. The membrane pore size is varied by changing the diameter of the silica spheres used to prepare the colloidal crystal template. By changing the composition of the reactive monomer solution, membranes have been fabricated with different hydrophilicities. Following synthesis, the ICC membranes were tested in a commercially available stirred cell. Particle fractionation was studied in normal flow filtration experiments. For bi-disperse particle suspensions, significant passage of particles smaller than the membrane pore size was observed if the ratio of large to small particles was around 14. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

J	Silvers, Stuart								Methodological and Moral Muddles in Evolutionary Psychology								JOURNAL OF MIND AND BEHAVIOR				31	1-2			65	83					WIN-SPR 2010	2010	Evolutionary psychology, the self-proclaimed scientific theory of human nature, owes much of its controversial notoriety to reports in public media. In part this is because of its bold claims that human psychological characteristics are adaptations to the Pleistocene environment in which they evolved and these inherited characteristics we exhibit now constitute our human nature. Proponents maintain that evolutionary psychology is a scientific account of human nature that explains what this much abused concept means. Critics counter that some evolutionary psychological hypotheses threaten to undermine other intuitive concepts of human nature and well-being, specifically, by emphasizing purported scientific evidence of natural inequalities based on sex, gender, or race. They argue that this "gene machine" view entails consequences endorsing or at least seeming to give scientific aid and comfort to politically conservative, "right-wing" social agendas. Proponents deny that the theory has such unwelcome implications. Such objections, they reply, stem from "left-wing" egalitarian ideologies that presuppose the cogency of the disputed tabula rasa concept of mind intrinsic to the standard social science model of behavior explanations. Philip Kitcher's (1985) initial scathing analysis of sociobiology, now called evolutionary psychology, as the science of human nature went basically unchallenged. Bioethicist Janet Radcliffe Richards (2000) has given a detailed critique of Kitcher's arguments; she finds them to be "leftward-leaning," and wanting. Here I examine her arguments and find them wanting though not "rightward-leaning."									0	0	0	0	0	0			0271-0137			WOS:000280876600005		
J	Schoenfuss, Heiko L.; Roos, John D.; Rivera, Angela R. V.; Blob, Richard W.								Motor Patterns of Distal Hind Limb Muscles in Walking Turtles: Implications for Models of Limb Bone Loading								JOURNAL OF MORPHOLOGY				271	12			1527	1536		10.1002/jmor.10901			DEC 2010	2010	Previous studies of limb bone loading in walking turtles indicate that the ground reaction force exerts a flexor moment at the ankle during stance, requiring extensor muscle activity to maintain joint equilibrium. Of four proposed ankle extensors in turtles, two (gastrocnemius medialis, pronator profundus) originate on the tibia and fibula, respectively, while the other two (flexor digitorum longus, gastrocnemius lateralis) originate from the distal femur, crossing the flexor aspect of the knee and potentially eliciting compensatory forces from antagonist knee extensor muscles that could contribute to femoral stress. Published bone stress models assume all four proposed ankle extensors are active during stance in turtles. However, if only the ankle extensors that cross the knee were active then femoral stresses might be higher than predicted by published models, whereas if only extensors that do not cross the knee were active then femoral stresses might be lower than predicted. We analyzed synchronized footfall and electromyographic activity patterns in slider turtles (Trachemys scripta) and found that all four proposed ankle extensors were active during at least part of stance phase in most individuals, corroborating bone stress models. However, activation patterns were complex, with multiple bursts in many ankle extensors that frequently persisted into swing phase. In addition, two hypothesized ankle flexors (tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum communis) were frequently active during stance. This might increase the joint moment that ankle extensors must counter, elevating the forces they transfer across the knee joint and, thereby, raising femoral stress. Recognition of these activity patterns may help reconcile differences between evaluations of loads on turtle limbs based on force platform versus in vivo strain studies. Moreover, while some variation in motor patterns for the distal hind limbs of turtles may reflect functional compartmentalization of muscles, it may also indicate flexibility in the control of their limb movements.

Thermal properties, activation energy for crystallization, Johnson-Mehl-Avrami exponent, nucleation and growth regimes and rates were determined and shown to depend on glass composition. These variations were related to the domain of glass formation in the TeO2-Bi2O3-ZnO ternary glass system: the glasses with x = 15 and 25 are at the limit of the glass formation domain while the glasses with x =17.5 and 20 are in the middle of the glass-forming region. From the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami parameter, which increases slightly from 1.7 to 2.2 when x increases from 15 to 25, and from optical micrographs, the predominant crystallization in the investigated glasses is expected to be 2 dimensional bulk crystallization governed by diffusion. Using XRD, we found that Bi2O3 crystals are the first crystals to form in the glasses when heat treated at their respective temperatures of maximum nucleation. When heat treated at a higher temperature the Bi2O3 crystals were found to transform into Bi2Te4O11. We observed an increase in the crystal size when the glasses were heat treated at their respective temperatures of maximum nucleation revealing a probable overlap between the nucleation and growth regimes in all the glasses, the largest overlap being for the glass with x = 15. Thus, this glass is not an appropriate material candidate for applications which require controlled nucleation and growth as a large distribution of crystal sizes can be obtained in the glass when heat treated at its temperature of maximum nucleation rate. The glass with x = 25 is suspected to be also an inappropriate candidate for this kind of applications as it has a higher tendency to fully crystallize in a small temperature range than the other glasses as evidenced by its high N-q and I-n.

The structure of the glass' network has been characterized using Raman spectroscopy and has been related to the viscosity temperature behavior and the fragility parameter (m) of the glasses. As the concentration of ZnO in the TBZ system (x) increases, the fragility parameter of the glass increases, whereas it decreases with an increase of the ZnO concentration (y) in the TNZ system. In both glasses, these variations in m have been related to the partial depolymerization of the tellurite network associated with the level of modifier content. The depolymerization of the tellurite network is believed to be the result of a reduction in the number of [TeO4] units and the formation of [TeO3] and [TeO3+1] units that occurs with a change in TeO2 content in the TBZ system and modifier content in the TNZ system.

This work takes advantage of a hypersensitive Escherichia coli genetic system to identify genes involved in resistance to nitrosative stress imposed by reactive nitrogen intermediates. Among the ten candidate genes identified, the transposase, UvrB and DNA topoisomerase IV are involved in DNA transaction; the sigma-32 factor and the putative DNA-binding protein may be involved in transcriptional regulation; IF-2 is involved in protein translation; malate dehydrogenase and carbamoyl-phosphate synthase are metabolic enzymes; and the ABC transporter is a membrane-bound protein. In addition, a hypothetical protein was identified. The role of the DNA repair gene uvrB in resistance to RNI was further confirmed by investigating the sensitivity of uvrB deletion mutant and complementation by C. burnetii uvrB. Deletion of two other components of the UvrABC nuclease, uvrA and uvrC also renders the cell sensitive to RNI. The relationship between UvrABC and nitrosative stress is discussed.

Such fibers, generally focused to-date on silicon and germanium cores, define a new class of optical fibers that have the potential to significantly advance the fields of nonlinear fiber optics and infrared power delivery. They also can provide considerable insight into the fundamentals of crystal growth and the interplay between thermodynamics and kinetics under non-equilibrium conditions. More specifically, this review begins with a brief history of the international efforts to-date and is followed by a more in-depth discussion of the processing and properties of crystalline unary (silicon and germanium) and binary (indium antimonide) semiconductor optical fibers prepared by a molten core approach that enables long lengths at relatively high speeds by comparison to other fabrication methods. Further, the fundamental performance limits are postulated as are a range of present and future applications. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

J	Dong, Liang; Thomas, Brian K.; Suzuki, Shigeru; Fu, Libin								Extending transmission bandwidth of air-core photonic bandgap fibers								OPTICAL FIBER TECHNOLOGY				16	6			442	448		10.1016/j.yofte.2010.08.003			DEC 2010	2010	Air-core photonic bandgap fibers offer many unique properties and are critical to many emerging applications. A notable property is the high nonlinear threshold which provides a foundation for applications at high peak powers. The strong interaction of light and air is also essential for a number of emerging applications, especially those based on nonlinear interactions and spectroscopy. For many of those applications, much wider transmission bandwidths are desired to accommodate a wider tuning range or the large number of optical wavelengths involved. Presently, air-core photonic bandgap fibers have a cladding of hexagonal lattice. The densely packed geometry of hexagonal stacking does not allow large nodes in the cladding, which would provide a further increase of photonic bandgaps. On the other hand, a photonic cladding with a square lattice can potentially provide much larger nodes and consequently wider bandgap. In this work, the potentials of much wider bandgap with square lattice cladding is theoretically studied and experimentally demonstrated. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of the present investigation was to optimize deposition conditions for preparation of pure and Tm3+ doped sulfide films by radio-frequency magnetron sputtering. The study of their composition, morphological characteristics and thermal properties was realized by scanning electronic microscope attached with energy dispersive spectroscopy, Rutherford backscattering, X-ray diffraction, and micro-thermal probe. Some optical properties, like transmission, index of refraction, optical band-gap, propagation modes from 633 to 1540 nm, were investigated on thin films. The whole results point out hopeful perspectives strengthened by the clear observation of the near-infrared photo-luminescence of Tm3+ doped sulfide films. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

J	Luo, Chao-Xi; Hu, Meng-Jun; Jin, Xin; Yin, Liang-Fen; Bryson, Patricia K.; Schnabel, Guido								An intron in the cytochrome b gene of Monilinia fructicola mitigates the risk of resistance development to QoI fungicides								PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE				66	12			1308	1315		10.1002/ps.2016			DEC 2010	2010	BACKGROUND: The cytochrome b (Cyt b) gene is a key genetic determinant for quinone outside inhibitor (QoI) fungicide resistance in plant pathogenic fungi. A mutation at amino acid position G143 can cause qualitative resistance unless it is part of the recognition site for a self-splicing intron. The objective of this study was to clone and sequence the Cyt b gene from Monilinia fructicola (Wint.) Honey, the causal agent of brown rot of stone fruits, and to assess the risk for the development of a mutation at position 143.RESULTS: The Cyt b gene of M. fructicola was 11 927 bp in size and contained seven introns located at cDNA positions (5'-3') 204, 395, 430, 491, 507, 780 and 812 with sizes of 1592, 1318, 1166, 1252, 1065, 2131 and 2227 bp respectively. Sequence analysis revealed that the above-mentioned 1166 bp intron, a self-splicing group I intron, was located just downstream of the G143 codon. The Cyt b gene region covering the G143 location and the adjacent 1166 bp intron was PCR amplified and sequenced from Chinese and US isolates, indicating that the intron may be omnipresent in M. fructicola.CONCLUSION: This is the first complete Cyt b gene sequence published for M. fructicola or any other Monilinia species, forming the basis for molecular analysis of QoI fungicide resistance. Sequence analysis revealed that the G143A mutation responsible for high levels of QoI fungicide resistance in many plant pathogenic fungi may not develop in M. fructicola unless genotypes emerge that lack the 1166 bp intron.

Plant signaling & behavior				5	12			1657	9					2010-Dec	2010	A novel autoregulation of nodulation locus in Medicago truncatula, lss, silences the SUNN gene thorough a cis-acting mechanism. Microarray analysis was performed on the Affymetrix Gene Chip Medicago Genome Array with cDNA isolated from seven-day-old seedlings of wild type, sunn-1 and lss plants. The results suggest that in lss plants expression of only a few dozen genes differs significantly from wild type while in sunn-1 plants expression of several hundred genes represented by over 800 probe sets is altered. These results suggest that the kinase domain modification caused by the sunn-1 mutation alters the receptor's influence on gene expression and that these differences are present even in the absence of nodulation.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1559-2324		MEDLINE:21150299	21150299

Insect resistance to the pore-forming Cry1Ac toxin is correlated with the loss of high-affinity, irreversible binding to the mid-gut membrane, but the genetic factors responsible for this change have been elusive. Mutations in a 12-cadherin-domain protein confer some Cry1Ac resistance but do not block this toxin binding in in vitro assays. We sought to identify mutations in other genes that might be responsible for the loss of binding. We employed a map-based cloning approach using a series of backcrosses with 1,060 progeny to identify a resistance gene in the cotton pest Heliothis virescens that segregated independently from the cadherin mutation. We found an inactivating mutation of the ABC transporter ABCC2 that is genetically linked to Cry1Ac resistance and is correlated with loss of Cry1Ac binding to membrane vesicles. ABC proteins are integral membrane proteins with many functions, including export of toxic molecules from the cell, but have not been implicated in the mode of action of Bt toxins before. The reduction in toxin binding due to the inactivating mutation suggests that ABCC2 is involved in membrane integration of the toxin pore. Our findings suggest that ABC proteins may play a key role in the mode of action of Bt toxins and that ABC protein mutations can confer high levels of resistance that could threaten the continued utilization of Bt-expressing crops. However, such mutations may impose a physiological cost on resistant insects, by reducing export of other toxins such as plant secondary compounds from the cell. This weakness could be exploited to manage this mechanism of Bt resistance in the field.									115	7	0	104	1	122			1553-7404			WOS:000285578900026	21187898

Progress in pediatric cardiology				30	1-2			71	80		10.1016/j.ppedcard.2010.09.009			2010-Dec-1	2010	Despite the recent advances in computational modeling, experimental simulation of the circulation with congenital heart defect using mock flow circuits remains an important tool for device testing, and for detailing the probable flow consequences resulting from surgical and interventional corrections. Validated mock circuits can be applied to qualify the results from novel computational models. New mathematical tools, coupled with advanced clinical imaging methods, allow for improved assessment of experimental circuit performance relative to human function, as well as the potential for patient-specific adaptation. In this review, we address the development of three in vitro mock circuits specific for studies of congenital heart defects. Performance of an in vitro right heart circulation circuit through a series of verification and validation exercises is described, including correlations with animal studies, and quantifying the effects of circuit inertiance on test results. We present our experience in the design of mock circuits suitable for investigations of the characteristics of the Fontan circulation. We use one such mock circuit to evaluate the accuracy of Doppler predictions in the presence of aortic coarctation.									4	0	0	3	0	4			1058-9813			MEDLINE:21218147	21218147

The IIM for supply chain networks has been proposed, based on the original IIM used in macro-economics. A new method called the OWA (Ordered Weighted Averaging) Operator has been formulated to evaluate the interdependency matrix, a key component of the IIM. Similar to the capability of the basic IIM to describe the propagation impacts of disruptions to macroeconomic systems, the IIM for supply chain networks is capable of describing the propagation effects of disruptions to interdependent supply chain components. IIM assesses the impacts of disruptions to supply chain networks with "inoperability" and "economic losses" metrics, which can provide helpful insights for risk management of supply chain networks. An example supply chain network is used to illustrate the application of IIM for systemic risk assessment of supply chains under an unsafe environment. A risk mitigation strategy by increasing the number of suppliers has been considered to reduce the adverse effects caused by the supply reduction of the single secondary supplier in the example supply chain network. In addition, a simulation model integrated with Monte Carlo simulation method has been developed to validate the accuracy of the IIM for supply chain. The example shows that the application of IIM can provide useful guidance toward supply chain risk management or mitigation strategies and it could also be used to test the effectiveness of these strategies.

This counterintuitive prediction is experimentally confirmed for a single-phase, Mo +0.5 at. % Ni alloy. This study calls for a reappraisal of the classical GB adsorption (segregation) theories to consider the coupling with structural disordering, and it critically supports GB premelting and prewetting theories with broad applications.									16	1	0	0	0	17			0031-9007	1079-7114		WOS:000286732400014	21231482

The decrease in degree of dissociation of the protogenic groups follows the order phosphonic > phosphinic > sulfonic, and the degree of dissociation and the magnitude of ion-ion correlations are approximately independent of chain length.									9	1	0	0	0	9			1520-6106			WOS:000284287700022	21028860

Glucosinolates were evaluated from roots, leaves, flowers, primary, and secondary branches. Seventeen glucosinolates were identified, with glucoerucin, glucoraphenin, glucobrassicin, and gluconasturtiin contributing 90% to 100% of the total glucosinolates. Flowers contained the highest glucosinolate concentrations, 12.07 to 55.36 mu rnol/g, but flowers contributed only 5.3 to 21.3% to the total glucosinolates. Of the eight accessions, the Mississippi accession produced significantly higher levels of total glucosinolates and glucosinolates which can be degraded to isothiocyanates per plant, totals of 618.97 and 563.53 mu mol/plant, respectively. Total plant biomass did not differ between accessions indicating a difference in the ability of the Mississippi accession to produce glucosinolates. Further studies are needed to determine if this accession would consistently produce higher glucosinolate levels under different environmental conditions.									8	2	0	9	0	10			0021-8561			WOS:000284203000015	20964435	
J	Dietrich, Craig J.; Morad, Martin								Synaptic Acidification Enhances GABA(A) Signaling								JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE				30	47			16044	16052		10.1523/JNEUROSCI.6364-09.2010			NOV 24 2010	2010	To determine the role of cellularly generated protons in synaptic signaling, we recorded GABA miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) from cultured rat cerebellar granule cells (CGCs) while varying the extracellular pH buffering capacity. Consistent with previous reports, we found that increasing pH from 7.4 to 8.0 sped mIPSC rise time and suppressed both amplitude of the current and total charge transferred. Conversely, acidification (from pH 7.4 to 6.8) slowed the rise time and increased current amplitude and total charge transferred. In a manner consistent with alkalinization, increasing the buffering capacity from 3 to 24 mM HEPES at pH 7.4 resulted in faster mIPSC rise time, a 37% reduction in amplitude, and a 48% reduction in charge transferred. Supplementing the normal physiological buffers (24 mM HCO3-/5%CO2) with 10 mM HEPES similarly diminished mIPSCs in a manner consistent with alkalinization, resulting in faster rise time, a 39% reduction in amplitude, and a 51% reduction in charge transferred. These findings suggest the existence of an acidifying synaptic force that is overcome by commonly used concentrations (10 mM) of HEPES buffer. Here we show that Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) activity appears to, in part, contribute to this synaptic acidification because inhibition of NHE by amiloride or lithium under physiological or weak buffering conditions alters mIPSCs in a manner consistent with alkalinization. These results suggest that acidification of the synaptic cleft occurs physiologically during GABAergic transmission and that NHE plays a critical role in generating the acidic nano-environment at the synapse.									31	2	0	33	0	33			0270-6474			WOS:000284580100034	21106843

This is because the quantum gate set that can be generated by braiding of the Majorana fermions does not include any two-qubit gate and also no single-qubit pi/8 phase gate. In principle, it is possible to create these crucial extra gates using quantum interference of Majorana fermion currents. However, it is not clear if the motion of the various order parameter defects (vortices, domain walls, etc.), to which the Majorana fermions are bound in a TS medium, can be quantum coherent. We show that these obstacles can be overcome using a semiconductor quantum wire network in the vicinity of an s-wave superconductor, by constructing topologically protected two-qubit gates and any arbitrary single-qubit phase gate in a topologically unprotected manner, which can be error corrected using magic-state distillation. Thus our strategy, using a judicious combination of topologically protected and unprotected gate operations, realizes UQC on a quantum wire network with a remarkably high error threshold of 0.14as compared to 10(-3) to 10(-4) in ordinary unprotected quantum computation.									77	0	0	1	0	77			1050-2947			WOS:000284395600002

Rashba-enhanced plasmon in a two-dimensional lateral superlattice								PHYSICAL REVIEW B				82	20					205322	10.1103/PhysRevB.82.205322			NOV 18 2010	2010	The self-consistent density response of an electron system is studied in a two-dimensional (2D) lateral superlattice (SL) with spin-orbit interaction (SOI). Under the effect of the lateral periodic potential, the single-electron 2D states are broadened into minibands that are spin split by SOI. In the case of a single fully occupied miniband, we calculate the long-wavelength limit of the polarization function for intraband transitions, within the random-phase approximation at T = 0 K, and identify the plasmonic dispersion relation in the effective-mass approximation. The interplay between band effects and SOI coupling, considered here to be linear in the electron momentum (Rashba), is shown to generate a highly anisotropic collective excitation spectrum. If the plasmon propagating perpendicular on the superlattice axis has the characteristic frequency of the quasi-one-dimensional system weakly modified by the SOI split, the one propagating along the SL axis is enhanced by the SOI that couples, through its dependence on the periodic momentum of a Bloch electron, density fluctuations in different layers of the superlattice. The excitation frequency of this mode is found to depend on the miniband width and the amplitude of the SOI coupling constant.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1098-0121			WOS:000284400700001

Aminoglycoside Binding to Oxytricha nova Telomeric DNA								BIOCHEMISTRY				49	45			9891	9903		10.1021/bi101517e			NOV 16 2010	2010	Telomeric DNA sequences have been at the center stage of drug design for cancer treatment in recent years. The ability of these DNA structures to form four-stranded nucleic acid structures, called G-quadruplexes, has been perceived as target for inhibiting telomerase activity vital for the longevity of cancer cells. Being highly diverse in structural forms, these G-quadruplexes are subjects of detailed studies of ligand-DNA interactions of different classes, which will pave the way for logical design of more potent ligands in future. The binding of aminoglycosides was investigated with Oxytricha nova quadruplex forming DNA sequence (GGGGTTTTGGGG)(2). Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) determined ligand to quadruplex binding ratio shows 1:1 neomycin:quadruplex binding with association constants (K) similar to 10(5) M(-1) while paromomycin was found to have a 2-fold weaker affinity than neomycin. The CD titration experiments with neomycin resulted in minimal changes in the CD signal. FID assays, performed to determine the minimum concentration required to displace half of the fluorescent probe bound, showed neomycin as the best of the all aminoglycosides studied for quadruplex binding. Initial NMR footprint suggests that ligand-DNA interactions occur in the wide groove of the quadruplex. Computational docking studies also indicate that amino-glycosides bind in the wide groove of the quadruplex.									36	1	0	27	0	36			0006-2960			WOS:000283833800026	20886815

Under some controlled fabrication conditions, axially aligned grooves can be formed on the HFM inner surface during typical immersion precipitation-based phase inversion fabrication processes. Such grooved HFMs are found to be promising for nerve repair and regeneration. The axially aligned grooves appearing on the inner surface of the membrane are considered as hydrodynamic instability patterns. During the immersion precipitation process, a transfer of solvent takes place across the interface between a polymer solution and a nonsolvent. This solvent transfer induces gradients of interfacial tension that are considered to be the driving mechanism for Marangoni instability. The onset of the stationary instability is studied by means of a linear instability theory, and the critical and maximum wavenumbers are determined and discussed in terms of the dimensionless groups characterizing the system: viscosity ratio, diffusivity ratio. Schmidt number, crispation number, adsorption number. Marangoni number, and the polymer bulk concentration. A good agreement is found between the predicted wavelength of the most dangerous wave and the experimental groove width. Consequently, solutal Marangoni instability can explain the groove formation mechanism in HFM fabrication.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0743-7463			WOS:000283837800052	20923184

We derive the conditions under which the system is in a non-Abelian phase. By considering the nondegenerate zero-energy Majorana solutions of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equations for a vortex and by constructing a topological invariant, we show that the condition for the non-Abelian phase to exist is completely independent of the triplet pairing amplitude. The existence condition for the non-Abelian phase derived from the real-space solutions of the BdG equations involves the Pfaffian of the BdG Hamiltonian at k=0, which is completely insensitive to the magnitude of the p-wave component of the order parameter. We arrive at the same conclusion by using the appropriate topological invariant for this case. This is in striking contrast to the analogous condition for the time-reversal invariant topological phases, in which the amplitude of the p-wave component must be larger than the amplitude of the s-wave piece of the order parameter. As a by-product, we establish the intrinsic connection between the Pfaffian of the BdG Hamiltonian at k=0 (which arises at the BdG approach) and the relevant Z topological invariant.									48	1	0	1	0	48			1098-0121			WOS:000284257500006

This was accomplished using a protocol developed in our laboratory in which the trifluoromethanesulfonate of a phenol undergoes palladium mediated coupling with pinacolborane. Reaction of this dioxaborolane with aqueous-methanolic copper(II) bromide provides the aryl bromide. The affinities of these bromo cannabinoids for the cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors were determined. All of these compounds showed selectivity for the CB2 receptor and one of them, 1-bromo-1-deoxy-3-(1',1'-dimethylhexyl)-Delta(8)-tetrahydrocannabinol (10), exhibits 52-fold selectivity for this receptor with good (28 nM) affinity.

J	Arai, Yuji								X-ray Absorption Spectroscopic Investigation of Molybdenum Multinuclear Sorption Mechanism at the Goethite-Water Interface								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY				44	22			8491	8496		10.1021/es101270g			NOV 15 2010	2010	Understanding in situ metalloid surface speciation on mineral surfaces is critical to predicting the bioavailability in surface and subsurface environments. In this study, Mo K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was used to elucidate Mo(VI) surface speciation at the goethite-water interface. Effects of pH and loading levels were investigated. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) analysis indicated that the Mo(VI) coordination environment changes from tetrahedral to octahedral with decreasing pH. At near neutral pH, Mo(VI) predominantly remains as tetrahedral molecules, forming inner-sphere surface species via corner- and edge-sharing attachment with iron octahedral structures (interatomic distance of Mo-Fe (R(Mo)-F(e)) at similar to 2.8 and similar to 3.4 angstrom, respectively). In contrast, a mixture of surface species comprising tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated Mo(VI) exists at pH similar to 3-4. While the same Mo(VI) tetrahedral surface species are present at acidic pH, there was an additional MoO(6) polymer attachment on iron octahedral structures, resulting in a R(Mo-Fe) at 3.53 angstrom. The coordination number (CN) of a Mo-Mo backscatterer gradually increased with increasing loading level, suggesting the formation of surface polymerization. Overall, there seems to be a transition from Mo(VI) tetrahedral to octahedral coordination environment with decreasing pH. The XAS findings further support a Mo(VI) inner-sphere adsorption mechanism that was previously suggested in the pressure-jump relaxation study by Zhang and Sparks (Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J. 1989, 53(4), 1028-1034). pH-Dependent multinuclear Mo(VI) surface speciation may be important in predicting Mo(VI) transport process in the soil-water environment.									16	0	0	4	0	16			0013-936X			WOS:000284248300023	20964355

Iron oxide coating of particles significantly increased dissolved organic carbon (DOC) uptakes and decreased DBP formation after chlorination compared to uncoated particles. pH values close to neutral levels during adsorption and chlorination provided DOC, trihalomethane and haloacetic acid reductions around 60-75% employing 6 g/L coated particle dosage. Higher degree of DOC and DBP reductions (>85%) were obtained with increasing particle dose. The uptake of bromide by iron oxide surfaces was negligible and increasing bromide concentrations (up to 550 mu g/L) did not negatively impact the DOC uptake. However, due to competition between natural organic matter (NOM) and bicarbonate for the iron oxide surfaces, increasing bicarbonate alkalinity levels reduced DOC uptakes. Overall, the results indicated that the iron oxide-coated pumice/slag particles are effective adsorbents to remove NOM and control DBP formation in waters with relatively high DOC and SUVA(254) levels. However, they may not be effective for waters with alkalinity levels above 250 mg CaCO(3)/L. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									19	2	0	8	0	21			0304-3894			WOS:000282607600049

Computational investigation of impact energy absorption capability of polyurea coatings via deformation-induced glass transition								MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING A-STRUCTURAL MATERIALS PROPERTIES MICROSTRUCTURE AND PROCESSING				527	29-30			7741	7751		10.1016/j.msea.2010.08.042			NOV 15 2010	2010	A number of experimental investigations reported in the open literature have indicated that the application of polyurea coatings can substantially improve blast and ballistic impact resistance/survivability of buildings, vehicles and laboratory test plates. While several potential mechanisms (e.g., shock-impedance mismatch, shock-wave dispersion, fracture-mode conversion and strain delocalization) have been proposed for the observed enhancement in the blast-wave/projectile-energy absorption, direct experimental or analytical evidence for the operation of these mechanisms has been lacking. Recently, it has been proposed that transition of polyurea between its rubbery-state and its glassy-state under high deformation-rate loading conditions is another possible mechanism for the improved ballistic impact resistance of polyurea-coated structures/test plates. In the present work, an attempt is made to provide computational support for this deformation-induced glass transition based energy-dissipation/absorption mechanism. Towards that end, a series of finite-element analyses of the projectile/coated-plate interactions are carried out using a transient non-linear dynamics finite-element approach. The results obtained are used to assess the extent of energy absorption and to identify the mode of failure of the test plate as a function of the imposed impact conditions. The results obtained show that the mechanical response of polyurea under impact conditions is a fairly sensitive function of the difference between the test temperature and the glass transition temperature. Specifically, when this difference is large, polyurea tends to display high-ductility behavior of a stereotypical elastomer in its rubbery-state. On the other hand, when the test temperature is closer to the glass transition temperature, polyurea tends to transform into its glassy-state during deformation and this process is associated with viscous type energy-dissipation. It is also argued that additional energy absorbing/dissipating mechanisms may contribute to the superior ballistic/blast protection capability of polyurea. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Understanding the merger process is greatly aided by examples in the vicinity of the Milky Way due to the availability of high quality positional and kinematic data. The Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy at a distance of 25 kpc is a prime example. Detailed observations of stars in this dwarf galaxy and its associated tidal streams also provide a unique probe of the gravitational field of the Milky Way. To fully utilize this probe requires not only excellent observations but also accurate models of the merging event. We investigate the recent history of the Sagittarius Dwarf with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics/N-body GADGET-2 code, treating both the Milky Way and the dwarf galaxy as a particle system. In addition to considerations of particle number, gravitational softening, stability criteria such as Toomre Q parameter, and angular momentum transport, we add the distinction between static and dynamic potential differences as another aspect that deserves consideration. We find that the commonly employed approximation of a static Milky Way potential induces changes in the orbit corresponding to position changes on the sky of order 0.5 degrees-1 degrees. The weak dependence of the results on the live versus static Milky Way model justify the use of static potentials in situations which do not require very high positional accuracy.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0004-637X			WOS:000284093700008

Aquilegia species are closely related and their distribution covers highly diverse habitats. These provide rich resources to better understand the genetic basis of adaptation to different pollinators and habitats that in turn leads to rapid speciation. To gain insights into the genome structure and facilitate gene identification, comparative genomics and whole-genome shotgun sequencing assembly, BAC-based genomics resources are of crucial importance.Results: BAC-based genomic resources, including two BAC libraries, a physical map with anchored markers and BAC end sequences, were established from A. formosa. The physical map was composed of a total of 50,155 BAC clones in 832 contigs and 3939 singletons, covering 21X genome equivalents. These contigs spanned a physical length of 689.8 Mb (similar to 2.3X of the genome) suggesting the complex heterozygosity of the genome. A set of 197 markers was developed from ESTs induced by drought-stress, or involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis or floral development, and was integrated into the physical map. Among these were 87 genetically mapped markers that anchored 54 contigs, spanning 76.4 Mb (25.5%) across the genome. Analysis of a selection of 12,086 BAC end sequences (BESs) from the minimal tiling path (MTP) allowed a preview of the Aquilegia genome organization, including identification of transposable elements, simple sequence repeats and gene content. Common repetitive elements previously reported in both monocots and core eudicots were identified in Aquilegia suggesting the value of this genome in connecting the two major plant clades. Comparison with sequenced plant genomes indicated a higher similarity to grapevine (Vitis vinifera) than to rice and Arabidopsis in the transcriptomes.Conclusions: The A. formosa BAC-based genomic resources provide valuable tools to study Aquilegia genome. Further integration of other existing genomics resources, such as ESTs, into the physical map should enable better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptive radiation and elaboration of floral morphology.									7	0	0	7	0	7			1471-2164			WOS:000284579800001	21059242

Injection of solids to lift coastal areas								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES				466	2123			3225	3252		10.1098/rspa.2010.0033			NOV 8 2010	2010	Catastrophic flooding in coastal areas is an ongoing problem that may be aggravated by projected sea-level rise. We present a method of flood protection called SIRGE (solid injection for raising ground elevation), where the ground surface is raised by injecting sediment-laden slurry into hydraulic fractures at shallow depths. The injection process is repeated at adjacent locations to create a network of sub-horizontal, overlapping injections of solid material (hydraulic fractures). We argue that injecting sediment over large lateral distances would cause a lasting surface uplift that scales with the thickness of injected sediment at depth. We support this concept by an analysis showing that, in contrast to hydraulic fractures in petroleum reservoirs, hydraulic fractures in soft, shallow formations would typically grow in the toughness-dominated regime. It appears that the SIRGE process could be implemented to lift ground elevations in places such as Venice or New Orleans. Experimental and geological examples indicate that hydraulic fractures of suitable orientation and size can be created in areas with appropriate in situ stresses.									6	0	0	0	0	6			1364-5021			WOS:000282142900007

They exhibit several important characteristics for experimentally demanding in vitro and in vivo fluorescence studies, such as their high brightness, fast emission rate, excellent photostability, nonblinking, and nontoxic feature. However, controlling the surface chemistry and bioconjugation of Pdots has been a challenging problem that prevented their widespread applications in biological studies. Here, we report a facile yet powerful conjugation method that overcomes this challenge. Our strategy for Pdot functionalization is based on entrapping heterogeneous polymer chains into a single dot, driven by hydrophobic interactions during nanoparticle formation. A small amount of amphiphilic polymer bearing functional groups is co-condensed with the majority of semiconducting polymers to modify and functionalize the nanoparticle surface for subsequent covalent conjugation to biomolecules, such as streptavidin and immunoglobulin G (IgG). The Pdot bioconjugates can effectively and specifically label cellular targets, such as cell surface marker in human breast cancer cells, without any detectable nonspecific binding. Single-particle imaging, cellular imaging, and flow cytometry experiments indicate a much higher fluorescence brightness of Pdots compared to those of Alexa dye and quantum dot probes. The successful bioconjugation of these ultrabright nanoparticles presents a novel opportunity to apply versatile semiconducting polymers to various fluorescence measurements in modern biology and biomedicine.									223	7	0	44	0	225			0002-7863			WOS:000283621700056	20929226

Although several machine learning methods have been reported for predicting protein stability changes upon amino acid substitutions, the previous studies did not utilize relevant sequence features representing biological knowledge for classifier construction.Results: In this study, a new machine learning method has been developed for sequence feature-based prediction of protein stability changes upon amino acid substitutions. Support vector machines were trained with data from experimental studies on the free energy change of protein stability upon mutations. To construct accurate classifiers, twenty sequence features were examined for input vector encoding. It was shown that classifier performance varied significantly by using different sequence features. The most accurate classifier in this study was constructed using a combination of six sequence features. This classifier achieved an overall accuracy of 84.59% with 70.29% sensitivity and 90.98% specificity.Conclusions: Relevant sequence features can be used to accurately predict protein stability changes upon amino acid substitutions. Predictive results at this level of accuracy may provide useful information to distinguish between deleterious and tolerant alterations in disease candidate genes. To make the classifier accessible to the genetics research community, we have developed a new web server, called MuStab (http://bioinfo.ggc.org/mustab/).									19	0	0	15	1	21			1471-2164			WOS:000289200100005	21047386

However, the effective use of public microarray data requires integrating the expression profiles from heterogeneous sources.Results: In this study, we have compiled a compendium of microarray expression profiles of various human tissue samples. The microarray raw data generated in different research laboratories have been obtained and combined into a single dataset after data normalization and transformation. To demonstrate the usefulness of the integrated microarray data for studying human gene expression patterns, we have analyzed the dataset to identify potential tissue-selective genes. A new method has been proposed for genome-wide identification of tissue-selective gene targets using both microarray intensity values and detection calls. The candidate genes for brain, liver and testis-selective expression have been examined, and the results suggest that our approach can select some interesting gene targets for further experimental studies.Conclusion: A computational approach has been developed in this study for combining microarray expression profiles from heterogeneous sources. The integrated microarray data can be used to investigate tissue-selective expression patterns of human genes.									8	1	0	8	0	8			1471-2164			WOS:000289200100015	21047382	
J	Grujicic, M.; Xie, X.; Arakere, G.; Grujicic, A.; Wagner, D. W.; Vallejo, A.					Wagner, David/0000-0002-0247-1637			Design-Optimization and Material Selection for a Proximal Radius Fracture-Fixation Implant								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				19	8			1090	1103		10.1007/s11665-009-9591-7			NOV 2010	2010	The problem of optimal size, shape, and placement of a proximal radius-fracture fixation-plate is addressed computationally using a combined finite-element/design-optimization procedure. To expand the set of physiological loading conditions experienced by the implant during normal everyday activities of the patient, beyond those typically covered by the pre-clinical implant-evaluation testing procedures, the case of a wheel-chair push exertion is considered. Toward that end, a musculoskeletal multi-body inverse-dynamics analysis is carried out of a human propelling a wheelchair. The results obtained are used as input to a finite-element structural analysis for evaluation of the maximum stress and fatigue life of the parametrically defined implant design. While optimizing the design of the radius-fracture fixation-plate, realistic functional requirements pertaining to the attainment of the required level of the devise safety factor and longevity/lifecycle were considered. It is argued that the type of analyses employed in the present work should be: (a) used to complement the standard experimental pre-clinical implant-evaluation tests (the tests which normally include a limited number of daily-living physiological loading conditions and which rely on single pass/fail outcomes/decisions with respect to a set of lower-bound implant-performance criteria) and (b) integrated early in the implant design and material/manufacturing-route selection process.									6	0	0	2	0	6			1059-9495			WOS:000283307900002		
J	Denny, Joel E.; Malloy, Brian A.								The IELR(1) algorithm for generating minimal LR(1) parser tables for non-LR(1) grammars with conflict resolution								SCIENCE OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING				75	11	SI		943	979		10.1016/j.scico.2009.08.001			NOV 1 2010	2010	There has been a recent effort in the literature to reconsider grammar-dependent software development from an engineering point of view. As part of that effort, we examine a deficiency in the state of the art of practical LR parser table generation. Specifically, LALR sometimes generates parser tables that do not accept the full language that the grammar developer expects, but canonical LR is too inefficient to be practical particularly during grammar development. In response, many researchers have attempted to develop minimal LR parser table generation algorithms. In this paper, we demonstrate that a well known algorithm described by David Pager and implemented in Menhir, the most robust minimal LR(1) implementation we have discovered, does not always achieve the full power of canonical LR(1) when the given grammar is non-LR(1) coupled with a specification for resolving conflicts. We also detail an original minimal LR(1) algorithm, IELR(1) (Inadequacy Elimination LR(1)), which we have implemented as an extension of GNU Bison and which does not exhibit this deficiency. Using our implementation, we demonstrate the relevance of this deficiency for several real-world parser specifications, and we demonstrate the feasibility of IELR(1). Finally, we demonstrate that, if canonical LR(1) were employed instead, grammar development would be severely impeded regardless of the power of the computer hardware. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The range of fineness modulus of the sands fully encompassed the range of sands normally used in concretes. The concretes were batched at w/c ratios of 0.30 and 0.50 and cured for various periods before carrying out determinations of mechanical properties and of "rapid chloride permeability". The conventional notions of the effect of the ITZ on concrete properties would predict that a reduction in strength and an increase in chloride permeability would accompany increased ITZ interfacial area and closer spacing between sand grains. In general, no such influence was found. It appears from this research that the traditional notions of the adverse influence of the ITZ on the properties of conventional concretes may not be accurate, within the realms of conventional concrete and typical inter-aggregate spacings.

Hyperhydricity and Flavonoid Content of Scutellaria Species In Vitro on Polyester-supported Liquid Culture Systems								HORTSCIENCE				45	11			1723	1728					NOV 2010	2010	Three Scutellaria species (Scutellaria lateriflora,S. costaricana, and S. baicalensis) were grown in different in vitro physical environments: agar, liquid culture, and liquid culture with fiber-supported paper (with initial media volumes of 20 mL and 30 mL). During an 8-week time course, tissue growth was assessed for each species by fresh weight (FW), dry weight (DW), percent DW, and multiplication ratio. Water use and hyper-hydricity were also compared. Scutellaria lateriflora plantlets grown in liquid were hyperhydric despite the greatest accumulation of dry mass, but multiplication diminished with time as plants became hyperhydric. In contrast, S. costaricana and S. baicalensis plantlets had higher FW and DW on agar. With all Scutellaria species tested, plantlets grown on agar or fiber-supported paper were not hyperhydric, and fiber-supported paper with 20 mL initial volume yielded plants with the greatest percent DW. The lowered hyperhydricity was related to reduced water uptake. The flavonoids baicalin, baicalein, and wogonin were quantified in plants grown on fiber-supported paper culture. The baicalin concentrations in in vitro cultured S. lateriflora shoots was comparable to those of field-grown plants. The in vitro method presented a unique opportunity to enhance baicalein content and produce wogonin-rich roots. S. costaricana plantlets in vitro showed high levels of the three flavonoids compared with S. baicalensis and S. lateriflora. Growing non-hyperhydric tissues on fiber-supported paper, in vitro, allowed the clonal propagation of Scutellaria species with increased flavonoid content to proceed in a simple, controlled environment.									5	0	0	4	0	5			0018-5345			WOS:000284196300027		
J	Li, C.; Gong, F.; Wang, P.								Analysis and design of a high-Q differential active inductor with wide tuning range								IET CIRCUITS DEVICES & SYSTEMS				4	6			486	495		10.1049/iet-cds.2010.0011			NOV 2010	2010	The analysis and design of a high-Q differential active inductor with wide tuning range is presented in this study. The self-resonant frequency (SRF) and quality factor (Q) of the inductor can be tuned independently. The inductor was implemented in a 0.13 mu m CMOS process. The measured SRF is tunable from 0.5 to 10.2 GHz. The obtained maximum quality factor is as high as 3000. The analysis shows that higher inductance corresponds to higher inductor noise while the correlation between quality factor and noise is relatively weak. Measurement results confirmed these predictions. The measured results show that this inductor structure is suitable for broadband reconfigurable radio-frequency system development. Further analysis and measurements show that the inductor is intrinsically non-linear, so are gyrator-C-based active inductors in general. A compensation circuit is proposed to improve the linearity characteristics of such inductors.									7	0	0	0	0	7			1751-858X			WOS:000283849200003

Drawing from the literature in marketing, strategic management, and information systems, the first outcome is a theoretically grounded conceptualization of CRM technology capability comprised of three complementary resources: technology, business, and human resources. The second key finding is that CRM technology capability and customer orientation have a positive association with the development of durable customer relationships. These resources also have a positive interactive effect on customer-linking capability, highlighting the importance of aligning strategic business and technology resources. Finally, the authors find that customer-linking capability has a positive relationship with customer relationship performance and that the rapidity of changes in the external environment moderates this relationship. This study addresses these research questions in a cross-sectional study of 215 organizations using a partial least squares modeling approach. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

J	Maag, John W.; Katsiyannis, Antonis								Early Intervention Programs for Children With Behavior Problems and At Risk for Developing Antisocial Behaviors: Evidence- and Research-Based Practices								REMEDIAL AND SPECIAL EDUCATION				31	6			464	475		10.1177/0741932509355992			NOV-DEC 2010	2010	The number of children who would be eligible for, and benefit from, early intervention programs has dramatically increased during the past several years. However, those programs would have to meet the U.S. Department of Education's criteria for being evidence based. Some programs that have proven successful would not be eligible but rather be considered data based by educational researchers. The purpose of this article is to review the major early intervention programs for children at risk for developing conduct problems and to determine which ones could be considered evidence based, research based, or neither. Issues related to determining whether a program is evidence based versus data based are presented, along with those addressing program efficacy and access for eligible children.									7	0	0	1	0	7			0741-9325			WOS:000283887500006		
J	Kim, Hak-Seo; Lee, Soon-Jae; Amirkhanian, Serji								Rheology investigation of crumb rubber modified asphalt binders								KSCE JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING				14	6			839	843		10.1007/s12205-010-1020-9			NOV 2010	2010	The incorporation of crumb rubber into asphalt pavement mixes is designed to enhance binder properties through reducing the binder's inherent temperature susceptibility. During the interaction process, crumb rubber particles swell after absorbing a portion of the oils in the binder, resulting in the increase of binder viscosity. In this study, the Crumb Rubber Modified (CRM) asphalt binders were produced using virgin binder of Performance Grade (PG) 64-22 and ambient rubber with various concentrations (10%, 15%, and 20% by weight of virgin binder) in the laboratory. Rheological analyses (flow behavior, elasticity, loading dependence, and temperature dependence) of the control virgin binder and the CRM binders were conducted using a Bohlin Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR) II. The results indicated that (1) the use of crumb rubber as a modifier seemed to improve the penetration resistance of the asphalt binder because of the increased viscosity at 60oC, (2) its advantage was more apparent at lower frequencies of loading, and (3) the asphalt binder with higher crumb rubber contents was observed to have better resistance to permanent deformation at higher temperatures and elasticity at lower temperatures.									4	2	0	0	0	6			1226-7988			WOS:000283592200005		
J	Neptune, Andrew I.; Putman, Bradley J.								Effect of Aggregate Size and Gradation on Pervious Concrete Mixtures								ACI MATERIALS JOURNAL				107	6			625	631					NOV-DEC 2010	2010	The purpose of this research was to determine the effects of aggregate size and gradation on the unit weight, strength, porosity, and permeability of pervious concrete mixtures. The water-cement ratio (w/c) and cement-aggregate ratio (c/a) were kept constant at 0.29 and 0.22, respectively, with a design unit weight of 2002 kg/m(3)(125 lb/ft(3)). Fifteen different aggregate gradations were tested and categorized according to nominal maximum aggregate sizes (NMASs) of 9.5, 12.5, and 19.0 mm (0.38, 0.49, and 0.75 in.) and had a range of uniformity coefficients C(u). The results indicated that as the porosity increased, strength decreased and permeability increased. In general, as the C(u) of the aggregate increased-that is, the gradation became less uniform or single-sized and more well-graded-the strength also increased, whereas the porosity and permeability decreased. There appeared to be an optimum/pessimum C(u) range in which the strength of the pervious concrete reached a maximum and the permeability reached a minimum.									6	1	0	0	0	7			0889-325X			WOS:000285270700011

However, the formation of stable Si anodes is a challenge because of significant volume changes occuring during their electrochemical alloying and dealloying with Li. Binder selection and optimization may allow significant improvements in the stability of Si-based anodes. Most studies of Si anodes have involved the use of carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) binders. Herein, we show for the first time that pure poly(acryllic acid) (PAA), possessing certain mechanical properties comparable to those of CMC but containing a higher concentration of carboxylic functional groups, may offer superior performance as a binder for Si anodes. We further show the positive impact of carbon coating on the stability of the anode. The carbon-coated Si nanopowder anodes, tested between 0.01 and 1 V vs Li/Li+ and containing as little as 15 wt% of PAA, showed excellent stability during the first hundred cycles. The results obtained open new avenues to explore a novel series of binders from the polyvinyl acids (PVA) family.									260	11	0	10	0	267			1944-8244			WOS:000284454400010	21053920

As is well established in the literature, polyelectrolytes are in general good dispersion agents for single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) which are otherwise in bundles because of strong van der Waals interactions. We report here a study in which GOs were used to disperse SWNTs both as-purified and separated semiconducting SWNTs, for solution-like homogeneous suspensions. As a demonstration for their potentials, the optically transparent dispersions were used in a more accurate determination of the absorptivities for the band-gap transitions in semiconducting SWNTs. Results on exploration of the use of the GO-dispersed SWNTs in the development of unique carbon nanocomposite materials are also presented and discussed.									64	5	0	3	0	67			1944-8244			WOS:000284454400036	20942436	
J	Chen, Guihua; Wiatrak, Pawel								Soybean Development and Yield Are Influenced by Planting Date and Environmental Conditions in the Southeastern Coastal Plain, United States								AGRONOMY JOURNAL				102	6			1731	1737		10.2134/agronj2010.0219			NOV-DEC 2010	2010	Variation of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr] growth and yield with planting date may be a response to changes in the plant, the environment, or a combination of both. This 2-yr experiment studied the effects of planting date on durations of vegetative and reproductive stages, and duration, temperature, and precipitation on yield of five soybean cultivars each representing a maturity group (MG IV-VIII) under dryland conditions. Planting dates were scheduled for 14-d intervals from late April to mid-July, 2008 and 2009. Length of growing season shortened with later planting dates, and the shortening was greater for vegetative stages compared with reproductive stages, especially for later MGs. Duration of flowering decreased with later planting date more rapidly for MG V through VIII (-0.60 to 1.18 d per planting date delay) than MG IV (insignificant). Pod-set duration declined with later planting date slowly for all MGs and insignificantly for MG IV and V in 2008. There was no conclusive relationship between seed-fill duration and later planting date. Duration of vegetative stage was positively correlated with yield of each MG. At flowering stage, yield of MG IV was positively correlated with temperature, while yields of MG V to VIII were positively correlated with duration, temperature, and precipitation. Precipitation during pod-set was the main factor in determining yields of all MGs. Temperature during seed-fill was positively correlated with yields of all MGs. These results suggest that May planting dates would achieve greater yield potential for all MGs by extending duration of development stages and avoiding cooler temperature during seed-fill.									12	2	0	10	1	14			0002-1962			WOS:000284787300024

The accuracy and robustness of this method was validated using computer-simulated FRAP experiments. This method was applied to determine the region-dependent anisotropic diffusion tensor in porcine temporomandibular joint (TMJ) discs. The average characteristic diffusivity of 4 kDa FITC-Dextran across the disc was 26.05 +/- A 4.32 mu m(2)/s which is about 16% of its diffusivity in water. In the anteroposterior direction, the anterior region (30.99 +/- A 5.93 mu m(2)/s) had significantly higher characteristic diffusivity than the intermediate region (20.49 +/- A 5.38 mu m(2)/s) and posterior region (20.97 +/- A 2.46 mu m(2)/s). The ratio of the two principal diffusivities represents the anisotropy of the diffusion and ranged between 0.45 and 0.51 (1.0 = isotropic). Our results indicated that the solute diffusion in TMJ discs is inhomogenous and anisotropic. These findings suggested that diffusive transport in the TMJ disc is dependent on tissue composition (e.g., water content) and structure (e.g., collagen orientation). This study provides a new method to quantitatively investigate the relationship between solute transport properties and tissue composition and structure.									6	0	0	3	0	6			0090-6964			WOS:000282506400012	20582475

Initially, a microtiter plate assay using a Bioscreen C Microbiology Plate Reader was used for rapid optimization of culture conditions. Various treatments were examined in efforts to optimize nisin production from SW, including different methods for SW sterilization, ultrasonication of soy flake slurries for possible nutrient release, comparison of diluted and undiluted SW, and supplementation of SW with nutrients. In subsequent flask-based experiments, dry bacterial mass and nisin yields obtained from SW were 2.18 g/L and 619 mg/L, respectively, as compared to 2.17 g/L and 672 mg/L from a complex medium, de Man-Rogosa-Sharpe broth. Ultrasonication of soybean flake slurries (10% solid content) in water prior to production of SW resulted in similar to 2% increase in biomass yields and similar to 1% decrease in nisin yields. Nutrient supplementation to SW resulted in similar to 3% and similar to 7% increase in cell and nisin yields, respectively. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the potential for use of a low/negative value liquid waste stream from soybean processing for production of a high-value fermentation end product.									5	0	0	3	0	5			0273-2289			WOS:000282315100001	20853068

Therefore, the goal of this paper is to develop a method of selecting multiple optimal transitions for the measurement of nonuniform temperature distributions based on absorption spectroscopy. Previously developed methods are largely restricted to the relatively simple case of selecting two transitions for uniform distributions. Our new method addresses the restrictions of previous methods and is applicable to more general cases. The method was validated using both numerical tests and experimental results and is expected to be useful in the design of sensors based on multispectral absorption spectroscopy.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0003-7028	1943-3530		WOS:000284297000012	21073797

Classical novae (CNe) have recently been reported to represent the major class of supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs) in the central region of our neighbour galaxy M 31.Aims. We carried out a dedicated monitoring of the M 31 central region with XMM-Newton and Chandra in order to find SSS counterparts of CNe, determine the duration of their SSS phase and derive physical outburst parameters.Methods. We systematically searched our data for X-ray counterparts of CNe and determined their X-ray light curves and spectral properties. Additionally, we determined luminosity upper limits for all novae from previous studies which are not detected anymore and for all CNe in our field of view with optical outbursts between May 2005 and March 2007.Results. We detected eight X-ray counterparts of CNe in M 31, four of which were not previously known. Seven sources can be classified as SSSs, one is a candidate SSS. Two SSSs are still visible more than nine years after the nova outburst, whereas two other nova counterparts show a short SSS phase of less than 150 days. Of the latter sources, M31N 2006-04a exhibits a short-time variable X-ray light curve with an apparent period of (1.6 +/- 0.3) h. This periodicity could indicate the binary period of the system. There is no X-ray detection for 23 out of 25 CNe which were within the field of view of our observations and had their outburst from about one year before the start of the monitoring until its end. From the 14 SSS nova counterparts known from previous studies, ten are not detected anymore. Additionally, we found four SSSs in our XMM-Newton data without a nova counterpart, one of which is a new source.Conclusions. Out of eleven SSSs detected in our monitoring, seven are counterparts of CNe. We therefore confirm the earlier finding that CNe are the major class of SSSs in the central region of M 31.

The corn fiber was pretreated with: (i) 2% NaOH (w/w) at 30 degrees C for 2 h and (ii) steaming at 100 degrees C for 2 h. Ethanol yields were 2.6 g. 2.9 g and 5.5 g ethanol/100 g of corn fiber, respectively, for Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Gloeophyllum trabeum and Trichoderma reesei saccharification and sequential SSFs. SSF with commercial cellulase enzyme - Spezyme-CP had 7.7 g ethanol/100 g corn fiber. Mild alkali pretreatment resulted in higher glucose yields following fungal saccharification of corn fiber. However, the ethanol yields were comparatively similar for untreated and mild alkali pretreated corn fiber. Solid-substrate fermentation of corn fiber with fungi can be improved to either eliminate or reduce the dosage of commercial cellulase enzymes during SSF. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The uses of RAP and rubberized asphalt in the past have proven to be economical, environmentally sound, and effective in hot mix asphalt (HMA) mixtures across the US and the world. The objective of this research was to investigate the binder and mixture performance characteristics of these modified asphalt mixtures through a series of laboratory tests to evaluate properties such as the fatigue factor G*sin delta, rutting resistance, resilient modulus, and fatigue life. The results of the experiments indicated that the use of RAP and crumb rubber in HMA can effectively improve the engineering properties of these mixes.									1	2	0	0	0	3			0315-1468			WOS:000283304300003

FORAGING PROFICIENCY DURING THE NONBREEDING SEASON OF A SPECIALIZED FORAGER: ARE JUVENILE AMERICAN OYSTERCATCHERS "BUMBLE-BEAKS" COMPARED TO ADULTS?								CONDOR				112	4			670	675		10.1525/cond.2010.100031			NOV 2010	2010	In many species, immature individuals are less proficient at foraging than are adults, and this difference may be especially critical during winter when survival can be at its minimum. We investigated the foraging proficiency of adult and immature American Oystercatchers (Haematopus palliatus) during the nonbreeding season. Oystercatchers forage on prey that must be handled with specialized skills, so age-related differences in foraging behavior may be expected. We found that adults spent more time searching than did immatures, a trend toward immatures taking longer to handle prey than did adults, and immatures more often handling prey unsuccessfully than did adults. Feeding rates and diet composition did not differ by age class. We posit that the immature birds traded off longer handling times with shorter searching times and that ultimately the abundant prey in the region may contribute to the ability of immature birds to feed at rates similar to those of adults.									5	0	0	5	0	6			0010-5422			WOS:000285727700005

The time span between the beginning of mixing the materials until the time of finishing compacting, is one of the parameters effecting the RCC properties. In this paper, effect of changing the time span between mixing and compacting on the mechanical properties of conventional concrete and RCC containing ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) was studied. Results shows that the greater the delay in compacting, increased the loss in conventional concrete properties, but by using GGBFS as a part of the cementitious material, more delay in compacting not only does not cause the loss of properties, but, in some conditions, improved the concrete compressive strength, permeability, absorption and adsorption.

The Positive Action for Today's Health (PATH) trial compares three communities that are randomly assigned to different levels of an environmental intervention to improve safety and access for walking in low income communities.Design and setting: Three communities matched on census tract information (crime, PA, ethnic minorities, and income) were randomized to receive either: an intervention that combines a police-patrolled-walking program with social marketing strategies to promote PA, a police-patrolled-walking only intervention, or no-walking intervention (general health education only). Measures include PA (7-day accelerometer estimates), body composition, blood pressure, psychosocial measures, and perceptions of safety and access for PA at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.Intervention: The police-patrolled walking plus social marketing intervention targets increasing safety (training community leaders as walking captains, hiring off-duty police officers to patrol the walking trail, and containing stray dogs), increasing access for PA (marking a walking route), and utilizes a social marketing campaign that targets psychosocial and environmental mediators for increasing PA.Main hypotheses/outcomes: It is hypothesized that the police-patrolled walking plus social marketing intervention will result in greater increases in moderate-to-vigorous PA as compared to the police-patrolled-walking only or the general health intervention after 12 months and that this effect will be maintained at 18 and 24 months.Conclusions: Implications of this community-based trial are discussed.

To operate the LNT with high conversion efficiency, an optimized regeneration schedule is required, together with closed-loop control of the air/fuel ratio during regeneration. Furthermore, to comply with emissions regulations, diagnostic schemes are needed to detect and isolate faults, typically related to aging, sulfur poisoning and thermal deactivation.The paper describes a step-by-step methodology for the design and validation of model-based fault diagnosis for a LNT aftertreatment system. The approach is based on a control-oriented model of the LNT validated with experimental data.The proposed diagnostic approach is based on the generation of residuals using system models, through the comparison of the predicted and measured values of selected output variables. The paper focuses on the detection and isolation of sensor faults and LNT parametric faults. Different diagnostic methodologies are presented in relation to the detection of specific faults.Starting from sulfur poisoning detection in a laboratory environment which represents a preliminary validation of the approach, the diagnostic scheme is extended to detect various faults under different plant configurations and operating conditions, with a final application to on-board fault detection and isolation.

The Use of Root Gall Ratings to Determine High Risk Zones in Cotton Fields Infested by Meloidogyne incognita								CROP SCIENCE				50	6			2575	2579		10.2135/cropsci2010.02.0054			NOV-DEC 2010	2010	Farmers growing cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) need a reliable, accurate, and inexpensive method for mapping areas of potentially high risk from root-knot nematodes (RKN) [Meloidogyne incognita (Kofoid & White) Chitwood] within individual fields for site-specific application of nematicides. Evaluation of postharvest cotton roots for galling severity due to RKN may be an alternative to soil analysis for nematodes for developing these maps. The main objectives of this study were to determine the relationship between yield of cotton and root galling severity the year before planting, and the estimated costs per hectare for rating root galling severity compared with that of conventional soil sampling using a 15-m grid spacing. There was a significant negative correlation between root galling severity in October and cotton yield the next 2 yr, indicating galling severity may be a useful indicator of the potential threat of RKN to crop performance for more than 1 yr. The estimated costs for assessing galling severity, $183 ha(-1), were much less than for soil analysis for nematodes, $968 ha(-1). Unfortunately, maps based on galling severity will only be useful guides for site-specific application of nematicides if RKN is the only economically important cotton parasitic nematode present. More accurate and less expensive ways of sampling for RKN are needed to identify within-field areas where the risk of nematode-induced yield loss is high.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0011-183X			WOS:000284134000040

The model emphasizes the role of political entry and deadweight costs of taxation on the joint determination of these economic and political outcomes. Contrary to popular belief, my model shows that natural resource abundance is an economic blessing even in a rent-seeking society, although resource dependence can be negatively associated with economic performance. In a contested political market, dictators care about popular support and hence resource wealth can help reduce the deadweight cost of taxation (and hence the cost of public good provision). On the other hand, natural resource wealth can be a political curse, because it encourages political entry and hence it induces incumbent dictators to run more repressive regimes. With constant returns counterinsurgent technology, however, the equilibrium number of insurgents is independent of the size of resource wealth. The onset of civil war, therefore, depends on the counterinsurgent technology and whether the costs of entry deterrence are affected by resource wealth. This helps clarify the two seemingly contradictory hypotheses that "resource wealth enhances regime durability'' and "resource wealth fuels conflict.''									11	0	0	0	0	11			0954-1985	1468-0343		WOS:000294306800010

This enhanced stability is likely to lead to an increased residence time in the water column and increased exposure times for pelagic organisms. In the current study. NOM from three different river systems in the southeast United States increased the stability of MWNT suspensions The effects of these suspensions were evaluated using acute and chronic bioassays with Daphnia magna and Ceriodaphnia dubia The 96-h LC50 for D. magna exposed to MWNTs suspended in Suwannee River (USA) NOM was approximately 2.0 mg/L and was not significantly influenced by NOM concentrations ranging from 1.79 to 18.5 mg/L DOC However, there were differences in 96-h LC50 values among different sources of NOM (Suwannee, Black, and Edisto Rivers, USA) Daphnid growth was reduced in both D magna and C dubia, whereas reproduction was reduced in C dubia Characterization of the different NOM sources and MWNT suspensions was conducted Visual inspection using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and gut elimination observations suggested that the toxicity was attributable to ingested MWNTs clogging the gut tract of D magna The TEM micrographs indicated that MWNTs can disaggregate within the gut tract, but single, MWNTs are unable to absorb across the gut lumen Environ.

J	Heringa, Spencer; Kim, Jinkyung; Shepherd, Marion W., Jr.; Singh, Randhir; Jiang, Xiuping								The Presence of Antibiotic Resistance and Integrons in Escherichia coli Isolated from Compost								FOODBORNE PATHOGENS AND DISEASE				7	11			1297	1304		10.1089/fpd.2010.0544			NOV 2010	2010	The compost microcosm is a prime site for bacterial interaction that carries the inherent potential for disseminating antibiotic resistance through genetic exchange and subsequent land application. One hundred and thirty-six Escherichia coli isolates from compost heaps in South Carolina and California from a total of 277 compost samples were classified to phylogenetic groups, tested for resistance to 10 antibiotics, and screened for shiga toxins and integrons. Isolates that had identical antibiotic resistance patterns, grouped phylogenetically, and came from the same sample source were tested with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. All isolates were negative for shiga toxins 1 and 2 as determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Resistance phenotypes comprised various combinations of seven antibiotics with a prevalence of ampicillin resistance in 63% of isolates (n = 56) from California, and tetracycline resistance in 37% of isolates (n = 62) from South Carolina. This disparity may be attributed to the differences in regional application of antibiotics as well as the origin of the waste materials in the compost itself. Phylogenetic PCR revealed that the majority of E. coli isolates (64%) belonged to groups A or B1. However, among these isolates, only 7% were resistant to two or more antibiotics as compared with 35% of isolates belonging to groups B2 and D. Integron detection by PCR revealed that nine (7.6%) E. coli isolates were positive for class I integrons, with six of the nine detected in isolates from groups B2 or D. Sequenced integrons (n = 5) were found to carry genes aadA, conferring reduced susceptibility to streptomycin, and dfrA, conferring resistance to trimethoprim. Our results suggest that E. coli isolates in compost belonging to phylogenetic groups B2 and D are more likely to contain integrons and higher levels of antibiotic resistance. The presence of multiple antibiotic resistances as well as integrons in E. coli implicates the potential for antibiotic resistance spread in the compost environment.									6	0	0	4	0	6			1535-3141			WOS:000283845800003	20617935

The results show that the soil behaviour type index (I-c), either defined by Jefferies and Been (denoted herein as I-c,(BJ)) or by Robertson and Wride (denoted herein as I-c,(RW)), is an effective parameter for mechanical behaviour classification. Additionally, an effort is made to find the most suitable I-c cut-off (or boundary) value that can delineate cohesionless (sand-like) soils from cohesive (clay-like) soils. The Robertson and Wride's formulation, I-c,(RW) 2.67 is found capable of delineating these two classes of soils. Similarly for the Been and Jefferies' formulation, I-c,I-BJ 2.58 is found to be the most suitable I-c cut-off value for such classification purpose. These cutoff I-c values for distinguishing sand-like soils from claylike soils are found to be reliable in a case study of liquefaction susceptibility.									10	1	0	0	0	11			0016-8505			WOS:000283061300004

Model results show that groundwater flow in fractures does not significantly affect the minimum treatment zone temperature, except near the beginning of heating or when groundwater influx is high. However, fracture and rock matrix properties can significantly influence the time necessary to remove all liquid water (i.e., reach superheated steam conditions) in the treatment area. Low matrix permeability, high matrix porosity, and wide fracture spacing can contribute to boiling point elevation in the rock matrix. Consequently, knowledge of these properties is important for the estimation of treatment times. Because of the variability in boiling point throughout a fractured rock treatment zone and the absence of a well-defined constant temperature boiling plateau in the rock matrix, it may be difficult to monitor the progress of thermal treatment using temperature measurements alone.									5	0	0	3	0	5			0017-467X			WOS:000283828300013	20550586

Gene copy number evolution during tetraploid cotton radiation								HEREDITY				105	5			463	472		10.1038/hdy.2009.192			NOV 2010	2010	After polyploid formation, retention or loss of duplicated genes is not random. Genes with some functional domains are convergently restored to 'singleton' state after many independent genome duplications, and have been referred to as 'duplication-resistant' (DR) genes. To further explore the timeframe for their restoration to the singleton state, 27 cotton homologs of genes found to be 'DR' in Arabidopsis were selected based on diagnostic Pfam domains. Their copy numbers were studied using southern hybridization and sequence analysis in five tetraploid species and their ancestral A and D genome diploids. DR genes had significantly lower copy number than gene families hybridizing to randomly selected cotton ESTs. Three DR genes showed complete loss of D genome-derived homoeologs in some or all tetraploid species. Prior analysis has shown gene loss in polyploid cotton to be rare, and herein only one randomly selected gene showed loss of a homoeolog in only one of the five tetraploid species (Gossypium mustelinum). BAC sequencing confirmed two cases of gene loss in tetraploid cotton. Divergence among 50 sequences of DR genes amplified from G. arboreum, G. raimondii, and Gossypioides kirkii was correlated with gene copy number. These results show that genes containing Pfam domains associated with duplication resistance in Arabidopsis have also been preferentially restored to low copy number after a more recent polyploidization event in cotton. In tetraploid cotton, genes from the progenitor D genome seem to experience more gene copy number divergence than genes from the A genome. Together with D subgenome-biased alterations in gene expression, perhaps gene loss may contribute to the relatively larger portion of quantitative trait variation attributable to D than A subgenome chromosomes of tetraploid cotton.

The ephedrine alkaloids were separated by reversed-phase chromatography using a phenyl column at room temperature. A linear gradient method with a mobile phase composition varying from 5:95 [MeOH:0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water] to 20:80 (MeOH:0.1% TFA in water) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min, with an analysis time of less than 20 min, was used. The source block temperature was evaluated to determine the optimal operating conditions by monitoring the intensities and fragmentation patterns of the ephedrine alkaloids. Ephedrine and N-methylephedrine were taken as a representative of the test alkaloids.

The Carboxysome Shell Is Permeable to Protons								JOURNAL OF BACTERIOLOGY				192	22			5881	5886		10.1128/JB.00903-10			NOV 2010	2010	Bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) are polyhedral organelles found in an increasingly wide variety of bacterial species. These structures, typified by carboxysomes of cyanobacteria and many chemoautotrophs, function to compartmentalize important reaction sequences of metabolic pathways. Unlike their eukaryotic counterparts, which are surrounded by lipid bilayer membranes, these microbial organelles are bounded by a thin protein shell that is assembled from multiple copies of a few different polypeptides. The main shell proteins form hexamers whose edges interact to create the thin sheets that form the facets of the polyhedral BMCs. Each hexamer contains a central pore hypothesized to mediate flux of metabolites into and out of the organelle. Because several distinctly different metabolic processes are found in the various BMCs studied to date, it has been proposed that a common advantage to packaging these pathways within shell-bound compartments is to optimize the concentration of volatile metabolites in the BMC by maintaining an interior pH that is lower than that of the cytoplasm. We have tested this idea by recombinantly fusing a pH-sensitive green fluorescent protein (GFP) to ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO), the major enzyme component inside the carboxysome. Our results suggest that the carboxysomal pH is similar to that of its external environment and that the protein shell does not constitute a proton barrier. The explanation for the sundry BMC functions must therefore be sought in the characteristics of the pores that traverse their shells.									11	0	0	11	0	12			0021-9193			WOS:000283559300004	20870775

Characterization of an Archaeal Medium-Chain Acyl Coenzyme A Synthetase from Methanosarcina acetivorans								JOURNAL OF BACTERIOLOGY				192	22			5982	5990		10.1128/JB.00600-10			NOV 2010	2010	Short-and medium-chain acyl coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) synthetases catalyze the formation of acyl-CoA from an acyl substrate, ATP, and CoA. These enzymes catalyze mechanistically similar two-step reactions that proceed through an enzyme-bound acyl-AMP intermediate. Here we describe the characterization of a member of this enzyme family from the methane-producing archaeon Methanosarcina acetivorans. This enzyme, a medium-chain acyl-CoA synthetase designated Macs(Ma), utilizes 2-methylbutyrate as its preferred substrate for acyl-CoA synthesis but cannot utilize acetate and thus cannot catalyze the first step of acetoclastic methano-genesis in M. acetivorans. When propionate or other less favorable acyl substrates, such as butyrate, 2-methylpropionate, or 2-methylvalerate, were utilized, the acyl-CoA was not produced or was produced at reduced levels. Instead, acyl-AMP and PP(i) were released in the absence of CoA, whereas in the presence of CoA, the intermediate was broken down into AMP and the acyl substrate, which were released along with PP(i). These results suggest that although acyl-CoA synthetases may have the ability to utilize a broad range of substrates for the acyl-adenylate-forming first step of the reaction, the intermediate may not be suitable for the thioester-forming second step. The Macs(Ma) structure has revealed the putative acyl substrate-and CoA-binding pockets. Six residues proposed to form the acyl substrate-binding pocket, Lys(256), Cys(298), Gly(351), Trp(259), Trp(237), and Trp(254), were targeted for alteration. Characterization of the enzyme variants indicates that these six residues are critical in acyl substrate binding and catalysis, and even conservative alterations significantly reduced the catalytic ability of the enzyme.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0021-9193			WOS:000283559300015	20851904	
J	Myers, Laura; Myers, Larry; Grant, Lorna								The creation of regional partnerships for regional emergency planning.								Journal of business continuity & emergency planning				4	4			338	51					2010-Nov	2010	Regional partnerships for regional emergency planning are relationships developed between disparate emergency planning stakeholders from multiple jurisdictions and with different missions. Regional partnerships are essential for the management of limited resources and for responding to large-scale disasters that can overwhelm local resources. Emergency response planners develop these partnerships as needs develop within their own jurisdictions or in response to lessons learned from previous disaster responses. This paper discusses a model process for developing or enhancing an all-hazards regional emergency planning network to create regional collaboration and resource allocation. This model process can be adapted and customised in any community to develop partnerships between communities, public agencies, non-governmental organisations, faith-based organisations and the private sector within a region. The model process and how to use it in communities will be discussed, including a qualitative analysis of its application.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1749-9216			MEDLINE:21177220	21177220

Few studies consider their joint influence and even fewer consider the temporal change of those effects on firm valuation. In this study, we propose that firm age, a key organizational variable, represents both the development of organizational routines from a start-up's perspective and the accumulation of accessible information from an investor's viewpoint As such, an investor's evaluation of a high technology start-up's innovative capability and inter-firm network evolves with firm age. Using panel data of 170 biotechnology start-ups, our results suggest that the relative value of network status declines while the impact of innovative capability increases with firm age. Interestingly, there is a growing complementary effect of innovative capability and network heterogeneity on firm valuation. The implications of these findings for entrepreneurial practice and theories of firm capabilities and inter-firm network are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Hydrothermal crystal growth of fresnoite								JOURNAL OF CRYSTAL GROWTH				312	22			3395	3400		10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2010.08.023			NOV 1 2010	2010	The growth of fresnoite, Ba(2)TiSi(2)O(8), by hydrothermal synthesis has led to spontaneous generation of large, (4-5 mm) optically clear crystals from 6 M KF mineralizer solutions. Growth was achieved at relatively low synthesis temperatures (575 degrees C) comparative to fresnoite synthesis by Czochralski or flux methods. Bulk crystal growth possibilities were explored by transport reactions performed in both fluoride and hydroxide mineralizers with 25-45 degrees C temperature gradients. Growth rates of 0.14 x 0.19 x 0.22 mm(3)/week were established in 6 M KOH, which is significantly slower than standard hydrothermal rates of 1 mm/week. Although relatively slow, the hydrothermal method has been demonstrated as a synthesis route to high quality single crystals of fresnoite. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Characterization of glucagon-like peptide 2 pathway member expression in bovine gastrointestinal tract								JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE				93	11			5167	5178		10.3168/jds.2010-3205			NOV 2010	2010	Glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2), secreted by enteroendocrine cells, has several physiological effects on the intestine of monogastric species, including promotion of growth of intestinal epithelium; reduction of epithelial cell apoptosis, and enhancement of intestinal blood flow; nutrient absorption, and epithelial barrier function. The regulatory functions of GLP-2 in the ruminant gastrointestinal tract (GIT) have not been well studied. The objectives of this investigation were to characterize the miRNA expression of 4 members of the GLP-2 pathway throughout the bovine GIT, including (1) proglucagon (GCG); the parent peptide from which GLP-2 is derived through cleavage by prohormone convertase; (2) prohormone convertase (PCSK1); (3) GLP-2 receptor (GLP2R); and (4) dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP4), the enzyme that inactivates GLP-2. Gene expression was evaluated in rumen, reticulum, omasum, abomasum; duodenum; jejunum, ileum; cecum; and rectum collected at slaughter from prepubertal heifers, mature cows in early, mid; and late lactation, and non-lactating cows (n = 3 per stage) by a gene expression profiling assay. In addition, mRNA expression of 14 genes involved in nutrient transport, enzyme activity, blood flow, apoptosis, and proliferation were evaluated in the 9 GIT tissues for their association with GCG; and GLP2R mRNA expression. Immunohistochemistry was used to localize GLP2R. protein in tissues of the lower GIT. Results indicated that mRNA expression of GCG, PCSK1, GLP2R, and DPP4 varies across the 9 GIT tissues, with greatest expression in small and large intestines; and generally nondetectable levels in forestomachs. Expression of DPP. 4 and GLP2R mRNA varied by developmental stage or lactational state in intestinal tissues. Expression of GCG or GLP2R mRNA was correlated with molecular markers of proliferation; apoptosis, blood flow, enzyme activity, and urea transport, depending on the tissue examined; which suggests a potential for involvement; of GLP-2 in these physiological processes in the ruminant GIT. The GUM. protein was expressed in intestinal crypts of the bovine GIT, which is consistent; with the distribution in monogastric species. Our findings support a. functional role of the GLP-2 pathway in bovine GIT and the potential for use of GLP-2 as a therapy to improve intestinal function and nutrient absorption in ruminants.									10	0	0	10	0	10			0022-0302			WOS:000283532700019	20965332

G., Jr.								Pigeon peas as a supplement for lactating dairy cows fed corn silage-based diets								JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE				93	11			5309	5317		10.3168/jds.2010-3182			NOV 2010	2010	Holstein rumen-cannulated cows [n = 7; initial body weight (BW) 640.56 +/- 71.43 kg] were fed a corn silage basal diet with 1 of 3 concentrates (C = control; P10 = 10% pigeon peas; P20 = 20% pigeon peas). Cows were randomly assigned to treatments in a replicated 3 x 3 Latin square and individually fed using Calan gates. Each experimental period was 21 d with 7 d for adaption and 14 d for sample collection. Ruminal fluid samples were taken the last day of each experimental period and analyzed for pH, ammonia, long-chain fatty acids, and volatile fatty acids (VFA). Consecutive a.m. and p.m, milk samples were taken during the last 2 wk of the 21-d period and analyzed for fat, protein, long-chain fatty acids, and somatic cell count. Dry matter intake (kg/d) was reduced during the second period and was greater for P10 diets. Milk protein was greater for cows fed P20 compared with P10. Energy-corrected milk was greater for cows fed the control diet compared with P10. Treatment had no effect on milk yield. Ruminal fluid pH decreased over sampling times; however, pH remained at or above 5.5. Diets did not affect ruminal fluid pH; however, pH was different for sampling periods. Ruminal ammonia decreased until 8 h postfeeding at which time it peaked consistent with changes in ammonia concentrations that usually peak 3 to 5 h postfeeding on diets high in plant proteins. Dietary treatments altered ruminal fluid VFA with reduced concentrations of acetate and greater concentrations of propionate for control diet, resulting in reduced acetate: propionate ratio. Isobutyrate exhibited an hour by treatment interaction, in which isobutyrate decreased until 8 h postfeeding and then tended to be greater for P10 than for other treatments. Animals fed the P10 diet had greater concentrations of ruminal isovalerate. Ruminal cis-9,trans-11 and trans-10,cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomers were not affected by dietary treatments. The 110 diet had greatest ruminal synthesis of cis-9, trans-11, but control cows had greatest ruminal synthesis of trans-10, cis-12. Milk CLA isomers were similar among treatments. Trends were observed for greater cis-9, trans-11 and trans-10, cis-12 for the P10 diet. Pigeon peas may be used as a protein supplement in dairy diets without affecting milk production, dry matter intake, or ruminal environment when they replace corn and soybean meal.									0	0	0	0	1	1			0022-0302			WOS:000283532700034	20965347

Contemporary approaches to carrying capacity rely on formulation, monitoring, and management of indicators and standards of quality. Recreational carrying capacity of Lake Umbagog National Wildlife Refuge, located in northern New Hampshire and Maine, was analyzed using visitor surveys that employed normative theory and methods and visual simulations of a range of recreation-related conditions. Study findings suggest that indicators of quality for the visitor experience include the number of boats seen on Lake Umbagog and associated rivers, the size of boating groups, the minimum acceptable chance of seeing selected types of wildlife, and the minimum acceptable chance of catching selected types of fish. Study findings also suggest a range of standards of quality for these indicators. Recreational carrying capacity of Lake Umbagog National Wildlife Refuge can be managed by using study findings to guide formulation of indicators and standards of quality, monitoring indicator variables, and taking management actions to ensure that standards of quality are maintained.									4	0	0	1	0	4			1944-687X			WOS:000208546600016		
J	Dong, Liang								Limits of Stimulated Brillouin Scattering Suppression in Optical Fibers With Transverse Acoustic Waveguide Designs								JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY				28	21			3156	3161		10.1109/JLT.2010.2078489			NOV 1 2010	2010	A major approach investigated recently for stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) suppression in fiber amplifiers for high power single frequency fiber lasers is to explore designs of acoustic waveguide in optical fibers. This acoustic waveguide can be implemented to some extent independent of the optical waveguide by using a combination of dopants which modify the host glass by varying levels in acoustic and optical properties. Although this approach provides some SBS suppressions, the new analysis described in this work, considering the often omitted leaky acoustic modes, demonstrates its limit. A complex acoustic mode solver, reported in details elsewhere, was recently developed to find solutions for simultaneous longitudinal and shear acoustic wave equations which satisfy rigorous boundary conditions in an arbitrary circular acoustic waveguide. By taking advantage of this new tool, it is possible to find the leaky acoustic modes for acoustic waveguides designed for SBS suppressions. In these acoustic waveguides, the guided acoustic modes often have a reduced overlap with the optical modes by design and, sometimes, do not exist at all, while the leaky acoustic mode can have a significant stronger overlap with the optical modes and, consequently, can play a dominant role in the SBS gain spectrum. It is, therefore, critical to consider the leaky acoustic modes in these cases. Two prominent transverse acoustic waveguide designs proposed recently for SBS suppression in optical fibers are studied here. This work reports, for the first time, the limits of these designs for SBS suppression. With consideration of the leakage acoustic modes, some new insights are provided on the underlying physics as well as on how to optimize these designs for optimal SBS suppression.									10	1	0	0	0	10			0733-8724			WOS:000283547800004		
J	Dong, Liang								Formulation of a Complex Mode Solver for Arbitrary Circular Acoustic Waveguides								JOURNAL OF LIGHTWAVE TECHNOLOGY				28	21			3162	3175		10.1109/JLT.2010.2078488			NOV 1 2010	2010	There has been a resurgence of interests in stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) in optical fibers recently. This is largely due to the need to overcome SBS for power scaling of single frequency fiber lasers. Complex acoustic waveguide designs have been proposed for SBS suppression in optical fibers. There is, therefore, a strong need for finding acoustic modes in complex acoustic waveguides. Furthermore, leaky acoustic modes are often ignored in recent works on SBS in optical fiber. Many leaky acoustic modes involved in SBS in optical fibers often have comparable losses to guided acoustic modes. The losses of both guided acoustic modes and many leaky acoustic modes are dominated by the extremely high material loss of acoustic waves in the GHz region in optical fibers. Therefore, it is very important to consider these leaky acoustic modes in SBS in optical fibers, especially for acoustic antiguide designs used for SBS suppressions, where those leaky acoustic modes are often responsible for the peak SBS gain and consequently SBS threshold. Even for optical fibers with guided acoustic waveguide, fine features in SBS gain spectra can be better understood by studying the additional contributions from leaky acoustic modes. In this work, we report, for the first time, a complex vector acoustic mode solver capable of finding both guided and leaky acoustic modes in arbitrary circular acoustic waveguides. The validity of the mode solver is verified by comparing simulated SBS gain spectra in two optical fibers, one with acoustic guide and one with acoustic antiguide, to measured ones. This acoustic mode solver can be used to provide highly accurate SBS gain spectrum in optical fibers. It will be a critical tool in optical fiber designs for SBS suppressions and enhancements. It will also be very important tool for understanding fine spectral details of SBS in optical fibers.									8	0	0	0	0	8			0733-8724			WOS:000284093100001

Multidisciplinary Design Optimization for Glass-Fiber Epoxy-Matrix Composite 5 MW Horizontal-Axis Wind-Turbine Blades								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE				19	8			1116	1127		10.1007/s11665-010-9596-2			NOV 2010	2010	A multi-disciplinary design-optimization procedure has been introduced and used for the development of cost-effective glass-fiber reinforced epoxy-matrix composite 5 MW horizontal-axis wind-turbine (HAWT) blades. The turbine-blade cost-effectiveness has been defined using the cost of energy (CoE), i.e., a ratio of the three-blade HAWT rotor development/fabrication cost and the associated annual energy production. To assess the annual energy production as a function of the blade design and operating conditions, an aerodynamics-based computational analysis had to be employed. As far as the turbine blade cost is concerned, it is assessed for a given aerodynamic design by separately computing the blade mass and the associated blade-mass/size-dependent production cost. For each aerodynamic design analyzed, a structural finite element-based and a post-processing life-cycle assessment analyses were employed in order to determine a minimal blade mass which ensures that the functional requirements pertaining to the quasi-static strength of the blade, fatigue-controlled blade durability and blade stiffness are satisfied. To determine the turbine-blade production cost (for the currently prevailing fabrication process, the wet lay-up) available data regarding the industry manufacturing experience were combined with the attendant blade mass, surface area, and the duration of the assumed production run. The work clearly revealed the challenges associated with simultaneously satisfying the strength, durability and stiffness requirements while maintaining a high level of wind-energy capture efficiency and a lower production cost.									28	4	0	0	0	31			1059-9495			WOS:000283307900004

A wealth of evidence for use in case studies exists in the form of undergraduate senior design courses, which produce documentation related to the design of new artifacts every academic semester. The resulting documentation can be effectively mined to test hypotheses about design processes and designer behaviors. In this paper, we offer an example application of how to apply case study research to a completed senior design project in order to test a theory for how designers, users, and artifacts behave as a complex adaptive system. The evidence from the case study supports the descriptive power of the theoretical framework and supports the practical conclusion that effective communication between designers and users is particularly important and should be strengthened to foster overall project success, especially during the problem definition stage of design.

J	Reneke, James A.; Wiecek, Margaret M.; Fadel, Georges M.; Samson, Sundeep; Nowak, Dimitri								Design Under Uncertainty: Balancing Expected Performance and Risk								JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN				132	11					111009	10.1115/1.4002836			NOV 2010	2010	The problem of quantifying uncertainty in the design process is approached indirectly. Nonquantifiable variability resulting from lack of knowledge is treated as epistemic uncertainty and quantifiable variability caused by random influences is treated as aleatory uncertainty. The emphasis in this approach is on the effects of epistemic uncertainty, left unquantified, on design performance. Performance is treated as a random function of the epistemic uncertainties that are considered as independent variables, and a design decision is based on the mean and variance of design performance. Since the mean and variance are functions of the uncertainties, multicriteria decision methods are employed to determine the preferred design. The methodology is illustrated on a three-spring model with stochastic forcing and two uncertain damping coefficients. Based on the example, the concept of balancing expected performance and risk is explored in an engineering context. Risk is quantified using aleatory uncertainty for fixed values of epistemic uncertainty. The study shows the unique features of this approach in which risk-based design decisions are made under both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties without assuming a distribution for epistemic uncertainty.

Under the assumptions that (A) 0 < tr Sigma(i)/p < infinity as p -> infinity for i = 1,..., 16 and (B) p/n -> c < infinity known as the concentration, a new statistic is developed utilizing the ratio of the fourth and second arithmetic means of the eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix. The newly defined test has many desirable general asymptotic properties, such as normality and consistency when (n, p) -> infinity. Our simulation results show that the new test is comparable to, and in some cases more powerful than, the tests for sphericity in the current literature. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

However, the conditions used were very different from typical fuel cell conditions. Recent research has shown the impact of conductivity measurement conditions on NH4+ contaminated membranes. In this study, the impact of nonproton-containing cations (Mn+ = Na+,Ca2+, and Fe3+) on Nation membrane (N-211) conductivity was investigated both in deionized (DI) water at room temperature (similar to 25 degrees C) and in the gas phase at 80 degrees C under conditions similar to in a PEMFC. These conductivities were compared with those of Nation membranes contaminated with NH4+ ions. Under the same conditions, the conductivity of a metal cationic-contaminated membrane having the same proton composition (y(H+m)) was similar, but slightly lower than that of an NH4+-contaminated membrane. The conductivity in the purely H+-form of N-211 was more than 12 times greater than the Mn+-form form at 25 C in DI water. At 80 C. the gas-phase conductivity was 6 times and 125 times greater at 100%RH and 30%RH. respectively. The quantitative results for conductivity and activation energy of contaminated membranes under typical fuel cell conditions are reported here for the first time. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Although SEC is a proven method of separation based on hydrodynamic size, a chromatographic method based solely on chemical interactions would present certain advantages. This laboratory has been investigating the use of capillary-channeled polymer (C-CP) fibers as stationary phases in HPLC for the separation of biomacromolecules. C-CP fibers allow highly efficient fluid transport and an amorphous surface structure, minimizing mass transfer effects commonly associated with porous, packed-bed technologies. Choice of the base fiber identity allows flexibility in the potential types of solute surface interactions. Two water-soluble polymers, glycolic acid ethoxylate 4-nonylphenyl ether, and poly(4-vinylpyridine hydrochloride), were used as test solutes because of their similarities to polymers of interest in the consumer products industry. SEC separation of this pair was not possible due to the similarities in hydrodynamic size. Poly(ethylene terephthalate), polyester and nylon-6 C-CP fibers were evaluated as stationary phase materials. The former was found to offer superior chromatographic separations and recoveries when operating under what would be considered to be typical RP separation conditions: a flow rate of 1 mL/min and gradient of 0-100% H(2)O/ACN with 0.06% TFA over 5 mm.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1615-9306			WOS:000285164800014	20972973

The traditional problems of inhomogeneity, non-stoichiometry, crystal striations and crystal cracking resulting from phase transitions associated with this family compounds are minimized by the hydrothermal crystal growth technique. Crystals of good optical quality with only minor amounts of metal ion reduction can be grown this way. Reactions were also designed to provide homogeneous distribution of tantalum and niobium metal centers throughout the KTN crystal lattice to maximize its electro-optic properties. Synthesis was performed at relatively low (500-660 degrees C) temperatures in comparison to the flux and Czochralski techniques. This work represents the largest crystals of this family of compounds grown by hydrothermal methods to date. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Evaluation of Statistical Validity of Some Asphalt Binder Grade Systems								JOURNAL OF TESTING AND EVALUATION				38	6			667	673		10.1520/JTE102389			NOV 2010	2010	The performance grade (PG) and the penetration (pen) grade systems were examined for their statistical validity. It is found from this limited study that the pass/fail high-temperature of the PG binder follows a normal distribution. Since PG system has no gap between each grade, the binder falling out of limit trespasses into another binder grade. The Korean pen grading system has the same problem. Therefore, many products can have similar property levels with an adjacent-grade even though the mean value is within the specification limit. The PG binder will have a high chance of passing the rheological requirements at above the upper limit but the least chance of falling below the lower limit because the means were above median and variations were higher than they should be. Since PG is characterized without gap between each grade, the producer must maintain the coefficient of variation below the current level to satisfy the quality control limit of the product. Similarly, in other grading systems such as the Korean pen specifications, due to its lack of a gap between grades, higher percentage of products will be duplicated even if the mean is at the median of the specification limits due to material's quality uncertainty. Especially if the mean moves toward the upper limit, one-half of the binder grade will be overlapped with the higher binder grade. Therefore, these specifications should be statistically examined for further modification.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0090-3973	1945-7553		WOS:000285234800004

Plasmon enhanced direct and inverse Faraday effects in non-magnetic nanocomposites								JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA B-OPTICAL PHYSICS				27	11			2165	2173					NOV 2010	2010	While applications of plasmonics are rapidly growing, magneto-optical effects in nanocomposites are poorly understood. We therefore devote this paper to the theoretical analysis of magneto-optical effects in nanocomposites. Based on the Drude model, we derived the constitutive equation where the dielectric and coupling functions describe the interactions of metal nanoparticles with magnetic field. In the limitation of low volume fraction of metal nanoparticles (i.e., when the material is still transparent), these functions were calculated within the Maxwell-Rayleigh theory of dilute suspensions. We showed that in the absence of external magnetic fields, a non-magnetic nanoparticle can be magnetized in the circularly polarized light beam, and the magnetization depends on the direction of rotation of the light wave. The external magnetic field alters the particle magnetization, and when the fields are weak, this change in magnetization linearly depends on the particular field. The proposed theory was applied to an analysis of the Faraday effect in nanocomposites. We predicted a resonance behavior of the Verdet function in nanocomposites and its dependence on concentration, sample thickness, and external magnetic field.

Residents as Travel Destination Information Providers: An Online Community Perspective								JOURNAL OF TRAVEL RESEARCH				49	4			400	413		10.1177/0047287509346856			NOV 2010	2010	Prior research regarding residents and tourists has focused on their commonalities and interactions occurring on-site. What is missing from the literature is an examination of residents as information sources to potential tourists. Online travel communities offer such a viable venue. This study has two main purposes. The first is to examine the influence residents may have on travel decisions and identify the types of travel decisions they influence. The second is to compare the influence residents have on travel decisions with other online community members (i.e., experienced travelers). Treemapper is used to identify the country forums, and thematic networks are used for the analysis of influence of eWOM. The results reveal that nearly one-third of the communication threads (including 1,699 postings from 713 contributing members) have been influential for members. Residents are more influential in accommodations and food and beverage recommendations, whereas experienced travelers are more influential in the destination information category.									18	1	0	1	0	19			0047-2875	1552-6763		WOS:000285244000002

The domesticated species Oryza sativa or Asian rice is one of the key domesticated crop species in the world. The island of Madagascar off the coast of East Africa was one of the last major Old World areas of introduction of rice after the domestication of this crop species and before extensive historical global trade in this crop. Asian rice was introduced in Madagascar from India, the Malay Peninsula and Indonesia approximately 800-1400 years ago. Studies of domestication traits characteristic of the two independently domesticated Asian rice subspecies, indica and tropical japonica, suggest two major waves of migrations into Madagascar. A population genetic analysis of rice in Madagascar using sequence data from 53 gene fragments provided insights into the dynamics of island founder events during the expansion of a crop species' geographic range and introduction to novel agro-ecological environments. We observed a significant decrease in genetic diversity in rice from Madagascar when compared to those in Asia, likely the result of a bottleneck on the island. We also found a high frequency of a unique indica type in Madagascar that shows clear population differentiation from most of the sampled Asian landraces, as well as differential exchange of alleles between Asia and Madagascar populations of the tropical japonica subspecies. Finally, despite partial reproductive isolation between japonica and indica, there was evidence of indica/japonica recombination resulting from their hybridization on the island.									8	0	0	6	0	8			0962-1083			WOS:000283986700007	20964753
