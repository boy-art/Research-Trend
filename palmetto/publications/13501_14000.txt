No host-plant information has been available. It is newly recorded from Arizona (Luna Lake, Apache County) and from an additional site in Mineral County, Colorado (SW of South Fork). At both sites, nymphs and adults were common on woolly cinquefoil (Potentilla hippiana Lehm.; Rosaceae). A diagnosis and photographs of the adult habitus are included to facilitate recognition of this obscure tingid in the fauna of western North America.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0013-8797			WOS:000263117900025

S	Murphy, Michael A.; Fenn, Michael; Goasguen, Sebastien						ElBaz, D; Spies, F; Gross, T		Virtual Organization Clusters								PROCEEDINGS OF THE PARALLEL, DISTRIBUTED AND NETWORK-BASED PROCESSING		Euromicro Conference on Parallel Distributed and Network-Based Processing						401	408		10.1109/.22			2009	2009	Sharing traditional clusters based on multiprogramming systems among different Virtual Organizations (VOs) can lead to complex situations resulting from the differing software requirements of each VO. This complexity could be eliminated if each cluster computing system supported only a single VO, thereby permitting the VO to customize the operating system and software selection available on its private cluster While dedicating entire physical clusters on the Grid to single VOs is not practical in terms of cost and scale, an equivalent separation of VOs may be accomplished by deploying clusters of Virtual Machines (VMs) in a manner that gives each VO its own virtual cluster Such Virtual Organization Clusters (VOCs) can have numerous benefits, including isolation of VOs from one another independence of each VOC from the underlying hardware, allocation of physical resources on a per-VO basis, and clear separation of administrative responsibilities between the physical fabric provider and the VO itself.Initial results of implementing a complete system utilizing the proposed Virtual Organization Cluster Model confirm the administrative simplicity of isolating VO software from the physical system. End-user computational jobs submitted through the Grid are executed only on the virtual cluster supporting the respective VO, and each VO has substantial administrative flexibility in terms of software choice and system configuration. Performance tests using the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor indicated a virtualization overhead of under 10% for latency-tolerant scientific applications, such as those that would be submitted to a standard or vanilla Condor universe. Latency-sensitive applications, such as MPI, experience substantial performance degradation with virtualization overheads on the order of 60%. These results suggest that VOCs are suitable for High-Throughput Computing (HTC) applications, where real-time network performance is not critical. VOCs might also be useful for High-Performance Computing (HPC) applications if virtual network performance can be sufficiently improved.					17th Euromicro International Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Network-Based Processing17th Euromicro International Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Network-Based Processing	FEB 18-20, 2009FEB 18-20, 2009		Bauhaus Univ Weimar, Weimar, GERMANYBauhaus Univ Weimar, Weimar, GERMANY	1	0	0	0	0	1			1066-6192		978-0-7695-3544-9	WOS:000267706900052

It brings together scholars from diverse schools working on new areas of research and application in urban design and planning. Emergent research agendas include both novel areas of research and important shifts in the direction of a research area. The challenge for planning schools is to reflect critically on these changes and develop long-term research agendas that can better position our field in society and academia, and provide a basis from which to assess our academic programmes. The chapters in this issue display the different scales and fields of planning, including planning for: disaster recovery; climate change, especially opportunities for mitigation; shrinking cities in the First World; and rapidly urbanising informal and impoverished cities in the global South. At the same time, the chapters identify research areas that respond to major social and environmental changes. Olshansky and Chang highlight the increasing losses from catastrophic disasters, and address the need for disaster recovery planning. Wheeler, Randolph and London focus on climate change, and, noting the urgency of action now, their research agenda emphasises opportunities for planners to develop research and policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Hollander, Pallagst, Schwarz and Popper look at increasing economic and population trends in many First World cities that result in city 'shrinkage'. They present new opportunities for improving cities' green space networks and natural features, and for research. The trebling of urban population in African cities by 2050, in conditions of poverty and informality, is the major trend driving Parnell, Pietriese and Watson's chapter. They present an agenda for new planning theories and for supporting empirical research to address the actual conditions of African cities. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

It brings together scholars from diverse schools working on new areas of research and application in urban design and planning. Emergent research agendas include both novel areas of research and important shifts in the direction of a research area. The challenge for planning schools is to reflect critically on these changes and develop long-term research agendas that can better position our field in society and academia, and provide a basis from which to assess our academic programmes. The chapters presented in this issue reinforce key aspects of planning: multi-scale, and multi-faceted, yet integrative in its intent, stressing the physical, yet inescapably social. At the same time, they identify research areas that respond to major social and environmental changes. Blanco and Alberti focus on the latest findings in climate change science and on planning for adaptation; they highlight the opportunities that planners have to provide leadership in this area. Forsyth, Krizek and Rodriguez take up the issue of non-motorised travel, a topic of increasing interest for urban designers, public health experts and transportation and energy planners. For Talen and Ellis, an emerging challenge is the need to plan for diverse and compact communities.

The effects of 28 hours of sleep deprivation on respiratory sinus arrhythmia during tasks with low and high controlled attention demands								PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY				46	1			217	224		10.1111/j.1469-8986.2008.00718.x			JAN 2009	2009	Task performance while sleep deprived may be moderated by the controlled attention required by the task (Pilcher, Band, Odle-Dusseau, & Muth, 2007). This study examined the effects of 28 h of sleep deprivation on respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) during tasks with low and high controlled attention demands. The results showed that RSA increased throughout the night for both task types, but was consistently reduced during the low compared to high controlled attention tasks. The increase in RSA was linear for the high controlled attention tasks but curvilinear for the low ones. Hence, RSA followed a circadian pattern during the low controlled attention tasks but not the high ones. These results suggest that the effects of sleep deprivation on task performance may be moderated by parasympathetic activity and task type, and this has implications for task assignment during sustained operations that cause sleep deprivation.									15	1	0	10	0	16			0048-5772			WOS:000261983300024	18823412

It has been demonstrated that the width of single-mode semiconductor laser can be increased by at least two orders of magnitude using the transverse Bragg reflection of two dimensional periodic nanostructures. In this talk, we will describe a photonic crystal structure to obtain the single mode operation of large-area, edge-emitting semiconductor lasers. Pulsed and CW operation of electrically pumped, single-mode photonic crystal broad area lasers (100 mu m wide and 550 mu m long) with single-lobe, diffraction-limited far-fields are experimentally demonstrated at room temperature. A wavelength tuning sensitivity 80 times smaller than a conventional DFB laser is also achieved for the photonic crystal Bragg laser.

S	Kumar, V. S. Anil; Macauley, Matt; Mortveit, Henning S.						Bournez, O; Potapov, I		Limit Set Reachability in Asynchronous Graph Dynamical Systems								REACHABILITY PROBLEMS, PROCEEDINGS		Lecture Notes in Computer Science		5797				217	+					2009	2009	Using the framework of sequential dynamical systems (SDSs), a class of asynchronous graph dynamical systems, we show flow the notions of reachability and stability can be negatively correlated. Specifically, we show that certain threshold SDSs exhibit update sequence instability: Over certain graph classes, there exist initial configurations from where exponentially many fixed points are reachable under different update sequences, i.e., the omega-limit set has size Theta(2(vertical bar V vertical bar)). We establish this first for treewidth bounded graphs and then for random graphs in the G(n,p) model of Erdos-Renyi for a large range of p. We also show that this update sequence instability is not present in dense graphs, suggesting that sparsity and tree-like structure plays an important role in the stability of the system. These dynamical systems arise in applications such as functional gene annotation, where threshold SDSs are employed to predict gene functions through a fixed point computation, based on an initial state (prediction) and a nongeneric choice of update sequence. The results in this paper should be viewed as cautionary advice in the construction and application of such algorithms. This paper also provides a starting point for a study of update sequence stochastic SDSs.					3rd International Workshop on Reachability Problems3rd International Workshop on Reachability Problems	SEP 23-25, 2009SEP 23-25, 2009		Ecol Polytech, Palaiseau, FRANCEEcol Polytech, Palaiseau, FRANCE	0	0	0	0	0	0			0302-9743		978-3-642-04419-9	WOS:000272107500020

The negative correlation does not merely reflect the tendency of larger families to locate within less-expensive areas of a given metropolitan area. Our study focuses on younger households, but analysis of completed fertility among older households reinforces the findings for younger households. Estimates for 36 CMSAs using the American Housing Survey, which permit us to construct persquare-foot measures of the price of living space. indicate that our findings are not merely an artifact of larger families occupying houses with more rooms. Durbin-Wu-Hausman tests reveal little evidence of endogeneity bias. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									17	0	0	0	0	17			0166-0462			WOS:000262540600004

The inspected target is an automotive polyethylene, optically black fender, with average roughness of 1 Am, while the sought features are mold sinks with depth variations of 0.3-1.0 mm and a width of - 3 mm,Design/methodology/approach - Several non-contact scanning and reconstruction optical modalities are discussed along with its associated noise for current application; such techniques include interferometry and triangulation. The proposed system projects a linear coherent illumination and scans its reflection profile to infer the reflected component position using trigonometry and its width using a Sobel morphological operator. The retrieved dimensions are then reconstructed into feature boundaries that enable a depth and width quantification.Findings - The proposed setup and processing are validated through experimental scans of actual molded fenders with artificial deviations. The proposed system accuracy is then analyzed and its spatial resolution is found to be 0.14 mm using the current charge-coupled device format of 640 x 480. Additionally the proposed system is benchmarked against a commercial 3D stereo-based scanner; proposed system proved to be more accurate with faster scanning rates.Research limitations/implications - The post processor combines the predicted width and depth values in real-time to synthesize a 3D surface profile for sought features, with a resolution of 0.14 mm, an accuracy of 0.09 mm, and a repeatability of 0.11 mm. The proposed scheme is customized to current laser illuminant and to the plastic surface profile, which further modifications for other illuminations and roughness values.Originality/value - New image processing code is used to reduce the laser speckle effect and the moving mechanism vibration using a moving Gaussian illuminant and a double thresholding scheme coupled with sequential averaging, respectively.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0260-2288			WOS:000268036300007

The results from Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed the successful grafting of both polymers from the membrane surfaces. Contact angle measurements were done to illustrate the temperature responsive wettability of the modified membrane surfaces. Modified membranes were used in flux measurements of wastewater produced during coal bed methane gas exploration. The degree of fouling of the original and the modified membranes was examined by pure water flux recovery measurements after produced water filtration and a temperature-controlled water rinse.

A three degree of freedom (3 DOF) nanomanipulator with revolute revolute prismatic (RRP) actuator structure, named here MM3A (R), can be utilized for a variety of nanomanipulation tasks. Previous publications of the authors present the mathematical modeling and robust control of manipulator's tip using fused visual servoing and force sensor feedbacks.Due to lack of position and velocity feedbacks in MM3A (R) nanomanipulator, a fused vision/force feedback robust controller has been recently designed by the authors. Previous publications of the authors present the optimal utilization of the visual servoing and force sensor feedbacks for use in the nanomanipulation tasks. More specifically, the visual servoing and force feedback structures are investigated through extensive simulations in order to reveal issues in practical implementation.In modeling the force sensing module of the designed fused feedback controller, previous publications of the authors present a closed-form distributed-parameters based modeling framework for piezoresistive Nanomechanical Cantilever (NMC)-based force sensors used in a variety of cantilever-based nanomanipulation actions. Current modeling practices call for a simple lumped-parameters framework rather than modeling the piezoresistive NMC itself. Due to the widespread applications of such NMCs in nanoscale force sensing or non-contact atomic force microscopy with nano-Newton to pico-Newton force measurement requirements, precise modeling of the piezoresistive microcantilevers is essential. Instead of the previously used lumped-parameters modeling, a distributed-parameters modeling framework is proposed and developed in previous publications of the authors to arrive at the most complete model of the piezoresistive NMC including tip-mass, tip-force and base movement considerations.Here, experimental results are presented to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed distributed-parameters model when compared with the previously reported lumped-parameters modeling approach. It is shown that by utilizing the distributed-parameters model rather than lumped-parameters approach and by predicting the exact motion of each point on the NMC, the precision of the piezoresistive NMC's model is significantly enhanced. Such novel modeling framework could pave the pathway towards nanomechanical cantilever-based manipulation and positioning as detailed in the second part.

Apparently, the most important property of these devices is their precision and durability. The more they have accuracy, the more delicate tasks may be performed. Hence, the design of an accurate model for achieving this objective is a challenging problem that has attracted the attention of many recent researchers in the nanotechnology field. In this paper, the kinematics and dynamics as well as development of appropriate controllers for a RRP (revolute-revolute-prismatic) nanomanipulator are presented. The specific task considered here for this manipulator is for the tip to track a predefined trajectory.

Interactional Theory and the Sustainable Nature-Based Tourism Experience								SOCIETY & NATURAL RESOURCES				22	8			761	776		10.1080/08941920802017560			2009	2009	Two complementary studies were conducted to investigate both the immediate and long-term influence of Grand Canyon National Park multi-day commercial whitewater rafting experiences on participants' knowledge of the host protected area, attitudes toward management issues facing the host protected area, and environmental behaviors and future intentions. Through the use of multiple regression models, this investigation also explored the influence of tour and tourist characteristics on these outcomes to test and refine an interactional model. Results suggest that nature-based tourism operators can be efficacious partners for resource managers in providing experiences that educate the public to the importance of protected areas. In addition, the interactional model provided a useful framework for investigating the influence of tourist and tour characteristics on experiential outcomes and ultimately the sustainability of protected areas.									12	0	0	2	0	12			0894-1920			WOS:000269128600005

Partial Disturbance of Resources Foraged by Reticulitermes flavipes								SOCIOBIOLOGY				54	3			973	989					2009	2009	The introduction of termiticidal baits over 10 years ago has increased interest in the basic foraging behavior of pest termite species. Due to the amount of interference with foraged Cellulose material (bait matrices, both treated and untreated) in bait stations as part of some control programs,the following study was initiated to examine the response of termites to very short term (1 wk) partial disturbances of a foraged resource. Does weekly Interruption (disturbance) of 0, 25, 50, 75, or 100% of a foraged resource reduce feeding (or activity) by Subterranean termites? Four pre-weighed cubes of southern yellow pine (Pinus spp. L.) in close proximity (I cm) were provided to groups of Eastern Subterranean termites [Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar)] as foraging choices in two different screw-top Jar arena tests. Tie first study was done in single jars requiring termites to stay confined near the disturbed blocks,while a second study used three connected jars providing the termites with the ability to avoid the Jar with the disturbed blocks altogether. Both studies used similar methods, differing only in arena design. In these studies, one, two, three, all or none of the blocks were picked LIP carefully and the number of termites on the moved block Counted weekly. Data from both studies indicated that termites did not permanently leave disturbed blocks, and that between 50 and 75% of the blocks needed to be moved to reduce feeding on the disturbed blocks.									2	0	0	2	0	2			0361-6525			WOS:000271544900025		
J	Mulrooney, J. E.; Gerard, P. D.								Tunneling and Activity of Reticulitermes flavipes (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae) Exposed to Low Concentrations of Nonrepellent Termiticides								SOCIOBIOLOGY				53	3			695	706					2009	2009	Tunneling and activity bioassays of chlorfenapyr, fipronil, and imidacloprid treated sand were conducted in the laboratory using Reticulitermes flavipes (Kollar). Termites tunneled significantly less through sand treated with 1.0 ppm concentrations of fipronil and imidacloprid compared to the control and chlorfenapyr. Mortality after 7 d was 57, 25, and 29% for fipronil, chlorfenapyr, and imidacloprid, respectively. In a second experiment, termite activity was determined from sound events detected in an acoustical event detection system over a 48 h period after termites were placed on sand treated with 1.0 or 10.0 ppm concentrations. Activity of termites declined to near zero within 3 and 9 h when exposed to 1.0 ppm imidacloprid- and fipronil-treated sand, respectively. Termites in the 1.0 ppm chlorfenapyr treatment showed a decline in activity to near zero after 7 h, followed by an increase in activity and another decline at 12 and 13 h only to increase once again and remain significantly above zero for the remainder of the 48 h period. Mean termite mortality 7 d after termites were placed on treated sand was 100, 99, and 76% for fipronil, chlorfenapyr, and imidacloprid, respectively. Termite activity declined to near zero 2, 8, and 9 h after exposure to 10.0 ppm imidacloprid-, chlorfenapyr-, and fipronil-treated sand, respectively. Mortality associated with the 10.0 ppm concentration, recorded after 4 d, was 100% for fipronil and 92% for chlorfenapyr. Mortality due to imidacloprid exposure was 100% after 7 d.									4	1	0	3	0	5			0361-6525			WOS:000270860800007		
J	Alonzo, Jose; Mays, Jimmy W.; Kilbey, S. Michael, II								Forces of interaction between surfaces bearing looped polymer brushes in good solvent								SOFT MATTER				5	9			1897	1904		10.1039/b812534a			2009	2009	In a previous publication we suggested [Huang et al., Macromolecules, 2008, 41, 1745-1752] that looped polymer brushes formed by tethering chains by both ends to a surface may exhibit a polydispersity-like effect due to a distribution of distances between tethering points, leading to segment density profiles dominated by a long and diffuse exponentially-decaying tail. To study this issue in more detail, the force profiles (forces of interaction as a function of separation distance) of a series of looped polymer brushes made by preferential adsorption of poly(2-vinylpyridine)-polystyrene-poly(2-vinylpyridine) (PVP-b-PS-b-PVP) triblock copolymers of varying molecular weight and asymmetry ratio are measured using the surface forces apparatus. The force profiles are analyzed using an equivalent diblock model, which considers the triblock copolymer brushes as being comprised of two diblock copolymers of half the PS molecular weight. While scaling the dependencies of the interaction energy and distance on molecular weight, the tethering density and segment size coalesce the measured force profiles to the "universal profile'', it is necessary to include polydispersity in the description of the equilibrium structure. This is done using the self-consistent field model of Milner et al. [Macromolecules, 1988, 21, 2610-2619]. For looped brushes formed from the symmetric and moderately symmetric triblock copolymers we find that the polydispersity due to molecular weight distribution effectively accounts for the observed force profiles. On the other hand, agreement between the measured and predicted force profiles of looped brushes formed from highly asymmetric copolymers at low degrees-of-compression is achieved only if a much smaller value of the polydispersity index is used in the fitting. The implication of these results is that the shape of the segment density profiles is not due to the previously proposed anchor-induced polydispersity arising due to loop formation; however in the case of highly asymmetric copolymers, loop formation may constrain the stretching of the chains relative to what is expected for brushes formed from the equivalent diblock copolymer.									12	0	0	2	0	12			1744-683X			WOS:000265413500019

The resulting hydrologic and stratigraphic columns show a generalized relation between hydrologic and geologic units. Fresh-water aquifers encountered are the surficial, Yorktown, Pungo River and Castle Hayne. Geologic units present are of the middle and upper Tertiary and Quaternary periods, these are the Castle Hayne (Eocene), Pungo River (Miocene), Yorktown (Pliocene), James City and Flanner Beach (Pleistocene), and the topsoil (Holocene). The River Bend Formation (Oligocene) is missing as a distinct unit between the Pungo River Formation and the Castle Hayne Formation. The confining unit underlying the Yorktown Aquifer corresponds to the Yorktown Geologic Unit. The remaining hydrologic units and geologic units are hydrologically transitional and non-coincident. The lower Pungo River Formation serves as the confining unit for the Castle Hayne Aquifer, rather than the River Bend Aquifer, and separates the Pungo River Aquifer from the upper Castle Hayne Aquifer. All geologic formations were bound by unconformitics. All aquifers were confined by the anticipated hydrologic units. We conclude that CR-622 (Strat 8) represents a normal sequence in the Atlantic Coastal Plain.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1547-139X			WOS:000265545500006

Only those students who used alcohol and completed both baseline and 3-month follow-up surveys were included in the analyses (n = 347). Mixed-model multivariate analyses indicated that higher sexuality and tension reduction expectancies were prospectively related to more alcohol consumption-related negative consequences for males but not for females. Findings suggest that intervention efforts to prevent problem drinking would benefit from being gender-specific. The study's limitations are noted.									13	0	0	5	1	13			1082-6084			WOS:000268237800003	19938937

First, I will analyze the composition of Bengali revolutionary organizations. Although Bengali revolutionary terrorism was not a mass movement, I argue that there was greater diversity in the movement's social and religious composition, and in the outlook of its members, than is often assumed. Second, I will examine the question of indigenous versus foreign influences on Indian terrorism. Terrorism in Bengal and elsewhere in colonial India was diverse in its inspirations, drawing upon indigenous resistance to colonial rule, and Hindu religious imagery, as well as European anarchist, nationalist, and socialist movements. Lastly, I will consider some of the ways in which the revolutionary movement changed over its thirty-year history and conclude with a brief discussion of the colonial response to Bengali terrorism. Bengali terrorists' adaptation and re-fashioning of ideas and tactics in a colonial context illustrate the widespread networks of exchange within the British Empire.

The ABNF journal : official journal of the Association of Black Nursing Faculty in Higher Education, Inc				20	1			5	11					2009	2009	A descriptive cross-sectional study was designed to examine the influence of family resources and coping behaviors on the well-being of African American and Caucasian parents providing care to a school-age child with asthma. A convenience sample of 71 (33 African American and 38 Caucasian) parents of school-age children with asthma were recruited from two private medical practices and one school. Family resources were assessed using the Family Inventory of Resources for Management. Coping behaviors were assessed using the Coping Health Inventory for Parents and well-being was measured by the General Well-being Schedule. For both groups, the findings revealed family resources are significantly related to parental well-being. Also, coping behaviors were significantly related to the well-being of Caucasian parents. The results of this study support the literature related to the importance of resiliency factors such as family resources and coping behaviors on parental well-being.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1046-7041			MEDLINE:19278181	19278181	
J	Kothapalli, Chandrasekhar R.; Ramamurthi, Anand								Biomimetic Regeneration of Elastin Matrices Using Hyaluronan and Copper Ion Cues								TISSUE ENGINEERING PART A				15	1			103	113		10.1089/ten.tea.2007.0390			JAN 2009	2009	Current efforts to tissue engineer elastin-rich vascular constructs and grafts are limited because of the poor elastogenesis of adult vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and the unavailability of appropriate cues to upregulate and enhance cross-linking of elastin precursors (tropoelastin) into organized, mature elastin fibers. We earlier showed that hyaluronan (HA) fragments greatly enhance tropo- and matrix-elastin synthesis by SMCs, although the yield of matrix elastin is low. To improve matrix yields, here we investigate the benefits of adding copper (Cu(2+)) ions (0.01 M and 0.1 M), concurrent with HA (756-2000 kDa), to enhance lysyl oxidase (LOX)-mediated elastin cross-linking machinery. Although absolute elastin amounts in test groups were not different from those in controls, on a per-cell basis, 0.1 M of Cu(2+) ions slowed cell proliferation (5.6 +/- 2.3-fold increase over 21 days vs 22.9 +/- 4.2-fold for non-additive controls), stimulated synthesis of collagen (4.1 +/- 0.4-fold), tropo-elastin (4.1 +/- 0.05-fold) and cross-linked matrix elastin (4.2 +/- 0.7-fold). LOX protein synthesis increased 2.5 times in the presence of 0.1 M of Cu(2+) ions, and these trends were maintained even in the presence of HA fragments, although LOX functional activity remained unchanged in all cases. The abundance of elastin and LOX in cell layers cultured with 0.1 M of Cu(2+) ions and HA fragments was qualitatively confirmed using immunoflourescence. Scanning electron microscopy images showed that SMC cultures supplemented with 0.1 M of Cu(2+) ions and HA oligomers and large fragments exhibited better deposition of mature elastic fibers (similar to 1 mu m diameter). However, 0.01 M of Cu(2+) ions did not have any beneficial effect on elastin regeneration. In conclusion, the results suggest that supplying 0.1 M of Cu(2+) ions to SMCs to concurrently (a) enhance per-cell yield of elastin matrix while allowing cells to remain viable and synthetic and not density-arrested in long-term culture because of their moderating effects on otherwise rapid cell proliferation and (b) provide additional benefits of enhanced elastin fiber formation and cross-linking within these tissue-engineered constructs.									12	0	0	9	0	12			1937-3341			WOS:000262156700011	18847363

The ternary compound CdIn(2)S(4), now having the perfect normal (instead of partly inversed) spinel crystal lattice, as well as GaP with evenly distributed impurities demonstrate new stable and bright luminescent phenomena, including stimulated emission and "hot" luminescence at room temperature. All chosen semiconductor crystals from different groups of semiconductor compounds demonstrate the long-term ordering and improvement of useful for application properties.Existing technologies help us to reproduce artificially these naturally ordered structures for application in optoelectronics.					138th TMS Annual Meeting and Exhibition138th TMS Annual Meeting and Exhibition	FEB 15-19, 2009FEB 15-19, 2009		San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA	2	0	0	0	0	2					978-0-87339-740-7	WOS:000264675200059		
J	Baldwin, William S.; Roling, Jonathan A.								A Concentration Addition Model for the Activation of the Constitutive Androstane Receptor by Xenobiotic Mixtures								TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES				107	1			93	105		10.1093/toxsci/kfn206			JAN 2009	2009	The effects of contaminants are typically studied in individual exposures; however, environmental exposures are rarely from a single contaminant. Therefore, the study of chemical mixtures is important in determining the effects of xenobiotics. The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) responds to endobiotics and xenobiotics, and in turn induces detoxification enzymes involved in their elimination. First, we compared several androgens as inverse agonists, including androgens allegedly used by Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative to enhance athletic performance. CAR inverse agonists ranked in order of potency were dihydroandrosterone (DHA) > tetrahydrogestrinone (THG) > androstanol > norbolethone. Therefore, we used DHA as an inverse agonist during transactivation assays. Next, we examined the effects of several pesticides, plasticizers, steroids, and bile acids on CAR activation. Our data demonstrates that several pesticides and plasticizers, including diethylhexylphthalate, nonylphenol, cypermethrin, and chlorpyrifos activate CAR. Both full and partial CAR activators were discovered, and EC(50) values and Hillslopes were determined for use in the concentration addition models. Concentration addition models with and without restraint values to account for partial activators were developed. Measured results from transactivation assays with a mixture of two to five chemicals indicate that the concentration addition model without restraints correctly predicts activity unless all of the chemicals in the mixture are partial activators, and then restraint values be considered. Overall, our data indicates that it is important to consider that we are exposed to a milieu of chemicals, and the efficacy of each individual chemical is not the sole factor in determining CAR's activity in mixture modeling.									25	1	0	24	0	26			1096-6080			WOS:000261889900010	18832183	
J	Childers, Ashley Kay; Visagamurthy, Gurucharann; Taaffe, Kevin								Prioritizing Patients for Evacuation from a Health-Care Facility								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD					2137			38	45		10.3141/2137-05			2009	2009	The success of a health-care facility evacuation depends on communication and decision making at all levels of the organization, from the coordinators at incident command to the clinical staff that carry out the evacuation. One key decision is the order in which each patient is chosen for transport. While a health-care facility evacuation is largely dependent on the availability of transportation resources (both personnel and vehicles) as well as receiving facilities, the typical planning assumption is that all patients will be transferred. However, the availability of these resources, as well as time, may not allow for the successful evacuation of all patients. The proposed two-phase modeling approach develops a decision framework for prioritizing patient evacuations, with unique classifications of patient health, rates of evacuation, and survivability affecting the choice. The question of who is transported next is explored in several scenarios (in terms of physical processing estimates as well as competing, ethically motivated objectives). Insights and observations into the creation of a prioritization policy follow. The observations from dynamic programming are extended; simulation analysis is used to observe system performance under many of the same scenarios. The prioritization guidelines developed in this paper will help determine the need and allocation of transportation resources.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0361-1981			WOS:000274589500006

Laboratory Investigation of Moisture Damage in Warm-Mix Asphalt Containing Moist Aggregate								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD					2126			115	124		10.3141/2126-14			2009	2009	In recent years, rising energy prices, global warming, and more stringent environmental regulations have generated interest in warm-mix asphalt (WMA) technologies as a means to decrease energy consumption and emissions associated with conventional hot-mix asphalt. In this study, a laboratory investigation was conducted of moisture damage in WMA mixtures containing moist aggregates. Indirect tensile strength (ITS), tensile strength ratio, deformation, and toughness tests were performed to determine the mixtures' moisture susceptibilities. The experimental design included two percentages of moisture content (0% and similar to 0.5% by weight of the dry mass of the aggregate), two WMA additives (Asphamin and Sasobit), and three aggregate sources. In this study 15 mix designs were performed, and 180 specimens were tested. Test results indicated that, as expected, dry ITS values were affected by aggregate moisture and hydrated lime contents, whereas a WMA additive did not significantly alter the dry ITS and toughness values. Statistical analysis showed no significant differences in the wet ITS values of WMA mixture of three types of mixtures (control, Asphamin, and Sasobit) under identical conditions (same moisture and lime contents). Statistical analysis also showed that wet ITS values, generally, were statistically different for mixtures made with various aggregate sources. The deformation resistance values of mixtures containing moisture were lower than those of mixtures made with dry aggregate. However, the results indicated that the addition of hydrated lime increased the deformation resistance of all mixtures.									37	0	0	0	0	37			0361-1981			WOS:000273066700014

Field Performance Study of a Regional WiMAX Network for Intelligent Transportation System Applications								TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD					2129			121	128		10.3141/2129-14			2009	2009	Of the various advanced wireless communication technologies used for intelligent transportation systems (ITS), WiMAX has recently received much attention because of its potential to provide broadband network connectivity, large coverage areas, quality assurance, and mobile access. However, few studies have focused on the deployment, operational, and performance issues of using WiMAX networks for ITS applications in a real roadway environment. This study performed a field performance evaluation of a regional WiMAX network in West Virginia by using important network metrics, including uplink and downlink throughput, signal strength, and connectivity level. On the basis of performance analysis, this paper discusses the feasibility and suitability of a regional WiMAX network deployment for a wireless sensor-based traffic surveillance system in terms of frequency, power, and client side radio requirements. This study provides an insight into the feasibility of using WiMAX to address ITS applications. It will benefit transportation agencies and other stakeholders to support decision making in the deployment and operation of a WiMAX-based ITS network in the future.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0361-1981			WOS:000273679600014

This paper focused on a rheological investigation of three PMA binders, graded as PG 76-22, containing two warm additives (Aspha-min (R) and Sasobit (R)) available commercially. The main rheological factors selected in this study were relationships between loading and response as a function of time, temperature and frequency using a Bohlin Dynamic Shear Rheometer II. The results suggested that the two warm additives positively influenced the performance of PMA binders.

While prior research has examined various antecedents to trust, we investigated two trust-building mechanisms more in depth: Web site trust and vendor reputation. We tried to understand the relative effectiveness of these two important mechanisms to provide online businesses with a clear recommendation of how to establish trust in an effective and efficient manner. Drawing from the literature on trust, we proposed vendor reputation to be more effective than Web site trust. Moreover, we examined a potential complementary effect of these mechanisms so as to provide online businesses with a deeper understanding of how to derive superior trust. We hypothesize a small such effect. The study proposes a laboratory experiment to test the model.					15th Americas Conference on Information Systems15th Americas Conference on Information Systems	AUG 06-09, 2009AUG 06-09, 2009		San Francisco, CASan Francisco, CA	1	0	0	0	0	1			1865-1348		978-3-642-03131-1	WOS:000270328800012

Virginia Museum of Natural History Special Publication				16				409	416					2009	2009	The widespread leafhopper Acinopterus acuminatus (Cicadellidae) was found consistently on moss phlox (Phlox subulata) during a study of insect diversity of this prostrate polemoniaceous plant in mid-Appalachian shale barrens and outcrops. Moss phlox was sampled at irregular intervals from 1989 to 1995, mainly April to June, from south- central Pennsylvania to southwestern Virginia. The leafhopper was observed 77 times at 34 sites and was present in classic shale barrens such as Kates Mountain, West Virginia, and Millboro, Virginia. This apparently bivoltine leafhopper overwintered as eggs; frst instars appeared by mid-April. Third instars typically were observed in mid- May, late instars from late May to late June, and the frst adults as early as mid- to late June. The presence of third instars in early August and late instars in mid-August probably represented a second generation. Adults were present on 1 October 1994, the latest date that moss phlox was sampled. Other nymphal hosts of A. acuminatus in shale barrens were Helianthus divaricatus and Symphyotrichum oblongifolium (Asteraceae), Silene caroliniana (Caryophyllaceae), and Penstemon canescens (Scrophulariaceae). Outside of mid-Appalachian shale barrens, P. subulata (and P. pilosa) was a host in two relict prairies, including Buffalo Beats, in southeastern Ohio; the leafhopper also was found on P. subulata in a dolomite glade in Virginia and on P. nivalis in the sandhills of South Carolina. Even though A. acuminatus has been recorded from grasses, nymphs appear to develop on various forbs.									0	0	0	0	0	0						ZOOREC:ZOOR14610070140

We develop an O(m log n) algorithm for solving this problem in a bipartite assignment graph with n nodes and m edges. When edge costs are present, we show that it is NP-hard to compute a stable assignment of minimum cost, a result that stands in stark contrast with most other stable matching problems (e.g., the stable marriage and stable allocation problems) for which we can efficiently optimize over the set of all stable assignments.					3rd International Workshop on Algorithms and Computation3rd International Workshop on Algorithms and Computation	FEB 18-20, 2009FEB 18-20, 2009		Indian Stat Inst, Calcutta, INDIAIndian Stat Inst, Calcutta, INDIA	3	0	0	0	0	3			0302-9743		978-3-642-00201-4	WOS:000264553900021

The objective of this study was to develop optimization models to analyze effects of groundwater policies on the Ogallala Aquifer and evaluate economic impacts on the Southern High Plains of Texas. The results of this study indicate that a policy that restricts the quantity of groundwater pumped conserved more water over the 50-year time horizon than implementation of a water use fee, but at a higher cost to local economies.									4	0	0	1	0	4			1366-7017			WOS:000270174300002

In order to identify desirable material properties of such construct, the biomechanical, histological, histochemical and biochemical properties of fetal, perinatal and adult porcine heart valve leaflets have been systematically investigated. It have been shown that increasing in heart valve stiffness during ontogenesis correlates with accumulation of collagen type 1 and increasing level of collagen cross-linking. Tissue spheroids biofabricated from human fat tissue derived stem cells have been employed to engineer leaflet-like construct on compliant electrospun scaffold using self-assembly or tissue fusion approach. Incubation of tissue engineered heart valve leaflet construct with TGF beta as well as periostin transfection significantly increased stiffness of tissue engineered heart valve leaflet. These data demonstrated that the heart valve can be biofabricated by tissue fusion or self-assembly of closely placed tissue spheroids and that chemically and genetically induced accelerated tissue maturation and collagen deposition can enhance mechanical properties of tissue engineered leaflet. Further optimization of accelerated tissue maturation technologies could eventually lead to development of living autologous human heart valve tissue engineered construct with natural-like biomechanical properties suitable for pediatric cardiac patients.					11th International Congress of the IUPESM/World Congress on Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering11th International Congress of the IUPESM/World Congress on Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering	SEP 07-12, 2009SEP 07-12, 2009	IUPESM; Int Org Med Phys (IOMP)IUPESM; Int Org Med Phys (IOMP)	Munich, GERMANYMunich, GERMANY	0	0	0	0	0	0			1680-0737		978-3-642-03899-0	WOS:000282043000066

The primary purpose of these simulations is to determine whether the eventual state of the surface, once it has reached a steady state, is independent of the starting structure. It is found that while independently realized amorphous carbon structures give rise to similar impact-modified surfaces, the graphitic surface evolves towards a somewhat different structure. Including or neglecting a realistic treatment of the nonbonded interactions in the graphite bombardment does not result in large differences in the impact-modified structure, although the penetration depth is considerably less when nonbonded interactions are included.					26th International Conference on Photonic, Electronic and Atomic Collisions26th International Conference on Photonic, Electronic and Atomic Collisions	JUL 22-28, 2009JUL 22-28, 2009	CRYOGENIC Ltd; IOP; Kalamazoo Cty Convent & Visitors Bur; Natl Electrostat Corp; PhysMath Cent; RoentDek Handels GmbH; Taylor & Francis Grp; WIENER Corp; WMU, Dept Phys; WMU, Coll Arts & Sci; WMU, Off Vice President Res; WMU, Grad Coll; WMU, Diether H Haenicke Inst Global EducCRYOGENIC Ltd; IOP; Kalamazoo Cty Convent & Visitors Bur; Natl Electrostat Corp; PhysMath Cent; RoentDek Handels GmbH; Taylor & Francis Grp; WIENER Corp; WMU, Dept Phys; WMU, Coll Arts & Sci; WMU, Off Vice President Res; WMU, Grad Coll; WMU, Diether H Haenicke Inst Global Educ	Western Michigan Univ, Kalamazoo, MIWestern Michigan Univ, Kalamazoo, MI	3	0	0	0	0	3			1742-6588		*****************	WOS:000282024600059

The MLA projects a composite pattern formed by its focal spots into a microchamber for optical sorting in a microscopic system. This approach enables passive, high power, efficient, and continuous microfluidic sorting without requiring complicated optical assembly.

Kinetic Modeling of Surface-Initiated Photoiniferter-Mediated Photopolymerization in Presence of Tetraethylthiuram Disulfide								MACROMOLECULES				41	24			9612	9618		10.1021/ma702516w			DEC 23 2008	2008	A rate equation-based kinetic model is developed to investigate the effect of important reaction parameters on surface-initiated photoiniferter-mediated photopolymerization (SI-PMP) of methyl methacrylate. In particular, the effect of incident light intensity and concentration of added deactivating species, tetraethylthiuram disulfide (TED), on the growth kinetics of surface-tethered poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) layers was studied in detail. In accord with experimental results, model predictions suggest that maximum rates of PMMA layer growth observed during initial stages of SI-PMP increase as TED concentration ([TED]) is decreased and as light intensity is increased. Conversely, the maximum thickness of the PMMA layers, which is defined as the thickness at which 99% of the surface-tethered polymer chains are irreversibly terminated, increases as [TED] increases and as fight intensity decreases. As light intensity and added deactivator affect the number of propagating surface-tethered radicals, findings from this study delineate strategies for optimizing the formation of surface-tethered PMMA brushes by SI-PMP and creating block copolymer brushes.									12	0	0	0	0	12			0024-9297			WOS:000261767400017

The model is constructed in such a way that it can be readily integrated into commercial finite-element programs like ANSYS/Autodyn [ANSYS/Autodyn version 11.0, User Documentation, Century Dynamics Inc., a subsidiary of ANSYS Inc., 20071 and ABAQUS/Explicit [ABAQUS version 6.7, User Documentation, Dessault Systems, 2007] as a user material subroutine. To validate the model, a series of transient non-linear dynamics simulations of the transverse impact of armor-grade composite laminates with two types of bullets/projectiles is carried out. The results obtained are next compared with their experimental counterparts. This comparison revealed that a relatively good agreement is obtained between the experimental and the computational analysis relative to: (a) the success of the armor panels of different areal densities in defeating the bullets at different initial bullet velocities; (b) post-mortem spatial distribution of damage within the panels; (c) the temporal evolution of a bulge at the back-face of the armor; and (d) the existence of three distinct armor-penetration stages (i.e. an initial filament shearing/cutting dominated stage, an intermediate stage characterized by pronounced filament/matrix de-bonding/decohesion and the final stage associated with the extensive bulging of the armor panel).

A modified version of the OPLS-AA (Optimized Parameter for Liquid Simulation All-Atom) force field of Jorgensen et al. has been used to study the interfacial behavior of semifluorinated diblocks. Aqueous interfaces are found to be sharp, with correspondingly large values of the interfacial tension. Due to the reduced hydrophobicity of the protonated block compared to the fluorinated block, hydrogen enhancement is observed at the interface. Water dipoles in the interfacial region are found to be oriented nearly parallel to the liquid-liquid interface. A number of protonated alkanes and perfluorinated alkanes are found to be mutually miscible with the semifluorinated diblocks. For these liquids, interdiffusion follows the expected Fickian behavior, and concentration-dependent diffusivities are determined.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1520-6106			WOS:000261652900008	19367794

Here, we have enlisted the aid of a unique set of embryo-aggregated lineage chimeric mice derived from C57/BL6 and FVB donors to study the interplay between local and systemic tumor immunity and tolerance in rejection of mouse B16 melanoma cells, syngeneic to the C57/BL6 donor strain.Methods: Two variants of embryo-aggregated chimeric mice with either variable or no contribution of C57-derived cells to their skin were generated by the fusion of different ratios of morula stage blastomers. Chimeric mice were analyzed for s. c. growth of B16 tumors in comparison to their respective donor strains as well as normal F1 hybrids, and the relative frequencies of cellular components of the immune system by FACS analysis of peripheral blood or lymph node cells.Results: B16 tumors grew significantly faster in mice with full chimerism in their skin as compared to syngeneic C57 or semi-syngeneic C57 x FVB F1 hosts. In contrast, s. c. tumor growth was either absent or significantly reduced in chimeric mice lacking C57-derived cells in their skin, but tolerant to C57 tissue in other organs. Comparison of the relative frequencies of various immune cells in the periphery via FACS-analysis did not reveal any significant differences between the two types of chimeric mice with respect to their donor strains.Conclusion: Our data suggest a complex interplay between mechanisms of local peripheral tolerance and innate antitumor mechanisms possibly involving NK cell allorecognition as a basis for the differential growth or rejection of B16 tumors in these unique chimeric mice, which we suggest to constitute a valuable new model system for the study of immune-mediated tumor rejection.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1471-2407			WOS:000262704400001	19087311

In this study, novel molecular dynamics techniques were employed in order to determine the change in free energy for the adsorption of a solvated nine-residue peptide (GGGG-K-GGGG) to a crystalline polylactide surface in an effort to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms that govern protein adsorption. This system, like many others, involves two distinct types of sampling problems: a spatial sampling problem, which arises due to entropic effects creating barriers in the free energy profile, and a conformational sampling problem, which occurs due to barriers in the potential energy landscape. In a two-step process that addresses each sampling problem in turn, the technique of biased replica exchange molecular dynamics was refined and applied in order to overcome these sampling problems and, using the information available at the atomic level of detail afforded by molecular simulation, both quantify and characterize the interactions between the peptide and a relevant biomaterial surface. The results from these simulations predict a fairly strong adsorption response with an adsorption free energy of -2.5 +/- 0.6 kcal/mol (mean +/- 95% confidence interval), with adsorption primarily due to hydrophobic interactions between the nonpolar groups of the peptide and the PLA surface. As part of a larger and ongoing effort involving both simulation and experimental investigations, this work contributes to the goal of transforming the engineering of biomaterials from one dominated by trial-and-error to one which is guided by an atomic-level understanding of the interactions that occur at the tissue-biomaterial interface.									32	1	0	13	0	33			0743-7463			WOS:000261631700043	19360943

Coupled with radiation exposure, this phenomenon may place astronauts at a greater risk for mission-critical fractures. In a previous study, we identified a profound and prolonged loss of trabecular bone (29-39%) in mice following exposure to an acute, 2 Gy dose of radiation simulating both solar and cosmic sources. However, because skeletal strength depends oil trabecular and cortical bone, accurate assessment of strength requires analysis of both bone compartments. The objective of the present Study wits to examine various properties of cortical bone in Mice following exposure to multiple types of spaceflight-relevant radiation. Nine-week old, female C57BL/6 mice were sacrificed 110 days after exposure to a single, whole body, 2 Gy dose of gamma, proton, carbon, or iron radiation. Femora were evaluated with biomechanical testing, microcomputed tomography, quantitative histomorphometry, percent mineral content, and micro-hardness analysis. Compared to non-irradiated controls, there were significant differences compared to carbon or iron radiation for only fracture force, medullary area and mineral content. A greater differential effect based oil linear energy transfer (LET) level may be present: high-LET (carbon or iron) particle irradiation was associated with a decline in structural properties (maximum force, fracture force, medullary area, and cortical porosity) and mineral composition compared to low-LET radiation (gamma and proton). Bone loss following irradiation appears to be largely specific to trabecular bone and may indicate unique biological microenvironments and microdosimetry conditions. However, the limited time points examined and non-haversian skeletal structure of the mice employed highlight the need for further investigation. (C) 2008 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This first paper in the series presents the mathematical modeling and development of a memory-based robust adaptive controller for the nanomanipulator driving principle. Unlike widely used Cartesian-structure nanomanipulators, the MM3A is equipped with revolute-piezoelectric actuators which result in outstanding performance in controlling the nanomanipulator's tip alignment during the nanomanipulation. However, the RRP structure of the nanomanipulator introduces complexity in kinematic and dynamic equations of the system which needs to be addressed in order to control the nanomanipulation process. Dissimilar to the ordinary piezoelectric actuators which provide only a couple of micrometers working range, the piezoelectric actuators utilized in MM3A, namely Nanomotors (R), provide wide range of action (120 degrees in revolute actuators and 12 mm in prismatic actuator) with nanoscale precision (0.1 mu rad in revolute actuators and 0.25 nm in prismatic actuator). This wide range of action combined with nanoscale precision is achieved using a special stick/slip moving principle of the Nanomotors (R). However, such stick/slip motion results in stepping movement of the MM3A. Hence, due to the RRP structure and stepping movement principle of the MM3A nanomanipulator, development and implementation of an appropriate controller for such nanomanipulation process is not a trivial task. In this paper, a novel memory-based robust adaptive controller is proposed to overcome such shortfalls. Following the development the controller, numerical simulations are preformed to demonstrate the positioning performance capability of the controller in a variety of nanomanipulation tasks.

This second paper in the series presents the optimal utilization of the visual servoing and force sensor feedbacks for use in the nanomanipulation tasks discussed in the first paper (Part A). More specifically, the visual servoing and force feedback structures are investigated through extensive simulations in order to reveal issues in practical implementation. For this, a set of numerical simulations is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of utilizing just vision feedback as well as force feedback only, at both macro and microscale. It is shown that although each feedback module could provide reasonably accurate results at either macro or microscale, precise positioning of such nanomanipulator requires employment of both modules with a proper (optimal) switching strategy. This paper extends our previously introduced robust controller for nanomanipulator positioning and offers a novel switching framework to be used between vision feedback and force feedback modules. Utilizing a soft switching function, the problem of jump in the actuator force during fused vision/force control of the nanomanipulation can be overcome. Following the development of the soft switching approach, numerical simulations are used to verify the positioning performance and effectiveness of each switching strategy. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The mean diameter of microparticles was 110.37 mu m and the microparticles had generally spherical and some wrinkled surfaces. The fibrinolytic activities of encapsulated and non-encapsulated CGJ extract were measured at various ranges of pH and temperature. When non-encapsulated CGJ extract was exposed to Simulated gastric juice of pH 2.0, the fibrinolytic activity was rapidly reduced. However, fibrinolytic activity of encapsulated CGJ extract ( 14.27 units) was significantly higher than that of non-encapsulated CGJ extract (4.15 units). The fibrinolytic activity of non-encapsulated CGJ extract decreased rapidly with increased temperature, but stability of fibrinolytic activity of encapsulated CGJ was improved under high temperature conditions. These results indicate that the microencapsulation technique is an effective tool to protect the fibrinolytic activity of CGJ extract from ingestion and heating effects. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Quantum dots with unique optical properties are commonly composed of cadmium contained semiconductors. Cadmium is potentially hazardous, and toxicity of such quantum dots to living cells, and humans, is not yet systematically investigated. Therefore, search for less toxic materials with similar targeting and optical properties is of further interest. Whereas, the investigation of luminescence nanoparticles as light sources for cancer therapy is very interesting. Despite advances in neurosurgery and radiotherapy the prognosis for patients with malignant gliomas has changed little for the last decades. Cancer treatment requires high accuracy in delivering ionizing radiation to reduce toxicity to surrounding tissues. Recently some research has been focused in developing photosensitizing quantum dots for production of radicals upon absorption of visible light. In spite of the fact that visible light is safe, this approach is suitable to treat only superficial tumours. Ionizing radiation (X-rays and gamma rays) penetrate much deeper thus offering a big advantage in treating patients with tumours in internal organs. Such concept of using quantum dots and nanoparticles to yield electrons and radicals in photodynamic and radiation therapies as well their combination is reviewed in this article.

Alterations in CDH15 and KIRREL3 in Patients with Mild to Severe Intellectual Disability								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS				83	6			703	713		10.1016/j.ajhg.2008.10.020			DEC 12 2008	2008	Cell-adhesion molecules play critical roles in brain development, as well as maintaining synaptic structure, function, and plasticity. Here we have found the disruption of two genes encoding putative cell-adhesion molecules, CDH15 (cadherin superfamily) and KIRREL3 (immunoglobulin superfamily), by a chromosomal translocation t(11;16) in a female patient with intellectual disability (ID). We screened coding regions of these two genes in a cohort of patients with ID and controls and identified four nonsynonymous CDH15 variants and three nonsynonymous KIRREL3 variants that appear rare and unique to ID. These variations altered highly conserved residues and were absent in more than 600 unrelated patients with ID and 800 control individuals. Furthermore, in vivo expression studies showed that three of the CDH15 variations adversely altered its ability to mediate cell-cell adhesion. We also show that in neuronal cells, human KIRREL3 colocalizes and interacts with the synaptic scaffolding protein, CASK, recently implicated in X-linked brain malformation and ID. Taken together, our data suggest that alterations in CDH15 and KIRREL3, either alone or in combination with other factors, could play a role in phenotypic expression of ID in some patients.									51	0	0	47	0	54			0002-9297			WOS:000261822100005	19012874

It represents over 50 years of satellite, rocket, and ground-based wind measurements via a compact Fortran 90 subroutine. The computer model is a function of geographic location, altitude, day of the year, solar local time, and geomagnetic activity. It includes representations of the zonal mean circulation, stationary planetary waves, migrating tides, and the seasonal modulation thereof. HWM07 is composed of two components, a quiet time component for the background state described in this paper and a geomagnetic storm time component (DWM07) described in a companion paper.									62	13	3	0	0	71			2169-9380	2169-9402		WOS:000261688600007

Capillary Channel Polymer Fibers as Structural Templates for Ligament Regeneration								AATCC REVIEW				8	12			36	40					DEC 2008	2008	Capillary channel polymer (CC-P) fibers fabricated by melt extrusion have aligned surface channels in the fiber direction. This inherent surface structure offers a unique and industrially viable approach for cellular topographic guidance on three-dimensional constructs. In this fundamental study, the ability of the channels to support the adhesion, alignment, and organization of fibroblasts was demonstrated and found to be superior to round fiber controls. The results demonstrated greater uniformity of seeding and accelerated formation of multi-layered three-dimensional biomass for the CC-P fibers relative to those with a circular cross section. These novel topographic fibers potentially serve as templates for regeneration of important and highly-organized cellular structures such as the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) of the knee.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1532-8813			WOS:000261728000007

Producers' complex risk management choices								AGRIBUSINESS				24	1			31	54		10.1002/agr.20145			WIN 2008	2008	Producers have a wide variety of risk management instruments available, making their choice(s) complex. The way producers deal with this complexity can vary and may influence the impact that the determinants, such as risk aversion, have on their choices. A recently developed choice bracketing framework recognizes that producers are unable to evaluate all alternatives simultaneously and that to manage a complex task, they often group or bracket individual alternatives and their consequences together in choice sets. Data on 1,105 U.S. producers show that producers do not use all available combinations of risk management tools and that the influence of the determinants of producer's risk management decisions are not necessarily the same across risk management strategies within and across bracketing levels. The findings may help resolve puzzling results on the role that well-known determinants of risk management behavior have on producers' choices, extending knowledge on producers' risk management behavior. Further, the findings have managerial implications for policy makers and agribusiness companies that provide risk management services.

The curl part of the FEM matrix is shown to be singular. ne paper explains how low-frequency instabilities are related to this singularity. Based on this analysis, an LU recombination method is implemented in FEM to solve the low-frequency problem. This method, which has previously been applied to the method of moments (MOM), reduces the errors in the curl part of the matrix and enforces the correct gauge condition. Moreover, the method is restructured to work more efficiently for sparse finite element matrices.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1054-4887			WOS:000262874600002

The review focuses primarily on extensions to the classic entrainment model of Morton et al. (1956; MTT). Recent analytic solutions for the rise height in a stratified environment, for the rise height of turbulent fountains, and for the near-source flow in large area source plumes are reviewed. Extensions to the theory of MTT are then reviewed, including models for plumes with a buoyancy flux that varies with height and for plumes with a buoyancy flux that varies with time. Recent experimental results are also reviewed and compared to these theoretical developments. Some open questions in turbulent plume theory are then discussed. It is shown that MTT are unable to model the rise of weak fountains satisfactorily and the significance of this result for the rise height of plumes in a stratified environment and, more generally, turbulent mixing at a density interface are discussed. The value of the entrainment coefficient a is also discussed. Methods for measuring a are reviewed and variable entrainment models and their limitations are discussed. Finally the appropriate values of a for plumes, jets and fountains are discussed.

J	Fortnum, B. A.; Gooden, D.								Transmission and Survival of Ralstonia solanacearum on Tobacco Machinery								Beitraege zur Tabakforschung International				23	3			137	143					DEC 2008	2008	Bacterial wilt (Ralstonia solanacearum) is an extremely damaging disease of flue-cured tobacco in the southeastern USA. It is generally believed that R. solanacearum infects field-grown tobacco through the roots. Epidemics of bacterial wilt are so common within South Carolina that the organism must be spread in a more rapid and efficient manner than the movement of soil on equipment. Field trials conducted at the Pee Dee Research and Education Center measured the spread of R. solancearum down a row of tobacco from a point inoculation following machine flower removal (topping), leaf harvest or stalk cutting. Machine topping, leaf harvest and stalk cutting increased disease 879%, 1245%, and 800% respectively within a 20 plant row when compared to hand topping, hand harvesting or a non contaminated stalk cutter (cv. K 326, P <= 0.001). A survey was conducted to determine if R. solanacearum is a common contaminate on harvesting equipment in South Carolina. Tobacco harvesting equipment was randomly selected within Horry and Marion counties and sampled for R. solanacearum by streaking sterile cotton swabs on the harvester surface, then restreaking the swab onto an enriched Tetrazolium-based selective media (SM3). R.solanacearum-like colonies that developed on SM3 were inoculated onto cv. Rutgers tomato to confirm pathogenicity. Bacteria from diseased plants were reisolated on SM3 and R. solanacearum identity confirmed with an immuno strip test. Pathogenic populations of R. solanacearum were recovered from steel defoliator knives, rubber defoliators and steel guides (51, 50 and 50% of sampled harvesters respectively). The Survival of R. solanacearum on mechanical steel topper blades was determined by running the topper through infected tobacco plants and sequentially sampling the steel knives over time for viable populations of R. solanacearum. Sterile cotton swabs were swept across the blade surface, then streaked onto SM3 media. Confirmed pathogenic populations of R. solanacearum could be recovered oil SM3 media for Lip to 6 h after topping R. solanacearum-infected tobacco. The efficiency of machine transmission of R. solanacearum and it's longevity on tobacco machinery may be responsible for the high frequency of bacterial wilt epidemics in flue-cured tobacco occurring in the Southeastern USA and its movement into previously clean fields.

Higher turnover frequencies for 1-heptyne hydrogenation and less deactivation due to Pd leaching were obtained for the Pd/ZnAl(2)O(4)-33 nm catalyst. XPS and ESR results suggest that the presence of defects in larger crystallite size ZnAl(2)O(4) resulted in higher Pd dispersion and stronger interaction between Pd and the support.									13	0	0	0	0	13			1011-372X			WOS:000260774300016

Music may also be detrimental, but its impact on WM is not clear. This study assessed the effects of vocal music, equivalent instrumental music, and irrelevant speech on WM in order to clarify what aspect of music affects performance and the degree of impairment. To study this, 60 college students completed WM tests (digit span) in the presence of irrelevant speech, vocal music, instrumental (karaoke) versions of the vocal music, and silence. As expected, both speech and vocal music degraded performance. WM performance with instrumental music was better than with vocal music but not significantly different from either silence or speech. Familiarity with song lyrics had little effect on performance. People were poor judges of the degree of memory impairment resulting from various irrelevant sounds.									7	0	0	2	0	7			1046-1310			WOS:000260774400005

Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Spo) TDG is a member of the MUG/TDG family that belongs to a uracil DNA glycosylase superfamily. This work investigates the DNA repair activity of Spo TDG on all four deaminated bases: xanthine (X) and oxanine (0) from guanine, hypoxanthine (I) from adenine, and uracil from cytosine. Unexpectedly, Spo TDG exhibits glycosylase activity on all deaminated bases in both double-stranded and single-stranded DNA in the descending order of X > I > U >> O. In comparison, human TDG only excises deaminated bases from G/U and, to a much lower extent, A/U and G/I base pairs. Amino acid substitutions in motifs I and 2 of Spo TDG show a significant impact on deaminated base repair activity. The overall mutational effects are characterized by a loss of glycosylase activity on oxanine in all five mutants. L157I in motif 1 and G288M in motif 2 retain xanthine DNA glycosylase (XDG) activity but reduce excision of hypoxanthine and uracil, in particular in C/I, single-stranded hypoxanthine (ss-I), A/U, and single-stranded uracil (ss-U). A proline substitution at 1289 in motif 2 causes a significant reduction in XDG activity and a loss of activity on CA, ss-I, A/U, C/U, G/U, and ss-U. S291G only retains reduced activity on T/I and G/I base pairs. S163A can still excise hypoxanthine and uracil in mismatched base pairs but loses XDG activity, making it the closest mutant, functionally, to human TDG. The relationship among amino acid substitutions, binding affinity and base recognition is discussed.

ASYMPTOTICS AND CONSISTENT BOOTSTRAPS FOR DEA ESTIMATORS IN NONPARAMETRIC FRONTIER MODELS								ECONOMETRIC THEORY				24	6			1663	1697		10.1017/S0266466608080651			DEC 2008	2008	Nonparametric data envelopment analysis (DEA) estimators based on linear programming methods have been widely applied in analyses of productive efficiency. The distributions of these estimators remain unknown except in the simple case of one input and one output, and previous bootstrap methods proposed for inference have not been proved consistent, making inference doubtful. This paper derives the asymptotic distribution of DEA estimators under variable returns to scale. This result is used to prove consistency of two different bootstrap procedures (one based on subsampling, the other based on smoothing). The smooth bootstrap requires smoothing the irregularly bounded density of inputs and outputs and smoothing the DEA frontier estimate. Both bootstrap procedures allow for dependence of the inefficiency process on output levels and the mix of inputs in the case of input-oriented measures, or on input levels and the mix of outputs in the case of output-oriented measures.									78	0	0	2	1	78			0266-4666			WOS:000260133900008

Lead". This publication sets out the derivation of Soil Guideline Values for lead contamination. Values for soil lead that are protective of the health of children and also for adults are derived using the model recommended by an international task force working under the auspices of the Society for Environmental Geochemistry and Health (SEGH) (Wixson and Davies 1993, 1994). Detailed examination of the DEFRA publication shows it uses unrealistic values for two variables in the SEGH model. The consequence is both actual and has potential adverse societal impacts.

MORTALITY OF THE LOBATE LAC SCALE, PARATACHARDINA PSEUDOLOBATA (HEMIPTERA: KERRIIDAE), AT NEAR OR BELOW FREEZING TEMPERATURES								FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST				91	4			674	678					DEC 2008	2008	The ability of the invasive lobate lac scale, Paratachardina pseudolobata Kondo & Gullan, to survive exposure to near or below freezing temperatures (-25, -15, -10, -5, 0, 5, and 10 degrees C) for extended durations (6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h) was assessed in the laboratory. Exposure at 10 degrees C for 6 to 72 h did not cause significant mortality in immature and adult lobate lac scales. All nymphs and adults were killed after exposure to very low temperatures (-25 to -10 degrees C) for 6 h. All nymphs were killed within 24 h at -5, 0, and 5 degrees C, while about 2% of adults were still alive after 72 h at 0 and 5 degrees C. Results suggested that the range expansion of the lobate lac scale in the United States will be limited by winter temperature. The lobate lac scale may have a higher potential to invade areas where the average winter temperature do not drop below freezing for an extended duration (3 or more consecutive days), such as southern Florida, Rio Grande Valley in Texas, and Colorado river Delta between California and Arizona.									3	0	0	2	0	3			0015-4040			WOS:000261564100023

The authors draw on social information processing and social learning theories to argue that OCB is contagious, or affected by the OCB of employees with whom a focal employee maintains social network ties. A study of admissions department employees reveals that strong advice ties between employees are positively and significantly related to similarity in OCB, whereas strong friendship ties and weak ties are not. Implications for research and practice, including suggestions for influencing ethical behavior in organizations, are discussed.									20	0	0	0	0	20			1059-6011			WOS:000260998400007		
J	Verderber, Stephen								Evidence-Based Design for Healthcare in Post-Katrina New Orleans: Current Dilemmas								HERD-HEALTH ENVIRONMENTS RESEARCH & DESIGN JOURNAL				1	2			71	76					WIN 2008	2008	New Orleans continues to struggle to rebuild from the devastation inflicted by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. More than 1,800 perished in its aftermath. Katrina stands as the costliest catastrophe in U.S. history, and the city's healthcare infrastructure is similarly striving to resuscitate itself. The incorporation of evidence-based design and research (EBD&R) in the reconstitution of the city's healthcare infrastructure offers a promising direction to improve healthcare outcomes. Recent efforts to incorporate EBD&R in New Orleans' recovery are summarized. EBD&R interventions are needed that take certain key dilemmas into consideration-embracing the adaptive reuse possibilities of historic healthcare facilities, private-public sector collaborations in acute care and in neighborhood-based outpatient care environments, and interventions to serve the city's growing population of medically underserved residents.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1937-5867			WOS:000273357100012	21161902

The Effect of Formal Mentoring Program Characteristics on Organizational Attraction								HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT QUARTERLY				19	4			323	349		10.1002/hrdq.1244			WIN 2008	2008	Although the extant mentoring literature describes the post-hire benefits of mentoring programs, less is known about how mentoring programs affect pre-hire perceptions of organizations-perceptions that may have subsequent implications for the success of mentoring programs and other HRD practices. To explore this issue, we used a policy-capturing design to examine the influence of formal mentoring program characteristics on organizational attraction. Results from a sample of 254 undergraduate participants indicated preferences for organizations offering mentorship programs that are voluntary, that give protege input into the choice of mentor, that link proteges with individuals who hold higher rank (that is, supervisors), and that offer both career and psychosocial support. Furthermore, one of these relationships was moderated by participants' Need for Dominance. Implications for practice and research are discussed.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1044-8004			WOS:000207803700004

Problems with detecting assumed mediation using the hierarchical multiple regression strategy								HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT REVIEW				18	4	SI		294	310		10.1016/j.hrmr.2008.07.009			DEC 2008	2008	In human resource management (FIRM) and allied fields (e.g.. organizational behavior, management, and industrial and organizational psychology), tests of mediation are frequently conducted using the hierarchical multiple regression (HMR) strategy of Baron and Kenny [Baron, It M., & Kenny. D. A. (1986). The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, 1173-1182). Although previous research has identified a number of serious problems with this approach, the present study adds to the literature by identifying yet additional problems with its use in inferring the existence of mediation. Using a statistical simulation, we found that certain patterns of correlation coefficients guarantee inferences about mediation, whereas other patterns preclude such inferences. On the basis of various analyses including logistic regression and inspection of three-dimensional plots, we identified patterns of correlation coefficients needed to satisfy Baron and Kenny's [Baron, R. M., & Kenny, D. A. (1986). The moderator-mediator variable distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, 1173-1182] conditions for inferring mediation. The same patterns have no necessary relation to actual causal connections among variables in mediation models. Moreover, as a consequence of the failure of the HMR strategy to detect mediating effects, many instances of actual mediation in FIRM and allied fields may have gone undetected. In view of the foregoing, we conclude that the HMR strategy should no longer be used in testing for mediation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

It can be used effectively in a variety of problems that include compiler-level architectural optimization for improved performance and static software timing analysis. The approach is path implicit and scalable. The set of executable paths is stored implicitly using zero-suppressed binary decision diagrams. Functions that represent condition statements at the basic blocks are manipulated using binary decision diagrams. Postprocessing algorithms on the canonical data structures identify critical paths and other useful metrics such as a most frequently used critical path. Experimental results demonstrate the scalability of the proposed method.

Morphological selection in an extreme flow environment: body shape and waterfall-climbing success in the Hawaiian stream fish Sicyopterus stimpsoni								INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY				48	6			734	749		10.1093/icb/icn086			DEC 2008	2008	Synopsis Flow characteristics are a prominent factor determining body shapes in aquatic organisms, and correlations between body shape and ambient flow regimes have been established for man, fish species. In this study, we investigated the potential for a brief period of extreme flow to exert selection on the body shape of juvenile climbing Hawaiian gobiid fishes. Because of an amphidromous life history, juvenile gobies that complete an oceanic larval phase return to freshwater habitats, where they become adults. Returning juveniles often must scale waterfalls (typically with the use of a ventral sucker) in order to reach the habitats they will use as adults, thereby exposing these animals to brief periods of extreme velocities of flow. Hydrodynamic theory predicts that bodies with larger suckers and with lower heights that reduce drag would have improved climbing success and, thus, be well Suited to meet the demands of the flows in waterfalls. To test the potential for the flow environment of waterfalls to impose selection that could contribute to differences in body shape between islands, we subjected juvenile Sicyopterus stimpsoni to climbing trials Lip artificial waterfalls (similar to 100 body lengths) and measured differences in body shape between Successful and unsuccessful climbers. Waterfalls appear to represent a significant selective barrier to these fishes, as nearly 30% failed our climbing test. However, the effects of selection Oil morphology were not straight forward, as significant differences in shape between successful and Unsuccessful climbers did not always match hydrodynamic predictions. In both selection experiments and in adult fish collected from habitats with different prevailing conditions of flow (the islands of Hawai'i versus Kaua'i), lower head heights were associated with exposure to high-flow regimes, as predicted by hydrodynamic theory. Thus, a premium appears to be placed on the reduction of drag via head morphology throughout the ontogeny of this species. The congruence of phenotypic selection patterns observed in our experiments, with morphological character divergence documented among adult fish from Hawai'i and Kaua'i, suggests that differences in morphology between subpopulations of adult climbing gobies may result, at least in part, from the selective pressures of high-velocity flows encountered by migrating juveniles.

J	Rivera, Gabriel								Ecomorphological variation in shell shape of the freshwater turtle Pseudemys concinna inhabiting different aquatic flow regimes								INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE BIOLOGY				48	6			769	787		10.1093/icb/icn088			DEC 2008	2008	Synopsis Populations of species that inhabit a range of environments frequently display divergent morphologies that correlate with differences in ecological parameters. The velocity of water flow (i.e., flow velocity) is a critical aquatic environments that has been shown to influence morphology in a broad range of taxa. The focus Of this study was to evaluate the relationship between flow velocity and shell morphology for males and females of the semi-aquatic freshwater turtle Pseudemys concinna. For both sexes, the carapace and plastron show significant morphological differences between habitats characterized by slow-flowing (i.e., lentic) and fast-flowing (i.e., lotic) water. In general, the most prominent pattern for both sexes is that the shells of individuals from lotic habitats are more streamlined (small height-to-length ratio) than the shells of individuals from lentic habitats. Of the two shell components (carapace and plastron), the carapace shows greater divergence between habitats, particularly for males. These results are consistent with adaptations to flow velocity, and suggest that variation in shape may be more constrained in females. I also provide empirical evidence for an adaptive benefit of the observed shape change (i.e., drag reduction) and a brief comment oil the relative roles of genetic divergence and phenotypic plasticity in generating shape differences observed in this species.

Such measurements are desired to provide the maximum amount of information regarding the particles. This paper develops a method to analyze the information content of scattering measurements when applied to characterize the shape and size distribution function of spheroidal particles. For a specific application. this method enables the selection of the optimal set of conditions (in terms of the wavelengths and the scattering angles) to perform the scattering measurements. Numerical simulations have demonstrated that this method can significantly improve the determination of the shape and size distribution function of spheroidal particles based on multispectral scattering measurements. The results obtained here provide valuable insights into the optimal design of techniques and instruments for particle characterization using scattering measurements. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

P. marginatus was able to develop and complete its life cycle at 18, 20, 25, and 30 +/- 1 degrees C. At 15, 34, and 35 degrees C, the eggs hatched after 27.5, 5.9, and 5.5 d of incubation, respectively, but further development of the first-instar nymphs was arrested. No eggs hatched at 37 degrees C. The developmental time for egg to adult was the longest at 18 degrees C for both males and females. Approximately 80-90% of the eggs survived between 20 and 30 degrees C. The highest fecundity was at 25 degrees C with each female producing an average of 300 eggs. Adult longevity, and preoviposition and oviposition periods increased with decreasing temperature up to 25 degrees C. The proportion of females was approximate to 42% at 25 degrees C and was between 70 and 80% at 18, 20, and 30 degrees C. Adult males and females required 303.0 and 294.1 degree-days (DD), respectively, to complete their development. The estimated minimum temperature thresholds for the adult males and females were 14.5 and 13.9 degrees C, respectively. For adult males, the estimated optimum and maximum temperature thresholds were 28.7 and 31.9 degrees C; and for adult females, they were 28.4 and 32.1 degrees C, respectively. The ability of P. marginatus to develop, survive, and reproduce successfully between 18 and 30 degrees C suggests that it has the capability to develop and establish in areas within this temperature range.									12	4	0	14	1	18			0022-0493			WOS:000261430700012	19133459

More than 1800 persons died, and the disaster stands as the costliest in U. S. history. Over 200,000 former residents of New Orleans continue to reside elsewhere. The U. S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) emergency housing program, and specifically the design, manufacture, and deployment of its travel trailer housing units, remain the subject of controversy. The FEMA travel trailer program is critiqued, as is recent empirical evidence on the deleterious health outcomes experienced by many trailer occupants. The results of a pilot investigation are reported, whereby the post-occupancy assessments of a group of occupants of single-site FEMA trailer installations were compared to a group residing in two FEMA trailer park communities in New Orleans. Among the findings, the travel trailer unit was assessed by occupants as difficult to personalize to occupants' preferred patterns of use, inadequate in size, affording few site amenities, and little overall privacy, and the unit itself functioned as a source of chronic environmental stress. The findings are translated into a theoretical/operative model of person-environment interactions, to assist in further research on this subject.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1566-4910			WOS:000207708900007

Metal specificity in DNA damage prevention by sulfur antioxidants								JOURNAL OF INORGANIC BIOCHEMISTRY				102	12	SI		2036	2042		10.1016/j.jinorgbio.2008.06.010			DEC 2008	2008	Metals such as Cu(I) and Fe(II) generate hydroxyl radical ((center dot)OH) by reducing endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). Because antioxidants can ameliorate metal-mediated oxidative damage, we have quantified the ability of glutathione, a primary intracellular antioxidant, and other biological sulfur-containing compounds to inhibit metal-mediated DNA damage caused hydroxyl radical. In the CuI/H(2)O(2) system, six sulfur compounds, including both reduced and oxidized glutathione, inhibited DNA damage with IC(50) values ranging from 3.4 to 12.4 mu M. Glutathione and 3-carboxypropyl disulfide also demonstrated significant antioxidant activity with Fell and H(2)O(2). Additional gel electrophoresis and UV-vis spectroscopy studies confirm that antioxidant activity for sulfur compounds in the Cu(I) system is attributed to metal coordination, a previously unexplored mechanism. The antioxidant mechanism for sulfur compounds in the Fe(II) system, however, is unlike that of Cu(I). Our results demonstrate that glutathione and other sulfur compounds are potent antioxidants capable of preventing metal-mediated oxidative DNA damage at well below their biological concentrations. This novel metal-binding antioxidant mechanism may play a significant role in the antioxidant behavior of these sulfur compounds and help refine understanding of glutathione function in vivo.

Insular domains are technical domains that rely heavily on prior innovations within the same domain for subsequent innovations. We show that the returns to entering insular domains vary with the firm's depth and breadth of knowledge. By analysing data from 128 biotechnology firms over a 20-year period, we find that the relationship between depth of technological capabilities and technology impact is nuanced: depth is necessary but not sufficient for high impact innovation. Firms whose knowledge is spread over disparate domains have negative returns from entering insular domains. The implications of these findings for theories of innovation and the discovery of entrepreneurial opportunities are discussed.									36	0	0	0	0	36			0022-2380			WOS:000261065200006

J	Gallagher, Colin; Tunno, Ferebee								A small sample confidence interval for autoregressive parameters								JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE				138	12			3858	3868		10.1016/j.jspi.2008.02.001			DEC 1 2008	2008	This paper is concerned with interval estimation of an autoregressive parameter when the parameter space allows for magnitudes outside the unit interval. In this case, intervals based on the least-squares estimator tend to require a high level of numerical computation and can be unreliable for small sample sizes. Intervals based on the asymptotic distribution of instrumental variable estimators provide an alternative. If the instrument is taken to be the sign function, the interval is centered at the Cauchy estimator and a large sample interval can be created by estimating the standard error of this estimator. The interval proposed in this paper avoids estimating this standard error and results in a small sample improvement in coverage probability. In fact, small sample coverage is exact when the innovations come from a normal distribution. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0378-3758			WOS:000259755600021

International Comparison of Wind Tunnel Estimates of Wind Effects on Low-Rise Buildings: Test-Related Uncertainties								JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING-ASCE				134	12			1887	1890		10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9445(2008)134:12(1887)			DEC 2008	2008	The consistency of measurements in various wind tunnels is of concern to designers and code writers. This study attempts to quantify the variability of wind effects estimates based on tests conducted at six wind tunnel laboratories. Pressure tap measurements were made on wind tunnel models of four buildings. Comparisons were made between estimated 50th percenttiles of (1) peak positive moments in a frame section near the knee joint and (2) peak pressure coefficients of a roof tap nearest a building corner. Modeling of suburban terrain contributes significantly to the variability. Other factors are eave height, wind direction, and frame location within the building. Coefficients of variation were about 10-40%. A subsequent phase of this research entails a detailed analysis of the reasons for the variabilities. The results could help future improvement of wind load factors that account for all relevant uncertainties in the estimation of wind effects and efforts to improve and standardize wind tunnel simulations.									18	1	0	1	0	18			0733-9445			WOS:000260940200010		
J	Baker, Thomas L.; Meyer, Tracy; Johnson, James D.								Individual differences in perceptions of service failure and recovery: the role of race and discriminatory bias								JOURNAL OF THE ACADEMY OF MARKETING SCIENCE				36	4			552	564		10.1007/s11747-008-0089-x			WIN 2008	2008	This article investigates the role of contextual cues in the evaluation of a service failure. Empirical data demonstrates that although discrimination is a factor in the evaluation of a service failure for black (vs. white) customers, contextual cues also play a role in the evaluation of the encounter. When a black customer experiences a service failure, the failure will be evaluated more severely when no other black customers are present. In addition, the context of the event differentially affects the negative emotions generated by the service failure and results in racially driven differences in the amount of remuneration perceived as necessary to successfully recover from the failure. The implication is that when serving customers, the race of both the customer and other customers can provide service providers with information relative to the appropriate service recovery effort to implement.									23	0	0	0	0	23			0092-0703			WOS:000262765800007		
J	Mahmoodi, S. Nima; Jalili, Nader								Coupled Flexural-Torsional Nonlinear Vibrations of Piezoelectrically Actuated Microcantilevers With Application to Friction Force Microscopy								JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND ACOUSTICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME				130	6					061003	10.1115/1.2948379			DEC 2008	2008	The problem of vibrations of microcantilevers has recently received considerable attention due to its application in several nanotechnological instruments, such as atomic force microscopy, nanomechanical cantilever sensors, and friction force microscopy. Along this line, this paper undertakes the problem of coupled flexural-torsional nonlinear vibrations of a piezoelectrically actuated microcantilever beam as a typical configuration utilized in these applications. The actuation and sensing are both facilitated through bonding a piezoelectric layer (here, ZnO) on the microcantilever surface. The beam is considered to have simultaneous flexural, torsional, and longitudinal vibrations. The piezoelectric properties combined with nonlinear geometry of the beam introduce both linear and nonlinear couplings between flexural vibration as well as longitudinal and torsional vibrations. Of particular interest is the inextensibility configuration, for which the governing equations reduce to coupled flexural-torsional nonlinear equations with piezoelectric nonlinearity appearing in quadratic form while inertia and stiffness nonlinearities as cubic. An experimental setup consisting of a commercial piezoelectric microcantilever installed on the stand of an ultramodern laser-based microsystem analyzer is designed and utilized to verify the theoretical developments. Both linear and nonlinear simulation results are compared to the experimental results and it is observed that nonlinear modeling response matches the experimental findings very closely. More specifically, the softening phenomenon in fundamental flexural frequency, which is due to nonlinearity of the system, is analytically and experimentally verified. It is also disclosed that the initial twisting in the microcantilever can influence the value of the flexural vibration resonance. The experimental results from a macroscale beam are utilized to demonstrate such twist-flexure coupling. This unique coupling effect may lead to the possibility of indirect measurement of small torsional vibration without the need for any angular displacement sensor. This observation could significantly extend the application of friction force microscopy to measure the friction of a surface indirectly.									11	0	0	1	0	11			1048-9002			WOS:000260310300003

A control framework: Insights from evidence on lean accounting								MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING RESEARCH				19	4	SI		301	323		10.1016/j.mar.2008.01.001			DEC 2008	2008	Lean manufacturing is a complete business system that combines advanced manufacturing techniques including just-in-time (JIT), total quality management (TQM), and total preventative maintenance (TPM). We investigate (tie control framework that results from a lean manufacturing strategic initiative. Our setting is the natural environment of a lean manufacturing firm which also implemented lean accounting and control practices. Lean accounting seeks to reduce steps in transaction processing, eliminate standard costs in favor of actual costs, and discontinue cost allocations; while lean control practices re-focus the performance measurement system and emphasize social and behavioral controls. In this case study we develop a theoretical framework that assists in understanding the control choices, accounting practices, and organizational structure associated with lean manufacturing. Within the control framework, we identify numerous intervening and bidirectional relations. We contrast our theoretical framework with prior research and discuss empirical implications.

J	Becht, Gregory A.; Vaughey, John T.; Britt, Robin L.; Eagle, Cassandra T.; Hwu, Shiou-Jyh					Vaughey, John/0000-0002-2556-6129			Ion exchange and electrochemical evaluation of the microporous phosphate Li(9)Fe(7)(PO(4))(10)								MATERIALS RESEARCH BULLETIN				43	12			3389	3396		10.1016/j.materresbull.2008.02.005			DEC 1 2008	2008	A new lithium iron(III) phosphate, Li(9)Fe(7)(PO(4))(10), has been synthesized and is currently under electrochemical evaluation as an anode material for rechargeable lithium-ion battery applications. The sample was prepared via the ion exchange reaction of Cs(5)K(4)Fe(7)(PO(4))(10) 1 in the 1 M LiNO(3) solution under hydrothermal conditions at 200 degrees C. The fully Li(+)-exchanged sample Li(9)Fe(7)(PO(4))(10) 2 cannot yet be synthesized by conventional high-temperature, solid-state methods. The parent compound 1 is a member of the Cs(9-x)K(x)Fe(7)(PO(4))(10) series that was previously isolated from a high-temperature (750 degrees C) reaction employing the eutectic CsCl/KCl molten salt. The polycrystalline solid 1 was first prepared in a stoichiometric reaction via conventional solid-state method then followed by ion exchange giving rise to 2. Both compounds adopt three-dimensional structures that consist of orthogonally interconnected channels where electropositive ions reside. It has been demonstrated that the Cs(9-x)K(x)Fe(7)(PO(4))(10) series possesses versatile ion exchange capabilities with all the monovalent alkali metal and silver cations due to its facile pathways for ion transport. I and 2 Were Subject to electrochemical analysis and preliminary results suggest that the latter can be considered as an anode material. Electrochemical results indicate that Li(9)Fe(7)(PO(4))(10) is reduced below 1 V (vs. Li) to most likely form a Fe(0)/Li(3)PO(4) composite material, which can Subsequently be cycled reversibly at relatively low potential. An initial capacity of 250 mAh/g was measured, which is equivalent to the insertion of thirteen Li atoms per Li(9+x)Fe(7)(PO(4))(10) (x= 13) during the charge/discharge process (Fe(2+) + 2e -> Fe(0)). Furthermore, 2 shows a lower reduction potential (0.9 V), by approximately 200 mV, and much better electrochemical reversibility than iron(III) phosphate, FePO(4), highlighting the value of improving the ionic conductivity of the sample.

J	Saeidpourazar, Reza; Jalili, Nader								Towards fused vision and force robust feedback control of nanorobotic-based manipulation and grasping								MECHATRONICS				18	10			566	577		10.1016/j.mechatronics.2008.05.014			DEC 2008	2008	This paper presents the design and development of a fused vision force feedback robust controller for a nanomanipulator used in nanofiber grasping and nano-fabric production applications. The RRP (revolute revolute prismatic) nanomanipulator considered here utilizes two rotational motors with 0.1 mu rad resolution and one linear Nanomotor(R) with 0.25 nm resolution. The nanomanipulator is capable of achieving well-behaved kinematic and backlash-free characteristics in addition to atomic scale precision to guarantee accurate manipulation at the nanoscale. A mathematical model of the nanomanipulator is formulated, along with direct and inverse kinematics and dynamic equations of the system. Unlike typical macroscale manipulator models and controllers, the controller development is not trivial due to nanoscale movement and forces, coupled with unmodeled dynamics, nonlinear structural dynamics and mainly the lack of position and velocity feedbacks in this particular nanomanipulator. Utilizing pure vision feedback to acquire nanomanipulator's tip position is shown to have limited capabilities in achieving the desired control accuracy. To remedy this, a controlled fusion of visual servoing and force feedbacks for nanomanipulator positioning is proposed and analyzed extensively. Following the development of the controller, numerical simulations with generic feedback using a realistic scenario with fused vision and force feedbacks are presented to demonstrate the positioning performance capability in the nano manipulation applications considered here.

The surface heterogeneities may be symmetrically or asymmetrically distributed parallel or perpendicular to the flow axis. Both streaming effects are modified by the flow rate through the heterogeneous channel, to eliminate the possible influence of electrokinetic flow on the streaming potential and streaming current measurements. Although they are still dependent on the distribution of surface heterogeneity, the flow rate-modified streaming effects are demonstrated to provide more consistent results with the traditional linear assumption than do the traditional ones, especially apparent in small microchannels.									5	1	0	1	0	6			1613-4982			WOS:000260184500004		
J	Leap, Terry								When bad people rise to the top								MIT SLOAN MANAGEMENT REVIEW				49	2			23	+					WIN 2008	2008	Observers are often amazed when executives with impressive track records are mysteriously transformed into corrupt and tyrannical monsters once they become chief executive officers. In truth, these executives often had serious character flaws that were either hidden or ignored for years. Corporate boards and search committees are not likely to detect personality problems of promising CEO candidates simply by examining their resumes or by conducting standard job interviews. This raises the question of how corporate boards or CEO search committees can penetrate the facade of an upwardly mobile executive who is, in reality, a wolf in sheep's clothing.What danger signals do these individuals exhibit and what measures can be taken to reduce the likelihood of hiring a dysfunctional CEO? The author identifies eight potential danger signals including: an obsession with acquiring prestige, power, and wealth; a proclivity for developing grandiose strategies with little thought toward their implementation; and a fondness for a data-driven management style that overshadows or ignores a broader vision. Even sterling CEOs occasionally exhibit one or more of the danger signals described here. Potentially bad CEOs, however, usually possess several of these characteristics, and they exhibit them repeatedly.There is no ideal method for selecting a CEO, and there may be no executive position that provides a true test of a person's fitness to assume the top job, but there are several ways that a company can limit its risks when deciding on a CEO. Boards are usually cautious when looking at CEO candidates from outside the organization. They are more likely to be lulled into a sense of complacency, however, when considering an internal candidate. Some suggestions for screening prospective CEOs include disregarding the time-tested rule that past success is a predictor of future success, performing a thorough background check that focuses on a candidate's integrity and interpersonal skills and using experience-based interviews to test CEO finalists.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1532-9194			WOS:000252335500012

Given a long procurement lead time, the supplier must choose the orders to Pursue and the total quantity to procure prior to the selling season. We model this as a selective newsvendor problem of maximizing profits where the total (random) demand is given by the set of pursued orders. Given that the dimensionality of a mixed-integer linear pro.-ramming formulation of the problem increases exponentially with the number of potential orders, we develop both a tailored exact algorithm based on the L-shaped method for two-stage stochastic programming as well as a heuristic method. We also extend Our solution approach to account for piecewise-linear cost and revenue functions as well as a multiperiod setting. Extensive experimentation indicates that our exact approach rapidly finds optimal solutions with three times as many orders as a state-of-the-art commercial solver. In addition, Our heuristic approach provides average gaps of less than 1% for the largest problems that can be solved exactly. Observing that the gaps decrease as problem size grows, we expect the heuristic approach to work well for large problem instances. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J	Zhou, Yi; Omar, Mohammed								Dynamic-template processing for passive thermograms: Applied to automotive stamping split detection								NDT & E INTERNATIONAL				41	8			582	588		10.1016/j.ndteint.2008.07.002			DEC 2008	2008	This manuscript introduces a passive thermal-vision modality to detect splits and tears in automotive stampings in real time. This system scans 3D temperature maps of high reflective steel panels, with complex geometry in addition to the drawing die, to locate abnormal temperature readings indicative of high local wrinkling pressure (cause of metal splitting). Preprocessing utilizes a coefficient-correction Map to account for the emissivity dependency on part geometries, and the stamping-die changing the thermal profile. Also, a pattern-matching algorithm is used to synchronize the thermal analysis with the die location (stamping pace) through a new concept of matching thermal histograms. A new image-processing routine named "dynamic-template" is developed to retrieve the split's shape and identify its location. The template is Computed through a region of interest (ROI) approach with a dynamic threshold, while accounting for spatial deviations (mainly press-fine vibration). The developed hardware and software are implemented oil all automotive press-line, and the real-time thermal acquisition is processed to illustrate the system performance and success; different split shapes and sizes are detected under actual operating conditions.

However, the mechanism behind this activity remains unknown. In the present study, we Studied the anti-tumor activity of fermented Noni exudate (fNE) and demonstrated that intraperitoneal injection of this material significantly increased the percentages of granulocytes and NK cells in the peripheral blood, peritoneum, and spleen. Furthermore, in preventive and treatment settings, fNE injection induced complete tumor I-ejection in normal C57BL/6J mice, partial tumor rejection in C57 nude mice lacking functional lymphocytes, and no tumor rejection in NK cell deficient beige mice. Over 85% of the C57BL/6J mice that received fNE survived the first tumor injection and rejected up to 5 x 10(6) tumor cells when re-challenged. The anti-tumor activity remains in the heat-inactivated and filtrated Supernatant of fNE. These data demonstrate that fNE appears to be able to stimulate the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system to reject tumor cells. NK cells respond quickly and appear to be among the major players of the innate immune system, while the adaptive immune system reacts later with a retained memory.									7	5	0	4	1	13			1021-335X			WOS:000261293300029	19020734

The full theory captures both the static and the dynamic effects of the fermions on the generic superfluid-insulator phase diagram. We find that, in a homogenous system described by a single-band boson Hubbard Hamiltonian, the intrinsic perturbative effect of the fermions is to generically suppress the insulating lobes and to enhance the superfluid phase.									11	0	0	0	0	11			1098-0121			WOS:000262245200010

It is found that a 7 T magnetic field applied along the c axis causes a small but finite enhancement of the spin-order peak intensity and has no observable effect on the peak width. Inelastic neutron-scattering measurements indicate that the low-energy magnetic excitations are not affected by the field, within experimental error. In particular, the small energy gap that was recently reported is still present at low temperature in the applied field. In addition, we find that the spin-correlation length along the antiferromagnetic stripes is greater than that perpendicular to them.									21	0	0	0	0	21			1098-0121			WOS:000262244400020

Homosexuality has become a frontline issue in American politics, as illustrated most recently by gay marriage battles in the courts and state legislatures as well as state referenda campaigns designed to define marriage legally as the union of a man and a woman. Using survey data from a national random sample of 3,208 clergy who serve in six mainline Protestant denominations, we analyze the extent to which gender operates as a significant predictor of public speech on gay rights issues. Ordinal logistic regression allows us to demonstrate that women clergy are substantially more likely than their male counterparts to speak publicly on gay rights, as well as to model more generally the factors that compel clergy to take action to address this controversial issue in public.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1755-0483	1755-0491		WOS:000270262000002

The effects of the universal intervention were evaluated within the context of a design in which two cohorts of students at 37 schools from four sites (N=5,581) were randomized to four conditions: (a) a universal intervention that involved implementing a student curriculum and teacher training with sixth grade students and teachers; (b) a selective intervention in which a family intervention was implemented with a subset of sixth grade students exhibiting high levels of aggression and social influence; (c) a combined intervention condition; and (d) a no-intervention control condition. Short-term and long-term (i.e., 2-year post-intervention) universal intervention effects on social-cognitive factors targeted by the intervention varied as a function of students' pre-intervention level of risk. High-risk students benefited from the intervention in terms of decreases in beliefs and attitudes supporting aggression, and increases in self-efficacy, beliefs and attitudes supporting nonviolent behavior. Effects on low-risk students were in the opposite direction. The differential pattern of intervention effects for low- and high-risk students may account for the absence of main effects in many previous evaluations of universal interventions for middle school youth. These findings have important research and policy implications for efforts to develop effective violence prevention programs.									37	0	0	3	1	38			1389-4986			WOS:000260666100001

Experimental studies of air/water transport typically require a method for cleaning the air/water interface so that it is free from any contaminating surfactant monolayer. This may be for the sake of running an experiment under clean surface conditions, or to clean the surface prior to deposition of a known surfactant. Herein a method is described for maintaining a clean air/water interface during conditions of finite air flow over the water surface. The unique aspect of this method is its ability to maintain clean surfaces while experiments are conducted.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0034-6748	1089-7623		WOS:000262224800041	19123579

Variations in entrepreneurship								SMALL BUSINESS ECONOMICS				31	4			351	361		10.1007/s11187-008-9139-5			DEC 2008	2008	This article is written in the style of a "bildungsroman," a fictional autobiographical "coming of age story" about the author's experiences of his beginning to recognize the: great diversity of entrepreneurs, many types of startup firms, multiple ways entrepreneurs go about starting firms, and innumerable situations in which entrepreneurial activity takes place. In this remembrance of things past, the author realizes: the phenomenological underpinnings of his understanding of entrepreneurship, his belief in the primacy of facts as the arbiter of theory, that his theory predisposed him to look only for certain kinds of facts and ignore others which then makes theory paradoxically the arbiter of the facts found, and, finally, that knowledge is hard won and wisdom elusive.									19	0	0	0	0	19			0921-898X	1573-0913		WOS:000260380000002

CPTU SIMPLIFIED STRESS-BASED MODEL FOR EVALUATING SOIL LIQUEFACTION POTENTIAL								SOILS AND FOUNDATIONS				48	6			755	770		10.3208/sandf.48.755			DEC 2008	2008	This paper presents a piezocone penetration test (CPTu) method for evaluating soil liquefaction potential covering a wider range of soil types than previous approaches and using simplified stress-based procedures. In the approach, the adjusted cyclic stress ratio is calculated with a recent formula created by Idriss and Boulanger, and the cyclic resistance ratio is determined as a function of both adjusted cone tip resistance (q(uN)) and soil behavior type index (I(c)). The new method is established through artificial neural network learning of documented cases. One unique feature of this method is the inclusion of excess porewater pressure ratio (B(q)) in the formulation of Ic as per Jefferies and Davies. The proposed method is shown to be more applicable to a wider range of soils, including geomaterials that were previously considered "too clay-rich to liquefy." The ability of this method to delineate liquefied cases from non-liquefied cases is clearly depicted with 3-D and 2-D graphs. Case studies of selected ground failure sites in Adapazari using the proposed method yield results that agree well with field observations in the 1999 Kocaeli earthquake.									7	0	0	2	0	8			0038-0806			WOS:000264040900002

The strategic issue literature broadly labels opportunities as being positive and controllable and involving potential gain. We demonstrate that this is similar to an attribution theory approach. In preparing this article, the authors analyzed open-ended questions from the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED). Entrepreneurs were more likely to offer attributions about their opportunities that can be categorized as dependent on their abilities (internal and stable attributions) and efforts (internal and variable attributions).

The forecasting of International Expo tourism using quantitative and qualitative techniques								TOURISM MANAGEMENT				29	6			1084	1098		10.1016/j.tourman.2008.02.007			DEC 2008	2008	This study predicts the number of visitors to an international tourism Expo to be held in Korea in 2012, an unprecedented event for the host city. Forecasting demand for such a mega-event has received only limited attention in the literature. Unlike most studies forecasting international tourism demand, forecasting Expo demand involves using both quantitative forecasting models and qualitative technique because of data limitations. Combining quantitative techniques with willingness-to-visit (WTV) surveys predicts the Expo demand at 8.9 million visitors. In comparison using the Delphi method, experts predict Expo demand at 6.8 million visitors. For this study, the Delphi method provides more conservative estimates than estimates from combining quantitative techniques with WTV. Policy implications presented are directed toward Expo planners and practitioners in terms of demand and supply side, application of these results in the decision-making process, and future challenges surrounding demand forecasting.

It is reported here that small carbon nanoparticles doped with inorganic salts serve as a highly promising new platform for brightly photoluminescent dots. The photoluminescent carbon dots with the carbon core doped with ZnO (C(ZnO)-Dots) or ZnS (C(ZnS)-Dots) in aqueous solutions are competitive to the commercially available CdSe/ZnS QDs in luminescence brightness.									149	13	0	24	0	159			1932-7447			WOS:000261056500003	19606263

The lowest filtration rates were observed at lowest temperatures and POC concentrations while the highest rates were at intermediate temperatures and the highest POC levels. The predicted filtration rate (PFR) in response to water temperature and POC concentrations was as follows: ln PFR=1.4352+0.1192 POC+0.1399 T-0.0001 T(3). Within the experimental conditions, PFRs at any POC concentration increased with increased water temperature to a peak at 22 degrees C and then decreased. The maximum PFR occurred at 22 degrees C and 32 mg C L(-1) and the minimum PFR at 7 degrees C and 1 mg C L(-1). A model to describe the mussel filtration rate responses to PAS water conditions involves both water temperature and POC concentration.									1	0	0	2	0	2			1355-557X			WOS:000261132800001

DWM07 depends on the following three parameters: magnetic latitude, magnetic local time, and the 3-h Kp geomagnetic activity index. The latitude and local time dependences are represented by vector spherical harmonic functions ( up to degree 10 in latitude and order 3 in local time), and the Kp dependence is represented by quadratic B-splines. DWM07 is the storm time thermospheric component of the new Horizontal Wind Model (HWM07), which is described in a companion paper. DWM07 is based on data from the Wind Imaging Interferometer on board the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite, the Wind and Temperature Spectrometer on board Dynamics Explorer 2, and seven ground-based Fabry-Perot interferometers. The perturbation winds derived from the three data sets are in good mutual agreement under most conditions, and the model captures most of the climatological variations evident in the data.									42	2	1	0	0	45			0148-0227			WOS:000261247500003

The exposure-induced modification on the glass film's surface profile, refractive index, and structural properties were shown to be a function of laser irradiance, the number of laser pulses per focal spot, and repetition rate. Film response was shown to be related to deposition technique-related density and the number of glass bonds within the irradiated focal volume.

Metal Ion Reactive Thin Films Using Spray Electrostatic LbL Assembly								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY B				112	46			14453	14460		10.1021/jp8028853			NOV 20 2008	2008	By using the spray-layer-by-layer (Spray-LbL) technique, the number of metal counterions trapped within LbL coatings is significantly increased by kinetically freezing the film short of equilibrium, potentially limiting interchain penetration and forcing chains to remain extrinsically compensated to a much greater degree than observed in the traditional dipped LbL technique. The basis for the enhanced entrapment of metal ions such as Cu2+, Fe2+, and Ag+ is addressed, including the equilibrium driving force for extrinsic compensation by soft versus hard metal ions and the impact of Spray-LbL on the kinetics of polymer-ion complexation. These polymer-bound metal-ion coatings are also demonstrated to be effective treatments for air filtration, functionalizing existing filters with the ability to strongly bind toxic industrial compounds such as ammonia or cyanide gases, as well as chemical warfare agent simulants such as chloroethyl ethyl sulfide. On the basis of results reported here, future work could extend this method to include other toxic soft-base ligands such as carbon monoxide, benzene, or organophosphate nerve agents.									16	0	0	0	0	16			1520-6106			WOS:000260923400015	18712910

Toluene was chosen as a model compound to represent tars. The effects of addition of each gasification gas component on the activities of WC and WZ for NH3 and toluene decomposition were investigated. The NH3 and toluene decomposition reactions were conducted at typical hot gas cleanup conditions of 700 degrees C and 1 atm. In the absence of gasification gases. low activities were observed for toluene decomposition on WC and WZ while complete conversion of 4000 ppm of NH3 was observed at space velocities of 5 800 000 and 385 000 h(-1) for WC and WZ, respectively. The presence of H-2 CO, CO2, and H2O had a somewhat negative impact on the high activities of WC and WZ for NH3 decomposition while it had a positive impact on the toluene decomposition activities of both the catalysts. However, both WC and WZ were active for the simultaneous removal of NH3 and toluene in the presence of H-2 CO, CO2, and H2O. In the presence of gasification gases, both WC and WZ showed comparable performances for toluene decomposition on a "per-g-catalyst" basis with that of a commercial ultrastable Y zeolite (USY). However, on a "per-m(2)-catalyst" basis, WC showed by far the highest activity.									5	0	0	1	0	5			0888-5885			WOS:000260889000013

Results show that the EDL structure will alter the voltammetric current response of nano-IDEs due to the expansion of the diffuse layer into the diffusion layer at the electrode surfaces and the overlap of the electrical fields of the neighboring electrodes. The EDL induced change in the voltammetric current response is more severe for nano-IDEs with a smaller electrode size and gap spacing, and the EDL effect is influenced by the compact layer thickness, the charge valence of the redox species, the electron transfer rate, and the absence of the supporting electrolyte.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0957-4484			WOS:000260264000016	21836247

Both the rovibrational and translational energies of sputtered deuterium molecules are found to be close to 1 eV over the whole impact energy range, with approximate equipartition between rotational and vibrational modes, particularly at the higher impact energies. Sputtered carbon-containing molecules are vibrationally energetic, with rovibrational energies in the range of 1.5-2.5 eV; translational and rotational motions are less energetic, close to 0.5 eV, but hotter, with more energy per degree of freedom. The energy distributions of ejected molecules confirm the partial thermalization of the impact cascade. We also study the angular spectrum of the velocity of the outgoing particles as well as their angular momentum. While the velocity vectors are described well by a cosine distribution, a preferred direction of rotation is found at the lowest energies, with the angular momenta preferentially oriented parallel to the surface.									12	0	0	0	0	12			0021-8979			WOS:000262605800026

Modeling of multifilament PET fiber melt-spinning								JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE				110	4			2153	2163		10.1002/app.28827			NOV 15 2008	2008	A fundamental issue in the polymer fiber melt-spinning process is the control of final properties. Most available melt-spinning models simulate only a single fiber, providing an incomplete representation of the actual industrial multifilament process. Variations across the fiber bundle in cooling air velocity and temperature result in nonuniformity in fiber properties. Simulation can provide insight into this cause-and-effect relationship and lead to better process design to control differences between fibers. The few multifilament models in existence typically use a Newtonian constitutive model for the polymer, failing to capture nonlinear effects which often play a significant role in the process. Experimental validation of multifilament simulation is lacking. We present a nonisothermal multifilament spinning model, applicable for a variety of polymer and process conditions. The model combines the flow-enhanced crystallization (FEC) fiber spinning model of McHugh et al. with a generalization of Dutta's multifilament model. The model predicts fiber properties such as stress, degree of crystallinity, fiber radius and temperature as a function of distance from the spinneret, along with quench air cross velocity and temperature throughout the fiber bundle region. The McHugh FEC model for single fiber spinning, based on a modified Giesekus constitutive model and Avrami-type crystallization kinetics, has been experimentally validated. In this work we show that results of the multifilament quench air model compare favorably to experimental measurements.(C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.									8	1	0	0	0	9			0021-8995			WOS:000259755300033		
J	Lohitharn, Nattaporn; Goodwin, James G., Jr.								Effect of K promotion of Fe and FeMn Fischer-Tropsch synthesis catalysts: Analysis at the site level using SSITKA								JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS				260	1			7	16		10.1016/j.jcat.2008.08.011			NOV 15 2008	2008	Promoting a precipitated FeCuSiO(2) catalyst with Mn has been shown to significantly improve its catalytic activity for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (M). Although the impact of K promotion on the activity of Fe catalysts with and without Mn addition has been studied previously, no one has previously delineated how K influences the concentration of active surface intermediates and the intrinsic site activities of Fe and, more specifically, Mn-promoted Fe catalysts. This paper addresses that issue using steady-state isotopic transient kinetic analysis (SSITKA). Adding K at relatively low concentrations to the base Fe and Mn-promoted Fe catalysts improved the catalyst activity, but the activity of the catalysts declined with the addition of an excess amount. The percentage of light olefins (C(2)-C(4) fraction) and chain growth probability (a) were enhanced, as expected with the presence of K, regardless of Mn addition. The addition of K decreased the BET surface area and the concentration of surface exposed Fen atoms (as determined by CO chemisorption). The intrinsic site activities (TOF(ITK)) of all of the Fe catalysts determined using SSITKA were essentially identical, regardless of the concentration of added K or Mn promotion. This indicates that adding K to unpromoted or Mn-promoted Fe catalysts did not greatly affect the activity of the active sites. Rather, the higher catalyst Activities observed for the Fe and Mn-promoted Fe catalysts with K addition were due primarily to an increase in the number of active surface intermediates leading to hydrocarbon products.

As experimentalists we often manipulate stimuli in a controlled setting or compare species to observe the degree of variation in movement and motor control of particular behaviors. Understanding and communicating the biological significance of these sources of variability requires a universal terminology that is presently lacking in the functional morphology literature. We suggest that 'stereotypy' be used to refer to the degree of variability observed in a behavior across trials under a given set of conditions. The ability of an organism to alter its behavior across experimental treatments is referred to as 'flexibility'. We discuss how there has been a tendency to confound the phenomenon of a behavior exhibiting low variability, which we refer to as stereotyped, with inflexibility, or the inability to alter the behavior in response to a change in stimulus. The degree of stereotypy and flexibility in a behavior need not be correlated, nor need they have a common underlying basis. Coordination, a term used to describe the relationship between different body parts during movement, can be stereotyped and can show flexibility. Stereotypy of coordination can be assessed by the strength of correlations between movements of two body parts. The influence of coordination coherence on behavioral performance has rarely been considered, and could shed light on how taxa differ in their ability to perform behaviors. We suggest definitions of the terms stereotypy, flexibility and coordination, and provide examples of how and when these terms could be used when discussing behavioral changes in functional morphology.									36	1	0	35	0	36			0022-0949			WOS:000260540700006	18978215

Surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization was used to graft poly(2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (poly(DMAEMA)) nanolayers from the pore surfaces of commercially available regenerated cellulose membranes. Initial measurements were made to determine the thickness evolution of the poly(DMAEMA) nanolayers, using a model flat substrate designed to mimic the three-dimensional nature of initiator incorporation into the membrane. Thereafter, polymerization time was used as the independent variable to control the mass of polymer grafted from the membrane surfaces and, thus, the protein binding capacity. ATR-FTIR, AFM, and SEM were used to characterize changes in the chemical functionality, surface topography, and pore morphology of membranes as a result of modification. Bovine serum albumin was used to evaluate the static protein binding capacity of poly(DMAEMA)-modified membranes. Maximum static binding capacities increased with increasing polymerization time in a linear fashion for short polymerization times (<6h). For longer polymerization times, capacity increased non-linearly, eventually reaching a plateau value of 66.3 mg/mL. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The results show that the threshold criteria developed by Iwasaki and his co-workers for interpreting the calculated LPI are not universally applicable. To the contrary, the LPI must be re-calibrated when any component model of the LPI framework is replaced with a new model. The new CPTU model is a significant advance in the cone penetration-based liquefaction evaluation; in fact, it is the first simplified model that explicitly incorporates pore pressure measurement as one of its input parameters. This CPTU model is applicable to a wide range of soil types and thusly enables a more convenient and effective modeling of liquefaction effects within the LPI framework. Probabilistic characterization of the new CM model is carried out. Finally, the results of the calibration of the LPI calculated with this CPTU model, along with the concept of the probability of surface manifestations, are presented and discussed.

The influence of oleylamine in the nanocrystal synthesis and core-shell formation through an anion-exchange mechanism was also studied. The simple cubic super crystals together with two-dimensional assembly patterns containing PbTe nanocubes and their core-shell building blocks were examined using TEM, SEM, AFM, XRD, SAXS, and FTIR. Such super crystals consisting of cubic structural building blocks may allow engineering of more complex materials from which novel properties may emerge.									61	0	0	5	0	61			0002-7863			WOS:000260682300063	18937469

Silicon optical fiber								OPTICS EXPRESS				16	23			18675	18683		10.1364/OE.16.018675			NOV 10 2008	2008	Described herein are initial experimental details and properties of a silicon core, silica glass-clad optical fiber fabricated using conventional optical fiber draw methods. Such semiconductor core fibers have potential to greatly influence the fields of nonlinear fiber optics, infrared and THz power delivery. More specifically, x-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy showed the core to be highly crystalline silicon. The measured propagation losses were 4.3 dB/m at 2.936 mu m, which likely are caused by either microcracks in the core arising from the large thermal expansion mismatch with the cladding or to SiO2 precipitates formed from oxygen dissolved in the silicon melt. Suggestions for enhancing the performance of these semiconductor core fibers are provided. Here we show that lengths of an optical fiber containing a highly crystalline semiconducting core can be produced using scalable fiber fabrication techniques.

In this study, 11 major compounds were identified from the acetic ether extract of leaves of the fragrance flower loquat. These chemicals are (1) 2 alpha, 19 alpha-dihydroxy-3-oxo-urs-12-en-28-oic acid, (2) 2 alpha-hydroxyursolic acid, (3) ursolic acid, (4) 2 alpha-hydroxyoleanolic acid, (5) tormentic acid, (6) beta-daucosterol, (7) epicatechin, (8) cinchonain la (9), cinchonain Ib, (10) quercetin-3-O-alpha-L-rhamnoside and (11) arbutin. Meanwhile, the antioxidant activities of these compounds were evaluated by the DPPH and FRAP assays. Cinchonain Ib exhibited the highest antioxidant activity, followed by cinchonain la, epicatechin, quercetin-3-O-alpha-L-rhamnoside and arbutin.

Using UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy, we have shown that Cu2O nanoparticles can be generated by controlling the aging of the sol prior to film deposition while the Cu-0 nanoparticles can be synthesized using a heat treatment in H-2 atmosphere at 550 degrees C for 6 h. It has been also demonstrated that irradiation with an UV pulsed (Q-switched Nd:YAG) or continuous black ray UV lamp can dissolve these Cu-based nanoparticles with controlled, spatial selectivity. The mechanism of the dissolution process was found to be mainly thermal. Finally, we report a new analytical technique for detecting/confirming the presence of low densities of Cu nanoparticles in the films, based on a relative heat flow measurement of such films using a micro-thermal analyzer (e.g., TA Instruments mu TA model 2990).

Microbial Recovery from Genetically Featherless Broiler Carcasses after Forced Cloacal Fecal Expulsion								POULTRY SCIENCE				87	11			2377	2381		10.3382/ps.2007-00426			NOV 2008	2008	A study was conducted to determine external microbiology of genetically featherless broiler carcasses after forced cloacal fecal expulsion. Full-fed featherless broilers were placed into coops, transported, unloaded, shackled, stunned, suffocated, weighed, and divided into 3 treatments groups. Carcasses were transferred to a separate shackle line and passed through a machine designed to induce defecation (squeeze) and then remove external feces (wash). Treatments were obtained by turning the squeezing and washing components on or off. Treatments were as follows: S carcasses were squeezed but not washed; W carcasses were not squeezed but were washed; and SW carcasses were squeezed and washed. Concentrations of total aerobic microorganisms (AB), Escherichia coli (EC), coliforms (CF), and Campylobacter (CPY) recovered from whole carcass rinses did not vary with treatment (P > 0.05). However, counts of Salmonella (SAL) in rinses of S carcasses were 1.4 log(10) cfu/mL greater than counts of SAL found in rinses of SW carcasses (P < 0.05). The SAL prevalence was similar for S (86% positive), W (90% positive), and SW (83% positive) carcasses (P > 0.05). Populations of AB and CF recovered from wash water (water applied in the machine after fecal expulsion) for SW carcasses were significantly higher by 3.1 and 1.5 log(10) cfu/mL, respectively, than the populations of the same bacteria recovered from wash water for W carcasses (P < 0.05). Levels of EC and CPY recovered from wash water did not vary with treatment. There was no difference in CPY and SAL prevalence in water collected after washing W carcasses or SW carcasses (P > 0.05). Data from the present study show that controlled cloacal fecal expulsion followed by carcass washing immediately after slaughter can be used to minimize the numbers of carcass Salmonella and can reduce the likelihood of visible carcass fecal contamination or cross-contamination to other carcasses and processing equipment.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0032-5791			WOS:000260519700026	18931190

These nanopartices exhibit small particle diameters, extraordinary fluorescence brightness, and excellent photostability. Single particle fluorescence imaging and kinetic studies indicate much higher emission rates (similar to 10(8) s(-1)) and little or no blinking of the nanoparticles as compared to typical results for single dye molecules and quantum dots. Analysis of single particle photobleaching trajectories reveals excellent photostability-as many as 10(9) or more photons emitted per nanoparticle prior to irreversible photobleaching. The superior figures of merit of these new fluorescent probes, together with the demonstration of cellular imaging, indicate their enormous potential for demanding fluorescence-based imaging and sensing applications such as high speed super-resolution single molecule/particle tracking and highly sensitive assays.									351	12	0	58	0	357			1936-0851			WOS:000261199400030	19206410

The article builds upon the elements of success as identified in the lead article of this volume, which include items relevant to the family, the individual, and the broader community context. The authors add the following to those success factors: (1) ignorance (or disregard) of the barriers to success and the odds against overcoming them; (2) emotionally motivated responses to the surrounding social conditions or to specific (cathartic) events; and (3) exiting underprivileged neighborhoods of origin to facilitate access to resources, mainly educational.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0002-7162			WOS:000260057700008

REFLECTANCE-BASED SENSOR TO PREDICT VISUAL QUALITY RATINGS OF TURFGRASS PLOTS								APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE				24	6			855	860					NOV 2008	2008	Turfgrass quality is visually evaluated by human assessors based on a settle of 1 to 9. This evaluation practice is subjective and does not provide accurate and reproducible measure of the turf quality. The aim of this research was to design a portable optical sensor to predict the quality ratings of turfgrass research plots from spectral reflectance. Reflectance data were collected using a dual spectroradiometer covering a spectrum of 350-1050 nm front bermudagrass and bluegrass research plots. Two different regression methods, Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), were used and compared. Two wavelength bands centered at 680 nm (Red) and 780 nm (NIR) were identified since these bands carry useful information in the prediction of turfgrass visual quality The average Standard Error of Cross Validation (SECV) was found to be about 0.76 and 0.88 by using the model with Red and NIR bands for bermudagrass and bluegrass data sets, respectively. A simple prototype sensor using the two identified bands was fabricated and tested. The prototype sensor predicted the visual quality ratings as well as the spectroradiometer with a SECV of about 0.57 using two bands.									7	0	0	7	0	7			0883-8542			WOS:000261937800016

However, no spectroscopic redshift for this burst is known. We report on our ground-based optical/NIR and millimeter follow-up observations of this event at several observatories, including the multi-channel imager GROND on La Silla, supplemented by Swift UVOT and Swift XRT data. The spectral energy distribution ( SED) of the optical/NIR afterglow is found to decline sharply bluewards to the UV bands, which can be utilized in estimating the redshift. Fitting the SED from the Swift UVOT uvw2 band to the H band, we estimate a photometric redshift of z = 1.8(-0.3)(+0.4), which is consistent with the reported pseudo-redshift based on gamma-ray data. We find that the afterglow properties of GRB 080514B do not differ from those exhibited by the global sample of long bursts. Compared with the long burst sample, we conclude that this burst was special because of its high-energy emission properties, even though both its afterglow and host galaxy are not remarkable in any way. Obviously, high-energy emission in the gamma-ray band does not automatically correlate with the occurrence of special features in the corresponding afterglow light.									15	0	0	0	0	15			0004-6361			WOS:000260761100008

GRB 061126 was a long burst (T(90) = 191 s) with four overlapping peaks in its gamma-ray light curve. The X-ray afterglow, observed from 26 minutes to 20 days after the burst, shows a simple power-law decay with alpha(x) 1: 290 +/- 0:008. Optical observations presented here cover the time range from 258 s (Faulkes Telescope North) to 15 days ( Gemini North) after the burst; the decay rate of the optical afterglow shows a steep-to-shallow transition (from alpha(1) - 1.48 +/- 0:06 to alpha(2) - 0:88 +/- 0:03) approximately 13 minutes after the burst. We suggest the early, steep component is due to a reverse shock and show that the magnetic energy density in the ejecta, expressed as a fraction of the equipartition value, is a few 10 times larger than in the forward shock in the early afterglow phase. The ejecta might be endowed with primordial magnetic fields at the central engine. The optical light curve implies a late-time break at about 1.5 days after the burst, while there is no evidence of the simultaneous break in the X-ray light curve. We model the broadband emission and show that some afterglow characteristics (the steeper decay in X-ray and the shallow spectral index from optical to X-ray) are difficult to explain in the framework of the standard fireball model. This might imply that the X-ray afterglow is due to an additional emission process, such as late-time central engine activity rather than blast-wave shock emission. The possible chromatic break at 1.5 days after the burst would give support to the additional emission scenario.									48	1	0	1	0	48			0004-637X			WOS:000260370800034

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have demonstrated gastric acid,suppression superior to that of histamine H(2)-receptor blockers. PPIs have enabled improved treatment of various acid-peptic disorders, including gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcer disease, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced gastropathy. PPIs have minimal side effects, few significant drug interactions, and are generally considered safe for long-term treatment. PPIs have shown great success in treating acid-related gastrointestinal diseases.A DRC ICP-MS based method has been investigated in every step of synthesis in order to establish the source of heavy metals contamination for monitoring trace metals during synthesis to meet rigorous standard Limit requirements. Heavy metal contamination of bulk drug sub, stances and their intermediates may be introduced in many ways, such as from raw materials, reagents, solvents, and from electrodes used insynthesis. A quadruple ICP-MS equipped with DRC was employed for the determination of 15 elements (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb Pd, Pt, Sb, Se, Sn,V, and Zn) in the samples. Ammonia (NH(3)) was used as the reaction gas in the DRC mode; the effectiveness of NH(3) in reducing or eliminating polyatomic ions is reported.									5	0	0	2	0	5			0195-5373			WOS:000262393900001		
J	Katsiyannis, Antonis; Conroy, Maureen; Zhang, Dalun								District-Level Administrators' Perspectives on the Implementation of Functional Behavior Assessment in Schools								BEHAVIORAL DISORDERS				34	1			14	26					NOV 2008	2008	Since the reauthorization of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA; 1997) through the current reauthorization (IDEA 2004), disciplinary procedures and functional behavioral assessment (FBA) have been widely used in school districts to assist in the prevention and amelioration of problem behaviors. Although researchers have documented the effectiveness of FBA strategies in identifying environmental factors that contribute to and maintain problem behavior, less is known about how personnel in school districts are actually using FBA procedures. This survey examined district-level administrators' perspectives regarding their district's use of FBA procedures across two southern states (Florida and South Carolina). Major findings indicate that conducting FBA procedures was mostly useful for dealing with chronic problem behavior, followed by verbal aggression and physical aggression. The FBA procedures were least useful in dealing with drug-related behaviors, weapon-related behaviors, and truancy. However, respondents indicated that chronic behaviors and verbal aggression were more likely to result in an FBA if they occurred at the high-intensity and moderate-intensity level, respectively, whereas physical aggression was more likely to lead to the initiation of an FBA at the low-intensity level. Also, respondents indicated that they were likely to use indirect FBA strategies, rather than direct measures, and to use a team of professionals when conducting FBA. Implications of these findings are discussed.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0198-7429			WOS:000207643200002

The results showed that yields of total oil were reduced 9-22% compared to initial oil in the canola flake, but as high as 445 mg/l arachidonic acid (ARA, C20:4n6) and 67 mg/l eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5n3) were produced. The percentages of ARA and EPA of total fatty acids in this fermented oil were 15.5% and 2.3%, respectively. Supercritical CO2 extraction was then investigated for the lipid recovery from fermented canola flake, and extraction kinetics were modeled. The feasibility was demonstrated for production of PUFAs in a laboratory-scale fermentor using canola flake as a single nutrient, and for lipid extraction using supercritical CO2.

We have shown that exercise stress can increase susceptibility (morbidity, symptom severity and mortality) to HSV-1 respiratory infection, but there is little evidence on the effects of stressful exercise on susceptibility to the principal etiological agents of human respiratory infections, including influenza viruses. This study examined the effects of stressful exercise on susceptibility to influenza virus (A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1)). Mice were assigned to one of two groups: exercise (Ex) or control (Con). Exercise consisted of a treadmill run to volitional fatigue (similar to 120 min) performed on three consecutive days. Fifteen minutes after the last bout of exercise or rest, mice (n = 20-21/group) were intranasally inoculated with a standardized dose of influenza virus (0.25 HAU). Mice were monitored daily for morbidity (time to sickness), symptom severity and mortality (time to death) for 21 days. Exercise stress was associated with an increase in susceptibility to infection (morbidity, mortality and symptom severity on days 6 and 7; P < 0.05). These data from a controlled influenza virus challenge model add significantly to the growing body of evidence that severe exercise can increase susceptibility to URTI. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Eight mixtures [six recycled mixtures containing rubberized reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) and two control virgin mixtures] were designed and tested. Two types of aggregates were used in this research project. The rubberized RAP used in the study was artificially aged in the laboratory using an accelerated aging processes. The percentages of the RAP, by total weight of the mix, incorporated into the recycled mixtures were 15%, 25%, and 35%. Evaluation of all mixtures included the following testing procedures: tensile strength ratio (TSR), asphalt pavement analyzer (APA), resilient modulus, and indirect tensile strength (ITS) after long-term oven aging. The results from this study showed that (i) the recycled aged CRM mixtures (with 15%, 25%, and 35% rubberized RAP) can satisfy the current Superpave mixture requirements, including moisture susceptibility and rutting resistance, and (ii) in general, there was no significant difference between the control and the recycled CRM mixtures for the properties evaluated in this study.									2	1	0	0	0	3			0315-1468			WOS:000261788200011

The physical characteristics of the carbons were obtained from low temperature nitrogen adsorption isotherms using BET, DR, and DFT models. Their surface chemistry was characterized by water vapor adsorption, pH of the point of zero charge, acid/base uptakes, and elemental analysis. The results indicated that adsorbent pore structure characteristics and adsorbate molecular conformation are important in the adsorption of SOCs by porous carbonaceous adsorbents. To predict the adsorption of SOCs by activated carbons, accurate characterization of pore shape and size distribution in primary micropores is important. The results indicated that adsorbate molecules can access and fill more efficiently the slit-shape pores than ellipsoidal pores, whereas the ellipsoidal pores create higher adsorption potential than slit-shape pores. Both molecular conformation and dimensions of adsorbate affect the adsorption. Planar molecules appear to access and pack in slit-shape pores more efficiently as compared to nonplanar molecules. Nonplanar molecular conformation weakens the interactions between adsorbate molecules and carbon surfaces. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

PCE was primarily transformed to trichloroethylene by ZVZ, with 1,2-trans-dichloroethylene representing a minor product. Dechlorination of PCE was accelerated by the presence of HAP, and the pseudo-first order rate constants increased with increasing amount of HAP. Zn(II), mostly generated from oxidative dissolution of ZVZ by PCE, was effectively removed from the solution by HAP. Ion substitution, coprecipitation, and adsorption are proposed as the possible mechanisms for Zn(II) removal. These reactions appeared to occur simultaneously and the contribution of each reaction to overall removal of Zn(II) was primarily dependent on HAP loading at constant ZVZ loading. The results indicate that the use of HAP in combination with conventional zero-valent metals is promising in that it can achieve both degradation of organic contaminants and stabilization of inorganic contaminants.

The effect of the carbon shells on the plasmon resonance of the silver nanoparticles and their stability in sodium chloride solutions was investigated. The shell thickness can be adjusted to have insignificant damping of the plasmon resonance and provide stabilization of the particles in solutions with high ionic strength.

A part of the microcantilever beam surface is covered by a piezoelectric layer, which acts as an actuator. Inextensibility condition and the coupling between electrical and mechanical properties in piezoelectric materials are considered in the bending vibrations of the beam. The adsorbed biological layer is considered to be a monolayer and its adsorption induced surface stress is formulated from the molecular viewpoint. The nonlinear terms in the governing equations of motion of the beam appear in the quadratic form due to the presence of the piezoelectric layer, and the cubic form due to geometry of the beam and the adsorbed biological layer. Through extensive numerical simulations, it is demonstrated that the nonlinear effect of piezoelectric layer is significant in the microcantilever resonance sensing range. It is also shown that the effect of intermolecular attraction-repulsion on the surface stress is less dominant than other sources of surface stress (e.g., the electrostatic forces). Finally, it is observed that piezoelectrically-actuated microcantilever provides the ability of indirect measurement of vibrations and frequency response characteristics, instead of using bulky laser sensor.

Short-term aging characterization of asphalt binders using gel permeation chromatography and selected Superpave binder tests								CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS				22	11			2220	2227		10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2007.08.005			NOV 2008	2008	Both the rolling thin film oven test (RTFOT) and the short-term oven aging (STOA) methods are used ill the laboratory to represent the aging of an asphalt binder during plant mixing, transportation and paving. The RTFOT is conducted at 163 degrees C for 85 min, and the recommended STOA methods are to heat the loose mix in a forced draft oven either at 135 degrees C for 4 h or at 154 degrees C for 2 h dependent on the asphalt binder's stiffness. The actual time of short-term aging ill the field varies depending oil hauling distances or paving times.This research was initiated to compare the aging effects of the RTFOT and the STOA methods using the gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and selected Superpave binder tests. For this study, nine asphalt binders were prepared, and five aging periods were used for the RTFOT and four aging treatments were selected for the STOA. Loose asphalt mixes were obtained from six field projects. The results of GPC test showed that the RTFOT method has less aging effect on the binders than the STOA methods for asphalt mixtures prepared in the laboratory. Given the limited number of samples from the field, it was difficult to find any correlation of short-term aging between the laboratory and the field. The longer the aging time ill the RTFOT led to an increase in the high temperature viscosity and the high failure temperature of asphalt binders, the only exception being the rubber-modified binders. The GPC was effective ill evaluating the aging effect of rubber-modified binders using different RTFOT aging times. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Dynamic Periods and Building Damage at Charleston, South Carolina During the 1886 Earthquake								EARTHQUAKE SPECTRA				24	4			867	888		10.1193/1.2980346			NOV 2008	2008	Fundamental dynamic periods of Quaternary deposits beneath the peninsula of Charleston, South Carolina, are characterized spatially using an updated isopach map of Quaternary thickness, characteristic small-strain shear wave velocity information, a 1:24,000 geologic map, and a simple approximating equation. The updated isopach map is developed from subsurface information from 266 investigation sites. Estimates of fundamental periods for the Quaternary sediments primarily range between 0.3 and 0.7 s. These periods are lower end estimates of actual ground periods, based on a comparison with modeled response-spectra ratios. Estimates of fundamental periods range from 0.1 to 0.4 s for over 95% of the buildings present in 1886. Thus, the overlap between the range of building periods and the range in periods corresponding to high spectral ratios is not great. This finding agrees with the observation of Marciano and Elton that damage was independent (or only slightly dependent) of building height.									5	1	0	0	0	5			8755-2930			WOS:000264125600003

Environmental fluctuations that enhance population variability are generally expected to destabilize community and ecosystem properties, but this will depend on the degree to which populations are synchronized in their dynamics. Here we use seminatural experimental ponds to show that reduced synchrony among zooplankton taxa increases the temporal stability of zooplankton density, abundance, and ecosystem productivity influctuating environments. However, asynchrony only occurs at long timescales (similar to 80-day periods) and under recurring environmental perturbations. At shorter timescales (similar to 10-day periods) and in constant environments, synchronous dynamics dominate. Our findings support recent theory indicating that compensatory dynamics can stabilize communities and ecosystems. They further indicate that environmental fluctuations can enhance the likelihood of long-period asynchrony and thus stabilize community and ecosystem properties despite their short term destabilizing effects.									31	1	0	29	0	32			0012-9658			WOS:000261053500024

The term damage is defined herein as the violation of serviceability requirements such as exceeding the threshold principal strain in the building. In this paper the model uncertainty or model bias, characterised by applying Bayesian mapping and reliability techniques, and its relationship to prior knowledge of damage potential ( probability) are analysed. The concept of apparent model bias factor is introduced, and an iterative procedure is developed to tackle the issue of prior probability in the calibration of apparent model bias factor. Satisfactory results are obtained with the developed iterative procedure for estimating the probability of damage of buildings caused by excavation.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0016-8505			WOS:000259970300005

Its potential use as a highly sensitive sensing platform is discussed. We find high sensitivity of this Duffing system near its bistability point in a gaseous environment. The response of the higher harmonics of the measured charge on the cantilever induced by an ac voltage that drives the counter electrode is investigated. In particular, we follow the Duffing behavior at the higher harmonics (up to the sixth harmonic) as a function of gap distance between the cantilever and counter electrode. To our knowledge, this work represents the first experimental demonstration of sensing a pressure change using the Duffing behavior.									6	2	0	0	0	7			1530-437X			WOS:000261545600014

Past research has treated CSE as a unitary concept. This paper proposes that CSE has two dimensions-internal and external. The idea that CSE has internal and external dimensions is based on attribution theory, which identifies the human tendency to attribute events to causes that are either internal or external to the self. The internal CSE dimension focuses on how individuals perceive their capacity to use computers independently (i.e., without help). The external CSE dimension focuses on how individuals perceive their ability to use computers with human assistance and other forms of external support. Using items drawn from the Compeau and Higgins' CSE instrument, this paper examines each dimension's relationship to computer anxiety and perceived ease-of-use of information technology. The paper also reports on six studies that examine this proposal, and contributes to the literature by identifying two distinct CSE dimensions, developing theory-driven explanations for their relationships to constructs within the CSE's nomological network, and empirically establishing that they have distinct effects. Implications for research and practice are presented.									15	0	0	0	0	15			0018-9391			WOS:000260385400009		
J	Saeidpourazar, Reza; Jalili, Nader								Microcantilever-Based Force Tracking With Applications to High-Resolution Imaging and Nanomanipulation								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS				55	11			3935	3943		10.1109/TIE.2008.2002737			NOV 2008	2008	This paper presents the development and implementation of a robust nonlinear control framework for piezoresistive nanomechanical-cantilever (NMC)-based force tracking with applications to high-resolution imaging and nanomanipulation. Among many nanoscale force sensing platforms, NMC is an attractive approach to measure and apply forces at this scale when compared with other previously reported configurations utilizing complicated MEMS devices or inconvenient-to-handle nanowires and nanotubes. More specifically, a piezoresistive layer is utilized here to measure nanoscale forces at the NMC's tip instead of bulky laser-based feedback that is commonly used in atomic force microscopy. Excluding the laser from the sensing loop offers a compact, inexpensive, and portable yet precise nanoscale force sensing platform. In order to track a predefined force trajectory at the NMC's tip, there is a need to model the piezoresistive NMC and design appropriate controller to move its base to provide the desired force. In previous publications of the authors, a new distributed-parameter modeling framework has been proposed to precisely predict the force acting on the microcantilever's tip. In contrast to this approach and in an effort to ease the follow-up controller development, the NMC-based force sensor is modeled here as a lumped-parameter system. However, replacing the NMC with a linear mass-spring-damper trio creates a variety of uncertainties and unmodeled dynamics that need to be addressed for a precise force sensor's readout. Moreover, the very slow response of NMC's piezoresistive layer to force variations at the NMC's tip makes the tracking problem even more challenging. For this, a modified robust controller, built around sliding mode control strategy and augmented with a perturbation estimation module, is proposed to overcome these roadblocks. Extensive numerical simulations and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the stability and performance characteristics of the designed controller. It is shown that utilizing the proposed controller instead of the commonly used proportional-integral-derivative controller can significantly enhance the controller's stability and performance characteristics and, ultimately, the imaging resolution and manipulation accuracy needed at this scale.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0278-0046			WOS:000260866600016

A single fault acting on a specific actuator or on a specific sensor of the manipulator is detected (and, if possible, the exact location of the fault), and an estimation of the fault signal is performed. Input-signal estimator and output observers are considered in order to make the FD procedure possible. By using the suboptimal second-order sliding-mode (SOSM) algorithm to design the input laws of the observers, satisfactory stability properties of the observation error are established. The proposed algorithm is verified in simulation and experimentally on a COMAU SMART3-S2 robot manipulator.									45	2	0	0	0	47			0278-0046			WOS:000260866600018

This unrealistically skews the problem in favor of the pursuer who needs only maintain a faster velocity at all turning radii. In real life, an evader usually escapes when the pursuer no longer knows the evader's position. In our previous work, we modeled pursuit evasion without perfect information as a two-player bimatrix game by using a realistic sensor model and information theory to compute game-theoretic payoff matrices. That game as a saddle point when the evader uses strategies that exploit sensor limitations, whereas the pursuer relies on strategies that ignore the sensing limitations. In this paper, we consider, for the first time, the effect of many types of electronic countermeasures (ECM) on pursuit-evasion games. The evader's decision to initiate its ECM is modeled as a function of the distance between the players. Simulations show how to find optimal strategies for ECM use when initial conditions are known. We also discuss the effectiveness of different ECM technologies in pursuit-evasion games.									12	0	0	0	0	12			1083-4427	1558-2426		WOS:000260899700008

Non-linear vibrations of cantilever beams with feedback delays								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NON-LINEAR MECHANICS				43	9			962	978		10.1016/j.ijnonlinmec.2008.07.005			NOV 2008	2008	A comprehensive investigation of the effect of feedback delays on the non-linear vibrations of a piezoelectrically actuated cantilever beam is presented. in the first part of this work. we examine the linear and non-linear free responses of a beam subjected to a delayed-acceleration feedback. We show that the trivial solution loses stability via a Hopf bifurcation leading to limit-cycle oscillations. We analyze the stability of the dynamic response in the postbifurcation, close to the stability boundaries by examining the nature of the Hopf bifurcation and away from the stability boundaries by using the method of harmonic balance and Floquet theory. We find that. increasing the gain for certain feedback delays may culminate in quasiperiodic and chaotic oscillations of the beam.In the second part, we analyze the effect of feedback delays on a beam subjected to a harmonic base excitations. We find that the nature of the forced response is largely defined by the stability of the trivial solutions of the unforced response. For stable trivial solutions (i.e., inside the stability boundaries of the trivial solutions), the homogeneous response emanating from the feedback diminishes, leaving only the particular solution resulting from the external excitation. In this case, delayed feedback acts as a vibration absorber. On the other hand, for unstable trivial solutions. the response contains two co-existing frequencies. Depending on the excitation amplitude and the commensurability of the delayed-response frequency to the excitation frequency, the response is either periodic or quasiperiodic. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Steers were supplemented with either corn grain (0.52% BW on a DM basis; PC) or soybean hulls plus corn oil (0.45% BW on a DM basis + 0.10% BW on an as-fed basis; PO) using Calan gates for individual intake measurement. Negative, pasture only (PA), and positive, high-concentrate control diets (85% concentrate: 15% roughage on DM basis; C) were also included in the study. Steers on PC, PO, and PA treatments were managed together under a rotational grazing system, whereas C steers were fed a high-concentrate diet for the final 113 d using Calan gates. Forage DMI and apparent DM and NDF digestibility for the grazing treatments were evaluated using Cr2O5 and indigestible NDF as digesta markers. Energy supplementation decreased (P = 0.02) forage DMI (% of BW) with respect to PA, but not (P = 0.58) total DMI. There were no differences (P = 0.53) among grazing treatments on apparent total DM digestibility. However, NDF digestibility was less (P <= 0.05) in PC than in PO and PA; the latter 2 treatments did not differ (P > 0.05). Overall ADG was greater (P < 0.01) in supplemented, regardless of type, than in nonsupplemented grazing treatments. During the final 113 d, ADG was greater (P < 0.01) in C than in the grazing treatments. Overall supplement conversion did not differ (P = 0.73) between supplement types and was less (P = 0.006) than C. Carcass traits did not differ (P > 0.05) between energy sources. Dressing percentage and HCW were greater (P < 0.01) in supplemented cattle than in PA. Fat thickness and KPH percentage for PA were less (P < 0.05) than for PO but did not differ (P > 0.14) from PC. Marbling score, LM area, and quality grade did not differ (P > 0.05) between grazing treatments. Hot carcass weight for C was heavier (P < 0.001) than for pastured cattle. Quality and yield grades of C carcasses were also greater (P < 0.001) than carcasses from pastured steers. Energy supplementation, regardless of source, to grazing steers increased ADG, dressing percentage, and carcass weight compared with PA steers; however, supplemented steers had less ADG, efficiency, dressing percentage, and carcass weight compared with high-concentrate finished steers.									8	0	0	7	0	8			0021-8812			WOS:000260425000041	18539823

Characterization of the Caulobacter crescentus Holdfast Polysaccharide Biosynthesis Pathway Reveals Significant Redundancy in the Initiating Glycosyltransferase and Polymerase Steps								JOURNAL OF BACTERIOLOGY				190	21			7219	7231		10.1128/JB.01003-08			NOV 2008	2008	Caulobacter crescentus cells adhere to surfaces by using an extremely strong polar adhesin called the holdfast. The polysaccharide component of the holdfast is comprised in part of oligomers of N-acetylglucosamine. The genes involved in the export of the holdfast polysaccharide and the anchoring of the holdfast to the cell were previously discovered. In this study, we identified a cluster of polysaccharide biosynthesis genes (hfsEFGH) directly adjacent to the holdfast polysaccharide export genes. Sequence analysis indicated that these genes are involved in the biosynthesis of the minimum repeat unit of the holdfast polysaccharide. HfsE is predicted to be a UDP-sugar lipid-carrier transferase, the glycosyltransferase that catalyzes the first step in polysaccharide biosynthesis. HfsF is predicted to be a flippase, HfsG is a glycosyltransferase, and HfsH is similar to a polysaccharide ( \chitin) deacetylase. In-frame hfsG and hfsH deletion mutants resulted in severe deficiencies both in surface adhesion and in binding to the holdfast-specific lectin wheat germ agglutinin. In contrast, hfsE and hfsF mutants exhibited nearly wild-type levels of adhesion and holdfast synthesis. We identified three paralogs to hfsE, two of which are redundant to hfsE for holdfast synthesis. We also identified a redundant paralog to the hfsC gene, encoding the putative polysaccharide polymerase, and present evidence that the hfsE and hfsC paralogs, together with the hfs genes, are absolutely required for proper holdfast synthesis.									31	0	0	27	0	31			0021-9193			WOS:000260166900032	18757530

Membrane Fractionation Processes for Removing 90% to 95% of the Lactose and Sodium from Skim Milk and for Preparing Lactose and Sodium-Reduced Skim Milk								JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE				73	9			C639	C647		10.1111/j.1750-3841.2008.00961.x			NOV-DEC 2008	2008	Pilot-scale microfiltration (MF), microfiltration-diafiltration (MDF), ultrafiltration (UF), ultrafiltration-diafiltration (UDF), and nanofilration (NF) membrane fractionation processes were designed and evaluated for removing 90% to 95% of the lactose and sodium from skim milk. The study was designed to evaluate several membrane fractionation schemes as a function of: (1) membrane types with and without diafiltration; (2) fractionation process temperatures ranging from 17 to 45 degrees C; (3) sources of commercial drinking water used as diafiltrant; and (4) final mass concentration ratios (MCR) ranging from about 2 to 5. MF and MDF membranes provided highest flux values, but were unsatisfactory because they failed to retain all of the whey proteins. UDF fractionation processes removed more than 90% to 95% of the lactose and sodium from skim milk. NF permeate prepared from UDF cumulative permeate contained sodium and other mineral concentrations that would make them unsuitable for use as a diafiltrant for UDF applications. A method was devised for preparing simulated milk permeate (SMP) formulated with calcium, magnesium, and potassium hydroxides, and phosphoric and citric acids for use as UDF diafiltrant or for preparing lactose and sodium reduced skim milk (L-RSM). MF retentates with MCR values of 4.7 to 5.0 exhibited extremely poor frozen storage stabilities of less than 1 wk at -20 degrees C, whereas MCR 1.77 to 2.95 MDF and UDF retentates and skim milk control exhibited frozen storage stabilities of more than 16 wk. L-RSM exhibited a whiter appearance and a lower viscosity than skim milk, lacked natural milk flavor, and exhibited a metallic off-flavor.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0022-1147	1750-3841		WOS:000262834900008	19021794

Consumer Preferences for Mild Cheddar Cheese Flavors								JOURNAL OF FOOD SCIENCE				73	9			S449	S455		10.1111/j.1750-3841.2008.00960.x			NOV-DEC 2008	2008	Flavor is an important factor in consumer selection of cheeses. Mild Cheddar cheese is the classification used to describe Cheddar cheese that is not aged extensively and has a "mild" flavor. However, there is no legal definition or age limit for Cheddar cheese to be labeled mild, medium, or sharp, nor are the flavor profiles or flavor expectations of these cheeses specifically defined. The objectives of this study were to document the distinct flavor profiles among commercially labeled mild Cheddar cheeses, and to characterize if consumer preferences existed for specific mild Cheddar cheese flavors or flavor profiles. Flavor descriptive sensory profiles of a representative array of commercial Cheddar cheeses labeled as mild (n = 22) were determined using a trained sensory panel and an established cheese flavor sensory language. Nine representative Cheddar cheeses were selected for consumer testing. Consumers (n = 215) assessed the cheeses for overall liking and other consumer liking attributes. Internal preference mapping, cluster analysis, and discriminant analysis were conducted. Mild Cheddar cheeses were diverse in flavor with many displaying flavors typically associated with more age. Four distinct consumer clusters were identified. The key drivers of liking for mild Cheddar cheese were: color, cooked/milky, whey and brothy flavors, and sour taste. Consumers have distinct flavor and color preferences for mild Cheddar cheese. These results can help manufacturers understand consumer preferences for mild Cheddar cheese.									13	0	0	11	0	13			0022-1147			WOS:000262834900026	19021820

The findings revealed that anxiety is a major reaction to the diagnosis. Because of the parents' reactions, communication barriers and parental role changes are established between the parent and child. The lack of communication between the parent and child during diagnosis and treatment and parental role changes produce negative outcomes. Negative outcomes place the parent and child at risk for experiencing anxiety years after the illness is treated. This literature review describes positive outcomes that can be accomplished by decreasing the anxiety of parents, which leads to a decrease in communication barriers and parental role changes during the new diagnosis of leukemia. Interventions are provided to increase the support and resources of parents during this phase of the disease. Future research may focus on interventions to decrease anxiety, which will increase communication, produce positive outcomes for treatment, and decrease stress years after the disease is treated.									5	0	0	3	2	7			1043-4542			WOS:000260236300004	18780900

This new method is introduced and discussed under the context of Mie scattering calculations. Past work on Mie calculations has mostly relied on calculating the Bessel functions separately, then taking the ratio. This technique fails when the order of the functions becomes appreciably larger than the argument. To solve this problem, we developed a stable method to directly calculate the ratio. When applied to Mie scattering calculations, the new method improves the control of the desired accuracy and enables calculations with higher precision. Since many other wave propagation problems also involve the ratios of Bessel functions and our method provides reliable and accurate calculations over a wide range of conditions, we expect it to find applications beyond Mie calculations.

The effect of extraction method (ethanol concentration and extraction time), protein removal, and sample preparation method (pulverization or freeze drying) were first evaluated to develop an antioxidant assay for meat products. Beef extracts prepared with low ethanol concentrations (20%) demonstrated higher hydrophilic ORAC. Protein removal prior to extraction reduced hydrophilic ORAC values. Sample preparation method influenced both hydrophilic and lipophilic ORAC, with pulverized samples containing higher hydrophilic and lipophilic ORAC values. Beef cattle finishing system (Forage: alfalfa, pearl millet, or natural pasture vs. concentrates) had little impact on muscle hydrophilic ORAC, but muscle from forage finished beef contained greater lipophilic ORAC. In addition, broiling of steaks reduced hydrophilic ORAC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.									28	1	0	15	3	29			0309-1740			WOS:000259844300013	22063579

Because of low infectious doses for most foodborne pathogens, the rapid and sensitive detection methods are essential to ensure the food safety. The advances in the development of nanomaterials have stimulated worldwide research interests in their applications for bioanalysis. The conjugation of biomolecules with nanomaterials is the foundation of nano-biorecognition. A variety of strategies including antibody-antigen, adhesin-receptor, antibiotic, and complementary DNA sequence recognitions have been explored for specific recognition between target bacterial cells and bio-functionalized nanomaterials. The incorporation of these bio-functionalized nanomaterials into current pathogen detection methods has led to rapid and nearly real-time pathogen detection (as short as a few minutes), improved sensitivity (single bacterial cell), and simultaneous detection of multiple micro-organisms from either nutrient broth, liquid or solid food products, or biofilms. The unique properties of nanomaterials in physical strength, chemical reactivity, electrical conductance, magnetism and optical effects make them promising in the development of practical biosensors with emphasis on device portability and simplicity in sample preparation, and the improvement of current pathogen detection methods.									32	1	0	19	0	33			1613-4982			WOS:000259482500001

This method increased transformation efficiency up to 10 x (42%) over previous reports with an average efficiency of 25% of hypocotyl slices producing transgenic plants. Timing of each step in the protocol was optimized producing self-rooted transgenic plants in the greenhouse in approximately 6 months. In order to test the system for its utility in functional genomic studies, we developed two hairpin constructs using a fragment of the peach (P. persica) Phytoene desaturase (PDS) gene. When A. tumefaciens with these constructs was used for targeted post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS), approximately 50% of the transformed plums were knockout PDS gene plants. The easy and efficient plum transformation protocol that we report here can be readily used for functional genomics studies in Prunus specifically, and Rosaceae and other woody species in general.									44	1	0	38	0	46			1380-3743			WOS:000259440700007

Thus, understanding and control of defects, including dopants in low-dimensional systems, hold great promise for engineered materials and nanoscale devices. Here, we characterize experimentally the effects of a single defect on electrons and phonons in single-wall carbon nanotubes. The effects demonstrated here are unusual in that they are not caused by defect-induced symmetry breaking. Electrons and phonons are strongly coupled in sp(2) carbon systems, and a defect causes renormalization of electron and phonon energies. We find that near a negatively charged defect, the electron velocity is increased, which in turn influences lattice vibrations locally. Combining measurements on nanotube ensembles and on single nanotubes, we capture the relation between atomic response and the readily accessible macroscopic behaviour.									153	3	0	5	0	153			1476-1122	1476-4660		WOS:000260472800021	18931672

Overweight Girls Who Internalize Fat Stereotypes Report Low Psychosocial Well-being								OBESITY				16				S30	S38		10.1038/oby.2008.451		2	NOV 2008	2008	Objective: This study examines developmental change and intraindividual stability in girls' fat stereotypes and associations between girls' internalization of stereotypes and their psychosocial well-being.Methods and Procedures: Participants included 163 non-Hispanic white girls. Girls' fat stereotypes were assessed at ages 9 and 11 years and their height and weight and all measures of psychosocial well-being, including global self-worth, perceived physical appearance, and maladaptive eating attitudes, were assessed at ages 9, 11, and 13 years. Change in girls' fat stereotypes between ages 9 and 11 was assessed using Repeated Measures ANOVA. Intraindividual stability in stereotypes was assessed using Spearman rank correlation analysis. Planned comparisons were used to test the hypothesis that overweight girls who internalize fat stereotypes are at heightened risk of poor psychosocial well-being.Results: Girls' fat stereotypes decreased significantly between ages 9 and 11. Moderate intraindividual stability was observed in overweight girls', but not nonoverweight girls', reported stereotypes. As predicted, overweight girls who reported high fat stereotypes reported significantly lower psychosocial well-being than all other girls in the sample, independent of their weight status.Discussion: Findings suggest that overweight girls may be particularly sensitive to weight-based stereotypes and may experience poor psychosocial well-being when they internalize stereotypes. Health practitioners working with overweight girls need to be aware of girls' sensitivity to weight-based stereotypes and should actively work against condoning and reinforcing such stereotypes.									18	1	0	6	0	19			1930-7381			WOS:000260860700006	18978761

Our pulley coupler configuration demonstrates coupling of the resonators to monolithically integrated photonic wire waveguides without resorting to demanding fine-line lithography. Microdisk resonators in As(2)S(3) support whispering-gallery-mode with cavity quality factors (Q) exceeding 2 x 10(5), the highest Q value reported in resonator structures in chalcogenide glasses to the best of our knowledge. We have successfully demonstrated a lab-on-a-chip prototype sensor device with the integration of our resonator with planar microfluidic systems. The sensor shows a refractive index sensitivity of 182 nm/RIU (refractive index unit) and a wavelength resolution of 0.1 pm through a resonant peak fit. This corresponds to a refractive index detection limit of 8 x 10(-7) RIU at 1550 nm in wavelength, which could be further improved by shifting the operating wavelength to a region where water absorption is reduced.

Modeling the time-reversal-breaking ordered state by the chiral d-density-wave state, we find that the magnitude of the Nernst effect can be sizable even at temperatures much higher than the superconducting transition temperature. These results imply that the experimentally found Nernst effect at the pseudogap temperatures may be due to the chiral d-density-wave ordered state with broken time-reversal invariance.									19	0	0	0	0	19			1098-0121			WOS:000261214500076

The proposed size complexity measure is based on the information theoretic definition of complexity that connects the complexity of a design to the level of entropy, or uncertainty, inherent in the design product. The proposed coupling complexity measure evaluates the decomposability of the graph-based representation of design products. To validate the proposed measures, an experiment is conducted to calculate the complexities of three consumer products based on three product representations, namely, function structure, connectivity graph, and parametric associativity graph. The findings indicate that coupling and size are independent measures of a product's complexity. Thus, it is recommended that both measures should be used. Further, the complexity of a product is not independent of the choice of representation model used to describe the product. This suggests that the complexity of a product will vary with the selected view. Finally, it is shown that the two approaches for measuring complexity of a product are generalizable and can be applied to different representations.									46	0	0	0	0	46			0934-9839			WOS:000260769800007

The fate of nanomaterials in living systems and in the environment is largely unknown, though there is a reason for concern. Here it is shown how the interaction of fullerene with natural phenolic acid induces cell contraction. This phenomenon has a general applicability to carbon-based nanomaterials interacting with natural amphiphiles. Atomistic simulations reveal that the self-assembly of C(70)-gallic acid (GA) favors aggregation. Confocal fluorescence microscopy shows that C(70)-GA complexes translocate across the membranes of HT-29 cells and enter nuclear membranes. Confocal imaging further reveals the real-time uptake of C(70)-GA and the consequent contraction of the cell membranes. This contraction is attributed to the aggregation of nanoparticles into microsized particles promoted by cell surfaces, a new physical mechanism for deciphering nanotoxicity.									30	1	0	7	0	31			1613-6810			WOS:000261230400022	18949789

The procedure is motivated by the problem of detecting an early change in the mean of returns and is based on the CUSUM (cumulative sum) statistic. It terminates when the CUSUM crosses a boundary function or the number of collected observations reaches a prescribed number. We show that the stopping time is asymptotically normal. Simulations using models derived from returns on indexes and individual stocks show that the normal approximation holds in finite samples.									8	0	0	0	0	8			1133-0686			WOS:000261693400012

Measuring and modeling the variation in species-specific transpiration in temperate deciduous hardwoods								TREE PHYSIOLOGY				28	11			1675	1683					NOV 2008	2008	We investigated which parameters required by the MAESTRA model were most important in predicting leaf-area-based transpiration in 5-year-old trees of five deciduous hardwood species-yoshino cherry (Prunus x yedoensis Matsum.), red maple (Acer rubrum L. 'Autumn Flame'), trident maple (Acer buergeranum Miq.), Japanese flowering cherry (Prunus serrulata Lindl. 'Kwanzan') and London plane-tree (Platanus x acerifolia (Ait.) Willd.). Transpiration estimated from sap flow measured by the heat balance method in branches and trunks was compared with estimates predicted by the three-dimensional transpiration, photosynthesis and absorbed radiation model, MAESTRA. MAESTRA predicted species-specific transpiration front the interactions of leaf-level physiology and spatially explicit micro-scale weather patterns in a mixed deciduous hardwood plantation on a 15-min time step. The monthly differences between modeled mean daily transpiration estimates and measured mean daily sap flow ranged from a 35% underestimation for Acer buergeranum in June to a 25% overestimation for A. rubrum in July. The sensitivity of the modeled transpiration estimates was examined across a 30% error range for seven physiological input parameters. The minimum value of stomatal conductance as incident solar radiation tends to zero was determined to be eight times more influential than all other physiological model input parameters. This work quantified the major factors that influence modeled species-specific transpiration and confirmed the ability to scale leaf-level physiological attributes to whole-crown transpiration on a species-specific basis.									25	1	0	19	0	26			0829-318X			WOS:000260855200008	18765372

The adopted wastewater characteristics were based on data from several industrial wastewater treatment facilities. The simulations were performed at a variety of temperatures, solids retention times, dissolved oxygen concentrations, pH values, and salt concentrations. The nitrification operating window was defined, and denitrification performance was characterized. The pH and temperature were found to be the most important variables affecting nitrification performance under upset or startup conditions, with lower pH values allowing better performance at higher temperatures for the high-nitrogen wastewater used in the simulations. Emissions of nitric oxide and nitrous oxide were higher than generally thought to occur and were directly linked to depletion of the electron donor in the anoxic reactor. The findings concerning pH, temperature, and gaseous emissions were all consistent with the known growth characteristics of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria. Parameter and process variable sensitivity studies were performed, and guidelines for improved biological nitrogen removal were developed. Water Environ.

A new comprehensive activated sludge process model, the Activated Sludge Model for Nitrogen (ASMN), is presented. The ASMN incorporates two nitrifying populations-ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria-using free ammonia and free nitrous acid, respectively, as their true substrates. The ASMN incorporates four-step denitrification (sequential reduction of nitrate to nitrogen gas via nitrite, nitric oxide, and nitrous oxide) using individual, reaction-specific parameters. Simulation results for ammonia, nitrate, soluble substrate, and biomass concentrations determined by using ASMN for three activated sludge process configurations under steady-state and dynamic municipal-type influent conditions are shown to be comparable with ASM#1 results.

Halothiobacillus neapolitanus Carboxysomes Sequester Heterologous and Chimeric RubisCO Species								PLOS ONE				3	10					e3570	10.1371/journal.pone.0003570			OCT 30 2008	2008	Background: The carboxysome is a bacterial microcompartment that consists of a polyhedral protein shell filled with ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO), the enzyme that catalyzes the first step of CO(2) fixation via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle.Methodology/Principal Findings: To analyze the role of RubisCO in carboxysome biogenesis in vivo we have created a series of Halothiobacillus neapolitanus RubisCO mutants. We identified the large subunit of the enzyme as an important determinant for its sequestration into alpha-carboxysomes and found that the carboxysomes of H. neapolitanus readily incorporate chimeric and heterologous RubisCO species. Intriguingly, a mutant lacking carboxysomal RubisCO assembles empty carboxysome shells of apparently normal shape and composition.Conclusions/Significance: These results indicate that carboxysome shell architecture is not determined by the enzyme they normally sequester. Our study provides, for the first time, clear evidence that carboxysome contents can be manipulated and suggests future nanotechnological applications that are based upon engineered protein microcompartments.									33	1	0	33	0	34			1932-6203			WOS:000265131500005	18974784

Takaoka, Hiroyuki/G-6120-2010				Cytogenetics and morphotaxonomy of the Simulium (Gomphostilbia) ceylonicum species group (Diptera: Simuliidae) in Thailand								ZOOTAXA					1917			1	28					OCT 29 2008	2008	The polytene chromosomes of 1,612 larvae of three described morphospecies in the Simulium ( Gomphostilbia) ceylonicum species group-S. asakoae, S. inthanonense, and S. sheilae-were examined from 52 sites in Thailand. A standard map for the S. ceylonicum group was established. Ten cytoforms, plus an eleventh from the literature, are revealed on the basis of unique suites of fixed and floating inversions; sex chromosomes are microscopically undifferentiated in all cytoforms. A cytodendrogram, based on shared inversions, shows seven lineages in a polytomy derived from a hypothetical ancestor. Morphological descriptions of the known life stages of each cytoform and keys to larvae, pupae, and polytene chromosomes also are provided. Despite small sample sizes for some cytoforms, all segregates appear to be good species, supported by both chromosomal and morphological evidence. Three reproductively isolated cytoforms for which adequate material is available are formally described as new species. The existence of chromosomally distinct entities within established morphospecies of the S. ceylonicum group supports a recurrent trend of hidden biodiversity in Southeast Asian black flies. The differentiation of taxa that we found in the S. ceylonicum group between northern and southern Thailand conforms to a similar biogeographic trend in diverse organisms.									15	0	0	17	0	17			1175-5326	1175-5334		WOS:000260492800001

To do so, it is necessary to establish several new Turan type results for digraphs and characterize the associated extremal digraphs. In the case of the Radon number, we establish the following analogue for transitive closure in digraphs of Radon's classical convexity theorem 1). Radon, Mengen konvexer Korper, die einer gemeinsamen Punkt enthalten. Math. Ann. 83 (1921) 113-115]: in a complete digraph on n >= 7 vertices with > n(2)/4 arcs, it is possible to partition the arc set into two subsets whose transitive closures have an arc in common.

The addition of chromophores encapsulated into the polymers were prepared in good yields and characterized by H-1 and F-19 NMR and GPC. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) showed they posses high thermal stability with decomposition temperatures of 340-387 degrees C and 308-443 degrees C in nitrogen and air, respectively. Chromophore inclusion was confirmed by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, which demonstrated tailorable photoluminescence (PL) in both the solution and the solid state by selective substitution of the chromophore. Polymer thin film PL studies revealed notable red-shifts compared with polymer solutions presumably attributable to aggregation in the solid state. Solution quantum yields of the polymers were comparable to those reported for the single chromophores used in this study.									20	0	0	1	0	20			0024-9297			WOS:000260255800036

The chemical structure, mechanical properties, degradation rate, and swelling ratio were characterized by comparing the polymer with a polyurethane containing a 2,2(methylimino) diethanol chain extender. Due to the incorporation of negatively charged carboxyl side groups, the bicine extended polymers exhibited higher micro-phase separation, better mechanical properties in dry condition, and better sensitivity to environmental stimuli than controls, as demonstrated by its high swelling ratio at elevated pH, lower ionic strength, or higher temperature. The swelling ratio of membranes showed reversible change as the function of pH at 37 degrees C, the membranes becoming fully water soluble at pH above 8.3. Nile blue chloride and lysozyme were selected to study their release from this polymer. The release rates of both compounds were significantly influenced by the pH and ionic strength. The swelling ratios were also influenced by lysozyme loading at low pH. The pH dependent properties were used to fabricate scaffolds by drop-on-demand printing. Bicine extended polyurethanes may be of interest for possible drug delivery applications, customizable scaffold fabrication and other potential biomedical applications. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Evolution of Highly Pathogenic H5N1 Avian Influenza Viruses in Vietnam between 2001 and 2007								PLOS ONE				3	10					e3462	10.1371/journal.pone.0003462			OCT 21 2008	2008	Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses have caused dramatic economic losses to the poultry industry of Vietnam and continue to pose a serious threat to public health. As of June 2008, Vietnam had reported nearly one third of worldwide laboratory confirmed human H5N1 infections. To better understand the emergence, spread and evolution of H5N1 in Vietnam we studied over 300 H5N1 avian influenza viruses isolated from Vietnam since their first detection in 2001. Our phylogenetic analyses indicated that six genetically distinct H5N1 viruses were introduced into Vietnam during the past seven years. The H5N1 lineage that evolved following the introduction in 2003 of the A/duck/Hong Kong/821/2002-like viruses, with clade 1 hemagglutinin (HA), continued to predominate in southern Vietnam as of May 2007. A virus with a clade 2.3.4 HA newly introduced into northern Vietnam in 2007, reassorted with pre-existing clade 1 viruses, resulting in the emergence of novel genotypes with neuraminidase (NA) and/or internal gene segments from clade 1 viruses. A total of nine distinct genotypes have been present in Vietnam since 2001, including five that were circulating in 2007. At least four of these genotypes appear to have originated in Vietnam and represent novel H5N1 viruses not reported elsewhere. Geographic and temporal analyses of H5N1 infection dynamics in poultry suggest that the majority of viruses containing new genes were first detected in northern Vietnam and subsequently spread to southern Vietnam after reassorting with pre-existing local viruses in northern Vietnam. Although the routes of entry and spread of H5N1 in Vietnam remain speculative, enhanced poultry import controls and virologic surveillance efforts may help curb the entry and spread of new HPAI viral genes.									75	1	0	68	0	76			1932-6203			WOS:000265125900006	18941631

Creating such a superfluid in cold fermionic atom optical traps using p-wave Feshbach resonance is turning out to be challenging. Here we propose a method to create a p(x) + ip(y) superfluid directly from an s-wave interaction making use of a topological Berry phase, which can be artificially generated. We discuss ways to detect the spontaneous Hall mass current, which acts as a diagnostic for the chiral p-wave superfluid.									227	5	0	15	0	227			0031-9007			WOS:000260141300002	18999651

Branching ratios of various decay channels are calculated to evaluate the yields of Li, Be, and B produced through the v-process in supernova explosions. The new cross sections enhance the yields of Li-7 and B-11 produced during the supernova explosion of a 16.2 M-circle dot star model compared to the case using the conventional cross sections by about 10%. On the other hand, the yield of B-10 decreases by a factor of 2. The yields of Li-6, Be-9, and the radioactive nucleus Be-10 are found at a level of similar to 10(-11) M-circle dot. The temperature of v(mu,tau)- and (v) over bar (mu,tau)- neutrinos inferred from the supernova contribution of B-11 in Galactic chemical evolution models is constrained to the 4.3-6.5 MeV range. The increase in the Li-7 and B-11 yields due to neutrino oscillations is demonstrated with the new cross sections.									61	0	0	1	0	61			0004-637X	1538-4357		WOS:000259822200036

A 2(5) factorial experiment was conducted in a partially confounded incomplete block design and analyzed using the PROC MIXED procedure from SAS. A model gin was made of dried juniper berries (Juniperus communis), coriander seed (Coriandrum sativum), angelica root (Angelica archangelica), and dry lemon peel (Citrus limonum). This was distilled on a traditional still utilizing atmospheric pressure and a heating mantel to initiate phase separation as well as a novel still (high vacuum) utilizing high vacuum pressures below 0.1 mmHg and temperatures below -15 degrees C to initiate phase separation. The degradation products (alpha-pinene, alpha-phellandrene, E-caryophyllene, and beta-myrcene) were present at greater levels (similar to 10 times) in the traditional still-made gin as compared to the novel gin.									6	0	0	3	0	6			0021-8561			WOS:000259675300037	18771269

Specifically, plastic samples from partially denatured feathermeal protein were successfully produced by a compression-molding process. The modulus (stiffness) of the material obtained Was found to be comparable with that of commercial synthetic materials, such as polystyrene, but was found to have lower toughness characteristics, which is a common phenomenon among plastics produced from animal and plant proteins. A reversible stress-strain property was observed over the yield region. Plastic-forming conditions for undenatured animal proteins, such as albumen and whey proteins, were also formulated for fabricating plastics Out Of these proteins' blends with feathermeal proteins. The resultant plastic samples that were developed of biomacromolecular blends, Such as feathermeal/whey and feathermeal/albumen, demonstrated improved mechanical properties, specifically tensile strength, when compared with neat plastics from feathermeal proteins. The values for the stiffness of the feathermeal/whey blends deviated from simple mixing rule and showed a synergistic effect.

Scanning probe microscopy, ellipsometry and contact angle measurements were used to study their morphology, thickness and surface properties. GPTS and TMOS sol with SiO2 nanoparticles resulted in rough but transparent surface of homogeneous monolayer of similar to 40 nm. The rough surface mimicking lotus leaf was chemically modified with a layer of IBTMS resulting in the contact angle of nearly 130 degrees. Morphology as well as contact angles were dependent on the thickness of IBTMS hydrophobic coating layer. Process of creating rough but transparent and durable layer loaded with SiO2 particles demonstrates the feasibility of meeting all three desired characteristics of transparency, durability and superhydrophobicity.

These characteristics have constituted CNTs as an exciting new tool for drug delivery and biological sensing. While CNTs exhibit great potential in biomedical and pharmaceutical applications, neither the cell penetration mechanism of CNTs nor the intracellular fate of the internalized CNTs are fully understood. In this study, time-lapse fluorescence microscopy was used to investigate the intracellular distribution of FITC labeled PEGylated single-walled CNTs (FITC-PEG-SWCNTs) in living cells and shown that PEGylated SWCNTs entered the nucleus of several mammalian cell lines in an energy-dependent process. The presence of FITC-PEG-SWCNTs in the cell nucleus did not cause discernible changes in the nuclear organization and had no effect on the growth kinetics and cell cycle distribution for up to 5 days. Remarkably, upon removal of the FITC-PEG-SWCNTS from the culture medium, the internalized FITC-PEG-SWCNTs rapidly moved out of the nucleus and were released from the cells. Thus, the intracellular PEGylated SWCNTs were highly dynamic and the cell penetration of PEGylated SWCNTs appeared as bidirectional. These observations suggest SWCNTs may be used as an ideal nanovector in biomedical and pharmaceutical applications.									102	0	0	35	0	102			1936-0851			WOS:000260503100017	19206455

Na. K, Nb. Mo or W). It is demonstrated that the film appearance and thickness could be tailored via co-doping or changing the equilibration temperature. Furthermore. the observed discontinuous changes in film thickness, hysteresis and bimodal thickness distributions indicate a first-order monolayer-to-multilayer adsorption transition. which is interpreted as a coupled prewetting and premelting transition. The film thickness and stability are measured as functions of equilibration temperature. anneal time, thermal treatment history. co-doping, overall composition and TiO2 phase and orientation. The characterization of more than 850 independent films represents the most systematic measurement of similar interfacial films to date, providing insights into the formation mechanisms and the thermodynamic stability of equilibrium-thickness surficial films and analogous intergranular films.

Comparison of alternative upscaled model formulations for simulating DNAPL source dissolution and biodecay								ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES				31	10			1325	1332		10.1016/j.advwatres.2008.06.003			OCT 2008	2008	This paper compares the performance of analytical and numerical approaches for modeling DNAPL dissolution with biodecay. A solution derived from a 1-D advective transport formulation ("Parker" model) is shown to agree very closely with high resolution numerical solutions. A simple lumped source mass balance solution in which with decay is assumed proportional to DNAPL mass ("Falta1" model) over-or underpredicts aqueous phase biodecay depending on the magnitude of the exponential factor governing the relationship between dissolution rate and DNAPL mass. A modification of the Falta model that assumes decay proportional to the source exit concentration is capable of accurately simulating source behavior with strong aqueous phase biodecay if model parameters are appropriately selected or calibrated ("Falta2" model). However, parameters in the lumped models exhibit complex interdependencies that cannot be quantified without consideration of transport processes within the source zone. Combining the Falta2 solution with relationships derived from the Parker model was found to resolve these limitations and track the numerical model results. A method is presented to generalize the analytical solutions to enable simulation of partial mass removal with changes in source parameters over time due to various remedial actions. The algorithm is verified by comparison with numerical simulation results. An example application is presented that demonstrates the interactions of partial mass removal, enhanced biodecay, enhanced mass transfer and source zone flow reduction applied at various time periods on contaminant flux reduction. Increasing errors that arise in numerical solutions with coarse discretization and high decay rates are shown to be controlled by using an adjusted decay coefficient derived from the Parker analytical solution.

Data were collected from 2003 to 2007. Analyses were conducted in 2005 and 2008.Setting/participants: Nine lead organizations at 12 sites participated. Active Choices participants (n=2503) averaged 65.8 years (80% women, 41% non-Hispanic white). Active Living Every Day (ALED) participants (n=3388) averaged 70.6 years (83% women, 64% non-Hispanic white).Intervention: In AFL, Active Choices was a 6-month telephone-based and ALED a 20-week group-based lifestyle behavior change program designed to increase physical activity, and both were grounded in social cognitive theory and the transtheoretical model. The interventions were evaluated in Years 1, 3, and 4. An adapted shortened ALED program was evaluated in Year 4.Main outcome measure: Moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity, assessed with the CHAMPS self-reported measure.Results: Posttest survey response rates were 61% for Active Choices and 70% for ALED. Significant increases in moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity, total physical activity, and satisfaction with body appearance and function, and decreases in BMI were seen for both programs. Depressive symptoms and perceived stress, both low at pretest, also decreased over time in ALED. Results were generally consistent across years and sites.Conclusions: Active Choices and ALED were successfully translated across a range of real-world settings. Study samples were substantially larger, more ethnically and economically diverse, and more representative of older adult's health conditions than in efficacy studies, yet the magnitude of effect sizes were comparable.									66	0	0	18	1	67			0749-3797			WOS:000259308900004	18779028

Use and Selection of Bridges as Day Roosts by Rafinesque's Big-Eared Bats								AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST				160	2			386	399		10.1674/0003-0031(2008)160[386:UASOBA]2.0.CO;2			OCT 2008	2008	Rafinesque's big-eared bats (Corynorhinus rafinesquii) use bridges as day roosts in parts of their range, but information on bridge use across their range is lacking. From May to Aug. 2002 we surveyed 1129 bridges (12.5%) within all 46 counties of South Carolina to determine use and selection of bridges as day roosts by big-eared bats and to document their distribution across the state. During summer 2003, we visited 235 bridges in previously occupied areas of the state to evaluate short-term fidelity to bridge roosts. We found colonies and solitary big-eared bats beneath 38 bridges in 2002 and 54 bridges in 2003. Construction type and size of bridges strongly influenced use in both years; bats selected large, concrete girder bridges and avoided flat-bottomed slab bridges. The majority of occupied bridges (94.7%) were in the Upper and Lower Coastal Plains, but a few bridges (5.3%) were located in the Piedmont. Rafinesque's big-eared bats were absent beneath bridges in the Blue Ridge Mountains. We established new records of occurrence for 10 counties. In the Coastal Plains, big-eared bats exhibited a high degree of short-term fidelity to roosts in highway bridges. For bridges that were occupied at least once, mean frequency of use was 65.9%. Probability of finding bats under a bridge ranged from 0.46 to 0.73 depending on whether the bridge was occupied in the previous year. Thus, bridges should be inspected three to five times in a given year to determine whether they are being used. Regional bridge roost surveys may be a good method for determining the distribution of C. rafinesquii, particularly in the Coastal Plains, and protection of suitable bridges may be a viable conservation strategy where natural roost sites are limited.									4	0	0	4	0	4			0003-0031			WOS:000260189500012

Lymphoid tissue ontogeny in the mummichog, Fundulus heteroclitus								ANATOMICAL RECORD-ADVANCES IN INTEGRATIVE ANATOMY AND EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY				291	10			1236	1245		10.1002/ar.20740			OCT 2008	2008	Most studies that examine the ontogeny of lymphoid organ development in teleostean fishes use species of interest to aquaculture or genetic research and, to date, have focused strictly on marine or freshwater species. The mummichog, Fundulus heteroclitus, also known as the estuarine killifish, is a unique model for studies on developmental immunobiology, because it is euryhaline, has a high degree of thermal tolerance, and has a unique reproductive strategy. Embryonic and larval mummichogs were examined for the ontogeny of lymphoid tissue development. The first lymphoid organ to appear was the head kidney at 1 dph, followed by the spleen at 1 wph, and then the thymus at 3 wph. Rag-1 was partially cloned and sequenced and shown to be highly conserved among other vertebrate Rag-1 genes. Using QT-PCR to monitor the temporal expression of Rag-1, it was shown to reach a maximum intensity at 3 and 4 wph and then to drop to pre-2-wph levels. Overall, this study suggests that juvenile mummichogs do not possess the ability to mount T- or B-cell responses until some time after 5 wph. Even though the estuarine killifish tolerates a wide range of salinities, the developmental patterns of lymphoid tissues are similar to what has been reported for strictly marine (stenohaline) teleosts. Thus, the mummichog should be a convenient model for understanding the developmental immunobiology of most marine teleosts.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1932-8486			WOS:000259546400006	18727108	
J	Roby, Tiffany; Olsen, Shawn; Nagatomi, Jiro								Effect of sustained tension on bladder smooth muscle cells in three-dimensional culture								ANNALS OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING				36	10			1744	1751		10.1007/s10439-008-9545-5			OCT 2008	2008	Previous studies demonstrated that bladder cells respond to changes in their mechanical environments by exhibiting alterations in cellular functions, such as hypertrophy or fibrosis. In the present study, we hypothesize that changes in smooth muscle cell (SMC) behavior triggered by mechanical stimuli may represent a phenotypic shift between contractile and synthetic phenotypes. Using a custom-made device, rat bladder SMCs were cultured in three-dimensional (3-D) collagen gels and exposed to sustained tension. When compared to no-tension controls, SMCs exposed to tension exhibited significantly (p < 0.05) higher expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), while cell population density was similar in both groups. In addition, both mean and median aspect ratios of SMCs in 3-D collagen constructs exposed to tension were significantly (p < 0.05) greater than those of cells cultured under no externally applied tension, indicating that there are more elongated, spindle-shaped cells in the tension group. These SMCs in 3-D cultures exposed to tension also exhibited cellular alignment along the direction of applied tension. Since contractile SMCs are known to exhibit greater expression of phenotypic marker proteins as well as a more elongated morphology, we concluded that sustained tension on cells is an important mechanical stimulus for maintenance of the contractile phenotype of bladder SMCs in vitro.									16	0	0	11	0	16			0090-6964			WOS:000259125000014	18683053

A formalism of fuzzy control allows one to forecast the evolutionary behavior of a network. When the multivariate time series is converted to a single-component series, an excellent agreement is obtained between the actual and forecasted values. The tests include both simulated and realistic models. For a binary model, with random bit changes simulating mutations, this approach can be used to detect anomalies in the network evolution.

The purpose of this study is to find transient X-ray sources in M 31 and to investigate and classify their nature.Methods. Three X-ray transients were observed with Swift. For each of the three X-ray transients, we used the Swift X-ray and optical data with observations from XMM-Newton and Chandra to investigate the lightcurves and the spectra of the outburst, thereby identifying the source types.Results. The outburst of XMMU J004215.8+411924 lasted about one month. The source had a hard power-law spectrum with a photon index of 1.6. It was previously identified as a Be/X-ray binary based on the optical identification with a star. However, we show that, with improved source coordinates it is clear that the optical source is not the counterpart to the X-ray source. The source SWIFT J004217.3+411532 had a bright outburst, after which it slowly decayed over half a year. The spectrum was soft, corresponding to a thermal accretion disc with an innermost temperature of similar to 250-600 eV. The source was not seen in the optical, and the soft spectrum indicates that the source is most likely a black-hole low-mass X-ray binary. M31N 2006-11a is a nova that was previously observed in the optical. We detected it both in X-rays and UV with Swift similar to half a year after the optical maximum, after which it decayed below the Swift detection threshold within a month. The spectrum of the X-ray transient can be modelled by a black-body with a temperature of 50 eV. We use catalogues of X-ray transients in M 31 to estimate their rate, and we find a lower limit of 9 yr(-1).									9	0	0	0	0	9			0004-6361			WOS:000259601500031		
J	Waldron, Jayme L.; Welch, Shane M.; Bennett, Stephen H.								Vegetation structure and the habitat specificity of a declining North American reptile: A remnant of former landscapes								BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION				141	10			2477	2482		10.1016/j.biocon.2008.07.008			OCT 2008	2008	Although all species provide some spatial information about past environments, remnant populations of habitat specialists can serve as biological legacies and natural archives of historical landscapes. The endangered longleaf pine ecosystem is home to an array of imperiled fauna that specialize on the habitat. Often referred to as pine savanna, the ecosystem was characterized by longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), but included an array of open-canopy habitats within a grassland matrix dominated by a variety of tree species. In this study, we used a coarse scale of description to quantify habitat associations of a declining reptile, the eastern diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus adamanteus), historically associated with pine savannas of the southeastern United States. We made cross-scale habitat comparisons and controlled for land use and geographic variability. Habitat models of within home range and microhabitat selection indicated that the species was associated with an open-canopy savanna community structure. We identified the eastern diamondback rattlesnake as a remnant of the historical southeastern savanna, which is important for species conservation and broader management of the southeastern savanna community. Given their longevity and habitat specificity, remnant eastern diamondback rattlesnake populations are biological legacies of the southeastern savanna community and act as a surrogate for the prioritization of land conservation. Thus, the species' presence provides spatial information that can be used by conservationists to identify habitats that have high restoration potential, and also increases the probability that other species associated with pine savanna occur locally.

J	Zhang, Changhong; Wen, Xuejun; Vyavahare, Naren R.; Boland, Thomas				Zhang, Changhong/F-8447-2012				Synthesis and characterization of biodegradable elastomeric polyurethane scaffolds fabricated by the inkjet technique								BIOMATERIALS				29	28			3781	3791		10.1016/j.biomaterials.2008.06.009			OCT 2008	2008	Biodegradable polyurethanes (PUs) were synthesized from methylene di-p-phenyl-diisocyanate (MDI), polycaprolactone diol (PCL-diol) and N,N-bis (2-hydorxyethyl)-2-aminoethane-sulfonic acid (BES), serving as a hard segment, soft segment and chain extender, respectively, MDI was chosen due to its reactivity and wide application in synthesis of biomedical polyurethanes due to its reactivity; PCL-diol was chosen because of its biodegradability: and BES was chosen because it allowed the introduction sulfonic acid groups onto the polymer chains. We evaluated the polyurethanes' degradation rate, mechanical properties, hydrophobicity, antithrombogenecity, and ability to support fibroblast cell attachment and growth by comparing with polymers having a 2,2-(methylimino)diethanol (MIDE) chain extender. Mechanical testing demonstrated that the PU containing BES has tensile strengths of about 17 MPa and elongations up to 400%, about three times the strength and four times the elongation than the MIDE based PUs. The polymers showed decreased in vitro degradation rates, lower glass transition temperature (T-g) and hydrophilicity possibly due to enhanced microphase separation. Preliminary cytocompatibility studies showed that all the PUs are non-toxic, but PU containing BES exhibited much lower cell attachment and proliferation than the MIDE chain extended polymers. An in vitro platelet adhesion assay showed lower platelet attachment on BES containing PU. Additionally, due to the existence of sulfonic acid groups, the BES extended PU became water soluble in basic condition and insoluble in acidic condition, a phenomenon that is reversible at pH value of 8.7, making this a pH sensitive polymer attractive for bioprinting applications. By adding acetic acid into an inkjet cartridge and printing it onto a PU solution with pH above 8.7, precision fabricated scaffolds can be obtained, suggesting that BES based PUs are promising candidates as synthetic inks used for customizable fabrication of tissue engineering scaffolds.

Synthesis and characterization of nano-hydroxyapatite rods/poly(L-lactide acid) composite scaffolds for bone tissue engineering								COMPOSITES PART A-APPLIED SCIENCE AND MANUFACTURING				39	10			1589	1596		10.1016/j.compositesa.2008.05.018			OCT 2008	2008	The aims of this work were synthesis of rod shaped nano-hydroxyapatite (nHAP) and fabrication of novel nano-hydroxyapatite/poly(L-lactide acid) (nHAP/PLLA) composite scaffold. In the first step, the identification and morphology of chemically synthesized nHAP particles were determined by XRD, EDX, FTIR and SEM analyses. The rod shaped nHAP particles with an average size of approximately 37-65 nm in width and 100-400 nm in length were found similar to natural bone apatite in terms of chemical composition and structural morphology. In the second step, nHAP and micro sized HAP (mHAP) particles were used to fabricate HAP filled PLLA (HAP/PLLA) composites scaffolds using thermally induced phase separation method. The porosity of scaffolds was up to 85.06% and their average macropore diameter was in the range of 64-175 mu m. MR and XRD analyses showed some molecular interactions and chemical linkages between HAP particles and PLLA matrix. The compressive strength of nanocomposite scaffolds could high up to 14.9 MPa while those of pure PLLA and microcomposite scaffolds were 1.79 and 13.68 MPa, respectively. The cell affinity and biocompatibility of the nanocomposite scaffold were found to be higher than those of pure PLLA and microcomposite scaffolds. Following the results, the newly developed nHAP/PLLA composite scaffold is comparable with cancellous bone in terms of microstructure and mechanical strength, so it may be considered for bone tissue engineering applications.

Calculations of diffusion in FCC binary alloys using on-the-fly kinetic Monte Carlo								COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE				43	4			608	615		10.1016/j.commatsci.2008.01.001			OCT 2008	2008	We present a systematic, microscopic approach to diffusion for intermetallic alloys using accelerated molecular dynamics. On-the-fly kinetic Monte Carlo is combined with an efficient saddlepoint search to find the saddlepoints exiting a valley, based on energetics from the embedded atom method. With this technique, we compute the tracer diffusivities, migration energies, short-range order and long-range order as a function of composition and temperature for examples of moderately ordered (Cu3Au), weakly ordered (Au-Ag) and weakly clustered (Cu-Ni) alloys. We find that away from any critical temperature, the calculations produce reliable results, but when critical behavior dominates the approach is overcome by critical fluctuations.

Type of bacterial starter culture, aging and fermentation effects on some characteristics of inoculated beef sausages								EUROPEAN FOOD RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY				227	6			1651	1661		10.1007/s00217-008-0889-8			OCT 2008	2008	Beef sausage mixes were inoculated with either Pediococcus acidilactici with Staphylococcus xylosus or P. acidilactici with S. carnosus, subdivided and then held for 0, 24, 48 or 72 h at 8-10 degrees C prior to fermentation. After aging (pre-fermentation holding), the mixes were fermented for 16 h ending at 41 degrees C. Moisture, protein and fat contents of all sausage mixes did not differ due to holding effects over all starter cultures. The pH of mixes followed the same pattern for all mixes, declining (p < 0.05) from approximately 5.8 to pH 5.2-5.3 at 72 h aging and to 4.4-4.5 after fermentation. Total acidity of the mixes followed an inverse pattern to pH, increasing (p < 0.05) after fermentation although there was no effect due to type of starter culture. Aging had no effect on nonprotein nitrogen (NPN) content as Delta NPN among all cultures. After fermentation, however, sausages held 72 h and inoculated with S. carnosus had higher NPN contents compared to P. acidilactici alone (p < 0.05) and with S. xylosus (p < 0.10). The same effects of starter cultures on changes in total amino acid concentration were observed. Concentrations of individual amino acids showed increases depending on pre-fermentation aging period (0 h versus 72 h) followed by fermentation.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1438-2377			WOS:000259189800009

The subtraction of this component is not easy because it varies during the night by as much as 100% and it is not homogeneous over the sky. A program aimed at measuring and understanding the main characteristics of the atmospheric NIR emission was undertaken. A 512x512 CCD camera equipped with a RG780/2 mm filter is used to obtain images of the sky in a 36 degrees x36 degrees field of view. The intensities of a given star and of the nearby region devoid of star in a 439 arcmin(2) area are monitored during periods of time of several hours. The sky intensity measured in the 754-900 nm bandpass, reduced to zenith and zero airmass is comprised between mag20 and mag18.5 per arcsecond(2). A diminution by a factor of two during the night is frequently observed. Intensity fluctuations having an amplitude of 15% and periods of 5-40 min are present in the images with a structure of regularly spaced stripes. The fluctuations of the NIR sky background intensity are due to (1) the chemical evolution of the upper atmosphere composition during the night and (2) dynamical processes such as tides with periods of 3-6 h or gravity waves with periods of several tens of minutes. We suggest that a monitoring of the sky background intensity could be set up when quantitative observations of astronomical objects require exposure times longer than similar to 10 min.

Entamoeba histolytica: Lipid rafts are involved in adhesion of trophozoites to host extracellular matrix components								EXPERIMENTAL PARASITOLOGY				120	2			127	134		10.1016/j.exppara.2008.06.003			OCT 2008	2008	Adhesion is an important virulence function for Entamoeba histolytica, the causative agent of amoebic dysentery. Lipid rafts, cholesterol-rich domains, function in compartmentalization of cellular processes. In E. histolytica, rafts participate in parasite-host cell interactions; however, their role in parasite-host extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions has not been explored. Disruption of rafts with a cholesterol extracting agent, methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (M beta CD), resulted in inhibition of adhesion to collagen, and to a lesser extent, to fibronectin. Replenishment of cholesterol in M beta CD-treated cells, using a lipoprotein-cholesterol concentrate, restored adhesion to collagen. Confocal microscopy revealed enrichment of rafts at parasite-ECM interfaces. A raft-resident adhesin, the galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine-inhibitable lectin, mediates interaction to host cells by binding to galactose or N-acetylgalactosamine moieties on host glycoproteins. In this study, galactose inhibited adhesion to collagen, but not to fibronectin. Together these data suggest that rafts participate in E. histolytica-ECM interactions and that raft-associated Gal/GalNAc lectin may serve as a collagen receptor. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Sterile bologna samples were treated with solutions of nisin (2 mg/ml = 5000 AU/ml), lysozyme (10 mg/ml = 80 AU/ml) and a mixture of nisin and lysozyme (2 mg nisin+10 mg lysozyme/ml) before in-package pasteurization at 65 degrees C for 32 s. In-package pasteurization resulted in an immediate 3.5-4.2 log CFU/cm(2) reduction in L. monocytogenes population for all treatments. All pasteurized treatments also resulted in a significant reduction of L. monocytogenes by 12 weeks compared to un-pasteurized bologna. In-package pasteurization in combination with nisin or nisin-lysozyme treatments was effective in reducing the population below detectable levels by 2-3 weeks of storage. Results from this study could have a significant impact for the industry since a reduction in bacterial population was achieved by a relatively short pasteurization time and antimicrobials reduced populations further during refrigerated storage.

Tumor cells expressing a fusion protein of MULT1 and Fas are rejected in vivo by apoptosis and NK cell activation								GENE THERAPY				15	19			1302	1310		10.1038/gt.2008.77			OCT 2008	2008	Tumor cells evade immunosurveillance by elements of the innate immune system, such as natural killer (NK) cells, by downregulating or 'shedding' certain cell-surface molecules like mouse UL16-binding protein-like transcript 1 (MULT1) that can activate NK cells through NK cell receptors such as NKG2D; they also avoid Fas-mediated apoptosis by downregulating its expression. In the present study we report the design and evaluation of the antitumor activity of a novel fusion protein, MULT1E/FasTI, consisting of the extracellular domain of MULT1 and the transmembrane and intracellular domains of Fas. The fusion construct (pMULT1E/FasTI) was transfected into the mouse pulmonary carcinoma cell line TC-1; and stable cell clones expressing the fusion protein were established. In-vitro cell culture studies demonstrated that the binding of the NKG2D/Fc, a recombinant protein of mouse NK cell receptor, to MULT1E/FasTI expressed on tumor cells was able to elicit apoptosis as assayed by Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate staining and caspase-3 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and to activate NKG2D-expressing cells, such as NK cells. In-vivo subcutaneous tumor studies demonstrated that tumor cells expressing MULT1E/FasTI grew significantly slower than cells without the protein. Pulmonary metastasis studies showed that most of the mice completely rejected tumor cells expressing MULT1E/FasTI. This approach may generate a new therapeutic agent for tumor treatment when combined with tumor cell-specific gene delivery vehicles such as oncolytic adenovirus vectors.									5	0	0	5	0	5			0969-7128			WOS:000259222500002	18463688

J	Davis, Angela R.; Perkins-Veazie, Penelope; Hassell, Richard; Levi, Amnon; King, Stephen R.; Zhang, Xingping								Grafting effects on vegetable quality								HORTSCIENCE				43	6			1670	1672					OCT 2008	2008	Vegetable grafting began in the 1920s using resistant rootstock to control soilborne diseases. This process is now common in Asia, parts of Europe, and the Middle East. In Japan and Korea, most of the cucurbits and tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) grown are grafted. This practice is rare in the United States, and there have been few experiments to determine optimal grafting production practices for different geographical and climatic regions in America. This is beginning to change as a result of the phase out of methyl bromide. The U.S. cucurbit and tomato industries are evaluating grafting as a viable option for disease control. Because reports indicate that type of rootstock alters yield and quality attributes of the scion fruit, some seed companies are investigating grafting as a means to improve quality. It has been reported that pH, flavor, sugar, color, carotenoid content, and texture can be affected by grafting and the type of rootstock used. Reports vary on whether grafting effects are advantageous or deleterious, but it is usually agreed that the rootstock/scion combination must be carefully chosen for optimal fruit quality. Additionally, it is important to study rootstock/scion combinations under multiple climatic and geographic conditions because many rootstocks have optimal temperature and moisture ranges. This report gives an overview of the effect of grafting on vegetable quality.

In a multiyear and multicultivar study carried out ill South Carolina (2005 and 2006) and California (2006), we examined the potential influence of the QoI fungicide pyraclostrobin on antioxidant activity and commercially important peach (Prunus persica) fruit quality attributes, including fruit size, coloration, firmness, soluble solids concentration, and yield. Experimental orchards were sprayed according to commercial guidelines to manage insect pests and diseases. A pyraclostrobin + boscalid mixture was applied up to five times per season starting I week after the physiological stage of "shuck off" until 1 to 2 weeks before harvest. Fruit size was measured weekly between shuck off" and harvest, whereas the other fruit quality attributes were determined at harvest. Results indicate no consistent impact of the pyraclostrobin + boscalid mixture on same-year fruit size development or other fruit quality attributes in orchards with no or very little disease pressure. To our knowledge, this is the first in-depth evaluation of the potential effects of a Qol fungicide on commercially important tree fruit quality attributes.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1063-0198			WOS:000259516800021

Until recently, there has been little evidence for more than one gene encoding each of the two major spidroin silk proteins, MaSp1 and MaSp2. Here, we report the deduced N-terminal domain sequences for two distinct MaSp1 genes from Nephila clavipes (MaSp1A and MaSp1B) and for MaSp2. All three MaSp genes are co-expressed in the major ampullate gland. A search of the GenBank database also revealed two distinct MaSp1 C-terminal domain sequences. Sequencing confirmed that both MaSp1 genes are present in all seven Nephila clavipes spiders examined. The presence of nucleotide polymorphisms in these genes confirmed that MaSp1A and MaSp1B are distinct genetic loci and not merely alleles of the same gene. We experimentally determined the transcription start sites for all three MaSp genes and established preliminary pairing between the two MaSp1 N- and C-terminal domains. Phylogenetic analysis of these new sequences and other published MaSp N- and C-terminal domain sequences illustrated that duplications of MaSp genes may be widespread among spider species.									24	1	0	20	0	24			0962-1075			WOS:000259270400002	18828837

Small changes in land use result in changes in physical and chemical characteristics in the stream, which significantly alter biotic integrity. The objective of this study was to quantify the mechanisms of aquatic ecosystem degradation in streams impacted by watershed urbanization. By quantifying the development level and the changes in the physical parameters of receiving streams, the effects of land use change can be illustrated in a conceptual model and evaluated using a traditional ecological risk assessment framework. Three 1st-order streams draining catchments undergoing varying stages of land development were examined in the upper Piedmont physiographic province of South Carolina, USA. A disturbance index was developed to quantify the changes in land use on a monthly basis. This normalized disturbance index (NDI) was quantitatively linked to an increase in the percentage of impervious cover, stormwater runoff, storm-event total suspended solid (TSS) concentrations, and the North Carolina biotic index (NCBI). The NIDI was inversely related to a decline in habitat, median bed-sediment particle size, and benthic index of biotic integrity (BIBI). Unlike the percentage of impervious cover, the NDI facilitated the development of strategies for multiple scales of regulation. Predictive multivariate regressions were developed for storm-event TSS concentrations, the BIBI, and the NCBI. These regressions can be used to develop improved regulations for the effects of development and can lead to better implementation of best management practices, improved monitoring of land use change, and more sustainable development.									6	1	0	5	0	6			1551-3777	1551-3793		BCI:BCI200800663857	18605810

Non-linear vibrations of parametrically excited cantilever beams subjected to non-linear delayed-feedback control								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NON-LINEAR MECHANICS				43	8			801	812		10.1016/j.ijnonlinmec.2008.04.010			OCT 2008	2008	Non-linear feedback control provides ail effective methodology for vibration mitigation in non-linear dynamic systems. However, within digital circuits, actuation mechanisms, filters, and controller processing time, intrinsic time-delays unavoidably bring an unacceptable and possibly detrimental delay period between the controller input and real-time system actuation. If not well-studied, these inherent and compounding delays may inadvertently channel energy into or out of a system at incorrect time intervals, producing instabilities and rendering controllers' performance ineffective. In this work, we present a comprehensive investigation of the effect of time delays oil the non-linear control of parametrically excited cantilever beams. More specifically, we examine three non-linear cubic delayed-feedback control methodologies: position, velocity, and acceleration delayed feedback. Utilizing the method of multiple scales, we derive the modulation equations that govern the non-linear dynamics of the beam. These equations are then utilized to investigate the effect of time delays on the stability, amplitude, and frequency-response behavior. We show that, when manifested in the feedback, even the minute amount of delays can completely alter the behavior and stability of the parametrically excited beam, leading to unexpected behavior and responses that could puzzle researchers if not well-Understood and documented.

J	Park, Jong Sik; Jang, Wang Jin; Lee, Seong Beom; Park, Chanseok								Acquisition model for 3D shape measurement data								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRECISION ENGINEERING AND MANUFACTURING				9	4			16	21					OCT 2008	2008	The demand for three-dimensional (3D) shape measurements is increasing in a variety of fields, including the manufacture of molds and dies. The most popular technology for 3D shape measurement is the coordinate measuring machine (CMM) with a contact trigger probe. Although a CMM provides a high degree of accuracy, it is inefficient due to its long measuring time. It also has difficulty measuring soft objects that can be deformed by the touch of the contact probe. In addition, a CMM cannot digitize areas that are difficult to reach, and cannot capture very minute details on the surface of complex parts. For these reasons, optical non-contact measurement techniques are receiving more attention since they eliminate most of the problems associated with contact methods. Laser scanning is emerging as one of the more promising non-contact measurement techniques. This paper describes various acquisition considerations for laser scanning, including the accuracy of the 3D scan data, which depends on the charge-coupled device (CCD) gain and noise. The CCD gain and noise of a 3D laser scanner are varied while keeping the other conditions constant, and the measurement results are compared to the dimensions of a standard model. The experimental results show that a considerable time savings and an optimum degree of accuracy are possible by selecting the proper CCD gain and noise.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1229-8557			WOS:000259673200003

Many firms face problems such as order over-commitment and inability to fulfill committed orders. Addressing shortcomings in the state-of-the-practice, we developed a protocol based upon the distributed database two-phase commit protocol that guarantees the atomicity of global transactions. We developed extensions of the basic protocol based on requirements of experienced supply chain professionals. Supply chain managers experienced with order promising evaluated the protocol. They opined that adoption of this protocol would reduce the decision-making time by 80%, enhance the accuracy by 30% and also improve customer service levels. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In the Piedmont region of South Carolina, there is a documented problem with L. humile invading the campsites of state park campgrounds. While some parks have tried to implement proactive control programs, the most widely used tactic is spraying insecticides when L. humile populations become intolerable and visitors complain. For this study, a series of four trials were conducted to evaluate insecticidal spray treatments versus combinations of insecticidal sprays and granular bait. Control areas were set up to evaluate the change in ant foraging numbers over a season without chemical interference. One bait (Niban (R) Granular Bait) and three insecticidal sprays (Premise (R) 2, Temprid (TM) SC, and Tempo (R) Ultra SC) were evaluated to determine the best option in a park setting. The granular bait did not perform as well as the liquid insecticides. Temprid (TM) SC and Tempo (R) Ultra SC both resulted in a decrease in L. humile over the four-week period that was not significantly different. Although both insecticides were comparable in results, we found Tempo (R) Ultra SC to be the best choice in this study due to its lower cost and lower toxicity to non-target organisms. Assessing different methods of chemical management will enhance future efforts at sustainable control of L. humile in campground environments.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1523-5475			WOS:000207786400001

In the case of LdMNPV, Congo red reduced the median lethal concentration (LC50) by approximately 26-fold, whereas Tinopal LPW reduced the LC50 by approximately 360-fold. In tests using late second-stage larvae treated with LdCPV, LC(50)s were reduced by approximately 12-fold and approximately 430-fold by Congo red and Tinopal LPW, respectively. Fourth instar larvae were challenged with LdMNPV/water, LdMNPV/Congo red, and LdMNPV/Tinopal LPW and the activities of progeny virus from all treatments were similar.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1523-5475			WOS:000207786400002

Social influence and pain response in women and men								JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE				31	5			413	420		10.1007/s10865-008-9163-6			OCT 2008	2008	The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of social influence on responses to acute pain in women and men in a randomized experimental design. Sixty-eight undergraduates (32 women; 36 men) were randomly assigned to perform a cold pressor task either alone or in the presence of a same-sex friend. Expressions of pain were assessed with the short form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire. Overall social support was measured using the Krause social support assessment scale. The presence of a same-sex friend significantly increased pain reports in women, but not in men. Persons who reported high levels of social support on the Krause scale also reported greater cold pressor pain. Results suggest that the presence of a friend can increase pain report to an acute laboratory pain stimulus in women. These findings are consistent with models of social reinforcement in chronic pain syndromes.									21	1	0	8	0	22			0160-7715			WOS:000259249200005	18587638

The hydrothermal synthesis, solubility and crystal growth of YVO4 and Nd:YVO4								JOURNAL OF CRYSTAL GROWTH				310	20			4472	4476		10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2008.06.067			OCT 1 2008	2008	In this paper we report the synthesis, solubility and growth of large YVO4 and Nd:YVO4 transparent single crystals in aqueous NaOH under hydrothermal conditions. YVO4 Crystals formed from hydrothermal spontaneous nucleation by (1) reaction Of Y2O3 and V2O5, (2) reaction of Y2O3 and Na3VO4 or (3) recrystallization of Czochralski-grown YVO4. Crystals synthesized by these hydrothermal methods were of good quality, exhibiting no signs of vanadium reduction. YVO4 was found to have a positive solubility coefficient from 375 to 500 degrees C in 2-6 M NaOH, as well as a positive dependence on mineralizer concentration. Single crystals of YVO4 and Nd:YVO4 were grown on YVO4 seeds using 2 M NaOH as a mineralizer and exhibited the expected tetragonal morphology. Growth rates between 0.097 and 0.13 mm/day were observed. Nd:YVO4 growth using temperatures of 450 degrees C in the dissolution zone and 410 degrees C in the growth zone produced a crystal 15 x 15 x 7 mm(3) in size after a 4-week growth period.

Specifically, we investigate the relations of ethnicity to female students' perceptions and experiences related to engineering, as well as their selection of and persistence in undergraduate engineering majors. An ethnically diverse sample of female engineering undergraduates at an urban research university completed an online survey and participated in semi-structured interviews. Results revealed that participants of all ethnicities perceived strong institutional and peer supports in this diverse learning environment. Additionally, differences in participants' perceived barriers for achieving engineering educational and career plans were found based on ethnicity and parental level of education.					37th Annual Frontiers in Education Conference37th Annual Frontiers in Education Conference	OCT 10-13, 2007OCT 10-13, 2007		Milwaukee, WIMilwaukee, WI	43	0	0	0	0	43			1069-4730			WOS:000267767900006

The authors show that these models impose an implicit constraint that can obscure the true role of the covariates in the analysis. They illustrate the problem by reconsidering the role of contemporaneous trading volume in explaining ARCH effects in daily stock returns. Once the constraint imposed in earlier research is relaxed, it is found that specifying volume as a covariate does little to diminish the importance of lagged squared returns in capturing the dynamics of volatility (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0270-7314			WOS:000259208400001

The calculated settlement, considered as the load in the context of reliability analyses in this paper, is compared with a tolerable settlement, considered as the resistance herein. The reliability of the adjacent building against "damage" (defined herein as the violation of serviceability requirements such as having intolerable settlement) is first analyzed and the probability of exceedance (i.e., exceeding the tolerable settlement) is calculated. Furthermore, as the excavation proceeds, observed settlement at the current excavation stage is used to update the prediction of settlement at subsequent stages, and the probability of exceedance is updated accordingly.									27	3	0	0	0	29			1090-0241			WOS:000259255000003

The analysis utilized bridge properties, stream cross-sectional and hydraulic data, local flood frequency equations, a one-dimensional steady river flow computer model (WSPRO), and procedures recommended by the FHwA for predicting abutment scour. A method was developed to identify the single stream-discharge at each bridge that can cause the abutment scour that was observed at 73 bridge abutments. Analysis of the results revealed that for one-third of the abutments in the sandy soil region of South Carolina, the flow rates required to produce the observed scour depths had return periods greater than 100 years. Although for bridges in the region dominated by clay soil, the return periods were significantly smaller than 100 years.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0733-9429			WOS:000259255500012

Development and verification of a meso-scale based dynamic material model for plain-woven single-ply ballistic fabric								JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE				43	18			6301	6323		10.1007/s10853-008-2893-6			OCT 2008	2008	A meso-scale unit-cell based continuum material constitutive model has been developed for plain-woven single-ply ballistic fabric materials. This model, due to its computational efficiency, is suitable for use in computational analyses of the ballistic-protection performance of multi-layer body-armor vests. The model utilizes the continuum-level in-plane and out-of-plane deformation-state of the material, an energy minimization procedure and a simple account of yarn slip to update the structure/architecture of the fabric unit cell. Forces and moments developed within the structural components of the unit cell are then used to compute the continuum-level stress state at the material points associated with the unit cell in question. The model is implemented in a user-material subroutine suitable for use within commercial finite-element programs. To validate the model, a series of transient non-linear dynamic analyses of the impact of a square-shaped fabric patch with a spherical projectile is carried out and the computed results compared with their counterparts obtained using a more traditional finite-element approach within which yarns and yarn weaving are modeled explicitly. The results obtained show that the material model provides a reasonably good description for the fabric deformation and fracture behavior under a variety of boundary conditions applied to fabric edges and under varying fictional conditions present at the yarn/yarn and projectile/fabric interfaces. In addition, the overall ballistic energy absorption capacity of the fabric as well as its yarn-strain energy, yarn-kinetic energy, and frictional sliding contributions are predicted with reasonable accuracy by the proposed material model for fabric.									15	0	0	0	0	15			0022-2461			WOS:000259928500038

We predicted that the positive relationship between merit pay raise size and OBSE would be stronger when pay-for-performance (PFP) perceptions were high and predicted further that this interaction would be stronger among older employees. As predicted, merit pay raises were not related to OBSE levels for younger employees, but, among older employees, larger merit raises increased OBSE when PFP perceptions were high and decreased OBSE when PFP perceptions were low. Implications of the study for merit pay theory and practice are addressed. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.									8	1	0	0	0	9			0894-3796			WOS:000260506000007

Optical characterization of the synthesized oxysulfide glasses has shown that the cut-off wavelength decreases with increasing oxygen content, and this has been correlated to results of Raman and infrared (IR) spectroscopies which show the formation of new oxysulfide structural Units. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis to probe the bonding environment of oxygen atoms in the oxysulfide glass network, has revealed the preferred formation of Ga-O and Ge-O bonds ill comparison to As-O bonds. This work has demonstrated that melting a ChG glass with GeO2 leads to the formation of new oxysulfide glassy materials. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Small sugar acetates are known to be extraordinarily CO2-philic, but cellulose triacetate, a crystalline high molecule weight polymer is CO2 insoluble. Therefore, an amorphous high molecular weight polymer with pendant sugar acetates was synthesized. This polymer, poly(1-O-(vinyloxy) ethyl-2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside, P(AcGlcVE), was indeed CO2-soluble, however cloud point pressures of P(AcGlcVE) at 5 wt% polymer and 298 K were greater than that required for the dissolution of PVAc. Finally, the solubility of amorphous poly(lactic acid), PLA, was determined over a wide range of molecular weight. The corresponding cloud point pressures were much greater than either PVAc or P(AcGlcVE). Ab initio calculations for the CO2/PVAc dimer and CO2/PLA dimer mixtures were conducted in an attempt to elucidate the dramatic differences in the cloud point values of PVAc and PLA. Our calculations indicate that there is little difference in the average interaction energies for the CO2/PLA and the CO2/IPA systems. The only indication that PVAc would be expected to be more CO2-soluble that PLA was that the vinyl acetate dimer has binding modes that will readily accept multiple CO2 molecules, whereas the binding modes for the lactic acid dimer can apparently only accommodate a single CO2 molecule at a time.

By carefully controlling the reaction conditions, such as growth time and concentration of the AgNO(3) solution, the size, thickness, and surface roughness of the individual Ag nanoplates can be tuned in order to produce different topographic structures and roughness of the composite surfaces, which in turn influences the hydrophobicity of the surfaces. The as-synthesized composite surfaces have been found to exhibit various levels of hydrophobicity and different wetting states such as the Wenzel wetting state, Cassie impregnating wetting state, and Cassie nonwetting state. The relationship between surface structure and hydrophobic state is also discussed.									13	1	0	0	0	14			1998-0124			WOS:000207467300003

Fred Hoyle, primary nucleosynthesis and radioactivity								NEW ASTRONOMY REVIEWS				52	7-10			360	363		10.1016/j.newar.2008.05.007			OCT 2008	2008	Primary nucleosynthesis is defined as that which occurs efficiently in stars born of only H and He. It is responsible not only for increasing the metallicity of the galaxy but also for the most abundant gamma-ray-line emitters. Astrophysicists have inappropriately cited early work in this regard. The heavily cited (BFH)-F-2 paper (Burbidge et al., 1957) did not effectively address primary nucleosynthesis whereas Hoyle (Hoyle, 1954) had done so quite thoroughly in his infrequently cited 1954 paper. Even (BFH)-F-2 with Hoyle as coauthor seems strangely to not have appreciated what Hoyle (Hoyle, 1954) had achieved. I speculate that Hoyle must not have thoroughly proofread the draft written in 1956 by E.M. and G.R. Burbidge. The clear roadmap of primary nucleosynthesis advanced in 1954 by Hoyle describes the synthesis yielding the most abundant of the radioactive isotopes for astronomy. although that aspect was unrealized at the time. Secondary nucleosynthesis has also produced many observable radioactive nuclei, including the first gamma-ray-line emitter to be discovered in the galaxy and several others within stardust grains. Primary gamma-ray emitters would have been even more detectable in the early galaxy, when the birth rate of massive stars was greater; but secondary emitters, such as 26Al, would have been produced with smaller yield then owing to smaller abundance of seed nuclei from which to create them.

It will be capable of imaging gamma rays in the energy range from roughly 200 keV up to at least 50 MeV via Compton scattering and pair creation.GRIPS will also provide unprecedented sensitivities for nuclear-line science. With a field-of-view of roughly 50 degrees HWHM, energy resolutions of similar to 5% FWHM at 511 keV and similar to 2% at 1809 keV, angular resolutions of 3.3 degrees at 511 keV and 1.4 degrees at 1809 keV, and effective areas after background cuts of similar to 450 cm(2) at 511 keV and similar to 200 cm(2) at 1809 keV, GRIPS will achieve all-sky narrow-line point-source sensitivities of 9 x 10(-6) ph/cm(2)/s for 511 keV and 4 x 10(-7) ph/cm(2)/s at 1809 keV after five years mission time.

Population synthesis models for Al-29 production in starforming regions								NEW ASTRONOMY REVIEWS				52	7-10			436	439		10.1016/j.newar.2008.06.022			OCT 2008	2008	The Orion region hosts one of the closest associations of recent massive-star formation. Measurements of the 1809 keV emission from this region by the COMPTEL observatory shows an interesting offset of the Al-26 emission from the massive stars that are believed to be the source of the Al-26, and the emission appears rather extended. This suggests that the radioactive material flows from the stellar associations into the nearby Eridanus cavity, and this provides a unique possibility to study the properties of massive stars and their interactions with their surroundings, as well as the properties of the turbulent ISM in the vicinity of OB associations. We model this region with a population synthesis code. and take the geometry of the region into account. This study also bears on the larger theme of galactic chemo dynamics (GCD), as the winds and supernova ejecta of massive stars provide the essential chemical and energetic feedback mechanisms responsible for the formation and evolution of galaxies.

Probing cosmic chemical evolution with GRBs								NEW ASTRONOMY REVIEWS				52	7-10			450	453		10.1016/j.newar.2008.06.028			OCT 2008	2008	The association of long-duration Gamma Ray Bursts with the final stages of the evolution of massive stars has been established with photometry, via late "bumps" in their optical afterglows, and several cases of direct spectroscopic evidence. The link to massive stars offers their bright afterglow emission as a perfect tool for absorption line spectroscopy of their host galaxy environments and any material along their lines of sight. With typical redshifts of z similar to 2, and a present record of z = 6.3, it is clear that their afterglows offer a very powerful tool to probe cosmic chemical evolution, to the earliest epochs of star formation, to the epoch of reionization by population III stars and accretion onto rapidly growing black holes. Fast afterglow decline does require a rapid response with very sensitive spectrometers on large aperture telescopes, which is a challenge for current astronomical resources - but rewards are correspondingly high.

Input-shaping control of nonlinear MEMS								NONLINEAR DYNAMICS				54	1-2			167	179		10.1007/s11071-007-9246-x			OCT 2008	2008	We develop a new technique for preshaping input commands to control microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). In general, MEMS are excited using an electrostatic field which is a nonlinear function of the states and the input voltage. Due to the nonlinearity, the frequency of the device response to a step input depends on the input magnitude. Therefore, traditional shaping techniques which are based on linear theory fail to provide good performance over the whole input range. The technique we propose combines the equations describing the static response of the device, an energy balance argument, and an approximate nonlinear analytical solution of the device response to preshape the voltage commands. As an example, we consider set-point stabilization of an electrostatically actuated torsional micromirror. The shaped commands are applied to drive the micromirror to a desired tilt angle with zero residual vibrations. Simulations show that fast mirror switching operation with almost zero overshoot can be realized using this technique. The proposed methodology accounts for the energy of the significant higher modes and can be used to shape input commands applied to other nonlinear micro- and macro-systems.									26	0	0	1	0	26			0924-090X	1573-269X		WOS:000258657600012		
J	Pardue, Erin L; Ibrahim, Samir; Ramamurthi, Anand								Role of hyaluronan in angiogenesis and its utility to angiogenic tissue engineering.								Organogenesis				4	4			203	14					2008-Oct	2008	Angiogenesis represents the outgrowth of new blood vessels from existing ones, a physiologic process that is vital to supply nourishment to newly forming tissues during development and tissue remodeling and repair (wound healing). Regulation of angiogenesis in the healthy body occurs through a fine balance of angiogenesis-stimulating factors and angiogenesis inhibitors. When this balance is disturbed, excessive or deficient angiogenesis can result and contribute to development of a wide variety of pathological conditions. The therapeutic stimulation or suppression of angiogenesis could be the key to abrogating these diseases. In recent years, tissue engineering has emerged as a promising technology for regenerating tissues or organs that are diseased beyond repair. Among the critical challenges that deter the practical realization of the vision of regenerating functional tissues for clinical implantation, is how tissues of finite size can be regenerated and maintained viable in the long-term. Since the diffusion of nutrients and essential gases to cells, and removal of metabolic wastes is typically limited to a depth of 150-250 microm from a capillary (3-10 cells thick), tissue constructs must mandatorily permit in-growth of a blood capillary network to nourish and sustain the viability of cells within. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the role and significance of hyaluronan (HA), a glycosaminoglycan (GAG) component of connective tissues, in physiologic and pathological angiogenesis, its applicability as a therapeutic to stimulate or suppress angiogenesis in situ within necrotic tissues in vivo, and the factors determining its potential utility as a pro-angiogenic stimulus that will enable tissue engineering of neo-vascularized and functional tissue constructs for clinical use.									46	1	1	33	1	49			1547-6278			MEDLINE:19337400	19337400

The energy and crystal momentum conservation rules in two- and one-dimensional crystals lead to a drastic reduction of the phase space available for anharmonic phonon decay. This is illustrated with first principles calculations of the anharmonic properties of graphite and graphene. Experimental Raman linewidth data for the Radial Breathing Mode (RBM) in suspended single-walled carbon nanotubes are also interpreted in terms of a simple model in which a phonon decay bottleneck induced by the low dimensionality leads to a population time dependence in which a fast initial decay is followed by a slow decay determined by the decay rate of a large population of secondary phonons. These results are key to understanding the combined dynamics of electrons and phonons that determines the electrical transport properties in low-dimensional carbon nanostructures. In the case of the RBM in carbon nanotubes, they raise the intriguing possibility of using the linewidth of the Raman peak to determine the, chirality of the nanotube.

The theory gives rise to a quantum-mechanical limit for ordered surfaces that describes coherent diffraction peaks whose thermal attenuation is governed by a Debye-Waller factor, however, this Debye-Waller factor has values much larger than would be calculated using simple models. A classical limit for incoherent scattering is obtained for high energies and temperatures. Between these limiting classical and quantum cases is another regime in which diffraction features appear that are broadened by the motion in the fast direction of the scattered beam but whose intensity is not governed by a Debye-Waller factor. All of these limits appear to be accessible within the range of currently available experimental conditions.									38	0	0	0	0	38			1098-0121			WOS:000260574400116

We identify the Goldstone modes of the conical cycloidal order and deduce their dispersion relations whose signature anisotropy in momentum space reflects the symmetries broken by the ordered state. We discuss the soft polarization fluctuations, the "electromagnons," associated with these magnetic modes and make several experimental predictions which can be tested in neutron-scattering and optical experiments.									8	0	0	1	0	8			1098-0121			WOS:000260574300068

We discuss the case when this order coexists with ferromagnetism in a so-called "conical cycloid" state and show that a direct transition to this state from the ferromagnet is necessarily first order. On quite general grounds, the reversal of the direction of the uniform magnetization in this state can lead to the reversal of the electric polarization as well without the need to invoke "toroidal moment" as the order parameter.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1098-0121			WOS:000260574300067

We propose an ablation electrode array consisting of 4 - 8 blade shaped electrodes arranged in a circular geometry for the treatment of large liver tumors. We developed a 3D code based on the finite difference method for evaluating the effect of different numbers of electrodes (4, 6 and 8) and electrode distance on lesion size. The configuration with six electrodes can ablate a volume of 70 x 70 x 40 mm(3) in approximately 5 min, with tissue temperature above 50 degrees C throughout the treatment volume. We then performed an experimental study in polyacrylamide gel in order to validate the theoretical results. The average temperature error between the simulation and the experiment was 3.8% at the center of the electrode array. This study shows that the proposed device potentially allows more rapid treatment of large tumors than current radiofrequency ablation devices.									3	0	0	1	0	3			0967-3334			WOS:000259693900009	18812644

A new stereo-imaging method is applied that not only measures the altitude of the airglow layer but also provides a three-dimensional map of the OH-layer centroid heights. A campaign was conducted in July 2006 in Peru to obtain NIR images of the OH nightglow layer which were simultaneously taken for two sites separated by 645 km: Cerro Cosmos (12 degrees 09'08.2"S, 75 degrees 33'49.3"W, altitude 4630 m) and Cerro Verde Tellolo (16 degrees 33'17.6"S, 71 degrees 39'59.4"W, altitude 2330 m). Data represented by pairs of images obtained during the nights of July 26-27 and 28-29 are analyzed to yield satellite-type views of the wave field. These are obtained by application of an inversion algorithm. In calculating the normalized cross-correlation parameter for the intensity, three-dimensional maps of the OH nightglow layer surface are retrieved. The mean altitude of the emission profile barycenter is found to be at 87.1 km on July 26 and 89.5 km on July 28. In these two cases the horizontal wavelengths determined are 21.1 and 24.6 km with periods of 18 and 34 min, respectively. A panoramic view of the OH nightglow emission obtained on July 29 at 8 h51-9 h26 UT is presented, in which the overall direction of the waves is found to be N-NW to S-SE, azimuth 150 degrees-330 degrees (counted from South). The wave kinetic energy density at the OH nightglow layer altitude is 3.9 x 10(-4) W/kg, which is comparable to the values derived from partial reflection radiowave data. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Control birds received sham inoculations at 10 wk of age. Birds in a second treatment group were inoculated with 6/85MG at 10 wk of age, those in a third treatment group were inoculated with 6/85MG at 10 wk followed by an overlay inoculation of FMG at 22 wk, and those in a fourth treatment group were inoculated with 6/85MG at 10 wk followed by an overlay inoculation of FMG at 45 wk. Parameters investigated at 24, 32, 43, and 47 wk were hematocrit, plasma total protein, and serum calcium, triglycerides, and cholesterol. No significant treatment effects were noted for hematocrit, serum triglycerides, or serum cholesterol. However, at wk 32, plasma protein was greater in birds that received 6/85MG at 10 wk or 6/85MG at 10 wk and FMG at 22 wk in comparison to controls. Also, at wk 47, serum calcium concentration was greater in birds that received 6/85MG at 10 wk and FMG at 45 wk compared with controls and those that received 6/85MG at 10 wk and FMG at 22 wk. These results suggest that the prelay inoculation of pullets with 6/85MG may subsequently elevate plasma protein, and in conjunction with an FMG overlay at 45 wk, may increase serum calcium concentrations in laying hens.									7	0	0	6	0	7			0032-5791			WOS:000259403000011	18809862

Our collection records add six new host associations to the known information for L. oppositus (bald cypress, trumpet creeper, American beautyberry, sunflower, tuliptree, and red Mulberry) and corroborate published observations of this species oil catalpa, jimsonweed, pecan, and tomato. Breeding hosts range from annual crops to vines, shrubs', and trees, and include gymnosperms, monocots and dicots from 15 families. Adding adult records to this total yields 22 families and 29 genera as potential or actual food plants. Field observations, coupled with published accounts, indicate that nymphs are strongly associated with the presence of host reproductive Structures, although adults may be collected on host plants during non-fruiting periods. Overlap with congeners [e.g., L. phyllopus (L.), L.corculus (Say)] occurs on several host plant species. Like the leaffooted bug (L. phyllopus), L. oppositus appears to be a specialist on reproductive Structures but highly polyphagous.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0013-8797			WOS:000261227300013

Escobilla butterflybush, Buddleja scordioides Kunth (Scrophulariaceae), is newly recorded as the host of L. personatus in western (Trans-Pecos) Texas, and new Texas records are given for this seldom-collected mirid. New distribution records also are given for H. antennata in western Texas, in addition to its occurrence on ceniza, Leucophyllum frutescens (Berl.) I.M. Johnston (Scrophulariaceae). Scanning electron micrographs of the antennal setae of L. personatus are provided; included for both mirid species are color photographs of their host plants and an adult on host foliage.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0013-8797			WOS:000261227300022

All 12 Old World species are considered immigrant (rather than intentionally introduced) in Newfoundland. Two mirid species native to North America-Deraeocoris piceicola Knight and D. pinicola. Knight-also are reported as new to the island. All 14 hemipteran species were collected in the eastern Avalon Peninsula (13 were found at the major port city of St. John's) and were found mainly on Old World plants. The record of the mirid D. piceicola. is the first for eastern Canada, and that of the microphysid L. pselaphiformis represents the second for North America; this species was known previously only from Halifax, Nova Scotia. A summary of the previously recorded North American distributions and host-plant associations of the 14 species is provided.									1	0	0	2	0	2			0013-8797			WOS:000261227300023

A numerical investigation of the influence of yarn-level finite-element model on energy absorption by a flexible-fabric armour during ballistic impact								PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART L-JOURNAL OF MATERIALS-DESIGN AND APPLICATIONS				222	L4			259	276		10.1243/14644207JMDA209			OCT 2008	2008	A series of transient non-linear dynamic finite-element method (FEM) analyses pertaining to the interaction of a single-ply plain-woven balanced square textile-fabric armour with a spherical steel projectile is carried out in order to compare the corresponding results obtained for two different yarn models: (a) a solid FEM model in which the warp and weft yarns are represented using first-order three-dimensional solid elements and (b) a membrane model in which the same yarns are represented using second-order membrane elements. The analyses are carried out under different yarn-yarn and projectile-fabric frictional conditions and under different far-field boundary conditions applied to the edges of the fabric. The results obtained showed that the two sets of analyses yield comparable predictions regarding the temporal evolution and the spatial distribution of the deformation and damage fields within the fabric, regarding the ability of the fabric to absorb the projectile's kinetic energy and regarding the relative contributions of the main energy absorbing mechanisms. The work also confirmed the roles yarn-yarn and projectile-fabric friction play in the impact process as well as the effect of the far-field boundary conditions applied to the edges of the fabric.									20	0	0	0	0	20			1464-4207			WOS:000261435100005

Resilient Modulus Behavior of Rubberized Asphalt Concrete Mixtures Containing Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement								ROAD MATERIALS AND PAVEMENT DESIGN				9	4			633	649		10.3166/RMPD.9.633-649			OCT-DEC 2008	2008	The resilient modulus is the modulus to be used with the elastic theory during any analysis of a flexible pavement. It is well known that most paving materials (e.g., asphalt pavements) are not elastic but experience some permanent deformation after each load application: With respect to the complexity of the Rubberized Asphalt Concrete (RAC) containing Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP), the Indirect Tensile Strength (ITS) and resilient modulus evaluation of modified mixtures are important to understand. The aging of binder containing crumb rubber obviously alters the visco-elastic and plastic characteristics of the modified mixtures. The deformation of the mixture under repeated loading, nearly completely recoverable, should also be considered. The experimental design included the use of two-aggregate sources, one rubber type (ambient), four rubber contents (0%, 5%, 10%, and 15%), one crumb rubber size (-40 mesh [-0:425 mm]), and four RAP contents (0%, 15%, 25%, and 30%). The findings indicated that an increase in the rubber content in the modified mixture-leads. to a decrease in ITS and resilient modulus values regardless of rubber content, and this increase also improves the aging resistance and-increases the viscous characteristics of the modified binder. However, as RAP content increased, not only the viscosity and G*sin delta values of the modified binder increased, the ITS and resilient modulus values of the modified mixtures also increased.									10	0	0	0	0	10			1468-0629			WOS:000261694100004

Asphalt binders, modified and virgin alike are highly temperature sensitive materials; and to date not many research projects have been conducted establishing a relationship between rubber content and binder property changes due to temperature change. For this study relationships were established from a number of studies, where data was obtained from 28 binder types rising S binder grades and 11 sources. The rubber coefficient was found to be of particular importance and was seen to be-dependent on the nature of the rubber as well as the grinding procedure used to render it to crumb rubber. Rubber viscosity coefficient values are presented for each asphalt crumb-rubber combination. While all Crumb Rubber Modified (CRM) binder blends are unique, this study shows that they all exhibit similar trends when crumb rubber concentration, virgin properties, and temperature are varied.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1468-0629			WOS:000261694100009

Our non-dualistic metatheory rests on a distributed notion of agency. The kinds of morally imbued social practices that are identified by hermeneutic theorists constitute one level of agency. At the first level of agency, persons are already committed, at least by implication, to folk psychologies that cover positive emotion, positive traits, and positive institutions. Higher levels of agency and knowing emerge through the process of development. The higher knowing levels incorporate the capacity for conscious self-reflexive awareness, which permits the person to consciously deliberate and form theories of the good person and the good life. These more consciously formed positive folk psychologies are always in a dialectical relationship with the more implicit and embodied understandings of the good life as manifested in social practices, emotional experiences, and habitual thoughts. We suggest that this framework helps to account for the 'diversity of goods' that underlie our lives and to clarify the relationship that the professional positive psychologist will have with his or her native folk psychology.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0959-3543			WOS:000259256200007

The resulting HICF assembly contained 2,138 contigs composed of 15,655 clones (4.3x peach genome equivalents) from two complementary bacterial artificial chromosome libraries. The total physical length of all contigs is estimated at 303 Mb or 104.5% of the peach genome. The framework physical map is anchored on the Prunus genetic reference map and integrated with the peach transcriptome map. The physical length of anchored contigs is estimated at 45.0 Mb or 15.5% of the genome. Altogether, 2,636 markers, i.e., genetic markers, peach unigene expressed sequence tags, and gene-specific and overgo probes, were incorporated into the physical framework and supported the accuracy of contig assembly.									45	4	0	46	1	52			1614-2942			WOS:000258548600013

In 2005, the highest reduction of live root crowns was observed where P. montana was covered for the entire growing season (May-October) with a reduction of 42% of live root crowns compared with the control plots. Where P. montana was covered for alternate weeks throughout the growing season live root crowns were reduced by 35%. Covering P. montana for one week and then uncovering for four weeks repeatedly through the season killed 24% of root crowns. In 2006, the second year of treatment to the same plots, the three solarization treatments had similar efficacy of about 97%. The use of polyethylene sheeting appears not to be cost-effective for general control of large P. montana infestations, but may be useful for small patches.									5	0	0	5	0	5			0043-1737			WOS:000259311500002

Weed-Control Systems for Peanut Grown as a Biofuel Feedstock								WEED TECHNOLOGY				22	4			584	590		10.1614/WT-07-179.1			OCT-DEC 2008	2008	Peanuts are not often used as a true oilseed crop, especially for the production of fuel. However, peanut could be a feedstock for biodiesel, especially in on-farm or small cooperative businesses, where producers can dictate the cost of making their own fuel. Field Studies were conducted in 2005 and 2006 to assess low-cost weed-control systems for peanuts that would facilitate the economic viability of peanut biodiesel. Four preselected herbicide costs ranging from $25 to $62/ha and two application timings were compared with nontreated ($0/ha) and typical ($115/ha) herbicide programs for weed control and peanut Oil yield. A peanut oil yield goal of 930 L/ha was exceeded with multiple low-cost herbicide systems in 3 of 4 site-yr. The main effect of application timing was only significant for a single site-year in which oil yield increased linearly with cost of the PRE and POST weed-control system. An herbicide cost of $50/ha, using PRE and POST applications, was consistently among the highest in oil yield, regardless of site-year, exceeding the typical (high value) programs in 3 of 4 site-yr. Use of reduced rates of imazapic (0.5 X or 0.035 kg ai/ha) was detrimental in 2 of 4 site-yr. Weed control, and thus oil yields, were most dependent on species present at each location and not on input price. Data from this series Of Studies will allow researchers and entrepreneurs to more accurately assess the viability and sustainability of peanut biodiesel.									3	0	0	2	0	5			0890-037X			WOS:000262239600004

The macrocyclic oxa thiacrowns 9S2O (1-oxa-4,7-dithiacyclononane) and 18S4O2 (1,10-dioxa-4,7,13,16-tetrathiacyclooctadecane) bind to Hg(II) to form distorted tetrahedral S4 geometries without coordination of the oxygen atoms. In contrast, the two macrocycles coordinate to Cd(II) through all ligand donors to form S4O2 environments. We also report the structure of bis(9N2S (1,4-diaza-7-thiacyclononane))cadmium(II), [Cd(9N2S)(2)](2+) which shows octahedral coordination in a trans N4S2 environment.

Predicting the growth of deciduous tree species in response to water stress: FVS-BGC model parameterization, application, and evaluation								ECOLOGICAL MODELLING				217	1-2			139	147		10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2008.06.007			SEP 24 2008	2008	An individual-tree, distance-independent forest stand projection model (FVS-BGC) was applied to study deciduous species response to water stress. FVS-BGC couples the process model STAND-BGC to the empirically based forest vegetation simulator (FVS). We sought to determine whether the hybrid model could be expanded to simulate deciduous trees and their response to water stress, where to date the model has not been used beyond coniferous trees. FVS-BGC was parameterized with comprehensive ecophysiological, site, and silvicultural data collected on Acer rubrum L. (A. rubrum), Paulownia elongata (P. elongata), Quercus nuttallii (Q. nuttallii), and Quercus phellos (Q. phellos). Species-specific carbon gain and growth were simulated under well-watered and water-stressed conditions. Simulations on species-specific bases allowed assessment of drought effects on stand production and the ability to test FVS-BGC's capability to predict the water stress responses of deciduous species. Under well-watered conditions, FVS-BGC height and caliper predictions were not statistically different from measured values for P. elongata, Q. nuttallii and Q. phellos. Under water stress, FVS-BGC accurately predicted height and caliper in Q. nuttallii and Q. phellos. For carbon sequestration, FVS-BGC predictions agreed with measured values on all study species under well-watered and water-stressed conditions. In general, the simulations showed that modelled height, caliper, and carbon sequestration were consistent with observed data. This study establishes the potential for FVS-BGC applications to include deciduous species-specific simulations and their respective water stress responses. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The Mg(2)Sn-rich grain boundary phase was selectively doped with La. It was found that the La doping dramatically increased the electrical conductivity to thermal conductivity ratio in the composites. As a result, a dimensionless figure of merit ZT similar to 0.81 has been attained at 810 K for the Mg(2-x)La(x)(Si, Sn) in situ composite with x = 0.005, significantly higher than the ZT similar to 0.18 at 540 K for the undoped composite and comparable to ZT similar to 0.8 of state-of-the-art PbTe intermediate temperature TE alloys.									48	3	0	1	0	49			0022-3727			WOS:000258985500012

Spectroscopic observations reveal the presence of absorption lines due to O I, Si II, and C IV, implying a likely redshift of z = 1.547. The well-sampled light curves, in particular from 0.5 to 4 days after the burst, suggest a jet break at 3.7 days, corresponding to a jet opening angle of similar to 7.0 degrees, and implying an intrinsic GRB energy in the 1-10,000 keV band of around E(gamma) = (6.3-6.9) x 10(51) ergs (based on the fluences measured by the gamma-ray detectors of the IPN). GRB 070125 is among the brightest afterglows observed to date. The SED implies a host extinction of A(V) < 0. 9 mag. Two rebrightening episodes are observed, one with excellent time coverage, showing an increase in flux of 56% in similar to 8000s. The evolution of the afterglow light curve is achromatic at all times. Late-time observations of the afterglow do not show evidence for emission from an underlying host galaxy or supernova. Any host galaxy would be subluminous, consistent with current GRB host galaxy samples. Evidence for strong Mg II absorption features is not found, which is perhaps surprising in view of the relatively high redshift of this burst and the high likelihood for such features along GRB-selected lines of sight.									17	0	0	1	0	17			0004-637X			WOS:000259314200030

The problem with this data is that they are subject to intentional manipulation, thus reducing their suitability for decision-making. A method of identifying manipulated data, digital analysis, addresses this problem at low cost. In this paper, we demonstrate how one uses this method in real-world companies to validate self-reported data from line workers. The results of our study suggest that digital analysis estimates the accuracy of employee reported data in operations management, within limited contexts. These findings lead to improved operating performance by providing a tool for practitioners to exclude inaccurate information. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The price for the good is market-dependent, and each market has an associated demand distribution, with parameters that depend on the amount of marketing effort applied. Given long procurement lead-times, the firm must decide which markets it will serve prior to procuring the good. We develop a profit maximizing model to address the firm's integrated market selection, marketing effort, and procurement decisions. The model implicitly accounts for inventory pooling across markets, which reduces safety stock costs but increases model complexity. The resulting model is a nonlinear integer optimization problem, for which we develop specialized solution methods. For the case in which budget constraints exist, we provide a novel solution approach that uses a tailored branch-and-bound algorithm. Our approach solves a broad range of 3000 test instances in an average of less than 2 seconds, significantly outperforming a leading commercial global optimization solver. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Field evaluation of the hydromechanical behavior of flat-lying fractures during slug tests								JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY				359	1-2			30	45		10.1016/j.jhydrol.2008.06.004			SEP 15 2008	2008	Slug tests were conducted at depths of 20-50 min a fractured gneiss and axial displacements were measured along the borehole with a portable extensometer in order to evaluate the feasibility of combining pressure and displacement measurements to improve the characterization of fractured rock. Displacements on the order of microns occurred during slug tests when maximum head changes were on the order of meters. Maximum displacement tagged behind the maximum head, and the signals at a given location were repeatable to within reasonable tolerances. Tests were conducted at 12 packed-off depth intervals in a borehole and the signals from each interval were distinctly different from those at other depths. Parameter estimation techniques were used with a hydromechanical model to interpret the field results, and the findings show that there are three transmissive zones in the borehole and the compliance of the fractures generally decreases with depth. The inversion also highlights the importance of considering heterogeneities in the vicinity of the well bore when interpreting hydromechanical tests. Zones of leakage and blockage in the fractures were predicted in the vicinity of the well bore, and their presence had a significant effect on the displacement signals. (C) 2008 Etsevier B.V.

[E. Strassburger, P. Patel, J.W. McCauley, C. Kovalchick, K.T. Ramesh, D.W. Templeton, Proceedings of the 23rd International Symposium on Ballistics, Spain, April, 2007; E. Strassburger, P. Patel, J.W. McCauley, D.W. Templeton, Proceedings of the 23rd International Symposium on Ballistics, Spain, April, 20071 in a series of edge-on-impact (EOI) tests and other open literature experimental findings are used to construct a (high strain-rate, high-pressure, large-strain) ballistic constitutive model for this material. The basic components of the model are constructed in such a way that the model is suitable for direct incorporation into typical transient non-linear dynamics finite element-based software packages like ANSYS/Autodyn [ANSYS/Autodyn version 11.0, User Documentation, Century Dynamics Inc. a subsidiary of ANSYS Inc., 2007] or ABAQUS/Explicit[ABAQUS version 6.7, User Documentation, Dessault Systems, 2007]. To validate the material model, a set of finite element analyses of EOI tests was carried out and the computational results compared with their experimental counterparts. It is found that front-shapes and propagation velocities of the longitudinal and transverse waves are quite well represented by the model. The same was found to be the case for front-shapes and propagation velocities of the "coherent-damage" zones but mainly at shorter post-impact times. Discrepancies at longer post-impact times are attributed to the effects of damage-promoting target-fixturing-induced stresses and cutting/grinding-induced flaws. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

J	Keskar, Gayatri; Elliott, Bevan; Gaillard, Jay; Skove, Malcolm J.; Rao, Apparao M.				Elliott, Bevan/C-4621-2011				Using electric actuation and detection of oscillations in microcantilevers for pressure measurements								SENSORS AND ACTUATORS A-PHYSICAL				147	1			203	209		10.1016/j.sna.2008.04.017			SEP 15 2008	2008	Response characteristics of a microcantilever, such as resonant frequency, amplitude, phase and quality factor, can be used for absolute pressure measurements in the range of 10(-4) to 10(3) Torr. To this end, it would be very convenient to have the resonance of the microcantilever actuated and detected electrostatically. Herein, we report the nonlinear dynamics of microcantilevers under varying pressure and different gases using the harmonic detection of resonance (HDR) technique IJ. Gaillard, M.J. Skove, R. Ciocan, A.M. Rao, Electrical detection of oscillations in microcantilevers and nanocantilevers, Rev. Sci. Instrum. 77 (2006) 073907]. The HDR technique exploits nonlinearities in the cantilever-counter electrode system to allow electrostatic actuation and detection of the responses of the microcantilever to the pressure and gas composition. In particular. the 2nd and 3rd harmonics of the measured charge on the cantilever are investigated. The microcantilever demonstrates a quality factor of similar to 10,000 at 10(-3) Torr, and a usable response in the range from 10(-3) to 10(3) Torr. The use of different harmonics can enable us to adjust the range of pressures over which the sensor has an efficacious response, enhancing its sensitivity to a particular environment. The experimental results are in reasonable agreement with theoretical calculations, despite the nonlinearities involved.

The results revealed that microwave heating was effective in producing a useful HA body in a very short sintering cycle without disrupting the HA phase stability. The maximum hardness of 7.21GPa and 6.38GPa was obtained ford HA sintered at 1050 degrees C by the conventional method and 1150 degrees C by microwave sintering, respectively. The maximum fracture toughness measured for the microwave-sintered and conventional-sintered HA was 1.45 MPam(1/2) at 1050 degrees C and 1.22 MPam(1/2) at 1000 degrees C, respectively. Although the relative density of microwave -sintered HA was slightly lower than the conventional - sintered HA throughout the sintering regime employed, taking into account of the heating and soaking periods, the time taken by microwave sintering to achieve a relative density of 96.5% was about 3% of the time consumed for samples sintered by the conventional heating. Microwave heating was found to be an effective technique to produce a useful HA body for clinical applications without causing grain coarsening. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

There are many problems associated with this paradigm, particularly during the in vitro manipulation process and the delivery and local retention of re-injected cells. An alternative paradigm that could be easier, safer, and more efficient, would involve attracting endogenous stem cells and precursor cells to the defect site for new tissue regeneration. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a pleiotropic cytokine of mesenchymal origin, exerts a strong chemoattractive effect on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and neural stem cells (NSCs), and induces migration of MSCs in vitro. However, HGF undergoes rapid proteolysis in vivo, which results in a very short lifetime of the bioactive cytokine. To maintain the therapeutic level of HGF at the defect site necessary for endogenous stem cell recruitment, sustained, long-term, and localized delivery of HGF is required. Thiol-modified glycosaminoglycans hyaluronan (HA) and heparin (HP), combined with modified gelatin (Gtn), have been crosslinked with poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) to afford semisynthetic ECM-like (sECM) hydrogels that can both provide controlled growth factor release and permit cell infiltration and proliferation. Herein we compare the use of different sECM compositions for controlled release of HGF and concomitant recruitment of human bone marrow MSCs into the scaffold in vitro.									39	5	0	22	0	43			1616-5187			WOS:000259533700005	18528846

Herein we report on the thermoelectric properties and microstructure of high performance Mg(2)Si(0.4-x)Sn(0.6)Sb(x) (0 <= x <= 0.015) alloys. The state-of-the-art ZT value of similar to 1.1 has been attained in the samples with x=0.0075 due to the relatively low thermal conductivity. In light of the simple cubic structure and mostly light constituent elements, the reduction in lattice thermal conductivity has been discussed in connection with a fairly large amount of in situ formed nanostructures in these samples.

Impact of WASDE Reports on Implied Volatility in Corn and Soybean Markets								AGRIBUSINESS				24	4			473	490		10.1002/agr.20174			FAL 2008	2008	This study investigates the impact of U.S. Department of Agriculture World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimate (WASDE) reports on implied volatility in corn and soybean markets over 1985 to 2002. If WASDE reports resolve uncertainty, implied volatility should drop immediately after release of the reports. Results show that WASDE reports lead to a statistically significant reduction of implied volatility that averages 0.7 percentage points for corn and 0.8 percentage points for soybeans. The magnitude of the reduction is largest for the group of WASDE reports containing both domestic and international situation and outlook information. This group of reports reduces implied volatility by an average of 1.1 percentage points in corn and by almost 1.5 percentage points in soybeans. Results also reveal that the market impact of WASDE reports is strongest in the most recent 1996 to 2002 subperiod. Overall, the results indicate that WASDE reports provide valuable information to corn and soybean market participants. [JEL classifications: Q100, Q110, Q130].

Molecular simulation of protein-surface interactions: Benefits, problems, solutions, and future directions								BIOINTERPHASES				3	3			FC2	FC12		10.1116/1.2965132			SEP 2008	2008	While the importance of protein adsorption to materials surfaces is widely recognized, little is understood at this time regarding how to design surfaces to control protein adsorption behavior. All-atom empirical force field molecular simulation methods have enormous potential to address this problem by providing an approach to directly investigate the adsorption behavior of peptides and proteins at the atomic level. As with any type of technology, however, these methods must be appropriately developed and applied if they are to provide realistic and useful results. Three issues that are particularly important for the accurate simulation of protein adsorption behavior are the selection of a valid force field to represent the atomic-level interactions involved, the accurate representation of solvation effects, and system sampling. In this article, each of these areas is addressed and future directions for continued development are presented.

In this work, a series of dendritic beta-D-galactopyranosides and alpha-D-mannopyranosides with a terminal amino group were synthesized and used for the functionalization of SWNTs, which targeted the defect-derived carboxylic acid moieties on the nanotube surface. The higher-order sugar dendrons were more effective in the solubilization of SWNTs, with the corresponding functionalized nanotube samples of improved aqueous solubility characteristics. Through the functionalization, the nanotube apparently serves as a unique scaffold for displaying multiple copies of the sugar molecules in pairs or quartets. Results on the synthesis and characterization of these sugar-functionalized SWNTs and their biological evaluations in binding assays with pathogenic Escherichia coli and with Bacillus subtilis (a nonvirulent simulant for Bacillus anthracis or anthrax) spores are presented and discussed.									43	1	0	20	0	44			1525-7797			WOS:000259033700018	18712920

Additive effects of a prolactin receptor antagonist, G129R, and herceptin on inhibition of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells								BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT				111	2			241	250		10.1007/s10549-007-9789-z			SEP 2008	2008	Breast cancers overexpressing human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) have been reported to have higher proliferative and metastatic activity in the presence of autocrine prolactin (PRL), indicating potential cooperation between HER2 and the PRL receptor (PRLR) during breast cancer progression. PRL can induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of HER2 which stimulates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity. To determine if this transactivation of HER2 by PRL contributes to anti-HER2 therapy resistance we examined the potential of combining Herceptin with a PRLR antagonist, G129R, which inhibits PRL-induced signaling, as a novel therapeutic strategy. Two PRL-expressing human breast cancer cell lines (T-47D and BT-474) that overexpress PRLR and HER2 to different degrees were chosen for this study. The phosphorylation status of HER2 and activation of MAPK, signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT), as well as phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) signaling cascades were examined in response to Herceptin, G129R or a combination of the two in either the absence or presence of exogenous PRL. As a single agent, Herceptin was more effective than G129R at inhibiting AKT phosphorylation; whereas, G129R was superior at blocking STAT3 and STAT5 activation. G129R was also able to directly inhibit the HER2 phosphorylation. The combination of Herceptin and G129R had an additive inhibitory effect on HER2 and MAPK phosphorylation, confirming that the MAPK signaling is a converging pathway shared by both HER2 and the PRLR. Combination of Herceptin and G129R also additively inhibited cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo as measured by inhibition of the growth of T-47D and BT-474 xenografts in athymic nude mice. We conclude that an anti-HER2 and anti-PRLR regimen may offer a new approach to treat HER2-overexpressing breast cancers.									20	2	0	18	0	22			0167-6806			WOS:000257913500006	17955362	
J	Silbiger, Nyssa J.; Childress, Michael J.								Interspecific variation in anemone shrimp distribution and host selection in the Florida Keys (USA): Implications for marine conservation								BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE				83	2			329	345					SEP 2008	2008	Host and symbiont abundances often depend on the degree of host specificity and differences in costs and benefits of these associations. In this Study, we investigated the distribution of anemone shrimps and their hosts along with the shrimps' host selection behavior to evaluate the degree of host specificity in a nearshore benthic community undergoing rapid environmental change. We compared the distribution of two shrimp species, Periclimenes pedersoni Chace, 1958, and Periclimenes yucatanicus (Ives, 1891), with their three anemone hosts, Condylactis gigantea (Weinland, 1860), Stichodactyla helianthus (Ellis, 1767), and Bartholomea annulata (Lesueur, 1817). The proportion of host anemones occupied by each shrimp species was significantly non-randorn considering abundance of each species per location and significantly different from a previous study conducted 18 yrs earlier. This was due to a decline in S. helianthus abundance. Periclimenes yucatanicus abundance was correlated with C. gigantea abundance, but P. pedersoni abundance was correlated with B. annulata abundance and all anemone species combined. A dichotomous choice test between C. gigantea and B. annulata revealed that P. yucatanicus selected C. gigantea regardless of its original host species. However, P. pedersoni selected its original host species. These results Suggest that P. yucatanicus retains a strong host specificity for C. gigantea, whereas P. pedersoni appears to show no Particular host specificity. Species with strong host specificity, such as P. yucatanicus, may be less likely to switch host species, and therefore, may be more susceptible to if decline in host abundance.									13	0	0	13	0	13			0007-4977			WOS:000259711700004		
J	Lee, Soon-Jae; Amirkhanian, Serji N.; Shatanawi, Khaldoun; Thodesen, Carl								Influence of compaction temperature on rubberized asphalt mixes and binders								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING				35	9			908	917		10.1139/L08-045			SEP 2008	2008	This research investigates the influence of compaction temperature on rubberized asphalt mixes and binders. For this, four Superpave mix designs for four asphalt binders (control, 3% styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS)-modified, 10% rubber-modified, and 15% rubber-modified) were carried out. A total of 160 specimens were manufactured at four compaction temperatures of 116, 135, 154, and 173 degrees C. The binders were artificially short-term aged for 2 h at the mixture compaction temperatures prior to the binder tests. The results from this study showed that: (i) the control and SBS-modified mixtures could have almost the same air-void contents at a wide range of compaction temperatures; (ii) the compaction temperatures significantly affected the volumetric properties of the rubberized mixes; (iii) the aging difference of asphalt binder in the mixture depending on the compaction temperature is not considered to be a main factor affecting the volumetric properties of the mixtures.									4	0	0	0	2	6			0315-1468			WOS:000259828900004

The sample included 152 mother-child dyads. The children's mean age was 10 years, and 45% were male. Multivariate linear regression analyses tested the main and interactive effects of child maltreatment and mothers' exposure to physical IPV on children's psychological functioning (internalizing and externalizing symptoms, traumatic stress symptoms), while controlling for covariates.Results: Children who experienced child maltreatment and children whose mothers experienced physical IPV had higher levels of psychological distress than their respective counterparts. Post hoc analysis of significant interaction effects indicated that child maltreatment was associated with internalizing and externalizing problems and traumatic stress only when mothers reported higher levels of physical IPV. This finding did not hold true for youth whose mothers did not acknowledge elevated rates of physical IPV.Conclusions: African American youth from low-SES backgrounds who are maltreated and whose mothers experience physical IPV are at particularly high risk for psychological distress. Targeted prevention and intervention programs are needed for these poly-victimized youth. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Salehi-Khojin, Amin; Jalili, Nader								A comprehensive model for load transfer in nanotube reinforced piezoelectric polymeric composites subjected to electro-thermo-mechanical loadings								COMPOSITES PART B-ENGINEERING				39	6			986	998		10.1016/j.compositesb.2007.12.001			SEP 2008	2008	A semi-active control approach is proposed to obtain a composite structures with tunable mechanical properties ranging from stiffer structure to better damper. To do this, we propose to apply an external electrical field to a piezoelectric polymeric matrix such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) reinforced with carbon nanotube. Depending on the magnitude and direction of electrical field, PVDF can be poled in the radial direction to align the electro-negative and electro-positive parts of molecular unit resulting in variable separation distance between piezoelectric polymer and nanotube. This leads to control of restriction effect of nanotube on the polymer segments, and consequently results in tunable interfacial adhesion between piezoelectric polymer and nanotubes with faster response time. Along this line and in order to present an analytical framework for such multifunctional composites, a shear-lag model is developed for nanotube-based piezoelectric polymeric composites subjected to electro-thermo-mechanical loadings. Since the adhesion in nanotube-based composite is universally present in the form of van der Waals (vdW) interaction, the shear stress and the axial displacement of nanotube and matrix differ in the interface zone and are not the same. This makes modeling of interface region more challenging and involved. To remedy this complexity, we propose to obtain the relative axial displacement between nanotube and polymer in the interphase zone using the Lennard-Jones potential. For this purpose, nanotube and matrix are considered as a set of concentric cylindrical shells with mechanical spring between them. The stiffness of this spring represents the strength of vdW interaction. Simulation results indicate that as the electrical load increases, the relative displacement between nanotube and polymer increases consequently, which leads to possible slippage increase. Furthermore, results demonstrate that stiffer structures show better tuning capability, which in turn, may have great potential for use in next-generation semi-active vibration control systems.

J	Li, G.								A multilevel component mode synthesis approach for the calculation of the phonon density of states of nanocomposite structures								COMPUTATIONAL MECHANICS				42	4			593	606		10.1007/s00466-008-0275-1			SEP 2008	2008	In this paper, a multilevel component mode synthesis (MCMS) approach is presented for the calculation of the phonon density of states (PDOS) of nanocomposite structures. In this approach, the nanocomposite structures are described by hierarchical levels of substructures. The phonon frequencies and modes are first computed for the bottom level substructures by using the theory of lattice dynamics. The computed component modes are then synthesized by using a quasi-static component mode synthesis (QSM) technique to obtain the phonon modes of the upper-level substructures in a bottom-up manner. By repeating this procedure, the PDOS of the entire nanostructure can be obtained. The proposed approach, while retains the atomic description of the nanocomposite structure, significantly reduces the computational cost of the calculation. Numerical calculations show that the proposed approach provides accurate results with a much less computational cost. The PDOS of several 1-D atom chains and 2-D atom sheets are computed by using the MCMS.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0178-7675			WOS:000257487300010

However, the vast majority of tasks Studied have primarily used a visual display (e.g., graphical user interfaces). In the current Study, the relationship between spatial ability and performance ill a non-visual computer-based navigation task was examined ill a sample of 196 participants ranging in age from 18 to 91. Participants called into a simulated interactive voice response system and carried Out a variety of transactions. They also completed measures of attention, working memory, and spatial abilities. The results showed that age-related differences in spatial ability predicted a significant amount of variance in performance in the non-visual computer task, even after controlling for other abilities. Understanding the abilities that influence performance with technology may provide insight into the Source of age-related performance differences in the successful use of technology.

The memetic algorithm has several advantages including the fact that the random keys representation ensures that feasible tours are maintained during the application of genetic operators. To illustrate the quality of the methodology, experiments are conducted using Euclidean TSP examples and a comparison is made to one example found in the literature. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Recycling of laboratory-prepared long-term aged binders containing crumb rubber modifier								CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS				22	9			1906	1913		10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2007.07.012			SEP 2008	2008	The use of conventional reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) has become routine in a number of states throughout the United States, and the satisfactory mix design procedures have been developed. The recycling of crumb rubber-modified materials has been an area of interest since crumb rubber modifier (CRM) was first used in asphalt paving materials over 40 years ago. Some state departments of transportation (DOTs) have used rubberized asphalt concrete (RAC) materials in limited recycling experiments or demonstration projects. The respective studies include different types of wet process binders and/or various gradations of CRM as an aggregate substitute (dry process). The results show that a wide range of CRM-modified paving materials can be successfully reclaimed and recycled.Previous research on the recycling of RAC focused only on the mixture properties at the location of in-field paving. In the long-term performance characterizations, it is important to identify the aging properties of rubberized binders and the subsequent recycling properties of these aged rubberized binders. Without understanding these binder properties, it is difficult to predict the mixture performance and suggest guidelines for the recycling of RAC. To address this issue, this research was conducted to identify the performance properties of recycled aged CRM binders. Evaluation of the recycled aged CRM binders included the following testing procedures: viscosity at high temperature, rheological properties at high and intermediate temperatures, and cracking properties at low temperature. The results from this study indicated that the recycled aged CRM binders can result in satisfactory binder performance which meets current Superpave binder requirements. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

However, their ionization states depend on such factors as the pH of the water phase, the interactions with other charges and with water molecules. Therefore, the ionization states must be predicted prior to the application of in silico screening or docking protocols. A typical virtual screening protocol searches for new heat compounds by testing hundreds of thousands or millions of small molecules against a particular target receptor. Differences in the size of receptors and the ligand, and the large number of small molecules to screen, require different computational approaches in predicting pKa's of ionizable groups. On the receptor side, while the computational protocol does not have to be fast, it must account for shape of the receptor and the long range interactions of all ionizable groups within. Conversely, while the calculations of the ionization states of the ligand must be fast, they do not have to consider many long range interactions because of the small size of the ligand. These requirements resulted in the development of different protocols for computing pKa's of the receptor and the ligand. The advantages and disadvantages of both are outlined in this paper. In addition, the formation of the receptor-ligand complex could dramatically change the electrostatic environment of the ionizable groups and cause proton uptake/release. Accounting for such phenomena can be critical for obtaining correct docking solutions.									17	0	0	14	0	17			1573-4099			WOS:000259444700003

This research investigated relationships between copper fractionation (through sequential extractions) and bioavailability in three reservoir sediments over a 60 d contact duration. Copper was initially associated with exchangeable, carbonate, and oxidizable fractions for copper-amended sediments; and redistributed to the reducible and oxidizable fractions after 60 d. Hyalella azteca mortality declined over time for organisms exposed to copper-amended reservoir sediments, indicating concomitant declines in sediment copper bioavailability. Comparisons between sequential extractions and organism responses indicated that bioavailability was primarily associated with the exchangeable fraction. Results of this research indicated fractionation and bioavailability of amended copper in sediments were influenced by contact duration along with sediment and overlying water characteristics. The influence of contact duration on copper bioavailability in sediments is important for assessing potential risks incurred by repeated applications of copper-containing algaecides in reservoirs.

In nanoscale channels, however, the enormous electric fields inside electrical double layers cause transverse ion distributions yielding charge-dependent mean ion speeds in the flow. Those ions with a constant charge-to-size ratio can thus be separated solely by charge (or equivalently, size) in nanofluidics. Here we develop an analytical model to optimize and compare the separation of such ions in nanochannel chromatography and nanochannel electrophoresis in terms of selectivity, plate height and resolution. Both planar and cylindrical geometries are considered. It is found that in nanoscale channels chromatography yields a larger selectivity and a larger minimum reduced plate height than electrophoresis does. The maximum resolution is, however, comparable between these two nanofluidic approaches, where the optimal channel half-height or tube radius is within the range of 1-10 times the Debye length. Our results also suggest that cations can be better separated in nanofluidics than can anions.									16	0	0	2	0	16			0173-0835			WOS:000260242100004	18850643

Neglected landraces of collard (Brassica oleracea L. var. viridis) from the Carolinas (USA)								GENETIC RESOURCES AND CROP EVOLUTION				55	6			797	801		10.1007/s10722-007-9284-8			SEP 2008	2008	A common garden crop grown in the coastal plain region of North and South Carolina (United States) is the non-heading, leafy green type of Brassica oleracea L. known as collard (B. oleracea L. subsp. oleracea convar. acephala (DC.) Alef. var. viridis L.). Predominantly a fall and winter vegetable in this region, collard is often the only green planting to be found in the yard or garden of a rural home during these cool seasons. Historically, the traditional collard patch and even commercial fields were planted with unique varieties perpetuated by individual seed savers, and collectively, the regional diversity for this crop was probably very significant for well over a century. Genetic erosion of this collard germplasm pool has been severe in recent decades as commercial hybrids have been adopted by both large-scale producers and home gardeners. Although a significant number of collard landraces are being perpetuated to this day, existing diversity among landraces still grown in the region is now in the hands of an aging population of seed savers who maintain germplasm through on-farm preservation. From 2003 to 2006, we explored the coastal plain region of North and South Carolina in search of collard gardens containing traditional landraces. Exploration trips were conducted mid-winter to early spring. About 90 samples of collard were obtained from seed savers during the course of this exploration. Observations of morphological differences of these landraces indicate that significant diversity exists in this group. Obtained landraces are being deposited into the U.S. plant introduction collection and will be available for future use. This preserved collection could prove to be an important new source of genes for B. oleracea improvement.									6	0	0	6	0	7			0925-9864			WOS:000257932100003

Its size and complexity represent a major challenge for the of agronomically important genes. Here we report Oil the first attempt to isolate a gene from sugarcane by map-based cloning, targeting a durable major rust resistance gene (Bru1). We describe the genomic strategies that we have developed to overcome constraints associated with high polyploidy in the successive steps of map-based cloning approaches, including diploid/polyploid syntenic shuttle mapping with two 9 1 model diploid species (sorghum and rice) and haplotype-specific chromosome walking. Their applications allowed LIS (1) to develop a high-resolution map including markers at 0.28 and 0.14 cM on both sides and 13 markers cosegregating with Brul and (11) to develop a physical map of the target haplotype that still includes two gaps at this stage due to die discovery of an insertion specific to this haplotype. These approaches will pave the way for the development of future map-based cloning approaches for sugarcane and other complex poIN-ploid species.									30	1	0	26	0	31			1943-2631			WOS:000259758500053	18757946

These findings, reported by groups at the University of Central Florida, Clemson University, and throughout other research programs within the United States and abroad, have examined the relationship between the network modification and other photoresponse of IR glasses upon exposure to near-infrared (NIR) femtosecond laser exposure. Contained is a review on the principles of femtosecond laser writing in glass, the photoinduced phenomena, and a summary of the main models predicting photoinduced material response. We compare the photoresponse of As- and Ge-based films, taken as example, following NIR femtosecond laser irradiation that results in near-surface photoexpansion and an increase or decrease of the refractive index, respectively. This difference in photoresponse has been related to the "layered" network of the As-based glass that leads to the breaking and formation of bonds during laser exposure as compared to the 3-D network of Ge-based glass that leads only to a modification of the bond arrangements. Last, an explanation of the need to control the photoresponse of ChGs by aging, changing the glass thermal history, adding modifiers, or replacing the anions forming the network is discussed.									20	0	0	0	0	20			1077-260X	1558-4542		WOS:000260463200008

In order to further decrease the thermal conductivity, the double-filling approach has been adopted using ytterbium, in conjunction with indium, due to its heavy mass and small size. The In(0.1)Yb(y)Co(4)Sb(12) (y=0.00, 0.05, 0.10, and 0.20) samples have been prepared by a melting method and subsequently characterized by means of electron microscopy, electrical resistivity, Seebeck coefficient, thermal conductivity, and Hall coefficient measurements. The results show that the ytterbium filling effectively decreases the thermal conductivity without degrading the power factor, resulting in an enhancement of the dimensionless figure of merit ZT.

In spite of the various antibiotics used to treat infections, antimicrobial resistance is an unavoidable consequence. Thus, other prevention modalities are warranted to prevent multiple-drug-resistant (MDR) S. aureus transmission. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles decompose organic compounds by the formation of hydroxyl radicals and superoxide ions when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light. Commercially available anatase phase TiO2 nanoparticles can serve as antimicrobial agents via UV light activation. However, biphasic brookite-anatase nanoparticles, due to their smaller particle size, may increase the efficiency of TiO2 nanoparticles to inhibit bacterial growth by promoting a greater surface area contact ratio. Both the TiO2 free-suspension and drop-coated slide bioassays were conducted to determine the effects of UV light activated TiO2 nanoparticles on S. aureus and the results revealed non-selective killing properties of the nanoparticles. Furthermore, UV light activated biphasic brookite-anatase nanoparticles (1 mg/mL) caused at least a 7-log reduction in MDR S. aureus cell viability within 30 minutes while anatase nanoparticles, under the same conditions, required approximately 75 minutes for complete cell death. Physical damage to the cells by UV light activated TiO2 nanoparticles was also confirmed by scanning electron microscopy.									9	0	0	4	0	9			1550-7033	1550-7041		WOS:000260776500013

There is a criticism that Six Sigma simply puts traditional quality management practices in a new package. To investigate this issue and the role of Six Sigma in quality management, this study reviewed both the traditional quality management and Six Sigma literatures and identified three new practices that are critical for implementing Six Sigma's concept and method in an organization. These practices are referred to as: Six Sigma role structure, Six Sigma structured improvement procedure, and Six Sigma focus on metrics. A research model and survey instrument were developed to investigate how these Six Sigma practices integrate with seven traditional quality management practices to affect quality performance and business performance. Test results based on a sample of 226 US manufacturing plants revealed that the three Six Sigma practices are distinct practices from traditional quality management practices, and that they complement the traditional quality management practices in improving performance. The implications of the findings for researchers and practitioners are discussed and further research directions are offered. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Reaching Parents to Prevent Adolescent Risky Behavior: Examining the Effects of Threat Portrayal and Parenting Orientation on Parental Participation Perceptions								JOURNAL OF PUBLIC POLICY & MARKETING				27	2			149	155		10.1509/jppm.27.2.149			FAL 2008	2008	With more than two million teens affected, adolescents are the most at-risk group for unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases. Parents, who teens cite as their most influential resource for making decisions about premarital sex, receive little consideration from federal initiatives. However, promoting more active parenting to parents to reduce risky behavior among teenagers seems to be an appropriate strategy. This study examines parents' reactions to advertisements that promote abstinence education programs. The results indicate that "warm" parents (i.e., those who indicate concern about children's interactions with the marketplace) are more likely to intend to communicate with their children about sex and have a more favorable attitude toward the ad when the advertisement is clear about the consequences of teens engaging in sex. The findings have implications for how public policy officials and agencies can influence parents as key socialization agents in efforts to prevent adolescents from engaging in risky sexual behavior.									6	0	0	0	0	6			0743-9156			WOS:000261267200003

Low and List have remained the obligatory reference on this matter for almost three decades. Based on a limited number of drop sizes (10), Low and List proposed generalized parameterizations of collisional breakup across the raindrop spectra that are standard building blocks for numerical models of rainfall microphysics. Here, recent laboratory experiments of drop collision at NASA's Wallops Island Facility (NWIF) using updated high-speed imaging technology with the objective of assessing the generality of Low and List are reported. The experimental fragment size distributions (FSDs) for the collision of selected drop pairs were evaluated against explicit simulations using a dynamical microphysics model (Prat and Barros, with parameterizations based on Low and List updated by McFarquhar). Onetoone comparison of the FSDs shows similar distributions; however, the model was found to underestimate the fragment numbers observed in the smallest diameter range (e. g., D < 0.2 mm), and to overestimate the number of fragments produced when small drops (diameter DS >= 1mm) and large drops (diameter DL >= 3mm) collide. This effect is particularly large for fragments in the 0.5-1.0-mm range, and more so for filament breakup (the most frequent type of breakup observed in laboratory conditions), reflecting up to 30% uncertainty in the left-hand side of the FSD (i. e., the submillimeter range). For coalescence, the NWIF experiments confirmed the drop collision energy cutoff (E-T) estimated by Low and List (i. e., E-T > 5.0 mu J). Finally, the digital imagery of the laboratory experiments was analyzed to determine the characteristic time necessary to reach stability in relevant statistical properties. The results indicate that the temporal separation between particle (i. e., single hydrometeor) and population behavior, that is, the characteristic time scale to reach homogeneity in the NWIF raindrop populations, is 160 ms, which provides a lower bound to the governing time scale in population-based microphysical models.									23	0	0	2	0	23			0022-4928			WOS:000259378800015

These microcompartments serve as organelles by sequestering specific metabolic pathways in bacterial cells. The carboxysome, a prototypical bacterial microcompartment that is found in cyanobacteria and some chemoautotrophs, encapsulates ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) and carbonic anhydrase, and thereby enhances carbon fixation by elevating the levels of CO(2) in the vicinity of RuBisCO. Evolutionarily related, but functionally distinct, microcompartments are present in diverse bacteria. Although bacterial microcompartments were first observed more than 40 years ago, a detailed understanding of how they function is only now beginning to emerge.									195	2	0	166	1	199			1740-1526			WOS:000258413100013	18679172

Hardware acceleration of image recognition through a visual cortex model								OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY				40	6			795	802		10.1016/j.optlastec.2007.12.007			SEP 2008	2008	Recent findings in neuroscience have led to the development of several new models describing the processes in the neocortex. These models excel at cognitive applications such as image analysis and movement control. This paper presents a hardware architecture to speed up image content recognition through a recently proposed model of the visual cortex. The system is based on a set of parallel computation nodes implemented in an FPGA. The design was optimized for hardware by reducing the data storage requirements, and removing the need for multiplies and divides. The reconfigurable logic hardware implementation running at 121 MHz provided a speedup of 148 times over a 2GHz AMD Opteron processor. The results indicate the feasibility of specialized hardware to accelerate larger biological scale implementations of the model.									3	1	0	0	0	4			0030-3992			WOS:000255893800006

Optoelectronics letters				4	5			387	390		10.1007/s11801-008-8059-6			2008-Sep	2008	In this report we illustrate our application of soft lithography-based microfabrication, surface modification, and our unique laser cell-patterning system toward the creation of neuron biochips. We deposited individual forebrain neurons from Day 7 embryonic chicks into two rows of eight in a silicon microstructure aligned over a microelectrode array (MEA). The polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane with microstructures to confine cells and guide network connectivity was aligned to the electrodes of a MEA. Both the MEA and the PDMS membrane were treated with O2 plasma, Poly-L-Lysine, and Laminin to aid in cell attachment and survival. The primary advantage of our process is that it is quicker and simpler than previous cell-placement methods and may make highly defined neuronal network biochips more practical.									6	0	0	1	0	6			1673-1905			MEDLINE:23894235	23894235	
J	Roth, Philip; Bobko, Philip; McFarland, Lynn; Buster, Maury								Work sample tests in personnel selection: A meta-analysis of black-white differences in overall and exercise scores								PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY				61	3			637	661		10.1111/j.1744-6570.2008.00125.x			FAL 2008	2008	Work sample exams are generally thought to have either low or comparatively low levels of ethnic group differences when used for personnel selection. Such exams are sometimes called "simulation exercises" and involve having applicants perform a set of tasks that are similar to those performed on the job. The nearly ubiquitous meta-analytic value of Black-White subgroup differences in the literature is d = .38. Unfortunately, this estimate is plagued by a variety of problems (e.g., range restriction, inclusion of nonwork sample tests). Further, there are virtually no analyses that examine how the saturation of different constructs influence work sample tests. We gathered available data for Black-White ethnic group differences and found that overall work sample differences were markedly larger for samples of job applicants (d = .73) than previously thought. We also examined how different exercises and saturation of different constructs influenced work sample ds. For example, work sample test ratings of cognitive and job knowledge skills were associated with a mean observed d = .80, whereas ratings of various social skills were associated with mean observed ds that varied from .21 to .27. We urge scientists and practitioners to consider both the method and the constructs that are targeted when forecasting predictor ds.									26	1	0	0	3	30			0031-5826	1744-6570		WOS:000258206700006

Propiconazole inhibits Armillaria tabescens in vitro and translocates into peach roots following trunk infusion								PLANT DISEASE				92	9			1293	1298		10.1094/PDIS-92-9-1293			SEP 2008	2008	Intravascular trunk infusion of propiconazole has been associated with beneficial effects on Armillaria root rot control in Prunus sp. but its basipetal movement has not been verified. Propiconazole, a sterol demethylation inhibitor fungicide, was more effective in inhibiting mycelial growth of Armillaria tabescens isolates in vitro (average effective concentration to inhibit mycelial growth by 50% [EC50 value] of 0.6 mu g/ml) compared with fungicides from five other chemical classes (EC50 values ranging from 4.6 to >1,000 mu g/ml). The fungicide was infused into the vascular system of peach trees in the spring, summer, and fall of 2005 and 2006. Propiconazole concentration was determined using gas chromatography mass spectrometry in trunk sections above and below the infusion site and in primary roots. Over two experimental years, spring and fall infusions resulted in consistent propiconazole accumulations in primary peach roots. Spring infusions yielded propiconazole concentrations of 1.7 mu g/g in 2005 and 5.6 mu g/g in 2006, whereas the highest accumlations were detected following fall infusions with 9.2 mu g/g in 2005 and 6.7 mu g/g in 2006. Propiconazole was also consistently detected in trunk sections collected from above and below the infusion site. The basipetal movement of propiconazole in peach trees and its inhibitory activity against A. tabescens in vitro suggest that propiconazole infusion could be useful for targeted Armillaria root rot management.									3	0	0	3	0	3			0191-2917			WOS:000258561300005

A Systematic Approach for Assessing the Currency ("Up-to-Dateness") of Job-Analytic Information								PUBLIC PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT				37	3			261	277					FAL 2008	2008	Job analytic information is central to a variety of human resource activities (e. g., selection system development, compensation system development, organizational design). It is also well understood that many jobs are changing due to forces such as technological advances, a desire for teamwork, and various organizational interventions. In addressing such changes when using job analytic information, human resource practitioners might be faced with questions about the currency, or "up-to-dateness," of their existing job analysis. Unfortunately, there is almost no guidance for researchers or professionals regarding what methods might be used to check job analyses for currency (i.e., if there are any changes to the job that might influence the job analysis, how does one systematically assess such changes). We review the scant literature in this area and offer a protocol that we developed and implemented within a litigious environment. The protocol is systematic and focused on job change. In order to be as efficient as possible (and sensitive to organizational resource expenditures), the protocol builds on prior job analytic information. Two examples of the protocol's implementation are provided. We also present a variety of lessons learned during the development and implementation of this relatively unique currency protocol, as well as a discussion of some possible variants of the method.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0091-0260			WOS:000260451900001

Early increase in osteoclast number in mice after whole-body irradiation with 2 Gy x rays								RADIATION RESEARCH				170	3			388	392		10.1667/RR1388.1			SEP 2008	2008	Bone loss is a consequence of exposure to high-dose radiotherapy. While damage to bone vasculature and reduced proliferation of bone-forming osteoclasts has been implicated in this process, the effect of radiation on the number and activity of bone-resorbing osteoclasts has not been characterized. In this study, we exposed mice to a whole-body dose of 2 Gy of X rays to quantify the early effects of radiation on osteoclasts and bone structural properties. Female C57BL/6 mice (13 weeks old) were divided into two groups: irradiated and non-irradiated controls. Animals were killed humanely 3 days after radiation exposure. Analysis of serum chemistry revealed a 14% increase in the concentration of tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-5b, a marker of osteoclast activity, in irradiated mice (P < 0.05). 0steoclast number (+44%; P < 0.05) and osteoclast surface (+213%; P < 0.001) were elevated in TRAP-stained histological sections of tibial metaphyses. No significant change was observed in osteoblast surface or osteocalcin concentration or in trabecular microarchitecture (i.e. bone volume fraction) as measured through microcomputed tomography (P > 0.05). This study provides definitive, quantitative evidence of an early, radiation-induced increase in osteoclast activity and number. Osteoclastic bone resorption may represent a contributor to bone atrophy observed after therapeutic irradiation.

The efficacious use of these medications requires monitoring students for desired behavioral outcomes as well as potential side effects. Educators are in an excellent position to monitor medication effectiveness and provide feedback to the prescribing physician because they are in close proximity of students for up to 6 hr per day. However, to date, there has been sparse research investigating teachers' knowledge of the desired therapeutic outcomes and potential side effects of even the most common psychotropic medications prescribed to youth. A survey of staff from 12 nonpublic residential and special day schools found that special educators and paraprofessionals alike have minimal knowledge of any medication, with the exception of stimulants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.									9	0	0	0	0	9			0741-9325			WOS:000262166200002

In our study, structural restoration involves mechanically modifying the woody plant assemblage to a species composition, density, and community structure specified by the restoration goals. Functional restoration involves reintroducing dormant-season, low-severity fire at intervals consistent with the historical condition. Our approach was to quantify the effects of such restoration treatments on soil organic carbon and soil microbial activity, as these are both conservative ecosystem attributes and not ones explicitly targeted by the restoration treatments, themselves. Fire, mechanical thinning, and their combination all initially resulted in reduced soil organic C content, C:N ratio, and overall microbial activity (measured as acid phosphatase activity) in a study site in the southern Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina, but only the effect on microbial activity persisted into the fourth post-treatment growing season. In contrast, in a similar forest in the central Appalachian Plateau of Ohio, mechanical thinning resulted in increased soil organic C, decreased C:N ratio, and decreased microbial activity, whereas fire and the combination of fire and thinning did not have such effects. In addition, the effects in Ohio had dissipated prior to the fourth post-treatment growing season. Mechanical treatments are attractive in that they require only single entries; however, we see no indication that mechanical-structural restoration actually produced desired belowground changes. A single fire-based/functional treatment also offered little restoration progress, but comparisons with long-term experimental fire studies suggest that repeated entries with prescribed fire at intervals of 3-8 years offer potential for sustainable restoration.									7	0	0	7	0	8			1061-2971			WOS:000259089000009

J	Cook, Michelle; Wiebe, Eric N.; Carter, Glenda								The influence of prior knowledge on viewing and interpreting graphics with macroscopic and molecular representations								SCIENCE EDUCATION				92	5			848	867		10.1002/sce.20262			SEP 2008	2008	Previous research has indicated that the use of multiple representations with macroscopic and molecular features can improve conceptual understanding; however, the influence of prior knowledge of the domain cannot be overlooked. Using eye-tracking technology nd sequential analysis. this study investigated how high school students (n = 54) with different levels of prior knowledge transitioned among the macroscopic and molecular representations of the selected cell transport graphics. The results indicated that high prior knowledge students transitioned more frequently between the molecular representations, whereas low prior knowledge students transitioned more frequently between the macroscopic representations. These findings suggest that students with high prior knowledge distributed their Visual attention on conceptually relevant features, whereas low prior knowledge students focused on surface features. In addition, low prior knowledge students transitioned more frequently between macroscopic and molecular representations, suggesting that these students were experiencing more difficulty as they were coordinating the representations. Because these students were using surface features to create linkages between the representations, they were unable to understand the underlying themes. More research on the differences in the distribution of visual attention among learners can provide further insight as to the difficulties low prior knowledge students face when interpreting multiple representations.

We tested hypotheses that: 1) beetles were randomly distributed in the study area, 2) male and female beetles moved equally throughout the study area in one day, and 3) males and females moved the same distance over successive days. Beetle activity increased with increasing temperature and decreased with cool, rainy, or cloudy conditions. The beetles preferred open areas with no vegetation. Males drove away other males that entered their "territory" where they rested and attempted to copulate with passing females. Both sexes of P tarsalis showed some fidelity to an area, but males ranged only about half as far as females. Males may derive a reproductive advantage by restricting their range and waiting for receptive females, even those ovipositing. Individuals of both sexes returned to approximately the same general area after their daily foraging, ovipositing, and other activities. Individuals were normally (Poisson) distributed throughout the study area, with about eight beetles per 4 x 5-m plot at any one time.									0	0	0	1	0	1			0147-1724			WOS:000261812100004

Plants were grown in the field beneath black shade cloths providing 47 and 87% shade and in full sunlight (no shading). All photosynthetic measurements were taken 4 wk after initiating the shade treatments. Photosynthetic rates of Palmer amaranth grown under 47% shade increased with increasing photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) similar to 0% shade-grown plants. Light-saturated photosynthetic rates were predicted beyond the highest measured PAR of 1,200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) for plants grown under 0 and 47% shade. Plants acclimated to increased shading by decreasing light-saturated photosynthetic rates from 60.5 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) under full sun conditions to 26.4 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) under 87% shade. Plants grown under 87% shade lowered their light compensation point. Rate of increase in plant height was similar among shade treatments. Plants responded to increased shading by a 13 to 44% reduction in leaf appearance rate (leaf number growing degree days [GDD](-1)) and a 22 to 63% reduction in main-stem branch appearance rate (main-stem branch number GDD(-1)) compared with full sunlight. Palmer amaranth specific leaf area increased from 68 to 97 cm(2) g(-1) as shading increased to 87%. Plants acclimated to 47% shade by increasing total leaf chlorophyll from 22.8 mu g cm(-2) in full sunlight to 31.7 mu g cm(-2) when shaded; however, the increase was not significant at 87% shading. Thus, it is concluded that Palmer amaranth shows photosynthetic and morphological acclimation to 87% or less shading.									14	0	0	11	1	14			0043-1745			WOS:000259214400011		
J	Hallac, B. B.; Geiculescu, O. E.; Rajagopal, R. V.; Creager, S. E.; DesMarteau, D. D.								Lithium-conducting ionic melt electrolytes from polyether-functionalized fluorosulfonimide anions								ELECTROCHIMICA ACTA				53	20			5985	5991		10.1016/j.electacta.2008.03.061			AUG 20 2008	2008	Solvent-free lithium-conducting ionic melt (IM) electrolytes were synthesized and characterized with respect to chemical structure, purity, and ion transport properties. The melts consist of lithium (perfluorovinylether)sulfonimide salts attached covalently to a lithium-solvating polyether chain. Ionic conductivities are relatively high which is a consequence of the favorable combination of the low lattice energy of the lithium fluorosulfonimide salt (low basicity of the fluorosulfonimide anion), the relatively low viscosity of the polyether matrix, and the relatively high salt content of the melts. Galvanostatic dc polarization experiments, using cells with non-blocking Li electrodes, indicate that salt concentration polarization does not occur in these electrolytes as dc current is passed through them.

The alternative approach, i.e. the template-based prediction with pure sequence information as a starting point, is still considered as being inferior mostly due to presumption that the pool of available structures of protein-protein complexes, which can serve as putative templates, is not sufficiently large. Recently, however, several labs have developed databases containing thousands of 3D structures of protein-protein complexes, which enable statistically reliable testing of homology-based algorithms. In this paper we report the results on homology-based modeling of 3D structures of protein complexes using alignments of modified sequence profiles. The method, called HOMology-BAsed COmplex Prediction (HOMBACOP), has two distinctive features: (I) extra weight on aligning interfacial residues in the dynamical programming algorithm, and (11) increased gap penalties for the interfacial segments. The method was tested against our recently developed ProtCom database and against the Boston University protein-protein BENCHMARK. In both cases, models generated were compared to the models built on basis of customarily protein structure initiative (PSI)-BLAST sequence alignments. It was found that existence of homologous (by the means of PSI-BLAST) templates (44% of cases) enables both methods to produce models of good quality, with the profiles method outperforming the PSI-BLAST models (with respect to the percentage of correctly predicted residues on the complex interface and fraction of native interfacial contacts). The models were evaluated according to the CAPRI assessment criteria and about two thirds of the models were found to fall into acceptable and medium-quality categories. The same comparison of a larger set of 463 protein complexes showed again that profiles generate better models. We further demonstrate, using our ProtCom database, the suitability of the profile alignment algorithm in detecting remote homologues between query and template sequences, where the PSI-BLAST method fails.

The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of eugenol incorporated in malt extract agar medium was found to be 2 ring ml(-1). Mycelial growth of the four test pathogens was completely inhibited when treated with 150 mu l l(-1) of volatile eugenol whether at 4 or 20 degrees C. Conidia of P vagabunda, P. expansum, M. fructigena and B. cinerea suspended for 2 min in eugenol solution at 2 mg ml(-1) heated to 50 degrees C germinated at rates of 19, 37, 38 and 39%, respectively. Three different eugenol formulations (Tween 80, ethoxylate and lecithin) were tested for their in vivo efficacy against the tested pathogens on apples. Ethoxylate- and Tween 80-eugenol formulations applied at room temperature were ineffective in reducing disease incidence. When heated to 50 degrees C, both formulations induced phytotoxicity on apple surface and caused cuticle damages as revealed by scanning electronic microscopic observations. A mixture of eugenol at 2 mg ml(-1) and soy lecithin at 50 mg ml(-1) suppressed the phytotoxic symptoms produced by eugenol on apples and reduced the disease incidence of P. expansum. P. vagabunda, B. cinerea and M. fructigena to less than 7, 6, 4 and 2% respectively after 6 months of storage at 2 degrees C. The application of heated lecithin-formulated eugenol could become a successful alternative to the traditional fungicides used in postharvest disease management of apple fruit. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This technique casts the tomographic inversion into a nonlinear minimization problem with regularizations. Here a simple and effective method is developed to determine the optimal regularization parameters in the nonlinear optimization problem. This method, combined with the minimization method described previously, provides a robust algorithm for hyperspectral tomography. This method takes advantage of an inherent feature of absorption and is therefore expected to be useful for other sensing techniques based on absorption spectroscopy.

SN 2007ax: An extremely faint type Ia supernova								ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS				683	1			L29	L32		10.1086/591521			AUG 10 2008	2008	We present multiband photometric and optical spectroscopic observations of SN 2007ax, the faintest and reddest Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) yet observed. With M-B = -15.9 (B - V)(max) = 1.2, this SN is over halfmax a magnitude fainter at maximum light than any other SN Ia. Similar to subluminous SN 2005ke, SN 2007ax also appears to show excess in UV emission at late time. Traditionally, Delta m(15)(B) has been used to parameterize the decline rate for SNe Ia. However, the B- band transition from fast to slow decline occurs sooner than 15 days for faint SNe Ia. Therefore we suggest that a more physically motivated parameter, the time of intersection of the two slopes, be used instead. Only by explaining the faintest (and the brightest) supernovae can we thoroughly understand the physics of thermonuclear explosions. We suggest that future surveys should carefully design their cadence, depth, pointings, and follow- up to find an unbiased sample of extremely faint members of this subclass of faint SNe Ia.									22	1	0	0	0	22						WOS:000258621300008

Maxwell, Phil. Trans. R. Soc. London 170, 231 (1879)]. Here a classical mechanical scattering theory is developed to describe direct scattering, trapping, and subsequent desorption of the incident beam. This theory allows a rigorous test of the Maxwell assumption and determines the conditions under which it is valid. The theory also gives quantitative explanations of important new experimental measurements [K.D. Gibson, N. Isa, and S. J. Sibener, J. Chem.

The SCRF method was evaluated for application to polymeric systems, and we demonstrate the difficulties involved in applying the method to bulk amorphous polymers with specific attention to the selection of the solvent probe radius. In addition, rotational isomeric states (RIS) calculations were performed, showing the effect of accounting for the bulk phase reaction field on the bond rotational energetics and characteristic ratio. We conclude that present methods of accounting for bulk environments in electronic structure calculations are not well suited for use with polymeric systems, and the development of improved methods is needed in this area.									8	0	0	0	0	8			1089-5639			WOS:000258097800017	18627136

More specifically, the relative intensity of photoluminescence spectra, both through direct excitation of the lanthanide as well as phonon sideband spectra were evaluated with increasing amounts of time held at specific temperatures. A one dimensional approximation was used to compute an effective diffusion coefficient for the rare earth dopants in LaF3. Despite the simplicity of the model employed, the calculated diffusion coefficients based on the spectroscopic results are accurate within an order of magnitude in comparison to other fluoride crystals yielding a simplified approach to estimating kinetic and diffusion effects in optical materials.

The literature came from materials that were collected in a larger study and included bereavement letters to families and other educational and resource materials available to the bereaved families, the caregivers, and the public. The method used to perform readability on the materials was the Simplified Measure of Gobbledygook. This process has been used to determine readability for more than 35 years and is widely accepted by the literacy community,. Results of the study revealed that the materials analyzed were written at just above a 10th grade reading level.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1049-9091			WOS:000258755200004	18463410

Quercetin reduces susceptibility to influenza infection following stressful exercise								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-REGULATORY INTEGRATIVE AND COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY				295	2			R505	R509		10.1152/ajpregu.90319.2008			AUG 1 2008	2008	Exercise stress is associated with increased risk for upper respiratory tract infection. We have shown that exercise stress can increase susceptibility to infection. Quercetin, a flavonoid present in a wide variety of fruits and vegetables, has been reported to inhibit infectivity and replication of a broad spectrum of viruses and may offset the increase in susceptibility to infection associated with stressful exercise. This study examined the effects of quercetin feedings on susceptibility to the influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) following stressful exercise. Mice were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: exercise-placebo, exercise-quercetin, control-placebo, or control-quercetin. Exercise consisted of a run to fatigue (similar to 140 min) on a treadmill for 3 consecutive days. Quercetin (12.5 mg/kg) was administered via gavage for 7 days before viral challenge. At 30 min after the last bout of exercise or rest, mice (n = 23-30) were intranasally inoculated with a standardized dose of influenza virus (0.04 hemagglutinating units). Mice were monitored daily for morbidity (time to sickness), symptom severity, and mortality (time to death) for 21 days. Exercise stress was associated with an increased susceptibility to infection [morbidity, mortality, and symptom severity on days 5-7 (P < 0.05)]; quercetin offset the increase in susceptibility to infection [morbidity, mortality, and symptom severity on days 5-7 (P < 0.05)] that was associated with stressful exercise. These data suggest that short-term quercetin feedings may prove to be an effective strategy to lessen the impact of stressful exercise on susceptibility to respiratory infection.									48	1	0	34	0	49			0363-6119			WOS:000258322700016	18579649

These SPA-RVC composite electrodes were fabricated by fitting a SPA-RVC composite cylinder inside a graphite tube and subsequently fixing the graphite tube onto a polypropylene micropipette tip. The electrode design allows for ease in reagent/washing steps involved in sandwich assay protocols and could easily be made portable. The electrode materials were characterized with respect to pore-size distribution, total free volume, ligament and bulk densities of the RVC, and physical structural characteristics. Coulometric detection of redox molecules such as K3Fe(CN)6 and 4-aminophenol was possible using SPA-RVC electrodes by the trapping of these redox molecules inside the SPA-RVC electrodes. Avidin affinity molecules were covalently immobilized onto the SPA matrix inside the RVC electrodes by periodate -activation followed by reductive amination. The amount of avidin immobilized inside the SPA-RVC electrodes was (5 0.06) x 10-11 mol, which was determined by saturating the avidin sites with biotinylated fluorescein (b-fluo) and subsequently determining the amount of immobilized b-fluo via a standard addition method using fluorescence spectroscopy. Non-specific binding of labeled enzymes such as biotinylated alkaline phosphatase (b-ALP) onto the SPA-RVC electrodes without avidin capture sites was determined to be less than 1% compared to the specific binding of b-ALP on avidinylated SPA-RVC electrodes.

The experiment consisted of three treatments with six replicates each. The stocking rates were 43 crayfish/m(2) in 0.18-m(2) tanks fitted with a stand of green rice. Each tank contained six crayfish, either six individuals of the same species or three individuals of each species. The mean stocking size for monoculture and polyculture were 32.6 +/- 0.05 and 33.0 +/- 0.07 mm total length, respectively. Survival and growth was assessed at 30-day intervals over a 90-day experimental period. Survival of two species was the same in the monoculture system (62.5%). Survival of P. clarkii in the polyculture c system (25.0%) was significantly lower than in the monoculture system (62.5%), whereas P. acutus acutus survived at similar rate in the polyculture system (41.7%) and monoculture system (62.5%). Survival was lower but growth was higher in the polyculture system than in the monoculture system for both species. Growth of P. acutus acutus in the polyculture system was significantly greater than in the monoculture system. No difference was observed in the growth of P. clarkii between polyculture and monoculture and the overall growth of P. acutus acutus and P. clarkii was similar for the 90 days. Yield did not differ significantly between monoculture and polyculture systems (P < 0.05). Total yields were in 1.15 kg/ha in monoculture and 1.18 kg/ha in polyculture.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0967-6120			WOS:000256908700006

Conventional means such as Agrobacterium infection, biolistic particle bombardment, electroporation, or polyethylene glycol attachment are often characterized by high cost, labor extensiveness, and a significant perturbation to the growth of cells. We have succeeded in delivering GFP-encoding plasmid DNA to turfgrass cells using poly(amidoamine) dendrimers. Our new scheme utilizes the physiochemical properties as well as the nanosize of the poly(amidoamine) dendrimer for direct and noninvasive gene delivery. The GFP gene was expressed in the plant cells as observed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. The transfection efficiency may be further improved by optimizing the pH of the cell culture medium and the molar ratio of the dendrimer to DNA. The use of the current delivery system can be extended to virtually all plant species having successful regeneration systems in place.									14	5	1	7	0	18			1860-6768			BCI:BCI200800655081	18543240	
J	Liang, Haiying; Frost, Christopher J.; Wei, Xiaoping; Brown, Nicole R.; Carlson, John E.; Tien, Ming								Improved sugar release from lignocellulosic material by introducing a tyrosine-rich cell wall peptide gene in poplar								CLEAN-SOIL AIR WATER				36	8			662	668		10.1002/clen.200800079			AUG 2008	2008	Lignin degradation is of critical importance in biomass utilization of woody plants, because the presence of lignin limits hydrolytic enzyme access to cellulose and hemicellulose. To date, strategies for lignin removal have ranged from treatment with lignin-degrading fungi to genetic manipulations that reduce lignin content or modify monolignol composition. However, reducing lignin content without compromising tree fitness can be difficult. An alternate approach to modify lignin composition by introducing in situ peptide cross-links is reported here. The hypothesis was that introducing in situ peptide cross-links would not change overall lignin content or distribution in the cell wall, yet should render the lignin more susceptible to protease digestion. To test this, a transgene encoding a high tyrosine-content peptide was designed to express in lignifying tissues of hybrid poplar. Relative to wildtypes, the transgenics had no change in total lignin content or overall plant morphology, although the wood in a number of lines had reduced storage modulus. As predicted, a number of transgenic lines were more susceptible to protease digestion than wildtypes, resulting in a higher polysaccharide release from the lignocellulose complexes. Although preliminary, these results suggest that this may be a viable means to facilitate lignin removal and potentially advance the utilization of woody biomass as a biofuel feedstock.									21	0	0	12	0	21			1863-0650			WOS:000258636300014

J	Starkey, Charles								Emotion and Full Understanding								ETHICAL THEORY AND MORAL PRACTICE				11	4			425	454		10.1007/s10677-007-9103-5			AUG 2008	2008	Aristotle has famously made the claim that having the right emotion at the right time is an essential part of moral virtue. Why might this be the case? I consider five possible relations between emotion and virtue and argue that an adequate answer to this question involves the epistemic status of emotion, that is, whether the perceptual awareness and hence the understanding of the object of emotion is like or unlike the perceptual awareness of an unemotional awareness of the same object. If an emotional awareness does not have a unique character, then it is unlikely that emotions provide an understanding that is different from unemotional states of awareness: they are perhaps little more than "hot-blooded" instances of the same understanding. If, on the other hand, an emotional state involves a perceptual awareness that is unique to the emotion, then emotions are cognitively significant, providing an understanding of the object of the emotion that is absent in a similar but unemotional episode of awareness. I argue the latter and substantiate the claim that emotions are essential to moral virtue because they can be essential to a full understanding of the situations that they involve. In such cases, emotions are not merely a symptom of the possession of an adequate understanding, but are rather necessary for having an adequate understanding.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1386-2820			WOS:000270837700006

Chitosan coating reduced respiration rate significantly (p < 0.05) in 'Fuji' apple and 'Satsuma' mandarin compared to uncoated and other coating materials. Chitosan coating on 'Fuji' apple showed the highest CO, and the lowest 02 concentration in the internal gas composition at 5 degrees C but showed no differences compared to other coating materials at 20 degrees C. 'Satsuma' mandarin showed significantly high CO2 concentration in chitosan coating at 20 degrees C but there were not significant differences among coating materials in CO2 and O-2 composition at 5 degrees C.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1226-7708	2092-6456		WOS:000258870200034		
J	Nagel, Alexis K.; Schnabel, Guido; Petri, Cesar; Scorza, Ralph								Generation and characterization of transgenic plum lines expressing the Gastrodia antifungal protein								HORTSCIENCE				43	5			1514	1521					AUG 2008	2008	The Gastrodia antifungal protein (GAFP) is a monocot mannose-binding lectin isolated from the Asiatic orchid Gastrodia elata. This lectin has previously been shown to provide increased resistance in transgenic Nicotiana tabacum against taxonomically unrelated root pathogens Phytophthora nicotianae, Rhizoctonia solani, and Meloidogyne incognita, but its potential to confer disease resistance in tree species is not known. Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation yielded three gafp-1 expressing plum lines (Prunus domestica) designated 4J, 4I, and 5D. These lines possessed one, two, and four copies of the gafp-1 gene, respectively, as demonstrated by DNA blotting. Lines 4J and 4I were not phenotypically different from the nontransformed control line, but line 5D showed significant divergence in leaf morphology and growth habit. Compared with the inoculated control line, lines 4J and 4I exhibited increased tolerance to Phytophthora root rot (PRR) caused by P. cinnamomi. When inoculated with the rootknot nematode, Meloidogyne incognita, the 4J and 4I lines showed a significantly lower degree of root galling than the inoculated control line. Nematode reproduction, as measured by the presence of egg masses and the number of eggs produced per gram fresh root, was significantly reduced in line 4J compared with the inoculated control line. The results of this study suggest that the expression of gafp-1 in the roots of a woody plant may confer some level of resistance to PRR and root-knot nematode. Long-term field trials will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis.									12	1	0	13	0	14			0018-5345	2327-9834		WOS:000257904000032

Background: Older adults' performance in information retrieval tasks has traditionally been lower compared with younger adults'. The cur-rent study examined the degree to which information organization moderated age-related performance differences on an information retrieval task. The theory of fluid and crystallized intelligence may provide insight into different kinds of information architectures that may reduce age-related differences in computer-based information retrieval performance. Method: Fifty younger (18-23 years of age) and 50 older (55-76 years of age) participants browsed a Web site for answers to specific questions. Half of the participants browsed the hierarchically organized system (taxonomy), which maintained a one-to-one relationship between menu link and page, whereas the other half browsed the tag-based interface, with a many-to-one relationship between menu and page. This difference was expected to interact with age-related differences in fluid and crystallized intelligence. Results: Age-related differences in information retrieval performance persisted; however, a tag-based retrieval interface reduced age-related differences, as compared with a taxonomical interface. Conclusion: Cognitive aging theory can lead to interface interventions that reduce age-related differences in performance with technology. In an information retrieval paradigm, older adults may be able to leverage their increased crystallized intelligence to offset fluid intelligence declines in a computer-based information search task. Application: More research is necessary, but the results suggest that information retrieval interfaces organized around keywords may reduce age-related differences in performance.									17	0	0	0	0	17			0018-7208			WOS:000258713300004	18767521

Spatial distribution of rare species in lotic habitats								INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY				1	3			127	134		10.1111/j.1752-4598.2008.00017.x			AUG 2008	2008	1. Species rarity is a common phenomenon in the biological world. Although rare species have always interested biologists, the meaning of 'rare' has not always been clear with the definition of rarity often arbitrary.2. In the current study, we investigate rarity in stream ecosystems using black flies (Diptera: Simuliidae). We defined rare species a priori as those species found <= 10% of stream sites examined (n = 111 streams for 'summer collections'; n = 88 collection for 'spring' collections). Hence, we are exploring only one axis of rarity, restricted range.3. We first consider the distribution of each rare species separately to determine if the mean (euclidian) distance among streams (habitats) for each rare species differs from a random model. We next took a collective approach by pooling all rare species to determine the influence of stream conditions, niche breadth, and distance among habitats on rarity.4. Even within this biologically uniform group of flies, dispersal, range limits, and stream conditions all might play a role in rarity, and the importance of each of these factors appear to vary among species. Rather than looking for broad causes of rarity, future studies might be more fruitful if they looked at species-specific causes.									15	0	0	13	0	15			1752-458X			WOS:000262758900001

The number of farm recreation trip visits was estimated to have an own-price elasticity of -0.43 and an income elasticity of 0.24. Location of residence, race, and gender were found to be important determinants of the number of farm trips. The calculated consumer surplus is estimated at $174.82/trip, of which $33.50 is due to the rural landscape.									23	2	0	2	0	25			0162-1912			WOS:000258147300007

Improved thermoelectric performance in polycrystalline p-type Bi(2)Te(3) via an alkali metal salt hydrothermal nanocoating treatment approach								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS				104	3					034907	10.1063/1.2963706			AUG 1 2008	2008	We report herein a proof-of-principle study of grain boundary engineering in the polycrystalline p-type Bi(2)Te(3) system. Utilizing the recently developed hydrothermal nanocoating treatment technique, we fabricated an alkali-metal(s)-containing surface layer on the p-Bi(2)Te(3) bulk grain, which in turn became part of the grain boundary upon hot pressing densification. Compared to the untreated bulk reference, the dimensionless figure of merit ZT has been improved by similar to 30% in the Na-treated sample chiefly due to the reduced thermal conductivity, and similar to 38% in the Rb-treated sample mainly owing to the improved power factor. The grain boundary phase provides a new avenue by which one can potentially decouple the otherwise inter-related electrical resistivity, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductivity within one thermoelectric material.

Hot topic: Prepubertal ovariectomy alters the development of myoepithelial cells in the bovine mammary gland								JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE				91	8			2992	2995		10.3168/jds.2008-1191			AUG 2008	2008	Prepubertal ovariectomy can dramatically inhibit mammary development, but the mechanism of inhibition is not well characterized. Holstein heifers were ovariectomized (OVX) or sham operated but left intact (INT) at d 40 and then sacrificed at d 55, 70, 85, 100, 130, or 160 to provide tissues for histologic analysis of cell proliferation. Our histologic analyses unexpectedly revealed a pronounced effect of ovariectomy on myoepithelial cell development. Myoepithelial cells were identified on the basis of location, morphology, and immunohistochemical staining for a-smooth muscle actin (SMA). Vascular smooth muscle staining served as an internal positive control for all immunohistochemical analyses. Mammary tissues from d 40 heifers had an abundance of SMA(+) cells associated with the ductal parenchyma. In INT heifers, the frequency of SMA(+) cells decreased as development progressed. Only a limited number of isolated SMA(+) cells were observed in d 70 to d 160 INT heifers. In OVX heifers, SMA(+) cells were abundant, had elongated morphology, and frequently stained more intensively than vascular smooth muscle cells. The intense SMA staining and altered morphology was most prominent in older heifers. Limited analysis of gene expression revealed that maspin, a protease inhibitor expressed by myoepithelial cells, was expressed in parenchyma from both INT and OVX heifers. Our hypothesis is that ovarian secretions stimulate epithelial proliferation, and block myoepithelial differentiation. Myoepithelial cells are known to limit parenchymal cell proliferation. Ovariectomy may thus remove an estrogenic growth stimulus and permit the emergence of inhibitory cell populations that further limit parenchymal expansion. Our observation has important implications for control mechanisms that regulate parenchymal development.									7	0	0	7	0	7			0022-0302			WOS:000257876000007	18650275

Effects of feeding a dietary antioxidant in diets with oxidized fat on lactation performance and antioxidant status of the cow								JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE				91	8			3165	3172		10.3168/jds.2007-0737			AUG 2008	2008	The objective of the study was to evaluate the effect of feeding the dietary antioxidant Agrado Plus (AOX; Novus International, St. Louis, MO) in diets that contained 2% fresh fat (FF) or oxidized fat (OF) on milk production and composition and antioxidant status of cows during mid to late lactation. Forty-four mid to late lactating primiparous cows housed in a tie-stall barn were fed a diet that contained 2% FF for 15 d as adaptation period and then randomly allocated to 1 of the 4 dietary treatments (FF, FF+AOX, OF, OF+AOX) for 6 wk. Feeding AOX increased dry matter intake, 3.5% fat-corrected milk, and milk fat yield, and decreased milk protein content but not yield. Feeding OF increased milk fat yield, but decreased dry matter intake and body weight gain. Milk fat composition changed with treatments: AOX increased cis 18: 1 and decreased trans-11 18: 1, whereas OF decreased trans-9 and trans-11 18: 1 and cis-9, trans-11 18: 2 in milk. Plasma antioxidant enzymes and status were affected by treatments. Feeding OF increased superoxidase dismutase activity but decreased plasma antioxidant status, whereas AOX supplementation increased glutathione peroxidase activity across fat types and increased the antioxidant status and superoxidase dismutase activity when feeding OF diets. It can be concluded that feeding AOX improved lactation performance and the antioxidant status of the cow across fat types, and feeding OF increased milk fat yield but decreased dry matter intake, body weight gain, and antioxidant status. The negative effects of feeding OF were partially alleviated by AOX.									23	6	0	22	1	30			0022-0302			WOS:000257876000025	18650293

This paper provides a theoretical investigation of the persistent differences in income distribution across countries over time. Motivated by the relationship between income distribution and public spending at different school levels for a broad range of countries over the past 30 years, the analysis centers on the role of public education where specific investments interact with political involvement by different socio-economic groups. Socio-economic groups may form lobbies to influence education policy making. The formation of lobbies is endogenous. Persistent inequality is caused by persistent lobbying efforts of the wealthy that lead to an allocation of public education spending more biased toward them. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V.

In vivo strains in the femur of river cooter turtles (Pseudemys concinna) during terrestrial locomotion: tests of force-platform models of loading mechanics								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY				211	15			2397	2407		10.1242/jeb.018986			AUG 1 2008	2008	Previous analyses of ground reaction force (GRF) and kinematic data from river cooter turtles (Pseudemys concinna) during terrestrial walking led to three primary conclusions about the mechanics of limb bone loading in this lineage: ( 1) the femur was loaded in a combination of axial compression, bending and torsion, similar to previously studied non-avian reptiles, ( 2) femoral shear stresses were high despite the possession of a reduced tail in turtles that does not drag on the ground and ( 3) stress-based calculations of femoral safety factors indicated high values in bending and torsion, similar to other reptiles and suggesting that substantial 'overbuilding' of limb bones could be an ancestral feature of tetrapods. Because force-platform analyses produce indirect estimates of bone loading, we sought to validate these conclusions by surgically implanting strain gauges on turtle femora to directly measure in vivo strains during terrestrial walking. Strain analyses verified axial compression and bending as well as high torsion in turtle femora, with peak axial strains comparable to those of other non-avian reptiles at similar walking speeds but higher peak shear strains approaching 2000 mu epsilon. Planar strain analyses showed patterns of neutral axis (NA) of femoral bending orientations and shifting generally consistent with our previous force-platform analyses of bone stresses, tending to place the anterior and dorsal aspects of the femur in tension and verifying an unexpected pattern from our force studies that differs from patterns in other non-avian reptiles. Calculated femoral safety factors were 3.8 in torsion and ranged from 4.4 to 6.9 in bending. Although these safety factors in bending were lower than values derived from our stress-based calculations, they are similar to strain-based safety factors calculated for other non-avian reptiles in terrestrial locomotion and are still high compared with safety factors calculated for limb bones of birds and mammals. These findings are consistent with conclusions drawn from our previous models of limb bone stresses in turtles and suggest that not only are turtle limb bones 'overbuilt' in terms of resisting the loads that they experience during locomotion but also, across tetrapod lineages, elevated torsion and high limb bone safety factors may be primitive features of limb bone design.									21	0	0	18	1	22			0022-0949			WOS:000257620300013	18626073

The foundation of this new approach is a simplified procedure for obtaining a joint distribution of peak ground surface acceleration (a(max)) and moment magnitude of earthquake (M-w) at any given locality in the United States based on the USGS website data. The developed joint probability distribution of a(max) and M-w can be readily combined with the conditional probability of liquefaction (given a pair of a(max) and M-w) to obtain the total probability of liquefaction at a given site in a specified exposure time. Detailed formulation of the new approach is presented and demonstrated with examples.									27	3	0	0	0	30			1090-0241			WOS:000257762800002

However, rapid tool wear is still one of the major hurdles affecting the wide implementation of hard turning in industry. Better prediction of the CBN tool wear progression helps to optimize cutting conditions and/or tool geometry to reduce tool wear, which further helps to make hard turning a viable technology. The objective of this study is to design a novel but simple neural network-based generalized optimal estimator for CBN tool wear prediction in hard turning. The proposed estimator is based on a fully forward connected neural network with cutting conditions and machining time as the inputs and tool flank wear as the output. Extended Kalman filter algorithm is utilized as the network training algorithm to speed up the learning convergence. Network neuron connection is optimized using a destructive optimization algorithm. Besides performance comparisons with the CBN tool wear measurements in hard turning, the proposed tool wear estimator is also evaluated against a multilayer perceptron neural network modeling approach and/or an analytical modeling approach, and it has been proven to be faster, more accurate, and more robust. Although this neural network-based estimator is designed for CBN tool wear modeling in this study, it is expected to be applicable to other tool wear modeling applications.									33	1	0	0	0	34			0956-5515	1572-8145		WOS:000257237700002		
J	Salehi-Khojin, Amin; Bashash, Saeid; Jalili, Nader								Modeling and experimental vibration analysis of nanomechanical cantilever active probes								JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING				18	8					085008	10.1088/0960-1317/18/8/085008			AUG 2008	2008	Nanomechanical cantilever (NMC) active probes have recently received increased attention in a variety of nanoscale sensing and measurement applications. Current modeling practices call for a uniform cantilever beam without considering the intentional jump discontinuities associated with the piezoelectric layer attachment and the NMC cross-sectional step. This paper presents a comprehensive modeling framework for modal characterization and dynamic response analysis of NMC active probes with geometrical discontinuities. The entire length of the NMC is divided into three segments of uniform beams followed by applying appropriate continuity conditions. The characteristics matrix equation is then used to solve for system natural frequencies and mode shapes. Using an equivalent electromechanical moment of a piezoelectric layer, forced motion analysis of the system is carried out. An experimental setup consisting of a commercial NMC active probe from Veeco and a state-of-the-art microsystem analyzer, the MSA-400 from Polytec, is developed to verify the theoretical developments proposed here. Using a parameter estimation technique based on minimizing the modeling error, optimal values of system parameters are identified. Mode shapes and the modal frequency response of the system for the first three modes determined from the proposed model are compared with those obtained from the experiment and commonly used theory for uniform beams. Results indicate that the uniform beam model fails to accurately predict the actual system response, especially in multiple-mode operation, while the proposed discontinuous beam model demonstrates good agreement with the experimental data. Such detailed and accurate modeling framework can lead to significant enhancement in the sensitivity of piezoelectric-based NMC sensors for use in variety of sensing and imaging applications.									27	1	0	0	1	28			0960-1317			WOS:000257891600010		
J	Joshi, Sagar D.; Webb, Ken								Variation of cyclic strain parameters regulates development of elastic modulus in fibroblast/substrate constructs								JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC RESEARCH				26	8			1105	1113		10.1002/jor.20626			AUG 2008	2008	Dynamic mechanical culture systems are a widely studied approach for improving the functional mechanical properties of tissue engineering constructs intended for loading-bearing orthopedic applications such as tendon/ligament reconstruction. The design of effective mechanical stimulation regimes requires a fundamental understanding of the effects of cyclic strain parameters on the resulting construct properties. Toward this end, these studies employed a modular cyclic strain bioreactor system and fibroblast-seeded, porous polyurethane substrates to systematically investigate the effect of varying cyclic strain amplitude, rate, frequency, and daily cycle number on construct mechanical properties. Significant differences were observed in response to variation of all four loading parameters tested. In general, the highest values of elastic modulus within each experimental group were observed at low to intermediate values of the experimental variables tested, corresponding to the low to subphysiological range (2.5% strain amplitude, 25%/s strain rate, 0.1-0.5 Hz frequency, and 7,200-28,800 cycles/day). These studies demonstrate that fibroblasts are sensitive and responsive to multiple characteristics of their mechanical environment, and suggest that systematic optimization of dynamic culture conditions may be useful for the acceleration of construct maturation and mechanical function.

J	Schutt, David J.; Haemmerich, Dieter								Effects of variation in perfusion rates and of perfusion models in computational models of radio frequency tumor ablation								MEDICAL PHYSICS				35	8			3462	3470		10.1118/1.2948388			AUG 2008	2008	Purpose: Finite element method (FEM) models are commonly used to simulate radio frequency (RF) tumor ablation. Prior FEM models of RF ablation have either ignored the temperature dependent effect of microvascular perfusion, or implemented the effect using simplified algorithms to reduce computational complexity. In this FEM modeling study, the authors compared the effect of different microvascular perfusion algorithms on ablation zone dimensions with two commercial RF electrodes in hepatic tissue. They also examine the effect of tissue type and inter-patient variation of perfusion on ablation zone dimensions. Methods and Materials: The authors created FEM models of an internally cooled and multi-tined expandable electrode. RF voltage was applied to both electrodes (for 12 or 15 min, respectively) such that the maximum temperature in the model was 105 degrees C. Temperature dependent microvascular perfusion was implemented using three previously reported methodologies: cessation above 60 degrees C, a standard first-order Arrhenius model with decreasing perfusion with increasing degree of vascular stasis, and an Arrhenius model that included the effects of increasing perfusion at the ablation zone boundary due to hyperemia. To examine the effects of interpatient variation, simulations were performed with base line and +/- 1 standard deviation values of perfusion. The base line perfusion was also varied to simulate the difference between normal and cirrhotic liver tissue. Results: The ablation zone volumes with the cessation above 60 degrees C perfusion algorithm and with the more complex Arrhenius model were up to 70% and 25% smaller, respectively, compared to the standard Arrhenius model. Ablation zone volumes were up to similar to 175% and similar to 100% different between the simulations where -1 and +1 standard deviation values of perfusion were used in normal and cirrhotic liver tissue, respectively. Conclusions: The choice of microvascular perfusion algorithm has significant effects on final ablation zone dimensions in FEM models of RF ablation. The authors also found that both interpatient variation in base line tissue perfusion and the reduction in perfusion due to cirrhosis have considerable effect on ablation zone dimensions.

Survival of Didymella bryoniae in infested muskmelon crowns in South Carolina								PLANT DISEASE				92	8			1223	1228		10.1094/PDIS-92-8-1223			AUG 2008	2008	The crowns of muskmelon (Cucumis melo subsp. melo) plants are susceptible to cankers caused by the fungal pathogen Didymella bryoniae. The objective of this study was to compare the length of time D. bryoniae survived in infested crowns that were buried or left on the soil surface. Dried crowns with cankers were buried 12.5 cm deep, placed on the soil surface, or placed on top of raised beds covered with white-on-black polyethylene mulch from July 2002 to June 2003, December 2003 to October 2004, July 2004 to November 2005, and November 2005 10 November 2007. At regular intervals, crowns or crown debris were retrieved, washed, cut into pieces, and cultured on semiselective medium to recover D. bryoniae. D. bryoniae was not recovered from crowns buried 35 and 45 weeks in 2003 and 2004 but was recovered from 2.5% of crowns buried 66 weeks in 2005. In contrast, D. bryoniae was recovered after 48, 45, 66, and 103 weeks from 66, 6.3, 2.5, and 10% of crowns on the soil surface in 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2007, respectively. D. bryoniae also was recovered after 66 and 103 weeks from 12.5 and 8% of crowns on mulched beds in 2005 and 2007. In two additional experiments, the pathogen was recovered from 15.0 and 20.1% of infested muskmelon debris left in place for 42 and 38 weeks on polyethylene-mulched beds. To reduce the time D. bryoniae survives after a cucurbit crop, crop debris should be incorporated into soil promptly after harvest.									10	0	0	10	1	11			0191-2917			WOS:000257935700013

Expression and evolutionary features of the hexokinase gene family in Arabidopsis								PLANTA				228	3			411	425		10.1007/s00425-008-0746-9			AUG 2008	2008	Arabidopsis hexokinase1 (HXK1) is a moonlighting protein that has separable functions in glucose signaling and in glucose metabolism. In this study, we have characterized expression features and glucose phosphorylation activities of the six HXK gene family members in Arabidopsis thaliana. Three of the genes encode catalytically active proteins, including a stromal-localized HXK3 protein that is expressed mostly in sink organs. We also show that three of the genes encode hexokinase-like (HKL) proteins, which are about 50% identical to AtHXK1, but do not phosphorylate glucose or fructose. Expression studies indicate that both HKL1 and HKL2 transcripts occur in most, if not all, plant tissues and that both proteins are targeted within cells to mitochondria. The HKL1 and HKL2 proteins have 6-10 amino acid insertions/deletions (indels) at the adenosine binding domain. In contrast, HKL3 transcript was detected only in flowers, the protein lacks the noted indels, and the protein has many other amino acid changes that might compromise its ability even to bind glucose or ATP. Activity measurements of HXKs modified by site-directed mutagenesis suggest that the lack of catalytic activities in the HKL proteins might be attributed to any of numerous existing changes. Sliding windows analyses of coding sequences in A. thaliana and A. lyrata ssp. lyrata revealed a differential accumulation of nonsynonymous changes within exon 8 of both HKL1 and HXK3 orthologs. We further discuss the possibility that the non-catalytic HKL proteins have regulatory functions instead of catalytic functions.									39	6	0	38	0	42			0032-0935			WOS:000257594800005	18481082

Real-time wide-angle X-ray diffraction during polyethylene blown film extrusion								POLYMER ENGINEERING AND SCIENCE				48	8			1487	1494		10.1002/pen.21111			AUG 2008	2008	Real-time wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) measurements during blown film extrusion of low-density polyethylene are reported in this study. WAXD patterns were obtained at different axial positions in the blown film line starting from a location near the die and extending up to the nip-roller. The X-ray diffraction patterns from the bubble were analyzed for crystalline growth along the bubble. From the evolution of (110) and (200) peaks, it is evident that the crystallization process starts near the frost-line height (FLH), shows a steep growth immediately past the FLH, and then plateaus at higher axial distances near the nip-rolls. The real-time crystallinity profiles obtained from WAXD were consistent with those measured using real-time Raman spectroscopy.									7	0	0	0	0	7			0032-3888			WOS:000257906900005

For example, such problems may arise when the quality characteristic of interest is tensile strength or breaking stress. The parametric bootstrap method is used to develop a quality control chart for monitoring percentiles when process measurements have a Birnbaum-Saunders distribution. Through extensive Monte Carlo simulations' we investigate the behavior and performance of the proposed bootstrap percentile charts. Average ran lengths of the proposed percentile chart are also investigated. Illustrative examples with the data concerning the tensile strength of the aluminum sheeting are presented.

We recently observed a profound loss of trabecular bone in mice after whole-body HZE irradiation. The goal of this study was to examine morphology in bones that were excluded from a Fe-56(26+) beam used to irradiate the body. Using 10-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats and excluding the hind limbs and pelvis, we irradiated animals with 0, 1, 2 and 4 Gy Fe-56(26+) ions and killed them humanely after 9 months. Animals grew throughout the experiment. Trabecular bone volume, connectivity and thickness within the proximal tibiae were significantly lower than control in a dose-dependent manner. Irradiated animals generally had less body mass than controls, which largely accounted for the variability in bone parameters as determined by ANCOVA. Likewise, lower cortical parameters were associated with reduced mass. However, lesser trabecular thickness in the 4-Gy group could not be attributed to body mass alone. Indicators of bone metabolism were generally unchanged, suggesting stabilized turnover. Exposure to Fe-16(26+) ions can alter trabecular microarchitecture in shielded bones. Reduced body mass seems to be correlated with these deficits of trabecular and cortical bone.

Arbitrarily normalized coefficients, information sets, and false reports of "biases" in binary outcome models								REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS				90	3			406	413		10.1162/rest.90.3.406			AUG 2008	2008	Empirical researchers sometimes misinterpret how additional regressors, heterogeneity corrections, and multilevel factors impact the interpretation of the estimated parameters in binary outcome models such as logit and probit. This can result in incorrect inferences about the importance of incorporating such features in these nonlinear statistical models. Some reports of biases in binary outcome models appear related to the arbitrary variance normalization required in binary outcome models. A focus on readily interpretable numerical quantities, rather than conveniently chosen "effects" as measured by arbitrarily scaled coefficients, would eliminate nearly all of the interpretation problems we highlight in this paper.									15	0	0	2	0	15			0034-6535			WOS:000258260500002

A fully transient model for long-term plutonium transport in the Savannah River Site vadose zone: Root water uptake								VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL				7	3			1099	1109		10.2136/vzj2007.0134			AUG 2008	2008	Improved understanding of flow and radionuclide transport in vadose zone sediments is fundamental to future planning involving radioactive materials. To that end, long-term experiments were conducted at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina, where a series of lysimeters containing sources of plutonium (Pu) in different oxidation states was placed in the shallow subsurface and exposed to the environment for 2 to 11 yr. Then, sediment Pu activity concentrations were measured along vertical cores taken from the lysimeters. Results showed anomalous activity distributions below the source, with significant migration of Pu above the source. A previously developed reactive transport model with surface-mediated redox reactions successfully simulated the lysimeter results below the source, assuming a steady, net downward flow. To simulate more realistic field conditions, a transient variably saturated flow model with root water uptake is developed and coupled to the reactive transport model. Overall, the fully transient analysis shows results nearly identical to the much simpler steady flow analysis. Thus, the surface-mediated redox hypothesis remains consistent with the below-source experimental data, the most important variable affecting transport being the oxidation state of the source material. However, none of the models studied could produce the upward Pu transport observed in the data. The hydraulic and chemical mechanisms tested as potential causes for upward migration-a modified root distribution, hysteresis, and air-content dependent oxidation-yielded little or no enhancement of the upward Pu movement. This suggests another transport mechanism such as root Pu uptake and translocation in the transpiration stream.									14	0	0	5	0	14			1539-1663			WOS:000258444600015		
J	Gaworecki, Kristen M.; Klaine, Stephen J.				Klaine, Stephen/C-5352-2011				Behavioral and biochemical responses of hybrid striped bass during and after fluoxetine exposure								AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY				88	4			207	213		10.1016/j.aquatox.2008.04.011			JUL 30 2008	2008	Environmental contaminants, including pharmaceuticals, can alter behavior and possibly impact population and community structures. One important behavior that could be impacted is the ability to capture prey. We hypothesized that sublethal fluoxetine exposure may lead to feeding behavior abnormalities in hybrid striped bass (Morone saxatilis x M. chrysops). Fluoxetine is an antidepressant that acts as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). A change in serotonin levels affects multiple behaviors including feeding, which is an important aspect in ecological fitness. This research characterized the impact of sublethal fluoxetine exposures on the ability of hybrid striped bass to capture fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas). Bass were exposed to fluoxetine (0.0 mu g/l, 23.2 +/- 6.6, 51.4 +/- 10.9 and 100.9 +/- 18.6 mu g/l,) for 6 days, followed by a 6-day recovery period in clean water. Brain serotonin activity and the ability of bass to capture prey were measured every third day. Exposed fish exhibited a concentration- and duration-dependent decrease in ability to capture prey. Increased time to capture prey also correlated with decreases in brain serotonin activity. Serotonin activity also decreased in an exposure time- and concentration-dependent manner, maximally inhibited 23.7, 28.0, and 49.1% of control in the low, medium, and high treatments, respectively. Serotonin levels in exposed fish did not recover to control levels during the 6-day recovery period. These results suggest that sublethal exposure to fluoxetine decreases the ability of hybrid striped bass to capture prey and that serotonin can be used as a biomarker of exposure and effect.

Predicting how polyphenol antioxidants prevent DNA damage by binding to iron								INORGANIC CHEMISTRY				47	14			6153	6161		10.1021/ic7022727			JUL 21 2008	2008	Prevention of oxidative DNA damage due to hydroxyl radical is important for the prevention and treatment of disease. Because of their widely recognized antioxidant ability, 12 polyphenolic compounds were assayed by gel electrophoresis to directly quantify the inhibition of DNA damage by polyphenols with Fe2+ and H2O2. All of the polyphenol compounds have IC50 values ranging from 1-59 mu M and inhibit 100% of DNA damage at 50-500 mu M concentrations. Gel electrophoresis results with iron(II)EDTA and UV-vis spectroscopy experiments confirm that binding of the polyphenol to iron is essential for antioxidant activity. Furthermore, antioxidant potency of polyphenol compounds correlates to the pK(a) of the first phenolic hydrogen, representing the first predictive model of antioxidant potency based on metal-binding. Understanding this iron-coordination mechanism for polyphenol antioxidant activity will aid in the design of more-potent antioxidants to treat and prevent diseases caused by oxidative stress, and help develop structure-activity relationships for these compounds.									51	1	0	39	0	54			0020-1669			WOS:000257642700011	18553907

A new low in propagation loss of <2.0 dB/cm was achieved for a 4 mu m wide waveguide by optimizing the cladding material and fabrication process. The coupling efficiency between the LRSPP waveguide and the optical fiber is studied theoretically and experimentally for different widths of Au stripes and various cladding thicknesses. Lower coupling loss is found when the cladding thickness is close to the mode diameter of the butt-coupled fiber. Based on the 2D distribution of SPP modes calculated by a finite-difference mode solver, a symmetric structure of multilayer claddings with different refractive indices is proposed to optimize device insertion loss.

Computational feasibility analysis of direct-adhesion polymer-to-metal hybrid technology for load-bearing body-in-white structural components, J. Mater. Process. Technol.]. Within this approach, the necessary level of polymer-to-metal mechanical interconnectivity is attained through the use of polymer-to-metal adhesion promoters. Such promoters are applied to the metal stamping prior to their placement into the injection mold for plastic-subcomponent injection molding. The resulting enhanced polymer-to-metal adhesion affects the way injected plastic develops residual stresses while it is cooled from the plastic-melt temperature down to room temperature. In the present work, injection-molding mold-filling and material-packing analyses are combined with a structural analysis involving polymer/metal adhesion analysis to assess the extent of residual stresses and warping in a prototypical direct-adhesion PMH component. The magnitude and the distribution of such stresses and distortions are critical for the component assembly, performance and durability. The results obtained show that adhesion at the metal-stamping/plastics-subcomponent interfaces, whose presence is the bases for the direct-adhesion PMH technology, has a profound effect on the distribution and magnitude of residual stresses/distortions in the PMH component and that it must be taken into account when the component and its manufacturing processes are being designed.

Computer models have been used to determine tissue temperatures during tumor ablation procedures. To simulate large vessels, either constant wall temperature or constant convective heat transfer coefficient (h) have been assumed at the vessel surface to simulate convection. However, the actual distribution of the temperature on the vessel wall is non-uniform and time-varying, and this feature makes the convective coefficient variable.Methods: This paper presents a realistic time-varying model in which h is a function of the temperature distribution at the vessel wall. The finite-element method (FEM) was employed in order to model RF hepatic ablation. Two geometrical configurations were investigated. The RF electrode was placed at distances of 1 and 5 mm from a large vessel (10 mm diameter).Results: When the ablation procedure takes longer than 1-2 min, the attained coagulation zone obtained with both time-varying h and constant h does not differ significantly. However, for short duration ablation (5-10 s) and when the electrode is 1 mm away from the vessel, the use of constant h can lead to errors as high as 20% in the estimation of the coagulation zone.Conclusion: For tumor ablation procedures typically lasting at least 5 min, this study shows that modeling the heat sink effect of large vessels by applying constant h as a boundary condition will yield precise results while reducing computational complexity. However, for other thermal therapies with shorter treatment using a time-varying h may be necessary.									22	1	0	10	0	22			1475-925X			WOS:000258515100001	18620566

However, its correlation with carrier doping has not been reported. We report on the Meissner effect found in thin films consisting of assembled boron (B)-doped single-walled CNTs (B-SWNTs). We find that only B-SWNT films consisting of low boron concentration leads to evident Meissner effect with T(c) = 12 K and also that a highly homogeneous ensemble of the B-SWNTs is crucial. The first-principles electronic-structure study of the B-SWNTs strongly supports these results.									41	2	0	1	0	42			0031-9007			WOS:000257553700054	18764216

Mossbauer spectroscopy enables differentiation among relatively large Fe(3)C, alpha-Fe, and nanosized superparamagnetic fee gamma-Fe particles. The antiferromagnetic configuration of gamma-Fe nanoparticles yields a significant fraction of uncompensated spins, producing a weak ferromagnetism that allows estimation of size (2-3 nm) via magnetization in zero field versus variable field cooling. This property of gamma-Fe nanoparticles has not been previously employed.

Cyclopolymerization afforded an insoluble, non-luminescent material likely due to cross-addition reactions between phenylene vinylene olefin and trifluorovinyl ether (TFVE). However, 1,2-bis(4-formylphenoxy)hexafluorocyclobutane was polymerized with 1,4-dihexyloxy-2,5-xylenebis(triphenylphosphoniumbromide) and 1-methoxy-4-(2-ethyl hexyloxy)-2,5-xylenebis(triphenylphosphoniumbromide) under Wittig conditions to yield two novel poly(perfluorocyclobutyl-co-phenylene vinylene) polymers. The polymers are of moderate molecular weight (8600-8700 M-n), show excellent thermal stability (T-d = 390-405 degrees C), and are readily soluble in common organic solvents. The materials are highly fluorescent in both solution and thin film with solution quantum yields of 68 and 71%. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Rescaling the Human Footprint: A tool for conservation planning at an ecoregional scale								LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING				87	1			42	53		10.1016/j.landurbplan.2008.04.005			JUL 3 2008	2008	Measuring and mapping human influence at the global scale suffers from problems of accuracy and resolution. To evaluate the magnitude of this problem we mapped the Human Footprint (HF) for the Northern Appalachian/Acadian ecoregion at a 90-m resolution using best available data on human settlement, access, land use change, and electrical power infrastructure. Such a map measures the magnitude of human transformation of a landscape, scaled between Human Footprint scores of 0 and 100. Comparison with a 1-km resolution Global Human Footprint map revealed similar spatial patterns of human influence. The correlation between HF scores, however, declined with the size of the area compared, with the rank correlation between ecoregional and global HF scores ranging between 0.67 for 100% of the ecoregion and 0.41 for 0.1 % of the ecoregion. This indicates that rescaling the map to a finer resolution leads to improvements that increase as the planning area becomes smaller. The map reveals that 46% of the ecoregion has HF <= 20 (compared to 59% in the global analysis) and 34% had HF > 40 (compared to 21 % in the global analysis). These results demonstrate the benefit of performing region-scale Human Footprint mapping to support conservation-based land use planning at the ecoregional to the local scale. This exercise also provides a data framework with which to model regionally plausible Future Human Footprint scenarios. These and other benefits of producing a regional-scale Human Footprint must be carefully weighed against the costs involved, in light of the region's conservation planning needs. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.

Adsorption isotherms were measured for complexation of 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene (4,6-DMDBT) from n-heptane onto the TAPA-functionalized silica adsorbent. At 25 degrees C, maximum adsorption capacity was measured to be 58.6 mg/g for binding 4,6-DMDBT, which is 4-fold higher than that of the nonfunctionalized, bare silica sample with a surface area of 480 m(2)/g. The results from batch studies suggest that adsorption occurs via a 1:1 complexation between 4,6-DMDBT and TAPA. Adsorption isotherm data were collected at 0, 25, and 40 degrees C; these data were used to develop a relationship between the Henry's constant for adsorption and temperature. The molar enthalpy of adsorption was calculated to be Delta H-ads = -12.1 kJ/mol; this value is evidence for formation of pi-electron acceptor-donor complexes.									8	0	0	2	0	8			0888-5885			WOS:000257150000021

Design of a modular bioreactor to incorporate both perfusion flow and hydrostatic compression for tissue engineering applications								ANNALS OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING				36	7			1228	1241		10.1007/s10439-008-9505-0			JUL 2008	2008	Physiological models have demonstrated that cells undergo a cyclic regimen of hydrostatic compression and fluid shear stress within the lacunar-canalicular porosity of bone. A new modular bioreactor was designed to incorporate both perfusion fluid flow and hydrostatic compression in an effort to more accurately simulate the mechanical loading and stress found in natural bone in vivo. The bioreactor design incorporated custom and off-the-shelf components to produce levels of mechanical stimuli relevant to the physiologic range, including hydrostatic compression exceeding 300 kPa and perfusion shear stress of 0.7 dyne/cm(2). Preliminary findings indicated that the novel system facilitated the viable growth of cells on discrete tissue engineering scaffolds. The bioreactor has established an experimental platform for ongoing investigation of the interactive effect of perfusion fluid flow and hydrostatic compression on multiple cell types.									17	1	0	14	0	18			0090-6964			WOS:000256318200013	18438713

This method is advantageous because substrates are easy to prepare and the silver metal surface is inherently clean without spectroscopic background. Silver compounds were melted into 1-2 mm slugs on quartz slides and plasma treated for different lengths of time. Silver chloride was found to be the best compound to make reproducible and stable SERS substrates. SERS activity of the substrates was tested using L-tryptophan, 4-mercaptobenzoic acid, and adenine.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0003-7028			WOS:000257637200002	18935819

Sensitivity to Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol is selectively enhanced in beta-arrestin2-/- mice								BEHAVIOURAL PHARMACOLOGY				19	4			298	307					JUL 2008	2008	Little is known about the roles of beta-arrestins in the regulation of brain CBI cannabinoid receptors. This study investigated the role of beta-arrestin2 in cannabinoid behavioral effects using beta-arrestin2-/- mice and their wild-type counterparts. A variety of cannabinoid ligands from different chemical classes that exhibit a variety of efficacies for activation of CB(1) receptors were investigated, including Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol, CP55940, methanandamide, JWH-073, and 0-1812. Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol produced both greater antinociception and greater decreases in body temperature in beta-arrestin2 -/- compared with beta-arrestin2 +/+ mice. No significant differences were, however, present in either assay for the other CB, agonists. Antagonist radioligand binding indicated no difference in the density of cannabinoid CB, receptors in the cerebellum, cortex, or hippocampus of beta-arrestin2 +/+ and -/- mice. These data demonstrate that beta-arrestin2 may regulate cannabinoid CB, receptor sensitivity in an agonist-specific manner.

Recognition of the unique structure of DNA : RNA hybrids								BIOCHIMIE				90	7			1026	1039		10.1016/j.biochi.2008.04.011			JUL 2008	2008	Targeting nucleic acids using small molecules routinely uses the end products in the conversion pathway of "DNA to RNA, RNA to protein". However, the intermediate processes in this path have not always been targeted. The DNA-RNA interaction, specifically DNA:RNA hybrid formation, provides a unique target for controlling the transfer of genetic information through binding by small molecules. Not only do DNA:RNA hybrids differ in conformation from widely targeted DNA and RNA, the low occurrence within biological systems further validates their therapeutic potential. Surprisingly, a survey of the literature reveals only a handful of ligands that bind DNA:RNA hybrids; in comparison, the number of ligands designed to target DNA is in the thousands. DNA:RNA hybrids, from their scientific inception to current applications in ligand targeting, are discussed.

The present study aimed to examine the relationship between asymmetry and the fluid media (air versus water) that an organism inhabits and, subsequently, to use these findings to test a novel hypothesis that fluid environments can impose selective forces acting to constrain asymmetry to maintain or enhance biomechanical function. We examined carapace asymmetry in 114 species (69 aquatic and 45 terrestrial) from the chelonian superfamily Testudinoidea. The results obtained indicate that environment is correlated with the degree of asymmetry, but in different directions for the two clades that comprise the Testudinoidea. Within the Testuguria, aquatic turtles have lower levels of asymmetry than terrestrial turtles, which is consistent with our proposed biomechanical hypothesis. This pattern was not observed within the Emydidae, possibly due to the much shorter time that terrestrial taxa in this clade have existed. Nevertheless, the present study provides the first evidence for a relationship between fluid media and asymmetry in any taxonomic group.

The low-angle peak was reproducible using different diffractometers and different sample-to-detector distances, and was observed for all pitch samples irrespective of the flow history, but not for carbon fibers derived from the same precursor fibers. The interplanar 002 peak at similar to 25 degrees was observed at the equatorial position, whereas, the peak at 7 degrees was in the meridional position, i.e., the peaks are nominally 90 degrees apart in an azimuthal scan. This signifies that the low angle peak was due to diffraction from planes that are orthogonal to (002) planes. The 7 degrees peak is equivalent to a d-spacing of 1.25 nm, which corresponds to the nominal lateral dimension of the mesogen molecules that constitute the mesophase pitch. A typical MALDI analysis showed predominance of molecular weights of similar to 500 au. Edges of such a constituent of mesophase pitch molecules, which lead to a lateral ordered spacing of approximately 1.1 nm, can lead to a diffraction peak at approximately 7 degrees.

The effect of crumb rubber modifier (CRM) on the performance properties of rubberized binders in HMA pavements								CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS				22	7			1368	1376		10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2007.04.010			JUL 2008	2008	The application of crumb rubber modifier (CRM) in asphalt mixtures is intended to improve the properties of binder by reducing the binder's inherent temperature susceptibility. During the interaction with asphalt binder, the CRM particles absorb a portion of the oils in asphalt binder and the particles swell; therefore increasing the viscosity and stiffness of the CRM binder. Still, the performance properties of CRM binders in hot mix asphalt (HMA) pavement are considered to be unclear due to the various interaction effects of CRM with asphalt binders, depending on the CRM percentage, source and size. In this study, a laboratory investigation was. conducted on the properties of CRM binders as a function of CRM processing method and percentages. A total of twenty-four CRM binders (3 binder sources * 2 CRM processing methods * 4 CRM percentages) were produced and artificially aged through an accelerated aging process. Evaluation of the CRM binders included the following testing procedures: Viscosity at high temperature, performance properties at high and intermediate temperatures, and cracking properties at low temperature. The results from this study indicated that the higher CRM percentages for CRM binders seemed to lead to a higher viscosity, a better rutting resistance and a less chance for low temperature cracking. In general, the ambient CRM was found to be more effective on producing the CRM binders that are more viscous And less susceptible to rutting and cracking. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Does a mixed-species landscape reduce inorganic-nitrogen leaching compared to a conventional St. Augustinegrass lawn?								CROP SCIENCE				48	4			1586	1594		10.2135/cropsci2007.09.0515			JUL-AUG 2008	2008	Low maintenance vegetation may reduce N leaching following establishment compared to routinely fertilized conventional turfgrass lawns. Therefore, using a field-scale facility we examined N leaching from contrasting residential landscape models established on a sandy soil. Four replications each of a St. Augustinegrass [Stenotaphrum secundatum (Walt.) Kuntze] monoculture (SA) and a mixed-species (MS) landscape were randomly assigned to 47.5-m(2) plots. Fertilizer N was applied to the SA landscape bimonthly at a rate of 50 kg ha(-1) (total of 900 kg N ha(-1)), while the MS landscape was fertilized bimonthly at a rate of 40 kg N ha-1 only during establishment (total of 480 kg ha(-1)). Data were collected for 3 yr (16 mo to 52 mo after planting). Cumulative mean inorganic-N leached was 4.1 kg ha(-1) and 7.4 kg ha(-1) for the SA and MS landscapes, respectively. Relatively long establishment requirements for the MS landscape led to significantly greater inorganic-N leaching (5.2 kg ha(-1)) in year 1 of the study compared to the SA landscape (1.3 kg ha(-1)). After year 1, inorganic-N leaching was comparable on both landscapes, although it was significantly less on the MS landscape in year 3 when no fertilizer was applied. Overall, inorganic-N leaching was low (<2% of applied N) on both landscapes following establishment, indicating the importance of management practices rather than species composition for reducing N leaching from residential land use.									17	0	0	16	0	17			0011-183X			WOS:000257974100037

Measurement of microstrains across loaded resin-dentin interfaces using microscopic moire interferometry								DENTAL MATERIALS				24	7			859	866		10.1016/j.dental.2007.10.005			JUL 2008	2008	Little is known about the mechanical behavior of resin-dentin interfaces during loading. The presence of relatively compliant hybrid and adhesive layers between stiffer dentin and resin composite should deform more during compressive loading.Objective. The objective of this study was to measure changes in microstrain across bonded dentin interfaces in real time using a recently developed microscope moire interferometer.Method. This system used a miniature moire interferometer, using two CCD cameras for simultaneous recording of longitudinal and transverse deformation fields, a piezotransducer for fringe shifting and use of a microscope objective with magnification up to 600x. Small beams (1 mm x 2 mm x 6 mm) of moist resin-bonded dentin covered with cross-lined diffraction grating replica were placed in a miniature compression tester to allow controlled loading from 2 to 37 N while imaging the interference fringe patterns.Results. Resin-dentin interfaces created by bonding dentin with Single Bond/Z100, under compressive loading, exhibited comparatively large strains across the adhesive-hybrid interface. When the wrapped phase maps were unwrapped to permit conversion of fringe order to displacements, the 2-D profiles of strain fields revealed non-uniform strains across the adhesive interface. In the adhesive/hybrid layer zone, the negative strain was larger (i.e. -6000 mu epsilon) than that seen in the adjacent resin composite or underlying mineralized dentin. The changes were elastic because they disappeared when the load was removed.Significance. Microscopic moire interferometry can be very useful in revealing real-time strain across bonded interfaces under load. (c) 2007 Academy of Dental Materials. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Compared with the RF polymer synthesized by the conventional hydrothermal method, microwave polymerization produced spherical beads with a higher surface area (1710 m(2)/g vs. 1080 m(2)/g), and smaller (similar to 700 nm vs. similar to 5 mu m) but more uniform bead sizes. The majority of their pores were micropores. As a result, the electrochemical capacitance of microwave-assisted nitrogen-doped carbons was significantly higher than that of materials prepared by the conventional hydrothermal method. Thus microwave-assisted polymerization followed by ammonia-assisted carbonization is a useful method to synthesize nitrogen-doped carbon gels for electrochemical double layer capacitors.

Characteristics we share with the other primates, such as complex diets, highly social lives, and extended juvenile periods, suggest that social learning may be important during ontogeny throughout the order. Although all young primates typically pay attention to feeding adults, great apes and callitrichids, in particular, acquire new foraging techniques through abilities unknown in other nonhuman primates; that is, they learn by imitation. However, ape social learning is almost exclusively infant-initiated, while adult callitrichids actively teach their young. It is unlikely that the same selective forces have acted to favor sophisticated social-learning mechanisms in both taxa.(3,4) Equipped with an ape brain, complex foraging methods, and a cooperative infant-care system, early hominins were uniquely poised to take social learning about food and foraging techniques to a new level.									50	0	0	47	0	51			1060-1538			WOS:000259161500005
